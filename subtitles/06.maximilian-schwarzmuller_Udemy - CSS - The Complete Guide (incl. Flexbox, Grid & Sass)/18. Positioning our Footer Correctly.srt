1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,580
So what is wrong with our footer?

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,030
Well as you can see, the footer is kind of positioned in the middle of nowhere,

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,800
this is also true for the customers page. For the starting page,

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,630
it's better because we have more content

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,850
but generally I think it would definitely make sense to think about the way, how to create a general

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:32,130
style, so a style in our shared.css file which defines that the footer is always positioned at the bottom

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,750
of our page.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,260
Now how could we acheive that?

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,210
Well what we basically need is we need a header right here,

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,410
then we need the main part which should leave us the gap for the footer at the bottom.

11
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:53,760
Now if we think back about our units module, why don't we simply add a height of 100vh,

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,490
so

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:03,210
100% of the viewport to our main element and then deduct the height of our nav bar because

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,600
that's the space the nav bar needs at the beginning,

15
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,070
so this means our main part would now simply end right here

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,990
and if we then also deduct the space our footer needs, then we will ensure that the footer is always

17
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,490
positioned at the bottom of the page.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,310
Now to achieve that, we simply need two things, we need to select our main element and then we need a

19
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,780
calculation formula.

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:38,510
We already applied such a formula right here in our shared.css file because if we scroll down a bit

21
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,640
to the main navigation selector, we have this formula,

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,790
this calculation, so we know how to do this basically.

23
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:51,470
Now what formula would we need to make sure that the footer is positioned according to the way I just

24
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,340
described?

25
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:58,610
Well basically, we could add the main selector as a starting point right here in our shared.css file.

26
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,820
Then we would need a minimum height,

27
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,860
that's important because that's always the height our main element should have

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,700
and this should be calculated based on 100% of the viewport height minus,

29
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:20,080
now what's the minus? Well the minus must be our space that the navigation bar needs,

30
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,730
we learned that in the last lecture,

31
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:29,450
this is 3.5rem, like that and minus the space our footer needs.

32
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,520
Now what is the space our footer needs?

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:40,220
Well basically, if we inspect the footer like that, this is 19 pixels plus 64 pixels for the top and

34
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,200
bottom padding,

35
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:47,880
so this means we have 83 pixels plus the 48 pixels for the top margin.

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,630
So in total, this would be 131 pixels

37
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,950
and if we turn that into rem, we know 1rem is 60 pixels, this would be 8rem.

38
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:05,120
So this means we need to deduct this 8rem right here, like that.

39
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,590
So this is the first step,

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,520
this is the calculation formula we need, if we now reload the page, we can see that we have an issue right here,

41
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,260
it's not perfectly positioned at the bottom.

42
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:23,400
If we go to the customers page, it's also not perfect. But let's start on the landing page right here because

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,810
here on the starting page,

44
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,750
it looks better but let's inspect the structure for a page and let's see if it's really correct already

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:39,250
here because if we go right here into our main element, we can see that one thing is missing actually,

46
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:49,000
we are missing a top margin because the main element should not be hidden below our nav element. At

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,510
the moment,

48
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:58,560
this is not the case because we added the margin right here, this margin top to our product overview ID,

49
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,670
this one right here,

50
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:06,520
our section element. The better approach would be to add such a 3.5rem margin top to the shared.css

51
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,980
file.

52
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:16,080
So let's add margin top right here of 3.5rem like that

53
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,800
and if we now reload the page, we cannot see a difference but that's simply due to margin collapsing because

54
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:29,820
as we can see on product overview, we have our margin top and we also have it for our main element right here.

55
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,630
What we can do now is we can go to our main.css file and get rid of that margin top right here because

56
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,010
we now defined a general rule in our shared.css file, right here.

57
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,920
If I now reload the page, this looks all right

58
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:51,080
and if we now have a look at the packages page, we can see it's still not working perfectly and the

59
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,170
same thing is true for the customers page. If we go to our packages page and inspect the main element,

60
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,190
we can see that we already added a margin right here of 3rem.

61
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:13,050
Now if we go into our code, into the packages.css file, we can see that this is basically applied right

62
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,290
here in our media query.

63
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,850
Now we don't need that anymore actually, so let's delete that part right here because we now have this general

64
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:29,790
rule and if we now go back and reload the page, we can see that it works now because as you can see, we

65
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:37,860
now specified the margin top directly right here in the main element based on our shared.css rule

66
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,870
and therefore, we don't need that rule in the media query anymore

67
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:48,590
and with that, our footer is now also positioned correctly right here on the packages page.

68
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,630
Important,

69
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,980
we still have this padding of 2rem to the top, so this one, this is simply here to ensure that we have

70
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,820
a distance between the nav bar and the actual packages, like that

71
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,240
but as you can see, this is just the padding, on top of the padding

72
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,130
we have our margin, if we scroll down, we can see it,

73
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,770
this is the 56 pixels that we defined

74
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,560
and these are the 3.5rem that we specified in our shared file

75
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,840
and with that, we also fixed the footer right here.

76
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,210
Now let's have a look at the final page, the customers page because here, we still have kind of a mess.

77
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,290
If we have a look at our code,

78
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:34,130
so in the customers.css file right here, we can first see that we have this testimonial first of type,

79
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,850
this margin top that we added,

80
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:42,200
so basically the margin, that one right here. We don't need that anymore because now we specified that

81
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:49,810
we need a margin to the top for the main element already in the shared.css file, this is this 3.5rem margin

82
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,690
we defined.

83
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:58,160
So the remaining margin we need right here to ensure that this looks the same is 2.5rem and the next

84
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,810
thing is, I don't think this has to be a margin,

85
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,580
this could also be a padding that we add to our main element right here.

86
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,690
Now to make things short, we can simply delete that margin top right here,

87
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,550
like that. If we now reload the page, we have the same behavior right here that we saw on the packages

88
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:23,710
page because right here, if we simply now remove the padding top right here, we can see that the main

89
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,830
element is coming directly after the navigation bar because of the margin top of 3.5rem

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,670
and that's the same behavior we have now right here.

91
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,050
We have the main element, we have the margin top of 3.5rem

92
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:46,320
and afterwards, the main element comes and now we can simply add another main selector right here,

93
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,970
this one. Now in the customers file

94
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,250
and this should not give us a margin now because you don't need the margin,

95
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:59,650
we can also use a padding top of 2.5rem, like that.

96
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:06,490
With that, we have 2.5rem for the padding and if we reload the page, we can see that our image is positioned

97
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,400
as before

98
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:14,100
but now with a different structure. Now we have a top padding of 2.5rem plus the margin top that

99
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,430
is applied generally for all our pages in the

100
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,410
shared.css file.

101
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:24,660
And with that if I click through our pages, as we can see the footer is positioned correctly right here,

102
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:32,040
it's positioned correctly right there on the packages side and on the customers

103
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,580
side.

104
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:36,500
Let's also have a look at the responsive design now,

105
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,240
this looks good, looks still good,

106
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,460
looks fine, yes

107
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,180
I think this is a nice design we have right here.

108
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,880
Let's also have a look at the packages page, at the mobile design right here,

109
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,400
this looks fine

110
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:58,260
and if we increase the size, we can see that we made a mistake because we have to add back our left and

111
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,640
right margin, this should be auto.

112
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:14,280
Remember we have to add the margin left auto and a margin right of auto, like that.

113
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:22,600
So if I now reload the page, we can see we got our responsive design back, right here and right there, this looks

114
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,440
fine.

115
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,810
So let's also have a final look at the customers page right here,

116
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,730
let's see if the responsive design works.

117
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:38,110
We have the limitation if it gets above 1500 pixels and we have a nice mobile design, the footer also works

118
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,980
perfectly.

119
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Important maybe, if we go to the customers page right here and down there to our media query, I kept

120
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:51,160
the margin of 3rem and auto for the media query because right here, it makes sense that once we go

121
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,210
to our desktop design, that we have this little gap right here,

122
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:02,360
therefore I will leave that margin as it is. And with that, we finally finished this responsive design

123
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,730
module.

124
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,860
So in the next lecture, it's time to summarize what we learned in here.
