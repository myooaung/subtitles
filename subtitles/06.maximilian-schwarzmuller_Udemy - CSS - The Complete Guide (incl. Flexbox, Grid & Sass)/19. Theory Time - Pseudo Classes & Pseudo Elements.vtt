00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.650
We actually have to differentiate between pseudo classes and pseudo elements.

2
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.630
So what does this pseudo thing mean?

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.980
Pseudo classes define a style or allow us to define a style for a special state of an element, like the

4
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:27.300
hover or active state. Pseudo elements allow us to define a style of a specific part of an element. Pseudo

5
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.720
classes are defined with a single colon and then the class name like hover or active and pseudo elements

6
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.020
are defined by adding two colons

7
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.070
and then the element name and it's about the state versus the part, that's the difference.

8
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.890
Now you can see a list of available pseudo classes on MDN, link to that can be found in the last

9
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.480
lecture of this module,

10
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.110
there you find a short introduction and then an index of standard pseudo classes.

11
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.950
Now there, you can always click on one if you want to learn more, what we got for example is of course

12
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:04.460
the

13
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.130
hover pseudo class we just used but there are also classes that allow you to select like the first

14
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.190
element of the given type, so if you have a p, a paragraph selector you can add the first of type pseudo

15
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.640
class to only select the first paragraph in a given list of paragraphs, we're talking about siblings

16
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.110
here and so on.

17
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.770
So really feel free to dive into them, to be very honest,

18
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.520
there's only a couple of them which you use and you will see them all throughout the course,

19
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.600
for example we also got focus which is helpful for styling selected input elements but it's nice to

20
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.630
dive into all of them and get a brief overview over what you can do with them.

21
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.600
Always keep in mind, they allow us to control different states or to be more precise about what we want

22
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.350
to select,

23
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.980
like with first child or first of type. A pseudo element as mentioned on the slide allows you to select

24
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.230
a specific part of an element.

25
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.910
Now here's also a short index and there are less such elements and a good example actually is the first

26
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.140
letter,

27
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.620
it allows you to simply style the first letter of an element, like for a paragraph, differently than the

28
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.600
rest which of course is great for building block pages for example,

29
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.830
you can get this newspaper style where the first letter or first line differs from the other ones.

30
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.570
So let's quickly dive into some of them including the after pseudo element which is also a pretty interesting

31
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.390
one.

32
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.130
So let's quickly explore these pseudo elements and let's say here in the paragraph we already got at

33
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.380
the bottom, we want to change it with the pseudo element first letters.

34
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.340
So we want to change that m, that first letter.

35
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.730
Now that is the only paragraph we got and we'll remove that code anyways

36
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.460
but for now, we can simply select it with paragraph and then pseudo element

37
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.890
::first-letter

38
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.270
and now we could set the color to red and the font size to 20 pixels.

39
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:20.600
If we do that and we reload our page, you can see the m is bigger and it's red. So this is the first letter,

40
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.790
now let me remove this, it was just an example.

41
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.180
Very interesting

42
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:34.340
are the after and before pseudo elements, they actually allow you to render content through CSS and

43
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:42.110
this should only be helpful content which adds to the design, not crucial page content, such content

44
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.110
should always go into HTML especially for accessibility reasons

45
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.150
but what we can do with that for example is we can mark links in an even clearer way if we wanted

46
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.990
to do that.

47
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.800
So in our example, we're selecting a link here with main-nav__item A,

48
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:08.050
now we could add another selector, main-nav__item A and then add after

49
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.080
and this now allows us to set a special property which we can only set on after and before, the content property.

50
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.340
Content takes a string

51
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.500
and this is now some content which will be added to the DOM.

52
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:29.060
Here we could for example render a link text, maybe with a whitespace in front of it so it doesn't get

53
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.100
directly attached to the old text

54
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.090
and now we can also style that content,

55
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.120
for example we could set the color to red. If we do that and we go back to our page and reload,

56
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.830
you now see all our links here

57
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.640
in the nav items array have that red link after them

58
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.840
which is part of the content which we can also click.

59
00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:00.400
So this is how we can use after and before, can be nice to render a little helper icon after a text, like

60
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.210
this, this will be opened in a new tab icon you see on some pages, stuff like that. I will also remove this

61
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.000
for now

62
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:14.080
but it's useful to know that with pseudo elements, you can control parts of an element whereas the

63
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.070
pseudo classes like hover allow you to control what you select or the state of an element.

64
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.810
That was a little dive into pseudo classes and elements,

65
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.730
now I remove the code because for now, we'll focus on hover and active which adds some real benefit to

66
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:36.280
our page, namely that we can hover or click on our links and see a different style.
