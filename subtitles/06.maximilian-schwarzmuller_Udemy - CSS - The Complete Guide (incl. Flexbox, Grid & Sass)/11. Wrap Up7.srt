1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,170
So that's it,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,600
that was it for this module.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,620
You learned about the transform property.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,800
You learned that you can use translate to move the element around on the different axis.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:19,220
You learn about scale, rotate and skew and that these functions can be applied as values on the transform

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,210
property to change the look of your element just as you need it.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,320
You learned that 3D transformations are possible via the z-axis or for the rotate

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,340
actually via the 

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,670
x and y-axis due to the way elements rotate around axis

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:43,850
and that you can use transform origin and transform style to change how your elements actually transform.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,810
You also learned about perspective,

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:52,310
very useful for 3D animations and that this allows you to define the perspective or the distance from

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,710
the object of the viewer.

14
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,080
You also learned about perspective origin which allows you to manipulate the origin of the viewer, which

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,820
means the angle at which you're looking at a transformation

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,680
and these are the key things you need to know about the transform property which can help you build

17
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,140
really powerful visual effects.
