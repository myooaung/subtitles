1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:10,100
Now that we get these basics set, let me remove all rotations but the Y rotation so that we're back to

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,000
an easier to understand 3D transformation,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,330
now we're just rotating around the y-axis

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,980
and let me add a second box.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:26,750
I'll simply duplicate that box and make sure it also is inside of the container and I'll give it a label

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,910
of animate two, the first one receives animate one

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,900
and here, I will name this box two and I'll change the selector, the class of the first one to box one.

8
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,910
In the CSS file, I'll

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,770
change that selector to box one,

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,120
then I'll duplicate the code and enter box two here.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,440
Let's give that a blue background,

12
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,010
let's keep the width and height and I'll remove transform on box two for now.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,510
Now if I save that and we reload the page,

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,030
we actually see this result.

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:02,180
Now the blue box is not inside of the container box, simply because we restrict the size of the container

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,610
box

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,300
and there already is one element with width 100%, height 100% in there.

18
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,020
Let's quickly fix that by giving this a position of relative,

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:18,510
so the container has this position and both boxes will now receive a position of absolute,

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,910
now if we reload, both are inside of that box.

21
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:29,950
Now let's also transform the blue box here by re-adding a transforme property to it

22
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:39,050
and let's give it a transform property of translateX 1rem for now. If we now save that and we then reload,

23
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,820
it simply moved to the right a bit,

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,260
just as we saw it before.

25
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,630
Now let's apply translateZ

26
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:54,110
then to also see that in effect. We use translateY and X thus far, translateZ is now the 3D transformation

27
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,680
for moving the element.

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,820
Now it can be confusing, since for rotating, we used Y and X

29
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,100
but if you keep the axis set up in mind, it makes sense that translating the element,

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,080
so moving the element on the z-axis, which is the axis coming out of the screen so to say, that moving

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,330
the element on that axis actually is the one that creates a 3D effect.

32
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:24,240
Now let's move it by let's say 10rem there, let's save that and let's reload and now you see it moved

33
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,520
towards us,

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,210
it became bigger because due to our perspective, moving an element towards us makes it bigger. On the

35
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:38,190
other hand, if we enter -10rem here and we then reload,

36
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,670
now it's moving back into that box, further away.

37
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,760
Now if we enter a way bigger value, like 100rem, -100rem and we then reload,

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,490
it's really small and it looks like it's outside of the box here

39
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,870
but actually even if I remove translateX, it stays inside of the box.

40
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,100
You can just think of that box as extending as a 3D space into

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,500
that 3D area behind it,

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,700
so it's actually moved further into the box so to say

43
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:15,040
and since we have a perspective coming from the right, we look at this from the right side.

44
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:21,090
This should become clearer if I reset my perspective origin to center for now,

45
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:27,940
if I then reload the page, now you can see it's still in the box, just moved further into the back.

46
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:35,500
It doesn't actually go behind our red box simply because the Z-index still applies when it comes to

47
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,370
how these elements stack,

48
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,730
they don't actually intersect.

49
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,780
Now, let me change that perspective back to 500pixel again and let me now show you something interesting

50
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,910
in the next lecture.

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,840
What happens if we also transform the container?
