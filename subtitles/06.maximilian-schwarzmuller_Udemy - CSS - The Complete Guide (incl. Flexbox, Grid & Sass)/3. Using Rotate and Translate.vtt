00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.310
In the last lecture, we rotated our element. We did this rotateZ and transform origin helps us

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.540
to define around which point we want to rotate.

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.730
Now we also want to move the element and of course we can do this with top and right,

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.210
it's an absolute element.

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.820
If we set top to let's say 1rem here, we move it down by 1rem,

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.290
therefore it went down a little bit.

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.660
Now nothing wrong with using top and right,

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.880
however if the element wasn't positioned absolute but instead statically like a normal element, we couldn't

9
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.870
use that,

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.960
we could then use the margin to kind of move it in a hacky way or set the position to relative to use

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.150
top and right again

12
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.970
but there actually is a better way if you really just want to move it for some visual effects and that

13
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.230
is the translate property or the translate function to be precise on the transform property.

14
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.460
There, you also get a couple of different values and we'll focus on x and y for now, translateZ will

15
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.010
become important for 3D transformations and translateX allows you to move the element on the x-axis.

16
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.480
Here you can enter rem, pixel, em or percentages,

17
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.260
so any normal units and it will move the element to the right by the value you enter here.

18
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.210
So if I enter 1rem here, if I now reload, the element moves to the right a little bit, this becomes

19
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.090
even clearer if I enter a higher value like 10rem here. If we entered 10rem into translateX,

20
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.230
now it's moved quite a bit to the right.

21
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.640
It also moved down a bit and that's happening because we rotated the element,

22
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.740
so it's moving diagonally.

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.450
You have to think of translateX as working on the x-axis which goes through the center of this box.

24
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.010
So right now, the x-axis isn't a normal horizontal line,

25
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.080
it's a diagonal from the top left to bottom right so to say. If we remove the rotation, we would have

26
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.160
a horizontal x-axis again.

27
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.640
So this is important to keep in mind for understanding how translateX works if you also apply

28
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.110
a rotation.

29
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.320
Now I don't want to move it by 10rem anyways,

30
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.010
I want to move it by 1 and I also want to move it on the y-axis maybe, so

31
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.600
let's add translateY

32
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.600
here,

33
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.590
also 1rem and

34
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.280
let's see where we end up then.

35
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.070
If we enter this, it looks like that.

36
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.650
Now one thing I want to change before I continue moving it around,

37
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.100
I want to increase the width of that element,

38
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.050
I want to increase the width so that we can center the text and get some excess space to the left and

39
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.920
to the right which we can actually cut off once it's positioned correctly

40
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.320
and once that extra space goes beyond the boundaries of that package box. The reason for this is that

41
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.640
once we cut it off, it'll look like a really nice badge on this box.

42
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.030
So for this, not related to transformations but useful here, I'll set a width of

43
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.940
12rem and add text align center to that badge. With that in place, if I save and reload this,

44
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.190
now this is our badge

45
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.780
and now we can try to position it in the way we want to position it.

46
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.500
So for that, I'll go back to translateX and translateY

47
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.030
and let's actually try a negative value for translateY and 2rem for translateX.

48
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.630
Now this is getting closer to where I want it,

49
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.690
now maybe we need 3rem for translateX to move it a bit further down to the right,

50
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.070
this is looking almost perfect, 3.5 should do the trick I believe

51
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.910
and now with that, we want to cut it off which we can do, non-transformation related, by simply going to

52
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.690
our package element,

53
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.250
so to the package selector and by adding overflow

54
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.050
hidden there,

55
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.600
this will make sure that any elements that go beyond the boundaries of the package box will be cropped.

56
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.820
So now if we reload, we've got this really nice badge sitting in the top right corner

57
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.700
and that is mainly achieved with transformations,

58
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.420
so with rotating the element and with moving it and again, why are we moving it with translate instead

59
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.010
of top and right?

60
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.070
You could use top and right, translateX and Y also get hardware acceleration though and therefore, are

61
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.970
a good tool if you just want to visually reposition the element,

62
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.340
so it's in general a good tool for that final finetuning to fit the element into the position you want

63
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.090
to fit it to,

64
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.130
especially when you're also working with other transformations like rotate.

65
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.070
So with that, we got our badge finished and we learned about the basic transformations with rotate

66
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.180
and translateX and Y.

67
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.880
Important to keep in mind,

68
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:43.820
translateX and Y, the axis changes when we rotate the element, the axis always goes through the center of

69
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.920
that badge, at least if transform origin is set to center. With that out of the way,

70
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.160
let's dive into two other transform functions we can use in the next lecture.
