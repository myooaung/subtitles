00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.420
Now we had a look at the positioning of the grid elements,

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.130
sometimes you also want to position the entire grid and with that, I don't mean to container, you can

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.590
of course position that differently for example by using position absolute and moving it somewhere, by

4
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.330
putting it into a flexbox, by putting it into another grid, this is also possible.

5
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.810
But I mean that the grid might have a certain height which is not filled by all its rows and columns,

6
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.720
so height and width actually which is not filled.

7
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.020
Let me demonstrate this.

8
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.110
I'll add a width of 500 pixels here and now

9
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.820
let's remove all the auto assignments,

10
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.600
let's also shrink the column sizes to 20%, so that it doesn't add up to 100,

11
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.820
so there will be some empty space

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.530
and on this row value here, we're not going to use auto but the maximum value for that row let's say is actually

13
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.930
20rem.

14
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.000
Now with that all set, let's maybe increase that a bit more to 800 height and width, let's save that and

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.740
reload

16
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.910
and now we got a grid container as you can see which is bigger than its content.

17
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.830
Now the question is, where do you want to position the entire content?

18
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.870
So I don't mean the elements in their tracks or in their areas,

19
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.290
I mean the entire grid content. Now for this, you get two additional properties

20
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.020
and the first one is justify content, this positions the entire grid on the x-axis,

21
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.200
you can put this or set this to center for example. If you reload,

22
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.260
you see the grid is now is centered in the container area.

23
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.840
You also have start which is the default as you saw and end which unsurprisingly moves it to the end of

24
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.630
its container area.

25
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.440
You also can assign stretch here, which actually leads to the same result as start though.

26
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.070
So this does not stretch the values because it doesn't overwrite the row and column sizes you

27
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.470
defined in your template settings here.

28
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.490
Now this is the positioning along the x-axis,

29
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.120
let's maybe set this back to center.

30
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.110
Now we can also position it on the y-axis of course

31
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.420
and for this, we got align content.

32
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.830
So you probably see a pattern, justify at the beginning means x-axis or within a row, align at the beginning

33
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.220
means y-axis or along the columns

34
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.060
and here of course you've got the usual suspects. You can set align content to center and if you do

35
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.190
that and you reload,

36
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.840
now the grid is centered vertically in its container

37
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.420
and of course you also got start and end as alternatives. So start is basically the default you started

38
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.960
with and end will move it to the end of its container.

39
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.360
Now this can be highly useful in cases where you simply have a grid which might not necessarily fill

40
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.140
the entire space you reserved for it and where you want to ensure that it's still positioned in a certain

41
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.940
way within that container.

42
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.870
So justify content and align content are your friends then.
