00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:08,170
I'm liking the shape of our application, we're really making good progress.

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,610
What I'd also like is a little bit of a different style if we hover over these links.

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:21,000
It would be nice if they by default, not only if we hover over them, would be bold, well that's easy to

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,510
achieve of course but if they also had like a border at the bottom. We could re-add text decoration but

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,210
that underlining was very close to the text,

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,390
I'd like a real border with some padding in between.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,410
Now let's start with the bold part, that's easy,

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,130
we can simply add font weight

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,160
bold to our nav item.

10
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,380
If we go back and reload, it's bold unsurprisingly.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,840
Now regarding the underlining, that is something I want to do with a border. Now for that, we can add

12
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,250
border-bottom,

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,740
this is another shorthand which only styles the bottom border and there we can for example set this

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,570
to 5 pixels solid and white.

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,950
If we save that and we reload the page, we always got that,

16
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,470
I of course only want it if I hover over it,

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,150
so let's copy it to that style,

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:12,870
excuse me,

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,170
so only to the hover and active style.

20
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,620
If we now reload,

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,530
we got it if I hover over it but it's still very close,

22
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,350
I want to have some padding in between.

23
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,510
So let's go back and let's add a padding to the anchor tag,

24
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,920
not only when we're hovering over it but always

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,230
otherwise we'll see some ugly jumping.

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,980
So here, we can add a padding into all directions or just top and bottom, whatever you want, 

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,710
let's say top and bottom of three pixels,

28
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,390
so zero to left and right.

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,100
If we now go back, that did work just fine.

30
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,920
Now the last thing I want to add for this navigation, this start hosting button here or link should actually

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,880
look a bit different,

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,240
it should be our call to action link,

33
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,520
so it should really stand out from the rest and have a different styling. Now let's style that in the next lecture.
