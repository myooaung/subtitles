1
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.850
So what is this behavior I was referring to?

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.690
Well basically, we have the same situation that we had for the third rule.

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:19.490
So we have our element with the position static or position relative declaration and that's important,

4
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.980
we have the height property, that's important,

5
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.540
the height property applied with a percentage unit. This means that the percentage value depends on the

6
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.580
containing block which is the closest ancestor which is a block level element,

7
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.930
so that's a situation we have. In contrast to the starting situation we had right there,

8
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:48.830
the ancestor now also has to be an element with position static or position relative applied,

9
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.300
that's important.

10
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.280
So with this starting scenario, we can now go back to our website and add some code to see why this

11
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.010
scenario can lead to an,

12
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.870
well at least unexpected behavior.

13
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.690
So back on our customers page, I would like to add a new element, this element will be a so-called backdrop.

14
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.500
The backdrop has the purpose to cover the entire website, so it should be on top of all the other elements

15
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.460
we have because we will soon, in the next module to be more precise,

16
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.980
add a pop-up window you could say which should be on top

17
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.290
once you click a button. Below that pop-up, we want to have this backdrop, this slightly transparent backdrop

18
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.970
and behind that backdrop,

19
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.610
all the rest of the website should be located.

20
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.990
We'll dive deeper into this pop-up and how to create it in the next module

21
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.560
as I said, the important thing for now is that we need to create a new element which has a width of 100%

22
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.340
and a height of 100%. To do that,

23
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.450
we go to our code, specifically to the index.html

24
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.040
file right here in the customers folder

25
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.140
and then we go below our body opening tag right here

26
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.120
and add a div, no content in this div, it only has the class backdrop because that's what it's going to

27
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.110
be.

28
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.310
Don't forget to save that and as we will need this backdrop in all our HTML files, we now have to go

29
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.850
to the shared.css file,

30
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:29.110
right here. In there, we add this selector, this backdrop selector below our body selector and I'll do this

31
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.780
now, so select the backdrop class and now I will add a position property to this selector.

32
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.930
Why am I doing this?

33
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.680
Well as I said, the as I called it, the unexpected behavior only occurs if our element has positioned static

34
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.380
or relative applied.

35
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.120
Now to be honest, we will create that backdrop in the end with position fixed because that's normally

36
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.140
the way you do it,

37
00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.830
so what I'em showing you right here is just a temporary solution, with the goal to show you this behavior

38
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.900
I was talking about but this solution will be changed soon,

39
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.520
just keep that in mind.

40
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.890
Nevertheless, I will now apply position relative because as I said, the backdrop should be on top of the

41
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.190
other elements and position static will not allow us to add a set index which we can do with position

42
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.310
relative,

43
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:29.580
so let's add a set index of 100 maybe and then we need a width of 100% and also a height

44
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.900
of 100%

45
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.760
because the backdrop should cover the enter a page and then some background color,

46
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.490
maybe rgba let's say 0, 0, 0 and 0.5,

47
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.890
this is basically black with a slight transparency,

48
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.780
so as I said so that you can see the other elements below

49
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.620
but you can see that the focus now is on that pop-up above the backdrop.

50
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.710
And with that if we save that and go back to the page and reload it, we cannot see a thing right here

51
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.390
and that's probably unexpected.

52
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.670
Now let's inspect that and see what happened.

53
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.130
We can see that we have our backdrop right here below our body element,

54
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.510
so this is working

55
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:25.070
and as we applied position relative, the containing block should be the closest ancestor which is

56
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.730
a block level element and undoubtably, our body element is a block level element,

57
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.600
so this should be the ancestor.

58
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:42.510
Now this body element has a width of almost 940 pixels and a height of 993 pixels,

59
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.100
let's see what happened to our backdrop right here.

60
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:53.170
Well as we can see, the width was overtaken from the containing block, this worked fine with the 100%

61
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.530
but the height was not overtaken and that's the interesting thing, right?

62
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:05.400
Apparently we were able to get the width but not the height. Now what caused this issue?

63
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.220
If we inspect that, we can see that the height is not defined right here

64
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.420
and while for the width this is not a big problem because it can use the value it finds right here, for

65
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.280
the height

66
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.020
this doesn't work because the height is only defined by the content of our body right here

67
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:31.170
but this information does not suffice to make this height 100% declaration work in our case.

68
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.960
Now we have multiple ways to solve this issue

69
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.770
and we'll also dive into another approach throughout this module

70
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.250
but if we want to solve this with percentages only, the following way is one easy workaround to make

71
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.530
sure that we can use this height 100% way. For that,

72
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.630
we have to go back to our shared.css file right here and now add the HTML selector,

73
00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.870
this one. Here we add height 100%, like that

74
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.080
and now we also add this height declaration right here to our body element because what will work then

75
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:16.430
is if we go back and reload the page, we can see that the backdrop is working apparently, it moved down the

76
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.740
other elements below it because it's relatively positioned, so it stays in the document flow

77
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.700
and the backdrop also doesn't cover the elements down here,

78
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.640
we'll dive into the reasons for that in a few seconds

79
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.440
but the interesting thing is that now we added the 100% height to the HTML element right here,

80
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.530
to the body right there

81
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:45.200
and with this declaration right here, we are now also able to make this height value right here

82
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.310
to 2 which is basically the same one that we have in the body, to make this work.

83
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.360
So this is this quick workaround 

84
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.800
I wanted to show you. Regarding the issue we have right now

85
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.560
that basically this element is above the others,

86
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.450
well this can be solved easily of course. What we can do is we can simply go back to our backdrop and

87
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.770
now change the position value from relative to absolute

88
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.170
for example. If we do that, we don't need that trick as I would call it,

89
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:25.310
so we can get rid of these height declarations right here and if we now reload the page, you can see that the

90
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.910
backdrop is working,

91
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.280
this is fine,

92
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.720
there are two problems though.

93
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:35.060
The first problem is that if we scroll down, well it still doesn't stick to the viewport

94
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.430
and the second problem is this gap up here.

95
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:47.840
So regarding this gap up here, this is simply due to margin collapsing because if we go into our main

96
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:54.170
element, into the div and now open or click onto the testimonial class, we can see that we added

97
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.510
a margin to it, right here a margin top and this margin

98
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:06.340
and if we unselect this and the other margin, then we can see that the backdrop covers the entire page.

99
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:13.160
This is a typical case of margin collapsing, a concept Max already explained to you and therefore you

100
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:19.430
can see what you learn in this course really happens when you create your websites. However, we have

101
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.820
to activate that for the moment because we won't remove that margins

102
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:30.530
and before we talk about this issue down here, I want to think about the reason why this is working now

103
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:38.570
actually, because as you saw, I remove these 100% height declarations and nevertheless, the backdrop

104
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.630
generally works,

105
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.140
besides that margin collapsing stuff.

106
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.580
The reason for that is that if we use position absolute for our element, then the conditional block would

107
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.770
be the closest ancestor which has a position property different from static applied.

108
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:59.980
That's not the case for us because the body in our HTML have the position property applied

109
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:06.610
and if that's the case, so if you don't have such a position property for the ancestors, then the position

110
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.320
absolute declaration leads to the same behavior as position fixed,

111
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:17.170
this means the percentage value refers to the viewport as the containing block.

112
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.180
That's a reason why this is working right here.

113
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:24.610
Nevertheless if we scroll down, we can see that it of course doesn't stick to the viewport,

114
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:31.000
it just takes the height and width, the percentage value is based on a viewport but it behaves like

115
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.870
a normal absolutely positioned element.

116
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:40.060
Therefore if we now change position absolute to position fixed right here and reload the page, we can

117
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.410
see that our backdrop is basically working,

118
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.800
we still have this margin collapsing issue though, this issue can be fixed quickly though.

119
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:57.970
If we now just add top zero and left zero right here as two new properties and now reload our page,

120
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:03.070
we can see that our backdrop is working perfectly.

121
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:10.660
And with that, we added this backdrop and in one of the later lectures of this module, I will show you

122
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:18.460
another unit which also allows us to solve this in an alternative way because we will use the the vh

123
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:25.240
and vw unit which refers to the viewport, which will basically lead to the same result but with a different

124
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.300
solution

125
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.010
but generally, our viewport is working fine now.

126
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:36.730
The only problem is that we don't have the viewport on all of our pages because it should also be on

127
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.220
the starting page

128
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:45.790
and on the packages page and the other issue is that we cannot click around anymore because our backdrop

129
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.880
is now, well basically on top of all the other elements.

130
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:58.010
So let's first add maybe display none right here to make it disappear

131
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.290
and if we now reload, we can again click onto our website

132
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.290
and now we just have to add the element, so right here,

133
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:10.660
our div class backdrop to our index.html

134
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.600
file in the packages folder right here,

135
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:25.030
like that and in the main index.html file, also reload the body right here, like that.

136
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:32.590
Now let's save all that and with that, we saw how we can fix this strange behavior with height

137
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.260
100%

138
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.440
and we also saw one way, how to quickly add such a backdrop.

139
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:43.960
It's not the final version yet though because as I said, we will learn how to use a different approach

140
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:50.620
and of course we also have to add some Javascript because if the only way to make this backdrop appear

141
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.620
and disappear is adding display none or not, well not the best way probably.

142
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.920
But with that, we have a good status now and we can continue in our module.
