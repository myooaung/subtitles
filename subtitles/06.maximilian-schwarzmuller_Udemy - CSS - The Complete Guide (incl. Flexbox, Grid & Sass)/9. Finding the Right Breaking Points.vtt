00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:09.580
There is one last important thing that I would like you to keep in mind and this thing is how

2
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.060
can we specify these breaking points?

3
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.830
We have the 40rem right here,

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.350
so the 640 pixels but I just applied that because of course, we prepared the project and we know that

5
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.160
this works fine for us

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.940
but normally when you build your website, you need kind of an idea of where this breaking points could be.

7
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.190
You can of course play around and have a look at your design but you might want to target specific

8
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.820
devices and make sure that you have logical breaking points to ensure that your website looks good on

9
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.760
as many devices as possible and without having to add like 10 media queries right here.

10
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.710
So one idea how to do this is if you go again to mydevice.io for example and go to compare devices,

11
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.270
then you can select smartphones or tablets up here

12
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.520
and with that, you can get a really quick overview of the width and height, important choose the CSS

13
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.930
width and height right here, of the width and height of the most common devices,

14
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.730
for example though we have an iPad right here,

15
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.420
we have a Galaxy tab and then you can see that for example,

16
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.880
768 of width,

17
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.620
that's of course in portrait mode because we would normally build our websites

18
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.320
for the portrait mode, on tablets would be a good approximation or a good starting point for a

19
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.290
breaking point that you could set because then you could make sure that you optimize your mobile design

20
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.110
for if you look at the smartphone

21
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.720
width right

22
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.870
here, we can see that the most modern smartphones have a width of more than 300 pixels.

23
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.190
So basically, if your website looks good for widths between 300 pixels and 768

24
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.640
pixels, you would ensure that you have a nice looking website for most mobile phones and

25
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.060
then you could set your first breaking point at 768 pixels and then maybe make another

26
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.900
breaking point at 1000 pixels for example,

27
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.550
for really big screens then. That's how you could approach that and you could easily set your breaking

28
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.300
points in a logical way.

29
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:24.230
One additional thing I would like you to keep in mind though is that the way you add your media queries right here

30
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.530
is not the correct one to be honest.

31
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.490
It's totally fine to add the media queries below the actual rule you have for the corresponding selectors

32
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.640
but in the end and we will also do this in this course, once we finish our media queries, you would simply

33
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.940
take them and paste them right here at the bottom of your code, like that

34
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.790
because with that, other developers can easily find all your media queries and change them if necessary

35
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.850
and this helps us to keep our code more structured.

36
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.320
However for the purpose of this module now, we will add the media queries below

37
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.120
their actual rule right here as we did it so far because it makes it easier for us to understand which

38
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:21.110
elements we are referring to and what properties we want to change. Now with that, we set all the basics

39
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.080
for our media queries, so in the next videos,

40
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.370
we can now continue working on our website because so far, the image looks fine and the slogan I think

41
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.470
is ok but our mobile view for our plans,

42
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.360
I don't think this looks good. So let's see how we can improve this by adding media queries in the next

43
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.980
lecture.
