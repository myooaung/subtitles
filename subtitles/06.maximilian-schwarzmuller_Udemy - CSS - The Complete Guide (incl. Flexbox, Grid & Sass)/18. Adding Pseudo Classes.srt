We're making good progress, our links do look better

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,850
but wouldn't it be nice if they changed their style if we hover over them or if we keep clicking on

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:17,280
them, so if we hold the mouse button which is like a touch event on a mobile phone? That would be great

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,400
and of course we can style that too with CSS, we use so-called pseudo classes for that.

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,390
Now how does this work?

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,840
Let me show you what it is and then I'll explain how it works.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:36,700
We again add our selector, main-nav__item a just as before but now we add a pseudo class to the anchor

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,970
tag selector.

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,670
We do this by adding a colon directly after it,

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,470
so there is no whitespace in between because that would just be another descendant combinator and

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,340
would select elements over which we hover which are nested inside an anchor tag,

12
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:55,540
we want to fetch to hover on the anchor tag. The colon alone doesn't listen to hover though but colon

13
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,770
hover is just one of many pseudo classes we can attach,

14
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,560
another one would be the active one,

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,350
so let's quickly copy that and create a second rule and assign the active pseudo class here.

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,910
Now we can assign our rules

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,650
and for example, we could say that upon hovering, we want to have a white color and we want to have the

18
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,770
same style for the active click,

19
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:29,180
so once we hold the mouse pressed. If we save that and reload, we can hover over these

20
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,710
and now the color changes and it also keeps changing or keeps changed

21
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,950
if I hold my mouse button.

22
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,920
So this is how we can use such a pseudo class, now which other psuedo classes do exist

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,380
and what exactly does this pseudo thing mean?
