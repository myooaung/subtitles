00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:07,280
So what's the next property we can use in connection with the flex items?

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:14,030
Well this property is close to a property we already used so far on the flex container,

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,290
now let me show you the property. For that,

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:19,460
I will now add it right here to our third item,

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,330
so this is basically this orange box right here,

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:32,150
this one. If we now add align but not align content or align items but align self,

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,450
this one right here,

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,700
then we can again use values we already know,

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:45,650
for example flex start. If we do that, go back and relod the page, you can see that the element is, that's

10
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,130
important, positioned in relation to the cross axis.

11
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,040
So the cross axis, right here we have flex direction row and by the way, that's also the reason why

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,390
I repeat telling you the main axis and cross axis topics because as you can see, it's really important

13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,280
to understand and to work with both the flex container and the flex items.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,850
However, we have flex direction row right here,

15
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:16,700
so our cross axis starts in the upper left corner and goes to the lower left corner, therefore flex start

16
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:24,080
will pin the item right here. If we will change align self to flex end, not like that, maybe written

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,340
correctly like this and reload the page again,

18
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,220
it will be at the end.

19
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:35,870
The important thing though and the difference in contrast to align items is that align items of course

20
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,960
referred to all elements,

21
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:46,100
that's the difference but align self allows us to define the position of a single element which is part

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,810
of a flex container

23
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:54,950
of course. As always, I will not dive into all values we have for this align self property just because

24
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:01,040
again, I think that understanding the core concept is more important than trying out all the values

25
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:06,710
but if you have a look at the MDN right here, you can see which values we can apply.

26
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,260
We for example tried flex start and flex end now, we talked about baseline already when we had a look

27
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,320
at the flex container.

28
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,550
So feel free to play around right here

29
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:23,520
but basically this is how align self works for elements which are flex items inside our flex container.

30
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,040
So these were the first two properties I wanted to show you,

31
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:34,280
so we have order and we have align self which always aligns a single flex item along the cross axis

32
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,790
and now we have three more properties left.

33
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,680
Now let me show you the first property, flex grow, in the next lecture.
