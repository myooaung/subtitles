00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,610
Welcome to this module.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,760
So we added Javascript to our project,

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:13,490
now it's time to dive into responsive design because until now, we are working on our website,

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,340
we are adding style to it and the look improves more and more

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,920
but the problem is that we are only focusing onto the desktop version of it. Nowadays

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,660
a lot of users will visit your website from mobile devices.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,930
Therefore it is really important to ensure that our website looks awesome on both, mobile devices and

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:43,060
desktop devices and to achieve this, we need to implement a responsive design. As the name already indicates,

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,340
a design which adapts to the device

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,910
our website visitors are using.

11
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:56,320
So in this module, we will have a look at the difference between hardware and software pixels because

12
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:03,280
there is an important core concept behind it which we need to understand to ensure that our website

13
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:12,830
scales correctly to a desktop or a mobile device. We'll also have a look at the viewport meta tag in HTML.

14
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:20,260
Well, this is a CSS course but this is a really important meta tag we have to add and understand to

15
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,620
be able to create such a responsive design,

16
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,030
therefore we'll have a closer look at that

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:33,670
and finally, we'll have a look at media queries and how we can add them to our code with @media. And

18
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:40,140
with the combination of these tools and these concepts, we should be able to turn our nice desktop web

19
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,480
website into a really cool responsive website.
