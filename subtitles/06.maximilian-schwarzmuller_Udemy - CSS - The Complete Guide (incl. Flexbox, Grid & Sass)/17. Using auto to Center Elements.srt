00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,730
So how can we easily center our elements?

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,750
Well to be honest, we already applied this value

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,180
I want to show you right now,

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,750
that's why it's just a quick tip

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:19,480
but I want to make sure that we also saw this as part of this unit's module. The value I'm talking about

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:28,540
is the one we for example used here in our plan list because as you can see, the elements are centered

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:36,670
and the reason why this works is that if we go to our main.css file and then go down to plan list,

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,400
it's this one right here,

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,220
margin

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:39,910
auto

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:49,560
because if I would comment that out now just for testing purposes, like that and reload the page, you can

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,130
see that the items are obviously not centered.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,800
Now you could play around and define a margin left right of X percent and with that, center your element

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,910
but with margin auto, this is automatically done by the browser basically

15
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:14,760
and as we can see with that, we easily can center our elements perfectly and make our lives a bit easier.

16
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,390
Now margin auto is not always the perfect solution of course but I just want you to keep that in mind in

17
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,790
case you have issues like that.

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,230
So we now also got this in our minds,

19
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,990
so in the next lecture, it's time to have a last look at our code in this module and see if we have to

20
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,300
clean up our code a bit and maybe adjust some values to one of the units

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,440
we just learned about.
