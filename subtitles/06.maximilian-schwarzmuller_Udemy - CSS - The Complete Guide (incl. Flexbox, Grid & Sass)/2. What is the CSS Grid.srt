So what is the CSS grid? Let's consider a normal web page like this one, where we have a couple of different

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,220
elements or areas. We may have a header, sidebar,

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:22,520
the main content with some elements and a footer let's say. Now if we look close, we could divide this

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,790
up into a grid of rows and columns, so like this

5
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:34,310
and of course we have more than one row and one column. We could think of this page being structured

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:41,810
along this grid and actually, this is how you work in many design tools like sketch and so on where

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:49,700
you can also use a grid to position elements or when you work with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap,

8
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:56,240
they also always ship with a grid which makes the positioning of elements easier because positioning

9
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:04,910
elements on the page in the place where you want them to have is one of the most difficult or complex features

10
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:11,250
you have in CSS and the CSS grid is another tool which aims to help you with that.

11
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:17,270
It allows you to define such a grid of rows and columns and to then specify which element should be

12
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,560
positioned where and it's really flexible about all of that as you will learn,

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,180
so let's dive into it and let's start creating a simple grid.
