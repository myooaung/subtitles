00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.440
Now that we had a look at the box model,

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.140
we also implicitly got a first glimpse at shorthand properties, to be very precise,

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.640
we already use shorthand properties since we first started using background. Shorthand properties are

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.370
simply normal properties that combine the values of multiple other properties in a single property,

5
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.170
the so-called shorthand property, here are some examples.

6
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.500
We get some separate properties let's say, border width, style and color.

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.220
This is what we already saw and style is either dashed or solid let's say.

8
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.390
Now of course there are other ways to like dotted,

9
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.400
you can always find all available options in the reference, in the MDN reference for that property

10
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.680
but these are the individual properties that allow you to construct a border. If you only set two of

11
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.110
them and omit one,

12
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.880
the default for that property will be used which could lead to no border being displayed or the border

13
00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.580
being solid

14
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.660
even though you want it to be dashed, well if you don't specify that, the default will be used.

15
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.490
There is a shorthand for this because it's of course a bit more cumbersome to always define a border

16
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.160
like this,

17
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.620
border width, style, color,

18
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.360
that's a lot to type.

19
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.790
Therefore we got shorthands and the shorthand for border would look like this,

20
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.430
it's just called border and then we simply assign the values for the different subproperties so to

21
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.990
say. Now order here doesn't matter as long as the subproperties don't use the same type of value which isn't

22
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.560
the case for border, for other shorthands,

23
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.330
it will be the case and I will highlight this and tell you how to circumvent this once it is the case.

24
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.560
So for border, we could mix the order of the arguments here, of the values in whichever way we want, the

25
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.890
core is that

26
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.860
this will be interpreted in exactly the same way as it is on the left.

27
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.880
Another example would be margin,

28
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.770
we didn't even use that notation until now,

29
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.360
we use the one where we just had margin colon and then 20 pixels.

30
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.200
Now actually the margin has a couple of shorthands,

31
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.720
it's always just margin but you could write it like this

32
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.840
and this would read as top, right, bottom and left,

33
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.120
so this is a shorter way of setting the margins for different directions.

34
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.990
If you want to set the top and bottom and left and right to the same,

35
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.540
you could use this notation,

36
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.310
the first value is then set for the top and bottom margin,

37
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.020
the second one for left and right and if you want to use the same margin on all sides as we did it, then

38
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.810
you would use margin with one value,

39
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.330
now this will be applied to all sides.

40
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.190
These are shorthand properties,

41
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.360
we use a lot of shorthands in CSS and I will always mention them once we use one or once we can use

42
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.940
one.

43
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.290
Again we already did it for background,

44
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.000
I'll dive deeper into what background covers or which other values are part of background 

45
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.180
later in the course once we also add background images. It's important that you should use shorthands

46
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.520
if you have the chance to do so, simply because it's cleaner and shorter code

47
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.450
but you can always use the longer version and what you can also do is you can define a shorthand version

48
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.720
and later let's say in another class with a higher specificity, you could overwrite one part of that

49
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.720
if you for example want to keep the border color and only change the width, you'd define the border shorthand

50
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.070
first and then in the overwriting rule,

51
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.730
you'd just define the border width, it will still take the old set up from the shorthand and then only overwrite

52
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.280
that single part of it.

53
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.530
So that's also a nice way of working with shorthands

54
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.220
but again, this will all be something we see in the course.
