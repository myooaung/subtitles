00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.150
So how was it,

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.040
are you a rem lover right now?

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.760
In case you had some problems,

4
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.780
let's have a look at it together now.

5
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.310
Now as I said for the padding top, we can simply change that 32 pixels into 2rem,

6
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.380
so 2 times 16 pixels,

7
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.720
then we have our width and height with

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.980
100%,

9
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.210
this is totally fine,

10
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.560
Max guided you through that.

11
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.840
Here we have the margin which we can definitely change to 1rem also,

12
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.530
we know how this works now.

13
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:39.180
I also told you that I will keep the border as pixels as I don't want to have this really huge borders

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.870
if we have a larger default font size, you can apply rem here if you want to,

15
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.160
as I said, not my preference

16
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.080
therefore we'll leave it like that.

17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.820
Same thing is true for the box shadow

18
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.220
right here, we'll also stick to pixels. For the package,

19
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.650
a) we have our padding of 32 pixels,

20
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.030
so again something we should change right here to rem.

21
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.470
Regarding our margin for our batch, so for this thing right here, this recommended batch,

22
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.200
well let's also add rem right here maybe, I think this is totally fine,

23
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.070
let's say 1.2rem like that, let's see what this looks like,

24
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.130
I think this is OK,

25
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.900
then we have a padding of 8 pixels which should be 0.5rem, like that

26
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.370
and then we have package info,

27
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.960
so I think you know how it works so we can do it a bit faster now,

28
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.690
1rem. The border will remain the way it is,

29
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.480
we will change the font size to 1.2rem right here,

30
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.180
like that and then we are actually done as I think, we have the border,

31
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.930
yes that's it actually.

32
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.120
So with that, we also fix this package page right here 

33
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.870
and this is also totally dynamic now, so no more pixels in here

34
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.330
and as we have to repeat the same procedure for shared and the main.css file,

35
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.880
I will now simply jump to the stage where I applied all these changes.

36
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.730
You can find the code after adding these changes attached to this video,

37
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:23.970
so simply change the CSS code of the shared and the main.css file and after I added these changes, I'll be

38
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.470
back.

39
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.420
So with that finished as I said, just copy the code you can find attached to the video into the shared.css

40
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.930
and the main.css file

41
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.540
and if we now look at our website, it looks all right,

42
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.920
so nothing broke apparently

43
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.440
and if we increase the font size to very large right now,

44
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.050
let's see what happens, like this and like that,

45
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.650
then we can see that the starting page looks OK,

46
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.850
no big issues.

47
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.640
We have the packages side which looks all right actually

48
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.880
and we have our customer side which also looks OK.

49
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.790
So our rem update turned out to work fine,

50
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.410
our page gets looking better and better.

51
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.090
Let me just guide you through two or three or some things that I changed or that I did not change.

52
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.460
For example in the shared.css file,

53
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.750
you can see that I didn't change this calculation so far,

54
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.530
we might work on that later but not as of now

55
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:31.510
and you can also see that I left the border radius to a pixel value. It's again the same rationale I

56
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:40.150
talked about when we left the box shadow or the border in general as a pixel value. The rest is actually

57
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.660
straightforward as we did it all the time,

58
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.310
here again another border radius. And in the main.css file, I deleted the padding we had right here

59
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.530
in our product overview ID selector,

60
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.110
that was a padding of 10 pixels,

61
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.730
I don't think we need that anymore,

62
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.650
that's why I got rid of it.

63
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.460
Another thing that I left in pixels is down here,

64
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.550
our key feature image, these are these images we have down here to see how awesome our page is.

65
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.310
We will work on these later also in the responsive part,

66
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.090
therefore I didn't change the units of these images as of now

67
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.770
but generally for the majority of our website right here, the rem unit is now applied.

68
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:34.000
So with rem and em being finished and applied, we can now continue with the last unit that I would like to

69
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.020
show you as part of this module. For that,

70
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.980
do you remember this backdrop right here, that we added to our HTML files?

71
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.470
We commented it out so far with the display none declaration right here,

72
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.180
so let me maybe add it once again so that you can see it.

73
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.280
So it works totally fine,

74
00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:01.090
we don't have any problems with it but I told you that there is a second approach, how to create such

75
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.140
a backdrop,

76
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.410
mainly because we refer to the viewport with the position fixed property

77
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.700
and I said to you that this is one way, how to do this but we have another unit which makes it also

78
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.500
easy for us to create such backdrops for example.

79
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.390
Let's have a look at this unit in the next lecture.
