00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,160
So over the last modules, we built this page.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,530
It's not finished yet,

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:13,240
we can improve the look of that background image, we can center it and so on, we can maybe position that

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,830
text differently,

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:21,250
we can in general work with units a bit more, use better units than pixels, we'll do that.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:28,840
We can add images here and the positioning with inline block has some issues, that hacky approach we used

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:38,050
in the navigation bar where we had to calculate the width of our navigation here by deducting an estimated

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:38,530
amount

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,160
basically, we can improve that.

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,080
The fact that here, these boxes on the left and right don't align,

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:54,220
these are all things we will fix especially once we dive into flex box, a cool way of layouting elements

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:00,160
you could say, of positioning elements but the general look is great and you learned many basics with

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,220
that and you practiced many basics now.

14
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:11,350
The next step still in this same module will be to add a second page, the packages page. We'll add the

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:18,130
same navigation and footer to the page and then we'll add some HTML code to that page and I will show

16
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,750
you and explain what it should look like in the end

17
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:27,880
and then it's your turn to practice that and try to style it with tools you learned so that you achieve

18
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,190
that style

19
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,170
I want to see at the end.

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,360
So these are the next step,

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:42,610
adding that new page, setting the header and the bottom, the footer there and then adding content to it which

22
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,380
you can style.
