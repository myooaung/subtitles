00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,120
So what are lists and maps?

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:11,510
Well, let me introduce you to this. A list simply is a variable that holds more than one value,

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,210
a typical example would be something like the box shadow here,

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,800
this is a list of values,

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,710
it's not just one value, it's a list of values

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,820
and of course we could store each value individually in a variable and then construct this from multiple

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,690
variables

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,360
but it's easier if we just store this.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,360
So here we're not actually reusing the box shadow,

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,980
maybe we find another example where we are reusing it.

11
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:44,310
An example would be the border, this border definition with 0.05rem solid and the main color, we use

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,770
that twice.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,500
So let's grab that value here and create a new variable which I'll name border default

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,630
and now I just put the value in there.

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,030
Now as I mentioned, you can basically put anything you find on the right side of a colon into a variable

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,260
but this officially is named a list because it's more than one value.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,330
We can now grab that border default variable and use it wherever we use that set up,

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,250
so here for that border in SASS introduction and also for that border in the SASS details here.

19
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,920
There is one more border at the bottom for documentation link. So now we're using that border

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,810
default variable everywhere

21
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,770
and as you can see, you can also use variables in variables,

22
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,010
we're using the main color variable in the border default variable

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,290
and if you save this and you reload your page, you again see no changes because this was replaced correctly.

24
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:48,950
As you can see, if you check out the main.css file, there you'll see the border was replaced with

25
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,980
the value you stored here, this however is called a list. Another list would for example be the font family,

26
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,490
so a list is not just something where you have whitespaces separators,

27
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,460
if you use a comma as seen here, this also would be a list you could store it in the variable.

28
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,410
Now we could do that for this set up but since we're not reusing this, it doesn't really matter if we

29
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,050
stored it in a variable or not

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,490
but you could do this,

31
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,720
this is also called a list.

32
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,840
Now on the link here, you actually see lists and maps though.

33
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:27,840
So what is a map then? Well a map is simply a list where each item has a name by which you can access

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,730
it.

35
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,930
Now what does this mean?

36
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,320
Let's add a new variable which I'll name colors because let's say we've got a couple of different colors

37
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,560
in our app, as we actually do.

38
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,210
We do have that purple color but if you scroll down, you also see for example that orange color which

39
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,260
we use and there is one additional color which I won't put into the map though.

40
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,520
Now I already mentioned it,

41
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,660
I want to create a map of colors,

42
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:58,180
obviously we could use main color, we could use secondary color and we could store all these colors and

43
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,600
variables and there would be nothing wrong with that

44
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,650
but sometimes you want to have more structure and you want to group your variables and map allows you

45
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,610
to do that.

46
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,980
A map is constructed by adding parentheses

47
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,120
first of all, that is how you simply start a new map. In the parentheses,

48
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,390
you now create key-value pairs by first of all defining a key,

49
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,550
so a name of your choice, like main, you could name it main color but we're already in the colors map

50
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,980
so it's clear that this is a color.

51
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,440
So main is the key,

52
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:36,790
then you add a colon and then the value of the key and you add more key-value pairs by adding a comma

53
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,320
and then adding secondary

54
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:46,390
and now that would be the orange color. With that, we can actually comment out the main color and by

55
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,680
the way, you can now see that you can use two forward slashes as comments,

56
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,160
this would not be possible in normal CSS but SASS allows you this commenting syntax

57
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:04,840
and now we can use our color map to set our values. The question just is, how do we get this value

58
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,910
or these values out of the map?

59
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:12,190
For example in all the places where we did use main color before, like here in the border default variable

60
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:20,320
definition. It's simple, SASS also is a couple of built-in functions, one of them being map-get which allows

61
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,770
you to get a value from a SASS map.

62
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,240
There, you first of all pass the name of the map, which is colors

63
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:35,410
in our case and then the name of the key you want to get, in our case main. If you now save this, you

64
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,060
of course get an error because we get a couple of other places in the app where we're still trying to access

65
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,080
main color.

66
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,230
So let's copy that map-get syntax and add it there,

67
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,050
so in all the places where we're using main color, we want to use that map-get function now to instead

68
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,910
extract our color from our color map.

69
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,380
Let's also do it for the orange color here,

70
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,040
there we have to reference secondary though

71
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,340
and now with that, if we save this again, it should successfully compile.

72
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,060
If we check out the compiled file here, we can also see that it

73
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:23,950
now still use our colors correctly, also the orange color down there and if we reload our page, this

74
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,410
also looks unchanged

75
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,730
but now we're organizing our code a bit more efficient by using a map for our colors,

76
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,680
hence we're grouping these values according to their function which makes a lot of sense I guess

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,860
and by using normal variables or actually a list variable here too.

78
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,440
So these were lists variables in general and maps

79
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,630
and as you can see, this allows you to save a lot of code because you simply can define it here

80
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,560
and then you use these variables

81
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,920
and if you ever want to change something, you change it here once and you're good to continue.
