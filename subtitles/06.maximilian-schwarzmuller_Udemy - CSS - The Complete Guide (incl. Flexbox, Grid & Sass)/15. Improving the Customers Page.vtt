00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.760
So let's see what we created in this module

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.760
and if all the responsive design is working or if there are some pages left where we have to improve

3
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.510
our code and make the page a bit more responsive.

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.120
So I think our starting page right here up, this is the mobile unit,

5
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.430
this looks pretty nice, if I reduce the size,

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.940
it still looks good,

7
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.870
we don't have any big issues, so I'm quite happy with that. If I click onto the modal, the modal appears, this

8
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.810
is nice.

9
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.250
Let's increase the size,

10
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.550
this looks also good.

11
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.340
So I would say for the starting page,

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.320
let's increase it further, yes the design is pretty nice actually.

13
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.290
Let's have a look at the second page,

14
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.010
the packages; the desktop view is nice, 

15
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.280
we have this footer in here still, we will fix that later

16
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.370
but I think for the moment, this is not a big issue.

17
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.310
The more important thing is that the responsive design right here is working, it looks good and yes,

18
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.470
I'm also quite happy with that,

19
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.130
that's maybe two less width,

20
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.020
actually we won't go below this value and this still looks fine

21
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.980
actually. The great thing is that we didn't have to implement any responsive design on this page because

22
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.330
the default behavior of the elements was sufficient to ensure this quite nice design on this page

23
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.800
actually. Even if I have a look at the mobile view for example, this looks fine right here.

24
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.070
Let's now maybe also switch to the starting page once again,

25
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.000
yes I think it looks still good, even on the real or on the simulated mobile device.

26
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.360
However I think the customers page is not done yet.

27
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.240
This looks OK right here,

28
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.080
not a big problem but right there, I don't know,

29
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.790
this is not how it should be.

30
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.570
I think a better approach would be that as soon as we are in the mobile view, 

31
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.990
so right here, we basically display the image on top,

32
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.600
then we have the text of Mike Statham,

33
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.210
then maybe the text of John Mellow and then the image of John Mellow so that we have kind of a nicer structure.

34
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.970
As soon as we are in the desktop mode, it can actually kind of look the way it looks like right now,

35
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.930
that's fine.

36
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.690
So what this means for us is we have to work on the customers page,

37
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.570
so let's do this now. For that we have to go to the customers.css file

38
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.160
and now think about the way, how we can achieve what we want. Again

39
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.590
we think mobile first,

40
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.160
so we want to make sure that in this view right here, there is an image, then the text, then another text

41
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.540
and then the second image.

42
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.270
Now how can we achieve that?

43
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.690
Well, let's have a look at the structure of this main page.

44
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.800
We have the main element right here,

45
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.760
then we have the div

46
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.560
and in this div, we have the two testimonial classes. Inside these classes, we have the image container

47
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.980
and the info container,

48
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.510
same thing right here for the lower class.

49
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.390
The first problem is that the image and the text is displayed next to each other.

50
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.160
If we look at the code, we can see right here in the testimonial image container what the reason for

51
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.460
that is. We have display inline block once again,

52
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.340
so let's comment this out because we will need it later for the media query

53
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.540
and if we now go back and reload the page, we can see that now we are getting already closer to the result

54
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.670
that we want to have.

55
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.370
Now we have an image, the text, another text and another image.

56
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.990
So with that, we achieved our first step but

57
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.600
still the text is not displayed as intended,

58
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.720
so this is basically the testimonial info class.

59
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.750
Let's maybe have a look at the code and find this class right here

60
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.990
and as we can see, we have also inline block right there.

61
00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.260
So if we comment this out like that, let's see what happens then, if it looks better,

62
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.470
yes

63
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.860
now we have the text aligned to the left but if we now also get rid of the rest of the code right here

64
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.010
because why would it be aligned in the middle

65
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.380
and why should it only have 30% of the width, we don't need that, then we can see that the image

66
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.240
and the text look a lot better now right

67
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.140
because that's probably more of a responsive design or a mobile design that we would like to have in

68
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.820
the end.

69
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.950
So with that, we already improved the image container and the info container,

70
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.010
this looks better now.

71
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.370
What we could then also change between the two testimonial classes, so right here and right there, is

72
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.610
this margin in between that we had. I think if we just comment this out for the moment, we would kind

73
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.750
of get the two testimonials a bit closer together,

74
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.530
let's see,

75
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.020
yes

76
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.250
and I think with that, the page looks a bit cleaner maybe.

77
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.450
What we can also get rid of is the vertical align right here,

78
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.090
I don't think we need that anymore, so we can also comment this out right here because now we have normal

79
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.950
block level elements right here and we don't need that vertical align comment anymore.

80
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.140
And then we have this testimonial list right here

81
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.270
but I don't think we have this class anymore in our code, so we can also comment this out for the moment,

82
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.220
this shouldn't have any impact on our website right here,

83
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.960
no it hasn't,

84
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.400
so we also got rid of this code now

85
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:38.690
and I think with that, our mobile design looks quite OK now. As we can see, it's probably not perfect yet

86
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.020
but we will come back to this image part later throughout the course and change the way the images are displayed

87
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.960
in general.

88
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.540
Therefore, I do not want to focus too much onto this right now,

89
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.780
the only thing I want to make sure is that once we hit our desktop design, I want to make sure that the

90
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.080
design doesn't stay like that but that we have some responsive design in it.

91
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:07.130
For that, let's go back to our code and let's add the media query at the bottom right here.

92
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.380
The media query should again follow the behavior we know so far,

93
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:19.300
so the min width of 40rem, and which classes do we now target?

94
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.310
I think the testimonial class right here with the 3rem left and right margin is definitely something

95
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.650
that we want to have back,

96
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.610
so let's add it right here

97
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:39.040
and comment the code in, let's see what happens if I reload the page, we have a bit more margin between that in

98
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.680
the desktop version and that's definitely fine because we have more space available right here.

99
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:52.630
The next class we could target is and we could delete this course before, like that.

100
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:59.500
So the next class we could target is our image container right here because I would like to add back

101
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:05.310
these two things right here, the display inline block an the vertical align middle declarations.

102
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.100
So let's go down here

103
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:16.010
and add it as a second class right here, we shouldn't forget about the curly braces right here

104
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:23.800
and we can delete this part and let's comment in the two declarations right here.

105
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:32.450
If we do that and reload the page, we can see that our images are now again displayed to the left and

106
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.600
to the right, like that,

107
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.880
so that's quite OK as it is for now.

108
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:44.420
You might probably say that this looks kind of off but trust me, as I said, we will work on this image

109
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.100
part in more detail later

110
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.370
and then this structure will be exactly what we're going to need.

111
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:57.560
What we still could do though and this brings us quickly back to our mobile design, please excuse that

112
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.200
now,

113
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:05.540
but actually, why don't we make the image container with a width of 100%

114
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:11.680
where it's possible, like that in the mobile design, like that because with that the image gets bigger and bigger,

115
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:27.780
like that and if we then increase our max width to the 40rem we had for our media query right here

116
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.410
like that, then we could also make a smooth transition to that,

117
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:36.720
can we see it? Now it jumps to the media query and I think this looks a bit better because now we

118
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.280
really have the images in the center

119
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:45.600
when we watch the mobile view and then jump into our mobile query where the text gets kind of pulled apart, 

120
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.220
like that,

121
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.350
I think this looks better.

122
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:53.430
So sorry for that little jump back to our mobile part again but I think with that, we can delete this

123
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.540
part right here

124
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:59.460
and we also added the image container to our media query right here.

125
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:07.630
The next thing we should add back in in our media query is the testimonial info right here, right there,

126
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.770
this is what we change before.

127
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:18.000
Let's maybe add align and this can of course stay in but we should bring back the display inline block

128
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.800
and the vertical align and the maximum width.

129
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.890
So this brings us back to the design that we had before, so this is the media query right here,

130
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.170
so as you can see the text now jumps to the other side,

131
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.480
that's exactly how it's intended

132
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.450
and as you can see, we now draw it apart or pull it apart

133
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:42.300
and as soon as our text has enough space, it jumps next to the image.

134
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.090
That's actually exactly the behavior that we want to have

135
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.330
and I have to state that again, we'll dive into the details of this page throughout the course so this is kind

136
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.100
of a draft mode

137
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:53.740
still.

138
00:09:53.950 --> 00:10:00.550
However we added back the testimonial info class right here, therefore we can also delete this part from

139
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.000
here,

140
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:07.480
this part that we commented out and although we will come back to this customers page,

141
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.870
I think that the behavior we saw right here,

142
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.400
so this jump basically,

143
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:19.000
so we go from the mobile to that interim situation right here and then to the final position we want

144
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.720
to have,

145
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:26.080
maybe we should fix that right now because it's an easy fix actually, because the problem simply is that

146
00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.140
once we are leaving our mobile view, the image is simply too big

147
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:36.140
and as soon as we get more and more space right here, the text can jump next to the image as I just explained.

148
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:45.080
So why don't we just go back to our code and down to our media query and now simply add a width, right

149
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:53.450
here of let's say maybe 66, so two-thirds of the entire page for our image container.

150
00:10:53.450 --> 00:11:00.080
Because if we do that and reload the page, we can see that now, we don't have this jump anymore because

151
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.390
we are in the mobile view,

152
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.550
then we come to our 640 pixels

153
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:11.210
and as this image only occupies two-thirds of our page, well there is enough space for our testimonial

154
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:17.150
info class right here which only uses 30% of the width and therefore, we could easily fix this

155
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.240
issue and make sure that our page,

156
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.100
well as I think, already looks a lot better.

157
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:29.180
There is another problem though before we finished this customers page for now, because if we increase

158
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:35.060
the size of our website, as you can see it right here, I think there was a point where it doesn't look

159
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.430
good anymore and I would say this point is reached right here, 

160
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:44.870
let's say at around about maybe 1500 pixels. I think this looks still nice but then

161
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:50.040
if it gets pulled apart further, it doesn't look good anymore

162
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:57.260
and we also learned how we can solve such a problem, because we basically only need to make sure that

163
00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.740
the testimonial class,

164
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:05.630
so this one right here which basically contains, as we can see it, the images and the text, so right here

165
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.870
and right there, both times we have this testimonial class.

166
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:15.620
So if we would give this container a maximum width of this 1500 pixels, then we

167
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.030
could ensure that the page gets not pulled apart too far.

168
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:26.630
Therefore let's go back to the testimony class and also add the max width property right here with

169
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.190
1500 pixels.

170
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:36.440
Now just in case you wonder why we're using pixels this time, the more consistent approach would of course

171
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.090
be using rem right here

172
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:45.230
but as we only applied rem so far for our media queries and I would also like to show you that you can use

173
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.090
pixels there,

174
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.710
it's not what I recommend but it's what you can do,

175
00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:52.940
I think it makes sense to use the 1500 pixels right here.

176
00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:59.150
As I said, this is more the demonstration purpose right here not the real consistency approach that we 

177
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:05.390
would normally follow when creating our responsive website. If we do that and reload the page, we can

178
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:08.600
see that it keeps moving the way we had it before

179
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.860
but as soon as we reach the 1500 pixels, it is stuck right here.

180
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:19.070
The problem still is that it's kind of stuck in a strange way because the distance increases to the

181
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.360
right of John Mellow right here

182
00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:27.530
but Mike Statham, our first testimonial is stuck to this left side and this issue can also be quickly

183
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.250
solved if we just change our margin right here,

184
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:35.230
so this one, the top and bottom margin is fine but we should simply use our margin

185
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.590
auto trick, that's the trick I showed you in the units module

186
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.970
and as you can see, we can apply it once again right here.

187
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:49.290
If I now reload the page, we can see that we now have a really good status for our customers page.

188
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.790
We have the starting situation right here with the mobile view,

189
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:58.550
I think this little gap right here and right there is totally fine, that's simply due to the margin that we

190
00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:03.830
have right here on top of our first testimonial class and right here on top of the footer

191
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:10.540
but I think this is OK to keep this little distance and if we then come to our 640 pixels breaking point,

192
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:18.310
it jumps immediately to the desktop view and it gets bigger and bigger up to the point where we reach

193
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.090
our 1500 pixels width

194
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.880
and with that, it also looks nice on bigger screens.

195
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.120
And with that, our customers page looks good,

196
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.480
we now have a really nice responsive design.

197
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.780
The problem though is that if I look back to our packages page which looks actually fine,

198
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.510
I think if we are honest, we should also set a limit to the width

199
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:47.580
these packages can have because I think also from this 1500 pixels on,

200
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.930
so right here, it shouldn't be able to increase anymore.

201
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:56.000
So let's implement that fix to our packages page in the next lecture.
