1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,710
You finished this course,

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,780
congratulations,

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,290
you did an awesome job.

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,060
But the thing is, with finishing this course,

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,700
you did the first big step

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:16,800
but actually, there are additional steps that you could take now to become a real CSS expert. Now which

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,180
steps could these be?

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,350
Let's have a look.

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:25,330
Now obviously, it's always about practicing, practicing and more practicing. In this course,

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,180
we already gave you plenty of opportunities to practice the things you learned but it never ends.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:37,300
You should also try to build your own web projects, maybe clone popular web pages, like the Emerson product

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:37,810
page,

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,800
things like that, where you try to implement the page you're seeing with the features or with the concepts

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,170
you learned in this course.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,020
Additionally, you should also dive into more advanced CSS topics. In this course, we cover it all

16
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,490
but there's always more you can learn.

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,530
You should dive into the Mozilla Developer Network which we reference a lot in this course or into

18
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:05,590
blog posts which explain advanced usages, concepts, things that go beyond the scope of this course or

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,470
beyond what you learned here,

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,940
patterns you might not have seen before,

21
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:16,980
this is also something where you can grow as a developer. And last but not least, if you got CSS down

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,650
but you didn't have a look at Javascript yet, learn Javascript

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,610
because with HTML, CSS and Javascript, you got everything you need to build amazing front-ends and

24
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,540
front-end web applications.

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,450
Definitely and that's actually the final important thing

26
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:39,250
we wanted to add right here because in the end, if you finish all these things or dive into all these

27
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,340
topics Max mentioned, you will become a CSS expert and also a web development expert

28
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,390
in the long term and therefore as said before, it was a pleasure to have you as a student and we hope

29
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,240
to see you in other courses.

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,770
Yes definitely, see you there hopefully,

31
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,330
bye.
