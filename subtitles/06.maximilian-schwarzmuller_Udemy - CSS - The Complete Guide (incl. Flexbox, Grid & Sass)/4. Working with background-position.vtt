00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.220
We had a look at background size,

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.960
now let's position the image

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.020
and as I said, we can do it as with background position. Background position has a couple of ways of using

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.520
it,

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.280
the simplest usage is to define a pixel value, let's say 20 pixels.

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.500
If we do that and we reload,

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.870
what we can see is that the image is moved to the right by 20 pixels.

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.950
The first value defines the x-axis,

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.090
it defines how the left edge of the image should be positioned relative to the left edge of the surrounding

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.700
container

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.160
and if we set 20 pixels, this means the left edge of the image, 

12
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.130
so here where the image ends should be positioned 20 pixels to the left edge of the container,

13
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.450
so there is an empty space of 20 pixels. We can also define a second value of let's say 50 pixels,

14
00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.060
this is now the same for the top edge of the image and the top edge of the container.

15
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.430
Now there is some whitespace at the top too.

16
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.110
Now we can also use percentage values, for example we can set 10%,

17
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.390
now the result might surprise you. If you reload,

18
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.460
actually there's no whitespace on the left because this now actually works a bit different, with

19
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.040
the percentage values,

20
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.890
you can define how much of the excess space,

21
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.660
so of the parts of the image that do not make it into the container,

22
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.340
how these parts should be distributed.

23
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.560
Now regarding the width, the full image is displayed in the container, it's not cropped on either the left

24
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.520
or the right,

25
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.810
so we can enter whatever we want here for the first value,

26
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.620
it will not change the way the image is displayed.

27
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.240
So let's set it to 0% which means the left part of the excess space, of which we have none

28
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.630
is perfectly aligned to the left edge of the container,

29
00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.330
however this becomes clearer if we also set the top. The second value now again refers to the y-axis

30
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.750
and if we set 10% here, this means that 10% of our excess space should actually go over

31
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.490
the top. If we reload,

32
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.120
this will actually lead to our image being pushed down because and that's something you have to know, the

33
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.660
default if you only set one value, is 50%.

34
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.060
So if I set 50 and I reload, we get the exact same result as if we said no second value at all. 50%

35
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:39.070
means of the parts of the image that do not fit into the container, so that are cropped of, 50% will

36
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.700
be cropped at the bottom and 50% will be cropped at the top.

37
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.430
If we set this to 10%, only 10% will be cropped at the top which means that more parts

38
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.590
are cropped at the bottom, so the image is effectively pushed down in its container.

39
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.860
If we set this to 100% on the other hand, all the content that has to be cropped will be cropped at

40
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.620
the top and nothing will be cropped at the bottom,

41
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.190
so this results in the bottom edge of the image being perfectly aligned to the bottom edge of the container

42
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.700
and everything is cropped at the top.

43
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.480
This is how you can control the positioning.

44
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.780
Now manually setting this is possible

45
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.980
but there also is a predefined value, center, 

46
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.510
it's the same as if you set 50%, 50%.

47
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.450
So if you set center, it's perfectly centered because it means of the parts of the image that do

48
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.890
not fit into the container, no matter if it's on the y or x-axis,

49
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.080
50% will be cropped on the left and right and top and bottom, so that the center of the image

50
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.690
is the center of the container.

51
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.740
You can also set this to left top for example,

52
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.170
this means that the left part of the image, the left edge of the image is positioned on the left edge of

53
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.950
the container,

54
00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.220
so no cropping happens on the left and that the top of the image is aligned to the top of the container,

55
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.320
so no cropping at the top.

56
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.940
This could be translated with 0% 0%.

57
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.480
So if we save this, we actually see no rocks at all, we see all the sky. On the other hand, we can set

58
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.780
this to left bottom to say left should be aligned and bottom,

59
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:24.190
so now we will see all the rocks but less sky because no cropping is happening at the bottom and you

60
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.650
can even combine that with percentage values,

61
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.430
so you could say to the left we want to crop 10%, to the bottom

62
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.820
we want to crop 20% for example,

63
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:41.140
now we will see some rocks but a little bit less, it's moved down a bit and this gives you full control over

64
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.180
how you position your image.

65
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.490
Now for our page here, I think this setting is actually quite nice,

66
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.540
so I will stick to that.

67
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.510
Now there is more you can set up regarding the background,

68
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.700
so let's dive into the additional properties you can set in the next lecture.
