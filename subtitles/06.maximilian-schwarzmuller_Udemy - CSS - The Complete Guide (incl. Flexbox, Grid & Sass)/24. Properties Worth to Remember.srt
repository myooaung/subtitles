00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:09,020
Before we conclude this section and dive into the next module, I promised you that list of properties

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,990
which are worth remembering.

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:18,020
Now keep in mind, properties are the part in front of the colon and you might of course be wondering which ones

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,880
you should use.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,380
You saw that long reference of properties but here's a list of properties we already used and what you

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,660
will see over and over again.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:34,150
The color property to change a text color, the background color property to change the background of

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:40,510
a box, display to change the way it's positioned or how it behaves from block to inline to inline block

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:48,640
to none, the padding to add some distance between the content and the border, the border itself to add a

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,590
border, margin to add some spacing around the box, the width to

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,040
set the width and the height to set the height.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,210
There are more important properties of course which we'll see from time to time and there are way more

13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,960
which you see or which you use very rarely,

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,740
these are core properties which you already saw and which are definitely worth to remember.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,080
Now we will see way more,

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,200
we already did see more than just these few but you can learn them and you will learn them by heart

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,720
by simply using them.

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,250
Don't go to a reference and learn them just by reading them,

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,230
use them and that helps you really memorizing what they do and when to use them.
