1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,150
So let's have a look at this first method now,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:13,810
at this first source for our font families, the font family which is saved locally on our user's computer.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,830
Because you might say that so far throughout this module, we didn't have a problem with the font families at

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:26,760
all because basically, our browsers supported all of the font families we used besides the unknown ones

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,810
which I used to show you with the syntax in general.

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,550
But the problem or it's not a problem

7
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,670
but the thing we have at the moment is that in Chrome right here, we have a lot of default font families

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,690
which are supported

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,910
and that's awesome

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,940
but what's not so awesome is that we cannot control the browser

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:54,810
our website visitors are using. Therefore, in case your website visitor doesn't use Chrome, with the approaches

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,720
we use so far except for the web font of course but with the general approach of simply adding a font

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:08,520
family to our code, chances are that not all our users will be able to receive the font and therefore,

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,510
the fallback will be applied because the problem is, if you google for CSS font stack right here

15
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:25,420
and then click onto this link, then you can see that the so-called website fonts only include a limited

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:32,320
amount of font families because these are the generic families right here and the corresponding font

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,030
families that are installed locally on your machine.

18
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:42,430
So just by using a Windows machine, chances are quite high that Arial Black is installed on your computer

19
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,540
by default,

20
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:49,420
the same thing is true if you're using a Mac and if you go down right here for example to serif, you

21
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,710
can see that Bodoni, this one right here is not installed at all on the Mac.

22
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,630
Vice-versa,

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,480
we see for this Didot,

24
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,150
I don't know how it's pronounced to be honest, that this font family is not installed at all

25
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,590
on Windows machines but on many Macs and this is what you have to keep in mind.

26
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:13,240
In the end, just by adding font family, so our code that we added right here in the shared file, so just by

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:20,460
adding this font family property without adding a web font like we did right here,

28
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:26,980
so if we would delete that and just add the font family like that, the only two things we would rely

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,830
on is that either our user has this font family installed on his machine,

30
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,920
maybe by default or afterwards or that our browser knows this font family.

31
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,780
The problem with these approaches is of course, again we cannot control

32
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,820
neither of that two factors because we cannot force our users to install a font family and we cannot

33
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,420
force our users to use a specific browser.

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,070
So one option you always have of course

35
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,730
if you want to make sure that you will reach a large audience with your font family is to go to

36
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,300
cssfontstack.com and check for the font families available right here

37
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,290
because with that, you can of course make sure that a lot of your users should have this font family installed

38
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,700
on their machines and therefore, should be able to see your website the way you intend it to look like.

39
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,590
But of course that's not the best approach because we don't want to be limited by the default font families

40
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,200
installed on the machine.

41
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:31,790
Therefore, we used this web font right here which we imported from Google fonts and although we

42
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:37,910
did that already, I will like to take a closer look at that and show you what we did, how we can do it

43
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:45,890
and why using this is probably a better approach than just relying onto the fact that our users have installed

44
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,440
our font family by default on the machines.
