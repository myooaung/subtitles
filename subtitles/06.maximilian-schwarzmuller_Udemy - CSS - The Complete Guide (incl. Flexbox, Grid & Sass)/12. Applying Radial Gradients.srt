00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,580
You saw the linear gradient in the last lecture, 

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:11,130
let's comment it out and let's add another background image, this time with the radial gradient function.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,610
The radial gradient function as the name suggests allows you to define a radial gradient,

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,770
so not one that starts at one edge and goes to another one but one that starts at a certain shape and then

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,080
transitions to all the areas around it.

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:32,440
Let's start with a simple gradient again, red blue because we can clearly see that. If we reload,

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:38,880
this is our default radial gradient, positioned in the middle by default and the shape is an ellipse,

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,150
it's not a circle, it's an ellipse

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,900
and you see it starts with the first color and then transitions to the second color which is all around

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,680
it.

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,910
Of course here too,

12
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:55,270
you can define multiple colors like green and the shape will simply be kept

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:01,680
and now we have a red ellipse going to a blue ellipse going to a green ellipse,

14
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,740
this is how that works.

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,250
Now of course you can also change the shape,

16
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,210
for example you can add a first argument that can be circle,

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,230
that's the alternative, the only alternative you have to the ellipse,

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:22,100
you can set it to be a circle instead of an ellipse. If you now reload and watch closely, you see it now indeed

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,180
is a perfect circle, no longer an ellipse.

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,620
Now of course you can also change the position, where it should start.

21
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:37,520
Right now, it was always centered but maybe you don't want that, you can add @ attribute here and say @top

22
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,360
for example, if you do that and you reload,

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,100
now you see the center of the circle is right in the middle of the top,

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,900
you can also say @top left to put it to the top left.

25
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,580
Now the center of the circle is in the top left and then the radial gradient starts from there.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,210
You can also enter custom values here,

27
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:10,340
you could say 20%, 50%, if you do that you actually see it's moved 20% from the left,

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,520
so the circle of the innermost shape is 20% from the left and 50% from the top.

29
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,190
So this is basically how you know it, first value is the x-axis,

30
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,650
second value is the y-axis,

31
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,480
of course you can also use pixels here.

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,270
Now with that, we got the shape and we got the position,

33
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,630
now what's missing?

34
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,030
The missing piece of course is the size,

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,420
you can define the size by for example adding 20 pixels after a circle.

36
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,460
If you do that and you reload,

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,660
now you see the circle is very tiny because now and that's important,

38
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,820
the entire circle, without the outermost part,

39
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,290
so in this case the red and the blue area, have a total of combined diameter of 20 pixels,

40
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,230
so that's basically the width of the shape.

41
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,200
Now this only works for the circle, for the ellipse,

42
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,480
if you use that which would be the default, this actually doesn't work because what would the 20 pixels

43
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:17,000
be referring to? Of course you could add two values here and reload,

44
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,250
now you again create a circle though,

45
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,960
so you could add different values to turn this back to a non-circle.

46
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:33,040
So with two values, you can also style the ellipse, give it a certain width and height like that, first

47
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,260
value is width, second value is height

48
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,430
but there also are some keywords in case you don't want to do it like that.

49
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:45,190
You can also add something like farthest side.

50
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,500
Now what does this do?

51
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,870
Watch the current value and then reload.

52
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:58,150
Now what this actually means and you can barely see it, that the ending shape and that simply means until

53
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,140
it transitions to the outermost color,

54
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,970
so in case of two colors after the first color or in case after three colors as we have it here, after

55
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,960
the second color, that the ending shape and you can barely see it,

56
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,200
the outer rings of the blue color touch the farthest side,

57
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:22,090
so the side furthest away from the center, from the position of the element, this barely touches this

58
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:29,040
side and on the other hand, you would have closest side to reduce the size,

59
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,120
now the outermost circle of the blue color

60
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:38,140
and again that's hard to see but you can see there is still some non-perfect green part here,

61
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,180
this touches the closest side and it also concerns top and bottom by the way

62
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:51,010
and you can also not use the sides but the corners. Closest corner for example ensures that the outermost

63
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,110
ring touches the closest corner

64
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:59,070
and on the other hand, farthest corner allows you to control that it touches the farthest corner.

65
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:05,710
So these are some great defaults you can use to control the size of your radial gradient and that's

66
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:12,350
actually all there's to it. What you can still do is you can define color stops like blue after 70%,

67
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,800
you can do that to change

68
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,160
where it should transition to green and so on

69
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,850
but besides that, it behaves like the linear gradient,

70
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:27,760
you can define multiple colors, you can use hex codes, you can use color functions and so on and that is

71
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,490
how you can use a radial gradient.

72
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:35,940
Now just as linear gradients, they are added as background images and they can be stacked.

73
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,250
Now let's dive into that stacking part in the next lecture.
