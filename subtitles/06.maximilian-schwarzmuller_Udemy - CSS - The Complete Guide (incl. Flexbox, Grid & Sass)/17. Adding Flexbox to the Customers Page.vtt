00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.870
So let's turn the customers page into a flexbox construct

2
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.470
and to be honest, we actually don't have a problem right here in the mobile view,

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.220
this looks totally right,

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.580
we only need flexbox right here to make sure that the desktop view is displayed like that.

5
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.610
For that, we simply have to focus onto the media query regarding the testimonial class and turn it into

6
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.740
a flex container

7
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.660
once we are in the desktop view and then add the properties we need to make sure that the content is

8
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.960
displayed correctly. For that,

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.610
I'm right here in the customers.css file and as I said for the mobile view, there is nothing to

10
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.970
change because we don't have display inline block or anything like that,

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.680
so this is totally fine.

12
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.080
We do have display inline block though down here in our media query

13
00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.730
but if we now simply add display flex right here to our testimonial class, like that, let's reload the

14
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:08.720
page, it doesn't look good yet but we'll fix that in a few seconds. Then we could actually also get rid of

15
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.800
the display and vertical align properties right here like we did it before,

16
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.650
so let's see what happens then,

17
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.460
didn't change a thing but doesn't look good now

18
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:28.670
but if I now simply say that we want to align the items, right, to the center,

19
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.180
keep in mind our cross axis goes from top to bottom.

20
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.750
So if we can align the image and the container, this should actually work, as you can see right here it

21
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.710
looks good now

22
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.220
and what we finally can do is to get some space to the left of this image is we could again add justify

23
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.390
content right here and use space around this time.

24
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.790
This is a new value we didn't use so far,

25
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.410
as I said, make sure to have a look at the MDN where you can find a lot of different values you

26
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.530
can apply to these different properties

27
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.950
but if we now use space around and reload the page, you can see that now we basically easily turned

28
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.150
this customers page right here also into a, let's maybe get rid of that, row right here.

29
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:22.210
So we easily turned this customers page also into a flexbox style and as you can see, it still works perfectly,

30
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.790
we have the maximum width and when we are right here, it jumps into the mobile mode. By the way, if you

31
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.800
wonder why the footer is outside of our window right here,

32
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.810
this is simply due to the fact that I am zoomed in. Once I use the normal 100% zoom level as you

33
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.810
can see it right here,

34
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.580
this page looks fine, 

35
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.600
the packages page looks fine and the same thing is true for our starting page right here which is

36
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.780
always working as we know.

37
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.890
However with that, as I just said, the flex container part is finished. Now in the next lecture, we'll have

38
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.520
a look at the flex items because we worked with the flex items as part of the flex container but we

39
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.320
can also specifically target the flex items and change the way they are displayed.

40
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.190
Let's find out how this works in the next lecture.
