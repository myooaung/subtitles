We covered a lot about the CSS basics over the last modules.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,210
Now before we practice all these things in the next module, here are some additional things you got to

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,250
know. In this module,

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:21,110
we'll dive into some additional details on CSS classes, for example when you should use them and when

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:28,880
you should use ID selectors. We'll have a look at the important annotation which we can add to our declarations.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,630
We'll have a brief look at pseudo classes and elements again and especially we'll have a look at the

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,830
not pseudo class.

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,410
So let's dive right into that.
