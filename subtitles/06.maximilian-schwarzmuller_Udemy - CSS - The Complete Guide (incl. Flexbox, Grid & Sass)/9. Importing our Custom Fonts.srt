1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,820
So the last option we have is adding our own fonts to our website.

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,930
Well, this course is not about creating fonts,

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,910
therefore I will use another approach to show you how this works.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:22,710
For that, I'm back on Google fonts and let's now maybe select a Monospace font because we had sans-serif

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,270
a lot,

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,270
so let's see, what could we use,

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,110
I think this one, AnonymousPro,

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,870
this looks actually quite nice.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:36,690
If we look at this option right here, we talked about that where we have the font weights and the font style

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,810
right here defined, we can see that we have four different so-called font faces right here.

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,500
So let's now select the regular 400,

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:52,310
so the default font face right here and again, press onto the plus as we did it before.

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,440
Now right here, we can now get rid of the Roboto font, we don't need that and we could of course import it

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,190
again as we learned it but this is our own font, right?

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,160
Well, at least that's what we pretend now,

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,470
so we want to find another way how to embed it onto our website

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,070
and for that, we can simply download this font by clicking right here.

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,800
Once you finished the download and unzip the file, you can see these four ttf files right here.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll talk about the file names and which files we have right here in the next lecture,

20
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,530
so let's stick to this ttf for the moment and as we can see, we have four different files.

21
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,990
Each file represents a font face,

22
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:41,280
so we have the bold font face, the bold-italic font face, the regular-italic font face and the regular font

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,150
face.

24
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,030
So we want to add this regular font face to our page,

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,180
so let's focus onto this one now.

26
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:55,930
Now to import this onto our website, we simply have to go to our CSS file. As I will only use it

27
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,920
in our packages.css file,

28
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,860
I will add it right here on top of the page.

29
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:09,760
So what we need to do is, we need to write @font-face like that and of course add the curly braces and

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,820
now we need to specify a name for our font family.

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:24,400
Well, the font family was anonymous so let's maybe call it AnonymousPro, like that and we will

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,840
again put it into quotation marks,

33
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,720
you could also use single quotation marks if you want to but I will stick to the normal quotation marks

34
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,580
right here.

35
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,850
So that's what we have,

36
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,650
we now said that we have a font family that we want to import,

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,710
that's basically what this code right here tells us.

38
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,950
The problem is that we also need the files which contain the information,

39
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,560
so we need to add a source right here, like that and this should be a URL.

40
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,480
The problem is that we don't have a URL at the moment because we didn't add the file

41
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,210
we want to use to our code right here,

42
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,300
so I will simply drag and drop this file right here into our packages folder because we only want

43
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,370
to use it right there,

44
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,130
so that's the AnonymousPro

45
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,480
regular.ttf,

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,590
that's the file I just dragged right there.

47
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,100
So we now have the URL which is simply

48
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:29,180
AnonymousPro.ttf, that's our file name, so not pro, including regular,

49
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,970
sorry for that,

50
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,380
we have to add this too

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
and that's it.

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,180
With that, we imported our own font face, our custom font face. As you can see, not a lot different to

53
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:46,440
the way we did it right here with our @import but this time, we simply added our file directly to our

54
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,560
folder where our code is located

55
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,050
and with that, if we would assume that we have our code for the website hosted on our server, we would

56
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,180
also host our code for the font families right there

57
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,660
and with that, we would again ensure that each visitor of our website can access this font.

58
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:12,000
However, we have to add this font of course here in our packages info class

59
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,080
and let's get rid of these properties for now

60
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:24,690
and let's change Roboto with AnonymousPro now, like that and if we now go back to our website,

61
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,030
we can actually minimize right here

62
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:36,440
and reload the page, you can see that we now use our imported custom font that we used.

63
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,420
And this is really cool actually

64
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,520
and now you could say, well that's easy,

65
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,760
why don't we always do it like that?

66
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,320
Well the issue is the following; if we now have another look at Google fonts right here and think back

67
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,160
about the different font faces, we have this regular one and this bold 700 one for example and let's say

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,570
that we want to have this bold, this 700 font weight,

69
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,900
then we could add this of course right here, like that, the font weight of 700

70
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:15,170
but the problem is if we now reload the page, like that, this bold style is not applied because again, keep

71
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,810
that in mind, we only imported the regular font family,

72
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:28,310
so this one right here, the Regular.ttf and therefore our code and our browser have no idea what a bold

73
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,490
AnonymousPro font face would look like.

74
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:37,230
So what we have to do right here is we have to import this specific font face.

75
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:45,260
For that, we simply copy this, first font face right here and now important, don't change the font family

76
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,650
because we of course want to refer to the same font family,

77
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:57,660
we only want to be able to apply a bolder font way to it. Therefore we first have to add our bold file

78
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,670
to our folder,

79
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,240
so this one right here, like that,

80
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,010
that's the AnonymousProBold,

81
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,400
so we have to name it accordingly,

82
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,320
AnonymousProBold, 

83
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,240
like that

84
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:17,140
and if we save that and keep in mind, we still left the font weight of 700 right here and reload the page, then

85
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,640
you can see that the bold style was applied.

86
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:28,810
The problem is that the code we wrote right now is not correct because look back at our syntax. If we

87
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,580
scroll up again right here, we can see that there is no difference in the font

88
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,160
in general, the source is different,

89
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:43,350
yes but how should our browser or the code be able to differentiate between these two imports we have?

90
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,950
So for example if I now change the font weight to 400 here, which would be the normal font weight and

91
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:57,160
reload the page, nothing would change, even if I change it to normal for example, like that.

92
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,720
Because the problem is that based on the code we wrote right now,

93
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,770
well we will simply apply this last font face import, the first one won't be imported.

94
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,460
Now we can simply change this

95
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,730
and by the way, I forgot the semi-colons right here and right there,

96
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:19,060
please excuse that and make sure to add this. So we can change this by adding a font weight right here

97
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,590
of 700 because that's the import that we did,

98
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,460
that's the font weight that we have for our bold font style right here.

99
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,590
With that, if we now scroll down again and keep this to normal

100
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,590
and now reload, you can see that we now have the thinner font style

101
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,830
and if we change it back to 700, then if we did it correctly, we should have our bold font style back

102
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,480
again.

103
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,740
So that's the crucial thing right here,

104
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:54,580
if you import multiple font faces up here, then make sure to add the font weight which is the differentiation

105
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,390
criteria between our different font faces,

106
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,060
otherwise you will always use the last code.

107
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,840
Another thing we could change right here by the way is the starting letter right here,

108
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,860
this should actually be a small letter, not a capital letter.

109
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,130
This is not crucial though but this can cause problems with the Internet Explorer,

110
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,670
so make sure to make these letters right here small ones 

111
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,530
and then of course, accordingly change this file right here

112
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,770
and the second one also to these small letters, like that.

113
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:36,820
That's just a small cosmetic change but we want to write our code as good as possible, therefore

114
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,980
definitely makes sense to change that.

115
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:45,730
With that, we saw how we can import our fonts with font face and how we can use our custom fonts with

116
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920
all the pros and cons that we have

117
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:54,070
but so far we only used this ttf file format right here.

118
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,640
Now let's have a look at that in more detail and see if we have other file formats available for our

119
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,670
font faces.
