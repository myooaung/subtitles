00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.670
Which tools are we using throughout this course?

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.640
Well, the good news is there are only two tools that we will mainly work with.

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.880
The first tool is a tool you saw already when Max showed you how CSS generally works,

4
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.730
it's our code editor, Visual Studio Code.

5
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.000
You can download it for free right here on code.visualstudio.com

6
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.270
and here is the link and

7
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.210
of course you can use any code editor, text editor or IDE of your choice.

8
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.570
We just use Visual Studio Code because we think it's really nice to use, really powerful and for that,

9
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.310
a good choice for this course. In addition to this, we also use Chrome as a browser.

10
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.860
Again, you can use any browser of your choice but the main reason why we are using Chrome is because Chrome

11
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.400
comes with really powerful developer tools and we will dive into these developer tools throughout the course.

12
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.150
Generally, having powerful developer tools is really helpful; especially if you want to understand

13
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.230
the core logic of CSS and how it interacts with different parts on our website.

14
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.510
So this is it actually

15
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.160
if you want to use Visual Studio Code and Chrome. If you don't want to, use the IDE and the browser of

16
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.630
your choice. With that, it's now finally time to get started with the first core module of this course.
