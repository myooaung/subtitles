00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,680
So let's work on these bullet points together now. For that,

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:13,630
I'll again go back to my HTML file and there on the unordered list, for each plan now, not just for

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:19,680
the highlighted one, I'll add a class to the unordered list and call it

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:26,300
plan__features. Of course that name as always is totally up to you.

5
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:34,240
Now I will grab that class attribute and add it to all unordered lists, so that we style them all and

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,710
not just one of them and then I'll go back

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,400
to the main.css file

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,190
and in there, I'll add my plan__features class selector and now the idea here

9
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,610
is to simply set the list style to none.

10
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,740
You saw this earlier in the course, list style none removes the bullet points,

11
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,890
additionally I want to get rid of all the margin and padding introduced by the unordered list.

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,450
And with that if we save this and we reload,

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,510
this looks much nicer in my opinion.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,070
We can still clearly see that these are different features but now they don't look like a boring

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,090
bullet point list. One thing I want to do though is, I want to have a little bit more space between

16
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,410
the items, top and bottom I mean not left and right,

17
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,740
that's fine but they should have some space to the item sitting below them.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:34,250
Well this can be achieved by simply going to the plan features, so each list item and changing the margin

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,980
of it.

20
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:44,850
Now you could of course simply say plan features li to select the list item in the plan features

21
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:51,870
class and set a margin of let's say 8 pixels top and bottom and 0 left and right

22
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,370
and if you save that, we get the desired style, looks good to me. An alternative which I will use

23
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,280
is that you assign a class to each of these list items, to basically stay in line with the rest of your

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,090
code where you also use a lot of classes.

25
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,790
We could name this plan__feature and of course this class assignment should now

26
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,390
be added to every single list item.

27
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,210
Again, this is kind of optional,

28
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:25,980
you can of course use the combinator I just showed you, using a class probably is a bit cleaner or

29
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,950
more in line with your other code but ultimately, it's up to you. If you do use a class though, you simply

30
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,750
set it to plan feature like this, of course just using the plan feature class selector.

31
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,160
Once you save that and save the HTML file too, you can again reload the page and see the same look

32
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,000
as before.

33
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,610
So this is the list styled differently,

34
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,490
now the button is another thing we have to work on and I also want to change a style of my title

35
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,740
and my price.

36
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,510
So these are the things coming up in the next lecture.
