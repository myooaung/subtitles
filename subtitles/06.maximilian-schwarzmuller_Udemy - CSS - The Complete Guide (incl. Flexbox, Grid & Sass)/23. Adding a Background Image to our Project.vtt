00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:10.730
So let's add an image as a background for this area, for this reddish pink area here.

2
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.780
Now I added an image, you can find it attached to this video,

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.560
it's this one here, freedom because we are a really great host with a lot of freedom for our customers

4
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.860
and we can add this as a background image for the product overview where we have that other color right

5
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.260
now by simply removing the color assignment and using the URL helper method,

6
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.740
this allows us to reference an image file which will be loaded as a background thereafter. URL

7
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.470
takes a string,

8
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.250
so you have to add double quotation marks,

9
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.460
opening and closing and in between, you add the path pointing to your image.

10
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.790
This could also be a hyper reference, so HTTP something, some link to a file on a server or a local file

11
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.680
as in our case. If it's in a subfolder, you would add subfolder slash whatever the path to the file,

12
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.420
in this case it's in the same folder,

13
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.250
so I'll just add freedom.jpg and that's all.

14
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.410
If I add this and I reload, this adds the image.

15
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.330
Now it's too big as you can see

16
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.170
but for now, this will do, this is better from a contrast perspective in my opinion than the solid color

17
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.270
was.

18
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.650
We'll work on positioning and working with that image in the background and images section where you

19
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.620
will learn a lot about how you can control that images and background images look exactly the way you

20
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.160
want, to be precise you will learn how you can center this and so on, really cool stuff.

21
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.820
For now, this does it though,

22
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.460
looks way better,

23
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.250
the next goal will be to work on the remaining sections of our starting page.

24
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.030
We'll dive into this in the next course module.
