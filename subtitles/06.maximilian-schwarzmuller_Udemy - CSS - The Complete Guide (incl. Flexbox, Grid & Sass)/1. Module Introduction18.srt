Welcome to this module. In this course, up until now, we talked about CSS which I guess makes sense if

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:16,670
you consider the course title. Now in this module, we'll have a look at SASS though. SASS as you will learn

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,820
is a superset to CSS,

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:25,640
so basically a language based on CSS which is not understood by the browser. We'll still make it work

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,900
and I will show you how it works, I'll of course also explain why using SASS over SCSS could be beneficial

6
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,440
and how it still relates to CSS.

7
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,090
So let's dive right into this,

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,640
let's find out what SASS is,

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,890
let's install it and let's work with it.
