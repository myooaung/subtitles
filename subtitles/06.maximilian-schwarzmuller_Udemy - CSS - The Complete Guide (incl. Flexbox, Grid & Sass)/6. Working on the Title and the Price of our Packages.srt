1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,710
So let's work on the title and the price of these elements

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:14,860
and for that, I'll add more classes to my HTML code. For the title, so free, plus and premium, I'll add a

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,170
class of plan__title and for the price,

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,330
unsurprisingly I add plan__price.

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,700
Now of course, these classes have to be added to all plans,

6
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:37,750
so the title to all the titles and the price obviously to all the prices we got here and for the last

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,860
plan.

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,710
With that added, we can again jump back to the main.css file and add some styling and I will

9
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,730
add it above

10
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:52,600
the plan features class selector, simply because in HTML, the title and the price come prior to the

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,470
features.

12
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:02,600
So now with that, here we can add the plan__title selector and set let's say the

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,910
color of the text to a darker green, maybe the same dark green we used before on our page.

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,220
If we now save this, this looks a bit more like value

15
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,210
in my opinion though, so I like the look of that.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,110
Now the price, that's all is something we can change or where we might want to change the style,

17
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:34,710
I will add a plan__price selector here and set it to maybe a grey-ish color.

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,670
So maybe let's start with color, this grey 

19
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,740
maybe is not dark enough, so let's pick a different one,

20
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,050
maybe go there

21
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,430
and by the way, if you're using Visual Studio Code, you can click on that rgb function to also get the hex

22
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,340
code version of that if you want, of course doesn't really matter,

23
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,250
you can use either of the two.

24
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,060
We then reload,

25
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,890
that looks nice but not in the highlighted plan. In the highlighted plan,

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,860
this price especially is not looking that great,

27
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,020
so let's go back and let's change the style for the highlighted plan price.

28
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,650
So for the plan highlighted, plan price,

29
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,950
now I'm using a combinator to target only the planned price classes in an element which

30
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,920
has the plan highlighted class.

31
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,570
There, maybe the better color for the price

32
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,170
also is that dark green.

33
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,300
Now since this is also the same color we used for the title,

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:46,660
we could also change the title. So I will again use plan highlighted but now together with the title

35
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,640
and change the color of the title

36
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:58,410
maybe to just white. So with these two changed styles for plan title and price in highlighted plans, if we

37
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,700
reload,

38
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,520
this looks better in my opinion,

39
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,680
this really leads to a better style of our plan.

40
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,270
With these things added, I'm liking the general look,

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,530
the buttons are things we can still work on and you also maybe notice that whilst everything is aligned

42
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:23,070
in the middle, the left and the right plan don't have an equal height which makes sense because the

43
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:29,050
left plan actually has a line break for this text here whereas the right one doesn't.

44
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:35,910
Now with the current toolset, it's not that easy to achieve that they all have the same height.

45
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,580
We could set the height property,

46
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:46,140
the problem just is that on bigger devices where this fits into one line, we'll have a lot of empty

47
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,250
space in this box thereafter

48
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:55,110
since the height is set to a fixed height but the content height changes depending on how many

49
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:01,830
line breaks we need. We'll later in the course learn about flex box, a tool which makes that much easier,

50
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:09,240
which allows us to really position the elements in a way that their height is equal and still looks

51
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:15,210
good when it comes to their content, that their content is centered vertically then and that you overall

52
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,430
can style this in a more appealing way.

53
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,760
So for now, this is what we'll work with

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,030
but be aware that we will change

55
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,490
this throughout the course, we're not stuck with this result.

56
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,390
So with that, let's move on and let's work on the button in the next lecture.
