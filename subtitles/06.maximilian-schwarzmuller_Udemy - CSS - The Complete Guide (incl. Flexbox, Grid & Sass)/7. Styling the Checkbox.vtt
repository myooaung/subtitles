00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.140
So let's work on this checkbox now

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:12.480
and first of all, I want to ensure that these styles here which target all inputs, which includes the checkbox,

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.810
do not target the checkbox,

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.290
I don't want it.

5
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:26.500
So what I will do here is, I will go to this input selector here and actually add the not pseudo selector,

6
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:35.470
not allow us to say that it should target all inputs which do not fulfill the requirement we add here

7
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.860
inside of the parentheses

8
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.240
and that requirement just is another selector.

9
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.970
So here, I will actually add another attribute selector with square brackets, type equals checkbox.

10
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.400
So all in inputs which are not of type checkbox will receive these styles

11
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.910
and on the other hand, the checkbox will not receive them and that's exactly what I want.

12
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.810
Now we can also add that to our signup-form input down there, in front of the focus pseudo selector

13
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.370
and with that, everything should work as before

14
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.510
and we don't see a visual difference but if you inspect your checkbox, you'll see that it doesn't get

15
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.190
the default input styles other than display block and so on which it should get,

16
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.360
it doesn't get the other ones though.

17
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.410
So with that, we're ready to restyle it

18
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.940
and how do we do that?

19
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.930
Well for that, we need to select the checkbox. We already saw how we could do this here, 

20
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.010
let me copy that selector and add it again, maybe here in front of the button

21
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.040
and just to mix things up, I'll use type equals checkbox here, just to prove that this also

22
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.750
works and in there, we can change its look.

23
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:56.060
Now what we can do for example is, we could give it a border of one pixel solid and also this light

24
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.700
grey

25
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.690
we got on all our inputs. We could add a background,

26
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.680
let's set it to white and maybe give it a width of 1rem and a height of 1rem.

27
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.830
So I'm basically building a box here,

28
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.310
keep in mind our checkbox is of type display inline block, so we can build it as a box.

29
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.520
I build a box which has a border white background and it's 1rem wide and high.

30
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.450
If we do that and we save that and we reload, it increased in size

31
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.250
but I don't see a white background,

32
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.550
I don't see my border,

33
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.810
we still got that default style.

34
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.960
However it clearly does receive our styles as we can confirm if we select it, here

35
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.020
all the styles are applied.

36
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.480
Now the thing is, just as the select, the checkbox is a special type of input.

37
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.320
If we scroll down to its browser default styles, we see that it gets this webkit appearance style which

38
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.390
sets it to checkbox. For the select by the way, we can also see webkit appearance menu list.

39
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.330
These are important default styles that defined that

40
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.970
the select has these errors and works like this and that the checkbox works like this.

41
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.730
If you want to change that, you have to overwrite it.

42
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.430
Now this would also be possible for the select dropdown but I want to do it on the checkbox since that's

43
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.780
a bit more interesting in my opinion.

44
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.870
So let's overwrite it by setting that -webkit appearance style.

45
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.760
Now don't be irritated by that leading dash here,

46
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.090
this is a valid property name,

47
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.300
it's looking strange because it's a browser a specific one,

48
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.430
it's not the same in all browsers and that's why it's starting with a dash

49
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.910
and we should set it to none, to disable that default.

50
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.010
If we now save that and reload,

51
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.190
now we got the new style and now we can't check it actually.

52
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.620
We'll work on that,

53
00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:02.190
we got our style at least. Now as I said, this is browser specific, so we should also add Moz's appearance,

54
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.280
which is actually the attribute required by Mozilla to overwrite the default look there too

55
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.440
and let's add appearance in general and set it to none,

56
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.710
this will also help all browsers to understand that and they don't have their browser default or

57
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:21.760
actually, it would overwrite the browser default here if also understands this syntax.

58
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.810
So now we're forcing this checkbox to look the way we want it to look,

59
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.180
now before we continue styling it, one thing we can see is that it's now not inline or not centered,

60
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.340
vertically centered to the label.

61
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.070
So we can fix this by going up to our checkbox and label selector and setting vertical align to

62
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.770
middle,

63
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.580
let's try that,

64
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.250
let's save that and reload,

65
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.600
that looks better.

66
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.750
Now you could also try different values, like bottom for example which in this case in my opinion looks

67
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.650
even better

68
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.810
a tiny bit because now they're aligning at the bottom and I believe this looks better here.

69
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.410
Now one thing that's missing of course is our ability to check this and to see a difference.

70
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.760
It's important to understand that technically, this still can be checked.

71
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.520
So if I click in there, this actually behind the scenes is switching between being checked and not being

72
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.830
checked, we just don't see that here.

73
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.150
The reason for this is that no style is set for this being checked,

74
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.620
previously, the webkit appearance did this for us,

75
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.380
the default value is set by the browser but since we overwrote this to be none, we have to do it manually.

76
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:37.490
So let's again target signup-form input type equals checkbox or feel free to try out a different

77
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.620
selector here

78
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.080
and in there, now we use the checked pseudo class.

79
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.830
So as you see, you work a lot with pseudo classes when working with forms.

80
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.800
Now in here, we set the styles

81
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.070
we want to set for the check mode

82
00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:00.380
and there, I just want to set the background to my light green color and change the border to my dark

83
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.760
green color, which we also use in other places of the app,

84
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.720
for example here,

85
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:10.300
so this dark green. I'll copy that from the main header brand and enter it as a color here.

86
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:17.230
Now with that if we reload, we can actually check this as you see, the remaining part just is that I want

87
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.640
to get rid of that outline,

88
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:26.670
so when we're focusing this checkbox, I don't want to have an outline, so therefore maybe I just remove

89
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.900
that not selector from all the other inputs and see if that works the way I want it to work,

90
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.630
yes,

91
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.490
this now certainly looks better.

92
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.670
So now we get our custom checkbox here with our own style overwriting the default

93
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.590
and with that, we achieved a lot,

94
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.690
let's also check this on the mobile screen, that's looking good there too.

95
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.730
So now let's see what else we can do with that form.
