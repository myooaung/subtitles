1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,790
So throughout this module, we learned a lot about SASS.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,730
Now looking over our code, there are still some things we can improve or things that look like they could

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,910
still be improved.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,190
For one, I forgot that here, this h1 tag,

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:24,070
we could nest this into this section header to be in line with our other logic where we use nesting when

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,890
possible

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,490
and the same here for the paragraph in the sass-introduction, this also can be nested in here

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,130
and if you already did this earlier in this module, for example in the assignment,

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,730
good job.

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,470
This is more investing done but what else can we do?

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,790
Let's have a look at this hover and active thing,

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,830
doesn't this look a bit strange?

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,350
We've got all these nice improvements in place and still here it looks like we still have to manually

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:57,680
create this group of selectors, which is the same selector as here, just with a pseudo selector added.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,740
Well we can handle this with SASS too.

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,810
Now the first thought might be that you couldn't nest this, so that you can add hover and active like

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,880
this in your selector or in the documentation link selector.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:21,110
Now if you do that and you reload your page, you'll see that hovering has no effect anymore,

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,210
let's check out the created CSS code.

20
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:32,810
There you see that actually what it did is it created this, obviously as nested selectors,

21
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,620
so if we had other elements which are hoverable or active inside our documentation link,

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,160
then these styles would get applied to these elements but we don't have them,

23
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,130
so this doesn't work here.

24
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,920
Instead what we want to do is we want to apply hover and active to the documentation link, not nested

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,090
to it.

26
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,660
Now how do we do that? For this,

27
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,780
SASS has

28
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:03,010
the and, the ampersand operator. We add it in front of :hover and :active and then we still keep

29
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,290
it nested in documentation link.

30
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:12,730
This tells SASS that these pseudo selectors here and this does not only work with pseudo selectors, you

31
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:20,820
could also have a normal class of for example, that they should be connected to the element here rather

32
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,720
than nested inside of it.

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,580
So if we compile this and we go back to we main.css file, you'll see that the rule changed

34
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,290
and now it changed the documentation link with the hover effect or with active,

35
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:40,860
so now we have this connected selector here. And now with that, if we reload the page, it works again

36
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,880
and now we can hover again.

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,640
So this was one final improvement

38
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,660
I wanted to put into place because now, we got a really optimized and nice looking SCSS file where

39
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,010
we take advantage of the many features SASS gives us.
