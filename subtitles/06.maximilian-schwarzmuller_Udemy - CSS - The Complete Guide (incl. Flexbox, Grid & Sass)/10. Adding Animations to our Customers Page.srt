1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,860
Now that we have to look at the basics of animations, let's create one for another part of our page. On

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,170
the customers page,

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,240
let's make sure we can actually flip a customer if we hover over him. For that, 

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,900
I'll go to my customers.css

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,000
file

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,020
and first of all, I'll create the keyframes for the animation, just as we learned it,

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,630
that's always the first step.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,820
So we use @keyframes to create our keyframes set and I'll name it FlipCustomer or whichever name

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,420
you want to assign to that animation.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,390
Then here, I want to use three keyframes

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,800
and of course you can tweak this just as you desire.

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,970
I want to use transform again, as you saw, you often use transform when you play around with animations

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,850
or transitions simply because transitions and animations often are about moving things

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,000
and here, I want to rotate the customer on the y-axis but start at zero.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,980
Now I will also add a second keyframe and transform my rotation again

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,820
but now I want to transform to let's say 160 degrees,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,890
so I want to completely flip the customer and this is almost at the point where we flip it half. With

18
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,440
180 degree, we would see the back side of the customer perfectly

19
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,300
but I want to play this a little bit slower,

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,640
so at 50% of the animation, we didn't entirely complete half the flip yet

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,820
but then at 100%, I of course want to complete the flip and I do so by adding transform rotateY here,

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,790
360 degrees.

23
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,870
Now with that, we get the keyframe set and

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,310
now of course we just need to add it somewhere and to add it somewhere, I'll go up to my customers and

25
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,410
I'll actually create a new selector.

26
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,080
Our customers have an ID,

27
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,710
customer one has an ID of customer-1.

28
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,830
So I'll use that ID selector here,

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,760
maybe here, doesn't matter,

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,430
customer 1 and listen to a hover or use that hover pseudo selector

31
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,040
but then I actually want to animate a nested element,

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,290
I want to animate the image container, I want to flip the image, not the entire customer. So there I'll

33
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,260
target testimonial image container.

34
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,760
So whenever I hover over the customer block, then I want to adjust the style for the image container

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,070
and here I want to play my animation, 

36
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,680
FlipCustomer,

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,690
that's the keyframe set

38
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:34,950
we just added, over one second let's say, maybe with an ease out timing function and I want to keep the

39
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,190
ending state with forwards.

40
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,640
Now if we save that and we reload the page, you can already see it, if we hover over the customer, it flips

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,090
but the skewness is messed up as you can see.

42
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:56,430
So this is something we can fix by going down to our keyframes again and now by animating more than one

43
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,540
property,

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,990
I also want to animate the skewness and since this also is a transform value,

45
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,950
I'll simply add the skew function here and now it's 20 degrees by which I skewed the container.

46
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:15,420
This now stays constant in all my keyframes because I never want to change the skewness, though if you

47
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,490
want to create a really fancy effect, play around with that too and you will probably get a crazy animation.

48
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,490
Now with that, let's go back and let's reload the page

49
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:30,690
and now actually the skewness is kept when we rotate that image, only of customer 1 by the way because

50
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,340
we only added the effect there.

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,030
Now on a mobile device by the way, you don't see this,

52
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,770
you have to click on it to trigger that and then click somewhere else because there is no hovering on

53
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,590
mobile devices of course.

54
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,760
This is working the way I want it to work

55
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,090
and it shows that of course you can animate more than one property value-pair. Here we're animating

56
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,610
two

57
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,040
and we're even keeping one constant to ensure that we don't mess up our skewness

58
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,820
in this case.
