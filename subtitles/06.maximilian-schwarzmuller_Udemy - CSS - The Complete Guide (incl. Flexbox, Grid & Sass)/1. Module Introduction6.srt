00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,570
Welcome to this module. So we're diving deeper and deeper into CSS,

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:13,080
so right now is the time to have a look at a really special property, the position property which as

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:19,580
the name says right here, allows us to change the position of elements on our website because so far, we've

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,880
worked with the display property for example and we saw that this allows us to change the default behavior

5
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,420
of the way our elements are displayed,

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,850
so block level, inline and inline block for example

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:39,060
but with the position property, we can really change the actual position of an element on our website.

8
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,380
So what will you learn throughout this module?

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,840
Well, we will first of course understand the position property, how it works, what it does and why we can

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,670
use it to,

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,000
well as I said, position the elements on our website.

12
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:59,480
After that, we will learn how to create fixed navigation bars with a specific value for this position properties,

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:06,590
the fixed value. After we understood and apply this fixed value, we will learn another property in connection

14
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,770
with the position property, the so-called z-index which will allow us to position our elements along

15
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,260
the z-axis on our website.

16
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,120
Why this is important and really helpful, we will find out all that in this module. After we've worked with the

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,780
z-index, we will have a look at two more values that we can apply to our position property because

18
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,400
so far, we had a look at the fixed value

19
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,530
but then it's time to have a look at absolute and relative.

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,130
We will have a look at these values standalone and in combination because as it will turn out, there

21
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:47,390
are some nice situations where the specific characteristics of these values can be easily combined to make

22
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,650
positioning a lot easier. After that, we'll have a look at the last value,

23
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,700
the sticky positioning. Just like fixed, absolute and relative,

24
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,030
this is also a value that can be applied to the position property and this is a rather new value,

25
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,450
so we will see that there are some limitations when using it but having a look and that general understanding

26
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,370
of it definitely makes sense.

27
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,750
After that, we will wrap up this module with the so-called stacking context.

28
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,830
This is something that is connected to the z-index and this is a concept we might not use on a

29
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:29,490
daily basis but understanding the theoretical concept behind it is definitely important and can make

30
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,380
your lives a lot easier if you work with the position property.

31
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,590
And this is actually what you will learn throughout this module,

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,000
so why don't we just start right now and have a look at the position property,

33
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,150
what is that actually?
