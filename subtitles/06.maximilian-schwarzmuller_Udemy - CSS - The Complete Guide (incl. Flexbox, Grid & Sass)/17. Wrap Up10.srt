00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,200
So throughout this module, we had a look at a lot of SASS features in our code here.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,730
You learned about variables,

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,750
nesting, mixins,

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,310
partials, the different import syntax and so on.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,790
Now I can only encourage you to dive deeper into the topics which are linked in this project, as well

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,160
as simply on the official SASS page.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:29,300
There you can learn more about SASS and more about how you can use it and add it to your workflow

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,410
and that's also important,

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,250
you'll not always use the SASS command line tool as we did here. In a lot of projects where you use webpack

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:38,910
anyway

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,690
for example, you can implement SASS loader and that is now really beyond the scope of this module here

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,780
but you can implement tools that integrate with webpack that will do that SASS compilation as part of

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,790
your regular build workflow.

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,100
So this is also available,

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,870
you don't have to use the SASS command line tool we used here. But it's a great place to get started

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,480
and I want to encourage you to keep on practicing SASS and playing around with it

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,460
since this really is a more fun way of creating CSS, at least for a lot of people including myself.
