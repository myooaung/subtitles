00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.440
Welcome to this module.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.480
So we added the form in the last lecture,

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.260
now it's time to dive deeper into text and fonts.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.670
We already use a custom font we could say from Google fonts,

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.640
that's the font we imported earlier in this course

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.920
but I think we should dive deeper right here and see what we can do with text and fonts in CSS.

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.970
So what will we cover in this module?

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.230
Well, we will start and have a look at the difference between a generic and a font family. After we understood

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.820
that, we will see how we can use and import font families.

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.410
We saw that we did that with Google fonts already,

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.580
we will also dive deeper into that but we'll also see that we have other options to use and import

12
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.090
font families in

13
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.200
CSS and by that, on our website.

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.820
In addition to that, we'll have a look at a lot of different font properties.

15
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.460
So we will see which properties we have, what impact they have and how we can use them.

16
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.970
Finally, we'll also have a look at the font shorthand, which kind of lets us combine multiple properties

17
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.840
in one single property.

18
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.210
So that's what's inside this module,

19
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.180
let's start now with a theoretical look at generic and font families.
