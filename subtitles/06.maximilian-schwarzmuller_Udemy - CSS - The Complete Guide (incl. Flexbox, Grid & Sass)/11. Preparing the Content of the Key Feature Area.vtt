00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.780
So did you find some nice styles?

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.640
Let's work on these bullet points together

3
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.290
and for that I'll start the HTML code and first of all assign some classes. I'll start with the unordered

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:21.640
list element and there I'll assign a class which I'll name key-feature__list,

5
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.010
of

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.510
course you can pick any class name you want.

7
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.830
Now the individual list item will also receive a class

8
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.680
and this actually is my individual key feature, so this will just be a key feature because this is

9
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.880
just one key feature element.

10
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.950
You could name it key feature element but in my opinion, key feature already is a fitting name for the

11
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.860
element itself.

12
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:59.560
Now in there, I will also assign a class to the text and I will give it a class of key-feature__description

13
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.180
.

14
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.620
Now with that, we have to apply these classes to the other key features too,

15
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:15.660
so the key feature class to the other list items and the key-feature__description class to the other paragraphs

16
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.680
in my key features. So with that, the classes are added,

17
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.220
now it's time to work on the styles. For this,

18
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.760
I will add a style for the list, key-feature__list was the class we applied to

19
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.090
that,

20
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.330
so that's the unordered list element and I want to remove the list cells so let it set it to none and

21
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.120
add a margin of 0 and a padding of 0.

22
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.190
Next, the key feature itself, key-feature. Here

23
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.510
I now want to set the display to inline block again to make sure that all key features are in one

24
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.940
line and I'll give it a width of 30%

25
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.310
and by the way, why not 33?

26
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.060
Because of the inline block bug, 

27
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.060
not really a bug but of that behavior where whitespace in between

28
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.380
also gets a width and therefore 33% would actually not fill the entire width but a little bit

29
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.850
more and hence we would have an ugly line break, with 30%

30
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.060
we should be safe. Now with that if we save that and reload,

31
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.400
the elements are sitting next to each other, 

32
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.900
they're not centered at all though, so that probably is something we want to change too

33
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.140
and we can change it on the list, since the key features are inline elements, we can target them with text

34
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.590
align center because that centers text, that centers inline elements to be precise and therefore if

35
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.800
we now reload,

36
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.370
it's nicely centered, it's looking good.

37
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.900
Now of course one other thing I want to do is I want to change the text from a visual perspective too.

38
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.430
So my key feature is styled like this,

39
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.530
the key-feature__description should get a special style too,

40
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.350
so that's the text itself, the description. Here

41
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.500
I want to also center a text inside of its box to make sure everything is perfectly centered and I

42
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.960
will assign a font weight of bold as well as a white color

43
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.200
and finally, why don't we increase the font size a little bit,

44
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.380
maybe to 20 pixels.

45
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.330
If we do that and we reload, it's looking good.

46
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.850
What we can see is that here we get a little line break issue, that goes away if we increase the page

47
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.220
width of course. For now it's something we'll simply live with because on smaller screens, we'll have it

48
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.050
anyways,

49
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.100
we will take care about this later in the course too and we'll make sure that everything is positioned

50
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.900
nicely.

51
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.800
Well one thing we can already do is we can go back and assign a different style for key feature, we can

52
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.010
said vertical align to top here,

53
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.440
this should ensure that all the key feature texts are aligned at the top which in my opinion looks a

54
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.140
bit better than if the line break is somewhere in the middle.

55
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.810
So with that, we got nice key features but an image above each feature would be nice.

56
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.270
Now we'll add images in the backgrounds and images section,

57
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.370
for now let's already prepare a container for the image,

58
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.780
let's add a circle above each text which for now simply has a background color.

59
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.890
Now to add such a circle, we got that div,

60
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:32.080
it's not there by accident. We can add a class to that div and I will name this key-feature__image

61
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.860
because eventually, this will hold an image.

62
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.450
Let's assign that class to all the divs and all the key features and then in the CSS code here,

63
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.300
I'll add a style for it above my description because in HTML it comes above that, 

64
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.410
key-feature__image

65
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.080
and now as I said, the image will follow.

66
00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:07.490
For now what I'll do is I'll assign a background, maybe a light reddish color, we can use #ffcede here,

67
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:18.800
so like rose color. I'll add a width here, let's say of 128 pixels.

68
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:27.970
I'll also give it a border of let's say 2 pixels solid and a dark grey, maybe

69
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.650
#424242

70
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.890
and now to turn this into a circle,

71
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:39.340
we have to set a border radius of course to turn the edges to rounded corners and to get a perfect circle,

72
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.550
you actually have to use 50% here,

73
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:50.180
this will round everything such that you exactly get a perfect circle in the end.

74
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.450
If we save that and we reload,

75
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.600
we got that

76
00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:00.300
here, the problem now is we got no height on that image, so we need to add height to it too. The height

77
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.820
to get a perfect circle has to match the width, so that you have a square and then you round the corners,

78
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.840
wo we add 128 pixels as a height,

79
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.630
now we got a circle

80
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.340
and now I want to center that circle horizontally.

81
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.080
There's a nice trick you can use with the margin property.

82
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.180
You can set margin to left and right but how do you know how much margin you need to set to center this?

83
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:32.480
Well you can just set margin auto or zero auto because it only matters to left and right but doesn't

84
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:39.440
hurt if you set it into all directions and auto will automatically fill the available space to the left

85
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.340
and right equally to center the element horizontally.

86
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.200
Not vertically,

87
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.080
that does not work

88
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.830
but horizontally works,

89
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:53.990
so margin auto will now center that circle and eventually, we'll add an image to that circle as I

90
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.490
said.

91
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.920
And now with that, we got our key feature area in a good shape, images are missing but will be

92
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.910
added.

93
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.420
I like the look of that a lot,

94
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.000
I think we're building a nice starting page for our hosting service.

95
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.660
The next thing we'll add is a footer at the bottom,

96
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.600
so let's do that in the next lecture.
