00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,160
So what have we learned about flexbox and about how to use it?

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,800
Well generally, we learned that with flexbox, we can easily change the way our elements are displayed

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:18,570
on a website. Specifically, flexbox includes the flex container, so this parent element and the items

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,190
inside this container.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,860
the so-called flex items. Then we were diving deeper into that and had a look at the flex container

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:33,750
which was created by adding the display flex or inline flex, that's also possible, declaration to an element

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,250
and this element will then be turned into such a flex container.

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,550
Now regarding the properties we can apply to such a flex container,

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,420
we of course have the display flex or inline flex property.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,460
We also had flex direction which basically defined the way our elements are displayed,

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,170
so remember we had row, row reverse, column and column reverse.

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,880
We also saw that we can define how the elements should wrap,

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,860
so with wrap and no wrap for the flex wrap property, we could change the behavior and the shorthand for

14
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,000
these two properties was flex flow,

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,670
so the first value for the flex flow is the flex direction,

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,970
the second value is the flex wrap.

17
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:20,370
We then had different properties which allowed us to change the behavior of all the flex items inside

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,500
our flex container. With align items, we could align our items in relation to the cross axis, justify

19
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,680
content allowed us to do the same thing along the main axis. With align content,

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,890
we were allowed to define the behavior along the cross axis again, that's important, in case our elements

21
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,200
are wrapped over two or more lines.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,730
When talking about these properties, we of course also had a look at the main axis versus the cross

23
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,780
axis.

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,420
We learned that flex direction basically defines the main axis,

25
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,360
so if this is the row or the column and the properties we applied to our flex container are also dependent

26
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:11,370
on the main axis and the cross axis we had which therefore also meant that the behavior of the flex

27
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:18,830
items that is coming with the properties we used is also highly dependent on the flex direction property.

28
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,960
We then also had a look at the flex items because in contrast to the properties we added to the flex

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:33,300
container which affected all flex items, the flex item specific properties allowed us to change the

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,710
behavior of individual flex items.

31
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,320
Therefore, we also had a look at the different properties related to the flex items, we talked about order

32
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,050
which allows us to, well as the name says, changed the order of the flex items along the cross or main

33
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,990
axis.

34
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:56,370
We talked about align self which is kind of like align item, so which allows us to position an element

35
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,530
in relation to the cross axis

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,790
but this time for a specific flex item, for the individual flex item and then we talked about flex, so the

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,500
flex shorthand which combines flex grow, flex shrink and flex basis and that's actually it.

38
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,360
This is actually all the core knowledge that we have now to work with flexbox

39
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:25,160
and as we saw in our project, to make our project a bit more leaner and easier to use and maintain.

40
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,990
So this is the end of this module

41
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:36,030
and with that, I will now hand over to Max again who will show you another, maybe more advanced concept

42
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:42,060
of changing the way our elements behave and are displayed, the CSS grid.

43
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,960
So let's find out what that is, how it works and especially how we can apply it to our project in the next

44
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,480
module.
