1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:07,520
So why do we have to position our elements or how does it work so far actually?

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,730
Well, to understand this, we can imagine the following 

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,560
HTML and body elements

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:19,890
and inside this body element we have three divs for example, three block level elements in our case

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,960
and as we know, the general behavior of these block level elements is the way it is displayed right here,

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:32,890
occupying the entire space available in the row where they are positioned and because of that, being

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,480
displayed one after another.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,970
This basically is due to the fact that these are block level elements and that these elements are following

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:49,380
the document flow which is basically the flow of a normal HTML document that we have right here.

10
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:57,460
Now the question is, is there already some property applied automatically maybe which makes sure that this

11
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,800
document flow is followed or will be followed by the elements?

12
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:08,830
The answer is yes it is, the position property is applied automatically or by default 

13
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:15,420
in our HTML code, specifically a value for this position property of static is applied.

14
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,370
As I said, this is the default value,

15
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,000
so if you specify nothing,

16
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,270
this is what happens

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:28,750
and this will basically lead to the case that we saw so far on a website and also to the situation that

18
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,920
we can see on the left,

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,600
so basically everything works as intended.

20
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:39,430
Now there might be situations where you want to change this normal document flow of your elements,

21
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,540
what could that mean?

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,960
Well for example, it might be the case that you want to position this first div right here in the right

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,250
upper part or right

24
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:55,270
upper corner of the HTML element or you might want to position the second div in the left upper corner of

25
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,350
the body element.

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,100
Now that's of course just some examples,

27
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:06,530
basically you could want to position any element on more or less any position on your website.

28
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,780
Now this is actually possible but not with this default value,

29
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:22,650
for that you have to specify a position property with a value of absolute, relative, fixed or sticky.

30
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,700
Now sticky is great out right here because sticky is a rather new value for this property and therefore

31
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,610
the browser support is not the best,

32
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,310
nevertheless we'll of course have a look at it and see how it works

33
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,210
but the general takeaway of this slide is that we need the position property in combination with a value

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,320
different, that's really important, different from the default value which is static to be able to change

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,460
the actual position of our elements on the website.

36
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:59,880
That's not everything of course because with that, with these values, we just specify that we want to

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,040
change the position

38
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,480
but we of course also have to specify how we want to change the position,

39
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:12,430
so where are these elements should be displayed. For that, we must think about some additional concepts.

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,190
To understand these concepts,

41
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:22,520
we can again imagine our website like this and now focus onto this element right here because let's say

42
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,760
that we apply the position property for this element with a value that is not equal to static,

43
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,530
keep that in mind already.

44
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,130
Now with that, we basically told our element, hey come on move to another position

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,670
and the element probably asked ok but where should I move to and for that, we have four different options.

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:50,810
We have top and bottom and we have left and right. Now of course we could also use this in a combination

47
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,030
like top and left, bottom and right or maybe all of these depending on what you want to achieve on the

48
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,020
website,

49
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:02,540
the important thing is that with these properties, these are our properties so top, right, bottom, left, 

50
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,350
with these properties,

51
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,650
you change the position of the elements in your document flow,

52
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,510
that's important.

53
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,030
So these properties refer to the initial position in the document flow,

54
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,160
that's the first thing

55
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,400
but there is one other important concept that we have to understand because if we apply top 20 pixels

56
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,240
now to our elements right here,

57
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,580
well what does this mean,

58
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,800
what do these 20 pixels top refer to?

59
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,260
Well there are different options.

60
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,440
One option will be that this declaration refers to the element itself.

61
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,400
What does this mean?

62
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,430
Well basically it says please take the current position of my element and move it up by 20 pixels,

63
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,150
one option that we could have and we'll have a look at that of course.

64
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:55,550
Another option could be though that the 20 pixels refer to a distance for example,

65
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:04,460
so let's say it should be 20 pixels from the top of our viewport or of our HTML element, of our

66
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,470
body element or of more or less any other element.

67
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,340
So as you can see, we have a lot of options right here

68
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,230
and all these options refer to the so-called positioning context.

69
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,720
So this basically means, what does my positioning change that I want to achieve refer to?

70
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,210
So that's the pure theory,

71
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:33,110
let's now get a little bit more into a practical example, not by jumping back to our website immediately

72
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,250
but by going to an intermediate project,

73
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,650
so kind of a hybrid between theory and practice and play around with the property. Specifically,

74
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:49,550
I would like to show you what the exact behavior of the static value and especially of the fixed value

75
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,190
is.

76
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,490
So let's find that out in the next video.
