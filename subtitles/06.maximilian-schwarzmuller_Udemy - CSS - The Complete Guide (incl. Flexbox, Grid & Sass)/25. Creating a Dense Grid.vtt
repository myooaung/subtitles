00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.790
Now we're almost done with the grid,

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.430
there's one more thing which can come in handy though. If we go back to our main.css file, let's position

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.530
one element slightly different.

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.980
Please note that the featured quote, which is this quote here, takes two columns

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.230
as a width, so it spans two columns I should say,

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.890
now let's move the quote which we select with env of type,

7
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.420
so to select a second element with the quote class essentially which is the first element after the

8
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.350
featured quote,

9
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:45.410
so we're selecting this quote now and if I there set grid column to span two to also turn this into

10
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.360
a wider element and I set auto-fill here to three instead,

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.910
so to have three columns of 10rem, if we now reload, we can see something interesting.

12
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.680
The top right element here, the top right cell is not occupied, there is no value, no element in it.

13
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.140
The reason for this is this normally would be the place of this second element here,

14
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.200
the quote where we just increased it to span two columns.

15
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.170
Now the other quotes after it don't jump into that empty space because the DOM order is respected here,

16
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.210
unless we position an element explicitly with grid row and column,

17
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.450
so if we were to position that element where we just changed the width

18
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.580
basically, if we were to position this specifically in a certain position by assigning line names or

19
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.960
numbers or an area, if we were to do that, then the element after it would actually take the empty space

20
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.090
but if we don't do this, if we only increase this to span more than one cell, then the cell which it

21
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.970
would have normally gotten will stay empty.

22
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.130
You can overwrite this behavior by going back to grid auto flow, the property on the grid container and

23
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.790
by adding dense here, this is also available for a column,

24
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:13.290
so if you're setting auto flow to column, column then also exists. What dense does is it will overwrite

25
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.880
this default behavior of not taking the free space here

26
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.990
and if you therefore reload, now you see there is a quote in that space and that is not the quote which

27
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.420
would have normally gotten that space.

28
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.620
One important note about this behavior though,

29
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.710
you can use it to densely organize your grid and to ensure that there are no empty spaces

30
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.530
but please be aware that this may not be optimal.

31
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.380
You can run into accessibility errors here because the screen readers will read your page from top to

32
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.970
bottom, so the DOM order is what they respect and they will read items as they appear in the DOM.

33
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.550
If you change the visuals to move them around, the thing people with screen readers will get out of their

34
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.050
page

35
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.900
is different to what other people can get out of your page.

36
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.810
So this is something to keep in mind,

37
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.860
changing the order visually only is not always recommended,

38
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.430
it is something you should do with great care.

39
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.890
It is possible though if your requirement is to not leave any empty spaces and if you want to ensure

40
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
that therefore your grid is as dense as possible.
