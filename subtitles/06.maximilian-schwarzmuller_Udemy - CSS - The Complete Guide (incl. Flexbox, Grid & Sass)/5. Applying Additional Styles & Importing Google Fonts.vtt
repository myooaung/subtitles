1
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:09.110
We added the first styles to our website and this already improves the look a little bit, at least it

2
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.690
did something on the screen

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.280
but beautiful still is different I'd say.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.020
So for one, we should style different things like our font we use,

5
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.480
I don't think this font is very beautiful and maybe the color of the text as well and the positioning

6
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.600
of the text in this surrounding area maybe is also something we can change.

7
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.040
So these are the next things we want to do.

8
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.200
Additionally I also don't want to use the same styles on both sections because both sections will actually

9
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.730
have very different purposes and styles in our web page.

10
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.830
So these are the two things I want to focus on next, how we can change different things than just the

11
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.660
background,

12
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.890
so how we can for example change that text inside of that background or in that element having that background

13
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.970
and how we can apply different styles to different sections.

14
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:09.350
So let's start with the different styles thing because that instantly yields a nice effect

15
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.270
and let's say we want to change the font family,

16
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.920
so the way the font looks like as well as the color of this h1 tag.

17
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.290
Now for this what we can do is, we can add a new selector to our CSS file and in this case, it would

18
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.720
be the h1 selector because we want to change the text in this h1 element,

19
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.080
so I guess it makes sense to use that h1 selector.

20
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.020
Now we again add the curly braces and now we did change the background in the past of the entire section

21
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.070
actually,

22
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.460
now I want to change things about that

23
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.600
h1 tag, about the text itself and the two things I mentioned were the color and the font family.

24
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.840
Now let's start with the color, you change the color of the text with the color property

25
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.310
and again if you're wondering how I know that, by experience, because as I mentioned, you work with the

26
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.990
same set of properties a lot and I will also show you that reference I was talking about

27
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.460
but for now let's just use color here and let's set a color of white for now. If we save that and we reload

28
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.880
the page, we see all,

29
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.430
so both h1 tags turned white which again makes a lot of sense because with the h1 selector, we select

30
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.060
all and not just one h1 element.

31
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.360
So this is for now at least one change, we did set the color to something different, to white in our case

32
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.960
but there still is more we can do,

33
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.630
I was talking about changing the font.

34
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.830
So for this, we need to change the font family, so you can go to that h1 tag and add font-family

35
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.210
as an additional property. This changes, well

36
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.790
you guessed it, the font family of this, so of this h1 tag

37
00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:01.500
and now here, you've got a couple of choices, you can use a default font family, like sans-serif.

38
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.570
This is a special keyword which will use the default set up in your browser.

39
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.840
If you reload the page, you'll see indeed the style did change.

40
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.470
Now where is this coming from?

41
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.640
Now for this, we should open our browser preferences. In these preferences and that of course depends

42
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.310
on your browser but in Chrome, you've got the customize fonts area and each browser should have something

43
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.000
like this.

44
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.550
If you click it, you'll see some custom settings about your fonts

45
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.380
and now here's the interesting part,

46
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.560
you also see a standard font which is used by default, that was the font you saw at the beginning, times

47
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.950
in my case,

48
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.670
then you've got a font with serif,

49
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.950
so you're saying I want a serif font or if you want a sans-serif font, it'll use Helvetica in my case

50
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.760
and that of course may differ on your system.

51
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.470
Fixed width is an additional default which you often use for code snippets, you always see a preview of

52
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.480
the font below the dropdown, at least in Chrome.

53
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.770
So these are the default settings and you target them by either not assigning a font family which will

54
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:13.620
use the standard font, by setting it to serif, to sans-serif or here this would be monospace actually

55
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.310
but more on this in a special section later in the course.

56
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:24.200
So for now what we did is we set it to sans-serif and hence in my case, it uses Helvetica and therefore

57
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.760
we get a different look already.

58
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.650
Now you're not limited to using font families included on your system,

59
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.090
however sans-serif, 

60
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.710
serif and monospace are always great values because they will use the browser defaults.

61
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.360
So you can rely on these keywords picking a font that looks at least to some extent in the way you want

62
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.820
because you can ensure it's a sans-serif or serif font as you fallback to the browser default for that

63
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.880
kind of font.

64
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.570
Sometimes you want a specific font though and you can't rely on that font being installed on the machine

65
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.370
of the user,

66
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.950
so to include a font which is not necessarily install ready, you can use a tool called Google Fonts.

67
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.840
If you search for Google fonts, you should find this result here, fonts.google.com

68
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:14.480
and on this page, you can see a lot of fonts which you can easily include on any web

69
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.170
page.

70
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:22.040
Now I already found one which I want to use for this project, so let's search for anton and here and

71
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.590
anton looks like this. Now you can add it to your project by clicking the plus which will open this part here

72
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.360
at the bottom

73
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:35.640
and if you expand this, you'll see two things, an import link which you need to add to your HTML head

74
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.920
section and the rule by which you can apply this font.

75
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.780
So let's grab the import link,

76
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.040
let's go to our index.html

77
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.880
file and add it above

78
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.480
our main.css import here, so that we can use that font in the main.css file

79
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.890
and thereafter, let's use font family,

80
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.720
so let's copy that rule and in our main.css file,

81
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.850
let's replace this font family declaration here with that.

82
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.980
So if we now save that and we leave google fonts and we reload the page, you'll see that the fonts changed once

83
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.320
again because now we're using that externally imported font

84
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.930
and since we're dynamically importing it with that link, you can rely on it being loaded on any machine

85
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.590
for any of your users.

86
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.980
So this is how we change the color and the font family.

87
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.810
This in my opinion improved the look, though it would also be nice to have some spacing inside of that

88
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.930
box and on the other hand, maybe get rid of that spacing around it and it would be nice if we didn't share

89
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.020
the styles between the two sections because as I mentioned, they should look different.

90
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.560
So that's a lot of work,

91
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.430
let's start with different styles for the different sections.
