1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,410
So that's it for the module,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,450
what did we learn?

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,290
We had a detailed look at the background property with all its subproperties and also how you could

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,830
combine them into the background shorthand. Important,

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,890
watch out for position and size which should be separated

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,100
with a slash, also make sure you separate multiple backgrounds correctly with commas

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,670
and as for all shorthands, you should always remember that you overwrite other properties when setting a

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:37,450
shorthand because the shorthand, even if you only use it to define a URL, will also initialize default

9
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,220
values for all the other subproperties.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,660
So if you add a shorthand as a last declaration in a rule and use set background position let's say earlier,

11
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,130
this will actually be overwritten by the default implied by the shorthand notation.

12
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:58,270
We then had a look at gradients, at linear and radial gradients and how you could control color stops,

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,500
shape, position and size of the gradients.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,990
We had a look at multiple backgrounds, how you can stack them, how the syntax works and that you can only

15
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:15,220
have one solid color but multiple images and that gradients count as images and that you can use transparency

16
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,590
to create cool effects.

17
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,990
We also had a look at how we can style images and I also did a brief comparison to background images

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,280
and mentioned the accessibility problem we have with background image, which on the other hand has or comes

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,820
with an advantage of giving us more flexibility, not the accessibility problem gives us that advantage

20
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,760
but background image in general. Still, only use it for real backgrounds,

21
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,160
that's my recommendation, 

22
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:49,560
you learned how you can control the image sizing and positioning and styling in this module too.

23
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:56,980
And finally we had a look at filters, another awesome way of adding visual effects to elements, just keep

24
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,860
the browser compatibility in mind, if you need to support Internet Explorer,

25
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:07,280
you should provide fallbacks, use a polyfill or don't use them at all.

26
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,290
And that's actually it for backgrounds and images and all that fun stuff.
