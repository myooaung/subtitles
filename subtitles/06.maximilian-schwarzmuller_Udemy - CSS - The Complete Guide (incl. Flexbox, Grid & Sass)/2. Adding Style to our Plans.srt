1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,220
So this this page as we left it and as I said, we'll work on this image a bit more in future modules,

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,570
for now I want to continue working on this page, on the content on this page to be precise,

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,170
for example our plans. This section clearly isn't finished,

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,990
we want to show a variety of plans the user may choose from here

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,340
and the styling can be improved too,

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,560
for example this could be centered but we also need more content

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,780
obviously. Then reloaded will add yet another section and then a footer but let's get there step by

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,290
step and let's start with these plans now. For that, attached with this video, you will find an HTML file

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,360
with some additional content which we add to our page.

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:50,700
We add it here in the section with the ID plans and I want to replace this paragraph here with the

11
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,670
content of the file you find attached to this video,

12
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,020
this HTML content. Here we describe the different plans

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,300
we got in our fictional store, in our fictional hosting service,

14
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,320
each plan is simply an article element here with some information like the name of the plan, the price,

15
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,980
a short subtitle if you want to call it like this and a list of the features you get with the plan.

16
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:22,260
So that is a set up, some code which you might actually see if that were a real hosting website.

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,480
If we save that and reload the page, this is what it looks like. Now actually as always, this is a working

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,680
site, well except for the buttons,

19
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,090
they don't do anything yet

20
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,000
but of course it's working,

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,400
that is not everything we want to have,

22
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,760
we want it to look good too and the look only is OK,

23
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,700
a user could probably work with that but we can certainly do way better, in the end,

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,600
what I want this section to look like is this. Now getting there is actually less difficult than it might

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,930
look like when you first see the end result,

26
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,320
so let's start working on that

27
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,060
and of course the place to start working is in our main.css file where we want to write some

28
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,310
code, some styles for this newly added content.

29
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,230
In there, if we scroll up a little bit,

30
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:20,290
so above this whole header part, we actually see that section title which we already defined and that

31
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,200
section title is the first thing we use in the plan section

32
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,940
here, we had this here before, we just added the part below it.

33
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,270
So the part below is where we will continue working

34
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:38,140
and the idea of course is to style each plan in the same way and as you saw in the preview, the middle

35
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:45,730
plan, the recommended one should be highlighted so that we kind of push the user towards picking this

36
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,750
one.

37
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:53,110
So for that, it makes sense to give each plan, so each article here the same class I guess.

38
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:59,710
The class of course can be named in whichever way you want and I will just name it plan because

39
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,640
it is a plan on my page here,

40
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,830
you could of course also name it product or anything like that.

41
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,980
So I add this plan class to all three articles and with that added, we can style it.

42
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:19,180
Now I will add these styles above my header styles but below the product overview style and there I'll

43
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,250
simply add the plan class selector

44
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,820
and with that selector, we now can get started giving this plan a nice look and I will start by

45
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:36,040
first of all giving it a background color. You can of course pick any color you want,

46
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:43,180
I'll take a light green to fit the look of the rest of our page and for that light green, I pick the

47
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,410
following hex code,

48
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,960
#d5ffdc,

49
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,830
so this is a nice green tone we can use.

50
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:59,140
I also want to align all the text inside of a plan in the center and we can do that with the text align

51
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:06,580
center property declaration where we simply define all inline elements and therefore all text that's

52
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,900
inside of the box in the center, in the middle.

53
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,580
Then we could add some padding to have some distance between the edges of our box and the content

54
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:24,160
of it and here I'll define 16 pixels as a padding but I also want to add some margin,

55
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,250
to be precise I want to add some margin to the top and bottom so that our plans have a little bit

56
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,070
more room to the section title above them and to any content that comes below them,

57
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,250
maybe 8 pixels is a good value here.

58
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,950
And finally, I want to have all my three plans sit in the same row,

59
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,800
so what we need to do is we need to set the display to inline block as you learned, this turns them into

60
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,150
inline block elements,

61
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,770
hence they now can fit into the same row

62
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,450
but for this to work, we also need to adjust their width and actually we don't need to adjust their width,

63
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,520
they would take as much width as their content requires

64
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,430
but that would probably be too much for most screens,

65
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:16,390
so I want to limit their width to 30% of the surrounding container, which in our case if we

66
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:22,020
inspect our code, simply is this div where it will also take the full available space.

67
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,390
That will mean it takes the full space given to it by this section with the ID plans, well that section

68
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,840
we never defined a style for it,

69
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,970
so it also takes the full available width as does the main section. So all the way down to our plan, a

70
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:42,020
plan by default would take the full available width, these rounding div does so,

71
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:49,300
so if we give that plan article a width of 30%, it will essentially get 30% of the page width

72
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,360
since we never restrict that on any higher level element.

73
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,650
So 30% on the plan should make sure that we fit the three plans in one row

74
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,370
and by the way for smaller screens, this will of course look very ugly,

75
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,570
it is something we'll fix in the responsive design section where we will dive deeply into how

76
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,190
you can adjust your layout for smaller screens

77
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,760
but for now, this should do the trick.

78
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,510
Now one other thing I want to do here is, I want to set the vertical align to middle to ensure that all three

79
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:29,330
plans are vertically aligned in the middle, so that the middle is the same for all of them.

80
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:37,600
Now if we save that and we go back to our page, we can reload it and this already looks quite nice,

81
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,800
we've got the three plans in one row. Now the middle one is a bit bigger because it has this extra recommended

82
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,520
badge and it should be bigger because it is the recommended plan,

83
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,350
so this actually should stand out,

84
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:55,520
we'll also change its background color and if we change the page size, then we see the plans scale with

85
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,870
it, on small devices this looks ugly and eventually we need to add a line break because the content

86
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:09,730
of the plan just is broader than the width we designed or we set up and with very big screens on the other hand,

87
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,000
our plans get stretched out.

88
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:18,290
But these are things we will work on later once we learn how to add a responsive design and

89
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,860
control the maximum widths of elements for example,

90
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,360
so that is something we will fix but for now, this is already a nice look.

91
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,290
Of course we're not done though, the plans need to be styled differently,

92
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,140
these list items need to look differently,

93
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,860
the buttons needs to look differently

94
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,380
and as I said, the middle plan, the recommended one also should look different than the other two

95
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,950
plans,

96
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,790
it should stand out.

97
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,290
Now these are all things we'll work on,

98
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,960
one other thing I also want to do is I want to center this

99
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,890
choose your plan text and if you already know how to do that, here's your chance,

100
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,200
quickly do that,

101
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,810
it's only one property you need to add.

102
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:04,100
The one property you need to it is simply the text align one, so text align will ensure that all

103
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,250
the inline content of the section title element which is a h1 element, so therefore simply the text

104
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:16,510
inside of it, that this inline content will be centered in its line and therefore will be centered

105
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,590
horizontally.

106
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,600
So if we now reload, this looks better.

107
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,510
That's a great first step,

108
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,580
now in the next lectures I want to continue working on this,

109
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,580
I want to make sure that our plans really look nice and that the middle plan really stands out from

110
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,090
the rest.
