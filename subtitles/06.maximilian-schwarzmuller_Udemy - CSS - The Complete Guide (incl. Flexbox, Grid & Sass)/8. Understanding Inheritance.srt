1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,170
So we explored specificity in the last lecture, you had that slide where I showed it to you

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,670
and with that, it's clear why the second text is actually green and why it is sans-serif.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,380
Now let's get rid of that sans-serif style here, the

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,620
h1 tag, we don't need it, I'll comment it out

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,950
and if I now reload it, we got anton back, we still have that green color because of that specificity thing.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,880
Now there is something else related to all of that and this is called inheritance.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:41,370
Now inheritance means that an element also inherits some styles of the parent element.

8
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:49,500
We don't use inheritance in our project yet, so let's add it to the project and let's add it by setting a

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,650
global default font, so that the text in our project has a global font.

10
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:03,050
I actually don't want to use anton for all the h1 tags and therefore to ensure that this and other

11
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,170
text on the page and we will add more text have a different font,

12
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,410
we should set up a global rule. Now for one,

13
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,850
we could of course add the star selector to give any element a certain look.

14
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,560
There, we could set a font family of sans-serif like this and if we save this and reload, you would

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,390
see we still have anton here because the h1 tag comes second.

16
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:35,950
So let's move the star selector after the h1 tag and save and reload and we still have anton because

17
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,160
if we inspect it, we see the star selector has the lowest priority.

18
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,550
Now this actually is something which would not be the problem here,

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,920
the problem with the star selector is that it's very inefficient the way CSS has now to parse all

20
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:58,380
our elements on the screen, so we will use it but not for a global font family. For that,

21
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,050
you instead typically use something different, you style the body.

22
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,490
Keep in mind, the body wraps all your other content,

23
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:12,920
so if you set a certain style on the body, maybe it will also change the style of your other elements.

24
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,600
So for the body, we can set a font family and actually I don't want to use sans-serif but another of

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,260
Google font

26
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,540
so let's quickly get there

27
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,990
and I want to use Monserrat.

28
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,760
Simply click on the plus again, then expand this

29
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:35,650
and here I'll quickly also go to customize and add the bold version of the font by clicking bold

30
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,300
and if I now go back to embed,

31
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,760
here is the adjusted import.

32
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:46,140
Simply grab that link, go back to your project and add it below or in front of the other font import

33
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,140
and now we can use that font family here too.

34
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,420
So let's copy that rule,

35
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,060
let's close the tab and in main.css, I'll assign this to my body.

36
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,200
Now if we save this and reload, again

37
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,390
no change,

38
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:06,710
however this is a better way of doing this because it's more efficient and theoretically, it would get

39
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:16,360
applied to that h1 style here. If you scroll down in the applied styles and you go below the browser default,

40
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:24,610
you will actually see that inherited from body section and elements inherit styles from their parents,

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,180
direct or indirect parents and not just from the body.

42
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:34,660
The body clearly is no direct parent of h1 but it is a parent in the chain of elements here and

43
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,130
therefore, some styles, not all there are exceptions but we'll dive into this later,

44
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:45,820
some styles, especially the font-related styles are passed down to child.

45
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:53,020
However inheritance has a very low specificity, inheritance always comes at the bottom even below the browser

46
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,320
defaults.

47
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:01,210
Put in other words, styles then are applied because an element is selected directly, be that through an element

48
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,780
selector,

49
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,820
a class selector, an ID selector, the universal selector, an attribute selector,

50
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,390
whenever you directly select an element, this has a higher specificity than inheritance where you don't

51
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,520
directly select an element.

52
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,850
However, if we were to add a paragraph here in the index.html file,

53
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:30,960
maybe in the second section below th h1 tag where we say make sure you get the most for your money,

54
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:41,660
if we add this and now reload the page and we inspect this paragraph, you actually see it does have that

55
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,660
style being applied, it's not strike through, it's not overwritten and therefore Monserrat is applied here

56
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,700
and you can check this by quickly ticking the style off by clicking the checkbox,

57
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,520
now that change back to times, to the browser default

58
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,290
and now it's back to Monserrat.

59
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:03,110
So inheritance is an important concept for passing styles down without explicitly selecting an element

60
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,920
and especially for things like font sizes, font families,

61
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,470
this is extremely useful because you typically want to have one and the same style for the majority of

62
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,380
your text on your screen and therefore, setting this up in the body section is a great way as it will

63
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,790
then make sure you can use inheritance.

64
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,220
Again, that's not limited to the body section, it works with any parent

65
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,100
but if you want to have it for the entire page, the body section obviously is a great place.

66
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,130
Important though,

67
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:39,270
inheritance works but any direct selector has a higher specificity and therefore will overwrite your inheritance

68
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:45,210
if it defines the same property as we do here with the font family anton on the h1 tag.
