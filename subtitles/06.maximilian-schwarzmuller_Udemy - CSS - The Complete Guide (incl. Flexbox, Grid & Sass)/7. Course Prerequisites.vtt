What are the course prerequisites? What does it take you to succeed in this course?

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.290
We talked about this already at the beginning of this module,

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:17.230
you need to have at least some basic HTML knowledge. That's really important because CSS builds up

4
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.990
on HTML

5
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.670
and therefore, knowing at least the basics is a must.

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.630
But the good news is that beside this basic HTML knowledge, no advanced web-dev knowledge is required.

7
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.180
You don't need to know JavaScript or any frameworks or even CSS because we will learn CSS

8
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.930
in this course.

9
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.070
So therefore, having the basic HTML knowledge is everything you need to get started with CSS.
