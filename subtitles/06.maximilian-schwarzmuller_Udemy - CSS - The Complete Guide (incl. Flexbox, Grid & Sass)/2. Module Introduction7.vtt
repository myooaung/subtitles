Welcome to this module on backgrounds and images. Now that Manuel walked us through the position property

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.500
and how we can use it to position elements on our page,

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.000
I want to dive back into some important visuals of our page, images and backgrounds. Pretty much any website

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.600
has images and backgrounds and it's important that you know how you can style these things,

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.990
specifically what we'll have a look at this module is how we can actually use that background property

6
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.500
because there's more than just a color or an image we can set on it. We'll then dive in detail into how

7
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.640
you can style images and background images and we'll also have a look at gradients, what they are and

8
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.110
how you can create both linear and radial gradients and use them on your page

9
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.810
and finally towards the end, I'll also dive into filters,

10
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.280
explain what they are and how you may use them.

11
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.280
So a lot of ground to cover,

12
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.720
let's dive right into it and let's start with that background image we had in our website.
