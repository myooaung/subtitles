00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.270
So welcome to the start of this advanced track. You'll remember from the course outline, we get three

2
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.370
tracks in this course and this is the first module which belongs to the so-called advanced track, which

3
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.360
really just means it's an entry point

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.640
in case you skipped the last module or modules and that's also important,

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.480
if you didn't skip these modules, you can skip this video,

6
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.980
you can stop here and continue with the rest of the module of course.

7
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.970
So what is our current state,

8
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.450
what did we do so far? Attached to this video, you find the project, the course project in its latest version,

9
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.990
so how we built it, what we added up to this point. We're building this example fictional web hosting

10
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.480
company's page from a design or from a CSS styling perspective only

11
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.470
and this is what we got.

12
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.980
We got our starting page, the packages page is working, customers and start hosting is not working yet, 

13
00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.910
we'll add this throughout the course later and in later modules and in this module, we'll work on this background image,

14
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.880
on images in general to be precise.

15
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.370
Now here's the code for that,

16
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.570
this is what you find attached. As you can see, we got this 

17
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.530
index.html file which holds the HTML code of our starting page, we use a bunch of classes and

18
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.760
ID selectors in there,

19
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.930
we use the selectors to be precise in the main.css and shared.css files, shared.css contains the

20
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.510
code for our header for example and for our footer,

21
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.740
so for things we share amongst our different pages, the packages page is the only other page we've got thus

22
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.270
far

23
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.110
but here we also import the shared file as you can see.

24
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.090
And then we get the page specific CSS files, 

25
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.490
packages.css for the packages page, main.css for our main home page here and

26
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.060
there, we have a bunch of CSS declarations and rules which turn our HTML code into

27
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.360
this page here and definitely feel free to go through all that code to totally understand what's going

28
00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.950
on.

29
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.410
We also got that image which we're using and that images folder which holds the general background of

30
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.130
our plans

31
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.020
we got on that second page here.

32
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.380
So this is everything we get up to this point,

33
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.400
again dive into the code, explore it so that we're all on the same page

34
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.670
and with that, let's dive into this module on backgrounds and images.
