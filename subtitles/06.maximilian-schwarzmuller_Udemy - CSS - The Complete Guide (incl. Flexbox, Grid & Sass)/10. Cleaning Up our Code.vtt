00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.580
And let's wrap this module up

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:13.230
by first of all making sure that we have this new toggle button, as well as our mobile navigation available

3
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.720
in all our files.

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.640
We added the CSS code in the shared folder, in the shared.css file

5
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:27.760
so this will be available but now we also need to add our HTML code to the other files. For that, let's

6
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.490
start with the nav, the mobile nav,

7
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.680
let's copy it and add it to the index.html

8
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.130
file in the packages folder after header in front of main,

9
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.380
so there.

10
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.320
Now let's adjust the links, for packages, it's just the index.html file in that folder,

11
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.600
for customers we have to go up one level and then to customers and for start hosting,

12
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.640
eventually this will also be the case.

13
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.080
Now let's copy it again

14
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.570
and let's go to customers and there, let's also add it after header, in front of main and let's adjust

15
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.720
the links here too.

16
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.240
For packages we have to go up one level and then down to packages. For customers,

17
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.000
we're already in the right folder,

18
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.120
so let's remove that folder navigation and for start hosting, it stays as it is. Now

19
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.850
again we also need to add that hamberger button, so the button we added in front of our brand.

20
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.650
Let's go to our brand link here or to this button in front of it to be precise,

21
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.830
let's copy it and let's add it to or in front of our brand in the other pages too.

22
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.270
So here in the index.html file in the packages folder, there in that div right in front of that

23
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.150
anchor tag,

24
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.010
I'll add my button style, button code

25
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.970
I should say and in customers, I'll do the same, right in front of the anchor tag, like this.

26
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.890
If we now save that and reload,

27
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.370
we can go to packages and I actually get a favicon error here which we can ignore for now,

28
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.690
the rest does look good here though so this all works.

29
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.870
Clicking on the button here however doesn't work,

30
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.050
now what's missing?

31
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.760
The thing that's missing is simply the shared.js file,

32
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.730
we need to import that too.

33
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.310
So from our root index.html file, at the bottom,

34
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.920
let's copy that script import and let's add it to the other files too, right in front of the closing body tag.

35
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.580
Now here we need to adjust the import path and go up one level and the same for the customers page

36
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.510
and now since we get an error regarding that favicon on packages, let's also fix it there,

37
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.410
we simply need to go up one level here to get the right favicon.

38
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.720
So now with that, we can reload and

39
00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.250
now we're importing the Javascript code but now we get a new error, can't read property add event listener 

40
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.080
of null.

41
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.160
Now what's the problem here?

42
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.920
The problem here is that in our Javascript code, we're adding event listeners to our select plan buttons

43
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:21.620
and these buttons simply don't exist on the packages page or on our customers page and therefore, this code

44
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.660
just fails.

45
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.910
We don't have these buttons there, so it can't succeed.

46
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.450
This however is not really the problem because this code will only run for every element we got on our button

47
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.580
list and if we get no buttons, the list will be empty and this code will never execute.

48
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.400
We got one other piece of code that is related to the modal though and that's the modal no button here, this

49
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.960
also always executes and that is our issue.

50
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:56.620
Now here, we simply have to wrap it in an if block where we check if modal no button, just like that,

51
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.990
this will only return true if it finds a valid reference to the button.

52
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.770
So if we wrap the code inside of that if statement, it will not run

53
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.610
if we get no such reference.

54
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:14.130
So now if we reload on the packages page, it will work and we can open and close the side menu, well closing

55
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.390
doesn't work though,

56
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.200
class list can't be accessed for our backdrop.

57
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.210
Let's quickly go into the HTML file,

58
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.060
we got our backdrop here but

59
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.140
of course the problem we have eventually is not that we can't access the backdrop but in close modal

60
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.650
which we always execute,

61
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.610
we try to remove the open class from the modal and we also don't have a modal on other pages. So we can

62
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.470
simply wrap that again

63
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:48.070
and of course you could also find a different solution where you separate your to be executed methods

64
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.350
clear, here however this is fine since we don't have that many other cases.

65
00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:00.290
So I will just wrap modal with the same code as I did with the modal no button, like this

66
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.410
and now this code will also only run if we got a modal.

67
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:12.950
So if we reload again, now opening and closing does work and the same on our customers page.

68
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:20.690
So with that, we got our project in a state where we have Javascript added to it to dynamically change

69
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:28.010
the content during runtime and take advantage of this to manipulate what the user sees after the page

70
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.940
has been loaded.
