00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.090
Our page is taking shape,

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.950
let's now add a footer.

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.840
We got a header in the navigation bar,

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.480
we also want a footer. For that,

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.300
you will again find an HTML file attached to this video which contains the code we have to add. We

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.330
add it below the main section

7
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.520
but before we close the body and this simply adds the footer element with navigation inside of it

8
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.040
that holds on an unordered list of the links.

9
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.430
The links lead nowhere

10
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.810
but hey, it's only there to build a nice UI.

11
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.020
So we got our footer,

12
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.720
now the goal is to style it and if we have a look at our header, we assigned main header as a class.

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.450
Therefore to this footer, I will assign main footer because for the same reason as with the header, we

14
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:56.110
could use a footer in other places of our app too, so directly targeting the footer is something that would

15
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.410
work in this app but might not work in other apps and we're always safe if we add such a class because

16
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:09.280
if we ever add another footer element anywhere on our page, we will not use any code we wrote previously

17
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.900
which we then have to refactor,

18
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.750
we simply write code that will not break the future right from the start.

19
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.360
So I added that main footer class and with that in the main.css file,

20
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.790
we can start styling.

21
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.550
I'll now add this below the main header because it's like a general style which we will share across

22
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.880
pages eventually and below the header because it's at the bottom of the page and I will target that

23
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.580
main footer class with that class selector.

24
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.540
Now let's first of all save both files and reload, this is what the footer looks like right now,

25
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.590
we can work on that. And to work on that,

26
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.520
I'll start by adding a background color,

27
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.490
I'll set it to black and a text color of white.

28
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.680
If we do that and reload,

29
00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.980
we get the black background,

30
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:07.990
we get some space around it, so some margin by a child element probably, we can confirm this by inspecting

31
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.470
that and we see the unordered list has a top and bottom margin which due to margin collapsing is merged

32
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.950
with the parent element margin because it's the first and last or the only child in this case

33
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.560
and therefore, we need to work on that margin,

34
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.760
we need to work on that list in general and the white color isn't applied because keep in mind,

35
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.680
the white color is set on that footer here,

36
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.630
the text lives in our anchor tags though.

37
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.970
If we inspect these, they inherit this set up of course

38
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.240
but as you learned many times before, inheritance is overwritten by directly assigned styles and there

39
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:57.990
is a directly assigned style, this color, the browser default which is in turn then the blue color.

40
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.350
So this is something we have to overwrite explicitly, so setting it here on the main footer element actually

41
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.990
doesn't do anything.

42
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.450
Well, what we can do here though is we can add some padding, maybe 32 pixels and some space to the top,

43
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.390
maybe margin top of let's say 48 pixels

44
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.720
and if you're wondering how I come up with these values, I basically always or often take multiples of

45
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.540
the default font size of the browser which is 16 pixels

46
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.890
but again you will learn more about that in the dimensions and units module of this course where we will

47
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.360
dive deeper into the different values

48
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.440
you can assign,

49
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.530
that's just a side note here.

50
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.970
So margin top, 48 pixels on the main footer,

51
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.780
now I want to select the unordered list in the main footer and for that, we of course can assign classes

52
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.580
there.

53
00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.700
We could also use combinators of course and for a practice, that might be worth doing it,

54
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.600
I'll add some classes here though, I'll name this one

55
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.180
here main footer links and then my list item here gets class,

56
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.310
main footer link,

57
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.050
the actual link is the anchor tag but the list item holds that,

58
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.250
so basically it constructs the link

59
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.050
you could say.

60
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.560
And now back to 

61
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.660
main.css,

62
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:35.710
I'll add main footer links which targets the unordered list to set the list style to none and the margin to

63
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.210
zero,

64
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.350
the padding to zero,

65
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:45.850
we did that multiple times before and also set text align to center because if we save that now and

66
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.270
we reload, we see now the text is still blue but centered in the middle already.

67
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.530
Now let's work on that text color then and on the general look and behavior of these links

68
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.190
and for that I'll target main footer link,

69
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.050
so that's the other class we assigned

70
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.840
and here I'll set it to display

71
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.600
inline block to make sure that the list items on which this class is added are sitting in the same line

72
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.610
and I'll add a margin of zero to top and bottom but I want have some distance between the list items

73
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.160
which are in the same line due to inline block,

74
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.040
so margin left and right could be 16 pixels.

75
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.880
If we save that and reload, then we see they're now in the same line with some space in between.

76
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.150
Last thing is I want to change the look of the text and that's the anchor tag as you learned, so

77
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:46.120
now let's use main footer link and then the descendant or direct child combinator to select the anchor

78
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.470
tag itself

79
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.720
and there I can set the color to white and the text decoration to none to remove the link

80
00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:05.010
and here's main footer anchor tag hover and main footer anchor tag active and of course I meant main

81
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.440
footer link, though main footer with the descendant operator would have worked too because there only

82
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.370
is one link in the entire footer,

83
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.740
so one set of links I should say and they should get the style

84
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.450
but this is the more precise and performant way of selecting these

85
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.440
and now we can set some styles for when we hover over these links, maybe a light grey,

86
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.780
#ccc gives us such a light grey look.

87
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.340
Let's try it out, let's reload, yes there's a slight change if we hover over them and that's a nice looking

88
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.250
footer in my opinion

89
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.510
and with that, the first version of our starting page is done.

90
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.130
Now let's analyze what we did and what we can do as a next step thereafter.
