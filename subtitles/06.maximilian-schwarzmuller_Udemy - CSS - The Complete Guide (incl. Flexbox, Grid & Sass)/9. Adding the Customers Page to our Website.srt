1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,830
Let's add a customers page and for that, let's first of all create a new folder in our project, I'll name

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:15,080
it customers and in there, I'll create an index.html file and a customers.css

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,200
file. Now into the index.html file, copy the code of the file, the HTML file you'll find attached

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,520
to this lecture,

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,020
this content here.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,420
Now there, we already also have the import to

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,450
customers.css,

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,160
so that is added right out of the box.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,970
Now we also need to add our header here though,

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:43,500
so let's go to index.html and grab our entire header code from there and go to the customers

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,510
page and add it here,

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,780
by the way let's also add the updated header with our image to our packages file.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,940
However for that, let's first of all fix the images path

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,390
here in the customers header,

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,300
we need to go up one level to reach the images folder

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,720
and again let's do the same for our other header.

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,380
Actually, we just need to copy the image here, the header image, 

18
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:13,080
so let's go to the packages folder and replace the uHost text with the image there too, make sure that

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,020
the path is correct here too.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,880
So back into the customers file, we got the header,

21
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,940
we get that main content I shared with that attached file,

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:28,590
you see some text and you also see some image imports there and we get the footer.

23
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,480
Now regarding the image imports, you'll find two images attached to this video too,

24
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,120
customer 1 and 2,

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,390
let's insert these into our images folder

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,520
and with that, the last thing I have to do is check if our links are correct.

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,030
So on the main page, here index.html, in the navigation, we should navigate for customers to the

28
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,110
customers folder and the index.html file

29
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:02,190
and for packages if we go there, we should go to one level up and then into the customers folder and from

30
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,140
inside the customers page, in our header,

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,200
we also need to adjust the links because we copied that in from our main page. For packages,

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,270
we should go up one level and then go into the packages folder. For the brand,

33
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,030
we should also go up one level and then navigate to index.html,

34
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,680
so to our main.html file. For customers

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,980
however, we can just target index.html because that's exactly the page we are on and start hosting,

36
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,230
well we don't have that yet,

37
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,130
we'll add it later.

38
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,690
Just a quick check in 

39
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,280
packages,

40
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,640
ok

41
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,550
the brand link is OK.

42
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:43,350
So with that if we save all files and we reload the page, we should be able to go to customers now and

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,930
here we get our two customer testimonials.

44
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,750
Awesome guys,

45
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,280
they really like our service and I like that

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,150
we position them in a very prominent way but maybe a little bit too prominent, maybe we can do more with

47
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,070
their images,

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,610
especially if we consider that I wasn't even zoomed in. So if I do zoom in as I am on the rest of the pages

49
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,920
to make this more readable,

50
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,460
yes

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,470
then we really got some styling issues here, we don't even see our customers that well.

52
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,870
Now over the next lectures, we'll work on this page, mostly on the images of course.
