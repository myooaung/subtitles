00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:08.600
Welcome to another module. Let's dive deeper into CSS and if we were to give this module a lot different

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.270
title, it would probably be working with boxes

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.410
and after this module, you'll also know why. Specifically we'll dive into the box model,

4
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.610
a core part of CSS, really easy to understand thankfully but really important to know too, so that

5
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.890
is what we'll start with.

6
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.060
We'll then have a look at how we can actually change the height and width of elements,

7
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.300
we'll have a look at the display property which helps us with layouting our page and positioning elements

8
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.650
next to each other for example and we'll also dive into properties worth to remember. I mentioned that

9
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.170
there is this complete reference of properties and CSS features which you can always consult if

10
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.770
you want to dive deeper but there is a common set of properties you work with a lot,

11
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.660
so I want to share some of the properties I personally find to be the most important ones.

12
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.420
And finally, we'll have a look at these pseudo classes and elements I already mentioned in the last

13
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.440
core section,

14
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.490
now we'll learn what they are and what you can do with them.

15
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.630
So with that, let's just get started and let's continue working on our webpage.
