00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.940
Now that we learned about the different types of selectors, attribute selectors we can use, how can we select

2
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.740
this input of type checkbox?

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.030
Well, there is one obvious way of doing that I'd say but there also are other ways,

4
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.350
so let's try different ways. In the start-hosting.css file,

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.320
I'll add my signup-form selector because again I'll use the descendant combinator

6
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.130
and then I want to target all inputs which have a certain attribute and the easiest way of targeting

7
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.610
the checkbox would be to select inputs which have the type attribute, where the type attribute value

8
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.910
equals checkbox and that would only be correct for our checkbox element here.

9
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.500
Now there is absolutely nothing wrong with that approach and it would be the approach you use

10
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.270
in reality probably.

11
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.610
However let's copy that and comment out the first approach,

12
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.530
we could also say we want to target all elements where the ID attribute contains the term 'terms', so the

13
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.600
word 'terms' because if we go back, we see that our checkbox has an ID attribute which contains terms,

14
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.210
we could have also looked for agree terms or just agree.

15
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.780
This also is only true for this input,

16
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.010
so this is also a perfectly fine selector here.

17
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.340
Now there are of course other ways of doing that too,

18
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.810
you could search for the suffix terms or the prefix agree or with the pipe symbol,

19
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.380
agree

20
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.650
which would also include agree-terms.

21
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.740
There are other ways,

22
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.160
definitely feel free to play around with that,

23
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.590
now I will go with this ID selector here.

24
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.450
The question is, how do we want to style this?

25
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.710
Now I want to set the display here to inline block.

26
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.120
I still want to have the block level features, for example the margin to the top but I also want to

27
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.100
position this in line with my label which is next to it,

28
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.220
therefore this is something I definitely need.

29
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.100
Speaking of that, we should also just select that label and if we have a look at our HTML code, we see

30
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.770
that the label is coming after this input.

31
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.210
Now again, we get couple of ways for selecting the label:

32
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.110
we could select it by attribute selector,

33
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.520
we could use that for attribute and again use terms or something like that.

34
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.820
We can also use a combinator though, we can copy that input

35
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.120
ID term selector and add a comma after it,

36
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:46.800
then add it again and now use the plus combinator and label. This will target all labels that directly follow

37
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.340
this element, which is only the case for this label here.

38
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.960
So now with that, we're setting this to inline block too and I'll set the width back to auto for now.

39
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.370
With that, if we save all of that and we go back to our project and reload, we actually see that the label

40
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:14.010
and our checkbox are back in one line and we also see that the button is in the same line, we'll take care

41
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.060
about this later,

42
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.850
for now this is a great first step, bringing us closer to our desired outcome.

43
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.220
Now let's also take care about the button immediately and I'll do that by using another selector,

44
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.330
I'll use my signup-form and select the button which has the type submit.

45
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.410
Technically, we would not need this because it's the only button but again, to practice all these attributes

46
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.420
selectors and for that button, I'll then simply set the display to block like this,

47
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.880
if we reload now, button is in a new line,

48
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.150
let's maybe also add a little bit of margin to the top of 1rem to have some distance in there

49
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.860
and now this is looking better in my opinion.

50
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.540
Now we get this nice structure here, ensuring that our code looks good or our form looks good I should

51
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.370
say.

52
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.620
Why is the button now not spanning over the full width

53
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.220
you might wonder? Well it is a block level element but just like inputs, it by default doesn't take all

54
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.560
the width for its content,

55
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.540
we would have to manually set width 100% and I'm not interested in doing this here.

56
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:29.350
Now with these first steps taken, before we dive into the actual styling of the single elements, let's

57
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.720
switch into mobile mode because Manuel explained that we would develop everything mobile first

58
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.790
from now on and we will.

59
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.810
Now, this doesn't look too bad on mobile right now,

60
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.950
it also doesn't look great.

61
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.190
Now the general structure of having all these elements beneath each other will be the same

62
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.370
but now we should work on centering that correctly,

63
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.210
maybe adding some padding, stuff like that.

64
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.740
So let's do that.

65
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.790
For that, I'll go up in my CSS file

66
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.360
and below the sign-up title, I'll add a style for the signup-form

67
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.170
and there we could just add a padding of 1rem to all directions, so that if we reload the page, our content

68
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.930
isn't sitting directly on the edges, so this certainly looks better in my opinion.

69
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:26.540
We also can target our signup-form label in general here and give it a font weight of bold,

70
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.830
this will just ensure that the labels are a bit easier to see.

71
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:36.250
I'd say, so this also, is in my opinion, quite a nice style. Now for bigger screens,

72
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:43.750
if we're not in the mobile mode, this is way too big though. So we should add a media query at the bottom maybe

73
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.620
and give it a min 

74
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.660
width of 40rem which is the breakpoint we used on the other pages too,

75
00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:01.240
there we also used 40rem quite a bit and in there, I now also want to target my signup-form and give it

76
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:09.090
a margin of auto and maybe a width of 30rem.

77
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.960
If we save that and reload, now our form is narrower,

78
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.910
it's centered in the middle too

79
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:23.260
and only if we shrink the size to smaller devices, it also snaps to the edges and takes the full

80
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.860
available width and it doesn't grow on bigger screens because it shouldn't.

81
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.490
So this is now certainly looking better, now

82
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:38.010
maybe it's still a bit too wide, a bit too much space, so we could decrease that.

83
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:47.030
We could set it to let's say 25rem, like this and now I think this is looking good.

84
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:54.090
Now obviously, we have this edge case here where we're on a smaller device and it's quite big

85
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.930
but actually keep in mind, I'm zoomed in here, this actually looks good on the smaller devices

86
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.730
we do use in reality.

87
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:07.740
So I'm liking that look. With that out of the way, with the general layout set,

88
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.580
it's now time to continue

89
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.400
and now I want to focus on styling the individual form elements.
