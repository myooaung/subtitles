1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,760
So what about these font formats right here,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,180
this ttf that we use so far? By the way,

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,440
we can also add the format after that, like this, with the quotation marks

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,120
and this would be the so-called true type format, like that.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,020
This is an optional information we can add,

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:30,560
this simply gives the browser additional information regarding our font format right here.

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,230
So as I said, not required but to make sure our code is as complete as possible,

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,150
we can actually add this right here and right there also,

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,640
so for both of our imports right here for the font face. However, we only use this true type format so far

10
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,350
and the thing is that we have other file types available for our font formats

11
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,770
and now I could dive into all these formats step-by-step and talk about this but I think the better approach

12
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:09,090
is really if we just go back to caniuse.com and I show you some of the formats and especially

13
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,720
the browser compatibility

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,220
because as we know so far, we're going to make sure that as many visitors as possible can access the

15
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,390
fonts on our website, so the browser compatibility is definitely an important factor.

16
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,510
Now let's start with our ttf,

17
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,140
this is the true type font or the open type font also available right here, As we can see right here,

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,610
the general support in the browsers is quite good,

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,920
the only browser that's really not supporting it perfectly is Opera Mini,

20
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:48,000
yes but also the IE which only has a partial support but generally, the font format we use seems

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,240
to be not the worst one.

22
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,690
Another one we could use is woff, this one. As you can see, the web open font format right here

23
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,270
and if you read the description right there, this is a compressed true type or open type font

24
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,920
and the first thing that's really good about that is, well if it's a compressed format, it's smaller and

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,250
therefore it makes our website faster because we will later see when we talk about the font display

26
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,960
property that fonts can become quite big, so the file size of font families can become quite big.

27
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,000
This is maybe unexpected and therefore, the compression and loading times and maybe impacting these loading

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,460
times is important when using our font faces right here, our customized font faces.

29
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,550
As I said, more about that later

30
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,370
at the end of this module. However we can see that the woff format is compressed, which is great and that the

31
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,790
browser support is also quite awesome.

32
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:52,110
So if we compare it with our first format, the ttf format, then we can say that ttf is really good because

33
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:59,250
it's really well-known and well used format by font builders actually, by font face builders but the browser

34
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,570
support is not perfect as we saw with the IE. For the woff format,

35
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:09,240
we have a better compression and a better browser support. In addition to the woff format,

36
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,420
we also have woff two right here. As you can see, this provides an even better compression but we can see

37
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,840
that browsers support for the IE is not there at all

38
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,880
and also Safari support is limited.

39
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,140
So to summarize what we saw, we have the ttf format as a basic, which is widespread and well-known but you

40
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,480
have the problem with the IE. We then have woff which has a better compression and is faster and has

41
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,730
a better browser support in general

42
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,800
and then we have woff two which is the fastest one with the best compression but with some limitations

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,740
regarding browser compatibility.

44
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:50,220
Therefore, what we could do now is we could simply add all three formats to our source for the font family.

45
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:57,220
The problem is of course that we only have our custom font in this ttf format and in this course, we also want

46
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,480
to create the other files

47
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,350
now. But in theory, if you have these files, what you could simply do is you could simply copy the URL

48
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,560
right here, like that,

49
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,090
maybe like this. Important, get rid of the semi-colon right here and change it to a comma,

50
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,500
also right here and then add it a third time,

51
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:23,580
now with the semi-colon again and then you could start with woff two right here, the format for woff

52
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,580
two is also woff two.

53
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,830
Then we have woff as a second choice,

54
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,110
this one and that one, not woff two, woff only

55
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:40,370
and then the ttf, our true type as the third format that we have. As I said, in our case, we don't have all

56
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,610
these formats, so we only need ttf so we can delete these

57
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,830
but I just wanted to show you how this would work in general

58
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,660
and with these formats, you're actually quite safe when it comes to your custom fonts.

59
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,160
There are also other formats to be honest

60
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:04,940
but the reason I'm not diving deeper into these is if I go back to caniuse.com and for example

61
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,080
enter eot, like that, the embedded open type font,

62
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,930
well you can see what I mean.

63
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,850
We don't have any browser support at all,

64
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,900
the only browser that supports it is the IE

65
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,450
and we saw that woff is also perfectly supporting the IE,

66
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:29,460
so I don't think it is required to dive deeper into the other formats that we have right here for our fonts.

67
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,120
So with that, we understood these different fonts formats and we can now dive deeper into different

68
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,250
font properties that we can use for our fonts in the next lecture.
