00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.580
So our page is clearly taking shape,

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.660
I like the look of it already.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.880
Now I want to add a new section to it,

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.160
I want to add another section on this product landing page which we're essentially creating here, where

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.330
we present the core features of our hosting service to the user.

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.170
For this, I want to have a clear and strong background color and I want to have some key figures which

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.890
we present to the customer. For that, attached to this video,

8
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.470
you'll find another HTML file which holds the code for the next section we add below the other

9
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.690
section, so below the plan section

10
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:50.400
but before we close the main part and this section here has another section title and then it has an

11
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.880
unordered list of a couple of list items where each has an empty div, so we can add something there

12
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.060
and where each has some advertising text, some key figure, whatever.

13
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:11.900
Now this is the next section we'll work on, if we save that with that code added and we reload the page,

14
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.580
we'd of course only see the unstyled version of it.

15
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.720
Now the idea is to turn it into this,

16
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.230
so let's work on this together.
