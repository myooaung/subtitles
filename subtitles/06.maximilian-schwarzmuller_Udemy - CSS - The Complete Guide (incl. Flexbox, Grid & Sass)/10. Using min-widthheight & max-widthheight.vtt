00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.920
Before we dive into other units we didn't use so far,

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:14.270
let me show you an interesting combination of pixels and percentages because although we will talk about

3
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:22.040
responsive design in a separate module, the current behavior we can see right here, that the image gets

4
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.930
smaller and smaller,

5
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.730
this is nice,

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.790
as you can see the formatting is not perfect,

7
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.120
as I said we'll fix that in the corresponding module

8
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.540
but if we increase the size, we can see that our image gets bigger and bigger

9
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.930
and although we love our customers, I think that's a bit too big.

10
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.970
Therefore let's do our first steps towards a responsive design right now.

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.080
For that, let's quickly recap how this image or the size of this image is defined because the image is

12
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.870
inside this image container,

13
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.240
here we have the image, the image has a width of 100%.

14
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.950
It's 100% of its containing block which is this testimonial image container class right here

15
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.240
and this has a width of 65% of its containing block which is the testimonial class,

16
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:17.890
so the entire page width right here as we can see it. Now wouldn't it be great if we could limit the size of

17
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.680
the container because if the image has a width of 100% of our container,

18
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.660
well if the container wouldn't get bigger and bigger and bigger, then the image will also stay smaller.

19
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.410
We can do this as I said with the combination of pixels and percentages.

20
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.610
So let's go back to our code, specifically to the customer.css file, this one right here

21
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.690
and here we can see our image,

22
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.070
we just had a look at that and our image container

23
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.350
and this 65%, this width we applied, is fine,

24
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.260
I think it doesn't look bad, it fits the structure of the page but now let us add a second property,

25
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.650
the so-called max width property,

26
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.630
this one right here.

27
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.410
Now what's the idea behind that?

28
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.830
With the width right here, we have this percentage value,

29
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.650
this means the image increases and increases depending on the width of our device.

30
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.840
But if we now add a fixed value as a maximum width, we could restrict that width to this maximum we defined

31
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.550
and with that, our image wouldn't get bigger than we want it to be.

32
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:33.230
For example, if we inspect our image, we can see it has like 573 pixels now which is already quite big

33
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.250
but let's say we fix it to 580 pixels.

34
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.170
So if we do that right here and reload the page, you can see that nothing's changed

35
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.850
and if I decrease the size, it still gets smaller and smaller

36
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.500
but if I increase the size now, can you see it? Right here

37
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:59.230
as soon as we reach our limit that we defined, this 580 pixels, our image cannot get

38
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.110
any bigger

39
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.950
and that's of course a big improvement because imagine visiting our site on a really big device, a TV

40
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.140
screen for example.

41
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.340
I think it wouldn't be a good look if you would just see the entire screen filled with these two images,

42
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.530
therefore this max width property is a really easy way to make sure that you restrict the maximum size

43
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.900
of your images.

44
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.180
What you could also do is, you could for example change the max width to a let's say min width right here

45
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.730
and say that min width shouldn't be smaller than for example let's see, well let's say this size right

46
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.180
here,

47
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.510
so this is 

48
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.510
350 pixels let's say,

49
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:50.460
so this is also possible of course. We can specify a min width also, like that, 250, 350 pixels like that.

50
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.750
So with that, we can see that our image doesn't get smaller than right here, what we intended,

51
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.820
as you can see it will stay the way it is, although that's not the perfect behavior yet

52
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.220
as you can see it but if we increase the size, it will increase and increase.

53
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.590
Therefore, we will stick to our max width for the moment because this worked better as I would say

54
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.880
and we'll come back to the mobile design, so we will ensure that the behavior we have for the smaller

55
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.100
screen also works perfectly in the responsive design module.

56
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.030
The important thing to keep in mind for you is that with the combination of a width property with a percentage

57
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:37.500
value and a max width defined with a fixed value, pixels in our case, you can make sure that your website

58
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:45.750
also is displayed in a nice way, on really big screens or with the min width value, you you can make sure that

59
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.120
certain elements are not displayed smaller than intended by you. We will dive deeper into these two properties

60
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.950
when we work with the responsive design. I just wanted to make sure that you have these concepts in mind

61
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.590
as we talk about units

62
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:07.680
but with that, we can now continue and finally leave the world of percentages and pixels and have a closer

63
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.070
look at fonts because our font size is not perfect yet

64
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.490
and if I look at our customers page for example, I can see a lot of pixels, right here for example.

65
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:25.380
Now for the fonts, we have better options than pixels, so let's have a look at rem and em in the next lecture.
