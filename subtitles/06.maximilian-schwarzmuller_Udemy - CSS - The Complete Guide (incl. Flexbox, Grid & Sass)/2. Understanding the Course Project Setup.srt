00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,740
So to get started, attached to this video, you'll find the following files,

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,610
the index.html file and the favicon.png file.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,640
Now the favicon is only there so that we have it,

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,120
it's not related to CSS, the index.html file is the important one,

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,490
it's the first piece of the course project we're going to build.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,280
If you open it with your favorite editor or IDE, I am using Visual Studio Code here,

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,980
then you can see that we get a normal HTML5 skeleton inside of that file.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,180
We've got a doctype, we've got the HTML opening and closing tag,

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,310
then we get a head section where we set some meta tags as well as a title

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:46,760
and since we're building a fictional web hosting company or the website of this company, we named it

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,250
uHost and you have the body tag.

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,660
Now the body tag of course holds the content of our web page

13
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,220
and right now this really is just a main tag,

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,920
a section tag and in there, this hi tag. So not too exciting but we'll add more and more throughout

15
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,410
this course

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,960
of course. This is already some great code with which we can get started though, which is the reason why

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,380
it's there. Now

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,680
all these things here are different HTML selectors

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,400
and now if we open that web page, if we double-click on that index.html file and we open in the browser

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,050
therefore, we should see something like this.

21
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,730
The exact thing you see here might differ depending on which browser you use,

22
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,040
I'm using Chrome,

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,830
I strongly recommend using Chrome because of its developer tools which we'll also use later but this

24
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:39,140
is what you should roughly see, just some text which has actually some styling,

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,700
it's a bit bigger than the default text would be,

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,740
it is fat but it doesn't look super great and there certainly is more we can do with it.

27
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:54,040
So this is our starting set up and our goal is to turn this into this.

28
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:00,320
So as you can see, what we have here is some background color of the surrounding element as it looks

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,280
like and the text is then inside of that background and looks a bit differently.

30
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:13,600
This is achieved via CSS, not via HTML because HTML leads to what we see here,

31
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,880
it's about the content and the structure of our page in the end and we get all of that.

32
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,960
We got the content there, we can read it, this page although it doesn't have that many features right

33
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,100
now, is fully usable,

34
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,560
this is super important to understand, it's fully usable.

35
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,540
So what we can now do is we can make it more beautiful

36
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:39,200
and for that we can use CSS. Now in the next video, we'll dive into using CSS and I will show you three

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,680
different ways of adding CSS code to this page.
