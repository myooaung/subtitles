00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:09.170
So attached to this video, you again find an HTML file with some content which you should add

2
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.040
to your index.html

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.400
file in the packages folder. There in that main area which currently is empty,

4
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.560
just paste the styles in and what you will see is that we've got three sections here.

5
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.910
These are again our three plans because we're now on the detail page where we can read more about them,

6
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.190
though technically here is less information I guess but we're at least providing a more detailed description

7
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.040
here.

8
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.630
So if we now reload that packages page, this is what it looks like and I don't know about you but

9
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.610
beautiful is different, I guess.

10
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.800
So the reason why it looks like this is we enclose all the content in the link because the entire plan

11
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.670
should be clickable in the end and we will connect this to our to be created

12
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.120
start hosting folder in the future.

13
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.790
Now your goal is to style this page to look like this,

14
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.030
this will still not be the final state,

15
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.570
we'll then add something together to make sure that the middle plan actually is pushed to the right.

16
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.870
Definitely try this on your own,

17
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.380
these are all things we learned before

18
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.970
and of course over the next lectures, we'll solve this together.

19
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.070
So good luck with that,

20
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.470
try to add as many of the styles you can see on the preview as possible.
