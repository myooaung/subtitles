00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:09,260
So back on our more beautiful website and let's now make sure that our navigation up here also becomes

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,890
a fixed navigation bar which is always visible.

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:20,810
Therefore, we have to go back to the code and we only need the main index.html file and the shared.css

4
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:27,230
file. We need the index.html file because I want to show you that we have to work on the header

5
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:34,550
right here because in this header we have our navigation and specifically, we have to work on the class

6
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:41,780
main header because this class includes our brand name, uHost and of course also the classes with

7
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,100
the packages, the customers and the start hosting button.

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,980
Now as I said we need to go to the shared.css file because the navigation bar will be displayed on

9
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,340
all pages on our website and in the shared.css file,

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,680
we now have to go to the main header class.

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,460
Well, we have a width of 100% applied already which is totally fine,

12
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,520
we saw that in the theoretical example,

13
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,250
we will need that,

14
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,280
so let's keep it

15
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,640
but now we have to add the position property with the value of fixed.

16
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,460
And before we change anything else, let's see what it looks like

17
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,520
by just adding this declaration and that's really interesting, right?

18
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,680
It actually looks quite fine

19
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:30,170
immediately, we have the problem that the image and the slogan are partially hidden below this navigation

20
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:30,740
bar,

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,990
we'll fix that in one of the next videos

22
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,630
but generally, the navigation bar is fixed and seems to work fine

23
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:45,380
and this might raise a question in your case because in the previous video, I added the top zero and

24
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:53,000
left zero declarations to make sure that the navigation bar is stick to the left top of the viewport.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,340
Now the reason for that was that we had a margin in our HTML element, if I add a HTML selector right

26
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:10,480
here like that and add a margin of for example 10 pixels or maybe make 30, so that it becomes really clear

27
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,250
like that

28
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,700
and if I now reload the page, you can see that now the element is not positioned correctly.

29
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:25,090
That's what you always have to keep in mind, as soon as you add a margin to the HTML element or the body

30
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:34,560
element or basically any parent element of your header, then you have to add the top zero and left

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,300
zero declarations in case you want to stick this navigation bar to the left top of

32
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,810
your page,

33
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,920
sorry for that.

34
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,950
Now with that, we can see that although we edit this margin to our HTML element, the navigation bar

35
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,060
is now displayed correctly,

36
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,130
however we don't need that margin so we can delete it again, like that to make sure we have a clean code

37
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,470
and as we can see, now it looks really fine,

38
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,720
the only thing that's not looking fine of course is the image and the slogan. As I said, we'll fix that

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,450
soon but fixing that will only work if we learn about more values,

40
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,260
the absolute and relative values for the position property

41
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:23,970
but if we go to the packages page, then I can see something which we can already change because like

42
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,540
for the uHost page right here, I would like to have a background image

43
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,580
also on this page. The difference should be that this background image should not be only in parts or

44
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,840
on parts of our website, like here,

45
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,120
it should be the background image of the entire website and it also should move,

46
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,440
so it should be kind of a fixed background image. As we want to have such a fixed background image, using

47
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,270
the fixed value might not be the worst idea.
