1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,360
So how does the font shorthand work?

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,970
Well, let's have a look at that at the example of our package info class right here

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:17,410
once again. The font shorthand is simply added by writing the font property,

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,710
this one right here.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,750
Now for the font shorthand, we can use different values,

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,550
there are values which are optional and some values are a must.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:34,560
Additionally, the order of the values is important, so it needs to have the right order to work correctly.

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,500
Now let's start with the two must values,

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,770
the first must value is the font size which will be 1.2rem in our case, right here,

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,170
this means we can comment out this code for a moment, right here and right there.

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,560
So that's the first must value, the font size,

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,850
the second value we always have to add is our font family.

13
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:03,550
Well we have the font family right here, so we can simply add AnonymousPro or sans-serif, right here

14
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,200
to our code and comment it out right here

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,790
and note how I add it right here, we simply add value after value.

16
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,350
If I do that and save now and reload the page, you can see there is no difference at all,

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,750
so everything stays the way it is.

18
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:28,040
However, I told you that these are the values we need to have but there are more optional values that

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:34,830
we can include right here in our shorthand. One value we have right here which we can include is the font

20
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,480
weight.

21
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,170
So let me comment that out right here and the font weight

22
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,670
and that's important

23
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:47,410
has to be positioned ahead of the font size, so you simply add 700 right here

24
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:54,980
for example. If we do that and reload the page again, you can see nothing changed.

25
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,250
So this is how we can add the font weight right here.

26
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,130
We also have other properties which we can add,

27
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,740
this is for example the font variant, we talked about that.

28
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:13,780
So if I add small caps right here like we did it and we load the page again like that, then everything

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:20,290
right here is displayed with these small caps, also something we talked about and again, have a look

30
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,520
at the order.

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,470
The important thing is that the font variant right here, this one and the font weight are positioned

32
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,360
ahead of the actual font size,

33
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,540
that's really important to keep in mind.

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,260
Another value we can position in front of the actual font size is the font

35
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,220
style, the font style could be italic in our case, like that.

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,980
If we go back and reload the page again, you can see that we now have this italic style.

37
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,830
Now let me quickly add a comment down here to show you what you're doing right here.

38
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,870
We have the font style right here,

39
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,160
then we had the font variants, then we have the font weight right here,

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,910
then we have our font size, then we have the font family.

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,740
That's what we added so far

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,030
and the important thing really is that these three properties are positioned ahead of the font size, like

43
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:30,220
that, that font family is the last value we specify and that font size is directly coming after

44
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,080
these three values we have.

45
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,520
It sounds really complicated

46
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,870
as you can see but this is something you simply have to keep in mind or look up if you need it,

47
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,510
you can find the link to the MDN attached to the article in this video,

48
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,410
so this is a good resource to look that up and to keep that in mind

49
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:54,130
but if you look at these values or these properties we applied so far, you can see that one property

50
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,010
is missing

51
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:04,150
and this is the line height. Line height is added directly after the font size, like that and now it gets

52
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,830
really confusing, right because what should this mean?

53
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:14,530
Well this basically means that if we want to have a certain line height, then we simply add the slash

54
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,110
and two for example,

55
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,680
this simply means we added a line height of a number of two

56
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:27,880
and if we go back and reload the page, you can see that the line height increased and we can inspect

57
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,530
that of course, right here inside our class, this one

58
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,280
and if we now go down, we can see a line height of 38.2

59
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:44,650
but if I again zoom out right here, then we have our well-known 38 line height that we learned in the line

60
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,080
height lecture right here.

61
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,150
Let me zoom in again, that you can see everything

62
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,380
and that's actually the first purpose of this font

63
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:58,860
shorthand. You can combine all these different properties and corresponding values, like that.

64
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,040
As I said, keep in mind to start with these three properties in case you have them,

65
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:11,610
then continue with the font size in combination with the line height and then add the font family always

66
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,850
as the last property or value right here in the shorthand.

67
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,490
Another way to use this form shorthand is to refer to system fonts,

68
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,530
now what does that mean?

69
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,820
Well let me first maybe delete everything we don't need right here,

70
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:35,260
we don't need the line height and we don't need italic and small caps but the rest can be kept for

71
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,930
our shorthand

72
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,450
because we wrote it like that,

73
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,930
so let's keep it in here, like that.

74
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,150
So we got our shorthand,

75
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,750
let's see if it's still working, if I reload page,

76
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,530
yes

77
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,120
we have to close the curly braces,

78
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,500
that would help here.

79
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,250
So let's see if I now reload the page,

80
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,580
yes I think we got the look back from the beginning but now we simply wrote our shorthand right here.

81
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,240
With that, we can delete the font size right here

82
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,290
and also the font family and the font weight.

83
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,860
I won't correct it for the entire code now because I want to keep both variants right here

84
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:14,110
but here you can see that with our font shorthand, we can also easily define what our font should look

85
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,070
like.

86
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:22,840
Let me actually add this part right here back again, so that you have kind of a reminder of which properties

87
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,850
in which order you should add to this shorthand.

88
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:33,300
However, let me now also comment out our shorthand right here, like this and like that,

89
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:40,370
so this basically leads to the following look now of our website and let me now show

90
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,650
you the second option with the font shorthand referring to system fonts.

91
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:54,050
These system fonts or system font values simply refer to default font families which are applied to

92
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,440
different parts of your operating system,

93
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,850
this could be fonts which are used in menus for message boxes or for status bars for example.

94
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,370
Now talking about menus,

95
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,200
if I now add menu right here, like that and reload the page,

96
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,010
you can see that the font change to a font that is used for menus on the Mac

97
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:23,170
in my case right here. Another value would for example be a status bar which we could add right here

98
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,980
and as you can see, the font size now decreases for example, for such status bars.

99
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,390
So that's the second option we have when using this font shorthand,

100
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:40,850
it's either a shorthand as I showed you previously or you can also refer to such default system fonts.

101
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,610
Now to be honest, I don't think we need that right here, so we can get rid of it.

102
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,670
What we can also do now is we can comment in our font right here

103
00:07:51,770 --> 00:08:00,700
once again, like this and like that and we reload the page right here, so we have our style that we defined, our custom

104
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,370
style back in here

105
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:09,210
and with that, we also understood what the font shorthand is actually doing right here

106
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:16,750
and this brings me to the last core concept that I would like to show you as part of this module. I talked

107
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:23,350
about that already when we talked about the file types of our font families or the font formats, that

108
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:29,390
fonts can become quite big and therefore, performance is always a topic.

109
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,140
So let's have a look at font performance and how we can impact the loading behavior of our fonts

110
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,600
with the font display property.
