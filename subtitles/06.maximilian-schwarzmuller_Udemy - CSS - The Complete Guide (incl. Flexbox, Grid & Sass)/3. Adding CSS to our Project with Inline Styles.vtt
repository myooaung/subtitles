00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.490
So let's add some CSS to this page

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.590
and as I mentioned, there are three different ways of adding CSS, the first way you can use is inline

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.770
styling.

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:20.030
Now let's say we want to style this section here, we can add an inline style by adding the style attribute

5
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.170
to the section tag, the style attribute is a normal HTML attribute which you can actually add to pretty

6
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.780
much any HTML element.

7
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:37.970
Now you can simply set a CSS style by now applying a so-called CSS declaration inside of that style

8
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.290
attribute or inside of that string you pass as an argument

9
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.250
I could say. A declaration simply means that you define what you want to style and how you want to style

10
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.900
it.

11
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.440
Now the what is called a property

12
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.160
and here, we could say we want to set the background of this section.

13
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.280
Now how do I know that there is a background property? As you will learn throughout the course, there

14
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.610
first of all is a list of some properties you commonly use, so you will really see that you reuse the

15
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.610
same set of properties all the time and I will also show you a complete reference of all available

16
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.260
properties so you can really search for that single property you need for your case

17
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.130
but back to the background. As you might be able to guess, the background property styles the background

18
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.450
of this section and we could set it to a value,

19
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.540
now this is the part where we say how it should be styled. We assign such a value by adding a colon after

20
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.360
the property and then the value to which we want to set the background.

21
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.900
Now which value you use here depends on the property,

22
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.690
so for backgrounds, for example we can assign a color,

23
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.080
there also are other options like images which I'll also show later but for now, let's use a color

24
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.720
and you can either assign a color like red, just by typing this,

25
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.610
there is a set of predefined color so to say

26
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.570
but behind each such predefined color, there really is just a hex code you can use

27
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:15.560
and if you directly assign a hex code, you can actually mix or blend any color you want. A hex code

28
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.650
is assigned by adding a hashtag

29
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.380
and then the hex code value for a given color, I will show you how to find out the hex code value later.

30
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.170
So for now, let's simply add one

31
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.860
and I prepared one which has the hex code

32
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.690
#ff1b68, this is a nice reddish color.

33
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.450
Now if we save this file and we go back to the page and reload it, you should see that this section now

34
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.200
has a red background and that already is your first CSS code, this is how you can change the style

35
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.590
of an element, in this case, of the section.

36
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.470
Now this was achieved by creating a so-called inline style, inline because we use the style attribute

37
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.690
directly on the element where you want to add it and you would write all styles, if you have multiple

38
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.770
ones, you can separate them with semi-colons in the same line.

39
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:14.150
Now this approach is actually not recommended because if you create a bigger page with many styles, it

40
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.620
quickly becomes very hard to understand and read your code because your style is always applied to the

41
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.920
element you want to change.

42
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.600
If you ever want to change a style, you have to find that element in your document flow and this is

43
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.030
really hard to debug.

44
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.890
Additionally if you add multiple rules, let's say you have like 10 different properties you want to change,

45
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.170
you get a very long list of properties you assign here and that also is hard to read.

46
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.930
So there is a better way of writing CSS and that way actually uses so-called selectors.

47
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.820
Let's dive into that approach

48
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.320
and then the two remaining alternatives of including CSS code in the next video.
