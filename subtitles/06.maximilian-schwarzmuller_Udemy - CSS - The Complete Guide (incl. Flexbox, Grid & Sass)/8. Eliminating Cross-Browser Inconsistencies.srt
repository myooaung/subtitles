00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,190
So as you probably guessed by now, developing for the web isn't trivial

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:12,910
because we need to support many browsers, at least in some of our pages we need to do that.

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,190
Another problem we face

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:22,180
besides some features not being supported in some browsers are cross-browser inconsistencies, this means

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,680
that different browsers use different defaults.

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:32,590
You remember this default styling some elements get? The default font size of h1 tags, the default

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:38,740
font family which gets used, things like that, browsers implement that differently. For some elements, we

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:45,310
might have different margins or paddings, different box sizing behavior, that box sizing is set to border

9
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:51,290
box in some browsers for some elements by default for example and so on.

10
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,970
This is not necessarily bad, different browsers offer different defaults and some users might pick

11
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,800
a browser because of some of the defaults it offers

12
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,700
but some defaults are also annoying and you want to have a consistent look of your webpage across

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,450
browsers too.

14
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,120
Therefore, you can implement some reset libraries like normalize.css,

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,380
which is a CSS package you add as one of the first imports or as the first import in your

16
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:26,500
HTML file, which basically overwrites some of the global browser defaults.

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,410
So for example, this could set box sizing to border box for all elements or you do that manually of

18
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,400
course.

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,400
For example in our code, in the shared.css file, we are doing such a reset with a universal selector

20
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,070
where we set box sizing to border box.

21
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,060
This is one of the things normalize.css or other packages like it might do for you,

22
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,360
you can of course do it on your own.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:57,100
Now very important to keep in mind, if you use a package like normalize.css which resets a bunch of

24
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:03,170
things, that of course is additional code your users need to download and therefore, this increases

25
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,490
the size of your page so to say.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,950
Still, it might be worth it but there are a lot of arguments these days that maybe it's just better to

27
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,590
do that box sizing reset because that really is annoying if it doesn't work like this and not reset

28
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:24,700
anything else but simply overwrite things, like font sizes, like font families or colors if you work with

29
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:31,100
that specific element which actually is affected because you could also argue that packages like normalize.css

30
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,730
reset

31
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:39,080
a lot of styles which might never be used in your page because you never use that element which it resets.

32
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,290
For example if you never use a select element, it doesn't matter to you if the styles for it are reset

33
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,660
globally or not.

34
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,880
So keeping in mind that resetting some features makes sense and that you can do it manually with the

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,960
star selector or by using packages is definitely something which is important.
