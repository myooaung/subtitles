1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,470
Now what is the third rule to remember when it comes to the positioning units?

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,010
Well, no surprise right here, we have an element,

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,670
again we apply the percentage unit to it

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,600
and this time we have,

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,990
well what do we have?

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,280
We have positioned static or position relative applied right here.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:28,670
If that is the case, then the containing block again is an ancestor, like we had it before but this time,

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,440
it's only the content of the ancestor,

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,130
so not content and padding like we had it before when our element had the position absolute declaration

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,750
applied but with position static or relative, 

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,580
it's only the content.

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,020
Now how do we now identify the containing block,

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,960
so which is the ancestor we refer to?

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,970
Well the answer is there is simply the closest ancestor which is a block level element

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,830
and with that, we can now finish this slide actually and jump back to our project and see if we can also

16
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,370
find an example for our third rule to remember in our project.

17
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:12,980
So what we need is basically an element which has a percentage unit applied already maybe and which

18
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,230
is either not positioned at all,

19
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,690
so position static or relatively positioned.

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:26,300
Now if we go to our customers page right here, then I think that our image container might be a good

21
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,410
example for that.

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:36,650
So if we go into our main element right here, then we can see that we have our div, this name div right here, this wrapping

23
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,070
div, then we have the testimonial class

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,780
and inside this testimonial class, we have this image container right here.

25
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,130
If we scroll down, we can see we apply the width of 65%,

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:55,050
I showed you that in the beginning of this module also but we don't have any position property applied.

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,240
From a code perspective, we can find that if we go to the customers folder and to this index.html

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:10,760
file and right here, you can see the testimonial class and here, the testimonial image container.

29
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,900
So these are the classes we will probably work with now.

30
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,410
So let's now open the customer.css file

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,480
and here we need the testimonial image container class right here

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:33,750
because what we will do now is, we will now increase the width of this container from 65% to 100%,

33
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,090
like that.

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,340
If I do that and reload the page, you can see that the image increased dramatically.

35
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,050
Now why is this happening?

36
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,980
Well, because our element right here,

37
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:57,560
so this one, this testimonial class now takes the closest ancestor which is a block level element, which

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,470
is the case for this div right here with the testimonial class as the containing block.

39
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:15,330
And if we inspect that right here and go down there, we can see that this div has a width of 912

40
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:22,410
pixels and with that, our testimonial image container now also has this width applied because

41
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:31,040
that's the width of 100%. If I would reduce that width now, right here, to 50% for example,

42
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:40,100
like that and go back and reload the page, the image would decrease again because let's see, the containing

43
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,490
block still has a width of 912 pixels, you can see it right here

44
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,740
but the div inside of it,

45
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,220
so our element with the percentage unit now only has half of it.

46
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:59,540
That's also really important, it refers to 50% of the actual content, as we can see right

47
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,190
here,

48
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,580
912 is the actual content.

49
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:13,020
This means if I go to our testimonial right here and now add a padding of let's say zero top and bottom

50
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:20,190
and 10 pixels left right and reload the page, we can see that we have some movement here and maybe

51
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,070
also slight movement of the image,

52
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,370
I told you it wouldn't change, let's

53
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,470
see why it changed.

54
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,210
Well this is the container,

55
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:35,590
the container now has a width of 892 pixels only and 10 padding or 20 padding.

56
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,110
You remember why, right?

57
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,270
Because we added box sizing border box to our project,

58
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,570
therefore if I add a padding to our element right here, well then the padding will be added and this

59
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,120
will decrease the width of our content.

60
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,750
The interesting thing though is that if everything work correctly,

61
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:02,680
our image now or our image container, sorry for that, should have a width of 50% of 892 which

62
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,980
should be 446.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,320
The interesting thing now is if I go back and change the position of our image container right here

64
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:20,930
to relative because you remember this third rule applies to both, position static and relative,

65
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,260
right here, if you remember the relative positioning,

66
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:31,320
we know that this should actually not have an impact on to our image right now or onto the positioning

67
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,160
of the image.

68
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,230
Let's see if this works,

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,030
if I reload the page, it looks still fine

70
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:46,810
and as we can see, the container of course still has 892 of width and the image still has 446 of

71
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,430
width.

72
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,520
So this is working for both static and relative positioning

73
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,760
but what happens now

74
00:05:52,930 --> 00:06:00,790
if I turn our container into an inline element? This will probably break the entire website

75
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,270
but let's see if the relation is fine.

76
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,940
So I will add display inline now,

77
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:17,540
see how this works because as I said, this third rule only applies if our element with the percentage unit

78
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,650
is static or relative and then it looks for the closest ancestor which is a block level element,

79
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,100
so by turning this div into an inline element, this should not be true anymore.

80
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:35,290
So let's reload the page, as we can see the page is a bit messed up but it's still working generally.

81
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:43,400
So if I now look for our testimonial class right here, you can see it only has a width of 744 pixels

82
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,500
now, why is this the case?

83
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,040
Because it's set to auto which makes sense as we have now an inline element

84
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,160
but what happened to our image container right here?

85
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,240
This still has a width of 456 pixels,

86
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,120
let me see,

87
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,600
we still have the width of 50% applied.

88
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
Now let's have a look at the index.html

89
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:10,270
file and see what the next ancestor could be, which is a block level element.

90
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,970
We can see this first ancestor, the testimonial class

91
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:19,820
is not working anymore because it's an inline element but this div now here, this wrapping div, this should

92
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:27,620
be the ancestor we need and if we inspect that div right here, then we can see that this div has a

93
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,410
width of 912 pixels

94
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,480
and with that, we found the answer to this question.

95
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:40,160
Now that this div is not a block level element anymore, the closest ancestor is this wrapping

96
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:47,410
div and with that, we changed the containing block from the testimonial class to this wrapping div.

97
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,330
So let's change this back again

98
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:58,010
otherwise we will kind of mess up our website right here and also remove the padding and change the

99
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:04,510
width of the image container back to 65% because this is where we have been and also remove the

100
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,410
position relative declaration down here, like that.

101
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,430
So if we reload the page now, everything looks the way it did before.

102
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:21,950
We now understand why this 65% value right here is referring to our testimonial class right there

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,980
because this is the closest ancestor which is a block level element

104
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,820
and with that, we also understood this third rule to remember.

105
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,470
However, there is one important thing that I would like to show you because whenever you work with the

106
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:44,390
height and a percentage unit in cases like that, then the containing block could lead to a behavior which

107
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,250
you would not expect.

108
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,880
Let's have a look at that behavior and how we can quickly fix it in the next video.
