00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.440
So which things do we have to know and to keep in mind regarding our media queries right here?

2
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.420
The first thing to keep in mind is what I told you already, the way you read such a media query is basically

3
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.060
like an if statement.

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.300
You basically say that if a condition that is specified right here is true, then the following code will

5
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.040
be applied,

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.060
that's the easiest way to remember such a media query

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.780
and based on my experience, also the most logical way.

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.350
That's the first thing to keep in mind,

9
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.780
think of media queries just like if statements

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.390
and this brings me to the second important thing that we have to keep in mind, because I mentioned it

11
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.520
before, we will now design our website from a mobile first perspective.

12
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.230
This means all our code outside the media queries is our mobile code,

13
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.310
so the code that specifies the look of our website on mobile devices

14
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.310
and with that, our media query logic so to say, the media query should kick in once we are above this

15
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.920
border,

16
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.770
so once our min width is equal or larger than the value we specify right here is true.

17
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.050
But of course, you could also create your website

18
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.210
the other way round

19
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.500
and although I do not recommend that, as I said we live in mobile times, so users will more and more access

20
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.320
your website from mobile devices,

21
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.450
so why not start creating a website with this mobile first approach

22
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.730
but you could of course also create your website desktop first.

23
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.090
This would basically mean that all the code we have right here is the code that makes sure that your

24
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.500
website looks good right here

25
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.260
in the desktop view, right here for example

26
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.840
and as you can see, we might have to work on the image again because apparently my changes were not the

27
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.850
smartest ones but we will have a look at that soon.

28
00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.220
However, this could be a starting point, you could say I built my website for desktop devices and my media

29
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.250
queries should only help me to define a mobile design.

30
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:13.740
Well then you would simply turn this min width right here into a max width because this simply tells you

31
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:24.270
that the media query should only kick in in cases where the maximum width of your viewport is equal

32
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.580
or smaller than the value you specify right here.

33
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.340
That's of course the other way round we do it right there because if we have a viewport that is for

34
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.090
example 13rem, then this code would be true. If we have a look at our code now, like that, let's

35
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.450
reload the page,

36
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:51.350
you can see that we have a smaller font size right here and if I would now decrease our size, like that, then

37
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:59.350
you would see that the font size gets bigger once we are equal or below our 640 pixels

38
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.310
but that's of course not the way we wanted to have right here because we want to build our website mobile

39
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.820
first,

40
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.180
so let's add min width right here, like that.

41
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.950
If we do that and reload the page, you can see we have a bigger font size right here.

42
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.680
But these are the two approaches you have; mobile first and desktop first and basically you are free

43
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.930
to choose whichever approach you want

44
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.960
but I will recommend building or using the mobile first approach.

45
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.330
The third thing that you should keep in mind is that you are of course not limited to a single media

46
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.240
query,

47
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.640
you could also add multiple media queries below each other,

48
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.680
for example if we copy that media query right here and add it right there, then we could say that we

49
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.580
do not want to have our website to be built for two devices, mobile and desktop for example, but we also

50
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.060
want to have a version for really large devices for example and let's say that the large devices

51
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.040
start right here at 60rem, for example

52
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.300
that's the second border we have, the second limit we have. There we could say that the height of our image

53
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.010
should be 50 and the font size should be 5rem for example,

54
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.290
that's also possible.

55
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.130
So as you can see, we have both media queries written below each other.

56
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.370
Now if we go back to our website and reload it, we can see that the behavior in the beginning remains

57
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.180
the same,

58
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.680
here we have our mobile design, then we have the border of 640 right here where the second design kicks

59
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.260
in

60
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.240
and if we make it bigger,

61
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.830
can you see it? Then

62
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.220
the third design kicks in right there

63
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.670
and that's also really important to keep in mind. You can have more than one media query at the same time,

64
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.920
that's not a problem because although this media query right here, our last one, is coming after this

65
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.950
one in the code,

66
00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.810
it will not overwrite the query right here, so the property right here, our font size 5rem will not

67
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.510
overwrite the 3rem we have in our other query because although it comes later in the code,

68
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:15.500
so based on the cascading nature we already know, you could assume that but as these properties will

69
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.130
only become true if there the query,

70
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.920
so if this if statement is true, this is not a problem at all.

71
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.920
So you can add multiple media queries below each other which are specifying different limits.

72
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.680
Of course if I would add the min width of 40rem right here like that, then this would be a problem

73
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.710
because then, it would be overwritten as you can see right here, because the media query right here is

74
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.230
true,

75
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.510
this is also true but this one comes later in the code,

76
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.140
therefore the cascading nature comes into play

77
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.880
and with that, only the rules right here would be applied

78
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.910
but as soon as you change different limits for your media queries, this is not a problem at all.

79
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.320
However there is one problem though because as I said, the code will just run from top to bottom and

80
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.660
apply the media queries according to their order basically

81
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.610
but this only works if you specify the order correctly.

82
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.770
This means you have the width right here with 40rem

83
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:22.090
and then you have the next border with 60rem. If you would turn that around and start with 60rem right here

84
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.320
and then go down to the 40rem,

85
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.670
what will basically happen then is your code goes from top to bottom and finds that this media query right

86
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.280
here is true,

87
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.810
so this if statement is met and this would lead to the following behavior, you would start right here

88
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.840
with your mobile design, then you have 640 pixels right here with our

89
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.830
first breaking point and this is OK as you can see right here,

90
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.460
we have our min width of 40rem

91
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:55.180
but the problem is that this is of course not true for all widths we have because the code simply

92
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.530
goes from top to bottom,

93
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.700
finds that this condition is met,

94
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.660
so it will always apply this code right here,

95
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.030
it cannot jump back to the 60rem of course.

96
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:13.030
Therefore the important thing is that you order your media queries according to the correct width.

97
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:19.420
This means you start with the smaller width right here, the 40rem and then with 60rem for the second

98
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.270
media query

99
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.240
and with that, we can now ensure that our browser always uses the media

100
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:31.420
query that applies now because we can see, we now have our two breaking points again because the browser

101
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.790
simply goes from top to bottom,

102
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.330
finds this query, says OK this is applied

103
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.820
and as soon as this if statement is true, it will apply that latest code right here.

104
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.270
So that's really important,

105
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:50.080
the order also matters right here for our media queries. So we can add multiple queries,

106
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.980
that's not a problem,

107
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:57.070
multiple media queries also targeting the same selectors and the same properties but we have to make

108
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:03.580
sure that our conditions are set correctly and in combination with that, we can really create different

109
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.270
stylings for our website for different devices.
