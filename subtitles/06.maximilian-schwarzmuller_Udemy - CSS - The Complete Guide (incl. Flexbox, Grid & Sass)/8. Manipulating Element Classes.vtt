00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.510
So we managed to open and close our modal,

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.740
now let me show you another way of doing that.

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.370
We could also add a new class,

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.230
let's name it open maybe and I'll add it to the shared.css file at the very bottom because it's not limited

5
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.620
to the mobile navigation. Open could set display to block

6
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:34.250
and now if we analyze our shared.js code, we actually can see that we always set our display

7
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:43.280
style to block or to none which for all the cases is the default of our CSS classes anyways.

8
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.400
So for the backdrop for example or the modal, display is none, the same for the backdrop, display is none by

9
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.450
default.

10
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.960
So we actually only need a second class, the open class which switches it to block when needed

11
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.930
and now we will just need to add this class via Javascript whenever we need to change the style.

12
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.920
This is what I want to show you now,

13
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.690
so for that we still need to select the elements, we still need to add listeners but we won't edit the

14
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.870
styles like this,

15
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.930
let me remove that or comment it out so that we still have it for reference,

16
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:29.330
instead we can access modal and then there is a class name property. Now class name actually is

17
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.100
a string which holds the same value as our class attribute here does,

18
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.990
so if we have one or more class here, it will still be one string with the words separated by whitespace,

19
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.140
just as we have it here.

20
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.440
Now we could change class name to open,

21
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.340
the problem with that is it would then really put class equal to open

22
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:03.620
and if we had other classes that shouldn't be removed, like for example for our backdrop, we don't want

23
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.460
to get rid of the backdrop class, we just want to add the open class, then with this approach, we would

24
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.120
actually overwrite it.

25
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.650
Now this div class backdrop would become div class open, not necessarily what we want

26
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.790
and the same for the modal here in this case actually.

27
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.540
So let me comment this out and add a comment here,

28
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:35.360
this will actually overwrite the complete class list and that already gives us a hint.

29
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.130
We can think of our classes on an element as a list of classes,

30
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.930
so it would be nice if we had an easy way of adding and removing elements to and from that list.

31
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.180
Now we can do that with another property,

32
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.090
the class list property. This is an object which provides some helper methods, as you can see here, 

33
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.340
like for example for checking if it contains a certain class, this can be used in if conditions, for

34
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.820
adding a class or for removing a class or even for toggling a class which will automatically remove

35
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.430
it if it's active or added if it is not active.

36
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.460
Now you can work with toggle here,

37
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.330
I will use add and remove

38
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.440
and here in this case I want to add a class, the open class, without a dot at the beginning,

39
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.930
just a name and this will add a CSS class open to the modal and this is great because we got an open

40
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.590
class which will set all the styles we want to set.

41
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.100
This allows us to still access our or write our styles in stylesheets and then control the attachment

42
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:52.000
of that class with Javascript. Now I'll copy that and do the same for the backdrop. With that if we change

43
00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.610
that and we reload our page, if we click choose plan, we still open the backdrop but the modal actually doesn't

44
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.740
show up.

45
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.880
The reason for this is that the open class is added but it's overwritten by the modal class

46
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.530
and the reason for that is really that we defined the open class in the shared.css file whereas we have

47
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.240
the modal class in the main.css file which is imported as a second file and therefore as you

48
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:28.930
learned, this overwrites any styles with the same specificity that were defined earlier, like for our open

49
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.960
class.

50
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.870
So what we can do and here this really is OK, we can add important here,

51
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.810
I told you that you shouldn't really use this to overwrite specificity but here it's ok because

52
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:48.550
this really is a class that we only add when it should take absolute priority. Another solution would

53
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.550
be to simply reposition the modal class in front of the open class

54
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.220
but I think this approach is really OK here too.

55
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.130
So with that if we save that and reload,

56
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.860
now we actually see the modal too.

57
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.950
We can't get rid of it though because we now got important on our display property,

58
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.160
maybe one downside you could say but we want to get rid of it in another way

59
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:20.560
anyways, I want to go to my close modal function here and not set the styles with the old approach

60
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:27.380
but instead use my class lists again and simply remove the open class with this code

61
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.800
and the same for the backdrop.

62
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:36.850
Now with that if we save again and we reload, we can open our modal and close it, just like that

63
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.960
but this time if you watch here on the right, you'll see that not the inline styles get edited but the class

64
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:52.770
list gets edited automatically simply by running the add and remove commands on the class list.

65
00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:00.070
Of course, we can do the same for the mobile nav. We can comment it out here and use mobile nav class

66
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:06.830
list remove open here because that's the backdrop click, we want to close it here

67
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:15.840
but also down there on the toggle button, there I actually want to call add and the same of course for

68
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.310
the backdrop.

69
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.920
Now if we reload, we can actually open the modal still and also the side menu,

70
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.870
this all works just nice now.

71
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:35.850
So with that, we're using a different approach, the class list and that is the other great and important way you

72
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.220
have of editing elements.
