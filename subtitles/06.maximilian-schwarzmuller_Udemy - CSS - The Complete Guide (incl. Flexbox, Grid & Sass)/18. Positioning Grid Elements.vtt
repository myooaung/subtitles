00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.890
Now that we worked on our page quite a bit,

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:11.260
let's go back to some theory in quotation marks because we'll of course still stay in a web project

3
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.680
and move things around and let's learn how we can actually position the elements in a grid in case we're

4
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.270
not happy with the default positioning.

5
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:28.630
So back in our project, right now we have a certain positioning of the elements in a grid that we never questioned.

6
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.620
They're always taking the full size of their cell, both on the horizontal and the vertical axis,

7
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.380
they always stretch the full cell

8
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.880
and there of course maybe the behavior you want but sometimes, it's not what you want and you got a couple

9
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.230
of properties that help you with positioning elements in the grid. You add them on the grid container,

10
00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:02.060
so on the container class selector in our case here. The first one is justify items,

11
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.290
if you set this to center, let's see what happens. 

12
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:14.450
Let's reload and now what we can see if we turn on that grid inspection again, is that in our grid cells

13
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.140
or the grid tracks actually, so the areas where a certain element is positioned in, like the green element

14
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.540
here actually has the first row,

15
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.210
don't forget, now it's positioned in the center of that area, so the green element is in the center of

16
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.070
its row,

17
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.640
the red element is in the center of its two cells here where it's assigned to and the yellow element is

18
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.640
just in the center of its cell, the blue element again is in the center of its entire track.

19
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.880
So this is now what justify items does,

20
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.460
it positions the elements in their grid tracks,

21
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.000
so in their areas

22
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.950
so to say. We also can assign a value of start there,

23
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.120
now this moves them to the start of their respective track,

24
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.950
so green and blue are at the start of their rows, red is at the start of its area

25
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.580
and yellow is at the start of its cell, since it's only assigned to a single cell

26
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.290
and we also got end of course which moves them to the end. And important, start and end does not mean left

27
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.120
and right, it means start and end depending on the read direction of the browser the users use,

28
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:31.400
so if someone is accessing the page with settings set to right-to-left reading, then start will

29
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.690
actually be on the right instead of on the left,

30
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.210
that's just a little side note.

31
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.750
So this is justify items, now

32
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.850
the default is stretch.

33
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.390
So you don't need to set this,

34
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.610
this is the default behavior you saw at the beginning.

35
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.840
Now this was the positioning within their rows so to say,

36
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.680
now if you want to position them within their columns, you got align items,

37
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.690
now this can also be set to center for example. If you set align items to center and you reload,

38
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.890
now the elements are vertically centered in their tracks,

39
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.150
so in their columns basically. And of course here, you also got start as an option,

40
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:20.510
start moves them to the start of their row or of their area and you got end too,

41
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.090
end will of course simply move them to the very end of their row.

42
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.110
And now you might already have guessed it, the default here also is stretch,

43
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.990
you don't need to set this, this is what you started with.
