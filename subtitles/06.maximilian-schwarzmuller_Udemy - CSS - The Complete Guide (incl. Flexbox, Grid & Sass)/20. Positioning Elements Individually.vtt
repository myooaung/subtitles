00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.360
Now we had a detailed look at how you can position the grid and the grid cells,

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.100
now sometimes you want to position one element in a certain way that differs from the other elements.

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.620
So for example here, all the elements,

4
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.560
so now I'm talking about the items in the grid again, all the elements are set to stretch both on the x

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.540
and the y-axis.

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.650
Now what if you actually wanted to set element two,

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.360
so the red one to be centered both horizontally and vertically in its box?

8
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.250
Well you can overwrite the positioning for a single element by going to that element's selector,

9
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.820
so I'm talking about the red one, element too,

10
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:52.440
so it's the el2 selector and there, you can set justify self. Justify self positions it on the x-axis,

11
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.230
so we could set this to center here and now if we go back and reload, you see now it's not stretching

12
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.920
on the x-axis anymore

13
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.540
and of course therefore we also have align self to position it on the y-axis and

14
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.590
we can set this to center too.

15
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.030
And now all the other elements still have the stretch setting, which is set by the parent, by the container

16
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.730
but this element two overwrites it for this element only because there, we assign justify and align self.

17
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.070
And this is also very useful to know and something which can be helpful with

18
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.630
your next project where you might not want to position all elements in the grid equally.
