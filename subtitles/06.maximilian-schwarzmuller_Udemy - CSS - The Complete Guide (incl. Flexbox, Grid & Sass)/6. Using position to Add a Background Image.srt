1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,060
So our navigation works fine,

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:10,610
also on the packages page but now we want to add a background image to this page right here.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,870
For that, we have to go back to our code and open two files.

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,750
We have to go to the packages folder and open this index.html

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,380
file right here and the packages.css file,

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,770
so both files that are inside this folder basically.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:30,450
Now as we want to add a background image right here, we first need an element that contains this actual

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,680
background image.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,360
Next we'll dive deeper into background images in the next video,

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:41,540
so I will keep it rather short in this video because the focus really is on the position property,

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,510
so in case some things might be unclear, don't worry, we'll dive into that in the next module.

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,070
However, we could add this containing element maybe right here,

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,770
basically above the header, this could be a simple div without any content

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:03,000
but with the class background, like that.

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,470
Now with this class being added, we might also need a background image. To add this,

16
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,220
we need a new folder or we can use a new folder,

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,910
it's not necessarily required to save these images in new folders but to keep things structured,

18
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:25,900
I think it makes sense to do it like this and we shouldn't create that images folder in the packages

19
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,780
folder though,

20
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:32,770
we should create it right here, like this, so it should be on the same level as the packages folder and

21
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,700
now attached to this video,

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,930
you can find an image which you can use for that, 

23
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:43,930
this is the plans-background.jpg which you can then simply drag and drop into the folder.

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:50,470
If you do that, you will see that this image right here with the MacBook and the coffee is added to our

25
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,860
folder right here.

26
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:58,630
So this is nice but now we need to add this image to our background and for that, we have to go to the

27
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,520
packages.css

28
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:07,080
file and now we have to add the background selector first. So we created that class, so let's create

29
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,120
a background right here

30
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,860
and the first thing we have to do is we have to add the background property.

31
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,740
What we then need is a URL which refers to our image and for that, we need to make sure to add these quotation

32
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,580
marks,

33
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,180
now we have to move one level up because remember, we are in the packages folder,

34
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:33,760
so we have to go onto the same level as the images folder, then add a slash, then go to the images folder

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,090
and then refer to plans-background, this file right here,

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,450
.jpg,

37
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,060
plans-background.jpg, like that  

38
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,210
and don't forget about the semi-colon.

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,220
If we now go back and reload the page, we can see that not a lot changed apparently.

40
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,670
So let's go back and let's maybe add a width

41
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:09,710
of 100% and also a height of also 100%. If we do that, maybe this helps,

42
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,630
let's see,

43
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,460
then we see that this is also not working.

44
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's maybe try pixels then, as you can see without the position property,

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,770
this is not really a nice thing to do.

46
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,680
So let's maybe add a width of 500 pixels and also a height of 500 pixels,

47
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:35,810
so let's see what happens then. If we do that, yes we can see that we now at least got an image

48
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,060
but as we can see, we have issues with the percentage values and the image is of course not being displayed

49
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,950
completely because of pixels we added

50
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,540
and more importantly, we can see why the position fixed declaration might be helpful right here because

51
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,120
the image on the starting page was part of the actual document flow,

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,950
it was positioned above the other elements right here.

53
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:05,630
But on the packages page, the image should be positioned behind our actual content on the website,

54
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,200
therefore doing it like this will not make us happy.

55
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:17,510
Therefore let's go back and let's now add the position property with the fixed value right here.

56
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:26,520
If we do that and now reload the page, yes then we can see as expected hopefully that it kind of works

57
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:33,510
because as we learned already, with this value, we take the image or the element out of the actual

58
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,530
document flow and therefore it doesn't exist for the other elements

59
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,090
and because of that, it is positioned, well at the moment, above the other elements,

60
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,260
we will fix that soon

61
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,450
but generally we're coming closer to where we want to be.

62
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:55,340
Now we can go back and also change the height and width to 100% right here, like this and like that,

63
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,080
let's see if it works now

64
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,370
and as we can see, the image indeed covers the entire viewport,

65
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,320
so that's basically working now

66
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,400
but if I now increased the width,

67
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,730
well we can also see that the image is not correctly sized. At the moment the image is just displayed

68
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,070
in its original size

69
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,900
and as the viewport is smaller, well the image could actually also be a bit smaller.

70
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,530
However we will dive deeper into background sizing in the next module,

71
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,830
therefore for the moment we will keep that solution and continue our work.

72
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:34,440
The important thing for the moment though is that we added this background image but it's called a background

73
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:42,060
image but somehow, it is displayed in front of the other images and that's actually not the way it should

74
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,280
be displayed.

75
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:50,210
Therefore in the next video, we will have a look at the z-index and at the stacking context. Now what

76
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:56,550
are these, how it works and how it is connected to the fact that the background image is now displayed

77
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,590
in front of the other images,

78
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,000
let's find that out in the next video.
