1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,760
So how does this percentage unit work, what does it refer to?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,500
For that, I prepared for three rules to remember and we will have a look at each of these rules separately

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,680
and also have a look at our project to see how these rules apply in practice.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,860
Now let's dive into it right now

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,720
and the starting point of course is an element.

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:32,590
So this is the element we applied a percentage unit to, for example to the width property.

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,230
Now the important thing is that this is a special element.

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,360
Why is it special?

9
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:47,500
Because it has this declaration also applied, position fixed and by the way, that's also how you can see

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,070
how things tie together in this course because although we will not position our elements in this module,

11
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:01,440
the position property definitely has an impact on the way the percentage unit behaves.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,020
Now how does this impact work?

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:11,730
Well the reference point for such an element with a percentage unit is called the containing block, this containing

14
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:19,260
block is simply for example an element, a parent element for example which has a width of let's say 100

15
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,760
pixels applied.

16
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:28,080
If this parent is the containing block and we will find out in this in the next videos how we can identify

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:36,240
the containing block, well then our child, so our element right here, would have a width of let's say 10 pixels

18
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,770
if we applied a width of 10% to it, so 10% width of a child would be 10 pixels if the

19
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,640
containing block has a width of 100 pixels.

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,750
Now the issue is that the containing block depends on the position property applied to our element right here

21
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,500
and in case the position property or the value for this property that we applied is fixed, then the

22
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,400
containing block is not an element, it's the viewport

23
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,270
and that's actually quite nice because if you remember back the position module, then we also had that

24
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,830
relationship between a fixed positioned element and the viewport.

25
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,080
However as I said, this time it's not about positioning,

26
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,990
so let's go back onto our website and see how this behaves in practice.

27
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:32,380
So I'm back on the customers page but I'm actually more interested into our nav bar right here because this

28
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:38,520
nav bar if we inspect it, as we can see it has the position fixed declaration applied

29
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:45,770
and as we just saw because of that, this width of 100% should refer to the viewport.

30
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,540
A good indication is that if we change the size of the viewport like that, we can also see that the

31
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,990
nav part changes

32
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,320
but let's play around a bit with the width to really make sure that this is the case. For that,

33
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,470
let's remember that we now have a width of 882 pixels.

34
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:10,800
This means if I go back to code and not to the customers.css file but to the shared.css file

35
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,850
because that's where our header is located or the selector of our header

36
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,670
and right here we need this class selector named header.

37
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,970
Right here, we have the 100%

38
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:29,060
and if I now reduce it to 50% let's say and go back and reload the page, we can see that the nav

39
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,910
bar decreased its size to only 50%,

40
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,890
so this should be as we can see it

41
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,270
441 pixels,

42
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,420
before we had 882,

43
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,090
so 50% now.

44
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,790
And more interestingly if I increase the size of the viewport right here by increasing it, we can see

45
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,600
that the nav bar also increases and decreases,

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,550
so basically we can change it back to 100% like that and reload the page because with that, we understood

47
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:06,930
that whenever we have an element which has the position fixed declaration applied and a percentage unit,

48
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,890
well the containing block is the viewport.

49
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,930
This was the first rule to remember.
