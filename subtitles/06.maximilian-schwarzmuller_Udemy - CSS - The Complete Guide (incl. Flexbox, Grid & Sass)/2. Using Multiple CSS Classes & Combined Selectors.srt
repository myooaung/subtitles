1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:07,550
More on CSS classes. We used CSS class selectors quite a bit,

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,980
they're very useful,

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:15,250
we can define reuseable rules with them and apply them to any element which should receive the rule

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:21,340
and here are two additional things I want to bring to your attention. In this HTML snippet here, we

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,470
see that we got two elements and the first one actually got more than one class applied to it,

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:34,300
it got class 1 and class 2 and the two classes are simply separated by a whitespace between them and

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,880
the second element is a normal link which has just one class but we'll select it in a special way.

8
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:45,290
So for the first element, important, you can use multiple classes on one element,

9
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,090
that is something I want to emphasize. So the two rules we have

10
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,970
here on the left would both be applied independently to that element because that element has the

11
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,390
same class. Now important,

12
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:03,310
if you got two classes applied to the same element and they both happened to set a certain style on

13
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:09,670
the element, then the normal specificity and order rules will apply, the order in this class list here

14
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,820
is not important regarding this.

15
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,460
Now for the second element, the anchor tag,

16
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,120
I also get a nice style, here

17
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:25,180
we actually use a combinator, it's not officially a combinator but we still use a combined selector here

18
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,960
somehow.

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,970
We got a tag collector and then our class selector

20
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:37,660
and if you look closely, there's no whitespace between the two selectors, also no plus or anything else.

21
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:45,580
So they're written as one word you could say and that simply means this targets an element which is

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,440
an anchor tag and which has the active CSS class and to such an element, the following styles will

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,400
get applied.

24
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,370
This can of course target more than one element because you could have more than one anchor tag with

25
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,480
the active class

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,490
and this also is not limited to tag class selector combinations,

27
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:10,150
you could have two classes, you could have an ID in a class or a tag as with a class is here or a tag with

28
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,320
two classes.

29
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:18,490
You can simply chain selectors into one selector to be more specific about what you want to select.

30
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:25,660
The difference to a combinator here is that we're not selecting an element with the active class that's

31
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,220
nested in an element which is an anchor tag

32
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:36,040
but we want to select an anchor tag that has the active class and we didn't encounter a combinator that

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,240
would allow us to do that yet because there is none, this is the way to achieve this.

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,500
Now let's see this in practice. Attached to this video,

35
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,530
you'll find a little starting code snippet, in the HTML code,

36
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,820
I just got some dummy elements, navigation with the links and then two sections with IDs and classes

37
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,640
and in the main.css file,

38
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,430
some basic styles are set up.

39
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,080
Nothing we haven't seen before,

40
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,890
just a bunch of tag collectors and one class selector, we're setting height, border, padding and some colors,

41
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,890
so really nothing fancy.

42
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:13,630
Please note that I'm using shorthands all the time except for margin bottom because I really just

43
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,220
want to set the margin bottom here and it leads to this layout

44
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,280
if we load this page.

45
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,110
Now let's see or check that case where we got the two classes on one element.

46
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,330
We don't have such a case in th HTML code right now, so let's create one,

47
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:36,820
let's maybe add a second class to that first section, maybe highlighted.

48
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:44,290
So now, this first section has two CSS classes applied to it and they're totally independent from each

49
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:44,610
other,

50
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,960
they just sit on the same section but we could reuse any of the classes anywhere else in our document.

51
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:59,440
Important, they're separated by a whitespace, so no comma, no semi-colon, just a whitespace and important,

52
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:05,980
if both classes happen to define a style for the same property, the normal specificity and order rules

53
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,600
apply and therefore the class which is defined later in the file would win.

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:17,790
Well let's actually see that. We got our main section class down here and as you can see, it sets a border.

55
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,560
Now let's create this highlighted class which we just added to the same element and there, let's

56
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,180
say we want to have a border of 2 pixels, solid and in this orange color here.

57
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,150
Now if we add this and we reload the page, we can see that style getting applied to that first section

58
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,970
and if we open the developer tools, we can see that if we inspect that first element, both classes are

59
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,500
obviously applied there too

60
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,630
and if we have a look at the styles which are having an effect, we see that both the main section and

61
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,510
the highlighted class are doing their job and the highlighted class wins regarding the border simply

62
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,730
because it's defined later in the file.

63
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,600
If we switch the order in the file here and we reload, then it doesn't win,

64
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,130
so the order in the class definition here is not important.

65
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,870
So let's go back and revert the order again because I want to have that orange border and with that,

66
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,400
this is really all that's to it,

67
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,540
this is the case that we apply two or more classes to the same element,

68
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,360
you can add as many as you want.

69
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,840
Now let's have a look at that combined selector,

70
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,550
for example this first anchor tag is not just an anchor tag,

71
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,630
it also has the active class,

72
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,020
the second one doesn't have that class.

73
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,490
Now let's say we want to give that first anchor tag a special style,

74
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,810
here's our normal anchor tag rule,

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,170
now let's create a new selector, a new rule here and there I'll directly add the active class.

76
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,440
Now if I were to put a whitespace between the anchor tag and the active class selector here, then this

77
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,200
would actually target elements that have the active class, that have a direct or indirect parent which

78
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,570
is an anchor tag.

79
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,340
Now this would not match any elements on our page because we got no such case,

80
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,320
there is no nested HTML element in any of our anchor tags, leave alone that it would have this class,

81
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:16,140
we just got an anchor tag which directly has the class and to target that, we need to remove the

82
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,900
whitespace

83
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:22,770
and now we're saying apply whatever styles we're defining here to an anchor tag which has the active

84
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,380
class applied to itself.

85
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,980
By the way, you can of course also combine this with an ID,

86
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:34,160
this would target all anchor tags that have some ID, which should at most be one on our page,

87
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,960
it's none

88
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,430
but back to the active class, so we can combine selectors like this and there, we could say this should

89
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,460
actually have some purple color, let's say.

90
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,760
So here I am defining a purple color, hex code #521751

91
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,450
and now with that if we reload the page,

92
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:58,740
this first link looks different. So that is really important to understand and to know, you can work with

93
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,020
selectors like this,

94
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,950
you can combine them.

95
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:07,520
It's not an official combinator but it's still useful to target elements more precisely.
