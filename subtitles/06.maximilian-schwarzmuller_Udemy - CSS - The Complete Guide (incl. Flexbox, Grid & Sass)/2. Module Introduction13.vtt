00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.780
Welcome to this module.

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.460
So we finished the actual styling of our website,

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.730
we have a responsive design which works quite well,

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.720
so actually, we are done.

5
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.420
Well yes and no,

6
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.620
we could keep the page as it is in the current status, the general functionality is fine but there are more

7
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.160
things to be added and one of these thinjgs is flexbox because as you can see right here, it's the

8
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.350
modern way to change the way our elements are displayed,

9
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.790
so it's basically another value for the display property

10
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.560
but a really special value which allows us to add a lot more flexibility to our elements.

11
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.850
So what will we learn in this module then?

12
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.980
Well, we will have a look at the flex container,

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.380
this is basically the element, the display flex declaration, so the special flexbox property you could

14
00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.070
say will be applied to. In addition to that, we'll have a look at the difference between the main axis

15
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.210
and the cross axis, a specific concept we need to understand to understand flexbox and we'll have

16
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.130
a look at the flex items,

17
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.160
these are basically the items inside our flex container. We'll of course also dive into the different

18
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.210
properties we have and have to look at all the core functionalities of flexbox.

19
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.850
So that's what's inside this module,

20
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.620
let's now have a look at our project and see where we have

21
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.780
certain areas that could be improved.
