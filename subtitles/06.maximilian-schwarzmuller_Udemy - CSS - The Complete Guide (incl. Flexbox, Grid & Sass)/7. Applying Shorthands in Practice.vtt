00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.830
Let's quickly see shorthands in action then. As I said, we already use shorthands,

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.320
the backgrounds are shorthand,

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.080
the padding actually is a shorthand,

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.950
it works like the margin. Margin is one,

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.840
here we use the longer form,

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:22.380
now we can get rid of that and instead simply use border 5 pixels solid black or any other order of

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.420
these values.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.550
The margin here of course is a shorthand

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.990
and with that, let's inspect that in the developer tools and see how they can help us with that.

10
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.820
If we again select the first section where we have padding, border, margin and background, so where we

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.350
already have four shorthands, in the developer tools you can always click this tiny arrow here to see which

12
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.700
long form properties are combined.

13
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.040
And here you see all the properties that make up the background,

14
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.760
again this is something I'll dive into later,

15
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.350
this is simply a very complex way since you can also use background images which you can then position

16
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.720
with the various subproperties, for solid colors, they don't matter

17
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.670
but there you see, we implicitly set background color by assigning a color to background.

18
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.790
So this would be the long form property name,

19
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.430
background color. For the padding,

20
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.220
we see that this could be split up into padding top, right, bottom and left

21
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.560
and it works as I said, just like the margin and for the border, we see actually we got a bit more.

22
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.580
We don't just have border style, color and width, we can even set long form properties for the different

23
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.240
sides,

24
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.800
so for the top border, we could style that differently than the bottom border.

25
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.200
So this is how shorthands are combined here

26
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.340
and this is just something to be aware of,

27
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.750
you can always use the long form and if you just want to set a margin top for example, it's better to

28
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.780
just set margin top rather than margin with the four values syntax and then set three of them to zero.

29
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.640
But you can always use both

30
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.120
and behind the scenes, this is what will get rendered.
