1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,950
So when we click on a button, we get this blue outline, another browser default. You can inspect it

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:15,120
in the developer tools by selecting the button and then clicking on this pseudo selector hov thing here.

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:21,210
If you click on it, you can toggle different states because otherwise, it's not really possible to inspect

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,940
the active state for example. Here you can check active and now you see what the button will look like if it's

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,610
active.

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,890
You can also see this is the style we assign for it

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,150
but this does not have the blue color, for that,

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,670
you need the focus pseudo selector. The focus pseudo selector is available for input fields,

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,760
so both text input fields as well as buttons which also handle user input

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,280
and it basically is applied or becomes active whenever a user has this focused, which of course is the

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,640
case if the the user clicks it

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,850
but also if the user circles around with tab, so there you can also set the focus state. So focus has

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,520
this outline property as you can see here.

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:13,450
Now the outline is comparable to a border but it's not part of the box model,

15
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,830
keep in mind the border is part of the box model,

16
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:25,480
the outline actually is not. The outline is just some additional border-like thing which actually is

17
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,870
applied outside of the box,

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:36,490
so before the margin but after the border and it's therefore like a lighter version of the border. You can

19
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,480
style it with the outline property.

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,650
Now as you learned we need to use the focus pseudo selector for that and we can simply set outline to none

21
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:51,190
here because I don't want to have any look for when this button is focused.

22
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,280
Of course you can get a different style,

23
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:01,240
you can set outline to a different look or assign a normal border or change any other property. You can of

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,030
course do that for the focus pseudo selector

25
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,260
just as for any other pseudo selector. With that,

26
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,080
now if we reload and click that button, we don't have that blue outline and that is a look I like much

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,860
more.
