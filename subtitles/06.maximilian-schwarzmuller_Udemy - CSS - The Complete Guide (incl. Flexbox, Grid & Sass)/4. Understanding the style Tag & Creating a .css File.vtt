00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.330
So since we learned that inline styles are bad,

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.370
let's find a better alternative.

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.740
I remove the inline style and the first alternative I want to show you uses the head section, there

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.380
you can add a special style tag.

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.400
So it's a normal HTML tag with the name style and between the opening and closing selector, you can

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.800
now write so-called CSS rules.

7
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.400
Now a CSS rule in the end includes the same property value assignment we used on the section,

8
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.060
it just adds one extra thing because if you just write background

9
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.070
and then your color here like #ff1b68, of course CSS would have no chance of knowing what you

10
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.370
want to style with that color, you don't attach it directly to the element.

11
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.900
So what you need to add is a so-called selector. A selector simply is an additional piece of information

12
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.760
that tells CSS to which element in your DOM,

13
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.910
so inside of your body and the body is also treated as an element by the way, to which element you want

14
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.070
to assign this declaration,

15
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.910
so where you want to change the background in our case. You add a selector by simply typing the tag name

16
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.560
without the lower than and greater than signs,

17
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.340
so just section in our case,

18
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.690
then you add opening and closing curly braces to

19
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.890
now mark the part where you will set up the rules or the declarations for that given selector because

20
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.510
you can of course add multiple selectors for different elements on your page.

21
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.820
So in our case, I would grab that background code and put it inside of these curly braces

22
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.300
and now I'm telling CSS and CSS executes automatically,

23
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.800
it's run by the browser so to say, I tell it that it should look for all section elements on the page,

24
00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.550
we only have one but it would actually use all and apply this style to all found instances,

25
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.730
so to all sections on the page.

26
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.450
So if I now save this and I reload the page, we don't actually see a difference

27
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.470
which makes sense because we still style this element but now no longer via inline styles

28
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.400
but by directly adding a style in our template or in our head section, like this.

29
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.040
Now as I mentioned, this applies to all sections.

30
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.290
So if you add a second section and we'll need one in our project later, if you add a second section

31
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.760
here and let's say in this section we have another h1 tag where we say choose your plan because

32
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.600
later this will be the part where users can select their hosting plan,

33
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.440
if we do this and we save the file and we reload, you see both sections actually have that style.

34
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.300
You also see there is some whitespace between them and around them, I will come back to why that is the

35
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.300
case later

36
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.360
but now you can already see that selector doing work,

37
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.370
you write the rule once and you select all sections.

38
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.100
That's another advantage compared to inline styles where you would have to add this declaration to each

39
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.390
section separately

40
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.200
and if you ever changed the color, you would have to change it in all these section styles,

41
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.090
so that is the better way for many reasons.

42
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.640
Now there is one other way of including styles though and that is using an external stylesheet,

43
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.630
so let's do that now.

44
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.200
For that I'll add a new file to the project,

45
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.490
you can create it in your Windows Explorer or Apple Mac Finder of course or directly in your IDE as I

46
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.000
do

47
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.930
and in that new file, we will store the CSS code, hence the file should end with .css because it

48
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.700
contains CSS code.

49
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.860
The name is up to you,

50
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.570
I will name it main because it refers to the main page of our web application, of our web page but you

51
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.680
can pick any name you want.

52
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.280
Now in that file, you write your CSS rules.

53
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.330
Remember, a rule is this part which is composed of a selector, a property and a value.

54
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.210
So you grab that rule and then you put it into that CSS file

55
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.760
without the style tags, that's important,

56
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.160
we're not in a HTML file, so we don't need style tags. With that added, we can remove the style

57
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.010
tags from the index.html file

58
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.050
and now we can save both files,

59
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.510
so the change the index.html file and the new main.css file. If we then go back to the running page

60
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.570
and we reload it, 

61
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.310
you'll see the styles are gone

62
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.040
and do you have an idea why this is happening?

63
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.970
It of course happens because in our index.html file,

64
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.700
we never specify that we want to use or include this main.css file

65
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.850
and how would our browser know?

66
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.100
It doesn't automatically scan our file system and include every file it finds.

67
00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:00.940
So we have to explicitly tell it to use the main.css file and we do so by adding a link element,

68
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.950
so normal link element as we use it for the favicon with rel set to stylesheet, to inform it that we're including

69
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.340
a stylesheet here and then the hyper reference added with the href attribute should point to that

70
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.410
file. If that file would live in a subfolder,

71
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.880
then you would add subfolder/filename

72
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.270
but since it's in the same folder here, we just put the file name, so main.css. If we now save

73
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.030
that index.html file and we reload, the styles are back because now we're including the styles

74
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.920
through our file here

75
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.600
and with that, you learn the third way of including CSS. This actually is the recommended way because by

76
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.240
using an extra stylesheet, you can have a clear separation of your HTML and your CSS code which is

77
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.090
especially useful as your CSS code grows and it would bloat your head section at some point

78
00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:01.870
and additionally if you use the same stylesheet in multiple pages let's say, then your browser can cache

79
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.170
the stylesheet and doesn't need to re-download it for every new page, whereas if you include your styles

80
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.930
in the head section, you increase the file size of your HTML file and the browser needs to re-download it

81
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.820
since it's part of the HTML page for every new page which can be slower.

82
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.180
That is why in this course, we will use an external stylesheet

83
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.090
even if we only have one rule as in this case.
