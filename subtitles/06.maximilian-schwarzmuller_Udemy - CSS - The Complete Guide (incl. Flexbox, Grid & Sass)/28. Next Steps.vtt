00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.840
Now where should you go from this point on?

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.720
I can only recommend that you practice, practice and practice the grid.

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.470
In the last lecture of this module, you'll find useful links for the grid, like the Mozilla development

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.130
articles series on it and this is a great way for you to dive deeper, to read all about the grid,

5
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.800
so in case you want to dive deeper into some concept, this might be easier than watching all the videos

6
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.360
again,

7
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.020
so the videos combined with this article will especially be a great combination and there, you also find

8
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.750
plenty of examples with which you can easily play around

9
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.140
besides the examples in this course.

10
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.600
The best thing to master the grid however is to simply start building layouts and whatever you want to

11
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.500
build with the grid.

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.700
Set yourself challenges, rebuild certain layouts you see on other web pages,

13
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.460
try to position elements in a different way and dive into the documentation

14
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.170
if you're getting stuck. This is how you can learn it all,

15
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.390
the grid can look super intimidating because it has so many different properties and ways of achieving

16
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.730
certain looks,

17
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.240
the important thing for you is

18
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.610
there's more than one way to achieve a certain result and definitely play around with them to get

19
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.100
a feeling for which one works best for you,

20
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.640
there's not much you can do wrong here.

21
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.790
There are a lot of possibilities used to achieve one and the same thing

22
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.500
but this also means it's fine if you found one way that works for you.

23
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.700
So with that, I hope this was helpful and we'll move on with this course.
