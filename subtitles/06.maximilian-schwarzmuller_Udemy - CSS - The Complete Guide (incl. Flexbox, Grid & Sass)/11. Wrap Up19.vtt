00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.280
So that's it for this module.

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:11.330
You learned a lot about Javascript and how you can use it in conjunction with CSS. To be precise, you learned

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.240
how you may access style properties

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.850
via Javascript and change them via that style property.

5
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.490
You learned about the importance of using the camel case notation there,

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.630
so backgroundImage without a dash instead of with a dash or by using that alternative, wrap between

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.540
quotation marks as a string and by accessing the property via square brackets.

8
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:44.060
And you also learned how you can add or remove CSS classes, with class name or better if you don't want

9
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:52.790
to overwrite everything, via class list and the add and remove or toggle methods offered on that object,

10
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.370
it's easier and more flexible than class name.

11
00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.320
Now of course there is way more you can learn about Javascript but that is something you should do in

12
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.290
a Javascript focused or dedicated course.

13
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.430
We got all the tools we need for this project and tools which are in general useful for you as a developer

14
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.890
when you're working with CSS.
