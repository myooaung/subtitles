00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:09.230
So after fixing our customers page, let's now also limit the maximum width of our packages right here.

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.520
For that, we can simply go back to our customers page and copy this media query right here,

3
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.850
now go to the packages.css file and add the media query at the bottom of the code.

4
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.880
Don't forget to add the closing curly braces right here and now we don't need to select the testimonial

5
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.310
class of course but this time we need the main element right here because this is the wrapping element for

6
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.070
our packages right here.

7
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.980
So with that, we can change testimonial to main like that,

8
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.730
we can actually keep the margin of 3rem to the top and to the bottom,

9
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.420
I don't think this looks bad 

10
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.880
and the max width should also be the same that we had for the customers page.

11
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.690
If we now reload, we can see that we have a little bit of a gap up here now because of the margin we added,

12
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.760
the top and bottom margin but I think this looks nice and we can also see that once we hit the 1500

13
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.450
pixels,

14
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.310
so right here, the packages don't increase anymore or don't become any wider.

15
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.070
The problem though is

16
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.930
that we don't have all the borders right here because we actually didn't need these borders when we had this

17
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.990
design but once we see the entire package boxes, well there should be a border to the left to our plus

18
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.310
and premium plan and there should be a border to the right of our free plan.

19
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.070
Additionally, if we hover over our packages, like that,

20
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.150
the borders should also be complete and not be missing, like here to the right side of our free plan.

21
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.770
Now for that purpose, we need to add a second media query now.

22
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.230
Now we also have an application case for this option and this media query should become active once

23
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.190
we hit a width of 1500 pixels, so the maximum width that we defined right here.

24
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.200
So for that, let's copy the entire media query right here,

25
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.880
I think that's the fastest way

26
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.190
and now change 40rem to 1500 pixels.

27
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.170
Again, that's the max width right here.

28
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.370
So as soon as we reach this max width, we need to change certain properties.

29
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.680
Now which properties are that?

30
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:33.680
Well the first property we need to change is the border left none property right here, because this should

31
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.010
simply be changed to this one right here because that's the normal border we have.

32
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:48.500
So we will select the package class right here, so this will become .package and get rid of that second

33
00:02:48.500 --> 00:03:00.690
declaration and now simply add border left right, border left and now simply add this code right here.

34
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.160
With that if we go back and reload our page, you can see that the border to the left is now complete

35
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.020
for our plus plan right here

36
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.190
and if we decrease the size, we can see it's not visible and now it becomes visible,

37
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.330
that's really cool.

38
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.890
We also have to do this for the free plan. For that, we can find our free plan right here,

39
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:32.300
here it is, the border right none, so border right should also become this normal border design.

40
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.690
So let's select, now I forgot the ID selector to be honest,

41
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.430
this one here,

42
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:46.530
the #free right there, so let's add it like this and now this should be border right

43
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.270
that should be displayed.

44
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:55.970
Let's copy the same design we had before and if we now reload that page, we can see that we also have

45
00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.270
this right border now implemented which looks also a lot better as I would say.

46
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.700
So the last thing we need to fix is now this hover effect. Right here,

47
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.870
it's already implemented because we now added the border

48
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.970
and as we can see right here, we have our border left color defined,

49
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.570
so as soon as we have the border, well we can see this border color once we hover over it.

50
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.920
So the only thing we have to do right now is we have to add this code right here,

51
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.000
simply add it as our third rule maybe

52
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.990
and then did a little bit better like that and also like that

53
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.350
and now this should simply become border

54
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.870
right

55
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:43.170
color, like that. If we now also indent that a bit maybe, make sure we have a cleaner code, like this and like

56
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.700
that, now it looks better

57
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.170
and if we go back and reload, we can see that we now also fixed our packages page.

58
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.890
We can hover over all these packages,

59
00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.430
we have all the borders but once we go back below our 1500 pixel limit, we can see that the hover effect

60
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.700
is only visible for the free borders we can see

61
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.640
and we also don't see the left, the right and the left border right here.

62
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:18.720
With that, we also finished the packages page and I'm actually quite happy with the responsive design

63
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.390
but there are still two more things that I would like to fix to ensure that we have an as perfect as possible

64
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.680
status for our website and in the next lecture,

65
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:37.210
I will therefore have another look at the navigation bar because there is something not perfect yet.

66
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.500
Let's see what that is in the next lecture.
