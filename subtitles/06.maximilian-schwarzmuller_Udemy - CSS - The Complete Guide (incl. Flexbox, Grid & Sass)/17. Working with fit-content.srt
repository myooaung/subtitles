1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,850
So now we use the grid on our page,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,360
that's very useful

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,100
but one thing can be noticed on the main page.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,430
Now here above the image, we get this whitespace, so the image is now not positioned correctly anymore.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,310
Now the reason for this is simple,

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,930
if we inspect the main element and the rules of it, we see that we get a margin top there,

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,830
we should remove that to ensure that the image looks good again.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,820
So let's go back to our shared.css file,

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,450
let's remove that margin top here along with our min height calculation.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,400
We don't need it anymore because now we use the solution of reserving the place for the header with

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,460
an extra row.

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:45,180
So now if we reload, this change stays in place, on the other pages we didn't have a problem with that

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,950
anyways and now it's fixed on this page and all the other pages too.

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,770
Now if you go into mobile mode, you also might notice that the footer doesn't really sit at the very

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,630
bottom of this entire thing. In the layout tab,

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,710
you can still see that

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,770
we have a grid though and the grid row doesn't go to the very bottom, so that's issue we got here.

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,660
We can also see that our footer here is basically cut off.

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:20,100
Now the problem is the footer increases in size on a mobile device because we use flexbox to position

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,650
the elements in the footer below each other, like terms of use which are outside of the footer box here.

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,610
So we basically need to change our setup here for the grid

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,010
to something else than these fixed 8rems.

23
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,880
This should be something else which allows the footer to also grow, something like auto maybe.

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,870
However if we add auto, it still isn't perfect here as you can tell

25
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,000
and besides that if we set this to auto, we got a different layout on the other pages too

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,710
because if we got auto twice as we now have, these two will basically distribute empty space between

27
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,360
each other

28
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,220
and this is not the layout we want to have,

29
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,800
so auto isn't really the solution we're looking for here.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,920
Instead, there is a special function which I haven't shown you yet,

31
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:17,510
it's fit-content. fit-content takes an argument which is a default size

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,890
you can assign, like 8rem, which will be used in case the content is smaller or requires less place, less

33
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,310
space than that. If the content requires more space than that, it will get this size though

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,510
but only as much as needed by the content.

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,160
So if we set this and I now reload, now the footer is at the bottom. By the way in Firefox, you can still

36
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,730
scroll, as you can scroll to the right but this is actually just a bug,

37
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,990
it doesn't work like this if you open it on a mobile device or if you preview it in Chrome for example.

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,220
There, everything works as it should

39
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,570
and the same is true for all the other pages.

40
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,310
So now everything should look quite nice and should work the way

41
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:07,260
we expect it to work, the footer is at the bottom and takes as much space as required in case it's

42
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,450
not smaller than the 8rem which would be the default size of the footer otherwise.

43
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,360
So I hope this also helps with styling this and understanding how you can style it, fit-content is another

44
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,960
very useful value when it comes to having some row which should have some minimum size but

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,680
also not be bigger than its content.

46
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,310
This is what you're looking for.
