00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.980
So what have we achieved so far?

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.120
Before we dive into that, you might have noticed that the website and the dev tools are a bit smaller

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.750
when comparing it to the previous modules.

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.830
The reason for that is that I decreased the zoom level, I'm now at 100% zoom

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the reason for that is that now the pixels you see right here when we change the width in the developer

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.890
tools, the 1500 pixels right here for example are exactly equal to the pixels we

7
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.950
define in our code.

8
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.180
This will become important throughout this module as we will work a lot with this

9
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.600
changing the width thing right here,

10
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.960
therefore I hope you can still read all the core content on the website

11
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.040
but I think this is the better approach to really get the connection between the code and the actual

12
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.290
site width right here.

13
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.920
So with that, what have we achieved so far?

14
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.390
Well we have our starting page which looks nice on the desktop device.

15
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.510
The same thing is true for packages,

16
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.800
still not perfect yet

17
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.490
as you can see with the footer down here for example and the customers page, also nice, we see also a footer

18
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.720
problem but these are things we can definitely solve

19
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.910
but if we now go back to our starting page for example and decrease the width like that right here,

20
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.510
well then you can see that our site adjusts to this smaller width but we have a lot of issues,

21
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.000
for example the nav bar up here is kind of a mess,

22
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.180
then we can see that the different plans are also not really well organized.

23
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.840
We can see that the pricing right here is outside of the box,

24
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.030
the same thing is true for recommended

25
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.840
or also if we decrease it further, for the text right here and we can see that our svgs right here are also

26
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.300
not displayed correctly,

27
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.480
so basically our website is only partially responsive at the moment.

28
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.570
We have additional issues, for example this hamburger menu right here is visible all the time, although

29
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.490
we actually only need it on the mobile device.

30
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:17.400
So what we need, we need concepts and tools to make the site responsive and for that, we first have to understand

31
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.430
the difference between hardware or device pixels and software or CSS pixels.
