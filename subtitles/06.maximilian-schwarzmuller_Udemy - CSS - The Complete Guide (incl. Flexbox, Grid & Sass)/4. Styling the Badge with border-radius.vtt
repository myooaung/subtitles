00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.670
So we added a drop shadow in the last lecture,

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.240
now I want to work on that recommended badge. Keep in mind in the index.html file,

3
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:20.530
we added that plan annotation class to it. So we can use that and we can use it by simply using it with

4
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:26.520
the class selector here to assign a style and the style I want to add to that is

5
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.770
I want to make sure that this actually sits in a white box and therefore has non-white text and it also

6
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.150
should have a tiny drop shadow.

7
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.050
Now again this is a great practice for you, assign a white background, some green text, make sure that

8
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.280
maybe you have some padding to it, so just that it looks good and add a drop shadow,

9
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.740
you learned how to use it in the last lecture.

10
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.080
Here's your chance to pause the video,

11
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.350
come up with a style you like and then I will show you my approach,

12
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.960
my solution.

13
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.340
So were you successful? Let's try that together.

14
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.790
I'll first of all start with the background and I'll set it to white, to a solid white color

15
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.900
and of course you could also use a hex code or an rgb function here.

16
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.870
Then I'll assign a text color and there, I want to use that green color which we also used to highlight

17
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.820
our box, so it's the same green as we used as a background color for the highlighted box.

18
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:37.950
Then I will next also add my padding, maybe 8 pixels to all directions to have a little bit more

19
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.380
room, more space in that box.

20
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.500
Then let's also add a box-shadow and I will just copy the one from up there,

21
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.890
I like its look, let's add it like this, save it and reload

22
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.150
and that's our recommended badge here on our element,

23
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.680
looks nice in my opinion.

24
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.930
Now one thing I will do and which is of course totally optional,

25
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:12.080
I want to round the corners and that can be achieved with border-radius. Border radius is simply

26
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.600
used by either assigning a different value for each of its sites,

27
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.920
so just like margin you start at the top left, actually the top left corner, then top right corner, bottom

28
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.410
right and bottom left,

29
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.100
so it goes in the clockwise direction around the box

30
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.280
or if you want to use the same radius for all corners, you simply set one value

31
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.310
and here I will set all my corners to have a radius of 8 pixels.

32
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.280
I don't want to do that on the plan highlighted though

33
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.470
but on the plan annotation.

34
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:56.120
So with that if I now reload, we see we have this rounded corner here around the recommended badge.

35
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.210
Now this is looking nice in my opinion so I will leave it like this,

36
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.530
the next thing I want to work on are these bullet points.

37
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.780
So I want to have my features listed here but I don't want to have the bullet points. This is something

38
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.750
you can also try on your own,

39
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.140
try selecting this list and try working on these bullet points to ensure they look the way you want

40
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.850
them to look like.
