00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.030
Let's work on that action button you find at the bottom of each box.

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.550
Right now, it's a regular button with the default styles assigned to it by the browser,

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.400
I want to change that and for that, we could of course use the button selector but we might have multiple

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.780
buttons on the page and maybe we don't want to use the same style for all buttons necessarily.

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.760
So what I'll do is, I'll add a class but I'll just call that class button,

6
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.900
this allows me to still set up a generic button class or button style which I can easily attach to any button

7
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.770
I have

8
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.970
but if I ever have another button on the page which I want to have a different style, I just don't need

9
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:41.900
to attach it

10
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.690
and we don't have to worry about possibly getting into conflicts where we then need to overwrite properties

11
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.830
just because we want to go back to the defaults or anything like that.

12
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.980
So I'll grab that button class assignment and add it to all the three buttons

13
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.860
and now with that, we can go back to the stylesheet and work on the buttons.

14
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.190
I'll add the button styles at the bottom of our plan section

15
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.910
and as I said, I will set up a generic button style for the button class.

16
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.040
So let's use the button selector and let's start by adding a background color.

17
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.280
Here I want to use the dark green for all the buttons on the page,

18
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.430
I also want to give them a white text like this.

19
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.360
If we now save this and we go back and reload, we can see that

20
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.360
but we also see that the button has some strange differences.

21
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.420
Let's inspect it in the developer tools.

22
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.820
There we can see our 

23
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.590
button style is applied of course but if we scroll down, we see there are a couple of the default styles

24
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.810
set up, like a border which is by default added, some default padding

25
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.930
and if we go down a bit further, we also see that there are a lot of other defaults when it comes to

26
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.560
the text of the button.

27
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That's why the font here and the text in general doesn't really look like the text on the rest of our

28
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.850
page,

29
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.870
maybe that's the style you want but I don't want it here.

30
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.000
It does of course inherit the font family from our body but as you can see, this is actually overwritten

31
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.940
because inheritance is always overwritten by direct style assignments and the direct style assignment

32
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.650
we're getting is the font assigned here,

33
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.060
the font assigned by the browser.

34
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.560
So this is something I want to change

35
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.310
and for that, what we can do is we can add the font property and we could set the font family but then

36
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.810
we would keep the other overwritten font values,

37
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.260
so I will target the overall font property which is also just a shortened for setting a couple of text

38
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.020
properties in one step

39
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.700
and I will set it to inherit.

40
00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:05.100
Do you remember inherit? Inherit was a keyword, a value which forces the inherited styles to be applied.

41
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.370
So instead of using the browser defaults, it now will actually prioritize inheritance,

42
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.220
though technically that's not what happens,

43
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.310
it just looks at what it would have inherited and directly assigns these styles

44
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.600
so that we actually use the font family and the font defaults

45
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:31.420
we have on our page and we set up in our body. So with that if we save this and we now reload, you'll see the

46
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.450
button changed.

47
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.890
It increased in size because the text size was also overwritten by the browser defaults

48
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.390
and now it looks more like the rest of our content which I personally prefer.

49
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.140
Now I also want to get rid of that border,

50
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.040
so for that

51
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:53.680
button I'll also assign the border with the shortened property, set a 1 pixel or maybe a 1 pixel border

52
00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:02.440
here or 1.5 maybe, 1.5 pixels solid and then also of that dark green, so we could also set it to none since

53
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.270
you won't see it,

54
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.450
the background has the same color and I also want to overwrite the default padding and set it to 8 pixels

55
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.370
in all directions.

56
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.150
Now finally and that's of course up to you,

57
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.490
I want to add rounded corners, of course as always feel free to pause video and do it on your own,

58
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.760
we can use border radius for it and I will set it to 8 pixels too.

59
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.380
Now if we save that and we reload the page, now that button looks more like the way I want it to look.

60
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.580
One thing you'll notice though is that if you hover over it, you've got no indication that it's a button.

61
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.900
You don't get that hand cursor

62
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.320
and you also get no different hover style.

63
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.060
So these are further things I want to add.

64
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.400
I also want to change one thing about the text,

65
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.240
I want to set the font weight to bold

66
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:04.330
but now for that cursor. I want to set the cursor and you can set it with the cursor property to pointer,

67
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.090
the default is default.

68
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.650
That's the normal cursor icon but with pointer, you get that hand icon whenever your cursor is over

69
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.550
the button, is hovering over the button.

70
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:24.130
So now you see, the cursor changes here and the cursor property has more than default and pointer, you

71
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.290
can of course as for all the properties

72
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.310
always see this on MDN or in your IDE if it supports that autocompletion like mine does,

73
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:39.010
common values are default and pointer though. So with that, you can of course apply this to any element, not

74
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.740
just buttons or links, you can add it to any element, you can indicate to the user that something is clickable.

75
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.260
Now the hover effect was another thing that was missing,

76
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.750
so let's add a hover effect.

77
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.640
Do you remember how that works?

78
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.870
Yes,

79
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.410
you use the hover pseudo class

80
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.450
and let's also add the active pseudo class to change the style when we're holding the mouse pressed

81
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.100
down

82
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.790
and there I want to set the background color to white and now the text color to the dark green,

83
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.550
so I will reverse the styles. With that if we reload and hover over the button,

84
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.110
that looks much more clickable now.

85
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.270
Now one final thing I want to do,

86
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.430
the button doesn't do anything right now and

87
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:30.310
that will change over this course but I don't like this blue outline we have here.

88
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.390
So let's get rid of that in the next lecture

89
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.000
and let's also understand what an outline actually is.
