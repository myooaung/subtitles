00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.460
So what can be improved about this page?

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.950
There are a couple of things, for example here,

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.820
I'm using vendor prefixes.

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.260
Nothing wrong with that but I use them again a little bit further down, here.

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.200
It would be nice if we could outsource something like this, if we could put this into some reusable code

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.500
that we could just insert here and which then would be compiled to

7
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.780
the code we wrote here.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.130
Additionally, we got some nesting going on, here for the documentation links, we got a couple of nested

9
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.730
selectors and of course there's nothing wrong with this either but writing it like this is not as easy

10
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.070
to see as if we could write it at something like this, documentation

11
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.800
link inside here.

12
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.510
Now this is not supported in CSS but SASS will support it as you learned and this will of course be easier.

13
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.790
The color code, this is something else.

14
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.280
We use the same color code a couple of times on this page here as you can see and obviously, this also

15
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.290
is OK

16
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.250
but if we ever decide to change the color, we have to change it everywhere manually,

17
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.090
so it would be nice if we could reuse that too

18
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.430
and these are just some of the things. We will dive into some SASS features in this module and you will

19
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.960
see how we can shorten this code and make it easier to maintain.

20
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.160
Now with that, it's time to write our first SASS code and we'll do just that in the next lecture.
