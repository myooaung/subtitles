1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,860
Because if we comment that in again

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:12,960
and with that, have our good looking layout once again, we can see that this declaration right here, the

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,570
values follow a certain pattern

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:23,090
obviously because the first value right here, this one, is the font family that we want to address.

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,390
Please note the capital letter right here and the quotation marks, the quotation marks are actually not

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,530
necessary all the time right here,

7
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,340
you have to add them though if your font family consists of multiple separate names

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,370
and so therefore, you have whitespaces, then it's required, right here

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,810
we could also delete those, like that

10
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,380
and if we now reload the page, we can see that it would still work.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,680
Nevertheless, you can add them all the time,

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,220
it's not a problem actually

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,320
and after this font family, we have this sans-serif right here and as we learned, sans-serif is a generic

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,440
family and this already shows you the general pattern how you should write this declaration.

15
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,860
You first start with the most specific thing you have and the most specific thing you have is basically

16
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,580
your font family.

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,350
This could by the way not only be one family, this could also be two or more families,

18
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,120
for example we could use Verdana right here,

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,020
let's also add the quotation marks, like

20
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,690
that and then add sans-serif at the end. What will simply happen then is your browser will look for Monserrat,

21
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,230
in case you can't find it, you will apply the

22
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,860
Monserrat font family.

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,120
If they can't find it,

24
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,650
he will jump to the next font family, Verdana.

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,830
If it cannot find this one, he will jump through the next one and so on and so on

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,630
and in the end, he will simply fallback to this

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,380
fallback,

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,280
the generic family and then simply apply

29
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,690
a font family out of the generic family

30
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,390
you defined. Now what I simply mean by that is if we would fallback to sans-serif, the browser would select Helvetica

31
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,750
in our case because we specified in the browser settings that if the generic family that should be displayed

32
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,590
based on their code is sans-serif, then use the Helvetica font family please.

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,460
Let's maybe try that out quickly and enter a value as like unknown, right here,

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,740
so the unknown font,

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,800
I don't think this one is existing.

36
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:31,600
So if we now try this out and maybe not use for Verdana as our second font family because this is our

37
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,320
standard font right here,

38
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,550
so let's maybe use another font,

39
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,730
let's see which one looks different, this one right here, 

40
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,100
yes,

41
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,480
Zapfino,

42
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,930
this

43
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,880
one right here,

44
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,420
this is a font family we will recognize.

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:52,360
So let's go back to our code and add this one right here, so Zapfino, like that and if we

46
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,430
now go back to our website right here and reload it,

47
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,890
then you can see that this relatively ugly Zapfino style was applied.

48
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,280
Why is this happening now?

49
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,750
Well because the unknown font family, so our first family right here could not be found of course,

50
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:17,290
therefore the browser goes to the next one, the font family Zapfino, which was available in case of the

51
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,220
Chrome browser, so

52
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,510
in my case and therefore, this font family will be applied.

53
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,550
If we would change that name right here to

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,400
maybe also unknown, like that

55
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:36,510
and then reload the page, we can see that the font style changed again because now, we fell back to our

56
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:43,350
sans-serif generic family right here and the sans-serif family that we have is this one, Helvetica.

57
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,770
If I would change that now again to maybe Zapfino, what we just had, then you would see that the website

58
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:56,190
changed according to that because the fallback simply says Please choose the sans-serif generic family

59
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,990
and then select the font family that we defined in the browser right here.

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,250
This was Helvetica I think, so let's add it back, like that,

61
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:13,620
if we go back, Helvetica is back here and that's actually the core idea of the syntax of this font family

62
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,230
property. You would define the property of course,

63
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,160
then you define the first font family you would like to have,

64
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,540
then the second one, as many as you would prefer actually

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,620
but in the end, you'll specify a generic family because with that, you always make sure that the text

66
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,470
on the website can be displayed and the text that should be displayed should at least be part of

67
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,770
a generic family of your choice.

68
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:44,520
However, we will change back one family to our default value and this was Monserrat right here, this

69
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,480
one because with that, our website looks the way it did before again. And for the next lectures, we will

70
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:57,360
not use the entire website to play around with the font families but we will focus on the packages.css

71
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,320
file and package info class.

72
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,790
As I said before, this basically refers then to this part right here

73
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,500
and with that, we can see the difference as to our default font that we applied and to the new font we want

74
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,680
to apply in an easier way.

75
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,840
So with that, if we think back about the slide, we understood this default behavior with the standard

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,030
font that will be defined or selected by the browser

77
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,250
if we don't add the font family property.

78
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,040
We also had a look at the generic family that we defined and with that, we allowed the browser to select

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,770
the font family that was selected in the browser,

80
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:41,010
this was our fallback basically and we had a first look at the definition of a font family in CSS.

81
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,140
What we didn't have a look so far at until this point is the difference between having the font family

82
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,040
saved on the user's computer

83
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,810
as a web font or retrieved from a server.

84
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,610
So in the next lecture, we'll have a look at this and dive in the different approaches,

85
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:06,240
the advantages and disadvantages and we will start in the next lecture with the fonts that are normally

86
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,920
installed on every user's computer,

87
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,880
we will see what ever user's computer actually is, how we can use them and what the limitations are that

88
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,480
we have

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,470
using this approach.
