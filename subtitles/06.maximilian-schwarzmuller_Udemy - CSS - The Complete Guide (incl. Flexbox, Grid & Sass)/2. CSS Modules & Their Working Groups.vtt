00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.780
As mentioned at the very beginning of the course, CSS is split up into modules.

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:16.070
You got a module on media queries, you got a module on selectors, you got a module on animations and so

3
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.960
on.

4
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.940
Now at the end of this module in this course here, you'll find a link to this page which gives you an

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.680
overview over the different working groups that work on new CSS features, sorted by these modules

6
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.970
basically.

7
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:39.560
Now on this page, you see which groups exist and also what the current state of the results of that group

8
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.030
is,

9
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.560
for example if it's a recommendation, which means browsers should implement that and they regularly do

10
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:53.270
that or if it's just a draft which browsers may implement but which they don't have to yet or which

11
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.000
is not necessarily recommended to them yet.

12
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.090
So you can scroll through that list and find out which groups exist and you can always click into one

13
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.880
of these groups, like CSS transitions and read more about their work, what it's all about, what they

14
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.650
plan, which syntax they'd like to see and so on.

15
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.320
This can be really interesting but this also is something you don't regularly do, unless you work for

16
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.040
a browser vendor.

17
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.130
This is a nice place to dive deeper if you really want to go super deep into a specific feature

18
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.420
but generally, this is just what the browsers have to implement in the end and what MDN, the Mozilla

19
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.500
Developer Network which we referenced quite a bit in this course, typically summarizes and makes more

20
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.670
digestible.

21
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.530
Still, this is the original work or these are the summaries, the protocols of the original work groups

22
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.040
and this can be a nice place to dive deeper in case you're interested.
