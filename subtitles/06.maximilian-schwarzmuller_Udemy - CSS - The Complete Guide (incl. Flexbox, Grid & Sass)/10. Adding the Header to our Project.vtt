00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.610
So with all that theory out the way, it's time to continue working on our course project and make sure

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.950
we take the next major step when it comes to that

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.140
and for that, I'll first of all get rid of that ugly border, get rid of that margin

4
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.670
we don't need and yes I'll leave the padding for now I guess.

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.000
So if we save this and we reload, this is what we end up with,

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.230
looks a bit nicer.

7
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:32.120
Now I want to add a navigation bar too and for that, I attached a file where you find some HTML code which

8
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.980
we'll now add to our index.html file. There above the main section,

9
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.390
we'll paste in the code you'll find in that attached file which is a header element with some div inside

10
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.510
of it with a nav element which then in turn has an unordered list with list items that should become

11
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.890
our application

12
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.520
navigation. This is some typical markup which you might see in this form or slight variations in your

13
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.980
web pages.

14
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.900
Here are some links, they all won't work for now but we'll add these pages throughout the course and

15
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.540
if we save that and also save the updated main.css file of course and reload it,

16
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.120
we got this ugly part at the top.

17
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.850
Now our goal for the next lectures will be to turn this into a non-ugly part,

18
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:28.490
so we'll add our header and we can start by simply selecting the header element itself.

19
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.400
Now of course what we can do is, we can now simply add header like this,

20
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.900
we can target the header element by the element selector.

21
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.600
The downside of this is that we might use multiple headers in a web page,

22
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.970
it's not limited to the navigation, the header element actually can also be used within a section for

23
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.940
example.

24
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.220
So therefore using header here is not really the best way, would be better to define our own class,

25
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.300
so I'll add main-header, that the class name is totally up to you but it should be descriptive

26
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.590
and here I named main header because I believe this clearly indicates this is the main header of our page,

27
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.030
not some section header or anything like that.

28
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.020
Now this class of course needs to be attached to the header element then,

29
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.110
so let's go to the HTML code and add the main header class.

30
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.220
So now the main header is defined such that we can start using or can start styling it. Now which

31
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.800
styles can we attach here? Of course any styles you want but I want to create a header which spans the

32
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.560
full width, which has a green background color

33
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.070
as this will be kind of the main theme color our application will use,

34
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.580
of course you are always free to choose a different one

35
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.010
and I also want to give it some padding, so that the text in the header or the content of the header

36
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.830
doesn't directly sit on its edges.

37
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.980
Now that is a good practice for you,

38
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:07.770
the goal is to add a background color, to add some padding and set the width to the full page width.

39
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.800
These are all things we already practiced,

40
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.280
so here's your chance to pause the video and then do this on your own and after you unpause, we'll do

41
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.160
it together.

42
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.750
Were are successful? Let's do it together. To set the width to 100%,

43
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.290
we simply add width 100% and this is kind of optional because it's a block level element,

44
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.470
it takes the full entire width anyways but it's still something we can set up, especially as we later

45
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.970
in the course will revisit this and style this differently where this will actually become important.

46
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.080
Now besides that, we want to set a background color. Now I mention I want to use green and maybe you just

47
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.750
use green which is fine but I prepared a special hex code,

48
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.450
a nice green

49
00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:03.300
I personally like and it's #2ddff5c, of course you are free to choose any green you want,

50
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.000
it's the same green we used for the section title though.

51
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.730
Finally, some padding.

52
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.630
Now here, I'll add a padding to top and bottom and left and right

53
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.770
but I want to use different values,

54
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.100
I want to use the same padding for the top and the bottom and the same padding for the left and the

55
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.130
right but not the same padding for top, bottom, left and right.

56
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.750
So what we can do is we can use this to value shorthand

57
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:35.090
I showed you in an earlier slide and I'll set the padding top and bottom to 8 pixels and to left and right

58
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:44.630
to 16 pixels, like this. If we now save this and we reload the page, we got that green header, we also see

59
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.250
that our text doesn't directly touch the edges anymore, from a styling perspective,

60
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.360
we can still improve this a bit in my opinion though,

61
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.530
for example this unordered list doesn't look that great

62
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.530
and by the way, if you don't like that color edge here, we'll also replace the red color with an image later

63
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.180
on.

64
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.830
So let's continue with the header though,

65
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.010
we made a great first step but the list items positioned like this,

66
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.020
that's not really helpful.

67
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.240
We don't want to have a list rendered like that,

68
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.660
we just want to use a list semantically but from a styling perspective, all these list items should sit

69
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.120
next to each other, not on top of each other.

70
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.490
Now to achieve this, we'll actually need to dive into a new property, the display property.

71
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.700
Let's explore it in the next lecture.
