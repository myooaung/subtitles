00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:09.440
So we understood that we have different ways to add different font families or generic families to our

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.240
website.

3
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.600
Now let's have a look at the current situation on our website now and then play around with this font

4
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.990
family property.

5
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.190
For that, I'm on the packages page and I would like to have a look at a specific part of this page, at

6
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.170
this part

7
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.910
right here, our package info class.

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.430
Why do I want to choose that?

9
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.650
Well because inside this package info class, we basically have just some text and the text is something

10
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.270
we need if we want to play around with font families.

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.780
Now as you can see, I selected this class right here

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.120
and if I now pull this up a bit, we can see that we have a specific font size applied,

13
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.650
we know the font size property already,

14
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.880
nevertheless we'll also have a look at that again

15
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.750
but the important thing we have to keep in mind now is that the font family,

16
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.710
this one right here is now inherited from our body because at the beginning of this course, we imported

17
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.440
the font family from Google fonts.

18
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.080
So basically, we use a so-called web font right now.

19
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.070
We will also keep this web font for the entire website

20
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.320
but I would like to change this default font family right here for our package info class.

21
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.840
Therefore, let's have a look at the import of the web font again to see what we did so far

22
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.440
and let's then change the font family for our info class, for our package info class right here.

23
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.300
In our project, if we go to the index.html file, so the main index.html file, you can see that

24
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.310
these are the links to the Google web fonts that Max added throughout this course. We will keep these links,

25
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.730
I will not delete them because Google still uses web fonts but the important thing is that this is

26
00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.600
the import we have to make sure that the fonts are available to all our users.

27
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.270
In the shared.css file then, right here,

28
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.640
we can see that we have our body selector and we said that the font family should be Monserrat or

29
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.900
sans-serif, I'll dive into the syntax in a few seconds.

30
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.230
So this is Monserrat, right here and if we go back to our index.html file, we can see that this was imported

31
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.540
right here.

32
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.710
Now with that, we made sure that our entire website basically uses this font family and if you think

33
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.260
back about our slides, I said that the first way to display fonts is the default way,

34
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.780
so basically let the browser decide what font family it should display.

35
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.850
Now what happens if I comment this font family out, right here,

36
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.470
like this and like that and now go back to our website?

37
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.750
Keep in mind, at the moment we used the Monserrat font family right here and if we now reload the

38
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.300
page, we can see some interesting things.

39
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.850
The first thing we see is that our nav bar kind of crashed.

40
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.130
What's the reason for that?

41
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.770
Well the font family that now is supplied by default,

42
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.860
we will in a few seconds find out which one this is, simply needs more space, more width than the family

43
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.770
we had before, our web font.

44
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.350
This means if we go back to the shared.css file and scroll down to our, as I would call it, dirty

45
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.710
fix, this one right here and increase the width right here

46
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.090
in our calculation to 70 for example and would reload the page,

47
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.880
you can see that the nav bar would work again.

48
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.620
Still,

49
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.520
this is our dirty fix for the moment, so we will keep it to 44 for now because the nav bar is not our actual

50
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.370
focus.

51
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.880
I just wanted to show you that we could fix that easily but it's not the purpose of this module now.

52
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.730
As we are talking about the nav bar already and you probably fix this in the meanwhile

53
00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.720
but if we go to the customers page and then click onto start hosting, then you had this error before.

54
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.150
As I said, you probably fixed it already,

55
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.460
in case you didn't, just go to the index.html file in the customers folder and if you now scroll down a bit,

56
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.080
you can see the reason for this error right here.

57
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.730
We have to move one level up right here,

58
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.200
so for the third list item right here,

59
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.800
so you have to add dot dot and a slash

60
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.040
and if we now go back to our page, jump back and now click start hosting, you can see that this link

61
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.190
is working fine now.

62
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.770
Now back to packages,

63
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.180
I just wanted to make sure that we have the same status in our project now

64
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.040
and we can also close this index.html

65
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.580
file. Again, scroll up again to our body selector in the shared.css file.

66
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.600
That was a lot of jumping around now,

67
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.490
I hope you're still with me because now we can go back to our actual problem. And the actual problem

68
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.460
is not a real problem because we actually simply commented out the font family,

69
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.410
this one right here,

70
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.990
so at the moment we don't have any font family applied in our code and still we saw that the font changed.

71
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.860
Let me maybe comment this out quickly for you so that we can see what happened, let's do this one, like that. Here

72
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.730
we had our font that we imported

73
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.190
and if we now comment this out again, we are back with the new font. As you can see, the font family changed

74
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.790
obviously. If we look into our styles, we cannot find the font family anymore,

75
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.400
right here there is no font family but if we go to our computed tab and then scroll down a bit, right

76
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:42.210
here to our font family, this one, you can see that Verdana is now applied.

77
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.100
And if you remember when we had a look at the browser settings,

78
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.220
Verdana was somewhere there.

79
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.080
Let's have a look and go back to the settings, right here

80
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.490
and indeed, our standard font is now Verdana.

81
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:03.020
This means if I change this to Times New Roman for example and go back to our website, you can see

82
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.360
that the font family now changed to Times New Roman but I think this is really ugly,

83
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.390
so let's switch it back to Verdana maybe, like that.

84
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:21.070
So as you can see, if we don't add the font family property to our code on the website, then the default

85
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:28.060
browser setting is the one that defines the font family that you selected there and the disadvantage of

86
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.940
this approach is of course that as I said in the beginning on the slide, the font family then totally

87
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.800
depends on the user settings

88
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:43.300
and with that, you have no control at all of the font family that will be displayed on your website.

89
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.310
So not adding a font family,

90
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.550
probably not what we're going to do.

91
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.760
So let's go back to the code and let's see what else we can change right here.
