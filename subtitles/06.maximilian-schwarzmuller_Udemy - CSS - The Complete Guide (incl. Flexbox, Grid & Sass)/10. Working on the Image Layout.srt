1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:07,090
So in the last video, we added our customers page, now attached to this video you'll find some starting CSS

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,140
code which you please enter into your customers.css

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,470
file,

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,020
this code styles everything but the images,

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,350
so what happens here in the end is just setting some margins, paddings and some inline block display 

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:20,870
styles,

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,200
that's all.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,140
If we save that and with it, we go back to our page,

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,040
well we don't see that many changes, the text change, that's cool,

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,800
the images still look the way they did before though but

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,810
for a good reason, because we haven't changed their style,

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,880
we'll do that together.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:45,760
So let's start working on these images then, what can we do with them? If we go back to our HTML code in

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,230
the customers folder, we see for the images, we already got a surrounding container, the testimonial image

15
00:00:53,230 --> 00:01:00,200
container and the image itself also has a class of testimonial image, both images have that set up.

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,460
With that, we can go to our CSS file and let's maybe start with the container. 

17
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,430
So in the customers.css file,

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:17,170
I will add the testimonial image container below my testimonial first of type selector which is a pseudo

19
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:23,650
selector to ensure that the first testimonial has a margin top and the second one hasn't because I don't

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,980
want to have that much distance between the two testimonials, only towards the top

21
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:36,250
and with that testimonial image container class added here, we can of course start assigning styles

22
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,090
to it.

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,080
Let's also already grab the testimonial image class though because we will have a hard time setting

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,130
heights and widths without also changing the image itself,

25
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,430
so we should definitely add testimonial image here

26
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,700
and let's now start assigning heights and widths.

27
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:03,340
So for the image container, let's start with a width of 80% because if we have a look at our HTML

28
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:10,000
code, the image container is setting next to the info and the info actually should not take up that

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,540
much space.

30
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:18,940
So if we set this width to 80% and for the image itself, we set it to 100%,

31
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,660
we wouldn't see any effect unless we also set the container, the image container to display inline

32
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,030
block

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,040
as you learned over the last lectures, then the image will respect the width of the parent. So with the

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,030
width and display inline block

35
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,150
added to the container and the width added to the image,

36
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,110
let's reload the page now

37
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,740
and we indeed decreased the size of our images, so that's much better.

38
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,350
Still, they don't fit into one line with our other text.

39
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,970
Now if we inspect that however, so the testimonial info class that is,

40
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,840
we see that it also does have the inline block display style.

41
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:05,780
So theoretically, we could fit it into one line with our other image container, for that however, we have

42
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:15,440
to go to testimonial info and limit its width. So if I set a width of 20%, then we would run into

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,620
that issue with inline block if this adds up to 100,

44
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,440
so let's maybe set the image container to 70.

45
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,180
If we now reload, now the text is next to the image, 

46
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,100
it's not aligned in the middle but it's next to it.

47
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,920
Now why does it have that strange positioning though?

48
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:38,960
The reason for this simply is that our info container has vertical align middle, our image container

49
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,410
which is its adjacent inline block element doesn't have it, so it's not positioned correctly

50
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,330
if we assign vertical align middle to the image container too and we reload,

51
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,010
now the text actually is positioned next to our testimonial image.

52
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,040
Now maybe we want to play with the sizes again,

53
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,950
increase the size of the info to let's say 30% and decrease the image container to 65.

54
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,280
With that if we reload,

55
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,950
that looks a bit nicer.

56
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,850
So now we already got quite a nice style,

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,090
we can do more with that though

58
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:17,840
and by the way also notice that of course right now, our page is only partly responsive, for small screens

59
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:24,050
this looks really awkward and for big screens, we got huge images but this is something we can control

60
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,680
once we reach the responsive design lectures.

61
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,470
So with that, we got a nice look on this layout however,

62
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,830
so what else can we do here?

63
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,630
Well how about a shadow behind these images?

64
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:45,230
We can go to our image container now because we want to add that shadow to the block level element and

65
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:55,780
add box shadow and then maybe 3 pixels, 3 pixels, 3 pixels and then rgba 0, 0, 0.3 for a

66
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,490
light grey-ish transparent shadow. If we

67
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,230
now reload, our image does have that nice shadow which looks all right.

68
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,150
Now we also got that annoying whitespace at the bottom of the image though,

69
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,950
this is simply an inline element bug,

70
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,510
we can get rid of it by going to our testimonial image and setting vertical align on the image,

71
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,760
not on the container but on the image to top or bottom, it actually will both work.

72
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,540
Now with that, it gets rid of that whitespace, so that's a nice trick to keep in mind.

73
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:33,520
If you've got an image in a surrounding container and the image of course is an inline element, you can

74
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,520
get rid of that whitespace that is introduced to that inline element behavior by adding vertical

75
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,830
align top,

76
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,720
an alternative would be to set the image to display block.

77
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:51,790
This would also fix it, it would turn it to a block level element and hence remove any whitespace after

78
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,210
it.

79
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,930
Both works, I'll use the vertical align top solution.

80
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,970
Now with that, this looks quite nice in my opinion,

81
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,600
got a nice page here,

82
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,710
now one thing I notice is my footer doesn't work correctly.

83
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:12,140
Let's quickly check this, main footer is the class but the main footer links class is missing,

84
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,410
so let's quickly copy that from our other footer,

85
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,330
sorry about that.

86
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:23,420
So let's quickly add the main footer links class to the unordered list and the main footer link class to

87
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,370
the list items.

88
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,990
If we save that and reload,

89
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,120
this looks better

90
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,600
and now we got a nice customers page here.

91
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,250
So this really looks all right,

92
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:40,350
we got a nicely styled customers page with images, that looks better, however

93
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,900
what about that second image, can't

94
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,890
we improve the box shadow of that?

95
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:50,570
It does have it, you can see it below the image but wouldn't it be nice to have a little bit more box

96
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,870
shadow on the left and right here too?

97
00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:00,710
We can actually add this by going back to the customers.css file and adding a fourth value to the box

98
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,670
shadow, the spread.

99
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,990
We can set this to 3 pixels too and if we now reload, you'll see there's a tiny shadow to the left

100
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:18,560
and top too because spread simply defines how much the box shadow leaves its border, so how much it adds

101
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,510
to the left, right and top and bottom. So it spreads out a little bit,

102
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,060
improving the look of this image in my opinion.

103
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,200
Maybe we need more blur now,

104
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,190
yes this looks better.

105
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:38,020
So this is the final state with which I want to end, this is how you add and style images.

106
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,960
Now keep in mind,

107
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,550
background images actually give you more flexibility,

108
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:48,920
you can position them easier, you can do more with them but you should only use them for backgrounds

109
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,710
because of accessibility

110
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:57,590
but as you saw in this video, styling images like this also is perfectly possible and can lead to nice

111
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,800
looking pages.

112
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:05,140
Again, the responsive part is something we'll extensively cover in the responsive layout section.
