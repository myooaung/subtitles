00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.480
Now that we know with the sessions we can still a variable that lasts as long as the user has a website

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.180
open in their browser.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.240
This is pretty good but sometimes we might want to keep them logged in for longer.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.820
And for that we would use cookies now cookies have got themselves a bit of a bad reputation mostly because

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.620
they're often used to track users as they go around the web.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.860
But we'll be using them for a completely legitimate purpose of keeping our users logged into our website

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.110
after they've closed the browser.

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.480
So let's see how we use cookies in HP.

9
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.440
I'm going to go back to our indexed APHC and get rid of all of this.

10
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.700
As we won't be using it again.

11
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.800
So with cookies.

12
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.030
They work quite differently to sessions.

13
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.730
We don't need to start a cookie session or anything like that.

14
00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:04.430
We just use the set cookie function to create a cookie and then we give the cookie a variable name.

15
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.970
So that might be something like customer ID and then we give it a valley.

16
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.940
So that might be one two three four.

17
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.590
And then the difference between a session variable is that with a cookie we need to give an expiry date.

18
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.690
So that can be any time in the future.

19
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.680
And the usual way to do this is to use the time command to get the current time on the server.

20
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.870
And that will return a big number in seconds and then we just add to that the number of seconds that

21
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.230
we wanted to last.

22
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:50.580
So if we want our cookie to last 24 hours for example then we take 60 seconds multiplied by 60.

23
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.250
So that gives us the number of seconds and an hour and then 24 hours.

24
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.400
So that cookie would expire in a day's time.

25
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.080
If you want to keep it there for five days we'd multiply that by five if you wanted to keep it there

26
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.180
for a year.

27
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.030
Then we multiply by 365.

28
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.280
So let's keep our cookie down to a day for now.

29
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.310
And once we set our cookie we can access it in the usual way.

30
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.370
So it would do something like

31
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:32.450
cookie to get the cookie array and then customer id say let's have a look

32
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:44.000
and they were gay so you can see we've got the cookie value and of course if we comment out the cookie

33
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.490
we can still use it there.

34
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:57.830
And if I shut down that browser tab completely open up a new one and find my page the cookie value will

35
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.260
still be there.

36
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.510
And that's pretty much all there is to it except I do want to show you how to remove a cookie when necessary.

37
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.370
So if the user logs out of your website you're going to want to delete that cookie permanently.

38
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.810
And there's a slightly counter-intuitive way of doing that.

39
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.830
And what you do is you set cookie again with the same name.

40
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.070
And it really doesn't matter what value you put here.

41
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:33.800
But for reasons that I'll explain in a minute it's best to put an empty string for the value and then

42
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.660
you just put the time in the past

43
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.120
so it can be anytime in the past.

44
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.820
But I normally use an hour in the past just to be sure and that's it.

45
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:55.010
So that will essentially unset the cookie but it will only unset it on the next load of the page.

46
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.710
So be aware of that.

47
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.710
You can see it's still displayed the cookie even though we've officially got rid of it there.

48
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.690
But if we run that script again then you can say it doesn't exist.

49
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.790
That Customer ID is undefined.

50
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.360
So bear in mind that when you remove a cookie like that it doesn't remove until the next page load and

51
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.660
you will have noticed as well that it still gave the value of 1 2 3 4.

52
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.640
Not an empty value.

53
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.310
So this empty string just reminds us that we're not actually updating the value of the cookie.

54
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.130
We're not actually changing it at all.

55
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.770
We're just changing the time that it expires.

56
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.260
So if you want to update the value of the cookie then you would just use it in the normal way.

57
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:49.390
So let's change it to test and let's create our cookie in the future.

58
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.150
And if we now do that you can see that we've updated the value there.

59
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.000
So to update the value of the cookie you just do that in the way that you would get or post or any array

60
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.420
variable and that will update immediately.

61
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.570
But if you want to get rid of it then you set it in the past.

62
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.990
But bear in mind it'll take two refreshes of the page for it to disappear.

63
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.250
So that's how to work with cookies.

64
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.120
We've now just got one more video to go before we begin our big page and my askew l project the secret

65
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.400
diary web app.

66
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.540
And in this last video I'll show you how to store your user's passwords securely.
