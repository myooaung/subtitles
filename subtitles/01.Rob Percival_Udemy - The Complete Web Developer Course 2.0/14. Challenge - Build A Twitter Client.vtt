00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.640
So now that you've learned how to connect to and work with the Twitter API this challenge is going to

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.230
be an opportunity to put that into practice.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.080
It's not a particularly complicated one but it will require you to work through the Twitter documentation

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.780
for its API and to process the results that come out of it.

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.360
Like with the previous challenge I'm not going to show you my output in advance so you have to figure

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.910
out how you're going to make a Twitter client look essentially the project that we're going to try to

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.260
create is pretty simple.

8
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:36.360
I want a twitter client that displays the tweets on my timeline but I only want to see the ones that

9
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.230
have been favorite it at least twice.

10
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.940
My aim for this of course is to filter out lots of tweets that I might not be interested in and just

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.840
say the most popular ones.

12
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.330
So that's the challenge.

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:56.230
Just before I set you off to do that might be worth having a quick google of Twitter API endpoints.

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.450
So an end point is essentially you Arel where you can access Twitter like

15
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.800
status update status is home timeline etc. and once youve done that Google will take you to this page

16
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.950
and you can see we've got all the different you are else here to do all sorts of different things to

17
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.900
do with the Twitter system so that page you'll probably need.

18
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.850
The other thing you'll probably want to do if you've just created a Twitter account is to follow a bunch

19
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.800
of people.

20
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.200
So I'm just going to follow whoever is suggested here.

21
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.490
You'll get a different set of suggestions of course but that should give me a bit of a time line to

22
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.240
work with.

23
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.810
Without that then there won't be much to choose between.

24
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.620
All right.

25
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.310
So that's the challenge of ego.

26
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.290
And best of luck.

27
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.940
All right.

28
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.580
Well the first thing that we're going to need is to see how to get the users timeline that is the set

29
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.110
of tweets that will appear on the user's home page.

30
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.410
So if we have a look down at the various options within the Twitter API.

31
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:26.020
So if we look back to our code you can see that the API endpoint we used to get the user's tweets with

32
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.330
status slash underscore timeline.

33
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.410
So let's have a quick look.

34
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.390
About one and see what it does.

35
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.090
So home timeline returns a collection of the most recent tweets and retreats posted by the authenticated

36
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.840
user and the users that they follow.

37
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.920
So that's actually what we need to get the tweets themselves.

38
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.200
So if we now have a look at that because we've followed a bunch of people we should have a lot more

39
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.660
status on there than we had before.

40
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.180
So I'm just going to get rid of the instruction to post because we don't want to post that every time

41
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.760
we run our script.

42
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.500
And yep definitely looks like we've got a lot more information than we had before.

43
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.370
So let's have a look.

44
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.970
Wonderful.

45
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.590
Yep so we're definitely getting some tweets from various people there.

46
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.120
Bodleian libraries etc..

47
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.790
Wonderful.

48
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.590
And you can see we've got this very important variable favorite account.

49
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.020
So that's obviously what we're going to be using to tell whether or not a tweet is important enough

50
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.140
for us to feature it in our client.

51
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.570
So let's just tidy things up a little bit and then we'll start processing this.

52
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.400
So first off we're going to want to loop through the array that we've got here so you can see we've

53
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.660
got this zero.

54
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.270
And then all the information for that particular tweet.

55
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:59.210
And then after all of that we've got a 1 and then the next tweet and then at c et cetera.

56
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.510
So we want to loop 3 array.

57
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.560
So let's do that.

58
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.400
First off we'll do that with a for each

59
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.640
status is as we don't actually need the number.

60
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.190
So I'm just going to the status is as

61
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.060
and then for now we'll just print the tweets.

62
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.200
And so that should give us something pretty similar but it won't have the array at the top because we're

63
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.960
just printing the content.

64
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.430
All right.

65
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:49.300
So let's try and get the text of each tweet for the moment now you might guess that to get the text

66
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.460
you would do something like

67
00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.380
text like that because that's how we normally access an array.

68
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.000
Aha.

69
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.370
But something's gone wrong here.

70
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:12.800
This is a type SDD class and we're trying to access it like an array.

71
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.250
So we need to use a different formatting because this isn't quite an array.

72
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.430
It's actually an object which works slightly differently.

73
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.050
But never fear.

74
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.710
Let's do a quick google and figure out how we would do it.

75
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:38.650
So access elements in standard class object BHP was what I was after that they were going to access

76
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.340
standard class object after a specific key value pair.

77
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.720
Let's have a look.

78
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.840
Ha.

79
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:57.590
So to access that data we actually use an arrow or a dash and a greater than sign and then the name

80
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.680
of the variable that we want.

81
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.440
So again that's because these are different sorts of variables to arrays.

82
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.370
So we have to use a different syntax to extract the data that we want.

83
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.670
So let's give that a try.

84
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:25.310
We want to get the text and then I'll just put in a line break as well as one after the other.

85
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:32.750
And I'm also going to open that and I knew tab so that we keep the open open as well.

86
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.930
And there we get.

87
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.140
So we don't actually need to view source because I put a B R in there.

88
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:47.320
So now we've got the text of each of those tweets and you can see we've got my two there as well.

89
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.910
And then a bunch of other ones.

90
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.040
All right.

91
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:57.120
So now is the time to work out how many favorites each one has and then only display the ones that have

92
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.560
two or more.

93
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:05.880
And if we scroll down you can see we've got a favorite count here but that's actually the favorite count

94
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.270
for the user not for that particular tweet.

95
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.490
So that's not what we want.

96
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.240
We keep on going.

97
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.920
Then we've got the favorite counts right there.

98
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.830
Wonderful.

99
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.310
So that's what we need.

100
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.300
Wonderful.

101
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.040
So that's what we need.

102
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:28.040
So instead of tweet text we'll use tweet and favorite count.

103
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.510
Let's just have a look and check that's returning.

104
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:34.980
The number that we're after.

105
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.940
Wonderful.

106
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.370
There we go.

107
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.330
So we've got a whole range that I want to have that exciting tweet is.

108
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.450
Let's have a look.

109
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.100
So we want to check to see if they tweet

110
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.300
favorite.

111
00:07:51.300 --> 00:08:00.880
Count is greater than cruelty to then

112
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.960
will carry.

113
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.030
We actually need to use print this time.

114
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.500
It's just a string favorite count

115
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:28.260
and next to that we'll put the tweet text as well.

116
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.200
And then we'll move a line break into the if statement.

117
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:44.010
And look something has gone horribly wrong.

118
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.780
Oh sadly I can't spell favorite though I want to.

119
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.100
Fair enough.

120
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.150
There we go.

121
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.670
So now we've got our favorite count and our tweets.

122
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.390
Text if you're interested.

123
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.570
That very popular one was recovered from the Brit Awards.

124
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.980
And then there's another surprisingly popular one about Grimsby as well.

125
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.410
So this is pretty good but it's not the sort of thing I would want to look at every day.

126
00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:13.060
It's not particularly pretty and it doesn't even tell me who made the tweet so I wonder if there's a

127
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.960
way I can display a single tweet.

128
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:26.120
Nicely so I've cheated slightly because it's not the most obvious one but I know that status is embedded

129
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:28.830
is what we need there.

130
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:35.770
So this returns a single tweet specified by the bureau or the ID in an embed format.

131
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:40.600
So as an HD snippet we can include directly on our page.

132
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:48.600
So we're going to need to pass that the ID of our tweet and we do that in the ID variable.

133
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.410
So that should be reasonably straightforward.

134
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.770
Let's do that here.

135
00:09:54.290 --> 00:10:03.290
So we get the tweet Id like that and then I'm going to copy

136
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:11.190
that page that will change this to just status.

137
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:20.500
And then instead of status slash timeline we want to use status is slash Oh and bed and then we want

138
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:32.470
to give an ID that I that ID is going to be tweet ID and we want to send this exclude replies variable

139
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:41.660
and then I'll just close the square bracket that and because we don't know quite what we're going to

140
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.530
get.

141
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.980
Let's print the whole thing.

142
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:51.820
OK.

143
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.240
Let's take a look.

144
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:05.540
It's looking good and you can see we're actually getting nice HDMI all of all of these tweets.

145
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:09.240
Now that looks a lot more pleasant.

146
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.350
So let's have a look.

147
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.810
Where do we get that HDMI out.

148
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.770
It's in the HDMI Melford makes sense.

149
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.960
So let's echo that instead.

150
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:34.460
So it's going to be status IRA or HCM el.

151
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640
Let's take a look.

152
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.360
Take a little while to encode them.

153
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.520
But there we go.

154
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.420
So all in a nice pretty HD MLF I format's

155
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:53.460
and that is only the ones with more than one favorite.

156
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.300
So that's as far as we go.

157
00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.950
So that's as far as I'm going to go with this Twitter client.

158
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.850
You're welcome to make it pretty.

159
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:06.310
Put a nice background and the nav bar up the top if you want but we've done that enough times now for

160
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.640
you to know how to do it.

161
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.950
And it also brings us to the end of the API section of the course.

162
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:19.120
So we've learned how to get the weather how to access Google maps using our API key and how to log into

163
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.710
the Twitter API file.

164
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:28.150
So there's three different types of API but all of them very powerful and actually pretty easy to use

165
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.790
once you know how.

166
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.090
So I hope you enjoy that and I hope you're getting a lot of exciting ideas of how you could use these

167
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:40.480
