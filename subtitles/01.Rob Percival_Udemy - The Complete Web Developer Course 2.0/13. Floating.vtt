00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.590
All right.

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.660
So now we've looked at adding whatever colors we want to see assess we're going to change direction

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.260
a little and look at positioning.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.580
Now so far you probably will have noticed that every paragraph tag and every div just appears directly

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.520
below the previous one.

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.470
Quite often that might be what you want but perhaps we want the green box here to appear on the right

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.490
and the left box to appear over here on the left where the green box currently is.

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.800
How would we achieve that.

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.880
Well we do it using floats and it's actually pretty simple.

10
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.460
So first off I'm just going to change the width of our two divs.

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.740
I've lost my colors somehow.

12
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.090
Every game.

13
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.330
Just so that one's a little wider.

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.000
And this one is a little narrower.

15
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.300
So I make them both 200 pixels so we can see more clearly where they've been moved to.

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.090
So first off let's say we want this green box to appear on the right over here.

17
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.520
Let's give it a go.

18
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:10.820
All we do is we take our first section and add in the styles float right there we go.

19
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.330
And let's take a look see what effect that has we go.

20
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.270
So that floats the green box to the right there.

21
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.060
And you can see that if we expand the page it floats all the way to the right of the page.

22
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.450
However why that is.

23
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.170
Now what happens if we floated to the left.

24
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.740
Let's take a look.

25
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.080
We're now more or less back where we started but without this default margin that we had in place there's

26
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.180
now no gap between the two blocks.

27
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.920
So what if I wanted the green box to be to the left of the blue box.

28
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.990
Well all I do that is flight the blue box left as well.

29
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.810
And there we go.

30
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.770
So you can see the floats come one after the other.

31
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.470
But everything that's floated left will be aligned to the left of the screen.

32
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.330
Similarly if we took the second section now and floated it right.

33
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.060
What impact do you think that would have.

34
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.880
All right you got it.

35
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.170
It was simply align it to the right of the screen.

36
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.910
So if you that's reasonably straightforward we've got floating to the left and floating to the right.

37
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.510
What happens you might be wondering if we combine elements that are floated with elements that aren't

38
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.820
floated.

39
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.380
Let's find out.

40
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:48.660
So if we add a paragraph tag this paragraph is not floated.

41
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.110
So I have a quick guess where do you think it's going to end up.

42
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.010
Find out in the middle.

43
00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.680
Bizarrely enough.

44
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.110
So anything that's not floated is just going to put itself in the flow of the page.

45
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.770
So if we have a list if we bring this in it will try and squeeze itself into the gap.

46
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.400
And if it can't it will put itself underneath the other floated element.

47
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.380
So this is actually a nice way to have say I left menu and a right menu or something like that and then

48
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.130
some content in between.

49
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.160
But what if we wanted our paragraph to appear underneath both of these boxes.

50
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.540
Well there's a fairly easy way to do that as well.

51
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.470
And I'll show you what it is we actually introduce a new div

52
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.160
after the divs that have been floated.

53
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:57.790
And we're going to give this a special style so I'll give it a class of and I'll call it clear flight.

54
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.280
And what this is going to do is effectively clear all of the floats so that anything after appears below

55
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.870
anything that's been floated up here.

56
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:20.820
And the CSSA that we want for that is dots clear float to select that particular div and then we use

57
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.920
clear.

58
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.680
And then you can see we've got the option here we can clear all the left floats if we want or the right

59
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.230
floats but normally we want to clear both left and right floats.

60
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:44.900
So if we do that the paragraph now appears beneath both of these floated divs and that's about it.

61
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.570
So to summarize if you like something to the left it will appear to the left of any non floated content.

62
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.420
If you've liked something to the right it will appear to the right of any non-related content.

63
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.570
And if you want something to appear underneath all of your floated elements then you use clear both

64
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.000
on a special div to achieve that.

65
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.190
Now we'll be looking at floating in a lot more detail later on in the project.

66
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.660
At the end of this section where we'll be recreating the BBC News website.

67
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.120
So as far as we'll go for now.

68
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.380
Feel free to have a little play around and see how floating behaves.

69
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.760
Have lots of floating elements interacting with each other.

70
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:29.940
But we're now going to move on slightly from flights to the related aspect of CSSA positioning.
