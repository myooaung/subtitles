1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,840
So moving on from Naftogaz forms and tables are two things that with plain HTL now it can take a lot

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,780
of efforts to make them look good.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,020
If we have a look at a basic form it's going to get rid of all my nav bar code.

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:31,880
I might have something like email and then an input I'm going to be very minimal code here and then

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,690
a submit button

6
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,040
something like that.

7
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,800
And I'm just going to take out bootstrapped for the moment.

8
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,400
It doesn't look great.

9
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,110
It does the job and the user knows what to do hopefully.

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,670
But it looks pretty 90s.

11
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,040
Similarly with tables.

12
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,960
If we put in a very quick table

13
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:16,980
then in fact I'll be very lazy and just put loads of rubbish in this time

14
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,360
it gets the alignment right.

15
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,300
But other than that it doesn't look like something you'd want to put on your web page.

16
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,570
There are also two elements that are pretty difficult.

17
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,870
Make it look nice responsively that is on a number of different screen sizes from your huge desktop

18
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,970
to your small user's phone.

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,950
Fortunately the bootstrap has us covered.

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:49,830
So let's see how we use bootstrapped to make nice pretty forms and tables.

21
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:59,060
So we'll go back and see the bootstrap Web site in and under components here.

22
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:07,070
I'm going to click on forms and let's scroll down pretty quickly to get something that looks like a

23
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,430
form.

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,420
And there we go.

25
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,300
You can see it looks a lot nicer than your standard form.

26
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,660
And of course because this is bootstrap it's responsive as well.

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,760
So it will change behavior and look nice on a range of different screen sizes.

28
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,670
So as before rather than writing all the code out from scratch I'm going to copy the bootstrap code

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,500
and we'll have a look.

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:30,900
Three

31
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,010
once up and running on our site see how it works.

32
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,180
So there we go.

33
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,210
There's a lovely form we should probably put it in a container.

34
00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:01,000
Because we don't want it spread out right to the end of the screen like that that we get.

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,220
So then you get those nice borders and that responsive effect as well

36
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,300
so you can see the spacing is really nice.

37
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,570
We've got a good bit of padding in the inputs there and all the different elements are styled nicely

38
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,750
and we've got those nice pretty buttons that we saw earlier as well at the bottom.

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,010
So let's have a look see how we code it because it is slightly different.

40
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,620
Obviously this is still HDMI.

41
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,290
So we still have the form element at the beginning.

42
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,050
We then have a field set which is an element that we haven't seen before.

43
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,630
But essentially it's a way of grouping together a number of form elements but often it's only one.

44
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,810
But you can't put more than one in there if you want.

45
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,430
You can see here most of the elements are inside a field set.

46
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:51,980
So we've got our input there and then our password input and then our select etc..

47
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:59,710
So this has a class of form group which gives those styles and then bootstrap uses labels which we have

48
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,050
seen before but we haven't used a great deal.

49
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:09,380
They are a standard HDMI element and the advantage is that the label is then linked to the input itself.

50
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:17,160
So you can style it relatively to that impers. and you can see it's linked via the ID that sort of got

51
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,310
or label them have got our input.

52
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,960
We're used to seeing the type and ID and placeholder.

53
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:30,160
But we've got a class of form control form control is just a way of referring to any form element so

54
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,680
input input there as well.

55
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,350
Select would be a form control text area et cetera.

56
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,940
So that's again what gives it the stylings and worth noting as well.

57
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,120
We've got a type of e-mail here which I don't think we've seen before.

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,790
It's one of the HVM five foot types and it's very well supported by bootstrap.

59
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:54,280
So if you try and submit a form with an invalid email address automatically a warning if the e-mail

60
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,670
address is not correct.

61
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,200
And that's something that we don't need to program in at all but it's something that bootstrapped US

62
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,200
force which is the aim here makes our life a lot easier.

63
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,990
Then we've got some text with a element of small which again we haven't seen before.

64
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,030
But essentially it's just a paragraph tag.

65
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,540
But with small text and this has got the text muted class that we saw in the previous day which makes

66
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,860
it slightly faded as well.

67
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,190
OK.

68
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,050
So that's our e-mail address.

69
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,620
We then closed the field set element and opened up a new one for our password.

70
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,260
And from here on out everything is more or less the same.

71
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,520
So the two classes that are critical here are the form group class and the form control class.

72
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:44,570
So they they give all the styles and the layouts and the rest just follow a very similar structure.

73
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,920
And we're used to seeing radio inputs text areas et cetera.

74
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,950
All right.

75
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,360
So a quick bit of practice then to get this into your head.

76
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,620
So remember those two special classes that we needed.

77
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:04,270
Can you create a simple form that asks for an email address and a password and has a submit button at

78
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,320
the bottom.

79
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,080
Go for it.

80
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,530
OK.

81
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,470
I managed it.

82
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,370
This is what I would do.

83
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll start with my container div.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,180
I didn't specifically say you needed a container div.

85
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,070
So don't worry if you didn't but want.

86
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,540
But with bootstrap unless you want something to specifically go right to the edge of the screen then

87
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,310
I'd recommend putting in a container div every time.

88
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,560
Then we create our form.

89
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,490
No special classes then you get in my tapster line up all day.

90
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:52,930
Then we create a field set with a class of form group that's important class number one.

91
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,800
And then I'm going to create a label for my e-mail address.

92
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:10,110
I just call it email address and I need to specify that this is for and it's for the input that I'm

93
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,570
just about to create which will have an ID of email and then

94
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:25,380
we'll create an input with an idea of email is going to have a type of email as well and it needs to

95
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:32,950
have a class and it needs to have a class of form control.

96
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,740
I'm not going to get a placeholder or anything here will keep it as simple as possible.

97
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,530
That's how Alec we get.

98
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:52,120
So we're looking good already then for our password.

99
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,600
We'll create another field set with another class of phone great

100
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:09,360
and then just as before label for and this is going to have an ID of password

101
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:21,770
and will have an input with a type of password and an ID of password.

102
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:31,040
And of course class of form control.

103
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:39,590
And finally we'll have another field set with a class of perform group

104
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:58,320
and we'll have a button with a type of summit and a class of button and we want a blue one button dash

105
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,950
primary

106
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,170
and I'll just have the text of submit.

107
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,870
All right let's take a look.

108
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,520
There we go.

109
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,020
Fantastic.

110
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,800
So I hope you managed to produce something similar.

111
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,100
It is a good idea when you're learning these things to type it out for yourself at least once.

112
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,670
So you've got it fairly clear in your head what the classes are and how it all fits together.

113
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,570
Once you've done that there's no shame in going back to the bootstrap site and copying and pasting direct

114
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,200
from there OK.

115
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,380
Just before we move on to tables Let's have a little look at some of the alternative layouts and features

116
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,350
of bootstrap forms.

117
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,370
So the standard layout is what we've seen here.

118
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:45,150
The label above the inputs but quite often you might want the label to the left of the input and you

119
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:52,700
can do that very simply just by adding the class form dash in line to the form itself.

120
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,760
So let's have a look and see how that changes things.

121
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:07,530
So what we're doing is adding a single class of form in line and now the form looks like that.

122
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,040
Essentially it's all in a single line.

123
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,090
So that's great for say a small loggin form or maybe a search form at the top of your website but quite

124
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,350
often you won't want the whole thing to be in a line but you will want the labels just to be to the

125
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,970
left of the inputs themselves.

126
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,500
So we just scroll down a little as an option to do that.

127
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,410
There we go.

128
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,010
So this is my favorite lay out because it's using the screen space well for a wide screen.

129
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:42,170
But then if we get narrow enough then it uses the vertical layout again.

130
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:48,620
So a very quick challenge again then can you apply this lay out to the form that we've got here.

131
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,450
Go for it.

132
00:10:51,550 --> 00:11:04,000
Hint there's the H M L you're going to need.

133
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,570
All right.

134
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,680
Have you managed to do that.

135
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:13,600
Notice we're going to remove the inline form class from form and the way this whole thing works is we're

136
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,200
putting columns around our labels and inputs just like we saw in the grid section previously in the

137
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,690
grid's video previously.

138
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:29,590
We've got a two column class on the label and then a 10 column class on the div which contains the input

139
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,180
say I'm going to add a row class to my field set.

140
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,830
You may experiment a little bit here.

141
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,700
It should work fine with field.

142
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:45,130
Even though they're using div here field that is essentially a div Anyway anyway it just semantically

143
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:51,580
clear that we're working with form fields rather than just generic content.

144
00:11:51,720 --> 00:12:03,000
So I'm going to add a class to my label of zero for column small because we want this to switch into

145
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,020
the stack layout when we hit the phone screen size which is s.m and then we'll give that one two columns

146
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:25,090
and then we want a div with a class of again columns small and then 10 columns.

147
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,510
This one

148
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,200
that we get.

149
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,240
So let's just have a quick look.

150
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,630
Looks very good.

151
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,530
So if we expand that.

152
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,510
Yep that looks nice.

153
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,340
And then when we get a narrow enough point it reverts to how it was before.

154
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,420
Great.

155
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,030
So very quickly let's apply that to password as well.

156
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,060
So I'm just going to copy and paste.

157
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,190
Keep things speedy

158
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,580
you've got that class.

159
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:13,290
So the label we can add a row class to the field set and then we can add our div

160
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,640
to surround the password impot

161
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:32,070
excellent of big screen it's going to look great like that with a smaller screen.

162
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,670
It compresses it a little and then very small screen it goes stacked

163
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:39,960
correct.

164
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,260
So that's more or less what I'm going to show you with forms.

165
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,420
Feel free to have a look.

166
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,750
The more layout options here.

167
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,010
They're all pretty useful.

168
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,780
And if you're making complex forms especially then you'll be very grateful for things like inline checkboxes

169
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,980
or radio buttons removing labels.

170
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:05,770
Adding disabled States to inputs read only inputs and one more I'll just show you which is quite nice

171
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:11,910
is adding some info to the end of an input like here.

172
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,510
I really like this layout.

173
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,210
And you do that with the class input group add on.

174
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,620
If you put that before the input then it will add some content before the actual interactive part of

175
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,370
the input.

176
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,720
And then you can add some at the end as well.

177
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,390
So that's bootstrap forms.

178
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,230
They're pretty functional and they're easy to use.

179
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:43,720
Let's have a look now at bootstrap tables which are all of that and more tables will go back to bootstrap

180
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:50,970
and content and then tables.

181
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,250
Remember the lap of your bootstraps type may be slightly different to mine but you should be able to

182
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,520
find tables quite easily.

183
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,260
So we'll go through these a little bit quicker than we did the forms because you've got the idea now

184
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,630
but mostly you can see that these are a lot prettier than normal tables.

185
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,920
So let's copy the code

186
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,450
and we'll see that there's not a great deal

187
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,930
to change that.

188
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,920
So I'll put it just above the form so we can have both at once.

189
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,390
And then let's have a look.

190
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,060
There it is.

191
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,950
So there's a nice pretty table.

192
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:35,960
How are we doing that.

193
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,730
It's actually very simple We've got a table with a class of table.

194
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,080
Pretty much all the work.

195
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:48,930
If we remove that class then the table just reverts back to a normal table albeit with a prettier than

196
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,150
usual.

197
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,710
You can see we've also got a scope attribute here.

198
00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:00,490
This is not actually a bootstrap thing it's a general HLL way of saying that this th which member of

199
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,850
a table header is the header for this row.

200
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,030
So you could also have a T-H with a scope of code for column for example.

201
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,100
But that is kind of considered the default.

202
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,980
So essentially this doesn't make any difference at all.

203
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,130
If we get rid of it then everything will still look exactly the same.

204
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:25,740
It just makes it clear that we're using th but it's not a column header it's a row header.

205
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,100
The rest of the syntax there is exactly the same as the tables that we've looked at before.

206
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:37,370
So let's jump straight to the more fancy things we can do with tables and bootstrap so we can make a

207
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,630
nice inverse table simply enough by using the table inverse class.

208
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,820
Let's have a little look.

209
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:52,220
Notice that pattern again of having an initial class and then other classes which customise that first

210
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,310
class type.

211
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,120
Then again so there's inverse table

212
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:12,480
we can buy classes to the table head against I head Inv. and the default to show different backgrounds

213
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:12,840
there.

214
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,990
And we can apply those to table rows as well.

215
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,800
One of my favorites is the table striped.

216
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:24,810
So let's have a look at that one.

217
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:25,910
There we go.

218
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:32,430
So that just makes a long table especially a lot more readable than if every writer is the same color.

219
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:42,390
And then there are various other ones so you can make it completely boarded overbold like that all with

220
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,490
a single class.

221
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,560
All of these things will be a lot of work to code if you're doing it separate from Twitter and a small

222
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,370
table.

223
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:56,190
And we can apply our usual colorings to the rows and the cells as well using active success.

224
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,430
Info warning danger etc..

225
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,090
And of course we can make our tables responsive as well.

226
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:10,020
All right so now that we've fixed two of the very commonly used HDMI elements tables and forms we're

227
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,720
going to have a run through some of the coolest and most useful bootstrap components in the next video.
