1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:07,530
Excellence so we can now apply our stylings to multiple HDMI elements with just one instruction at the

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:13,710
beginning in our stylesheet which is usually great but what if you have a certain paragraph that you

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,260
want to look different to other paragraphs or this is actually really easy to achieve using classes

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,010
and ideas.

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,160
So let's start with classes and find out how we use those.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,150
First off I'm going to get rid of all my stylings and then just refresh and you can see the page now

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,300
looks completely different even though the HVM out hasn't changed at all.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,790
So let's say I want to make this first paragraph read but not affect the second paragraph.

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:50,340
Well what I do is I apply a class attribute to it and then I can call that class whatever I like.

10
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,470
So if I'm just going to make it red I'll call the class.

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:53,850
Right.

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,650
But I could use any description I want there.

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,010
So if we want to apply some CSSA to the read class we don't just type red to indicate somehow that we're

14
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,490
applying this to a class and to do that we use the full stop or period.

15
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:19,160
So this is known as a class selector because it will select everything with a class of read and then

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,510
we just apply exactly the same pattern as before.

17
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:29,440
So the curly brackets and then color colon right.

18
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:36,530
Segregate them and then that will apply it just two things that have a class of red.

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,110
Now that doesn't necessarily have to be paragraph tags.

20
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,860
I could apply

21
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,720
the class to my H-1 tag as well if I wanted to.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,360
And then that one would be read as well.

23
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,930
So it's a very quick challenge.

24
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,490
Could you apply a class of large to this paragraph tag.

25
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:04,730
The second one and then make it twice as big as the first one ever.

26
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,760
All right happy man is that.

27
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,740
Pretty straightforward.

28
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,830
We just use class.

29
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:23,210
He calls and then lodge in quites and then up in our stylesheet we use dot large to select the large

30
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:32,510
class and then font size colon and then whatever number you wanted to base say 200 percent for it to

31
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,550
be twice as big.

32
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,870
Take a look fantastic.

33
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,170
So really easy to manipulate things in this way.

34
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,070
Really nice other feature is that we can apply multiple classes to a single element so if we wanted

35
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:53,870
this first paragraph to be red and large we just put a space between them and type them both in their

36
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,450
red and large.

37
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,800
Let's have a look.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,060
Fantastic that is now red and large.

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,250
So that's how classes work.

40
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,880
I work in a very very similar way.

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:14,400
So let's add another pair of paragraph tags and this time will give them an ID and let's say I'm going

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,040
to make this particular paragraph Taghreed.

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,390
So I'll call the ID green and we'll just have some very boring essays more text

44
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:25,950
ok.

45
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,230
We have a look at that of course there's no styling applied to that paragraph yet.

46
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,970
So it's not great.

47
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,330
But if you want to make a green we can do very easily.

48
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:41,180
The difference is because we're working with ID's rather than classes now instead of the period or full

49
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,800
stop.

50
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,850
We use the hash which are my keyboard is old.

51
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,350
Three years is probably around there somewhere as well but it might be the other side of the keyboard.

52
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,790
And then the name of an ID.

53
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:04,600
So green and this is then an ID selector and it will select IDs with the name of green and then it's

54
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,870
exactly the same as before color green I will look fabulous.

55
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,120
So it works in exactly the same way.

56
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,590
We use a hash instead of a full stop or period.

57
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,550
So you might be wondering well why do we have classes and ideas then.

58
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,080
Well essentially they have slightly different uses.

59
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,570
And the main thing about IDS is they should only be used once per page.

60
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,950
So you might have different sections of the page for example and you might give them specific IDs because

61
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,950
those sections are unique within the page.

62
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,470
You probably wouldn't.

63
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,760
To be honest use an ID of green because you might want to make several things green.

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,120
So essentially that's the difference.

65
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,700
Classes can be used more than once IDs only once and will actually come back to classes and IDs again

66
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,890
in javascript as ways of interacting with and moving around objects.

67
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,380
And then the idea of classes and IDS will become very important once again.

68
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,560
All right so that's classes and ideas.

69
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,560
One more thing I want to show you is how we might style some text within a paragraph tag.

70
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:17,420
So if for example we want to add and this text is underlined then how would we underline just that portion

71
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,820
of it using internal CSSA.

72
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,260
Well we do that using the span HCM element.

73
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:36,490
And then this span is simply something that we can put around any chunk of text or image or combination

74
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,950
of several different things and then use that to select it.

75
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:53,700
So if for example we gave this a class of red then only the latter bit would be red of course we want

76
00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:01,360
it to be underlined So that's have a class of underlined and then we'll add in

77
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:11,860
Dot underlined to select the underlined class and then to underline something we use text decoration

78
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,700
and underline that we get.

79
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,900
And at this point you don't need to remember any of these will introduce them a lot more familiar with

80
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,280
them as we go through this section.

81
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,430
Let's just have a look there we.

82
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,100
So the text is underlined.

83
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,740
So that's how we apply styles to text within some paragraph text.

84
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,270
So that's as far as we're going to go with classes and ideas.

85
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,220
In this video and the next one I'll be introducing the DIV tag which we did see at the beginning of

86
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,350
the HVM L section but you can be forgiven for forgetting it.

87
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:55,550
Now we'll find out what its purpose is and how you can use it to apply styles to a group of HTL elements.

88
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,090
See that.
