1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,130
So now I've got a pretty big challenge for you.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:10,000
Our aim here is to create a simple email client that we could use as a mobile app which allows the user

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,990
to send an email to and from anyone they like.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:19,060
So when someone first uses the app they might send to a new user and then they can put their e-mail

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,550
address in there.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,790
They from email

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,400
a message

8
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,320
nice and simple.

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:42,430
And then when they click send that links via Ajax to a p p script which then sends the e-mail for them

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:48,520
and returns true and the app interprets this as a successful send.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:58,950
It also knows if for example there is no field that the e-mail couldn't be sent as well as that the

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,900
e-mail addresses that are used automatically appear in the e-mail address list here.

13
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,610
And when the user clicks on them it sets up an email to that e-mail address.

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,000
All of those are saved with hate mail.

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,160
Local storage.

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,460
So they're stored permanently for the user to give you a quick glance at what we're creating on the

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,720
server side.

18
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,810
We've got a fairly simple script which attempts to send the email and then create some.

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,260
Or more specifically Jason P to allow the app to read the response and know whether or not it's successful.

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,510
So there's a lot to cover there.

21
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,750
But I think you should be able to figure out at least most of that yourself.

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,980
But of course you're very welcome to watch me give it a go.

23
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,340
If you'd rather.

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,150
The way.

25
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:50,510
Best of luck.

26
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:50,990
All right.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,400
I love that.

28
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:58,490
Well I'm going to start with the HVM L side of the app and build up our user interface fast and they

29
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,380
will create our HP API when we're done.

30
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:09,220
So I'm just going to commands it all the way back to the app J.S.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,430
site that we had

32
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,290
a couple of years ago.

33
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,240
I would say just make sure everything's still working great.

34
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,880
So I think I'm going to go for the blue menu bar at the top.

35
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:38,960
And I'm going to do that just by adding the class blue to the top bar there and then I'll just get rid

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,500
of everything that we don't need.

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,480
So we don't need the scroll page.

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,570
I'm going to leave the key frames in there might be important for one of these animations and we're

39
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,220
not going to be using the color picker.

40
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,230
So I'm going to get rid of all of that.

41
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,990
So I pretty much all the styles in fact are gone.

42
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:16,050
So let's get rid of our color picker but we will be using the app section here without buttons so let's

43
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:25,950
get rid of all of those apart from 1 and we'll change the data target to send e-mail.

44
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:34,470
That's what I'm going to call the div of my e-mail sending page and then we can keep this section as

45
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,080
well.

46
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,320
But this is still going to go to send email

47
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,430
and I'll just change the text to send to New User

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,370
OK.

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,660
And then we don't need page 2.

50
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,520
In fact we don't need any of these pages

51
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,580
and

52
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,510
we don't need this code either.

53
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,780
So let's just leave it's an absolutely minimal code base.

54
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,690
Definitely don't want to leave any code in that we're not going to be using

55
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,570
let's just update the title to send an e-mail

56
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,290
click below to send an e-mail.

57
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,290
It's a pretty simple proposition.

58
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:45,580
Obviously this lists section here is not going to be shown initially but we'll leave that for now until

59
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,210
we add all our local storage functionality.

60
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,120
OK.

61
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,350
Then as I mentioned we're going to need the

62
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,880
page from inputs here which actually contains something pretty similar to what we're going to use to

63
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,130
send email.

64
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:15,760
So again I'm going to view frame source and I'm interested in inputs.

65
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,570
So that's Command F to search for inputs.

66
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,180
There we go.

67
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,770
It's definitely called inputs.

68
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,540
And here's the code that we need.

69
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:32,290
And for that Solon's copy that down and we'll have a look at it.

70
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,110
Once we've copied it over.

71
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,240
So this is a page as we're used to it's called a top bar that's renamed that's

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,070
to send email we might want to keep that button then.

73
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,060
And then we've got to search.

74
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,830
We definitely aren't interested in any search here.

75
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,060
So I'm going to get rid of

76
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,150
that line but we'll leave the rest because we're going to want something pretty similar to that.

77
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,940
And let's update the data page to send email

78
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,240
OK.

79
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,270
We should now be able to click on these and we get to the send email page.

80
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,830
So let's now look at the Send an e-mail page or ditto.

81
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,480
We're going to want a send and recipient e-mail address at the top there and we can actually leave subject

82
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,650
and message as they are.

83
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,140
So let's

84
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:48,710
call that send the e-mail address and we'll give it an I.D. of send.

85
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,440
Email and then we'll have another section

86
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,030
underneath with an input of recipient email

87
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,390
OK.

88
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,560
Let's take a look.

89
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,730
Great.

90
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,370
So the first time the user runs the app none of these will be pre-filled in.

91
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,770
But once the user has sent an e-mail we want these to be saved.

92
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,730
So let's add our code to do that.

93
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,150
This is going to be in the send e-mail page.

94
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,460
So I'm going to copy the app control code

95
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,960
and add it for the send email page using the data page attribute them.

96
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,710
And I want my code to happen when the send button is pressed.

97
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:54,390
So let's first give this send button an id call it send button and then we want to run our code

98
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,940
to set up the click function.

99
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,670
When the page is loaded so we're going to use the send e-mail attribute here.

100
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,490
There we go.

101
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,520
And as always we take one.

102
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,640
And as always we take things one step at a time and just do a quick alerts to make sure it's working.

103
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,500
There we go.

104
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,300
And then we want to do something if it's clicked.

105
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,640
Now we've seen some code from that down here somewhere.

106
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,590
Here we go.

107
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:42,200
So it's a little bit different to what we're used to but I think it's fairly easily transferable.

108
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:48,510
So we're looking to find an element again but this time we're looking for the element with the send

109
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,660
button I.D. We're making it clickable.

110
00:08:51,660 --> 00:09:01,990
And then when it's click click we're running some code and again we'll just do a quick alert to make

111
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,430
sure that the on click method is all set up correctly.

112
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,610
All right let's give it a go.

113
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,940
Wonderful.

114
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,000
But of course what we're really going to do here.

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,770
Is attempt to send the e-mail but I'm going to add the code for that later on.

116
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,360
For now we're looking at our local storage.

117
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,970
So let's make that happen.

118
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,510
So let's start off by checking to see if local storage is available.

119
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:44,420
That we look at type of local storage and we want to check that that's not undefined

120
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,550
and if it is for now I'll just put a message

121
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,900
saying that will allow the use of that we couldn't save the data.

122
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,400
It wouldn't cause a problem with email.

123
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:14,030
It just means that we won't save that email addresses etc. and then either here will start off by saving

124
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,710
the sender email address.

125
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,820
Now that's nice and easy because there's only one of them.

126
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:24,270
So let's just remind ourselves what we call that sense they send the email ID.

127
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:33,630
So we're going to set local storage set item and I'll call it the same thing.

128
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:46,970
So I send e-mail and we want to set that see the value of the Send the email field so send the email

129
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,210
again and found.

130
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,660
Now before we move on to saving the recipient email address I'm just going to check that that's all

131
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,510
working.

132
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,940
So we should be able to set up the e-mail address here.

133
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,490
So let's first check again to see if local storage is available.

134
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,210
And I wouldn't have an else this time this time.

135
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:19,990
I want to check to see if a particular variable exists and that is the send the e-mail variable.

136
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:31,880
So I'm looking for local storage to get item send the email and I can check that that exists to see

137
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:44,790
by checking if it's not equal to no and if it doesn't then I want to update the value of the send the

138
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,930
e-mail input.

139
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:53,650
And we do that using page to find and then send e-mail

140
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:13,270
with a hash ID and we want to set the value of that to local storage get item send email.

141
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:19,680
So all of that should have the effect of when we save our local storage data when the user clicks and

142
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:26,180
we then load up the page again and we should see the send the e-mail address populated there.

143
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,190
So let's get this again.

144
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:38,520
Just refresh and then click to open up the email and then I'll put in Roback code styles dot com and

145
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,600
then click send.

146
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,940
So nothing happens there but hopefully the local storage got activated in the background and then I'm

147
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,790
going to refresh again and click back on here and there we get it.

148
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,580
It's been populated wonderful So we're now saving the sender email permanently.

149
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,880
Just to clarify that that is the send the e-mail.

150
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:05,770
I think I'm going to add a from text to text there.

151
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,680
Let's have a look.

152
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,090
Yep.

153
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,820
Great.

154
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,590
OK so now let's do the recipient e-mail address.

155
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,540
Now this is a bit more complicated because we need to save it in an array.

156
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,940
And we only want to save it if it's not already there.

157
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,740
So first off let's see if that right exists.

158
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:31,690
So I will check to see if local stores get item and then I'll call it recipient

159
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,950
list.

160
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,620
If that's not equal to.

161
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,410
No.

162
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,710
Then we'll set

163
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,730
recipient list equal to that

164
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,930
in fact what I think all day is all set.

165
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,480
The recipient list to be a new

166
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:19,560
array outside there and then I'll just update it if it doesn't already exist in the local storage.

167
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,190
So now we've got recipient list as an array and it's either equal to the contents of the local storage

168
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,620
or it's empty.

169
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,430
So now we want to see if the recipient email address is in the array.

170
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,080
That's the sort of thing that's probably a query function for.

171
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:44,070
So let's have a look check to see if in a race something like that like about an array.

172
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,720
Perfect.

173
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,680
So let's jump down for an example.

174
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:59,580
So in a way and then we're looking for the item that in the array that K..

175
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,360
So let's do our check.

176
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:11,840
So we're checking to see if the recipient email which is this they're say if

177
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:22,070
and we want recipient email foul and we want to see if it's in the array.

178
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,100
So we're going to use Jey query docked in array

179
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:39,450
and we're checking to see if that value is in the array recipient list and we actually want to check

180
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,700
that it's not in there right here.

181
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:48,670
And you can see here that the value that we get from the NRA function if it's not in it is minus one.

182
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,370
So we're going to check to see if

183
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,020
that is equal to A minus 1

184
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:06,610
and because I've written quite a lot of code so far I'm going to do a check at this point that we're

185
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:12,770
still working and nothing's going to horribly wrong.

186
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,950
So let's just put something in there and we've got a small problem there.

187
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:24,460
I think it's because we're using Jay query here which was what the example had on our test up here.

188
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,970
But actually the standard for

189
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,970
using Jay Querrey functions is the dollar sign.

190
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,250
So let's try using that instead.

191
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,220
That we get it could be that sceptered doesn't support using a query and dollar.

192
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,550
So if it's not in the array we want to add it to the array.

193
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,900
Really remember how to do this.

194
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,760
We use recipient list dot push.

195
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,010
And then they think that we want to add.

196
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,460
So that is of course recipient email

197
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,110
Vout.

198
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:11,890
And what I'm going to see next is just look to the console.

199
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,590
Recipient list just to make sure that this is happening.

200
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:28,460
So now I'm just going to put one and two and then inspect and let's have a look.

201
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,400
We should see that we've got an array.

202
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,140
And yep it's saving each one but it's not saving recipient list each time.

203
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,880
That's not a problem.

204
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,740
That just means we need to save it to local storage.

205
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,880
So remember this is an array that is save it we're going to have to convert it to Jason because we can

206
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,330
only source strings in local storage so we'll use local storage.

207
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,440
Set item.

208
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:05,120
The item that we want to set is recipient list and the value that we want to set it see is J-Zone string

209
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:12,190
if I and the recipient list array.

210
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,170
And similarly when we get it back we're going to need to convert it from a Jason string to an array.

211
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:27,310
And we can do that using J-Zone pass as we saw in the previous video.

212
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:37,390
So now it should not only save the latest one but save all of them say let's save number one maybe I

213
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,680
can get that saved number two.

214
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,310
Great.

215
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:48,670
We've got one and T number five for him.

216
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,280
So that's saving very nicely and small thing I'd like to do while we're here is to put them into alphabetical

217
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,510
order so that users not looking down the big list of email addresses trying to find the right one say

218
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,280
see if we can find a way to do that.

219
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,030
And we got a few options here.

220
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:11,150
But J javascript array sort seems pretty perfect for us.

221
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,390
So let's apply that here.

222
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:23,740
So the recipient list Daut sort.

223
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:30,360
So let's refresh and then I'll put in the number for my recipient list.

224
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,420
And there we go.

225
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,280
So not only is it added number four but it's put it in the right places.

226
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,400
Well just try number three.

227
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,590
OK so that's looking good.

228
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,360
Or do you just want to get rid of those numbers so that we can replace them with email addresses so

229
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:52,220
I can do that just by commenting out this line once and then refreshing

230
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,030
and I'm going to put my friend at exampled up come

231
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,070
there we go.

232
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,480
And that's reset the array.

233
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,430
So if I now bring that back in and refresh the page

234
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:22,920
I have a friend for example to come and then say that with then got the two e-mail addresses saved.

235
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,760
Wonderful.

236
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,750
So we're almost finished on the front end side.

237
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:34,400
The only thing I want to add at this point is for the users e-mail contacts to be listed here.

238
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,290
So let's remind ourselves where that is.

239
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,310
It's our pay him.

240
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,740
So it's in app section.

241
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,220
Let's give this an I.D.

242
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,750
of contact list and then we're going to want to do is when this page is loaded.

243
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:56,500
Want to check to see if the user has any contacts and if so make them appear they're.

244
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,160
So we're going to be doing that on the home page here.

245
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:06,560
So once again we want to check to see if local storage is available

246
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,910
which we do that way and then we'll also check to see if

247
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,640
local storage get item.

248
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,660
And what we're looking for is the recipient list

249
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,990
is not no

250
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,330
and so if that's the case we want to get our recipient list again.

251
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,010
Let's create our array.

252
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,670
And in fact we can use the same code here.

253
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,390
To pass it convert it from Jason to an array.

254
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,040
Then we're going to want to loop through that array.

255
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,790
You can possibly remember how to do that.

256
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:11,790
But let's just remind ourselves that we get the jey query each function get ourselves a nice example.

257
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,730
Yep that looks familiar.

258
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:29,510
So we're going to loop through the the recipient list or array and yeah for now I'll just alert value.

259
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:36,030
So that should mean that when we load the app it will alert my friend for example to come and then my

260
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,530
other friend and example to dot com.

261
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,230
Great.

262
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,670
I didn't actually want to alert them though I want them to appear where it says lists at the moment

263
00:22:46,800 --> 00:23:01,820
say I want to take the contact list ID and at a number of days to its one for each recipient to get

264
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,390
some indenting first off.

265
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,990
So we don't want to let the value

266
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:17,870
but we do want see just take the contact list.

267
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,620
So that's that

268
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:33,420
and we want to spend to that day of which I remember means add on the end

269
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:48,540
and we want to put the value in that.

270
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,740
All right let's take a look.

271
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,190
And something's going wrong there.

272
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:01,390
I think it's because we're doing this the old fashioned way and we actually need to search the page

273
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,760
with objects.

274
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,460
So we look in page and then find and that's where we put our ID

275
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,750
site contact list.

276
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,370
So just as we did it there.

277
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,760
Let's try that again.

278
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
There we go.

279
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,030
Wonderful.

280
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,790
And I'm just going to add in a little bit of code which hides the contact list.

281
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,010
If there's no contacts in it.

282
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:38,820
So if the recipient list is empty then we'll find the contact list in the same way and hide it and just

283
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,520
in case we need to we'll show it there as well because it might be that it's hidden and then we get

284
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,380
back to it.

285
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,560
I'm willing to share it in that case.

286
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,580
Great.

287
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:55,860
So now back here if we click on one of those and at the moment nothing happens when we click those.

288
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:02,110
And that's because when they were added in this way the code attached to the data Target Field wasn't

289
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,000
activated.

290
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,850
So we're going to have to do that ourselves.

291
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,910
And essentially we want to do two things.

292
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:15,760
When one of these buttons is pressed to jump to the send e-mail page and you want to set the active

293
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,170
e-mail the active recipient e-mail that is to whichever one has been tapped.

294
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:25,230
So jumping to another page is not something we've seen how to do yet.

295
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,990
So let's see if we can find some way in the docs for.

296
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,090
To have a look.

297
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:38,560
So we're familiar with that things to note we're pretty familiar with pages this is where we are.

298
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,850
Aha.

299
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:48,990
This code looks very promising so that loads the page home wonderful.

300
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,230
That's exactly what we need.

301
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:57,910
So let's add a new class to these links.

302
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,850
We don't need the data target attribute anymore.

303
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:14,320
So if we just add a class of direct and then once we've finished this process we'll add our redirect

304
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,580
function to those links.

305
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:28,490
So we're going to need to look in the page again and find anything with a class of direct.

306
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,070
And as we did down here let's make it clickable and then on click

307
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,100
just check it.

308
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:49,420
We need print sees that and then on click and we want a function

309
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:03,110
every day and I'll just put those on separate lines to keep things tidy.

310
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,480
Heasley have the dots at the beginning.

311
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,230
So again just to check that everything is connected.

312
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,290
We'll just have a quick alert.

313
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,680
Things are looking good.

314
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,720
So we want to do two things.

315
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,310
Remember we want to redirect upload.

316
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:37,890
Let's do that bit first because at the bit where little unfamiliar with and we want to redirect to the

317
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,490
send email page.

318
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,560
So let's have a look.

319
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,440
First off wonderful.

320
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:52,300
And then the second thing we're going to do is use local storage to save the e-mail address so that

321
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:59,240
we can access it again on the sendmail page and put it there in the recipient email address.

322
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,200
So let's use local storage.

323
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,230
Set item and I'll call it recipient email

324
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:23,610
and we want to set that equal to the value of this does which we should be able to get using this and

325
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,740
then.

326
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:34,090
That will give us the HVM hour of the day that was clique's which is the e-mail address that we want.

327
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,790
Again just to check.

328
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,920
I think I'll do a quick alert that that's going to get it right.

329
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,590
And I think both of those should happen before we redirect the page.

330
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,930
Otherwise it might do the redirect and then not run our code.

331
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,870
So let's check first of all excellent.

332
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:57,260
We've got the data and then it's doing the redirect.

333
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:02,670
So now we can get rid of the alert and then we need to do now is add the code to make this recipient

334
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:08,350
email address appear when they send email page is loaded.

335
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,830
So we've already got a function here to check if local storage is up and running.

336
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,620
So let's add other function inside that.

337
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,520
So now we're looking for local storage get item.

338
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:28,780
And the thing we want to get is recipient email.

339
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:37,640
So let's check to see if that is not null and if it's not then we want to update the recipient email

340
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:47,360
address so we use page again to access the page and then find to find our recipient email which I think

341
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,670
is just recipient e-mail but that's just check.

342
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,770
Then we get an e-mail.

343
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,370
Yep.

344
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,710
And then we want to set the value to

345
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:11,330
local storage get the item recipient email

346
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,480
beryllium.

347
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,460
So now that's already worked wonderful when the user clicks on one of these.

348
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:28,980
It will save recipient e-mail in local storage and then if that exists when we send an e-mail then it

349
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,140
will update that other page.

350
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,770
Wonderful.

351
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,830
Just one tiny thing to fix.

352
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:43,050
If we click send to new user now then that will still remember the recipient emails saved previously

353
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,770
which is not the behavior we want.

354
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:58,370
So when the new user button is clicked we need to remove the recipient e-mail variable from local storage.

355
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:04,260
So let's add an ID to that or call it new user

356
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:12,700
and then we want to add some code for it.

357
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:18,540
I'll do that once again inside the local storage is defined if statement.

358
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:30,510
So again we want to page find and then I've got a ready what I called it New User very sensible

359
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:45,000
and then not certain we need clickable about I'll put it there anyway.

360
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:51,410
And then on click we want a function.

361
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:59,610
And as usual I'll do a quick alert to see if we're poor connected up.

362
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,440
We are indeed.

363
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:10,200
And then ideally we want to remove that item from local storage which is not something we've done before.

364
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,980
So let's see if we can figure out a way to do it.

365
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:22,000
Local storage remove item ha storage don't remove the item that looks so perfect.

366
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,410
I don't think we even need to click on it.

367
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,570
And in fact we've got the example in the second was out there.

368
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,340
So local storage don't remove item.

369
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,290
So let's try that's

370
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:46,840
remove item and then the key is recipient email and we do only want to do that if it exists.

371
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,750
So we should do a quick check really.

372
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:56,440
So if local storage gets item recipient email

373
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,430
is not equal to.

374
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,680
Then remove it.

375
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,150
OK.

376
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:17,590
So let's just check now if we click send to new user and that didn't quite work.

377
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:27,740
And that's because the code to remove the item here is actually happening after the redirect takes place.

378
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:34,540
So if we click done and then send to new user again then we do have a blank email address here.

379
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:41,170
So in order to stop that from happening there is as is often the case a number of ways of doing it.

380
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:52,510
But the way I'm going to fix it is to remove this data target from the app button in class and then

381
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,780
do the redirect manually.

382
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:01,070
And so we'll check to see if we need to remove the item and remove it if we need to.

383
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,610
And either way we won't see hap dot load.

384
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:15,130
They send the e-mail page and this would just make sure that the item gets removed before the e-mail

385
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,860
page is loaded.

386
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,070
So let's take a look.

387
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:28,470
So now we've got it in the To field and then we send to a user and the field is blank.

388
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,060
So now our front end is working pretty much as we wanted to.

389
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:37,370
We've got our local story saving our users contact email addresses in a particular order and they can

390
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:42,400
click to send to one of those or they can send to a new user.

391
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:47,950
And either way whatever e-mail address they use last time is going to appear in the From field.

392
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,240
So we're looking at it now it's just the small matter of actually sending the e-mail.

393
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:57,480
And then of course feeding back to our code here that the email has been sent.

394
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,180
So to do that we're going to need to use some ph.

395
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,080
We can't send e-mail using javascript but we can using a server side language.

396
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:14,730
So I'm going back over to the fire FTB and I'm going to create a new directory which is going to be

397
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,730
nine mobile apps

398
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:33,770
and I'll create a new file within that called Send email to HP.

399
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:39,700
So I'm going to use command control in windows to open that up in brackets.

400
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,150
And then

401
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:53,740
that's just do a quick save to make sure that we've got it open and then find it online.

402
00:35:53,790 --> 00:36:00,510
So it's going to be complete web developer called dot com slash content slash 9 hyphen mobile Papps

403
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:09,720
slash send email to HP because you are you're you are l is going to be different depending on your domain

404
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,270
name.

405
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,130
OK.

406
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,230
So we've got two challenges here.

407
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:19,800
One we need to receive the data from the app to tell us who to send the email to who just end it from

408
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,080
what the subject a message should be.

409
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:27,790
And then we need to report back to the app to say whether or not this ending was successful.

410
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:33,690
So we're going to be using AJAX within the app and will need to return our data in Jason format so that

411
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,490
it can be read across domains.

412
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,940
So let's set up our malfunction first.

413
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,820
I think we can lose the app jast tabs.

414
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:52,540
And I'm just going to do a quick search for HP malfunction and then I'm going to jump to a stack overflow

415
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,540
question and here we go.

416
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,630
So I've got some nice headers there.

417
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:13,140
So usually getting the code from the web will save us a fair bit of time and get some accurate headers

418
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,990
hopefully as well.

419
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,840
So I'm going to be parsing these as get variables.

420
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:29,750
So we'll have to forward to a subject for subject

421
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,030
message for message and then

422
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:53,800
we're using from four from as well.

423
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:02,550
That we get to now I should be able to do a little test.

424
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,320
I'm actually going to change that to an echo.

425
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,240
So we'll see hopefully a one when this has been successful.

426
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:27,680
Say two I'll use rope Rob Percival that it you came and from all use Rob at Comp..

427
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:33,170
Web Developer of course dot com a note when you're testing your e-mails are less likely to be seen as

428
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:38,190
spam if you use a from address which matches the domain name so that if you can.

429
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,730
So that will help with testing.

430
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,140
If it doesn't appear in your inbox then spam filtering could be the problem.

431
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:57,310
And then we'll have subject that's just going to be test and message.

432
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,690
This is a test.

433
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,470
All right.

434
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,530
So we've got a one that's a good sign.

435
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:12,010
And just to show that it doesn't send absolutely anything get rid of the send the e-mail address and

436
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,040
then reload the page

437
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,440
then we don't have a one there.

438
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,020
OK.

439
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:30,640
So that now seems to be where so all that remains on the server side of things is to Outlook.

440
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:35,910
Jason P so that we can read it using AJAX in our app.

441
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,050
Again that's something we haven't done before.

442
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,930
So let's see how we do it.

443
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,690
Here we go.

444
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,190
How do I create Jason pay.

445
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,620
That looks pretty perfect.

446
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,570
Have a scroll down.

447
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,970
And here we go.

448
00:39:53,970 --> 00:40:01,590
So we create a callback parameter in the get variable then return that as part of our Jaison.

449
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:08,520
So let's copy this code over.

450
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:18,250
So this is what we need but we need to create our Jason first and we'll do that from an array.

451
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,320
So let's

452
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,520
set up a result right.

453
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:38,540
And we'll have result success equal to the output of the mail function which will either be true or

454
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,740
false depending on whether it was successful or not.

455
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:47,600
And then instead of using the data variable here we'll use Jason in code

456
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,020
result and we've used the Jason code function before.

457
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,760
But it creates Jason from an array.

458
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,070
OK.

459
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,330
So let's just have a quick look and see what that returns.

460
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:15,210
So nothing at the moment because I haven't but they call back in them.

461
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:23,580
So let's just say that equal to something and then we get a response and then our Jason and just in

462
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:30,120
case there isn't a callback at some output there they're not that we particularly need that because

463
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,030
it won't work without a callback anyway.

464
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,790
But better to have that than nothing at all.

465
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:54,020
OK so now we can shut down our Send email PSAP and I'm going to put out code for the moment in the send

466
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,870
email page.

467
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:03,440
So as always before I do anything I'm just going to do a quick alert to make sure we're all connected

468
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:15,650
up and then I'm actually going to jump over to the septet page to get some code to work with for Ajax

469
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:20,370
just in case it's in any way different.

470
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:30,390
To the query approach if you want to stick with stand J query of course then you can get rid of Zapato

471
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:34,230
and just add the query javascript instead.

472
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,730
But with any luck

473
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,750
we gay should work for us.

474
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,860
So let's add our Kate

475
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:51,250
there.

476
00:42:51,260 --> 00:43:02,040
So the we're used to the Ajax and get the you are el will start of just being this complete you are

477
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,000
all here with the callback in there.

478
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:16,850
We'll leave the data as is for now and then we should get a success field in the Jason.

479
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:22,780
So we should be able to get that by just alerting data dots.

480
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:30,770
Success and the final thing to check before we run this is to change from Jason to Jason.

481
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,830
Pete.

482
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:44,270
Now let's say fats and refresh and then we get we've got a full response which is great.

483
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:50,440
So next we need to send the correct variables to our script so rather than just name is Zip toto.

484
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Yes we need to tend to from subject and content and I'm going to do that as just fixed variables for

485
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,730
the moment.

486
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,610
So I'll send it to Rob.

487
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,510
Well Percival took care of you OK.

488
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:13,280
I'll send it from Rob.

489
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:20,040
Complete web developer course dot com.

490
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:26,000
I'll set the subject to be test on the content.

491
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,770
It's just this is a test

492
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,810
case and now when we run that we should get a true response.

493
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,610
We can bring in.

494
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,190
So things are looking good.

495
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:46,400
Let's then update our code so that we send the users values of from to subject and content rather than

496
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,800
these fixed ones.

497
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:51,680
So if you remember those are stored up here.

498
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:56,330
So we've already got an ID for send the email and recipient e-mail.

499
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:04,850
So let's just add in an ID for subject and also for content.

500
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,290
And now we can refer to those down here.

501
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,890
So the two variable is going to be

502
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:31,160
recipient email at Val and then I'll just copy that and the from variable is going to be send the email.

503
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:44,620
Val subject is going to be subject to Vau and content will be content.

504
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:51,530
Rationalises from that again make sure we're still getting a true response and there we go.

505
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:52,640
Actually yes that's correct.

506
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:58,030
We're getting a focused response because we don't have a recipient email address in there at the moment.

507
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,170
So that's what we would expect.

508
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:11,410
OK so now I'm going to move this string to send the e-mail down to where it should be.

509
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:18,790
So on this kickable link i.e. when the send button is clicked.

510
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,090
So let's take a look at an e-mail address in here.

511
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:34,050
And a subject and a message and then send and there we go.

512
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,100
We get our true response.

513
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:37,440
All right.

514
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:38,950
So we're very very close now.

515
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:43,780
It's just a matter of having a more friendly response to the use of alerting.

516
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,940
True or false.

517
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,700
So we're going to do that in the usual way.

518
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,860
We'll have an S..

519
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,220
Dave

520
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:04,080
at the top of the page which will initially be empty and we'll give that an I.D. of message

521
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,280
and notice that we do see a little bit of that Dave.

522
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,150
So let's hide it when the page is loaded.

523
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:29,260
Say a page find and we want a message

524
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:34,760
right and then we'll just show it when we need it.

525
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:38,980
OK.

526
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:49,360
So down here instead of alerting day to success we're now checking to see if data dots success is equal

527
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,200
to true

528
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:53,550
then

529
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,380
we'll set

530
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:14,110
the message give content to your email was sent successfully.

531
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,720
And if it wasn't we'll just put a fairly generic error message

532
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:28,810
your e-mail could not be sent.

533
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,910
Please try again later.

534
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:40,380
And we'll actually do the same thing down here if we get a jack Zayra as well.

535
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:43,950
OK.

536
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,370
And for each of those We'll also have to show

537
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:57,860
that if so that the user can see it.

538
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,330
All right.

539
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,690
So let's take a look.

540
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,990
I'm actually going to go back and this and set that example

541
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:09,530
hi how are you.

542
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:13,170
And then send your email was sent successfully.

543
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:13,990
Fantastic.

544
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,750
So that's actually as far as I'm going to go with this app.

545
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,550
Well done for following all the way through.

546
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:23,630
I hope you did manage to do a fair bit of it yourself what you've created here could be the basis of

547
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,000
almost any HDMI based app.

548
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:33,860
That's what we've built is a nice looking and fluid Front-End based in HCM L and we've built a Ph back

549
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:39,350
end as well which for a more complex app could connect to a database and contain user log in details

550
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,430
or anything you like.

551
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:46,110
So even though the usage here is pretty simple a structure that we've used is extremely powerful.

552
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,370
I hope you're having ideas of apps that you could make in this way.

553
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,410
There are of course many options for improvement here.

554
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:57,740
One small bug you may have noticed is that if you attempt to send an email with a blank email address

555
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,410
it will save that blank email address in the list.

556
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:04,280
I'm going to leave that was a small challenge for you to figure out how to stop that happening.

557
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,100
We also obviously don't have any validation on email addresses here.

558
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:15,170
So we allow invalid email addresses and we don't give a great deal of information in the error message

559
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,050
as well.

560
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,950
We just said the email could not be sent.

561
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:24,810
So will be very nice to have some checking here to see that the e-mail addresses were valid and that

562
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:28,590
they were present and that that was a subject and a message.

563
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:35,160
We could also do with giving the user the option to delete e-mail addresses from their contact list

564
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:36,390
if we wanted to.

565
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,630
So plenty to do that.

566
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:43,420
But also a strong basis for any app that you wanted to make once you've made your app.

567
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,310
The next challenge is to get it onto the app stores.

568
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:50,720
And that's why I'm going to show you how to do using phone get built in the next video.
