1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,270
OK now we know how to style our text.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,530
We're going to see how we can align it.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,170
So this essentially means having it on the left of the page the right of the page in the middle or justify

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,150
it's spread out to fill the whole page.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:22,620
So let's take just our first paragraph and we'll get rid of the bold class

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:34,300
because we don't going to be bold anymore or not in terms of CSSA any way that we get.

7
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:43,660
So if I want this text aligned to the right of the page then I simply do text a line and then I can

8
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,590
see the options there.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,210
The one that I want this time of course is right.

10
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,690
And very simple.

11
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:57,340
I will align it to the right of the page or to be more precise I should say it will align it's to the

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,280
right of the parent element.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,640
So this is the element which this is contained in so the paragraph tag is currently contained within

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,490
the body tag so it aligns to the right of the body tag which is essentially the right of the page.

15
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,060
But if I put it inside say a DIV tag

16
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:31,120
and then I set that div tag to have say a width of maybe 300 pixels.

17
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,620
And let's do a background color as well.

18
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:45,900
Just hope we can see it really clearly then you can see the text lines to the right of the div because

19
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,580
the paragraph tag is now contained within the div.

20
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:55,640
So this alignment applies to the container element or the parent element.

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,100
OK.

22
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,190
I'm just going to set a height for this div as well so it's a little bit bigger and then you can see

23
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,620
what I text is doing.

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,490
So that's our right aligned text

25
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,250
left aligned is obviously standard.

26
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,830
You can use text to line is left if you want to but it will be left by default anyway.

27
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,400
So a quick challenge for you can you create another paragraph tag with some scented text in it for it.

28
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,510
All right.

29
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,140
Have you managed it.

30
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:43,420
Let's have a class of scented and I'm going to spell it here.

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,980
Otherwise you get very confused because we have to use the correct or American spellings in our code.

32
00:02:50,200 --> 00:03:00,580
So that's have a sentence and then very simply as I hope you manage to figure out text align center

33
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,430
it is this text is sent.

34
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,630
Take a look.

35
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,710
There it is.

36
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:15,620
So the re-aligned is officially still right aligned and that is then centered.

37
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,390
OK so that's almost all we need to see but I'd like to show you justified as well.

38
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,630
Incidentally one of my favorite TV programs as well but not one of my favorite spacings I think it often

39
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,190
looks pretty odd on Web sites.

40
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,300
She have a really big chunk of text but that's obviously up to you as the web designer.

41
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,560
So to create justified

42
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,390
text we just use as you might imagine text a line is and then justify

43
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:05,100
now not to see the difference here we're probably going to need several copies of that sentence.

44
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,990
And let's make it a little bit taller as well.

45
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,450
Let's take a look.

46
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,210
There we go.

47
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,600
So you can see what's happened there is it stretched the text right to the edge of the page and it does

48
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,970
that by changing the letter and word spacing so sometimes that might make your text look a little bit

49
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,950
strange especially if you've got some long words.

50
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:32,080
So I'd use justified sparingly but if you want to use it that's how you do it.

51
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,490
All right.

52
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,180
So that's where we get to see ends of text alignment.

53
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,960
But at this point there is one more thing I want to show you when you're creating a website for a client.

54
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,410
Quite often they won't have given you the copy for the Web site yet and you'll need to put some web

55
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,790
site copy in there.

56
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,860
You don't generally want to put this text justified repeated lots and lots of times because it doesn't

57
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,660
look very natural and the client will be a bit confused.

58
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:58,870
So you may have seen something called lorem ipsum.

59
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,450
Now if you really want to know the facts behind Lorem Ipsden you can click that first link.

60
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:10,770
But I'm going to jump straight to the generator which is a really handy page for basically creating

61
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,070
a lot in text.

62
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,520
I have no idea what that means.

63
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,570
I don't really care.

64
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:22,510
But what I can do is then just take that text and copy it into my page there.

65
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,970
Let's get rid of the height so that it can change the height automatically and then have a look.

66
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,980
And now I've got a much more realistic idea of how that text is going to look regardless of what text

67
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,840
gets put in there eventually.

68
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,540
So Lorem Ipsum has become the Internet standard for generic text.

69
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,620
If you want to see what your web site's going to look like before you have the actual text.

70
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,110
This will give you a pretty good idea.

71
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,270
All right.

72
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,020
So we're nearly there.

73
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,980
Just one more video to go.

74
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,580
We're going to look at lynx in a little bit more detail.

75
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,200
And those pseudo classes that we saw very briefly in the previous video and then we're going to be on

76
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,280
our big CSSA challenge recreating the BBC News website.
