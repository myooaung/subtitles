1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,650
So this is the Wordpress dashboard and this is where you're going to be spending most of your time when

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,330
you're working with wordpress.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,430
In this video I'll give you a quick tour of the main parts of the dashboard and show you how to manage

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,200
and set up your site.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,540
You might be wondering at this point what your site actually looks like and we can see it by hovering

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,930
over example WordPress site and I'm just going to command click or control click on Windows visit site

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,300
to open it up in a new tab.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,640
So this is it.

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:35,130
So you can see we've got the site title there example WordPress site and we've got just another WordPress

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,500
site will see how to change that in a moment.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,730
And then our basic set up is quite bloke like.

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,080
So we've got our first blog post here which has been generated for us and then we've got a search button

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,740
and some recent posts down here on the site as well as look out side admen et cetera.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,900
So it doesn't look like much but don't worry we can change it into something beautiful very easily.

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,970
But before we worry about beauty Let's get the site working as we'd like.

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,050
So first off you can see this update option at the top there.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,040
You may or may not see that depending on what version you have got installed but it's definitely well

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,330
worth keeping your Wordpress up to date.

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:23,970
If you let it get out of date it'll get very vulnerable to hackers because Wordpress is so popular.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,860
Hackers target WordPress sites especially out-of-date ones.

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,900
Fortunately though you can update within WordPress you don't need to download the files and upload them

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,880
or anything like that.

23
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:43,200
It all happens within the system so you just have to click the button and then let the update happen.

24
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,030
There we go.

25
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,890
OK so back to the dashboard.

26
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm going to work our way down the menu on the left there.

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,970
So actually this home page you probably won't use a great deal with it does have some handy quick links

28
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:04,190
but I'm going to start by looking at posts so you'll only really be interested in posts if you are actually

29
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,080
making a blog.

30
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,940
But if you are.

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,280
This is where you'll write to your or your blog posts.

32
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:17,120
So if we click on the example one then that will take us to the edit screen where we can change the

33
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:23,840
post title and we can change the permalink as well we'll talk about that in a moment and we've got the

34
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:35,400
main content of our blog post here so we can just start typing something like that and we can use formatting

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,710
as well but because we're coders we're probably going to prefer the text version which allows us to

36
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,140
use DML to make our posts slick.

37
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,380
However we want from here while you're writing your post you can preview the changes and that will then

38
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,220
load up your changes without actually posting them on the site.

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,980
But when you're ready you can then update that post and then it will be live on your actual Web site.

40
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,390
Once you've done that one really handy feature of Wordpress is that you can go back to if you click

41
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:18,660
Browse next to revisions you can actually revert to a previous version if you want to get rid of those

42
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,650
changes.

43
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:30,940
You just go back and you can see the changes and restore the autosave and then update again and then

44
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,870
your changes will be undone.

45
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,470
So that's really handy if you want to go back and revert to an older version.

46
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:48,200
We can then choose a bunch of formatting options so we can have it as an image a video quite link a

47
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,010
gallery even audio and chat as well.

48
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,740
So you can experiment with very different post types but normally we're going to stick with the standard.

49
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,690
Next up is categories.

50
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:09,390
These are really useful ways to categorize your blog posts so you might have a funny category for example.

51
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,870
Or I don't know a world news category if you are doing a news website or something like that.

52
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,100
And then your users can view those specific categories very easily and search them as well.

53
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,480
I've used categories on several occasions when I'm not actually doing a blogsite.

54
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:32,240
For example if you were building a quiz website could use a WordPress plugin and then each post would

55
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,670
represent a quiz.

56
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,430
So don't be fooled into thinking that posts are exclusively for blogs.

57
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,070
You can use them to display any kind of content and then further down here we've got tags which are

58
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:49,700
much like category's but we can assign them more arbitrarily So if we're writing an article about coding

59
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,880
we might have page DML

60
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,160
javascript and fun as being Outbacks something like that and then once again the users can search within

61
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,420
the tax just like they can with categories.

62
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,370
But it's a bit less formal and we can assign them wherever we like.

63
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,290
Again you could use tag to have ways of categorize quid's questions your worksheets.

64
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,950
Whatever it was you wanted to share on your site.

65
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,190
Not necessarily just log posts.

66
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:25,680
And finally we can set a featured image there which is as simple as just uploading a file and then extracting

67
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,250
it from the media library.

68
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,660
Now I mentioned the permalink earlier.

69
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,880
So by default the pages look like this.

70
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,630
With a not particularly friendly looking you are well at the end there.

71
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:49,080
So if you click Change permalink then you can set them up to have a date or a month or have a numeric

72
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,360
look like that.

73
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,310
I normally go for the very simple post name and then that will just give you our help that looks like

74
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,690
that which is a bit friendlier and more sharable.

75
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,940
So let's save our permalink settings.

76
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,880
And then how just get back and refresh the page here and let's see what this link has changed you can

77
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,450
see it's a much nicer now.

78
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,790
Slash Hello world.

79
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,080
I could change that if I wanted if I didn't want the hyphen in there then I could just change that and

80
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,060
click OK and then update and that's all saved.

81
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,130
So that's how posts work.

82
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:38,510
We've looked at categories and tags as well although you can edit them directly on those pages.

83
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,890
You don't have to edit them within a post page.

84
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,540
Now media is much what we saw just now.

85
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,610
Normally I don't look at the media library specifically but when I want to add an item to a post I just

86
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,830
use the option right there.

87
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,520
So if we added again so if I want to add some media here I would just click Add media and that takes

88
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,260
me to the media library.

89
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,580
But if you want to specifically manage your media then you might want to do it

90
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,040
pages then are slightly different to posts.

91
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,490
They look very similar.

92
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,190
So we've got a sample page here.

93
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,260
And if we edit that you can see we've got some nice Stiefel content there.

94
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,410
And let's have a little look at our sample page as well.

95
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:36,770
So I just command clicks that I open it up in a new tab and you can see it looks like this pages are

96
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,580
different to posts because they're intended to store more permanent content.

97
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,380
So here is my quizz website example again you might use your pages to have a contact form and about

98
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:52,040
page or a list of all the quizzes that are available and then you might store the quizzes themselves

99
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,130
on posts.

100
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,590
So they are different in function without informe they're pretty similar.

101
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,510
And we can edit them in the same way set up a featured image although we don't generally assign them

102
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,990
to categories because they're more standalone.

103
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:15,160
All right then we've got comments which again may be useful for you if you're running a blog of some

104
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,510
sort but if you're not you may want to disable comments I'll show you how to do that in a moment but

105
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:30,370
here we've got our sample comments which we can either unapproved Reply-To or send to spam now the appearance

106
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,630
tap is where things get really interesting.

107
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:39,280
So I'm going to save themes for the next video but this is where we would add a new theme where we can

108
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:45,630
completely change the look of our site and also where we would customize what appears in various places.

109
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,580
That's a pretty meaty topic in itself though.

110
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,170
So we're going to do that separately in the next video.

111
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,690
Plugins we'll have a quick look at what plugins are installed by default.

112
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:03,670
Most of these you won't be using directly but they are working in the background but WordPress has a

113
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,180
huge community that are building plugins.

114
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:16,770
And if we do a quick search for Wordpress plugins find 43000 plugins are available.

115
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,960
So we've got beby press forum software caching software that speeds up your site but the press turns

116
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,180
your site into a social network themed check to make sure your theme is working correctly.

117
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,420
And there's a lot more in there.

118
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,930
Almost anything you could want to do with a Web site.

119
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,390
You can probably find a WordPress plugin that does it.

120
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,340
The plugin ecosystem is one of the best reasons to develop with Wordpress and really can save a huge

121
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:45,360
amount of time when creating things like contact forms logging systems or social features.

122
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,920
Speaking of which we can add users to our sites as well.

123
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,090
So most sites you probably won't want to have users but you might want to have for example a single

124
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:03,310
admin who maybe you was able to manage the site and then your client might want to be a member of the

125
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,830
site as well.

126
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,290
Just put an example usernames

127
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:18,260
in there and then they can be a number of different roles so they can be a subscriber a contributor

128
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,410
author editor or administrator.

129
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,710
With most clients you'd probably want to make them an editor which means that they could edit the site

130
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,040
themselves without having access to advanced features with which they might break the site.

131
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,470
Again one of the best features of Wordpress is that clients are able to update the content without actually

132
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,360
having to know any code at all.

133
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,910
So that's generally how you use users.

134
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,280
But as I say you can you WordPress to create log in web sites as well which means that breaches like

135
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:56,630
password resets and secure logging systems are set up for you by default moving swiftly on tools.

136
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,520
We're going to jump over because there's nothing particularly useful for us there.

137
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:06,290
But settings it is worth whenever you set up a new WordPress site to just quickly go through the settings.

138
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,640
It will start at Gen..

139
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,550
This is where the tagline just another WordPress site is put.

140
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,540
So you'll probably want to change that to something which explains what your web site does a little

141
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,680
bit.

142
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,690
This is out WordPress you are el and the moment registration is switched off.

143
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,460
We might want to switch that up to allow people to register and comment.

144
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:38,300
But we could also allow people to even be an editor or an administrator when they sign up chinked the

145
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:45,340
time zone date format and a bunch of other stuff that we're probably not that interested in the writing

146
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,320
settings.

I don't normally go in and edit these very much but you can actually post via email if you want to but

148
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,070
we'll jump over that and go to read.

149
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,430
Well there's one important setting and that's what you want your front page to display.

150
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:05,710
So by default it displays your latest posts but you might well want to have a static front page and

151
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,270
then we can set that to our sample page if you want.

152
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:19,240
And then that will mean that your home page is no longer a list of posts but some content instead.

153
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,580
So if you're not creating a blog then that's going to be likely the way that you want to set things

154
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:23,990
up.

155
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,650
OK.

156
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,070
So that's pretty much all you need to know about WordPress as a web developer though most of your work

157
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:35,310
is going to be in changing the appearance of the site.

158
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:41,210
So you want to set up firstly a good looking site but also one that has the functionality that you or

159
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:45,330
your client want and has all the links and the options in the right places.

160
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,250
So we do most of that with working with themes and that'll be the topic of our next video.
