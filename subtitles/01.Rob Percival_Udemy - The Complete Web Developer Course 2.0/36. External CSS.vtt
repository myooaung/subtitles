00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.340
Now just when you thought you had done with CSSA there's one more thing I want to show you.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.010
I've hinted at this a couple of times during this section but another way of storing your SS is to do

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.100
it completely off the page that you're working on.

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.270
So the internal CSSA that we've been using so far has all of the CSSA we're right there in the code

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.470
of the page.

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.070
That's a couple of reasons why that's not a great idea.

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.660
It's very helpful in development when you're making a site because everything's together but in production

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.350
it means that you have to have your CSSA content on every page which isn't great.

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.510
You could find yourself updating it several times and you'll definitely have a slightly slower site

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.700
because the users will have to download the CSSA information every time they load a new page.

11
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.700
So the general solution for this is external CSSA and we already saw one of those files when we used

12
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.860
a Google font.

13
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.740
But I'm going to show you how to do it now with our BBC dot HTML file.

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.530
So I'm going to get all of the style information

15
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.690
and cut it and we'll get rid of this and just out of interest as have a quick look and see what our

16
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.560
page looks like without any sense at all.

17
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.090
It's not great readable but not great.

18
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.510
So how do we keep our CSA as separate from how aged him.

19
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.510
Well I'm going to do it by creating a new file in brackets.

20
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.110
And this is going to be our CSSA file.

21
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:50.060
So I'm going to call it BBC CSSA and that's where I'll store all of our styles.

22
00:01:51.020 --> 00:02:00.940
And now all I need to do is reference that file in my BBC HTL metafile will bring in all those CSSA

23
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.960
styles.

24
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.520
So you may remember some of the code that we had when we copy it in the Google font link but we do this

25
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:18.810
using link which is our way of bringing in a file into our HVM file and we use rail which is short for

26
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.980
relation.

27
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.920
And this is the relation between the main aged him l file and the file that we are linking to.

28
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.160
And in this case it's a stylesheet.

29
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.070
So this tells the H-G e-mail that we're linking to a separate style sheet.

30
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.090
Then we have to clarify the type and the standard for style sheets is text slash CSSA.

31
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:49.490
And finally we give it the ref with the hypertext reference the location that's going to be BBC C-s

32
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.110
us.

33
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.260
Simple as that.

34
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.490
So after we save that and reload our page we've got all our styles back in.

35
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.660
So that's how you use external CSSA.

36
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.840
And I would recommend using a Celsius that's pretty much all the time when you're working with a live

37
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.660
site.

38
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.440
It just makes things so much easier.

39
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.240
Separates everything out and requires the user to download less information when they visit multiple

40
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.840
pages on your site.

41
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.240
All right so use some external style sheets in the next Web site that you create.

42
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.930
But for now we're going to go on and look at some javascript.
