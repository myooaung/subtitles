1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,840
So now we've seen how to create unordered lists using ul to create a list and then apply to create individual

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,760
list items.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,240
Can you guess how we might create an ordered list.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:11,990
Have a go.

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,640
I hope you guessed right.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:23,940
All we do is change ul to oh well for ordered list and the same in the closing tag there.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,280
And then if we take a look at that it's exactly the same except we've got numbers instead of bullet

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,410
points so it's ordered and we can have a little bit of fun with ordered lists and we can mess things

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,630
around a little bit.

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,260
So say for example for some reason I wanted to start my list at the number 10 rather than the number

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:52,560
one I can use an extra attribute as it's known in my old tag to set the start value.

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:01,250
So I just use start and then equals and then usually in quotes will put the number that we want to start

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,640
at.

14
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:10,640
So I want to start at 10 for example or just start equals 10 and a bit like the you tag the underline

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,350
start was actually deprecated in HD M-L 4.0 1 but it's back in 1985 and it's supported by every major

16
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,760
browser out there so you can use it quite safely.

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,000
We can also do a couple of other fun things.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,170
We can use reversed in there and that will do what you might guess.

19
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,590
Four three two one.

20
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,080
So that does everything in the opposite order.

21
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,690
And finally we can specify the type of ordered list that we want.

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:46,510
And there's a few type options and you can see my text editor here is very nicely giving me the options

23
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,590
so I can use instead of one to three which is what I've got at the moment.

24
00:01:50,740 --> 00:02:00,610
I could use type is equal to A and that will then if I save it give me ABC as look at the other type

25
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,360
options.

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:14,350
So we've got capital there which gives me capital Roman numerals as small II as well which gives a small

27
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,280
Roman numerals.

28
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:21,870
And finally we've got small AI which gives us a BCT.

29
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,140
So a lot of people don't actually know that you can change the type of an order list but you can very

30
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,340
easily.

31
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,820
All right.

32
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,310
So you need to know about lists for now and the next video will go on and see how we add images to our

33
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,260
web pages.
