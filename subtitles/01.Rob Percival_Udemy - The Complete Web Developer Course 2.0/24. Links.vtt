00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.960
All right so let's get rid of our lovely table code there and see how we can link from one page to another.

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.770
We've all spent plenty of time clicking on links I'm sure.

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.120
And they're actually really easy to introduce into your pages.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:21.140
So let's put our link inside a paragraph tag and the tag that we use for links is the tag.

5
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.100
I believe that stands for anchor.

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.090
We'll see specifically what an anchor link is in a few minutes time.

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.890
But first I want to show you how we can link to for example the Google home page.

8
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.050
So the a gem really just has the one attribute and that's a ref.

9
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.910
So that should for hyperlink reference.

10
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.080
And that is the you are l that we want to link to.

11
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.320
So before you Arel of Google is HTP colon slash slash WWE.

12
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.400
Google dot com.

13
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.240
There we go.

14
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:06.030
And then inside the e-TAG you put whatever text you want to use for the link.

15
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.670
So click here to go to Google dot com or something like that.

16
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.550
So we click there to go to Google and then we click there.

17
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.590
That takes us to the Google home page simple.

18
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.790
Now you can actually put anything you like in this tag here.

19
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.200
So here's a quick challenge for you.

20
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.040
Can you put an image inside a link and then pick it so that when you click on the image it goes to a

21
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.110
Web site of your choice say Wikipedia and you can use the same image that we used a couple of years

22
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.540
ago.

23
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.640
If you like.

24
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.130
Go for it.

25
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.590
All right.

26
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.340
I manage that

27
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.340
the way we do it is we set up the link and exactly the same way.

28
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.560
So we're going into Wikipedia this time.

29
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.020
So it's at Wikipedia dot com.

30
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.140
And then inside the tag for link we put out image tag.

31
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:23.880
So if you remember that I am g and then source C equals and then my one was homotopic N-G.

32
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.790
There we go.

33
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.920
Simple as that.

34
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.630
So let's have a look.

35
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.420
So we've now got our first link is still there and there's a lovely home image.

36
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.200
Then click on that takes us to Wikipedia order.

37
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.870
Let's just update that.

38
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.370
You can say directed nicely but always good to get the link right in the first place.

39
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.980
All right so that's how we do links to pages on other Web sites.

40
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.970
We can also do links within our Web site and they work slightly differently.

41
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.960
These are known as absolute links because no matter where you are on the web any link that goes to HTP

42
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.060
Kelen Slash has to be read every day.

43
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.340
Google dot com will go to the same place but there are things called relative links which we'll see

44
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.610
now and they can be a little bit easier if you're linking within your website.

45
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.460
So they work in exactly the same way.

46
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.320
But this time I'm going to link to Hello World.

47
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.890
I actually L which was our first page that we came up with.

48
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.490
And you can see this time.

49
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.860
I don't need to put HTP at that.

50
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:41.580
I just put hello world or h t m l because hello world is in the same folder and location as the page

51
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.380
that we were in at the moment.

52
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.580
So if we have a quick look in the Finder you can see Hello world is there and my web page is there.

53
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.930
So if they're in the same place you can just put a link to them.

54
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.760
Without having to put all the other stuff.

55
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.600
Right.

56
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.310
And that's really useful because you might move your site to a different domain name some reason or

57
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.570
you might restructure your site.

58
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.120
Things are in a slightly different place to where they were before.

59
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.100
And if you do that using relative links it should not break anything.

60
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.900
So I'd recommend using relative links on your own site and then absolute links if you're linking to

61
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.630
someone else's site.

62
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.510
So let's just check this one out.

63
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.460
There we go.

64
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.330
Well I.

65
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.710
And then you can see it links nicely to what I changed to Halo Rob earlier.

66
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.970
All right.

67
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.810
The last thing I want to show you about links what I mentioned at the beginning.

68
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.300
The uncle links linking within a page.

69
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.820
Now to make that clear I'm going to bring in several.

70
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.270
To get my page.

71
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.180
A lot of content.

72
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.070
So let's just have a look.

73
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.820
Eric so we can scroll up and down all those homers now.

74
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.340
And one thing that's very useful when you've got a nice long page like this is a link at the bottom

75
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.470
that says Back to Top you've probably seen those on a few sites and they're really easy to create with

76
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.540
HTL.

77
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.900
And we do this using what's known as an I.D. So I'm going to take my paragraph tag which begins the

78
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.220
page and I'm going to give it an ID.

79
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.660
And for now I would just give it an ID of top like that.

80
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.890
The idea is we're actually going to be using a lot first in CSSA for styling.

81
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.120
And then in javascript to start getting bits of your web page interacting with each other.

82
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.290
But for now we'll just use them for this anchoring effect.

83
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:47.430
So now that we've got a paragraph tag with an ID we can add a link at the end of our page and we use

84
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:54.240
the hash symbol which on a Mac is all three.

85
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.900
It'll be somewhere else on a PC keyboard probably depending where you are in the world.

86
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:09.010
And then after the hash symbol we just use whatever word we use to describe our I.D. in this case top.

87
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.580
There we go.

88
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.830
And then we just put in the text that we want to use for that link.

89
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.770
And let's take a look.

90
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.010
So now we scroll down and back it up.

91
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.730
And that takes us right to the top of the page.

92
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.180
Let's say for example that we wanted to jump to the third Homer.

93
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.720
So one two three.

94
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:37.450
Can you add in a link just underneath back to top to jump to the third Hona on the page.

95
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:43.680
Go for it.

96
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:44.170
All right.

97
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.670
Have you managed that.

98
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.470
It's obviously pretty similar to our back to top.

99
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.110
Would just add in and I stress again with a hash symbol.

100
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.710
And then I'll call it third Homa like that and then

101
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.990
whatever text you want to go to the third Homer and then one two three.

102
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.360
The third homers here.

103
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:17.880
So let's give that paragraph tag an ID of that Homer and we go let's have a look.

104
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:24.090
So go to Homer then jumped not to the top but to our third Homer.

105
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.580
Fantastic.

106
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.190
So we got three types of links there.

107
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.580
We've got the absolute links which take you to a specific page on the web.

108
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.930
We've got the relative links which take you to a page on your website and then we've got these anchor

109
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:42.110
links which take you to a different portion of the page that you're currently on.

110
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:42.570
Brilliant.

111
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.520
So we're almost at the end of this first HVM L section.

112
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.220
Got a big challenge coming up for you.

113
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.600
Now there's one more thing I want to show you and that is TNL entities and we'll look at that in the

114
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.300
next video.
