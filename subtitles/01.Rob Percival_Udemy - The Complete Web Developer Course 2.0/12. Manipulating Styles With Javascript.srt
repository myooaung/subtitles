1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,020
Or I just need to look at a couple of things before we can do our disappearing circles challenge and

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,390
that is how we can manipulate styles with Javascript.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:14,870
So far we've been manipulating content mostly by changing this in HCM L. var..

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,380
But we can do the same with styles.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,150
So let's add a paragraph.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,760
Call it more text and we'll have the very boring.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,150
This is some text.

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,980
So that's not going to be styled at all.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,360
Let's create a button with an ID of style text

10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,830
and we'll have the text style text on it.

11
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,910
Obviously it doesn't do anything yet.

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,460
But now let's add some code for that button.

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:07,080
And just the same way document or get element by id and the element that we want to get is the style

14
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,600
text button.

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,410
And then we want to add an on click function to that.

16
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,520
So this is going to be a function with Kelly brackets.

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,830
And then what we want to do is just add some style to the more text paragraph.

18
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:35,880
So for example when want go through the process get element by id and then we want to get this time

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:44,210
is more text and then instead of in a HMO we do style.

20
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:53,740
And then for example if we want to change the color to red we would have dot style color equals.

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,570
And then in quites read simple as that.

22
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,300
Now let's have a look.

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,450
Style text.

24
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,870
It goes red.

25
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,950
Fantastic.

26
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,690
Changing the font size is very similar but slightly trickier because it's not exactly the same.

27
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:21,150
We don't use font size because we don't like that hyphen in the javascript we just use font size instead.

28
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:28,880
So that's using the capitalization similar to get element by id small f but then capital S and let's

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,080
say we want to make it a font size of 50 pixels that's how I look.

30
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:44,010
And again it's massive and so feel free to play around with that but obviously combine several styles

31
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,830
if you want but just having multiple commands like this.

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,360
But the particular other one I want to show you which we're going to be using in our disappearing circles

33
00:02:51,690 --> 00:03:03,400
challenge is to make it disappear and we can do that by setting the display property to none.

34
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:10,150
So as you can imagine that just sets the CSSA display property to none which effectively makes it disappear.

35
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,110
Let's check it out.

36
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,710
There we go.

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,710
It's gone.

38
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,180
It's not even just disappeared.

39
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,430
But it's actually been removed from the flow of the page.

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,600
And so the button moves up as a result.

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,360
So feel free to get creative and play around to see what styles you can affect with Javascript.

42
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,610
But we're going to go on now to our mini challenge disappearing circles.
