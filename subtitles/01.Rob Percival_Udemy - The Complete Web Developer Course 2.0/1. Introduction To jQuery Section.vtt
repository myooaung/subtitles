00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.550
Congratulations on making it to Section 5 of the complete web developer course in the previous section

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.490
we went through all the basics of Javascript.

3
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.850
So we looked at things like variables and arrays loops and if statements and we saw how we could put

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.450
all of that together to make a functional and interactive Web site.

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.690
I hope you enjoy that because there's more of that coming up in this section where we'll be looking

6
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.870
at Jay Querrey which is a javascript framework which makes working with javascript a lot more fun and

7
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.080
a lot more powerful.

8
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.860
You'll learn how to make even more powerful web sites and web apps.

9
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.150
And at the end of the section we'll be making our biggest project yet which will be an interactive HVM

10
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.400
LCS SS and Javascript processor called Code player.

11
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.280
Now that you've learned.

12
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.040
H d m l c s s and Javascript.

13
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.920
You're in a great position to build real functional good looking Web sites.

14
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.900
So if you want to you can start bidding for projects on freelance Web sites or making web sites for

15
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.470
friends and family or even approaching your boss and suggesting a website project.

16
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.300
As I've said there's no better way to learn to code and to build real websites especially ones that

17
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.620
are going to be used by real people.

18
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.070
So have an idea put it into practice and then tweet me at Tech.

19
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.570
Rob I'd love to see what you make and I'll send it on to the world.

20
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.070
Enjoy the section and I hope you like me will fall in love with Jay Querrey.

21
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.400
I'll see you as always at the beginning of the next one.
