00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.590
So now that you're familiar with applying stylings to classes and ideas we're going to apply those styles

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:14.500
to a group of HCM elements and the usual way to do that is to split them up inside divs.

3
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.800
So a div is just short for division and let's say for some reason I wanted to

4
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:33.720
take those first two paragraph tags and split them into a separate div to the rest and get my indenting

5
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.760
nice.

6
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.910
There we go.

7
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.340
For now I'm going to take away my classes

8
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.710
for those as well.

9
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.160
So you can see in itself the div doesn't do anything.

10
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:56.460
It doesn't apply any classes or make it look any different but if I apply I class to that div I might

11
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.960
want to give it a class of first section and then I've used a dash there not a space should never use

12
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.140
spaces in your class or id names.

13
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.600
And in fact I think I'll make that an ID because there's only going to be one first section that makes

14
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.430
more sense to give it an id rather than a class.

15
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.590
So then I might want all the text in that first section to be blue.

16
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.370
So can you apply that for me make all the text in the first section div blue with just a single CSSA

17
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.200
command.

18
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.900
Go for it.

19
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.020
All right I hope you manage that.

20
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.810
It's an idea.

21
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:49.490
So we're going to use hash and then first section and we add in our Kelli brackets and then if we want

22
00:01:49.490 --> 00:02:00.110
everything to be blue we just use color code on really we get and then will style everything inside

23
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.180
the first section div as Billy.

24
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:11.190
So that's one way of using divs to style the contents but we can also buy the style to the div itself.

25
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.060
So let's say we wanted a pink background for some reason in this first section then we could set the

26
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.190
background color to Big

27
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.520
every day and then you can see now we've got a really separate section to the rest of the page and you

28
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.940
can also then see the limits of what the day is.

29
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.600
So the Dave is that box because all the way across the page and contains those two paragraphs we might

30
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.250
want to also change the width of this div.

31
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.460
So rather than go all the way across the page we might want to go halfway across the page and we do

32
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:59.500
that just using width and 50 percent that would take it half way across the page.

33
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.300
There we go.

34
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.520
We could also set the width to a certain number of pixels.

35
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:13.020
So if we made it a hundred pixels for example X then that would mean that the text would start to go

36
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.220
onto multiple lines and that's more or less all there is to it.

37
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.220
We can use divs to apply styles to the contents of the div but also to the div itself like the background

38
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.090
color.

39
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.910
So a very quick challenge for you Can you put a div around the SEC.

40
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.870
The third paragraph tag and the H-1 and then give them both a yellow background.

41
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.520
Go for it.

42
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.360
All right.

43
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.070
That way.

44
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:50.470
Well should've just been something like div and then you could have done it with a class or an ID.

45
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.690
I'm going to give it that ID of a second section that seems to make sense.

46
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:06.200
And then I'll close my div after the H one and I hope you did your indenting all nicely.

47
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.270
And that's all we need in terms of h t m l.

48
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.320
So I apply that to apply the background.

49
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.950
We just use the hash.

50
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:24.790
And then second section to select that div and then we want a background color

51
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.460
of yellow.

52
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.760
There we go.

53
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.970
So we're still a fairly long way from beautiful Web sites but we're coming on quickly in our ability

54
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:49.510
to ply a range of styles to different objects in groups and with classes and ideas.

55
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.340
So this is all making sense so far.

56
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.700
We're now going to look at specific stylings how you achieve certain effects and we're going to start

57
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.940
next video looking in more detail at color.
