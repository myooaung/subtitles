1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,370
So now we're going to move on from our What's the weather app and we're going to look at a new and hugely

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,080
important and powerful API the Google Maps API.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,300
You're almost certainly familiar with google maps.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:17,280
It's a great way to navigate from place to place and it's a really excellent way to put maps into your

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,410
web sites and your apps.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,440
So take a moment to navigate to cloud dot Google dot com slash maps hyphen platform and if you want

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,080
to have a quick scan of what's available on the Google Maps API essentially you can do anything that

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,170
you might want to do with maps including working with navigation and finding specific places like restaurants

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,870
parks et cetera within your website might be worth quickly checking the pricing page.

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,070
You get a lot on the free tier and definitely as you're just developing it's very unlikely you'll end

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,230
up paying for anything.

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,910
But always bear in mind that if your website does start getting popular you'll likely start having to

13
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,570
pay for your Google Maps API usage.

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:01,720
OK.

15
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,990
In this video we're just going to look at a few of the basic features of the Google Maps API how to

16
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:13,860
get started how to display a simple map on your website how to style that map how to add places onto

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,280
the map.

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,170
And finally how to add the user's location onto the map.

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,910
So to get started we tap the get started button and then pick which IPs we want to kick off with we'll

20
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,960
go for just maps for now the routes and places work in a very similar way so you'll be able to extend

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,750
the code that we cover in this lecture to those pretty easily and then continue.

22
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,950
And then we need a project to be working with.

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:48,100
If you've already got a project on the Google platform you can use that or we can create a new one or

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,410
just call it test maps project.

25
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,440
You can call it whatever you like and then click next and then we'll need to set up billing.

26
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,540
You probably already have a credit card connected to your Google account.

27
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,490
But if you don't you'll need to add one here.

28
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,360
I've got just one billing account at it so I'm going to use that one.

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,280
If you don't have one you'll be prompted to add credit card details and do be aware that you will start

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,200
to get charged.

31
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,500
If your maps account goes over the for usage limit OK.

32
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:31,890
Next again and it will now set up the Google Maps API is on your account and give you a API key which

33
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:38,730
you can use to refer to yourself in your scripts.

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,360
There we go.

35
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,530
So I'm going to copy that to the clipboard and then click done.

36
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:52,820
One thing just to point out before we go on and use the key to build a real maps based Web site is it

37
00:02:52,830 --> 00:03:00,880
is definitely worth securing your key and clarifying.

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,560
So if it's only going to be used on one particular Web site what that Web site is going to be to prevent

39
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,420
other people from using Yochi without your permission.

40
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,030
But we'll leave that for now.

41
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,360
We're going to jump back to where we started.

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,170
That is cloud dot dot com slash maps and platform.

43
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,290
And then we're going to move on to the documentation.

44
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,790
That's where all the documentation is stored.

45
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,250
And by the way if you can't find that link if it's moved around on the Web site you can go straight

46
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,980
to developers dot Google dot com slash maps slash documentation.

47
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,050
OK.

48
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,330
And then we scroll down to see that there are various ways that you can access the API.

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,760
If you're working on apps for example but we want to work through the web so we can choose the javascript

50
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,630
API.

51
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,280
And again if you can't find that link you might just want to go straight to develop a legal com slash

52
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,570
Matt slash documentation's left javascript slash tutorial and then very conveniently we've got a great

53
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:04,380
Hello World page DML page here which I'm going to copy and paste into my text and get it working and

54
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,320
then we'll have a look through and see what this code is doing.

55
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:17,830
So I'm going to head over to my finder I've got a test HDMI DML blank document set up on my desktop

56
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:27,640
I'm going to open that up with brackets and I'm going to paste the code of the sample page in and then

57
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:33,920
the one change we need to make is we need to replace your API key here with our API key.

58
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:46,530
So go back over to my Google Cloud Platform console and copy that and then paste it in right there and

59
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,310
that's it.

60
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,580
Let's have a quick look and make sure it works.

61
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,700
So I'm just going to save that file back I have to find and then open it up.

62
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,870
In crime and that we get.

63
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:06,930
So we have our very own web page with our map up on running and you can say it's got all the basic features

64
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
of Google Maps you can switch to satellite view.

65
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,950
Zoom in and out even drag a little man in for street view if you like.

66
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,550
So that's already a very powerful thing to be able to do.

67
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,640
Let's have a quick look at the code and see how it's doing it.

68
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,220
So it's pretty straightforward.

69
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,340
All are basic elements of an aged DML page here a little bit of styling to make it a full page map.

70
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,810
And then we've got an empty div with an ID of map which is obviously where our map is going to be contained.

71
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:46,120
And then a bit of Javascript here which creates the map so it creates a variable called Map and then

72
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,970
it creates a function called it map which initializes the map using various settings.

73
00:05:52,270 --> 00:06:00,560
So you can see it takes the variable map here and turns it into a new Google Maps map based on the div

74
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,820
with an ID of map which is this one here and then it adds a couple of settings.

75
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:13,120
So the center gives a certain latitude and longitude and gives a certain zoom level as well.

76
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,320
So let's see what happens if we have the zoom level to say 15 and then refresh the page you can see

77
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,590
with far more zoomed in.

78
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,720
So here's a quick challenge for you.

79
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,540
Can you change this code so it shows us a map of London which is reasonably zoomed out so that we can

80
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,180
see the whole of London.

81
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,600
Good luck.

82
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,800
Go for it.

83
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,380
Did you manage it.

84
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,410
It's simply a matter of knowing the latitude and longitude of London.

85
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,220
Which Google of course can tell us latitude and longitude of London.

86
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,950
There we go.

87
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,800
So the latitude is fifty one point five.

88
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,040
Let's put that in them.

89
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,450
And the long achieved.

90
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,390
Zero Point 1 2 7 8.

91
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,740
We probably don't need to be that accurate but that will work.

92
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,660
And then let's guess the zeem level.

93
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:19,130
I'm going to be slightly more zoomed in than we started with see if Hazim level of 9 looks about right.

94
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,470
And there we go.

95
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,490
That's pretty good.

96
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,540
You might want to zoom in a little bit more.

97
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,280
Just so that we only have London.

98
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,210
But I think that's pretty close to what we were looking for.

99
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:31,750
Great.

100
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:39,730
Just one final note in the code is that of course we have this script down here which is what is doing

101
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,440
the magic.

102
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:47,590
So this is calling Google Maps API javascript and essentially telling it to run the map function which

103
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,350
is what we defined here.

104
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,910
So really that's the basics of adding maps to your app of course they don't need to be fullscreen.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,660
We can make them

106
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:58,940
say

107
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:09,740
200 pixels square just like any other div and that will then appear as part of your website rather than

108
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,350
the whole thing.

109
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,770
But for now let's leave it as full screen.

110
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,090
OK so now we'll just jump back over to the documentation and just see a couple of other things that

111
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,650
we can do so quickly here.

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,680
We'll see how to add a marker onto our map which is something common you might want to do if you're

113
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:34,760
writing a contact us page for example and you want to show where a business is on the map.

114
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,010
You can do that very easily.

115
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,450
So again let's take the carried him

116
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:55,810
and I'm going to just replace everything which means I'll have to copy my key again and pop it back

117
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,030
in

118
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,070
so again let's have a look.

119
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,140
Just make sure that works.

120
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,230
And then we'll take a moment to look at the code see what it's doing.

121
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,790
There we go.

122
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,660
So we've got a marker at a place called I think I'm even going to try to pronounce that.

123
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,740
But at that place there

124
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,370
and this is created again we've got the same set up as before with an in it map function then.

125
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,310
But this time we're using some different settings to add our marker.

126
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:33,560
So we've got a variable called louer with a certain latitude and longitude.

127
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,500
And then we create our map and you can see here we are creating a new marker at that location.

128
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,650
So another quick challenge for you.

129
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,460
Can you create a map with a marker on Niagara Falls.

130
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,720
Simple as that.

131
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,370
Go for it.

132
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,250
All right.

133
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,490
Have you managed it.

134
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,090
Again it's just a matter

135
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:12,000
of getting the location at the latitude and longitude of the place where you want to Adam AKA

136
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,190
and adding it in there.

137
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,180
And in fact that should be enough.

138
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,150
Let's have a look.

139
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,180
And something has gone horribly wrong there.

140
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,570
Hopefully some of you have got this problem.

141
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,630
And so how to fix it this time instead of east.

142
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:51,830
You can see we've got 79 degrees west and we put that into our web site using minus 79 nine 0 8 4 9.

143
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:58,820
So if you see South there on the latitude then you'll need to add a minus in there as well.

144
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,200
OK.

145
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,580
Try that again.

146
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,190
And there we go.

147
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,700
So that is now centered nicely on Niagara Falls.

148
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,400
Of course to make your

149
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:21,270
carried make sense I renamed that variable Niagara.

150
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:28,650
When you come back to it you're not completely confused as to why you've called Niagara leur.

151
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,070
All right.

152
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,960
So we're nearly there.

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,350
The last thing we're going to do is see how to style your map.

154
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,700
So on the left there we've got a link again if the links in a different place you might just want to

155
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,390
get straight to the aerial which is that one there.

156
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,110
Styling maps is pretty easy.

157
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:55,170
And as before we'll take the code Copia run it and then have a look to see what it's doing.

158
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,210
And because I've replaced the API key need to put that back in again.

159
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,880
OK let's have a look.

160
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,900
And there we go.

161
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:19,720
So I've got a nice night made map of New York City the let's have a little work.

162
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,450
So once again we're using the function and it map to create our map.

163
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,480
This time we've got a center somewhere in New York City and a zoom level.

164
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:34,510
And this time we have a Stiles object and all its doing is adding styles to various elements so you

165
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:41,770
can see we've got some geometry here with a certain color labels text and labels text fill again with

166
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,520
certain colors and you can add any settings you want.

167
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,360
We've got points of interest there.

168
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,380
Parks roads highways et cetera et cetera.

169
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,860
So you get the idea.

170
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:59,360
You can customize the display of pretty much anything on the map and just one more thing.

171
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:05,170
The Google Maps API also makes it very easy to get the user's location which can be extremely useful

172
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,160
if you want to create a web site that shows them places near them for example.

173
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,590
So let's see how we do that.

174
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,690
You can see an option here called geo location so I click on that option.

175
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,730
Geo location is essentially working out the location of your users.

176
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,200
So let's see how it's done just as we've done before.

177
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,970
Take the sample code

178
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:44,450
copy it into your site and then replace your API key with your API key

179
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,940
Okay.

180
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,660
And let's take a look.

181
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,730
We refresh that now and now you'll see that we're asked whether we want to allow this Web site to view

182
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:03,860
our location say click allow and then it should jump over to your location with a little box there.

183
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,350
You'll notice that it's not super accurate depending on the device that you're on.

184
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,850
I'm actually in Cambridge over here so it's not super close.

185
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,440
If you're on a phone you should use the GPS.

186
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,890
So give you a more accurate location but if you're just on Wi-Fi it won't be particularly accurate.

187
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:23,030
Let's just have a quick look and see how it's doing that.

188
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,180
So it's a little bit more complicated this time.

189
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,410
But again we're creating the map using the map method.

190
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:35,350
And you can see this time we've got an info window which is this little box here.

191
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:42,760
And you can see what it's doing is attempting to get the location and when it does that if it's successful

192
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:48,070
you've given it permission and the browser gives your location to the script then it processes that

193
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,950
gets the latitude and longitude sets the position for the info window.

194
00:14:53,370 --> 00:15:00,460
So that's a bit of content and puts the info window on the map and that it also sets the center of the

195
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:00,940
map.

196
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,390
That's if it's successful if it's not then it shows an appropriate error message.

197
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,190
And that's process down here in this handle location error function.

198
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,490
It gives the user an appropriate error.

199
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,390
So there we go.

200
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,420
That's how you get the users location and show it on a map using the Google Maps API.

201
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,160
All right.

202
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,620
So there's obviously a huge amount more you can do with the Google Maps API.

203
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:29,080
This is just a way to get you started and to see how useful the Google documentation is and how easy

204
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,040
it is to create your own maps from it.

205
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,840
So have a think about how you might add some maps to a Web site you're working on.

206
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,520
And when you've done that come back and I'll see you in the next video.
