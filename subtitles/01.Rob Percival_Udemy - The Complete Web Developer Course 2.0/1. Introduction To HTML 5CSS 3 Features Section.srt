Welcome to Section 12 of the complete web developer course I hope you enjoyed the previous app making

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:14,060
section and are already thinking of an app that you can build and put into Google Play and the App Store.

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:22,600
In this section we'll be looking at the latest versions of HVM L and C S S that is HDMI 5 and CSSA 3.

4
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:28,540
Both of them are big updates to their respective language and allow us to do a lot more powerful things

5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,850
and we could before.

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,890
With HD in 0 5 we'll be seeing how we can integrate audio and video into our apps as well as make our

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,150
forms a lot more powerful and user friendly.

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:45,690
We'll even see how the canvas tag works and how we can use it to start drawing directly onto our HD

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,440
M-L page and even create real HMO based games.

10
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:58,200
With CSSA three We'll see how to do things like introduce gradients and make our webapps interactive

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,190
using animation.

12
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,790
There's a lot of powerful stuff here.

13
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,310
So I hope you're looking forward to it and I'll see you as always at the beginning of the next section.
