00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.090
Just before we move on to see SS I'd like to take a couple of videos to show you how to set up the web

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.800
hosting that comes with the Course now is a good time to do this because you've just completed your

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.210
first ever web page.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.410
And I'm sure you're itching to share it with the world and the web hosting is the ideal way to do this.

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.340
I'm assuming that you follow these steps in the how to get the free stuff and have an eco web hosting

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.980
account.

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.550
If you haven't then jump back to that video and follow the instructions there.

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.180
If you have then go to either web hosting daquiri UK slash slash Slash'em I should also say that if

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.440
you want to work with a different web host or you don't want web hosting at all then feel free to miss

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.660
out the next couple of videos.

11
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.230
But if you're not sure then stick with me because the web hosting adds a huge amount of power to what

12
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.900
you can do with the course.

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.040
So this is your customer area a cooperating Dockerty UK CCP slash home here.

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.840
You can create a hosting package which is what we're going to do next.

15
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.070
Or you can register a domain name.

16
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.750
You don't need to do that but if you want to be able to use your own domain name such as Robert Percival

17
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.980
Dakoda UK then you will need to purchase the domain name itself.

18
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.890
You're very welcome to do that with another company as well.

19
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.680
Feel free to compare prices and go with the cheapest one.

20
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.830
We've got some other options down here but for now we're not going to investigate any of those.

21
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.060
We're going to go straight to creating a hosting package so a hosting package is a place to store everything

22
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.340
to do with your web site you can upload files to it.

23
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.920
You can create databases as we'll see later on in the course and you can even create email addresses

24
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.570
and manage your email through the hosting package.

25
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.660
So all you have to enter here is a domain name and I'm going to put in Rob Percival's test hosting package

26
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.460
dot com.

27
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.900
You can select the hosting package type that you need.

28
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.090
I would go for the advanced unlimited because that offers you the most features and bear in mind that

29
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.470
you'll want to create a domain name that no one else has chosen before.

30
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.190
So if you try and put Google dot com in there it probably won't work because they'll already be a domain

31
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.310
on our system called Google dot com.

32
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.710
If you're really having problems finding a domain name that's not already taken.

33
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.280
Just put some numbers on the end like that.

34
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.660
OK so then click Create hosting package and in the background.

35
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.490
And through everything that needs to be set up for that hosting package and they would go.

36
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.820
So that's all been set up.

37
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.300
You'll receive an email with all the details for the package.

38
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.130
But the easiest way to log in is go down to manage your services and manage hosting packages.

39
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.390
And then you should see your hosting package in this list.

40
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.350
I've got a number of packages that I'm not using anymore but there is my RA Percival's test hosting

41
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.510
package and if you click on that missing package it will take you to the panel.

42
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.590
But I will warn you it takes up to an hour for hosting packages to be fully set up so you might want

43
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.110
to go away.

44
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.820
Have a cup of tea and then come back when the time has passed.

45
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.230
Damn that all right let's go.

46
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.600
So I'm going to click on the hosting package and that will redirect me to the see panel so at the top

47
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.510
here we've got all of our file options.

48
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.350
We'll be looking at the file manager and a bit more detail in a moment.

49
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.600
Then we've got our email options so we can create mailboxes access web mail set up forwarding and various

50
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.160
other things to do with email.

51
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.390
Note that they will only work if you have your own domain name so you will need to purchase a domain

52
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.770
name to use email.

53
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.030
Then further down we've got lots of options which we'll be using later on in the course of various stat's

54
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.040
features databases and a lot more.

55
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.500
I'm not going to go into all of them now but feel free to post the video and have a click around.

56
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.000
If you want to see what's available.

57
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.920
So first off I'm just going to quickly show you how to use file manager to edit your files.

58
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.570
So here are the files in your hosting package.

59
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.170
So we're going to double click on public HVM L and this is where you put all your documents that form

60
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.460
your website and you can see that the home page is indexed top HP.

61
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.290
Now ph is another programming language which we'll talk about later in the course on the web hosting.

62
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:13.270
You can name your pages either Toppi HP or dot HTL all but on your computer you'll need to use dot TNL.

63
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:22.420
So if we want to edit the home page we just control or right click and click edits and then we can get

64
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.730
back over to our text editor.

65
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:35.320
I'm going to use command a control on Windows to select all of this text and then copy that and then

66
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:43.520
use command a to select all of this text and command or control the two pasted in.

67
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.540
So this now is all of our code for our page that we created but it's on index indexed page here on our

68
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.770
hosting.

69
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.370
So let's say that there we go.

70
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:04.600
And then it's saved and now we can go back to our panel and if we want to see that page in action then

71
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.960
we can click temp web address here and click visit web site and there you go.

72
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.530
So this is your Web site live on the web and you can share this link with anyone and they will be able

73
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.560
to see your web site.

74
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.220
Notice how it appears under this Web address and if you don't purchase the domain name then you'll need

75
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.610
to use this to refer to your website when you're sharing it with people.

76
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.760
So if you want to use your Web site as an actual Foleo site or a blog or something like that you probably

77
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.840
want to purchase the domain name but that's completely up to you.

78
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.450
So that's as far as we're going to go in this video.

79
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.800
But there is one more thing I'd like to show you before we move on.

80
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.920
And that is you'll notice that using the file manager is not particularly convenient.

81
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.680
We don't want to have to be copying and pasting from our text editor every time we want to update our

82
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.290
site.

83
00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:01.250
So there's a much better way to access your files and that is through something called T.P. F-Type is

84
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.370
short for file transfer protocol and is essentially an easy way of uploading and editing files on your

85
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.860
website.

86
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.910
You'll need to download a couple of bits of free software and I'll lead you through how to do that in

87
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:13.740
the next video.
