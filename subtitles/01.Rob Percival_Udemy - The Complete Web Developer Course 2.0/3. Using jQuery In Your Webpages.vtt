00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.490
Now that we know what Jaker is and why we should be excited about it let's see how easily we can put

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.330
it into our web pages.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.310
And I'm actually going to show you two different ways to do it and we'll look at the advantages and

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.060
disadvantages of each.

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.950
So first off let's jump back over to our text editor and I got good old javascript or HDMI all set up

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.590
then.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.780
I'm going to save that as a new file and I'm going to create a new folder.

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.330
So this is number four.

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.400
And I'll call it J.A.G. OK and we'll save it there.

10
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.000
But I will call it Jay Queretaro HMO

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.600
OK.

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.030
And as usual we'll start with an empty l document

13
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.190
and we'll call it take very OK.

14
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.610
So we don't need that anymore.

15
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.730
So let's get ourselves

16
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.500
split up and let's see first off the quickest way to get going with Jake Weary and that is to google

17
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.380
for something like in bed.

18
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.720
Jay query so this is what we're trying to do we're trying to embed Jay query into our page so that we

19
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.180
can use it.

20
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.100
And thanks to Google we actually get the answer without even having to go to another page because Jay

21
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:34.640
query is hosted on Google API is dot com and we can grab it right there.

22
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.770
So all we have to do is copy that script tag and put it usually in the head of our page.

23
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.610
So we saw the script at the end of the previous section.

24
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.070
This allows us to take the version 2.2 of Jay query and use it in our page.

25
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.490
Now this is a great way of doing things and it's actually what I'd normally recommend for production

26
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.550
web sites.

27
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.960
The you are l Google IPs dot com is extremely reliable.

28
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.070
It's probably faster than your own web hosting.

29
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.280
And because a lot of Web sites already use this link there's a good chance that it's already downloaded

30
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.360
and cached only use his computer.

31
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.810
So if that's the case they won't even have to download it again.

32
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.780
Which means that your web site will load even faster.

33
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.600
The slight downside however is that you are relying on another web service Hey you don't have any control

34
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.590
over Google API.

35
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.290
And it's extremely unlikely but they might go down or they might change their you or else or do something

36
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.830
that actually breaks this link.

37
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.860
So if you're the sort of person that wants complete control of your code you may not be keen to do something

38
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.230
like this.

39
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.130
How would you get a query in that case then.

40
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.670
Well that's method number two.

41
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.540
And this is where we go back to Jay queery dot com and we clicked that big orange download Jay queery

42
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.440
button.

43
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.840
So I'm just going to click on that and I'd recommend going for Jay queery 2.2.

44
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.960
And if in doubt go for the compressed version because that's going to load more quickly.

45
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:12.990
So then just say that in fact I'm going to save it directly into my Jay query folder and I'm going to

46
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.170
change his name to make it a little bit easier.

47
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.720
Type in.

48
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.110
I'm just going to call it Jay Querrey don't mean Doc J.S..

49
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:30.080
So now it's an external javascript file but it's stored on my computer so I don't have to worry about

50
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.250
Google servers ever going down.

51
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.510
It's only going to be linking to code on my server.

52
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.050
This is also handy when you're developing a site.

53
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.510
If you're for any reason working off line or if you've got a bad internet connection then working with

54
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.810
a local version of Jay Querrey will mean that you're not downloading information from the internet so

55
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.350
everything will happen faster.

56
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.740
As long as you're working completely off line.

57
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.700
So those are the two ways that you can use a query.

58
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.440
I'd generally go for the first one in a production site but I'm going to keep with this one for the

59
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.310
rest of the section for no particular reason other than it's already there.

60
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.560
It also means I'm not relying on my internet connection at any point.

61
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.170
All right.

62
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.840
So let's now go back and open this

63
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.240
page up I'm just going to put a quick hi there so I know that I've got the right page when I find it

64
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:36.930
and I'll open it by just going to find out or explorer in Windows and then into the desktop completely

65
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.670
and develop a course for Jay query and then Jay queery George TNL.

66
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.440
There we go.

67
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.640
I'll just say that it's and we should get the correct content.

68
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.200
There we go.

69
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.870
Hi there.

70
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.590
So one question that might come to mind is how do we know whether or not Jay query is actually loaded

71
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.010
it doesn't do anything.

72
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.130
Well one way would be to start typing some query and see if it works but that's not a great solution

73
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.500
because you might want to have some kind of javascript code that at least runs if a query is not working.

74
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:18.500
So let me show you how we can test for a query in a reliable way.

75
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.110
Remember Jay query is just a framework.

76
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:30.480
On top of javascript everything works in a very similar way to javascript's and we put all our Jey query

77
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.940
code in exactly the same place that we would put how javascript code.

78
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:42.800
So if our J query is up and running there will be a variable called J query.

79
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.090
Now this is very promising but it's come up with this already because it means that my text editor has

80
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.820
picked up on the J query here and it recognizes J query as a variable.

81
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.850
So I'm feeling confident but I want to be sure and I want to run it in my web page over here.

82
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.110
So how do you test if a variable exists.

83
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.110
Well what you do is you look for a type of variable.

84
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:18.530
So each variable has a different type and if a variable doesn't exist that type is going to be undefined.

85
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.530
And if you just put a single equal then that would have been bad.

86
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:28.400
So what this does is looks at the type of the variable J query and tests whether or not it's undefined.

87
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.720
So if it is undefined then that means J Querrey hasn't installed correctly for whatever reason so will

88
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:41.290
alert Jay Querrey is not installed.

89
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.590
But if it's not undefined that means it exists.

90
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:57.560
So we can alert Jay Querrey is installed correctly.

91
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.580
So I'm hoping to get the second alert.

92
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.470
Let's refresh the page and find out.

93
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.630
Jay query is installed correctly.

94
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.600
Fantastic.

95
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:15.290
That's just make absolutely sure that this is doing what we hoped and get rid of this script temporarily

96
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.740
and then run the page again.

97
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.340
And you can see Jay query is not installed.

98
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.480
So this is a good thing to do at the beginning of your web page creation.

99
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.950
If you're using Jake J.A.G. just do a quick test to make sure that everything's up and running.

100
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.530
Otherwise you might write a bunch of code and it wouldn't work and you don't know why and then you realize

101
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.500
you're Jay queery link is wrong or something like that.

102
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.830
OK so now we're up and running with Jay queery.

103
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.900
We're going to continue in the next few videos to see how we do some of the things that we have already

104
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.670
learned to do in javascript NJ Querrey and generally will find that there are a lot easier and more

105
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.380
flexible when we're doing them in query than they are in javascript.

106
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.490
I've just noticed as well that we don't have a type.

107
00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.670
They're always going to have a type.

108
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.260
I will put that in text slash javascript.

109
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:03.800
Really.

110
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.710
OK so let's move on and see how we detect a click and do something in response with Jay query.
