1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,860
So we're finally ready to write.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,780
How first ever web page if you follow the instructions in the previous videos you should have a big

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,630
white page in front of you ready to accept your code.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,070
Just before we write any code we're going to make sure that we're editing the right file.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,500
So in your text editor just get a file and then save as.

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,380
And I'm just going to expand everything here by clicking that down.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,110
You probably need to do that and I'd recommend working on your desktop.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,920
This is where we're going to be storing all your files.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,170
So if you want to put them in your documents or somewhere else then feel free.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,720
But if you're not sure then just put them right here on the desktop.

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:48,300
Now I'm going to create a new folder for them to be nice and organized and I'm going to call it complete

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,610
web developer course

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:00,300
create and then I'm going to create another folder within that called Chapter 1 and then DML.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,730
Now it is amusing no spaces and all small letters here as is normal in web addresses and file names

15
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,790
that are going to go onto the Internet.

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:20,300
So I'd recommend you do the same there and then we'll change the title of our document to Hello World

17
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,830
dot h DML the dot h t m l extension tells us it's a web page.

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,660
We're going to be looking at that in a little more detail in the next video.

19
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,910
But for now just leave it has Hello world.

20
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,120
H T i m l and safe.

21
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,540
And now just to check where that file is.

22
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,310
We can move our text editor and our browser out the way.

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,580
And there it is.

24
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,680
There's my lovely complete web developer Corps folder on my desktop and if I double click on there I

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,600
can see the one HDMI folder and then the hello world h will file in there.

26
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:05,780
So let's add a quick bit of content to our Hello world file and it's can be a very simple hello world.

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,430
This is the standard first thing to write whenever you are learning to program.

28
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,210
So I'd recommend doing that but if you want to change it to anything else then that's fine.

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:22,150
And then we get to use command or control as to save where you can go to File Save if you prefer.

30
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:30,560
And now finally we get to go to our Hello world on HVM L and I'm going to control click or right click

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:38,960
on windows open with and then Google Chrome and that will then open our Hello World Team HMO file in

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,620
our browser and Verity's.

33
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,130
Wonderful.

34
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,200
Congratulations.

35
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,170
Might not look like much but that's your first ever web page which is quite an achievement.

36
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,060
I think now we're just going to set ourselves up for the rest of the course in which we're going to

37
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,510
be using a split screen set up.

38
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:09,260
So you just need to resize your windows so that we've got the browser on the left and the code editor

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,030
on the right.

40
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,280
You can do this automatically I think but I quite like doing it manually to make sure everything is

41
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,900
set up exactly as I want it.

42
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:28,160
And then the great thing about having two programs like this side by side is that we can change how

43
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,260
text editor and change our code to something like.

44
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,320
Hello Rob.

45
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,610
We can use command or control as to say that.

46
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:45,470
And then we can just reload this page by clicking the error that or command our own Mac or F5 on a PC

47
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,000
and then updates straight away.

48
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,710
So this is how we're going to be working with code pretty much for the rest of the course.

49
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,270
We're going to be coding something over here on the right.

50
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,460
And we're then going to see the results straight away.

51
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,840
On the left which is really exciting and dynamic way of coding.

52
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,140
So congratulations on making your very first web page in the next video we'll be finding out what exactly

53
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,970
this TNL that I've been talking about is and how we can start writing some.
