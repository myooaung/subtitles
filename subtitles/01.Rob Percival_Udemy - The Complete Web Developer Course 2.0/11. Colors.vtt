00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.100
So other we've learned how to apply CSSA to different portions of our HGL.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.880
We're going to in the next 50 years look in more detail at specific CSSA styles and we'll start with

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.370
one that we've looked at already and that is color.

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.790
So we've already looked at two different ways of changing the color of your document.

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:26.610
So the first is applying the color of the text and for that we just use color and then whatever color

6
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.460
we want.

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.490
The other one we've seen is changing the background color of an object and that's pretty easy as well.

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.090
Background Dasch color and then whatever color you want.

9
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.590
Of course are not all colors have names.

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.050
You might want to be a little bit more precise about the color that you want rather than just plowing

11
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.530
the browser to decide what sort of blue you want.

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.540
And there's a much more accurate way to use to get perfect colors and that is using age TNL color codes.

13
00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.660
So have a quick google HVM l color coats and that will take you to most likely a similar color codes

14
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.420
dot info or similar site.

15
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.610
So I'm going to use this nice diagram here.

16
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.760
And then we can click on any of those squares to get a particular color code for that color.

17
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.010
So let's say I want to use that particular shade of green.

18
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:29.810
I think I'd say it is then this here is what's known as it's alphanumeric because it's got letters and

19
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.020
numbers in it.

20
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:41.870
Color code if I want to use that instead of a name for the color will I do is I replace the name Pink

21
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:49.910
with the code and notice that we need to have a hash symbol before the code and my text editor here

22
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.670
even knows what color that is.

23
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.520
Which is nice.

24
00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.440
So then if we go back and have a look at our page that background has changed to that nice light green

25
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.230
So that's more or less all there is to it just to show you on HCM l color code so them for you can also

26
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:17.110
use a color picker which allows you to be a lot more accurate and you can choose a whole range of different

27
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.400
colors and shades and it will give you the color code for that.

28
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.590
So let's say we want to sort of lightish blue here and we can just copy that.

29
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.420
C'mon see our control-C.

30
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.210
And then I can make that the background for my second section.

31
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.090
Of course I do need to put the hash at the beginning.

32
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.770
And then we get one final thing before we move them.

33
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:51.730
You'll notice this little eyedropper that's appeared up in Chrome plug in called Color Zyla.

34
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.130
There's lots of similar plugins that do the same thing but this is the one that I use.

35
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.670
It works and it's really simple.

36
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.420
And what that allows you to do is essentially steal any color from any web site or app that to use in

37
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.590
your page.

38
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.730
So for example I really liked the color in Google's logo on that G there.

39
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.200
And I wanted to use that particular color in my website somewhere.

40
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.430
I would take my eyedropper having installed color Zilah or something similar and then pick a color from

41
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:31.080
page and then you can see what's happening here is as I move my cursor around it's picking up the colors

42
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.520
underneath it and giving me the code for it.

43
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.530
So if I get over that then it's it's got that nice blue color.

44
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.510
So if I click it's now copied that color to the clipboard.

45
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.590
So if I then changed my blue here.

46
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:58.510
From the default blue to that particular color code then I now get a much nicer sort of softer blue

47
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.020
than I had before.

48
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.690
So that's a nice cheeky way if you see on the web a color that you like the look of then use colors

49
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.730
Zilah to steal it and apply it in your own web pages.

50
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.060
Great.

51
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.720
So that's how we use any color we want in our Web.

52
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.270
Next video we'll look at the arrangement of our HTL elements using floating.
