00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.400
So now that you know how awesome bootstrap is let's see how we get started with it.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.190
A quick note first about bootstrap versions though as you can see from get bootstrapped come on my computer

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.370
version 3 is currently the latest version but bootstrap 4 is on its way.

4
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.260
Although they're very similar in many ways.

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.940
Bootstrap four has got a lot of cool stuff and is a completely rewritten version of bootstrap 3.

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.360
So I'm going to be focusing on bootstrap for this course.

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.810
So that means if you're watching these videos and when you go to get bootstrapped to come it says version

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.460
3.

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:40.130
Then you should have a quick google for bootstrap for and then click on the top result.

10
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.680
So as I'm recording these videos bootstrapped for the alpha stage so I'm going to be using this Web

11
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.160
site.

12
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.410
But you might be using a different one if version 4 is in bita for example or if you go to get bootstrapped

13
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.130
Treptow come and it says currently version 4 then you can just use that version.

14
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.430
Either way I'd recommend starting off by clicking the big download boot strap button and then on my

15
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.910
page I'm going to click introduction and then scroll down.

16
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.670
And we'll see a nice starter template there if you're working on get bootstrapped up come then it's

17
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.310
a slightly different navigation you click the download button and then you scroll down until you see

18
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.440
the basic template.

19
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.760
So same thing with a slightly different way of getting that.

20
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.080
Either way selects the basic template.

21
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.560
So just command C or control C and then back over to brackets.

22
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:51.470
And I'm going to replace everything in my J query h g m l file and then I'm going to go file save as

23
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.580
and I'm going to create a new folder in my complete web developer folder

24
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.010
new folder and I'm going to call it 5 Dasch bootstrap

25
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.740
and the file I'll call strap TNL

26
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.820
that we get very quick challenge for you then.

27
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.560
Can you update the R L here so that we're looking at the bootstrap file rather than our old jay Querrey

28
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.210
one.

29
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.130
Go for it.

30
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.880
All right.

31
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:43.210
Hope you got what you need today is change for Jay Querrey to 5 dash bootstrap because that's the new

32
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.380
folder.

33
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.990
And then I called it bootstrapped our HMO and there we go.

34
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.190
So you can see the already out Hello world is nice and styled and looking good.

35
00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.090
Great.

36
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.070
So we're all set up.

37
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.460
But just before we dive any deeper into bootstrap let's just make sure we understand what's going on.

38
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.160
In this example file that we've downloaded and I'm also going to change the layout a little bit to spread

39
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.870
it out.

40
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.750
And get rid of any comments because they look a bit messy.

41
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.110
OK.

42
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.350
So we're used to having each e-mail tag with a language attribute.

43
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.500
We've seen that before and then move up ahead.

44
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.240
We've got the character set UTF.

45
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.820
We've seen that before and we've also seen the viewport metal tag.

46
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.360
This is a the one that the X compatible tag.

47
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.410
Essentially it's a specific tag for Internet Explorer and it's used to control backward compatibility.

48
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.610
So essentially if we change this to content i.e. equals 8 then that would make every version of Internet

49
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.200
Explorer after version 8 render the site using its Internet Explorer 8 compatibility mode.

50
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.520
So this is just a way to be sure that your site will display correctly in future versions of Internet

51
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.960
Explorer.

52
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.490
Now we're designing our site when Internet Explorer edge is the latest version.

53
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.250
So this line is a kind of safety net that if the next version of Internet Explorer displays things or

54
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.060
works in a different way to edge then our site will force it to use the edge compatibility mode so that

55
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.590
our site will display how we expect it to.

56
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.200
So it's not a critical line there but that's what it does.

57
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.170
Right then we've got our bootstraps VSS.

58
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.510
We don't need a comment there I don't think.

59
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.910
Notice this is being loaded from a CDN bootstrap CD and or content delivery network.

60
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.870
We saw this with Jay query and Jay queery UI and we also heard why it's generally a good idea if you

61
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.130
do want to download bootstrap though and hosted on your own web site you can do that.

62
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:55.730
The options right there in the download section just copy the CSSA and javascript files and then reference

63
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.230
them on your own site rather than using the Cdn.

64
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.260
But I'm going to leave this as is the integrity attribute there just confirms that you are using the

65
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:13.190
version of file that you think you are and the cross origin attribute there just confirms that we're

66
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.700
using this resource anonymously and not sending any credentials or logging details to be able to use

67
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.320
it.

68
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.950
Note of course that if you're using a slightly different version of bootstrap to me you'll have a slightly

69
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.940
different you Ariail here and that's fine.

70
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.910
OK.

71
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.860
In the header and body tags we're used to H1 we're familiar with.

72
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:44.790
And then you can see we've got how Jay Querrey script and how bootstrap Cdn or content delivery network

73
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.840
bootstrap J.S. Neith it does have to be that way round because bootstrap depends on Jay query.

74
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:59.530
So if you try and put bootstrap first then a lot of the JavaScript aspects of P-trap won't work.

75
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.730
All right.

76
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.980
How that makes sense.

77
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.420
Now we've got bootstrap up and running.

78
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.600
We're going to be looking at a number of its features.

79
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:12.330
But the first is the most important and that is how it allows us to create responsive web sites.

80
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.820
It does that using grids.

81
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.960
We're going to take a good look at the bootstrap grid system in the next video.
