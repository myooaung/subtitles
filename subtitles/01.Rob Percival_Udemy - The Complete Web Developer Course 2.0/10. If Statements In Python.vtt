1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.200
All right.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.340
So hopefully you're already enjoying the simple and straightforward syntax of Python.

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:13.320
I'm actually going to start this video on if statements with a challenge and that is that can you work

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.040
out the Python syntax for an IF statement from the syntax for a follow up.

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.570
It's pretty similar.

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.800
See if you can figure it out.

7
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.000
OK.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.960
Did you manage it.

9
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:44.650
Well then if say I'm going to put back in name is equal to drop and then the if statement is very simply

10
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:55.310
if and then name and then double equals as were used to equal to rob.

11
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.010
This is testing whether name is equal to rob.

12
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.740
Rather than setting name equal to rub and then we can to use the colon just like we did in the follow

13
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.480
up and then

14
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.230
we'll do whatever we want to do.

15
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.810
If that statement is true afterwards so simple as that.

16
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.810
Let's have a look.

17
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.700
I rub.

18
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.080
And just to check make sure it's working correctly.

19
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.850
We change that to roll but it doesn't do anything.

20
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.360
So that's how IF statements work super straightforward and easy to read to put an else clause in then

21
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:50.630
we just return back to the edge of our code so we can remove any indenting and then we have an ELSE

22
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.650
command.

23
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.530
And another colon and then we'll print something like.

24
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.490
I don't know you.

25
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.760
So now we've got Hello Rob or

26
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.640
the name is Keston.

27
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:23.020
I don't know you and we can also add extra statements here and just put in the syntax and or so we could

28
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.940
have name is equal to say

29
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.390
cast in their and then allow just a general name.

30
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.890
So then rob or Keston would be allowed in.

31
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.870
Anyone else would not.

32
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.250
OK.

33
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.110
So that's pretty much all there is to if statements.

34
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.490
I'm now going to give you a slightly meta programming challenge than the one you had in the previous

35
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.170
video.

36
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.690
This is one of my favorite programming challenges.

37
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.270
It's not too tricky but it definitely gets you thinking.

38
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:12.020
And that is you need to create a program which displays the first 50 prime numbers.

39
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.120
Now if you're not sure what a prime number is essentially it's a number that has precisely two factors

40
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.630
or 2 numbers that go into it and those two factors have to be one and itself.

41
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.900
So for example 2 is a prime number because the only numbers that go into two are 1 and 2 but six is

42
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.260
not a prime number.

43
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.350
Because two and three also get into six.

44
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.630
So I'll tell you what the first few prime numbers are.

45
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:52.040
They are two three four is not because two guys into it 5 7 11 is the next one etc..

46
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.120
So you can look that up if you want to clarify that definition a little bit but hopefully that gives

47
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.550
you a clear idea.

48
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.110
And we want to have a loop which is going to have a few If statements in it which sets it up in any

49
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.180
way you like to display the first 50 prime numbers.

50
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.170
Off you go then.

51
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.710
Best of luck

52
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.560
OK.

53
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:28.380
Well I'm going to start with a WHILE loop so I'm going to start with a variable called number of primes

54
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.560
to count the number of primes that we have.

55
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.780
And I'm going to set that initially to 0 8 and we're going to keep going as long as the number of primes

56
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.380
is less than 50.

57
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.960
And then once we get to 50 we'll stop.

58
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.750
And then within this wild ape I'm going to start at the first prime number.

59
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:04.170
So that is two and then I'm going to increase by one each time and then check to see whether that number

60
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.260
has any factors other than 1 or itself.

61
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.930
And if it does it's not a prime number so I won't display it and if it doesn't it is a prime number.

62
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.920
So I will say see how that's going to work.

63
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:28.160
That's half of our number which at the beginning of the program will set to two.

64
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:43.180
So now I'm going to do a follow up and I'll call this I and we'll loop through a range starting at 2

65
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.660
opti number.

66
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.570
So we're starting at the number two and then let's say we're doing the number 10 we're going to go to

67
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.500
three four five six seven eight nine.

68
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.270
I remember this range doesn't actually include number which is just right for us because we don't want

69
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:12.390
to check if the number divides itself because every number divides itself.

70
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.550
So that's our second leap.

71
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.900
And then we want to check if a number divides another number.

72
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:26.030
We actually saw how to do that in Javascript in the age Tim L5 section and the syntax for doing it in

73
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.850
Python is exactly the same.

74
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.530
So it's just if.

75
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.040
And then to get the remainder.

76
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:43.060
When number is divided by we use number and then percent I.

77
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:50.960
And if I divide exactly into number then the remainder is going to be zero.

78
00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:02.600
So if this has happened that means the number is not prime because a number must go into it.

79
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.810
Exactly.

80
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:14.590
So I'm going to deal with that by having a variable called is prime which is initially true.

81
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:25.650
So I'll assume that every number is prime until I find another member that goes into it.

82
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:34.480
So once I found another number that goes into it then his prime becomes Foldes So then we want to end

83
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.100
the if statement so we get back 1.

84
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.390
We also want to.

85
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:45.410
And the for loop but we want to stay in the major while loop.

86
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:57.330
So then at this point we're going to check to see if is prime is equal to true and if it is we want

87
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.660
to do two things.

88
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.550
So we want to print the number

89
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:13.710
and we want to add 1 to the number of primes that we have.

90
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.860
We can do that using plus equals 1.

91
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.690
If it's not prime We don't want to do anything.

92
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:32.390
But either way we want to add 1 to number so that we can then go on and test the next number.

93
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:39.150
And just before we run that there is one change I need to make and that is that in Python.

94
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.370
True and False begin with capital letters.

95
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.380
So we should always use capital-T in capital F for true and false.

96
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.300
And there we can.

97
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:57.020
So those are where they look very much like the first 50 prime numbers.

98
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.560
So to get through that fairly quickly just to go through once again what's going on here.

99
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:09.720
We're setting the number of primes that we've got to zero and we're setting the number that we're testing

100
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.590
at any given time.

101
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.270
To start off at two because we know that that's the first prime number.

102
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.260
And then we're keeping going as long as the number of primes is less than 50.

103
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.560
So it will stop when we get to 50 and initially we're assuming that the number that we're testing is

104
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.780
prime because we're setting is prime to be true.

105
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:39.060
And then we're taking I in a loop from 2 up to the number that we're testing and we're checking to see

106
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.330
if I divide number.

107
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.290
Exactly.

108
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.600
And if it does then we'll set is prime to falls.

109
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:54.300
So if number was 10 for example then we would go to 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and divide each of those into ten

110
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.720
and see if any went exactly of course for 10 2 and 5.

111
00:09:58.890 --> 00:09:59.590
Exactly.

112
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.110
So which set is prime to be false.

113
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.550
And then at the very end once we'd done all that testing we checked to see if Prime is true.

114
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.570
Then we print the number out and we add 1 to the number of primes that we've got.

115
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:20.540
Then regardless of what we do we then add 1 to the testing number and then we just keep going until

116
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.230
we get our 50 primes.

117
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:29.300
So looking at that we're doing something pretty complex there but it's a really simple and really brief

118
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.060
chunk of code that does all that for us.

119
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:37.370
There's no curly brackets and even very few parentheses in the next video.

120
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:43.620
I'll show you the last piece of the Python puzzle before we make our Python mastermind game.

121
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.000
And that is functions.
