1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,370
All right with steaming through our e-mail tags now and we're going to move away from paragraph tags

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,910
and look at the lists in the next couple of areas in this video.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,710
We'll look at an ordered list.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,220
So basically a bullet point list is what we're trying to create here.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,360
And an unordered list we create with the UL tag.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:28,130
So the UL tag creates an unordered list and then within our unordered list I'm going to use tab to get

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,010
it indented again.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,730
We have a list item

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,880
so I'm going make a list of my family members.

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,890
I'll start with me.

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,040
So that's it.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,920
I've got an unordered list at the beginning.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,400
I'm closing the unordered list.

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:55,190
And then when I went to add a new list item I just do the same thing and then we'll add Kirsten in.

15
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,780
And then we want another list item.

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,420
So it had to me.

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,520
And finally Ralphy.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,230
There we go.

19
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,010
So let's have a look see what that looks like.

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,000
Beautiful.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,350
It's got Rob cast in Tommy and Ralphie.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,810
So that's how you create an unordered list in HD Mel has had a very quick challenge for you.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,370
Can you apply different formatting to each of the four elements in your list you can choose any bit

24
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,020
of formatting that you like but different formatting.

25
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,670
Bold.

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,460
It's Halik etc. to each element in your list go for it.

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,460
All right I hope you manage it.

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,180
I'll do something like this so robe can be strong

29
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,330
cast and can be emphasized.

30
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:05,810
To me a very unfortunately will be deleted and Ralphie can be inserted.

31
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,870
There we go.

32
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,710
Let's have a look.

33
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,320
There we go.

34
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,920
So we can apply this formatting to anything it doesn't have to be in a paragraph tag as we did in the

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,400
previous video text can be anywhere on our page.

36
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:18,940
Wonderful.

37
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,950
So simple as that.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,120
That's how we create an unordered list in the next video.

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,570
We'll see how to do very similarly an ordered list.
