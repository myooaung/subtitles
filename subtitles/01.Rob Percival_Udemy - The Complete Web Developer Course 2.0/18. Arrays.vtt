00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.390
So with variables we saw how we could create something which contained a value and then we could change

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.440
that value later on and use it in our code to achieve something.

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.490
Arrays take variables one step further and allow us to store a number of different values in one object.

4
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.060
Now that sounds a bit weird until you've seen it in action so let's just tidy things up a little and

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.290
create an array.

6
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.780
There's a few different ways of creating a raise in javascript.

7
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.130
I'm going to show you the most common ones here.

8
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.100
We actually use the keyword Val as before to create them so arrays are just variables but different

9
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.210
types of variables and we'll call it my array.

10
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.200
And then to tell javascript's that we want to create an array we use the command new and then array

11
00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.910
and we use parentheses because this is a function which creates an array for us.

12
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.510
So now we've got an empty array and we want to fill it with some values.

13
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.600
So let's say we want to store some food items in this particular array for some reason.

14
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:20.400
What we would do is we would take my array and specify which entry in the array we wanted to edit and

15
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.930
we normally start with 0.

16
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.710
So arrays start at 0.

17
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.600
My array and then squared back brackets zero and then we might set that equal to pizza.

18
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:37.420
So just in the same way that we set the value of a variable we can set the value of one item within

19
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.500
an array.

20
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.460
So my array 0 is now pizza.

21
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.050
Can you set my array one to chocolate.

22
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.510
Go for it

23
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.970
let's have a look.

24
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.890
You should have done something like Mirei square brackets.

25
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.220
One is the cruelty chocolate that get.

26
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.770
So how do we get those values if we want them.

27
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.150
Well just in the same way that we worked with variables in the previous video.

28
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:19.910
So if we want to get pizza we get alerts my array is there just like that.

29
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:29.190
Let's refresh and then we've got pizza that note if we want to view a whole array that's not that easy

30
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.070
to do within the page itself but it's very easy to do within the console.

31
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.310
So that's how I'd recommend if you want to check what the values of an array are.

32
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.700
While you're coding then you can use the console log.

33
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.950
And this is a very useful thing in general.

34
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.050
It essentially allows you to leave comments for yourself as you're developing your app which can help

35
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.920
you with debugging or just generally seeing what's going on.

36
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.230
And if we want to log the values within an array we just consult a log.

37
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.350
And then my array in parentheses and this can have a look obviously that doesn't display anything on

38
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.420
the page itself.

39
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:21.950
But if we right click control click and inspect and then click on the so it should show us.

40
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.380
There we go.

41
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.120
So it's array.

42
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.250
It's got two values in it and those two values are pizza and chocolate.

43
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.000
Notice also we've got the length of the array which is two and that's a very useful number to know how

44
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.740
many items that are in your array and we can get them just by using Mirei dot length.

45
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.480
So that will tell us how many items there are in the array.

46
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.510
If we have a look at that can see we just get returned because we've got two items in our right here.

47
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.650
All right.

48
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.650
So that's all well and good you might think but why on earth would I need one of these why can I just

49
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.340
do all these individual variables.

50
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.350
Well imagine you're making something like a Twitter clone and you wanted to display a user's tweets

51
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.290
as you're writing the program.

52
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.090
You don't know in advance how many tweets there are going to be because the number is going to change.

53
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.730
Also you definitely don't want to define a new variable for each tweet because you're going to have

54
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.920
to come up with a huge number of variable names.

55
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.290
Would be a very messy way to work with things.

56
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:30.870
So instead what you could do is create an array which we might call tweets and we're going to create

57
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.730
this in a different way just so you can see a different way to create an array.

58
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.790
So instead of using new array we can actually just assign the values of the array right at the start.

59
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.380
So incidentally just a pair of square brackets there will create an empty array.

60
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.750
So it does the same thing as that line.

61
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.830
But if you want to put some values in we might have this sort of thing people might tweet.

62
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.870
Morning everybody.

63
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.210
Something like that.

64
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.900
And they might say I love coffee that kind of thing.

65
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.010
What a Twitter feed this would be.

66
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.820
So now what we've got here is two tweets within our tweets array and hopefully this gives you a bit

67
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.330
of a clue as to why arrays are so powerful.

68
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.280
We could add as many tweets as we wanted to display them all we could delete ones we can edit them but

69
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.570
we only have a single variable name to deal with.

70
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.980
And it kind of makes sense.

71
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.910
It's just a single variable called tweets.

72
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.490
We don't need a different variable name for each of these because they're all tweets.

73
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.850
So pretty much any web app you could imagine is going to need arrays to store lots of data.

74
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:47.850
So you think of an email client for example has to store the user's contacts the users e-mails and all

75
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.630
sorts of other information that you don't know how many items there are going to be.

76
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.390
And in that situation are razor perfect.

77
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.860
So it's a very quick challenge.

78
00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.840
Can you alert the I love coffee tweet just to make sure that you've got the hang of how arrays work.

79
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.510
Go for it.

80
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.880
All right.

81
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.860
Hey you did it pretty easy.

82
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.580
Just alert.

83
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:19.830
And then we want tweets one that was the only slight trick you might have forgotten the arrays start

84
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.360
at zero.

85
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.500
And for that that was number one and then attempted to alert tweets to and then got an error because

86
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.880
tweets to doesn't exist.

87
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.590
So this is tweets zero.

88
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.130
And I love coffee is tweets one let's just have a look.

89
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.190
There we go.

90
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:34.640
Brilliant.

91
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.380
So what if we want to add a third tweet to our list.

92
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.530
So how user has just come along and tweeted something just as exciting as these two tweets and we want

93
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.510
to add it to their list of tweets.

94
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:46.930
That's pretty easy.

95
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.540
We can use the command push so tweets don't push.

96
00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:02.340
We'll add a third item to this array at the end of the array and then we give the value that we want

97
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.310
to add onto the end of our suites array.

98
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.950
So what's the sort of thing this guy might say.

99
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.930
Maybe something like back to work because he's hilarious.

100
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.520
So that will add back to work onto the end of the array.

101
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.190
So very quickly can you look to the console.

102
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.870
The tweets.

103
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.120
So we can have a look and see what's inside it now.

104
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:39.190
If you remember it that it's just so dot log and then whatever we want to log.

105
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.660
So in this case the tweets are right.

106
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.170
Let's take a look refresh the page and then control it right click and inspect

107
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.190
and there we go.

108
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.810
So there's our array it's got a length of three so three items in it.

109
00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.850
Morning everybody.

110
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.390
I love coffee and back to work.

111
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.200
Fantastic.

112
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.270
What about removing items from arrays.

113
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.450
That's pretty easy to do as well.

114
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.030
We've got a command for it within Javascript.

115
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:18.420
And this is spotlight's which allows us to do actually a lot more than just deleting but I'll show you

116
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.670
how we can get rid of one of these tweets.

117
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:27.700
So let's for example decide that our tweeter decides that his I love coffee tweet was rather inane and

118
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:33.930
wanted to delete it then we would give the splice command to variables.

119
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:39.360
Firstly the number of the item in the array that we wanted to start deleting.

120
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.030
So remember morning everybody is the zeroth item.

121
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.800
I love coffee is number one.

122
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.460
And back to work is number two just as it says over here on the left.

123
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:57.590
So if I wanted to say I love coffee would start at number one because I love coffee is number one.

124
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:05.130
And then if we just wanted to delete that one then we would say I want to delete one tweet starting

125
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.980
at item 1.

126
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.810
So that should delete just.

127
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.480
I love coffee.

128
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.950
And there we go.

129
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.360
Now you can see we've got left.

130
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.310
Morning everybody.

131
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.890
And back to work.

132
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:25.350
So what we're doing here is we're passing two variables to this splice function and they give the function

133
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.890
a bit of information.

134
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:32.820
So it says start deleting at item number 1 and delete one item.

135
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.570
So can you change our splice function so that we delete both.

136
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.380
I love coffee and back to work.

137
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.290
How would we do that.

138
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.840
All right I got it.

139
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:52.900
All we need today is change the second number to 8 2 and that will then instructed to delete two items

140
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.200
starting at item number 1.

141
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.550
So let's have a look.

142
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.800
We should just be left with.

143
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.140
Morning everybody.

144
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.880
Perfect.

145
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.360
We can also use the splice function to add in items.

146
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.350
So let's say we wanted to add in a tweet before.

147
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.720
I love coffee.

148
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.130
And what we would do is we say I want to add my new tweet at number one.

149
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:24.110
I don't want to delete any tweets and the content of the new tweet that I want to add in is I don't

150
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:24.740
know.

151
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.750
Corn Flakes for breakfast.

152
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.620
And of course the requisite exclamation mark.

153
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:37.130
So they should add in the item cornflakes for breakfast just before.

154
00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.120
Item number one.

155
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.460
Let's have a look.

156
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.130
There we go.

157
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.060
So now we've got morning everybody complex for breakfast.

158
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.780
I love coffee.

159
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.440
And back to work very quick challenge for you.

160
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.960
How could you change splice now to instead of just adding in cornflakes for breakfast.

161
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.970
Replace.

162
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.640
I love coffee with cornflakes for breakfast.

163
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.670
Did you manage it.

164
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:07.460
It's actually pretty straightforward.

165
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:15.230
We just change the zero to a 1 and this will mean we want to add in a new item before tweet number one.

166
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:21.410
But we also want to delete tweet number 1 and then add in cornflakes for breakfast so we should now

167
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.330
have just three tweets without.

168
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.160
I love coffee.

169
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.360
There you go.

170
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:33.060
And you can add in as many items as you like here as well as many inane tweets as you can imagine just

171
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.760
by separating them with comments.

172
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:41.640
So if our tweeter felt that cornflakes for breakfast wasn't enough information he might add I numb numb

173
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.150
tweet immediately after.

174
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.970
Let's have a look.

175
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.550
Hey we got your number.

176
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.180
Morning everybody.

177
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.980
Complex for breakfast I'm numb and back to work.

178
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:51.900
All right.

179
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.920
There's a huge amount more that you can do with a raise but that's as far as we're going to go for now

180
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.330
because I don't when you have to memorize lots of different functions.

181
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.340
But as we need them we'll come back to them and see what else we can do with a race.

182
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.900
You'll notice that what we've got here is pure code.

183
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.710
We don't actually have any content in our page at all.

184
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.200
And increasingly in the javascript section and the next section we're going to be looking at more complex

185
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.390
code to do more advanced things and this is really what programming or coding is all about.

186
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.570
It's not so much about the layout of your page as the logic behind it.

187
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.310
And that's where things get really powerful and I think really exciting.

188
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:31.860
And talking of logic we're going to learn our first logic command in the next video and that is the

189
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.200
if statement.

190
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.100
See you there.
