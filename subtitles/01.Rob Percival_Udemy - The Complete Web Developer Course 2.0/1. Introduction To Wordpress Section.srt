00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:06,980
Congratulations on making it to Section 7 of the complete web developer course I really enjoyed working

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:12,520
with bootstrap and managed to make a good looking landing page for your app or business.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,750
At the end of it in this section we'll be looking at something quite different and that is a package

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,370
called WordPress.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:26,030
Wordpress is a content management system or CMOS So it allows you to build a good looking Web site very

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,120
very quickly and you can edit and update it without actually knowing any code at all.

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:37,250
So if you're building a web site for a friend or colleague or a client then doing it in wordpress means

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,880
that they can update and edit it without needing to come back to you to change the code.

9
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:49,370
WordPress also has a massive plug in and thene ecosystem which allows you to build a great looking website

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:56,750
with just a few clicks and add powerful functionality like logging systems contact forms and even a

11
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,930
whole social network just by installing a plugin.

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,320
We'll see how to do a number of those things and we'll be working with a particular premium theme in

13
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,690
this section.

14
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,340
We'll be making a blog a shop and the challenge at the end of it will be to make a complete Web site

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,570
of your own using WordPress.

16
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,140
So a whole new world will open up to you in this section.

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,740
Wordpress is a great way to build web sites for friends and family colleagues or clients.

18
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,960
So do be still reading through my book How to and ten thousand dollars will and Kate coming up with

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,300
great website ideas.

20
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,600
And then using WordPress to put them together really quickly.

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,710
As always tweet me what you've made and I'll forward it to the world.

22
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,790
Enjoy getting to grips with Wordpress and I'll see you at the beginning of the next section.
