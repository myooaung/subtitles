00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.450
All right so now that we've seen how to run some javascript in an internal way we're going to see how

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.160
we can start interacting with elements on the page.

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.000
But the moment all we're doing is alerting something.

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.840
So that's a pop up which tells the user something.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.810
But very often of course what we want is for our code to affect something that appears on the screen

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.800
itself.

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.510
So let's get rid of our button and type in anything we like.

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.860
So I get back to the old standard hello world and then let's just make sure that that's updated.

9
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.360
There we go and of course we get our pop up as well.

10
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.930
So what if we wanted using javascript to update the contents of this paragraph tag and change the text

11
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.800
to something else.

12
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.000
That's a basic example of something we might want to do in a real life page.

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.160
For example if we've got a log in form and someone clicks the logon button without having intimate details

14
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.210
it would be a useful thing to show them a message to tell them to enter their details.

15
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.740
And this is how we would do that.

16
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.020
So let's get rid of our alert instruction and see how we access this element here.

17
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:20.550
Now as you may remember the classes and IDs that we used in CSA as I mentioned can also be used in javascript

18
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.750
and ID's and particularly are very powerful because the thing about IDS is they refer uniquely to an

19
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.510
element.

20
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.090
So it's very easy in javascript to get an element by its ID.

21
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.620
So let's get this paragraph text an ID of text and now let's find out the javascript for selecting that

22
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.030
and doing something with it.

23
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.970
So we start off by typing the key word document.

24
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.630
So document tells the javascript that we're going to be looking for something inside this document makes

25
00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:03.560
sense and then we use a don't go within the document and then we want to get an element by its ID.

26
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.030
So you've got that top on that and you could imagine maybe what those other ones might be used for as

27
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.610
well.

28
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.850
But we're going to go for get element by ID which does exactly what it says on the tin.

29
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.270
It gets an element by its ID.

30
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.450
Notice also the capitalization here because we're going to be using this throughout our use of javascript

31
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.410
to come into many programming languages where we start with a small letter and then each word in the

32
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.430
function name is the first letter capitalized.

33
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.470
So go get is all small elements begin with a capital A by with a capital B and ID with a capital.

34
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.170
So that's just quite a nice way of making it readable without putting in spaces or hyphens or anything

35
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.380
nasty like that.

36
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.640
All right so this instruction will get an element by its ID.

37
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.850
We need to tell it the ID of the element that we want.

38
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.690
So we put in brackets and you can see my text that is in here is telling me that we need a string which

39
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.990
isnt the ID.

40
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.190
So a string is just a bunch of characters.

41
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.560
So it goes in double quotes as we used to.

42
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.050
And then we just put in the ID.

43
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.030
So this will now get the element text by its ID.

44
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.740
So we've now got the element that we want to change.

45
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.840
How do we change it.

46
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:26.330
Well we add another dot and then use the instruction in the H TNL and this gets as you might imagine

47
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:34.700
the age TNL of this element with ID of text and we want to change that to something else.

48
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.380
So we said equal t and then whatever string we want.

49
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.100
So maybe I want to change it to.

50
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.170
Hello Rob.

51
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.640
Rather than Hello World.

52
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.620
And that's our full instruction.

53
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.480
So there's quite a lot of new stuff in there.

54
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.360
So take a moment to just go back and make sure you understand what each of those bits are doing.

55
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.750
I'm going to just quickly recap it for you.

56
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.400
Document means that we're going to get something within the document that we work in.

57
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.980
So that's this whole page tremelo document here and then get element by ID says that we want to get

58
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.380
an element within the document by its ID then we pass the ID that we're interested in which is text

59
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.600
and then we want to get to the in eight DML of that element which at the moment is hello world and then

60
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.050
we want to set it equal to something else.

61
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.660
I.e. in this case.

62
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.730
Hello Rob.

63
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.100
That's it.

64
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.890
I remember we've got an optional semi-colon and I'd recommend putting semi-colons at the end.

65
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.090
That will work without them.

66
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.460
All right.

67
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.130
Let's have a look.

68
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.920
So if we now save that and then run it you can see we've got halo Rob right there.

69
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.660
So it might not look that exciting but we want what we've managed to do there is actually change the

70
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.360
content of our page using javascript.

71
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.250
So that's a really powerful thing to be able to do.

72
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.080
One quick thing to show you before we move on is comments within javascript and this can be very useful

73
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.570
as you're writing your code to leave comments to remind yourself later on what your code is actually

74
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.510
doing or if someone else is going to be editing your script or looking at your code.

75
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.480
It can be very useful to them as well.

76
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.060
So there's a couple of ways to add comments in javascript and they're common to pretty much every programming

77
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.410
language out there which is great.

78
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.920
So if you want to have a one line comment you add a double forward slash their

79
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.400
And then if we just run that again it's no different at all it still works.

80
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.690
We still get al-Arab But obviously the comment doesn't do anything.

81
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:46.700
So you can write whatever text you like that Secondly if you want to add a multi-line comment you do

82
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.530
slash and then a star to begin the multiline comment and you can see that this is now commented out

83
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.990
this part here as well which we don't want.

84
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:03.620
So we have to end the multiline comment and we do that with a star and a slash.

85
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.640
So now we can put whatever we like in between those two.

86
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.180
And it will be considered a comment.

87
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:17.570
It won't be processed with the code because something like this is a multi dash line coming out.

88
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.210
We can put whatever we like in there as many lines as we want.

89
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.240
So just to check once again it's code still works.

90
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.800
I haven't broken anything.

91
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.490
All right.

92
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.770
So that's how you do both one line and multi-line comments in Javascript.

93
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.200
And it's also how we change the content of our page using javascript.

94
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.910
Of course doing that on the page load is not necessarily that exciting because we can't actually see

95
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.220
it happen because it happens so fast we never see the hello world.

96
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.810
So in the next video we'll see how we can use buttons to process javascript on demand i.e. when the

97
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:53.710
button is pressed.
