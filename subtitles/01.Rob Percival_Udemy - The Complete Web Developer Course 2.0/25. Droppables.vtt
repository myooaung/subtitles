00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.190
Great.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.820
So we've let that drag balls and resizable.

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:10.170
Remember our main aim here is to be comfortable with using documentation and examples to achieve what

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.910
we want using in this case.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.470
Jay Querrey plugins.

6
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.720
Now we've just got a couple more videos to go before we can do our Big Jay query project code player.

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.950
But here I'm going to set you a challenge.

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.490
Can you create a little square and a big square.

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.200
Two different colors and then make it so that you can drag the little square around.

10
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.280
And when you drop it into the big square you get an alert for

11
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.070
can be managed.

12
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.080
The idea of course was to use the drop label

13
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.440
interaction in the query UI.

14
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.760
That's fine find it's there it is.

15
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.480
So this has got this built in.

16
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.080
We can drag the first one around and then drop it into the second.

17
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.710
So really all you need to do is understand how this works and then apply it to the example that I gave

18
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.120
you.

19
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.870
So let's have a look at the source of this example which does everything that we want except instead

20
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.940
of letting the background go is yellow.

21
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.420
So we're going to need to add that in instead.

22
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.710
So let's have a look.

23
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.510
First off we make the first element trackable as fairly straight forward.

24
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.740
We've seen that before.

25
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.650
Then we make the second element drawable and all we need to do is add a drop function and then run some

26
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.850
code when that drop happens.

27
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.060
And that's going to be where our alert goes.

28
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.090
So pretty straightforward right.

29
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.820
Let's try it out.

30
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.440
So we'll start almost from scratch.

31
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.870
Because we get to one phase two boxes.

32
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.690
So it will leave resizable and we'll say but I'm going to remind them that makes a bit more sense.

33
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.270
So we'll have trackable and drop the ball

34
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.930
and drag a ball is going to be small and drop a ball will be big

35
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.810
let's have a look.

36
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.740
OK.

37
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.880
So that's what we want.

38
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.140
Of course I can't do any dragging or dropping as yet.

39
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:46.560
What I want today is take my draggle element and make it crackable.

40
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.660
All right let's just check that works first off.

41
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.210
Excellent.

42
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.600
So it's trackable but it's not yet drawable.

43
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.800
So now it's just a matter of putting in a drop of code.

44
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.510
So let's apply this to our drawable

45
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.570
and now this is where we need to add the code here.

46
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.620
So I need to copy everything between the two parentheses.

47
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.560
I'm going to copy the whole lot and then explain it as we go through it.

48
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.600
Let's have a look.

49
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:38.530
So we're adding a drop function and in fact I'm going to get rid of this code because that's all specific

50
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.490
to their example.

51
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.320
So all we need to add it is

52
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.530
what we want to happen when the drop happens.

53
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.040
And this is it.

54
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.490
So this is a function and it's a great event and UI here and they are parameters that will be returned

55
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.540
and we can refer to if we want to let's have a little look and just see what they are.

56
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.400
We'll need to look at the documentation for that.

57
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.820
So we're working with an event here and the event that we're working with is drop and you can see here

58
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.920
we've got event.

59
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.780
And this will tell you what type of event has happened.

60
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.420
Now the event as we can see in the documentation here is something like Blur focus load resize et cetera.

61
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.490
We've got a click option here which may be what returns.

62
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.450
In this case but what we're really doing is on

63
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.770
clicking we're lifting up a mouse to drop the object.

64
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.570
So we'll have a look in a minute and see what event is actually returned.

65
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.250
That's not particularly important for us.

66
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.630
The UI allows you to access various other bits of information so if you had a number of items that could

67
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.360
be dropped ball here then we could access the item which was dropped so we'd know which one it was.

68
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.380
And you can see we've got a helper object here as well.

69
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.830
We can access the CSSA position of the the [REMOVED] helper and also the offset position of that object

70
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.250
as well.

71
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.820
So I wouldn't worry too much about these.

72
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.660
I doubt you're going to need them unless you're doing anything particularly advanced but they are information

73
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.950
that we can access in our function if we want to.

74
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.860
The main thing that we want to do though is just have an alert.

75
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.170
So that's pretty straightforward.

76
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.110
And I'll just say dropped.

77
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.680
So let's take a look.

78
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:46.680
You can drag it around pop it in there and we get our at fantastic so I hope you manage to figure out

79
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.280
how to do at least most of that yourself.

80
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.640
One of the challenges of working with documentation is figuring out how far your understanding needs

81
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.190
to go.

82
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.900
And that will be definitely up to you and your situation and your personality as we might be the sort

83
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.370
of person that really wants to be clear on what event and UI are.

84
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.360
Well you might not care at all as long as it works but you need to be able to sort through the example

85
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.270
code and all of the API examples to get what you need.

86
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.610
All right let's just have a quick look then and see what event has been returned to him.

87
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.590
So alerting it didn't give us anything particularly useful because it's an object.

88
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.430
So let's see if we look at the console.

89
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.350
Maybe that will give us more of a clue

90
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:42.400
as to what it actually involves or just drag that in and then control click or right click and inspect

91
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:52.120
and let's have a look at the console so you can see we've got our event there.

92
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.270
And here we go we've actually got a lot of information in.

93
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.510
So I'm not going to go through what all of this information is.

94
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.080
Some of it you can probably work out most of it.

95
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:05.040
You're not going to be even remotely interested in the thing I was particularly looking for was the

96
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.040
type of event.

97
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:12.410
And so it is in fact a drop what you might be interested in is the two elements I mentioned.

98
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:20.280
So that tells you the element that's been dragged to it and as well as the drop element that was dragged

99
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.770
to.

100
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.110
All right.

101
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.990
So loads more information than you probably were interested in there.

102
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.170
We'll go back to that dropped for a sample code.

103
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:35.340
The main point again is that you need to be able to navigate the documentation to get the information

104
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:41.340
that you need and be willing to put to one side the information that you don't need.

105
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.720
All right.

106
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:47.560
So one more video before we make our code play a project is just looking at a couple of the widgets.

107
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.870
And those are accordion and sortable.
