1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,150
So in the previous video we created some stylings using in line CSSA.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,710
There are a couple of problems with this then burst is our styling is all mixed up inside our content

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,070
which makes it not very nice to read and difficult to maintain.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,730
Also our stylings are linked to a specific paragraph tag.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,390
So if I wanted to change all of my paragraph tags to a certain font or color or size I'd have to add

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,680
the style attribute to all of them which is messy.

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:33,730
So for that reason I wouldn't recommend using inline C as s except in very specific circumstances.

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,090
So the solution then is internal CSSA.

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,310
This is what we saw in the example dot com HVM L.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:50,120
So we create some internal CSSA by creating a style tag inside the head.

11
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:56,110
We can actually put it anywhere in the DML but inside the head section is the traditional place to put

12
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,090
it.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:08,280
We then set up a type for our style and the type is text slash CSSA.

14
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,060
So that then tells the browser that this is some style commands that then be applied to the rest of

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,510
the document.

16
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:21,820
So let's get rid of all the styles that we have and see how we can apply some styles from here to our

17
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,070
code in the body.

18
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,490
So just to reset everything we're now at the start with no style.

19
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:36,610
So if I want to apply say the color red to this paragraph tag then what I would do is I would start

20
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:43,930
with a P to say that I wanted to lie this style to all the tags in the document and then some curly

21
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:50,080
brackets add a bit of spacing and then whatever style I wanted.

22
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,320
So I want to color.

23
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,310
And then you can say we've got a nice selection of colors here.

24
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,750
Beautiful.

25
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,170
I'm going to keep it simple and go for red

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,180
so have a look.

27
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,990
There we go.

28
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,670
So that's how I applied the color red to that paragraph.

29
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,170
So a very quick challenge for you.

30
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,820
Can you double this paragraph text in size as well as keeping it red.

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,190
So make it twice as big.

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,820
Using internal stylesheets.

33
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,730
Go for it.

34
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,830
I hope you managed it.

35
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:43,950
All we needed was something like font size and then 200 percent.

36
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,450
Let's have a look.

37
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,490
I don't know something's going wrong.

38
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,090
I wonder if you did that.

39
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,680
If you did and you realized that you lost all of your stylings it was probably because you didn't put

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,760
a semi-colon at the end there.

41
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,500
And so just like when we were having our inline C S S We need to separate different styles with the

42
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,900
semi-colon in internal CSSA as well.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,340
So now we have a look.

44
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,570
We've got it read and twice as big.

45
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,430
Notice you don't need to put a semi-colon on the end of the last one.

46
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,630
You can do if you like.

47
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,020
I kind of like to because it makes everything uniform and the same def. doesn't cause any problems.

48
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,380
So the nice thing about this is that if we then create another paragraph tag.

49
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,530
Wow I love internals.

50
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,030
SS something like that.

51
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,540
Then of course this styling will be applied to that one as well.

52
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,800
If you want to set all of your text to the same font for example you could do that very easily with

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,340
a single instruction in your internal CSSA at the top there.

54
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,840
So final quick challenge for you can you change the CSSA is cool header to being pink.

55
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,560
Go for it.

56
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,070
All right I hope you managed it very easy.

57
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:14,540
So just H-1 to tell our browser that we want to apply these stylings to all the H-1 tags and then color

58
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,430
and pink and an optional semi-colon at the end there.

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,450
Let's have a look.

60
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,490
There it is.

61
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,580
Fabulous.

62
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,480
So this is internal CSSA and this is how we're going to be applying pretty much all of the assets that

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,340
we learn in this section.

64
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,530
There is one more way to do it that is to have all your styles in a separate file which can be very

65
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:36,970
useful.

66
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,300
And I'm going to show you how to do that.

67
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,700
At the end of this section what you might be wondering is how you might apply styles in this way to

68
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,320
some paragraph tags but not others.

69
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,740
And that's what we're going to look at in the next video.
