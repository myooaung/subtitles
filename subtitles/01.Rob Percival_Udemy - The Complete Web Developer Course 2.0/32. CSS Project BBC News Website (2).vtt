1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.190
OK so I'm making good progress on our clone.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.840
So far we've pretty much covered the top bar the top.

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:14.600
So our challenge in this video is going to be to recreate the dark and lighter red section of the head.

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.750
Here now you can see that we've got the red and darker red bars extend right to the edge of the screen

5
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.590
whereas the content has the same width as before.

6
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.510
So we're going to need an outer div which has a width of the whole screen and then in a div which has

7
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.340
a with the same as the top bar that we created up there.

8
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.870
So it should be pretty straightforward

9
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.080
definitely worth clearing our flights to make sure that everything appears below the top here.

10
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.030
So let's have a

11
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.480
special Dave to clear everything.

12
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.600
We're probably going to be using that more than once.

13
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.880
So I'll create it as a class and we just want to clear both lights.

14
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.310
Not that we've got any right flights at the moment.

15
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:22.430
And then I'm going to call this the menu bar for lack of a better phrase say I'm going to start with

16
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.340
an idea of menu bar container.

17
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.290
So this is going to be the full width div for this

18
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.530
lights have red background.

19
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.290
So let's just try and get our red color first off.

20
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.900
That looks good.

21
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.190
And then what did I call it Menu Bar container.

22
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.860
OK.

23
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.760
So you want a background color

24
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.180
of that and the width of 100 percent.

25
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.520
Let's have a look what we can do at the height as well.

26
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.280
Let's try 100 pixels to start off that's better.

27
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.440
OK.

28
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.280
So we're looking pretty good already in terms of heights.

29
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.900
I think that's a little bit high for just that top part.

30
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:49.180
So let's go for something like 70 pixels great then we're going to need our top bar menu bar Sorry Dave

31
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.230
to go within that

32
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.860
and that's going to be pretty similar but we want it it

33
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.580
and to have a with the same as the top or at the top.

34
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.210
Let's go right back.

35
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.270
Maybe we had a thousand pixels and a margin of 0.

36
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.770
Water which should

37
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.620
give us a laugh that we want and make it nice and scented as well.

38
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.550
So in terms of content we just want the word news that

39
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.490
so I think I'm going to use an H one for this.

40
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.140
I would get it so the text is then some strange padding coming in.

41
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.920
I would definitely need a little bit of styling as well.

42
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.150
Now you're going to have one each one on our page so we don't need to give it a class or an ID.

43
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:10.440
I think we definitely want to take away any padding or margins or less set padding and margins to zero.

44
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.880
For now we might want to put some back in again.

45
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:23.880
We definitely wanted to be white and I think we wanted to be a little bit larger than it is now.

46
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.130
So let's try a font size of 40 pixels.

47
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.160
See how that looks.

48
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.840
OK.

49
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.510
I'm pretty happy with that.

50
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.670
I think we actually don't want to be bold.

51
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.110
So let's set the font weight to be normal.

52
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.330
That's looking better.

53
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.050
It's not quite the same font but it's close enough.

54
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.910
But we do want a little bit of a margin at the top I think.

55
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:08.950
So we'll set margin top B it's too much maybe 10 pixels that's Have a look now that's moved down the

56
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.120
whole bar which is not what we want.

57
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.090
So let's switch that to a padding at the top that's better.

58
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.180
OK.

59
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.690
That's pretty good.

60
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.550
Pretty close to what we've got there.

61
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.100
And the real thing.

62
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.340
Fantastic.

63
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:34.880
So now we just need to have our find local news link and that image then I wonder if I can get it now.

64
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.790
Not easily.

65
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.640
OK.

66
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.010
Say while I'm here Aldie my screen shotting trick.

67
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.250
And then it's jump over and copy that image.

68
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.310
I'll call it a point.

69
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.000
That's probably a better name for it but that will spit into our images.

70
00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.360
Felda

71
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.190
OK.

72
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.860
So we want a little box there and a link inside with our image to the right of it.

73
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.070
So I think I use a div for that

74
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.880
after news but this is going to be inside Manuva.

75
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.960
Dave ID equals.

76
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.630
And let's remind ourselves what it actually says.

77
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.900
Find local news

78
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.720
so let's call this local news

79
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.480
and the text before I forget it.

80
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.450
It's going to be find local news.

81
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.760
Let me just check the capitalization.

82
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.550
All lower text will ok say.

83
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.370
I mean at the beginning

84
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.060
and then we're going to want our MH

85
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.970
and I call that point to

86
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.070
OK.

87
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.960
A quick look and see what that looks like with nice styling it still needs a bit of work.

88
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.390
All right.

89
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.100
No problem.

90
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.740
We can handle this.

91
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:24.220
So first off we need to get that H1 two flight left.

92
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.570
In fact we could possibly do without that.

93
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:33.410
Because what we're going to do now is get our day off which was cooled local dash news

94
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.370
and we'll get that to flight right.

95
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.250
There it is.

96
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.530
So we didn't actually need this flight left to cause any problems but let's get rid of it.

97
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.560
We get to keep the code simple.

98
00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:01.050
So I'm actually going to just get rid of the flight right temporarily so that I can see what I'm working

99
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.680
with here.

100
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.860
I have to make the browser window bigger and smaller every time.

101
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:14.880
In terms of we want it want quite large and centered with a small gray box around it.

102
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.080
Let's have color

103
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.900
white.

104
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.110
We do want it to be a link as well.

105
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.990
So I stress.

106
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.180
I'll just leave it blank.

107
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.250
In terms of its destination to write about work is

108
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.580
that then.

109
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.610
Now that's good but it hasn't made our link white.

110
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:54.500
And we're going to access that by using local news and then say that will then style all the links within

111
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.690
local news.

112
00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:04.950
So if we now have a look at that we didn't actually need that style and there we go.

113
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.050
So it is white.

114
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:13.400
I'm just going to temporarily pull back my flight left into the H-1 so that I can see it all that make

115
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.710
it a lot easier to develop.

116
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:17.430
I can't.

117
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.320
We want to get rid of that underlying text decoration.

118
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.400
None that we want to bring it back in on Hulver.

119
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.800
Local news.

120
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.240
I.

121
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.810
And then they have a pseudo class as we've seen before.

122
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.720
Bring back the underline.

123
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:46.780
So let's have a look at that lovely right we need it a little bit bigger.

124
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.800
So let's try font size of 15 pixels small

125
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.320
25 pixels.

126
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.860
Well don't forget pixels.

127
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.010
Every guy a little big.

128
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.380
Maybe I was right all along with my 15.

129
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.640
That is definitely too small.

130
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.140
Somewhere in between 20.

131
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.840
That looks about right.

132
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.290
All right.

133
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.640
Now the link is definitely a little bit low down.

134
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.700
So let's use a bit of positioning to me it back up again.

135
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:29.310
So relative positioning and then we'll set the top see let's try out minus 20 pixels that will move

136
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.570
it upwards.

137
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.780
OK that looks pretty good.

138
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.850
Let's try maybe 17.

139
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.570
I like that that looks more centered.

140
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.110
William Now let's style the image.

141
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.140
Just need to make that a bit smaller really and possibly change the position.

142
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:54.000
We could give the image optical ID but slightly more fancy would be to take our local Dasch news and

143
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.010
then style all the images within it.

144
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.390
And there's only one.

145
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:05.080
So that saves us having to create another ID for our pointer then.

146
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:11.520
So let's change the height to be let's try 20 pixels.

147
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.190
It's a little small.

148
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.700
Ah this is affected our link as well.

149
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.190
So we probably won't need our relative positioning there.

150
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.240
That's interesting.

151
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:31.260
So Alice is 80 pixels instead still a little small maybe 40.

152
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.180
OK.

153
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:39.720
Brilliant So I think that's about the right size find local news is now a little bit out of whack.

154
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.900
Say let's move it down a touch.

155
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.230
Not that much.

156
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.540
We want it to be roughly centered with the image

157
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.600
so how about that.

158
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.420
And then we want a box round the local news

159
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.480
should be fine.

160
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.710
See if I can get that color just right.

161
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:15.320
Finding my color picker to work that well at the moment but let's see what we can do.

162
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.170
There's the dark red

163
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:32.920
that I think is the lighter red let's give it a guy.

164
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:42.270
So let's set the local news Dave to have a border of one pixel color so that

165
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.760
OK that's about the right color I think.

166
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.300
But it's definitely extended further than we'd want Ben.

167
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.680
Let's have a look and find out why.

168
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.490
I think it's because we need to introduce our float.

169
00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.580
So that's now flight.

170
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.540
Let's see if we can get away with floating left temporarily.

171
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:13.880
We'll want to set a fixed with as well so let's go for something like 200 pixels OK so that now gets

172
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:19.760
the board of roughly how we want it the width is a little bit wide.

173
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.020
So let's go for 180 pixels.

174
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.230
Great.

175
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.850
I think we need a little bit of padding on the left and right and maybe a touch on the top to bring

176
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.730
it down a little as well.

177
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:38.210
Say let's go for five pixels at the top

178
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.970
and then five pixels on the right.

179
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.630
That's truly zero on the bottom.

180
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.900
See what effects that has.

181
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.040
And then five pixels on the left as well.

182
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.040
OK I'm liking that.

183
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.540
Maybe a touch more on the left

184
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.530
10 pixels.

185
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:02.760
Excellent.

186
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.670
That looks good.

187
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:14.020
Now we need to do is bring it down a little so we'll do that with a margin say at the top let's try

188
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:22.850
five pixels again and then we're going to want a margin right of let's try around 10 pixels and we're

189
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.170
not actually interested.

190
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.010
In bottom left margins because we're going to float it C a right

191
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:35.720
k let's have a look.

192
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:43.950
There it is fantastic.

193
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.050
That's not identical to that but it's pretty close.

194
00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.970
I think we can make the text a little bigger and be nice to align the bottom of the text with the bottom

195
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.570
of that image there as well as it is here.

196
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.310
So let's just do a little bit of playing around with that

197
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.970
if we can.

198
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:11.580
Bill Fletcher left again so that we can see it more clearly that we say we want the font size to be

199
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.600
maybe 60 pixels not too much that's the wrong one.

200
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.120
Font size lets try that.

201
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.320
It's a little large

202
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.360
26.

203
00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:34.740
OK.

204
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.510
I think that looks about right.

205
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:42.750
They need to increase the width 190 It's now right.

206
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:52.500
Two hundred still to narrow and to 10 still too narrow to 20.

207
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:53.550
Excellent.

208
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.460
That's better.

209
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.680
Now that I can see it there I think I want it even bigger.

210
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.040
Let's say for 30 and 40

211
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.290
250.

212
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:09.400
There we go.

213
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:10.310
OK.

214
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.610
So that looks good.

215
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.950
Maybe we don't need to move it up for any more let's have a look.

216
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.120
Maybe it will position itself.

217
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.060
No it's still too low down.

218
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.430
Without that repositioning so let's try moving it up.

219
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.070
Five pixels.

220
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.610
Little bit more pixels maybe every day.

221
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.110
Excellence.

222
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:39.010
I like that so let's just change the flight from left to right.

223
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.370
I think that looks pretty good.

224
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:50.450
One thing that you might have noticed that we're lacking though is this gray bar here which adds a nice

225
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.580
border between the top or as we're calling it and the top bit of the menu bar here.

226
00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:04.400
So let's put that in and we also need to make sure our lines line up with that.

227
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:12.170
So this is where it comes in has to be pretty pixel perfect so we can use our local news container I

228
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:22.570
think for this or a menubar contain a story and we'll give it a border top of one it's solid.

229
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:31.610
And we definitely have that color already because we used it on the left of the top bar menus with the

230
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.560
order left.

231
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.080
There we go.

232
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.500
That's what we want.

233
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.290
So let's pop it there.

234
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.640
Notice it doesn't actually matter what order we put these three in.

235
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:53.320
You can put the weight on the type and the color in any order you like and it'll still work it out.

236
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:55.340
Great.

237
00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:59.020
So now the bar is that which looks really nice.

238
00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.700
But those things aren't quite in contact with it.

239
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.140
So let's figure out why that is.

240
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:17.720
First thing to try might be to decrease the height of the top boss likely to move everything up.

241
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.040
That's Negat let's keep that 40

242
00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:32.480
let's just try setting the margin and padding to 0 9.

243
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.780
That's not good either.

244
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:43.220
So I suspect that it's something to do with one of these Dave's being taller than the rest and the only

245
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:48.570
one that doesn't have a left margin is this bell one because that's because the image is the left margin.

246
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:57.800
So let's just test out our theory by removing the Beldi of temporarily.

247
00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.200
Now that moves everything up beautifully.

248
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.770
OK.

249
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.480
So the Belyaev is definitely our problem.

250
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.300
Let's have a look.

251
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.400
Probably that's a little bit too tall.

252
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.270
OK we've got our margin here.

253
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.840
So nine pixels eight pixels.

254
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.990
All right so let's try changing the bottom margin to zero.

255
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.430
And we'll keep the left margin at 8 pixels.

256
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.540
So if that does the job.

257
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.160
There we go.

258
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.320
Very nice.

259
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:36.870
So now everything links up beautifully and things are really starting to say to take shape.

260
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:37.840
Great.

261
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:43.560
So now let's have a look at this menu bar down here.

262
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.340
So that's what we're trying to create next.

263
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:54.770
You can see first off that it's got a different read see the bar above.

264
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.320
So let's just get that read copy to the clipboard.

265
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:05.030
And

266
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.930
creates a new divs for us.

267
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.680
So we're now outside the menu bar

268
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:32.460
I'm actually going to call this very originally menu bar to and then add some styles for menu botty.

269
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.770
And the main one is that we want the background color.

270
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:49.180
It's to be that we also want to have a width of 100 percent and that's actually not many but it's many

271
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.800
about the container just like we had before.

272
00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.830
So we'll set that to be many botty container.

273
00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:11.340
And then within that we're going to have to ID and you bá to and this is where our menu will be contained.

274
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:29.690
And all will need for that is a width of a thousand pixels and a margin as we've seen before of 0 and

275
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:37.600
water that will give it a margin 0 or top and bottom but auto left and right which would make it nicely

276
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.420
centered for us and let's give it a high as well.

277
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:46.920
So let's try something like 80 pixels.

278
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:47.340
All right.

279
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.370
Let's take a look.

280
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:49.330
Aha.

281
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.970
So everything's good except it's not quite positioned where we wanted it.

282
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.310
Why is that.

283
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.350
It's because we haven't broken our flights.

284
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:08.610
So before that let's add a div with a glass of clear and that should clear up our flights and meet it

285
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.230
down underneath where it belongs.

286
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:19.480
So now we're going to run a string of links all of which are going to be styled the same.

287
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.960
So I'll start with the first couple home and UK and once we've got those right we should just be able

288
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:31.020
to add the others in to run them pretty big white and we want to have this border there as well.

289
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:49.860
So let's have and I again will have a blank ref and this will be home and then the same for the next

290
00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.410
link which I've forgotten already.

291
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.640
UK

292
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.120
that we get.

293
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.580
So let's see what they look like without any styling.

294
00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:04.990
All right.

295
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.900
Great.

296
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:17.380
So again we can style these using menu bar too.

297
00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:27.060
And then I add that will style all of the links within menu bar to the same set the color to white first.

298
00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:33.820
And we want know underline the text decoration.

299
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.660
None.

300
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.120
We want a bit of a margin at the top

301
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:47.820
let's try five picks and we want some padding left and right as well.

302
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:56.690
So you don't need any padding top and bottom but let's give it 10 pixels padding on the left and right.

303
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.660
And finally let's add our border.

304
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.030
Right.

305
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.020
Going to be one piece solid.

306
00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.250
And I think it's the same color.

307
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:15.980
As the border around we can't see anymore find local news there or at least it's close enough.

308
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:27.170
So let's use the same water as we did for local news which was this one maybe 4 5 4 5

309
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.390
OK.

310
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.140
Let's take a look.

311
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:37.180
That's not bad.

312
00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:44.830
I think they could do with being slightly bigger and my margin top obviously hasn't worked out there.

313
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:56.810
So I'm going to use font size Let's try 14 pixels and let's use positioning to shift them down a bit

314
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.730
OK.

315
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.990
That's actually made them smaller straight 18 pixels.

316
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.350
OK I think that's about the right size.

317
00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:21.460
And I think we can make the menu bar itself a little bit bigger and then move them down a little bit

318
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.510
more.

319
00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:24.560
I like that.

320
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.510
Maybe a teensy bit less OK.

321
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.120
Great.

322
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.820
So I'm pretty happy with that.

323
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.280
Something slightly strange going on with the padding here I think.

324
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.260
But let's add a few more and it might become clearer.

325
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.410
What parish you raise.

326
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.880
So we've got some if I can copy and paste

327
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.580
k.

328
00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:53.790
No problem.

329
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:54.850
Just the main

330
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.570
I just had a few blank

331
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:06.590
links them.

332
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:08.020
So we've got World

333
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.430
Business

334
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:14.920
Politics

335
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:26.100
science health education

336
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.670
entertainment and arts

337
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.580
video and audio and more.

338
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:01.840
OK.

339
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:06.360
Let's take a look at the more triangle later on.

340
00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:07.100
OK.

341
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.020
So this is good.

342
00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:13.920
We have a problem with our font size so let's make that font a little bit smaller.

343
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:18.300
Easy enough

344
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:26.330
try 16 still a little bit too big.

345
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:30.670
Try 14.

346
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:33.200
OK that's about right.

347
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.780
And then let's move them down a little

348
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.840
keep them sends it us white

349
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.610
one pixel Yes I think grepped.

350
00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.520
Now I'm going to bring in the underline on Hava

351
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.340
which I know is not quite the same

352
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.290
as what the BBC does but it'll be close enough.

353
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:11.290
We.

354
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:16.070
We need javascript's to get this to appear anyway.

355
00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:18.110
All right.

356
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:21.440
So what we need to really do now is add the down.

357
00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:25.430
And of course we want to get rid of this margin on the more link.

358
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.780
So let's do both of those.

359
00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:28.810
First off

360
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:38.940
screen and remember you can use the clip at all if you're on Windows that will command shift 4 if you're

361
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.550
on Mac and there it is.

362
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:52.060
So I'm going to cool it down hour and then copy it and put it in the images folder.

363
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.510
As before.

364
00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.230
Brilliant.

365
00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:59.200
So let's

366
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.460
edit that.

367
00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:11.030
First off we're going to need to get rid of the border on the final more link.

368
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:15.020
So let's get that a special class which I'll call no border

369
00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.400
and then

370
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.320
we can have a

371
00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.490
border class

372
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:36.330
which has border none.

373
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.310
So let's just have a look see if that's worked for us.

374
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:46.280
It hasn't that allows us to use a special trick.

375
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.890
Of exclamation mark.

376
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:51.900
And important.

377
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.830
And let's just make sure you can see that that's worked.

378
00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:02.660
So that's a really handy little trick that you can use when you've got to potentially ashing CSSA instructions.

379
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:07.580
So here we're telling every menu bar to item to have a border on the right.

380
00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:11.740
And here we're telling everything with a class of no border to have no border.

381
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.890
So how does the browser know which one to do if you want to be completely clear on it.

382
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:22.230
Then you use exclamation mark and important and it will make sure that this one has a priority over

383
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:27.270
anything which is not important as a handy little trick.

384
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:28.040
OK.

385
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:28.560
That's great.

386
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:34.400
And so all that remains then for this bar is to add in our image

387
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:42.590
images and then down our

388
00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.350
every day right.

389
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.000
A little bit too large.

390
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.880
So let's get an idea of

391
00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:09.000
down there and then we can fix all of that.

392
00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:09.420
All right.

393
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:13.600
So it's that's a little bit of a little high up there.

394
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.010
And it shifted everything down as well.

395
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:25.070
So let's try a height of 10 pixels and let's shift it down a little bit using positioning.

396
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:32.630
So I will give it a top of let's try 10 pixels as well just see what that looks like.

397
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.960
As it happens that looks pretty perfect.

398
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.250
I like that a lot.

399
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:40.960
Wonderful.

400
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:47.530
So that's our menu bar complete in the next video then we'll go and look at the left part of the main

401
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:48.540
section here.

402
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:53.160
So we'll do our technology link up there and then we'll have a bit of content.

403
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.670
And as to image right there as well.

404
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:58.140
I hope you're still enjoying yourself and you're staying with me.

405
00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.170
I'll see in the next video.
