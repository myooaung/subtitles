00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.270
All right so now we've seen the basic structure of a Web site we're going to create one for ourselves.

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:15.840
So let's close down these examples and go back over to our hollow world.

3
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.040
Now we don't want to call this Halliwell's anymore because we want to create a new file.

4
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:29.520
So I'm going to use file and then save as and I'm going to call it my web page.

5
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.540
You can call it whatever you like but I'm going to go for something nice and straightforward like that.

6
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.510
Now very quick challenge for you.

7
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.950
Can you make my web page appear in your browser.

8
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.080
Go for it.

9
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.180
I hope you manage that.

10
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.050
All he needed to do was go back to your desktop.

11
00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.540
Open up the complete web developer course go to Chapter 1 HD DML and then double click on my web page

12
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.860
and there it is.

13
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.860
Of course the actual content is the same as what we had before.

14
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.420
But we'll change that very soon.

15
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.860
So let's close that down and we'll close the Hello World tab as well because we don't need that anymore.

16
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.700
So just to be absolutely sure that we're editing the right file here let's get rid of.

17
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.980
Hello Rob.

18
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.330
And then during the text you just hi.

19
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.610
And then second mini challenge can you make the word Hi there.

20
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.040
So make your mark appear on your browser.

21
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.290
I hope you manage that.

22
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.450
You just need to save in brackets or your text editor and then refresh this page here.

23
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:55.330
So I used a command or control as to save and then either click the error or command or on a Mac or

24
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.230
five on a PC.

25
00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.590
Right.

26
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.130
So now we know that we're working with our right documents.

27
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.840
Let's create an HMO file that looks roughly like the example that we had on example dot com.

28
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.940
Now I'm actually going to start with our l tag.

29
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.470
So I noticed that my text editor here nicely predicts what I want to say which is really really handy.

30
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:32.260
So I'm going to select HVM l there and then end the tag and what the text editor also does is creates

31
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.020
an end tag for me because it knows that whenever I need a starting tag I also need an ending tag.

32
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.340
So that's fantastic.

33
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.110
I'll just put a few enters in between those two to give me a nice gap to work with.

34
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.480
Great.

35
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.640
Notice I haven't put the doctype at the top there like we had an example of chrome.

36
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.240
It's not strictly necessary but feel free to add it in if you want to.

37
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.680
It definitely won't do any harm.

38
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.980
Now can you remember the next section that comes in.

39
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.850
A h t m l documents.

40
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.020
It is of course the head.

41
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:14.900
Now notice that I've indented the head that I've done that by pressing the tab button and that just

42
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.240
allows everything to look a little bit nicer and you can then see very quickly that anything that's

43
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.910
been indented here is inside the head section doesn't look right now maybe but when we add a fair bit

44
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.530
of code it will become clear that indenting makes your code look a lot prettier and much much easier

45
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:39.440
to read then do you remember the next section that we had after the head comes the body.

46
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:47.090
So let's end our body tag and then we get our closing buddy tag created automatically for us.

47
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.460
And now we've got the basic structure of our Web page.

48
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.270
So good aged him L and then closing HVM L head closing head and body glazing body.

49
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.340
Fantastic.

50
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.220
What do you think that will look like if we try and actually see it.

51
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.600
I've saved it here and now I'm going to refresh.

52
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.300
It's actually completely empty because we don't have any content here.

53
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.150
So very quick challenge.

54
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.320
Can you add some content which will then appear on this page.

55
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.120
Go for it.

56
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.080
I hope you added the content inside the body section.

57
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.680
So I'm going to indent

58
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:43.290
my text again using tab and then I'm going to save that and refresh there.

59
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.700
My first web page.

60
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.870
Fantastic.

61
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.110
Notice that I haven't used paragraph tags then.

62
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.790
If you did use paragraph tags then Welden but they're not.

63
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.020
Again strictly necessary it will work without them but we'll definitely use them.

64
00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.750
Once we're comfortable with them later on and then my final mini challenge for you is to add a title

65
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.530
to the page.

66
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.000
Can you remember from the last video.

67
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.550
How we do that.

68
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.700
You got it.

69
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.390
It's inside the head section and we just use the tag title like that.

70
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.540
And then we can have whatever title we want.

71
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.190
I'll just call it my web page.

72
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.670
There we go.

73
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.480
And then we'll save that and refresh and you can see the content hasn't actually changed at all.

74
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:38.080
But up here in the tab we can now see my web page and that's as far as we're going to go from now.

75
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:47.150
Other than a little bit of tidying up just so we're not arbitrarily putting in spaces and there we go.

76
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.840
Notice I haven't got the extra metal tags there.

77
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.120
You're very welcome to put them in but I'm going to keep things simple.

78
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.700
They're not absolutely necessary and at this point they don't really add anything to our Web page so

79
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.320
I'm just going to keep what we absolutely need and nothing else.

80
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.370
So there we go.

81
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.420
Your first complete web page.

82
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:13.040
Congratulations in the next video we'll see how we can add a little bit of styling to our page by using

83
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.330
something that we saw in example dot com.

84
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.310
The header tag.
