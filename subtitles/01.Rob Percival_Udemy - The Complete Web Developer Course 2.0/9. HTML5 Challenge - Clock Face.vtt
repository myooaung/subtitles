00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.390
Now that we're familiar with the HVM L5 canvas element we're going to be making a clock so this will

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.040
show us how far we can go with the skills that we learned in the previous video is actually an idea

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.110
that I got from the W3 school's website that I thought was really cool.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.980
And so this is what we're going to be making in this video.

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.590
It does have some reasonably complex math in it.

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.040
So be prepared to watch my video if you haven't done math for quite a while because you do need to work

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:33.390
out some angles and also lengths from say the center to the number one to make the numbers and hands

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.880
appear in the right place.

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.350
But other than that all of the skills are what we covered in the previous video.

10
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.000
So I'll give you a moment to pause the video and try and recreate what you've got in front of you here.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.750
Best of luck.

12
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.480
OK.

13
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.250
Hope you manage to have a good step of that.

14
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.020
So let's start by setting up our canvas

15
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.770
so I'll give it an idea of clock and a with

16
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.290
of five hundred and a height of 500 as well.

17
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.680
And then we'll add scripts.

18
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.420
Let's not forget a quick message

19
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.930
just in case the user is using an old browser.

20
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.390
And then let's create a canvas variable which is going to be document get element by ID

21
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.020
and also how context

22
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.840
is canvas to all get context to the.

23
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.940
I also want a variable to specify the radius of my clock which is simply going to be half the width

24
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.080
of the canvas.

25
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:24.680
So let's use clock radius and we'll put that equal to a canvas dot with divided by C.

26
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:35.250
And because I like to check these things it's just to let the value of the radius get to 50.

27
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.860
Perfect.

28
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.490
All right.

29
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.630
And now let's draw the clock circle.

30
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.300
So we'll do this using context don't begin path.

31
00:02:49.830 --> 00:03:02.990
Then we'll set up our arc and this is going to have a center of clock radius come a clock radius which

32
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.180
is the center of our canvas.

33
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.700
A radius of clock radius and we're going to start at zero and go all the way round.

34
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.210
So 2 times pi

35
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.100
and then we want to draw it.

36
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.650
But this time we don't want to just have an arc.

37
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.030
We want to fill it in.

38
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.880
So we use context dot.

39
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.150
PHIL.

40
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.780
All right let's have a look.

41
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.580
There we go.

42
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.090
That looks good.

43
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.330
Now for the tricky part the numbers.

44
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.880
So we're going to do this with text.

45
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.450
So let's use context.

46
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.130
Funt

47
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:56.250
and let's try making this about a tenth of the radius in terms of pixels we might need to tweak that

48
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.580
a little bit use Let's use clock radius.

49
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.710
Divide it by 10 then plus

50
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.080
pixels and Aeriel and then we'll need to set the Phil style

51
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.560
to white.

52
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.210
And the challenge here is going to be getting the positioning right.

53
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:29.330
I'm going to use to lay out instructions to make my life a little bit easier.

54
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:40.250
First one is text a line which is center so that will make the text aligned at the center of the horizontal

55
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.550
position where I put it.

56
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:51.170
And we can do the same with the vertical position using text baseline is middle.

57
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:57.320
So this will essentially put the text in the center horizontally and vertically of where I put it rather

58
00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.830
than at the bottom left.

59
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.760
And for now we'll just start with the 12.

60
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.870
So let's put that in

61
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:18.460
context of filled text 12 and we'll put it just at the center of a circle for the moment.

62
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:30.670
So that's clock radius comma clock radius and there we get now the 12 of course we want to appear up

63
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:31.260
here.

64
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:40.750
So for the 12 the x coordinate is already correct the y coordinate needs to be decreased by a little

65
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.220
bit less than the clock radius.

66
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:55.540
So I'm going to subtract clock radius times no point nine from that to get it near the top.

67
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.960
All right.

68
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.340
Now that was the easy one.

69
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.260
The tricky one is going to be the next one so the one essentially.

70
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:09.490
So this is where we're going to need math so let's copy what we've got so far.

71
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.630
But this time we want the one.

72
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.960
Now if you imagine a line going from the center of the circle to where we want our one to be that line

73
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.730
has a length of clock radius times no point nine because it's a little bit less than the clock radius.

74
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:33.970
And essentially we want to work out the vertical distance from the center to that point and the horizontal

75
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.440
distance.

76
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.750
And that's why we use sine and cause if you manage to look those up and figure out how to use them then

77
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.830
congratulations.

78
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.260
If not then worry about it.

79
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.820
It's quite mathematically specific.

80
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:56.920
Essentially the up movement is going to be this length multiplied by cause of the angle and the horizontal

81
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:04.770
movement is going to be this length multiplied by the sign of the angle.

82
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.970
So let's try and get that right.

83
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:17.240
So for the horizontal We want to I don't I think I'll make it longer here.

84
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.560
Pluck radius multiplied by.

85
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.950
Here we want math.

86
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.210
Sign of the angle which is

87
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.570
two times math don't pi.

88
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.060
Remember is all the way round.

89
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.230
But we only want to get a twelfth of the way round.

90
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:49.760
So we're going to divide that by 12 and I actually want to multiply picklock clock radius by point nine

91
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:57.410
because I want to go nine tenths of the way out to the numbers rather than to the edge.

92
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.210
So that looks good.

93
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.020
Looks like it's moved it along about the right amount.

94
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.630
We now want to move it down the right amount as well.

95
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:15.050
So it's actually pretty similar to before that instead of subtracting just clock radio times no point

96
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.020
in time which would take it vertically up.

97
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:26.820
We tracked clock radio times no point nine times cause of the angle so that's multiplied by math don't

98
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.470
cause

99
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:43.570
two times math Daube PI divided by 12 because we're dividing the full circle into 12 equal parts.

100
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.950
Phew.

101
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.890
So don't worry too much if you didn't follow all the math going on there.

102
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.720
This is the point at which you should be able to carry on and finish the challenge even if you're not

103
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.970
100 percent clear on how the sign and calls come into the whole thing.

104
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:04.430
All right so obviously we don't want to have 12 different lines of code to do this.

105
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.590
We want to do this with an isolate.

106
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:14.300
So let's use a for loop and we'll start off with I is equal to 1

107
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:23.860
and we want to keep going as long as it is less than or equal to 12.

108
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.090
And we want to increment by one each time

109
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.460
and then we're going to use this line of code.

110
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.560
Where we're going to take instead of 1.

111
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.220
We want to use.

112
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.170
And we're also going to need to increase the angle each time.

113
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:56.920
So we're just going to multiply that by which will take us further and further round the clock.

114
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.730
And similarly here

115
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.310
multiplied by.

116
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.070
All right then fingers crossed.

117
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.280
Let's take a look.

118
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.260
Wonderful.

119
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.710
So now we have a lovely clock face.

120
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:20.280
Now that all remains is the hands I mean I she don't need that 12 anymore either.

121
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.370
So we're going to need to get the time.

122
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.810
Fortunately we can get that from javascript's pretty easily.

123
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:37.570
So we'll gets the number of hours.

124
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.920
We'll do that from a new date.

125
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:50.560
Don't get hours will get minutes.

126
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.990
Which is another new date don't get minutes

127
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.490
and we'll get seconds as well.

128
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.480
Which will be new date

129
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.560
seconds

130
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:09.500
now.

131
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.720
Seconds is pretty straightforward because it's just between 0 and 60 Minutes is also pretty straightforward

132
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.430
because it's between 0 and 60.

133
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:23.360
But ours is not quite that straightforward and that's because not only is it in a 24 hour format but

134
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.280
we also need to incorporate the number of minutes in it as well because we do want to move it around

135
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:33.140
between the three and the fourth say as we get closer and closer to 4 o'clock.

136
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.830
So let's create a variable.

137
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:37.760
For hours

138
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:46.290
and first off we need to get it from a 24 hour to 12 hour.

139
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:54.780
Now the easy way to do that is to take hours and use percent 12 to get the remainder when ours is divided

140
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.860
by 12.

141
00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:00.780
And so if ours is less than 12 it will remain the same if it's more than 12 essentially with subtracting

142
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:11.160
12 from it to get from say 23 to 11 and then we need to add to that the number of minutes which is just

143
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:17.730
minutes divided by 60 because we need to get that in hours.

144
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:28.460
And then for full accuracy we should also do seconds divided by 3600 for number of seconds in an hour.

145
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.780
Next we need to get the angle for each of these.

146
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.230
So let's have a variable hours angle.

147
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:44.920
This is going to be the angle of the hour hand from 12:00 which is actually reasonably straightforward.

148
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:54.090
We just get the number of hours so four hours and then multiply that by the number of angles for one

149
00:12:54.090 --> 00:13:04.320
hour and one hour is two times math dot pi which is all the way round a circle divided by 12 because

150
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.790
its a twelfth of the way round the circle.

151
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:22.330
Similarly with the minutes angle and thats going to be minutes times tee times math PI divided by 12

152
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:39.750
and seconds angle is going to be the same so that just seconds times t times pi divided by 12 and then

153
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.740
to draw say the hour hand we'll use context.

154
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.690
Don't move to.

155
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:55.970
And then we want to start at the center of the circle which is clock radius come our clock radius.

156
00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:05.170
So halfway along half way down and then we won't see draw a line too.

157
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.390
And this is the tricky bit again.

158
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.710
So I'll expand outwards.

159
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.110
Essentially we're going to want the same thing that we had here.

160
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:26.010
So on the horizontal we want exactly the same as that except instead of moving this angle around we

161
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.680
want to move the angle around.

162
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.610
And then the y coordinates we want to

163
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.060
use again the same as before.

164
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:50.430
So a clock radio to get to the center minus clock radio times no point nine times cause of the angle.

165
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:56.870
So how is angle.

166
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.240
And then we want to draw the line.

167
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.130
So context don't strike

168
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.650
a couple of quick things there.

169
00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.990
Firstly I think I've missed a bracket off.

170
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.090
And we also need to set the stroke style

171
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.710
because otherwise it's going to be black so we won't see it on top of the face.

172
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:34.060
So I just said it to white and one more quick change as well.

173
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:46.800
I think we'll need to have a variable for the date rather than grab the hours minutes and seconds directly

174
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.110
from the new Date function and the small things.

175
00:15:52.110 --> 00:16:02.130
Well I've forgotten the brackets after these functions Papazian and I've just noticed there but I've

176
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.760
got content rather than context.

177
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.100
Not my finest hour but there we go.

178
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.860
Let's run it and give it a shot.

179
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.520
There we go.

180
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.290
That's looking good.

181
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.400
And that is about the right times 2:51 here.

182
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:20.610
So a couple of things we didn't want to make that a little bit shorter in fact the our hand is usually

183
00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.770
quite a bit shorter.

184
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:28.980
So let's make that about four point six.

185
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.160
And I think a little bit thicker as well.

186
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.890
So well use context it's line with

187
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.460
let's say five.

188
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.490
See how that looks.

189
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.470
Ok I'm pretty happy with that.

190
00:16:48.010 --> 00:17:00.820
Let's add in now the minute hand so is all of this code again this time we'll make it a little bit thinner.

191
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.960
A little bit longer.

192
00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.270
And will change.

193
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.550
Well maybe point actually.

194
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.750
And we'll change how is angle.

195
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:20.830
Two minutes angle and here as well.

196
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.100
All right.

197
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.070
Let's take a look.

198
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.110
OK that's looking good.

199
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:27.360
And then

200
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.650
we'll do the same for the second hand.

201
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.890
So make it a bit nicer again.

202
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.960
And then we want seconds and go

203
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.680
and seconds angle

204
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:52.600
and there we go.

205
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:57.240
I think I'll just make the seconds and go line a little bit longer.

206
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.670
So maybe we'll go all the way out.

207
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.820
Two point nine lovely.

208
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.000
And then before we make the clock work I think it looks a little bit ugly in the middle there.

209
00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.370
So I'm just going to add a small circle in the middle.

210
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.810
To tidy that up attach.

211
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.490
So let's add a another path.

212
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.910
And then have an arc

213
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:31.690
and let's just try 20 pixels and we'll need the fill style to be white at that point.

214
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.360
So actually I can move that up

215
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:41.760
here too before we do that circle.

216
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.350
So let's take a look.

217
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.060
There we go.

218
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.240
That does look a little bit tight.

219
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.780
Yes.

220
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.100
I think I'll just make it a bit smaller.

221
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:54.020
Maybe 10 that will get much better.

222
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.920
I've just noticed something slightly strange with our hands.

223
00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.220
They do pop all over the place a little bit.

224
00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:10.780
I think that's because even though there are 12 hours in a full turn there are 16 minutes and of course

225
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.220
60 seconds

226
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.590
say that looks so much better

227
00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.100
prelim.

228
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:32.050
So all that remains is to get this to update every second rather than just when the page is refreshed.

229
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.820
But that's easily done.

230
00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:41.870
What we need to do is set this whole thing up as a function.

231
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:44.640
So you might call it set time

232
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.480
and then we want that function to be called every second.

233
00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:04.280
So we use set interval and then set time every 1000 milliseconds.

234
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:13.020
And one final change that we'll need there is to set the Phil style tea black

235
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.980
just before the clock face is drawn.

236
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:30.770
Otherwise it will still be white from drawing the hands OK let's have a look.

237
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.160
It's looking great.

238
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:40.940
Fantastic.

239
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.830
That takes us to the end of the canvas challenge.

240
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.960
But now we're going to move on to just assorted HCM L5 cool features that we can use in our web sites

241
00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.050
before we look in a bit more detail at CSSA 3.
