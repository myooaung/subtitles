00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.440
In this section we'll be looking at HCM of 5 and CSSA 3 although all the TNL that we've looked at in

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.290
this course is HVM L5 compatible.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.950
There are a number of specific HCM L5 and see it has three features that are worth looking at in detail

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.250
in themselves.

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.550
Tim L5 in particular brought a new level of interactivity and power to the browser.

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.480
And in this section I'm going to show you how to take advantage of that.

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.160
We'll be looking at some of the ways you can use HD L5 to make your forms more powerful and user friendly.

8
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.410
We'll see how we can integrate video and audio very easily into our websites with each team of five.

9
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.090
We'll look at the new canvas tag which allows you to essentially draw onto the screen very easily and

10
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.210
we'll finish with a quick run through of some of the other best features of HVM L5 when you're working

11
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.290
with Tim L5 and these new advanced features.

12
00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.900
It's worth being aware of which browsers can support the features that you're using.

13
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:10.420
So I'd recommend using a Web site called Can I use dot com which has a list of all of the latest features

14
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.300
within HVM L5 and CSSA 3 and shows the browser support for them.

15
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:24.370
So if we're going to use the canvas tag for example then we should be aware that we're pretty safe with

16
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.930
the latest versions of most of the browsers.

17
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.340
Opera Mini is going to be our only major problem and I might as well.

18
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.060
Going to be an issue.

19
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.810
So 1 percent of users might struggle but that's probably worth it for the extra features that canvas

20
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.420
can bring.

21
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.560
So I hope you're excited about the potential for HDMI L5 to enhance your sites and make them look great

22
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.100
and be more powerful and interactive for your users.

23
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.890
We're going to start by looking at how HCM L5 can enhance forms in the next video.
