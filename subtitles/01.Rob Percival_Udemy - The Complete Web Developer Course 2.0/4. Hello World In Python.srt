1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,940
Getting started with Python is very very slightly more complicated than with HP but will still only

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,810
take a couple of minutes.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,740
So I'm going to go back over to fire after you pay to connect to my web server and when I'm connected

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,010
I'm going to be in the root of the web server which we saw right back at the beginning of the course.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,920
And then you remember that we normally put our web based files in public HTL but our Python scripts

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,400
actually go in this folder called cgi bin.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,280
CGI is short for common Gateway Interface but essentially these cgi bin is a place to put scripts that's

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,410
all going to be called by a client computer or a browser and then communicate with your web server.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,570
And of course then likely send something back as well.

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,440
So this is where we're going to put all of our Python scripts.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:01:02,250
So I'm going to start by control clicking and create file and I'm going to start with Hello World dot

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,140
and then the python extension is dot p.

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,700
Y.

14
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:13,070
And then I'm going to open that up by clicking command in brackets.

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,130
Remember you need to associate the dot p y extension with your text editor to be able to do that.

16
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,870
If you can't remember how to do it then go back to that how do I set up FTB section and watch that video

17
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,600
for your operating system.

18
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,490
All right but now you're here.

19
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:38,050
You'll remember that BHP had a symbol like that that said Right we're going to start doing ph Peeno

20
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,670
Python doesn't quite have that.

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,750
Because if we're in a python file everything we write is going to be python but it does have what's

22
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:53,560
known as a sheer bank line which is essentially a line that tells the python script where the Python

23
00:01:53,620 --> 00:02:00,310
interpreter is on the server and the Python interpreter is essentially a bit of software that will process

24
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,780
the Python and then do what it says.

25
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:12,670
And on a web hosting service we use the standard shebang line which is a hash and then an exclamation

26
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:24,160
mark and then the location is slash use the US all slash bin slash Python.

27
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,020
So don't worry too much about that.

28
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:33,760
Essentially what that saying is that this is the location of the Python processing scripts on this particular

29
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,470
server.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,440
And that's a pretty standard location.

31
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,710
All right.

32
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,370
Once we set that up we want to tell Python to do something.

33
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:49,060
So the thing that I obviously wanted to do is to print hello world and doing that is pretty straightforward.

34
00:02:49,410 --> 00:03:00,830
We use print rather than Ekho as we did in THP And then as before we just put the string that we want

35
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:10,300
to print in quites like with javascript I can use semi-colons on the end but it's usually discouraged

36
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,470
in Python.

37
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,490
So we just use line breaks to our commands.

38
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:22,300
So this is a valid command but it won't actually work as a Python script on a web server because we

39
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:32,110
need to tell it first that we want to output some TNL and we do that with another print command which

40
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:42,940
is print and then content type text slash HLL.

41
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,440
And this essentially tells the Python interpreter that we want to output some text or channel and then

42
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,330
we just need to print a line break or a blank line essentially.

43
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,420
So we just use print and then an empty string.

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,480
All right we're almost there.

45
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,660
I'm just going to say that and then I'll show you what happens if we try and run this script as it is.

46
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:16,520
Now we access that script using complete web developer caused dot com slash cgi bin.

47
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,560
And then the file name which is hello world dot p y.

48
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,690
So if we access it now we get a file permissions error so permissions is not something we've looked

49
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,330
at yet but it's a good opportunity to do that.

50
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,370
You may have noticed when you've been using fire FGP that when you control click or right click on a

51
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:46,230
file there's an option to select Properties and properties is another word for permissions.

52
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:53,800
In this case and you can see here that we've got a number of different permissions which essentially

53
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,110
control what can be done with this script.

54
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,700
And we've got three that we should be interested in here.

55
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,250
Read write and execute.

56
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,930
So we set it up so that anyone can read this script which is good that's what we want.

57
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,490
Only the owner of the script can write to it.

58
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,060
That's again what we want.

59
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:19,480
But at the moment no one can execute the script but we want anyone to be able to go to the U R L and

60
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,690
execute the script.

61
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,560
So we just need to select those three boxes.

62
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,340
And that gives us a permission number of 7 5 5.

63
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:35,560
You can play with the selecting and selecting these options to see what effect it has on the number

64
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,140
that the number is just essentially a shortcut to get to the box takings.

65
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,110
So 7 5 5 is what you want for your Python scripts on a web server.

66
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:56,030
And now if we go back to crime and refresh the page we should finally get our Python Hello world.

67
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,450
Fantastics and now we're up and running with our Python script.

68
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,580
We're going to start running through the basics of Python programming and we're going to do that starting

69
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,900
with variables and arrays.
