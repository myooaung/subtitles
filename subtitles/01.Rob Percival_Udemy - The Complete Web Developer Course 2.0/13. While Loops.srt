1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:07,140
So alongside the for loop we have the while loop which has hopefully you remember from the javascript

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,810
section of the Course is just really another way to achieve the same thing but because of the different

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,690
way that it's set up might be more useful in different circumstances.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:26,220
So let's take a look with the While loop will set up an initial variable outside of the loop and then

5
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,480
we do a loop while something is true.

6
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,230
So if we were going to do the same thing that we did before we would keep going as long as I is less

7
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:45,150
than 10 then we have our brackets to denote what we can do as long as it is less than 10.

8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,310
And very importantly we have to remember to increment each time if we don't do that it will just go

9
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,390
on forever and ever.

10
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,580
And then we just put our code that we want to happen here.

11
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,200
We get let's have a look.

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,560
So that does exactly the same thing as we did before.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,800
So here's a quick while the challenge for you.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,220
Can you use a while loop to display the first 10 items the first 10 numbers in the five times table

15
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,010
OK.

16
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,360
Did you manage it.

17
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,600
So the first item in the five times table is five.

18
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:41,950
And we want to keep going as long as I is less than or equal to the tenth item which is 50 and instead

19
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,640
of adding 1 to each time we're going to add I going to set.

20
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,950
I'd say I plus five we get let's have a look that should do it.

21
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,310
Fantastic.

22
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,070
You may have done it another way as well.

23
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:06,750
If we actually just use Undo to go back to what we had before we could actually use that code but set

24
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,820
the initial value to 1.

25
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,220
We want the first 10 items in the times table.

26
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,950
But then if we don't display I instead we calculate say a J.

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:28,720
Which is I multiplied by 5 and then we just display that and that should give us the exact same thing

28
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,180
that we got.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,310
So well done if you solved it that way as well.

30
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,970
That's a good solution.

31
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,580
All right.

32
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,610
Second challenge then can you create an array any four items you like.

33
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,750
You know what I'm going to choose and then use a while loop to display each of the values in that array.

34
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,690
If you can figure out how to do it.

35
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,300
Good luck.

36
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,360
OK.

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,570
How do you manage that.

38
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,940
We show you how I would have done it.

39
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,870
So let's have our good out family right.

40
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:21,860
It's going to be an array with for all our favorite characters Kirsten Tommy and Ralph and then we're

41
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,030
going to set up our counter again.

42
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,070
We're going to start at zero because we'll start with the zero item in the array.

43
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:37,370
And we want to keep going as long as I is less than the number of items in the array.

44
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,790
We know how to get that size of.

45
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,550
And then there right

46
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,960
whenever I'm doing a while loop.

47
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,790
I always do the plus plus before I do anything else.

48
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,050
Otherwise I forget it.

49
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,730
And then I try and run my code and then it crashes or does something horrendous.

50
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:05,640
So then all we need to do is to display each item which we get from family string.

51
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,050
I let's put a line break in as well.

52
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,590
There we go.

53
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,240
So that's how we use a while loop loop through an array.

54
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:24,470
You can see though I think that the foreach loop is the simplest way to do that and that's it.

55
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,670
So that's all we need to know about while loops.

56
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:33,380
For now we're now heading toward the two big challenges for this section and for those we'll need a

57
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,430
way of interacting with the user.

58
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,580
So you notice so far all of the people have written it's not been interactive use couldn't do anything

59
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,360
to change the output of this.

60
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:49,760
So to make interactive scripts using HP we need a way to pass information from the Web site to the server

61
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,150
and we're going to see two different ways to do that in the next two videos.

62
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,460
The first of which is using GET variables.
