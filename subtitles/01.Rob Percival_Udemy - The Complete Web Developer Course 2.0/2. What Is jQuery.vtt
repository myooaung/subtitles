00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.230
So we've covered HVM L which allows us to control the content of a page.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.780
We've looked at CSSA which allows us to control the styles of that page and then we've looked at javascript

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.820
which allows us to make that page interactive and enables us to control it using code.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.060
So what extra Does Jay queery do for us.

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.630
Well as I mentioned Jaker is a javascript framework that means it sits on top of javascript and its

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.940
main purpose is to make things that are a little bit complicated on Javascript a lot simpler.

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.350
And essentially it gives us a lot more power with a lot less code which makes writing interactive powerful

8
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.570
web sites a lot easier.

9
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.400
There are a number of other javascript frameworks out there but Jay query is by far the most popular

10
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.620
and the one you'll come across most often said this is the one that we're going to focus on in the complete

11
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.370
web developer of course.

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.000
It also has a bunch of plugins which allow you to do really cool stuff really easily.

13
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.710
And I'm going to show you just a few of them now to get you excited about learning Jay Querrey.

14
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.100
So one that we'll be spending quite a lot of time with is the official Jay queery UI again which makes

15
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.780
it really easy to do things like make objects trackable or indeed drawable.

16
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.640
So you can drop things on top of others and then do something when that happens.

17
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:30.950
You can create things like data pictures very easily and very commonly use things like progress bars.

18
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.830
So that's a great start but there's a lot more as well.

19
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.920
There are pool to refresh plugins so you'll be familiar with that if you've used an iPhone and you want

20
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.340
to refresh the content of a page you can just pull it down.

21
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.970
And this plugin provides exactly that by pulling down you can see it's refreshing the content of the

22
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.330
page that the rubber band is another great Jake where we plug in we've got tool tips plug ins like tool

23
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.370
tip stuff tool tips are really handy hover Avas

24
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.250
that you can use to give extra information on your apps.

25
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.160
And to the fancy things like that.

26
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.000
We've got the magnificent Pop-Pop plugin which is a rather grand name for something that's really useful

27
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.030
so if you've got images that you can just tap on them and have them appear nice and large that's something

28
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.320
that you're probably going to want to do quite regularly.

29
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.990
We've got things like an slider which gives the slide out which is very commonly used on Web sites these

30
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.350
days particularly a big jumbotron as it's known at the very top of the page.

31
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.600
And finally type a dot.

32
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.370
You'll be familiar with this sort of thing.

33
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:57.320
If you've ever used google and it simply allows you to autocomplete the contents of a search box.

34
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.990
There you go.

35
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.070
And that's really useful as well.

36
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.570
So Jake where it makes a lot of things a lot easier to program than javascript alone and it's got a

37
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.600
huge range of free plug ins that you can use to give really quite advanced features to your websites

38
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.390
very easily.

39
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.700
So excited to get started.

40
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.780
We'll do that straightaway in the next video.
