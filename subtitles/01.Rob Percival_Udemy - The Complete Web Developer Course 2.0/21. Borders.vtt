1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:00.900
All right.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.960
So we're now moving on from padding and margins to borders.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:11.450
So looking at how we can give borders to our elements and what different styles we can use.

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.740
All right.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.750
Before we do that I'm going to give you a quick challenge because everything is getting a little bit

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.900
complex here.

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.250
So to make it easier just to work with borders I'm going to reset everything back to zero.

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:32.370
And then I'd like you to create using just divs three squares 100 pixels wide and 100 pixels high and

9
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:47.720
make them red blue and green three squares and pixels by a hundred pixels and red blue and green different.

10
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.800
All right type you managed it.

11
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.550
I'm going to start with the h t m l

12
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.240
and all we're going to need here is Dave's with ID's.

13
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.760
I'm going to use IDs because it's only going to be one of each of them and I'm going to call the first

14
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.340
one square dash red

15
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.140
and then

16
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.380
another one will be square dash blue

17
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:30.830
and the third will be you've guessed it square dash green.

18
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.390
OK.

19
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.050
So obviously if we look at that there's nothing there because there's no content but we can add some

20
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.100
styling to our device which will make them appear.

21
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.550
So let's start with square dash red.

22
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.440
So the main thing we need here is a background color of red.

23
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:12.240
That will also need a width of 100 pixels and a height power of 100 pixels that we get wonderful.

24
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.990
There's are Red Square.

25
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.650
So let's copy and paste that for our blue and green squares.

26
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.320
Now they're going to be exactly the same

27
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.340
except of course going to be Billy

28
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.000
and green have a look.

29
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080
There we go.

30
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.880
So we've solved the problem but it's not particularly elegant.

31
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.920
If I wanted to change the size of all three of these squares as I might want to do then I'd have to

32
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.770
update all of those.

33
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.600
Similarly I don't quite like the fact that they're attached.

34
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.410
I'd like to add margins to them but I'd have to do that separately for all three.

35
00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.120
Which is not a great way to set up our page because it requires a lot of work to update it.

36
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:12.990
So what I'm going to do is add a class of square to each of these divs and then I'm going to put anything

37
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:21.860
that's common to all three of them into that square styling.

38
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.450
So the main thing that's come into all of them is the width and the height.

39
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.950
So I'm going to put that in there.

40
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.750
And then I can get rid of it for everywhere else.

41
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.550
All right.

42
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.120
So let's have a look.

43
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.440
Excellent it's still exactly the same as it was before but we now have two big advantages.

44
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.330
One is that we have less code than we had before.

45
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.100
We're probably just about the bigger one is that I can now update these squares with just one.

46
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.710
Yes s styling.

47
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.990
So as I mentioned I'm going to add a little bit of a margin.

48
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.150
Let's try 10 pixels just to spread them out a little bit.

49
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.970
Yeah I think that looks better.

50
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.110
Maybe even for something like 40 pixels.

51
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.010
Yeah.

52
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.360
I'm also going to have them along the top for no particular reason that I think that looks a little

53
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:25.650
bit nicer and I can do that really easily by just setting them all to flight left.

54
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.130
There we go.

55
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.790
Brilliant.

56
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.400
So I hope you manage that challenge.

57
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.430
But also I hope it was useful to see the advantage of using IDS in some cases but classes in another

58
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.420
to keep your code nice and easily updateable and changeable.

59
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.850
All right so now on to borders.

60
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.680
So I'm going to do different boards for each of these boxes and we'll start off with a nice straightforward

61
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:59.060
one for read and we'll have a one pixel black border and we do that by setting up a border property

62
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.590
and then we have to specify three things so the width of the border.

63
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:13.250
First off site one pixel in this case then the color of the border so black in this case and then the

64
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.390
style of the border.

65
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.470
And I'm going to use solid

66
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.040
again.

67
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.280
So you can hopefully just about see that as make it a little bit thicker.

68
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.600
So it will go for 10 pixels.

69
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.620
And now you can really see it clearly there.

70
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.870
So obviously you can change any of those.

71
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.020
We could have a nice yellow border can change with as we already have.

72
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.470
And we can change the type as well.

73
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.490
And if we want to get

74
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:55.960
a list of the different types we can have just google border styles and then click on the top result

75
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.210
and you can see we've got solid which is the one we've already used.

76
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:06.550
But if you scroll down and you can see all these different ones here dotted dashed double groove ridge.

77
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.680
So you can try on all of these out

78
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.450
and have a look at double.

79
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.600
Yes.

80
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.770
So it sort of goes yellow then red and yellow.

81
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.680
We can have dasht as well

82
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.950
which creates this dasht effect.

83
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.590
And you're welcome to try out the other ones.

84
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.300
To be honest I do use the different border styles very often.

85
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.280
So that is about all I regularly go for.

86
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.550
OK.

87
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.330
Now we can do much more complicated things than that if we want to.

88
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:51.680
So if we want to set for example the border to be different top left bottom and right we can do that

89
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:59.390
using border and then the various different options so if we wanted to have a different style on top

90
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.270
left bottom right.

91
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:06.110
I've no idea why we would do that but we might have bought a style and then let's say start off with

92
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:16.520
a rigid one then a solid then dotted and then dashed and just with margins and padding.

93
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.480
This will be the top one.

94
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.490
And then right and then bottom and left.

95
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.790
So let's have a look see what horrendous border we're creating here.

96
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.440
You can see we've got some defaults of black and a certain weight.

97
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.170
I think that's about three pixels but a different style on each one.

98
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.910
So here's a challenge for you.

99
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:40.840
Can you create it so that that's a different color on the top right bottom and left as well.

100
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.360
Go for it.

101
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.060
Did you manage it.

102
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.720
It's pretty similar.

103
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:56.710
We just use border color and then we could have green.

104
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:09.800
And then let's use a few of these example ones green beige pink and pale golden rule that sounds good

105
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:13.390
wonderful.

106
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:18.540
So now we've got different colors it's looking horrendous but it's a good example of what we're capable

107
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.560
of.

108
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:25.950
And then finally I'll just set a different with for each one as well and we'll do that with border with

109
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:34.590
and we'll have 10 pixels five pixels to pixels and one pixel

110
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.320
and then we get that looks pretty horrendous but it's pretty powerful as well.

111
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:47.720
I'm really customize this as much as we want and just like with margins and paddings you could set this

112
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:57.030
one by one using for example border left color border lifestyle et cetera.

113
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:07.670
All right so finally look at a much nicer use of borders and this is a border radius so rounded rectangles

114
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.100
are still all the rage.

115
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:19.140
And they're really easy to create using Borda radius so strictly speaking this isn't really a border

116
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:19.980
at all.

117
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:26.090
But let's have a look and let's make it a little bit bigger than that of a 20 pixel border radius.

118
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:33.630
What that will do it doesn't actually add a border a tool but it adds a radius to the edge of our square

119
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.260
which unlike our second example there.

120
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.610
And really the first one too does look quite aesthetically pleasing.

121
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.630
So I'd recommend getting bored radius into your toolkit as a web developer.

122
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:50.580
Final quick border radius challenge then could you change this border radius style so that it creates

123
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.480
a circle from the square and bonus points if you can do it two different ways.

124
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:56.870
Everett

125
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:02.680
All right.

126
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.150
Hope you manage that.

127
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:10.390
What we need to do is set the border radius to half of the width of our square.

128
00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.110
So the square is 100 pixels.

129
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:18.790
So if we set the border radius to 50 pixels then the border radius effectively goes all the way from

130
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.630
the middle of the top to the middle of the right.

131
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:29.740
So we get a lovely circle the other way to do it would be to set the border radius to 50 percent.

132
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:34.930
And the advantage of doing it that way is then it will be a circle regardless of the size because the

133
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:39.400
border radius will always be half of whatever the width of the div is.

134
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:49.810
So if we change the width of all of these for example to be 400 pixels then you can see it stretches

135
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.290
out the border radius all the way.

136
00:10:52.660 --> 00:11:01.550
And if the height was 400 pixels as well then we'd get a really nice big circle.

137
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:06.050
So you can use Boulder radius to create circles out of squares.

138
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.920
Wonderful.

139
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:13.160
So we're now coming to the end of our CSI section but we have a couple of videos before our big CSSA

140
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.040
project where we're going to clone the BBC News website.

141
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.650
And those last few videos are going to focus on styling text with CSSA.
