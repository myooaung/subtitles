00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.530
Before HVM L5 the only way to play video and audio on your sites was to use some sort of a plugin with

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.550
HVM L5 adding and controlling video and audio is extremely easy.

3
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.370
Before we can do that though we will need to download some video and audio.

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:27.060
So I would just do a quick quick google for sample video and I like the Web site sample videos dot com

5
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.920
which does exactly what you think it might do.

6
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:40.160
And for video I would recommend before this has got the most browsers support of all the file formats.

7
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:48.520
So I'm going to click download for that first one and can save it in the same folder as my main file

8
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.810
and I'll just call it

9
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.510
video.

10
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.570
And while we're here we'll download some audio as well.

11
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.860
Again MP3 is the best antidote to use in my opinion because it's the only one supported by all the major

12
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.780
powerhouses.

13
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.610
I'll just call that Woody Guthrie.

14
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:23.130
So let's get rid of all of the phone code and see how we add video to IDM l page.

15
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:33.970
So as I've said it's super easy we just use the video tag with a certain width.

16
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:48.440
OK for 320 and a height of 240 and then we need to do is specify a source for the video.

17
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.370
And we do that using an SIRC of video.

18
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.550
And before we specify the type as well

19
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.010
so the Taipei's video slash.

20
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.570
And before you can even specify multiple sources if you want to be absolutely sure that you're maximizing

21
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.900
browser compatibility with people you should be pretty safe.

22
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.820
You can also add some text which will appear if the user's browser doesn't support this type of video.

23
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.460
I'll just put.

24
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.830
Please upgrade your browser.

25
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.460
All right then that's public.

26
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.350
So there's the video Fortunately though we can't do anything with it.

27
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.610
That's because without specifying controls we don't get given any controls.

28
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.740
So let's try now.

29
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.370
There we go.

30
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.810
That looks a bit better.

31
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.830
And we can play the video right back.

32
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.660
All the controls are going to be different from browser to browser.

33
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.050
Usually that will have a full screen option

34
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.960
like that and volume controls and slide controls as well.

35
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.390
We can also use the auto play attributes to do what you might think make the video auto play.

36
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.530
So if we were really cruel to our users we might turn off the controls and also play the video.

37
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.610
That might work quite well but the soundless video that form the backdrop of a hero on your page for

38
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.990
example.

39
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.860
But normally we're going to want to give the users some controls.

40
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.940
That's pretty much all there is to it.

41
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.430
But we can also interact with the video using javascript.

42
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.160
And I'll just show you the basics of how we might do that here.

43
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.500
So let's add a bit of javascript's.

44
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.340
One thing to note in HMO five as well is that you don't have to specify a type for your script tags

45
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.820
anymore.

46
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.520
I think it's generally a good idea but it's not part of the HTML5 specification so we can just leave

47
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.720
it like that.

48
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.180
So let's say we wanted our own button which started the video.

49
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.730
So let's just get rid of what I play for the moment.

50
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.230
So underneath the PDA we might have a button with an ID of play

51
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.030
which has the word play on it.

52
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.280
So obviously that won't do anything at the moment but let's write some javascript to get some interaction

53
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.730
with it.

54
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:51.740
So we'll use the good old get element by ID to grab our play button and we want to add an on click to

55
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.150
that which is a function

56
00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.260
which will be contained here.

57
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:07.690
And as usual I'll do a quick check just to make sure everything is linked up again.

58
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.870
So how do we make the video play.

59
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.440
It's pretty easy.

60
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.980
We need to first get the video an I.D. so I'll give it I.D. of video.

61
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.540
And then again we use document talks.

62
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:31.030
I don't buy I.D. video and then we just simply use play

63
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.730
simple as that.

64
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.280
So let's see it in action and we get

65
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.940
a quick challenge for you.

66
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.750
Can you make it not just a play button but a button which either plays or pauses the video depending

67
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.590
on whether it's currently paused or playing airfreight

68
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.060
or you may have had a little bit of googling there to figure out how to do it.

69
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.020
But it's pretty straightforward.

70
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:19.780
We do a check to see if document dog get element by id video and then paused

71
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.340
if that's the case.

72
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.540
We'll play it.

73
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.790
If it's not

74
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.280
and

75
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.390
I'll pause it.

76
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.650
So let's have a look.

77
00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:52.760
I play pause play pause and just be a little bit more fancy as well.

78
00:06:53.130 --> 00:07:08.090
If we're making it play and we'll set this thoughts in a HMO is equal to a pause.

79
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:14.520
And similarly here they start in each t l is equal t play.

80
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.890
Just so our play button updates

81
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.580
quite.

82
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.910
One more thing before we move on to Odeo.

83
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.940
So that's pretty much all you need to know about including video and your web sites and you can probably

84
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.570
guess what the process is for including podia.

85
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.160
It works in pretty much the same way.

86
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.050
So let's check it out.

87
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.100
So instead of a video tag we have an idea tag.

88
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.120
We don't necessarily need a whit than a height here.

89
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.820
So we might just want to have an audio tag with controls.

90
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:54.720
And then as before we specify the source.

91
00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:02.470
In our case it's going to be Audioboo MP 3 on a small HCM him L5 comment here is that you no longer

92
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:08.830
need the quotes around attribute values like that.

93
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.050
I quite like putting them in.

94
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.650
I think it makes things a little bit clearer but it's a team of 5 you don't need them.

95
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.330
I mean you specify the type again.

96
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:27.410
So this is MP 3 so we use all Deodhar MPEG.

97
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.950
And then once again we'll add a message

98
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:39.130
talk great that browser if it doesn't work.

99
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.820
And here we go.

100
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.000
So I should play video.

101
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:46.290
It is

102
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.710
wonderful.

103
00:08:51.960 --> 00:09:02.050
And note that if we take out the controls and put auto play in there we can again very crudely just

104
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.280
also play the sound

105
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.050
without any way of stopping it.

106
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.270
So let's not do that.

107
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.350
That's better.

108
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:20.680
And that's it you can use exactly the same javascript instructions to add play pause et cetera.

109
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:26.920
But I'm sure you can figure out how to do that based on this code if you need to.

110
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.420
It's a very very simple.

111
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:35.510
We just use the video tag or the audio tag with a few options to play video and audio and your web sites.

112
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.920
I hope your head is buzzing with ideas about how you might use that but we're going to go on and see

113
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.500
perhaps the most famous HVM L5 tag.

114
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.030
And that is canvas.
