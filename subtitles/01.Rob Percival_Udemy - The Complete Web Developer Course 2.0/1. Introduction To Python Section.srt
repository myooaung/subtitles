00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,800
Welcome to Section 13 of the complete web developer course I hope you enjoyed working with a team of

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,530
5 and CSSA three and seeing some of the great features that we can use from those in our web sites and

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,200
web apps in this section we're going to return it to a server side language and we're going to be looking

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,480
specifically at Python.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,630
Python is a great language for new coders to learn because it's so clean and well-thought-out.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,030
We can also use it on a huge range of different platforms that works on a web server but you can also

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:40,110
use it on say a Raspberry Pi or an order window to allow you to build Internet of things experiences

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,760
for your users.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,950
So it should be pretty straightforward to get to grips with.

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,960
We'll start with the basics of how Python works and how you get a Python script up and running and then

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:54,630
we'll go on to look at some of the specific Python features and we'll be making a fun game with Python

12
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,380
as well.

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,190
So enjoy the section and as always I'll see at the beginning of the next one.
