1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,140
Get them.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:09,290
So I'm going to begin by just adding my e-mail input and e-mail label and styling those so that everything

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,070
looks like I want it to.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:19,770
So I did mention that there are things that we can use labels which attach themselves to inputs.

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,480
So let's do a quick google for something like labels for inputs HTL.

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,230
OK the label tag that looks like what we might want

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,570
OK.

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,260
And there we go.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:45,530
So looks like I can use a label to just attach myself or touch my label specifically to an input.

10
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,920
All right so we've pasted that in.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,640
Let's update things.

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:01:00,310
So the label is connected to the input itself virus ID those other things that are matching them.

13
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,340
So I'm going to change my label to e-mail.

14
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,570
And All right e-mail is the name for the label itself as well.

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,840
This is going to be a radio.

16
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,560
This is going to be a text input will have the name being e-mail as well.

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,970
The idea being e-mail and I don't want an initial Valley so I'm going to get rid of that.

18
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:31,860
But I will have a placeholder because I think they usually look nice e.g. your name at gmail dot com

19
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,940
something like that.

20
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,640
All right let's take a look.

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,070
OK.

22
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,130
Not a bad start.

23
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,070
We definitely want to do a fair bit of styling on this day.

24
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,220
First off let's change our phones.

25
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,160
For everything to a nice sunset font

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:04,060
I'll go for Helvetica and then sans serif.

27
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,990
If that fails I've forgotten to put my style tagging them

28
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,300
Enrique and

29
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,100
and then.

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,400
So that should change the fun for everything to help get to.

31
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,790
But only if I put a comma in between those two.

32
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,140
Great.

33
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,000
Next I want to make everything a fair bit bigger.

34
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,450
So let's try a font size of 300 percent.

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,390
Little bit too large

36
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,240
200 percent.

37
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,470
That'll do.

38
00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:02,950
Next I want to style my inputs so let's add in some input styling.

39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:12,250
We'll start off with a height of let's try 40 pixels.

40
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,900
See how that looks.

41
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,810
I think that's about right.

42
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,800
Not quite aligned correctly but maybe a little bit taller.

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,150
But actually I also want some padding so I'm going to put 5 pixels of padding in and that should make

44
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,770
it a little different.

45
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,150
And I also want a larger font size.

46
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:39,580
So let's go for a font size of has a height of 40 pixels 30 pixels.

47
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,630
Sounds about right.

48
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,370
Yeah a little large I think.

49
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,900
Maybe 25.

50
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,660
OK that looks more reasonable.

51
00:03:49,660 --> 00:04:00,750
I would like some rounded corners in that say I'm going to add a border radius of let's try 5 pixels

52
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,100
OK.

53
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:11,150
That's nice but I don't quite like this sort of phony 3D effects them so I'm going to set the border

54
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,340
to the one VX solid gray.

55
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,850
OK that's a bit neater.

56
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:27,020
I don't like the centering in the vertical centering of the text so I'm going to get rid of that height

57
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,400
and adjust the padding so I like the amount of padding on the top.

58
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,190
I won't have the same amount on the bottom and it's not quite centering that for me.

59
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:46,370
So I'm going to go for 5 x 5 x and then let's try 15 x on the bottom to give it a bit more padding there.

60
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:54,300
OK that's good but I think I've got a little bit too much so let's try 10 K.

61
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,940
Just a touch more.

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,520
There we go.

63
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:10,700
OK I'm liking that we do need a bit more with Thome So let's try 300 pixels for hour with maybe even

64
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,240
a touch more

65
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,800
try 3.

66
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,800
20.

67
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,060
OK now I think my

68
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,870
label is a little bit large so I'll actually make that much smaller.

69
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,080
And I also want to shift it down a little bit.

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:41,500
It's not quite centered vertically with the input that are going to style my labels you should indent

71
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,040
everything else a little bit.

72
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:55,760
So I will do this with relative positioning and give it a top of maybe 7 pixels.

73
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,900
See how that looks.

74
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,690
But too much

75
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,370
for pixels.

76
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,160
There we get great.

77
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:10,150
I'd like to censor everything in the page so you may remember how we do that from

78
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,260
big CSSA project we have some kind of container or wrapper div

79
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,150
doesn't matter too much what you call it.

80
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,140
Important Thing other styles that you give it

81
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,510
say let's

82
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,190
give it a fixed width

83
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:52,980
try 500 pixels initially and then a margin as you may remember zero for top and bottom and auto left

84
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:03,270
and right and that will then center everything in the middle of the page OK.

85
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,790
We adjust our styling a little bit as we go.

86
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,250
But let's start off with that and see how it works.

87
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,960
OK so now we've got our e-mail label.

88
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,800
Let's add our telephone

89
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,040
label.

90
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:37,010
So we'll call it telephone and it's still going to be text and we'll give it a name of an ideal of an

91
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:46,080
idea of phone and an EEG of one two three four five six seven eight nine.

92
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,560
Important thing is there's no spaces in there.

93
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,460
So let's have a look.

94
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,410
OK.

95
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,890
That looks good but you can see that these labels have different widths.

96
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,010
So let's try and fix that.

97
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,810
We should come across an interesting little issue.

98
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:16,250
So if I try and set the width of the wrapper of the label 250 pixels nothing happens that's a bit of

99
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,390
a mystery and that's one of those things you could spend quite a while messing around trying to fix.

100
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:30,290
So let's have a little look change label with HDMI or something like that and see if we can find an

101
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,450
answer.

102
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,000
OK.

103
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,810
How can I control the width of a label tag.

104
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,890
It looks promising.

105
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,600
Ah ha.

106
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,270
So here we go.

107
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,580
Label is an inline element.

108
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,900
It can have a with the value in order to that you need to change the display type to display block or

109
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,760
float left.

110
00:08:48,760 --> 00:09:01,230
So we'll use float left because we want it to appear to the left of our input that we get.

111
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:10,360
That looks a lot better had we use display is block I would still would have worked but it would have

112
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,140
been above the input which is not what we wanted.

113
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,310
So let's go for floating left.

114
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:27,300
And these are a bit too close I think now so let's add a bit of a margin.

115
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:35,680
I think it's probably worth putting them in a div with a class of

116
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,350
something like form element

117
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,800
rather than applying the margins to the labels and the inputs directly.

118
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,380
It doesn't seem right somehow.

119
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:11,680
So another one that form elements so that also gives us a nice container for our labels and inputs as

120
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,220
well.

121
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,900
Which feels right.

122
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,560
Okay.

123
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:31,800
And then we can take our form elements device and I'm just going to go for a margin bottom of say 10

124
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,380
pixels.

125
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,570
Get that.

126
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,520
Excellent.

127
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,660
Much more nicely spaced out OK.

128
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,610
Now let's add our password fields.

129
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,850
So I'm going to copy the whole day of there

130
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,560
for password

131
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,920
and we'll call it password as well.

132
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:05,230
So this is going to have a type of text but we can actually use a type of password which will work in

133
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,970
exactly the same way as text but it won't display the text when the user types it.

134
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,910
It's more secure if someone's looking over their shoulder.

135
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:23,680
So that type of password name or password and I.D. be password and we won't have a place hold at this

136
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,250
time.

137
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:27,930
OK.

138
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,330
Let's get.

139
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,020
And then we might have a bit of an issue with space here.

140
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,790
But that's

141
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,520
see what pops up.

142
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,310
OK we could do it like that but that doesn't look particularly neat.

143
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:55,860
So let's change our sizes a little bit or just call this password.

144
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,670
Confirm

145
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:07,710
Hoopes the type is still the same only the name and ID that change.

146
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,090
And then that's still a bit of restyling.

147
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:28,650
So let's look at 150 percent and maybe increase the width of our wrapper a little that's too much.

148
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,190
And that will allow us to have a wider

149
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,910
label.

150
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,720
There we go.

151
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,110
Just a touch too close there I think.

152
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,950
Let's make it

153
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,390
130 percent on the size it's great.

154
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,010
I would just need to adjust the label positioning.

155
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,000
So we'll go for

156
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,140
about 15 a little too much

157
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,780
to I-12.

158
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,250
Okay that looks good.

159
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,690
All right.

160
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,590
All that remains then for our AGM L is our submit button.

161
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,820
So it's a form element let's put it inside one of those divs.

162
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,920
It doesn't need a label.

163
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,400
We could use an input or a button here.

164
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,370
It doesn't really matter.

165
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:40,580
But if we're going to have an impact we need a type of submit and then I'll give it an ID of Submit

166
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,580
button and a valley of

167
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,320
Sign-Up

168
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:51,830
OK.

169
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:59,270
So already quite like the styling of it but we need to adjust it a little bit.

170
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,310
So let's give it some custom styles.

171
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,980
I call it submit button

172
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,940
so first off it's a bit too wide.

173
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:19,490
So let's give it its own width of say 100 pixels or an hour

174
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,130
130 that looks about right.

175
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,930
So I'd like it to be lined up with these inputs here.

176
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:38,290
So I'm going to give it a margin left of two hundred pixels should work there.

177
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,480
Put them.

178
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,370
So there's our form.

179
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,710
It's not exactly a work of art but it's pretty neat.

180
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,820
And it does the job.

181
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,490
Now for the interesting bit let's start doing some validation.

182
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,810
So we want validation to happen when the sign up button is clicked.

183
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,020
So let's add that in.

184
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,960
First off for our Javascript.

185
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:06,750
So the sign up button is submit button select selected in the usual way with a hash and then its name

186
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,110
submit button and we want to do something when the submit button is clicked

187
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,590
and that something is going to be a function

188
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,620
as always.

189
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,960
I'd like to know that everything's

190
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,990
connected nicely.

191
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,290
So let's do a quick check on it.

192
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,860
Something's gone horribly wrong.

193
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,900
I've got too many parentheses that.

194
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,370
Let's try that again.

195
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,350
Sign up that we can.

196
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:40,820
Great.

197
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,440
So we'll work our way down from top to bottom for our validation.

198
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,440
So we'll start with the e-mail which is the most complicated but as I mentioned I wouldn't recommend

199
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,860
you come up with your own e-mail validating function.

200
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,270
Internet's already done it for you.

201
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,150
So let's have a look at.

202
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,920
Well we could use javascript but why not go for Jay query.

203
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:10,460
E-mail validation function.

204
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,500
E-mail validation using Jey query that looks promising.

205
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,520
Here we go.

206
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:24,260
So we've got a very very complicated regular expression that I'm not going to go into the precise meanings

207
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:31,160
of all of this but you can probably just about work out that we're looking for a string of small letters

208
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:39,410
or big letters or numbers or these punctuation marks and then an at symbol and then some more small

209
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:47,300
letters or big letters or numbers or a dash and then a range of potential Dotcom's or de-code it ukase

210
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,090
etc..

211
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,950
If you're really into projects you can go into that and a lot more detail and figure out exactly what's

212
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,690
going on.

213
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,500
But for our purposes that will be enough.

214
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,240
So this is a nice function that we can use to validate an email address.

215
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:07,980
So that's the beginning of our code here and we'll just spread it out a little.

216
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,210
Alex nice

217
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,680
that we get.

218
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,250
So you can see this is going to return rejects.

219
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,310
Test.

220
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,870
Now test is a javascript function that we haven't seen yet so we're not certain exactly whether that's

221
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,070
going to give us true or false or the e-mail address or what.

222
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,520
So let's find out.

223
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:44,080
So we need to run this test against the contents of this HDMI input which I remember has an ID of email

224
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,300
so let's select it.

225
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,150
Now we need to get its value which we could google and try and find out.

226
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:02,670
But I think we could just guess maybe with Jay query we need to do it and then that will that looks

227
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,140
promising.

228
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,360
So let's get its value.

229
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:13,470
And remember if we send no parameters that that implies that we want to get the value rather than set

230
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,580
the value.

231
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,840
So that will give us the value and what we want is to run the function is email

232
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,130
on that.

233
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:33,670
And let's then alert the outcome of that to see what it looks like.

234
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,800
All right let's take a look.

235
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:43,660
If I click that so far so looks like we're getting true or false here that's just put in.

236
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,120
I yes that's false.

237
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,270
If we put in ICF at asd you have to come.

238
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,380
It becomes truly excellent.

239
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,450
So this is looking like exactly what we need.

240
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,900
If it's a valid email address then it will be true.

241
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,150
If not it's false.

242
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,600
Brilliant.

243
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,970
So we can actually put that straight in see an if statement.

244
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:14,530
And remember this is going to be true or false so don't even need to put is equal to true.

245
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,830
But what I do need is to test whether this is false because I'm what I'm interested in is getting an

246
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,940
error here.

247
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:28,100
So I'm actually against it is not equal to or.

248
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:35,870
So I'm actually going to put is equally false because that's what I'm particularly interested in.

249
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,740
And if it is we want to show an error message of some sort.

250
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,420
So let's think for a moment how are we going to do that.

251
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,030
That could well be more than one arrow with this form.

252
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:49,150
So what we don't want to do is let each one or anything like that but we do want to display every error

253
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,280
so that the user doesn't fix one and then submit again and then realize there's another one.

254
00:19:53,290 --> 00:20:02,920
So the way I'm going to deal with that is to have a variable called error message which is initially

255
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,720
empty.

256
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,720
And then if we get any of these errors I'm going to add some text to the error message and then the

257
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,020
end will display the whole error message.

258
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,740
That's quite a nice way round when you've got potentially lots of different things to say to your users

259
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,450
but also potentially none.

260
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,050
Start off with an empty string and then had the issues in as you go.

261
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:40,720
So let's append to error message which Remember we do using plus equals and we'll say your email address

262
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,720
is not valid.

263
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:55,010
And for now just to check will alert error message OK let's take a look.

264
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,640
Your e-mail address is not valid.

265
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,020
Fantastic.

266
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,700
In fact I'm going to put a paragraph tags around that.

267
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,030
However a message will appear on separate lines.

268
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,610
All right.

269
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,290
So now to the telephone number.

270
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,190
So the validation here is we want to check if the phone number is numeric or not.

271
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,300
And I did give you a clue at the beginning that there is a J queery function to do exactly that.

272
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,600
So let's see if we can discover what it is.

273
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,860
So now we're looking at

274
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:44,390
string phone with an ID phone and we want to check whether that is numeric or not and that is indeed

275
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,940
a query function that we can access.

276
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:58,930
Remember using string dots to get all the J.A.G. functions is numeric.

277
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:07,510
So if we pop dot vowel again on to the end of that that will test to see if the phone number that they've

278
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,890
entered is a number we could use a regular expression for that as well.

279
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,790
But as Jay query has a built in function we might as well use that.

280
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:29,230
So we actually want to check if that is false cause we're interested in when it's not numeric

281
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:43,930
IP your phone number is not numeric.

282
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,180
These may not be the most useful error messages by the way.

283
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,210
They will serve our purposes but you probably want something a bit more friendly.

284
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,020
Let's have a look.

285
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,380
Yep.

286
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,320
So we've got e-mail addresses not valid phone number is not numeric.

287
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,370
But if we do put a number in there then we just get e-mail address is not valid.

288
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,560
Wonderful.

289
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:10,040
Now for our passwords the main thing we want to check here is that they're the same.

290
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:19,170
So that's fairly straightforward if there are two IDs our password confirm and password

291
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,100
say if password dot vowel is equal say

292
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,360
password.

293
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,390
Confirm thought Vau

294
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,890
in fact once again we're not interested in whether they're equal to each other we're interested if they're

295
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,100
not equal to each other.

296
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:58,860
Error message plus equals p your passwords don't match

297
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:10,780
say let's have a look if I just put two different passwords in we gets the email address but not this

298
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,020
one.

299
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,940
I think that's because I've got to put a hash in there.

300
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,760
It's like again

301
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,960
that's your passwords don't match.

302
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,210
And in the closing paragraph tag as well.

303
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:29,630
All right.

304
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,620
So that's most of the validation done.

305
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,600
The final step I want to do is introduce check just to make sure that they filled something in.

306
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:40,910
In each of these fields and again that's something that we don't really want to give them a separate

307
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,540
message.

308
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,420
The email is missing the telephone is missing the password is missing.

309
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,880
The confirmation is missing.

310
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,320
I want to do that all in one error message if I can.

311
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,900
So where I'm going to deal with that is similar to how I dealt with error message up here.

312
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,180
I'm going to have

313
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,890
fields missing which is initially empty.

314
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:14,910
And then if the e-mail Valley

315
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,540
is empty

316
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:32,020
then fields missing a pen so that's I'm going to give it a line breaks or it's going to be on a new

317
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,140
line and then email

318
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,060
then I'm going to add something very similar for the rest

319
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,010
if the phone number is missing and the fields missing.

320
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,080
Gets telephoned to it again with the Be off of the line break.

321
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,720
If passed what is missing.

322
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,730
Then we add password to it.

323
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,720
And if

324
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,380
password confirm is missing

325
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:22,200
then confirm password gets added to fields missing.

326
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,690
Then we check if

327
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,230
fields missing is not an empty string.

328
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,560
Then we add two error message

329
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,600
the following

330
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:57,080
fields missing and then we happened to that Fields missing.

331
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:02,010
If you wanted to you could add a little bit of code that works out whether one or more fields are missing.

332
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:07,820
So you get the correct singular or plural but I'll just leave it like that for now.

333
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,050
OK so let's have a look.

334
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,390
What if we leave all of these blank then.

335
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,740
Yep we're getting the following fields are missing.

336
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,480
Fantastic.

337
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,700
So we should now be checking for a numeric telephone for a valid email address for matching passwords

338
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,220
and for all of these fields to be filled in.

339
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:35,200
So we don't want to alert the message in that way we want to be a bit more stylish than that.

340
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,840
So what we'll do is inside our wrapper at the beginning we'll have a div with an ID

341
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,220
of error message.

342
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,730
So that's where our error messages are going to go.

343
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,300
And then once we've run through this whole post process.

344
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:05,250
If the variable error message is not an empty string then will display the error to the user.

345
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,380
So will do that using

346
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:20,910
error message to select the error message div will set the h t m l of that 2 error message.

347
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,090
All right let's take a look.

348
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,230
Fantastic.

349
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,970
That looks great.

350
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:34,150
That's exactly the errors that I would expect if we just add in some numbers and a couple of random

351
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,390
passwords to mess things up a little bit.

352
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:42,250
So it is still missing the email address but the email address is also not valid and the passwords don't

353
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:42,840
match.

354
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,510
Fantastic.

355
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,560
So just a couple of things to finish things off.

356
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:54,450
I'm going to add a little bit of styling to the error message

357
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:08,940
I'm going to make the text color red and I'm going to make the font size a little bit smaller.

358
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,620
So it looks a bit need to say font size is 130 so let's try 110.

359
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,880
See how that works.

360
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,690
We have to make sure that it's obeying this one.

361
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:31,960
And remember we've seen that if we put exclamation mark important then that one will override any other

362
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,390
CSSA instructions.

363
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,930
So let's have a look at.

364
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:44,670
That's better but still a bit large I think that's go for 90 percent.

365
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:45,870
OK.

366
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,660
I think that looks better.

367
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:48,890
All right.

368
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:58,290
So the final thing I want to add on is a nice friendly message if the user has finally been successful

369
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,340
in this form.

370
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,340
So that will happen when error message is empty.

371
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,620
So we can just use an else here and then let's give ourselves

372
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,640
ice excessive

373
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:26,640
say a success message which is going to be pretty similar to error message

374
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:32,520
except it's going to be green

375
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:40,890
and white I'm going to use Access Menchie's because any one success message is I'm going to start it

376
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,490
off.

377
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:42,870
Hidden

378
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:51,280
and I'm going to put the content of the success message in here which I'm happy with.

379
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:56,210
I prefer to have the content in the team l if possible.

380
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,370
So you did it.

381
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,350
Congratulations

382
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:02,890
of course.

383
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,810
Normally we'd be redirecting someone to the log in page and getting them to use the app or whatever

384
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,250
service they're signing up for.

385
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,500
But for now we'll just say them a nice friendly message.

386
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:21,430
So here am will take success message.

387
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:27,250
Don't forget the hash and all we need to do is show it.

388
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,780
We could use VSS here to display it.

389
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,450
Show is easy enough.

390
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:47,730
And actually I also want to hide error message because we don't want those error messages still displaying.

391
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,180
Once the user has got it right.

392
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,110
Wonderful.

393
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,280
So let's take a final look.

394
00:31:54,410 --> 00:32:01,000
So I'm going to put in hopefully correct answers to each of these.

395
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,630
Sign up and there we go.

396
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,440
You did it.

397
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,520
Congratulations.

398
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,670
Maybe a touch of padding on the bottom then

399
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,310
or margin would do as well.

400
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:16,950
That would get

401
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,400
better.

402
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,540
Brilliant So I hope you had fun with that.

403
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,100
And as always I hope you managed to do at least some of it on your own.

404
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:35,070
We're now going to shift gears slightly and look at the J queery UI plugin and how we can use that to

405
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:41,580
create some fancy user interface elements really easily and will be working towards our big J queery

406
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,590
project at the end of this section which is code player.

407
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,350
I'll tell you more about that later on.
