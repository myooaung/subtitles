Okay now with forms experts we're going to get rid of our form here and start looking at tables in HCM

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.720
l tables are really useful ways of setting out data or any kind of information to the user in a sort

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.070
of Excel spreadsheet like manner.

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.280
Let's take a look and see how we do it.

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.700
As you might be able to guess we use the table tag to start off our table and then within the table

6
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.730
we have a table row.

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.620
So Tiang.

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.460
And then within the table row we have individual table cells.

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.770
And for those we use t d which is short for table data.

10
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.470
So for example I wanted to put my family's favorite colors here.

11
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:59.160
I might have Rob and then another item of data or cell and then green and that would then fill the first

12
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.470
table row.

13
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.640
Let's just have a quick look and see at the moment that just looks like robe and green thing particularly

14
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.570
special then.

15
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.910
But then we can add another table right in the same way.

16
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.040
And then we could have Kirsten

17
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.890
and her favorite color orange.

18
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.740
Very cheerful.

19
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.900
So now you can see it spreads out everything nicely so everything's well aligned within the table.

20
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.570
So now I'm just going to copy and paste these so you didn't have to watch me typing them again but will

21
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.910
have told me his favorite color is somewhat in transition but at the moment it's still pink.

22
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:55.140
And then Ralphie who doesn't really know what his favorite color is but he's been assigned blame.

23
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.270
So there we go.

24
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.280
That's what our table looks like.

25
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.530
It's not much to look at but in the next section we'll see how we can change the style.

26
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.360
It's CSSA and get some really pretty well spaced out tables.

27
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.160
I'll just show you a couple of other things that we can do with tables.

28
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:22.810
The first is we can have a table head section and then in our table head we might have a table row again

29
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:33.760
and then here instead of having a standard bit of table data we have a table heading section so we might

30
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.390
have a name for the first column for example and then

31
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.550
favorite color to use in there.

32
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.690
Fantastic.

33
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.540
And then let's check that out and you can see that we've got a slightly different styling on the table

34
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.870
head cells there.

35
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.630
So they're bold and they're scented as well and we could obviously change that styling if we wanted

36
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.260
to if we didn't like the favorite color goes on for a bit too long.

37
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.810
We could add a line break in there and then it would again align everything nicely horizontally and

38
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.170
vertically for us.

39
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:19.140
Finally then if we're going to have a table head we should really separate the second part into a table

40
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.550
body.

41
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:28.510
Now this doesn't actually change anything in terms of the look but it makes our clothes code nice and

42
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.380
clear as to which part of the table is which you can see individually indenting all of those with most

43
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.440
text editors you can actually indent a whole chunk of code just by selecting it all and then pressing

44
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.470
tab and that then adds everything really nicely.

45
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.270
Excellent.

46
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.140
So you're now pretty familiar with HCM l tables in the next video.

47
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.630
We'll look at one of the original innovations that led to the web.

48
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.860
Really the thing that holds it all together and that is links.
