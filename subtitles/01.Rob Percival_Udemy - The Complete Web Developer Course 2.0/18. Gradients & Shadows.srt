00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,570
In the previous section we saw how to do gradients using the HCM L5 canvas but if all you want is a

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,020
gradient it's actually easier to do with scissors.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,460
So in this video I'll show you how to set up gradients in CSSA And we'll also look at the different

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,190
types of shadows that we can create.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,910
So I'll start by getting rid of the code from the previous video.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,690
And then let's create a nice simple Dave

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,740
which will give an idea of gradient

8
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,950
and then we'll just select it in the usual way and we'll start off by giving it a certain width and

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,550
height.

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:54,200
So we'll just have 300 pixels and a height of 200 pixels and we'll start off with a background color

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,610
of blue just to check that everything's looking good that we got.

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,100
In fact let's make it 500 pixels great.

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:17,520
So if we want a gradient that goes for example from white to blue top to bottom we just use background

14
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:31,050
and then linear gradient and then we give out two colors so white and black.

15
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,270
Simple as that.

16
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,100
And then we get a beautiful gradient.

17
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,520
And of course we can put any sort of content on top of that as well.

18
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:48,690
So that's just our background for a div we can but whatever we like behind that note that I've left

19
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:54,040
the background color is blue for browsers that don't support the gradient.

20
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,420
So let's see what other options we can put in there.

21
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:04,970
We can switch it to left to right gradient by simply putting two right as our first parameter.

22
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,850
And then it will become I left to right gradient.

23
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:16,530
We can even make it a diagonal gradient by making it to bottom right and you see my text that is there

24
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,470
is even clever enough to know what that is before we even run it in the browser.

25
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,760
And now it's top left to bottom right.

26
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,850
And of course you can change these to anything you like say if you want it to go the other way round.

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,770
You could change that to top left and then that will start with white at the bottom right and go up

28
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,480
there.

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,210
You can even have multiple colors in here.

30
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,050
So if we wanted something that looked pretty horrendous We could use white red green and blue.

31
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,340
And there it is.

32
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,110
That's a bit special.

33
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,450
We can also do radial gradients.

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,570
So let's just create a new div

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,060
and this is exactly the same.

36
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,980
So in fact I'll just copy the width and the height down from up there.

37
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:26,660
And then we just use background radial gradient.

38
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,870
And then we might have white and blue like I'm We could of course use HVM l color codes there as well

39
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,460
as the color names.

40
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,700
And then we get a gradient coming out from the middle but there's a little challenge that's just appeared

41
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,240
for you.

42
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,790
So can you recreate this bottom gradient.

43
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,650
And I'll tell you that it's green at this end and the yellow at the other.

44
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,970
Try and do it without looking at this carryed if possible.

45
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,370
Jeffery

46
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,210
All right.

47
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,550
How did you manage that.

48
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,740
I'll just do it by creating ID code challenge gradient

49
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,680
and then forget to close it.

50
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,010
We'll give it a thought.

51
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:30,520
500 pixels and a height of 200 pixels.

52
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,870
And then the background is going to be

53
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,430
a linear gradient because it's not

54
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,920
radial here.

55
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:51,310
And we want to go to the bottom left to bottom left and we're getting green to yellow.

56
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,240
Simple as that refresh.

57
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,880
And that's what the code was.

58
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,400
So that's about it when it comes to gradients.

59
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,740
Let's look at how we use C-s as three to apply shadows.

60
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,840
There are two ways to apply shadows in C as three.

61
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,350
And that is with text and box shadows.

62
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,590
So we'll start with some text.

63
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:23,470
In fact let's have an H T.

64
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,590
This text will have a shadow

65
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,480
and then it's very simple.

66
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:46,590
What we do is apply text shadow and then the offset to the right and the offset down.

67
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:53,600
And that means that the shadow will be two pixels to the right and two pixels down of the original.

68
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
Now that looks fairly horrendous as it is but we could do a lot more with that.

69
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,300
We can add a color.

70
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,200
So this is my favorite green.

71
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,030
There we go.

72
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,470
So looks pretty horrendous but we've got the shadow at the moment there you can see that the shadow

73
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,090
is completely solid.

74
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,780
It's essentially a copy of the original text.

75
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,880
Generally you're going to want a slightly blurred shadow.

76
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,220
So let's try putting in a bit of a blur.

77
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,390
This will give a 4 pixel black.

78
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,160
And there we go you can see that that looks a lot nicer than it did before.

79
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,800
Still not necessarily beautiful with the black and green combo but it looks a lot better than it did.

80
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,090
We could even have invisible text

81
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:50,040
by setting the color to white and just showing the shadow a slightly different sort of shadow effect

82
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,150
can be achieved.

83
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:02,820
As I kind of go by essentially doing a shadow with a zero offset

84
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:14,030
so we use 0 and 0 for the offset and then say 5 pixels red for the shadow.

85
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,790
And then you get this sort of neon a glow effect.

86
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:26,940
You can even if you really want to put multiple shadows on a single element of text and you can put

87
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,840
them in different directions.

88
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:39,990
So we might have a shadow which goes to the left and up with a blur of say four pixels and make it yellow.

89
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,550
And there we go.

90
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,370
So obviously I would never advise having that sort of a look in your web sites but you can do it if

91
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,140
you want to remember to use texturing gracefully.

92
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,060
And it can add a real nice subtle boost to the style of your page.

93
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:03,180
More commonly used than tech shadowing is books shadowing.

94
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,450
So this as you might imagine happens on Dave's or any kind of box shaped element

95
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,180
so I'll call it shedder

96
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,410
then let's bring it in.

97
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:31,320
So it will set the width to 200 pixels and the height to 200 pixels.

98
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,100
And the box shadow

99
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,730
initially to let's say three pixels 3 pixels

100
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:53,420
we again I should probably give a background color to the box as well.

101
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,090
Let's.

102
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,040
Antique white that we get.

103
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,500
So it doesn't look great once again as a completely solid shadow.

104
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:08,770
But if we choose the blue say three per X then it looks a lot nicer.

105
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,750
And it really does have the effect of lifting the div off the page a little bit.

106
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,770
Notice that that's quite dark immediately around the div..

107
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:27,890
So you might want to change that to gray to have something a little bit more subtle.

108
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,080
And if you want to really bring this of the page then you just increase the book Shadow to maybe 12

109
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:42,270
pixels 12 pixels and then perhaps 6 pixels.

110
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,200
And there you go.

111
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,190
You've got a much bigger shadow there and that's pretty much it.

112
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:54,890
So you now know how to add shadows to divs how to add shadows and glow effects to text and how to create

113
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,820
gradients.

114
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:01,010
Obviously none of the shadows of the gradients that we've created here look particularly great but used

115
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,880
Sutley you really can add a bit of zip to your web pages.

116
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,160
So use it well.

117
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,180
We're now going to move on to look at transformations in CSSA 3.
