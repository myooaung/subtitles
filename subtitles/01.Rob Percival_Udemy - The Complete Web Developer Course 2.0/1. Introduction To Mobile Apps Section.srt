Welcome to Chapter 11 of the complete web developer course you've now covered eight TMLC SS and javascript

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:16,110
on the client side and HP miscue and API is on the server side as well as seeing how you can use bootstrap

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,590
and wordpress to put together great looking Web sites very quickly in this section we're going to be

4
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,700
taking a slightly different tack and we're going to see how we can use the skills that we've learned

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:33,730
so far to build real apps that we can put on Google Play and the App Store using web technologies is

6
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:39,710
a great way to build simple apps because we only need to code the app once and then we can just package

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,130
it to the various different app stores.

8
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,290
It's the only way to do that.

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,190
And I'm going to show you exactly how to do it in this section.

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,600
Once again I hope you have a number of ideas for different apps.

11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,740
And you start putting them together using the techniques we're about to learn.

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,590
Tweet me if you date and I'll forward your tweet to the world.

13
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,900
Enjoy learning how to make mobile apps and I'll see you at the beginning of Section 12.
