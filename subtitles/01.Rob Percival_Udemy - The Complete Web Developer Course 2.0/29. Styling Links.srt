1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,510
So we're almost at the point where we can do our big CSSA project.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:13,010
But before we do that I just want to show you a little bit of styling links because they're very important

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,580
and there are some quite useful things that we can do with them.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,060
So first off if you can remember this from a couple of videos ago.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,710
Can you create a link to say Google dot com which is not underlined but then underlines when you hover

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:35,890
over it with your mouse over it.

7
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,260
All right.

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,970
Have you managed to do that to create a link.

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,960
Of course we use an I and then I Tref to refer to where we want it to go.

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,140
I wonder if any of you put Google dot com

11
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:57,630
like that in your link and then clicked and then got an error.

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,860
Can you think why that would be.

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:11,550
Because you need the TTP at the top to tell your browser that this is not a relative link.

14
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,730
So without that your browser will actually go to Google dot com on your website which in this case of

15
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,500
course doesn't exist.

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:27,120
So you need to put HTP at the front and then colon slash slash and then probably UWW is a good idea.

17
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,220
Even though Google Chrome will work without it.

18
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,950
So there's our link.

19
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,400
Just go back and now make sure that that works.

20
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,280
Yes.

21
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,530
Wonderful.

22
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,740
This is of course underlined those so let's change our styles

23
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,700
so that the standard link is not underlined.

24
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,900
And we do that with text decoration.

25
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,090
None.

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:06,660
But then if we wanted to be underlined on hover we use the pseudo class hover and then text decoration

27
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,030
underline as we've seen before.

28
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,100
So as not underline bear underlined when you hover over.

29
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,330
Fantastic.

30
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,630
So a couple of new things I want to show you.

31
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,390
The first is that you can get a link to open a new tab.

32
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,070
Which is particularly useful if you want a link to something which is off your web site but leave your

33
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,810
web site open.

34
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,680
So let's copy our Google link to see how we do that.

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:52,380
What we do is we set the target attribute of the link to link and that will then open a new tab Google

36
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,680
in I knew.

37
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,960
Just so we know which ones which open the link in it.

38
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,990
Let's have a look.

39
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,670
There we go.

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,170
Fantastic.

41
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,830
I think I'm just going to put those in paragraph tags.

42
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:16,440
So that they look a little bit more separated that we get.

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:25,350
And then I just want to show you a couple more of these pseudo classes so we can use Hulver to decide

44
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,920
what it looks like when someone hovers over it so at the moment it's underlined.

45
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,330
We can also use visited to change what it looks like when the user has been there.

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,980
So if I change this link to a Web site that I've not been to before.

47
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,800
Pretty sure I haven't been to Google or SE for example.

48
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,240
And you can see it's blue.

49
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,950
So Blue is the standard color for inks that I haven't been to before.

50
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,220
And purple is the color for links that I have been to before.

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,450
But we can change that and we can make that whatever we like.

52
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:05,360
So for example we might want visited links to be great but green for some reason.

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,290
And then you can see that one becomes green.

54
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,250
This one is still blue.

55
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:16,560
But if I click on it and then go back you can see now it's green because my browser knows that I've

56
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,570
been there.

57
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,910
So there's a couple more pseudo classes that you can use if you like find them.

58
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:30,180
Just search for pseudo classes links or something like that should get you there.

59
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,890
There you go.

60
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,090
Good old three schools again shows you what they are.

61
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,580
So these are the examples we've seen visited and Hulver.

62
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:48,580
There's also just a normal link so if you want to just style a link hasn't been visited and is not being

63
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,720
hovered over them.

64
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,550
We can do that.

65
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,120
And an active link i.e. the link of the page that we're on at the moment.

66
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:02,460
Then we can use a current active to dial that specifically if we'd wanted to do that.

67
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,260
There we go.

68
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,870
So congratulations you've made it to the end of the core part of the CSSA section of the complete web

69
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,980
developer because it's quite an achievement and you've learned a huge amount.

70
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,850
The best way to keep that all in your head is to practices.

71
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,980
And one of the best ways that I've learned to do this is by attempting to copy existing web sites.

72
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,480
And that's what we'll be doing in the next few years.
