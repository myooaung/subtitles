00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.680
So far we've been exclusively using javascript to interact with the page that the user is on.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.980
But there is a huge amount more that we can do with javascript and we're going to start getting into

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.960
that now by looking at a basic programming concept of variables.

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.500
So first off I'm going to clear all this content to get us back to a nice clean empty page and let's

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.510
have a quick look at what I mean by a variable.

6
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.320
If you think back to your school days you might remember solving equations with X or Y in them.

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.960
In that case both X and Y were variables they were letters that represented certain values and that's

8
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.470
what they are.

9
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.590
In javascript as well and indeed in programming in general so we might for example create a variable

10
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:52.440
which we do using the keyword Voll and a variable might be called X and we might set it equal to 5 for

11
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.240
whatever reason.

12
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.990
Simple as that.

13
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.830
So now we've got a variable which is called X and it's equal to 5.

14
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:10.570
We can prove that to ourselves by alerting the value of x to notice I don't have quotes around my X

15
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.830
this time.

16
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.510
If I do that it will just alert the letter X but without quotes it will alert the value of the variable

17
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.010
x which is 5.

18
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.260
I can change the value of x whatever I like and that will change.

19
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.500
I can also update the value of x later on it's not fixed.

20
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.040
Service starts off as 10.

21
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.520
I can then later on just change x to be 20 for example.

22
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.110
I don't have the VAR this time because I'm not defining X. I'm just changing its value.

23
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.070
So if x is now 20 again that's the value.

24
00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:05.410
I can also have no numerical variables so I might have the variable name and set it equal to rub.

25
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.760
Now to tell the browser that this is a string we put it in quites just like we have done with strings

26
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.460
of letters all along.

27
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.270
So let's have a look now and see what that gives us.

28
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.200
I have a quick think what should pop up.

29
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.100
Of course Rob so variables are hugely powerful things and we're going to use them throughout the rest

30
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.150
of this cause.

31
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.120
How might we use one to do something in a web page like the ones we've been creating so far.

32
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.870
Well let's try this as an example and I'll set it up as a mini challenge.

33
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.590
Can you create a text input and then a button next to it which says change the text.

34
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.440
Is it a text input and a button next to it.

35
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.710
This has changed the text different.

36
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.210
All right.

37
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.970
You got it pretty straightforward.

38
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.870
We just use input and then the default type is text.

39
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.030
But I do like to specify any way that we have a text input here.

40
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.600
So there's a text input and then next to it we're going to have a button with the value of change that

41
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.050
text

42
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.160
and there we go.

43
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.780
And of course it's still alerting robe that get rid of that for the moment.

44
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.390
All right so what we're going to do is we're going to have a paragraph which just says this is some

45
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.370
text.

46
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.520
And then what we're going to set our little page up to do here is to allow the user to type whatever

47
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.990
they want into the box.

48
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.680
And then when we click that button then whatever the user has typed in the box will replace.

49
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.090
This is some text down here and we'll use a variable to do that.

50
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.110
All right so a little mini challenge for you.

51
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.980
Can you make it so that when you click they change the text button.

52
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.320
Something happens.

53
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.290
I don't care what it is you can update some content you can alert something you can do whatever you

54
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:16.650
like but just make it so that when I click that button something happens go for it.

55
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.750
I wonder how creative you got there.

56
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:27.550
I would start off by giving the button an ID I'll call it text changer like that.

57
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:35.870
And then we need to get that button and we do that in the now hopefully familiar way of document to

58
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.630
get element by ID.

59
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.260
And then the ID is text changer and then we want to set the on click

60
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.700
to a function which will define with some kind of brackets.

61
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.940
So I did my challenge just said do some things I will just say alert I wrote for an Now just to make

62
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.150
sure that everything's connected up nicely.

63
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.860
I would recommend doing that when you're working three making a site and making interactive things.

64
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.750
Just do it really step by step.

65
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.720
Don't try and code everything in one go because inevitably it won't work and then it'll take you ages

66
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.480
to figure out what's wrong.

67
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.570
But if you do it step by step hopefully you'll make fewer mistakes.

68
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.420
And if you do make mistakes you'll be a lot easier to see where those mistakes are.

69
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.290
Right.

70
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:35.290
So now what I'm going to do is get the value of our text input and the value is going to be whatever

71
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.150
the user has typed into it.

72
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:47.590
So I'm going to set up a variable I'll call it text and it like that and I'm using the same capitalization

73
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.350
convention so small letters all the way through.

74
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.630
Except for the beginning letters of the second and future words.

75
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.140
And initially I'm going to set it to an empty string like that.

76
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.130
So this tells the browser that we want this to be a string.

77
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.930
But initially it's empty just like the box is initially empty.

78
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:19.230
But then I'm going to take text entered and set it so the value of whatever the user has typed in the

79
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.750
box and to do that I need to set an ID

80
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.730
for my input.

81
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.700
I'll just use text input.

82
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.380
And now I want to get the value of text input.

83
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:47.220
So I do that using Document get element by id text input is the ID and then I want to get the value

84
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.350
of that.

85
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:56.920
Simple as that so this will give us the value that the user has typed into that box.

86
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.890
And just to check let's let its value

87
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.720
just to take a look.

88
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.580
So I'm just going to get a SDF in there.

89
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.660
And there we go.

90
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:18.630
So we've taken our variable we've created it and then we've set it equal to the value of the input which

91
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.970
is just whatever the user has typed.

92
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.620
So final challenge then can you change the last line of our code so that instead of alerting text entered

93
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:35.910
it sets the value of the first paragraph or the of each DML I should say of this paragraph to whatever

94
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.600
the user has typed in.

95
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:38.460
Go for it.

96
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.930
All right.

97
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.690
How do you manage that.

98
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:52.680
I'm going to give a paragraph an ID and I'll just call it text.

99
00:07:53.050 --> 00:08:03.130
And then once again we're going to get that in the usual way and we're going to set it in t HMO to be

100
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.270
equal to a text.

101
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.650
And there we go.

102
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.060
Simple as that.

103
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.440
So let's run this again.

104
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:19.020
Type in some text change the text and there we go.

105
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:27.230
So this is a very basic usage of variables to allow us to add another level of interactivity in our

106
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.820
page.

107
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.580
So we're not just clicking buttons and doing something but we're actually allowing the user to type

108
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:37.440
in something and then getting the results and doing something with them on our page.

109
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.730
So variables open up a whole new world of power and interactivity that we can create with our Web sites

110
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.770
and we're going to take that further and further over the next few videos specifically in the next one.

111
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.160
Looking at array's.
