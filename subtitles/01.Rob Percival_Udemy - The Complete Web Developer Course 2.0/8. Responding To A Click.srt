1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,660
So now that we know how to change the content of a web page using HVM l we're going to attempt to do

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,070
that using a button rather than updating it as soon as the page is loaded.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,430
We're going to have a button and then when that button is pressed that's when we'll update the interface.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,570
And that of course starts adding some genuine interactivity without pages rather than just running some

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,690
code as soon as the page is run.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,950
So try and remember this.

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,880
I'm going to get rid of it now but you're going to need to type it in a challenge that I give you in

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,670
a minute.

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:40,270
So try and have that in your mind what I'm going to do is off to the hello world paragraph.

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,260
I'm going to add in a button

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,720
which is going to have the words change text every time.

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,780
And this is the button that we're going to press to update the text here.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,350
Obviously it doesn't do anything yet.

14
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:07,370
But in order to refer to it in our javascript's we're going to give it an idea just as before so we

15
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,230
can call it whatever we like I'll call it my button.

16
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,290
All right.

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,690
So that's all we need on the H T M L side.

18
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:21,290
Here comes the first mini challenge then can you select the button by its ID.

19
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:27,080
So just in the same way that we did in the previous video when we selected the text paragraph can you

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:37,720
select the button by its ID in javascript different.

21
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,140
All right.

22
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,580
Hope you remember how to do it.

23
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,780
You should have started with document to say that we want to get something within this document and

24
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,780
then get element by ID.

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,040
Thats the key commands that we need in this case.

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,040
And then of course the ID is my button.

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,090
There we go.

28
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,640
So thats what you should have come up with.

29
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,270
You didn't need the enraged DML because all we wanted to do was selects the button and weve done that

30
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,210
now.

31
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,040
So how do we then connect some javascript to this button.

32
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:20,350
Well we don't want to change the energy of the button but what we do want to do is add an on click so

33
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,310
we do that using dot on click.

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,380
And this is effectively the same as writing an on click instruction right there as we did a couple of

35
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:36,500
videos ago but it's much cleaner because we're using internal javascript rather than in line.

36
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,290
So what we're doing here now is we're setting a function that we want to happen when the button is clicked.

37
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:52,590
So to set a function we use equals and then we want to create a function.

38
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,980
Now when we define a function we always have a pair of parentheses or brackets after it.

39
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,420
Quite often these might have some variable names in it.

40
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,420
If we're going to pass some variables to this function we're not doing that in this case.

41
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,620
So really don't worry too much about those parentheses really.

42
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,300
Think of them as things that have to come after functions.

43
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,530
We'll see them in a lot more detail in just the next few videos.

44
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:23,140
So now we've said equal to a function we need to define what that function is and to do that we use

45
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,080
our curly brackets like that.

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,950
So what this is essentially saying is when my button is clicked do whatever code I write in here.

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,960
So quick challenge number two can you make it so that when the button is clicked instead of changing

48
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,630
the text it alerts button clicked.

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,290
So when the button is clicked it alerts button clicked for it.

50
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,380
OK I hope you remember it had to do that.

51
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,510
Very simple.

52
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,770
Just alert.

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,770
And then brackets because this is a function and then we want to pass a string to the alert function.

54
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:11,010
The string is just a collection of characters which in this case we want to say button clicked and then

55
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,570
that's Papau semi-colon at the end.

56
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,380
All right let's have a look.

57
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:21,670
So now refresh and there we go button is clicked.

58
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,630
So that's our first bit of genuine interaction with our page using javascript.

59
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,420
We've run some javascript when the button was clicked.

60
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,950
That's all well and good but what we really want to do when this button is clicked it's changed the

61
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,000
text.

62
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,870
So this is where you need to remember what we did in the previous video.

63
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,100
So can you write the code that will update hello world 2.

64
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,840
Hello Rob.

65
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,000
Or Hello whatever your name is or whatever text you like.

66
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,980
Go for it.

67
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,470
Did you manage it.

68
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,780
I hope so.

69
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,620
We should have started off with document to say that we want to select something within this document

70
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:11,750
then get element by ID because we want to select an element by its ID and then the element that we want

71
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:22,790
to select is the one with the ID of text and then we want to set the in a TNL of this element equal

72
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,270
to whatever we like.

73
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:33,800
So I'm going to change it to Hello Rob just as we had before finish it off with a semi-colon.

74
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,440
That's it.

75
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,300
So that's exactly the same as the code that we had in the previous video.

76
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:47,750
So let's say that and fingers crossed it a all work Harrar fantastic So that's some really genuine interactivity

77
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,060
because we're updating our web page based on the actions of our user.

78
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,350
That's a very quick aside here.

79
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:01,440
I'm just going to remind you of the chrome console which you get by right clicking or control clicking

80
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,920
and then inspects the page and then clicking console because as you start doing more of these challenges

81
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,210
you'll start to get code that just doesn't do anything because remember when you have an error in Javascript

82
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,570
it won't show you the error on the page it just won't do anything.

83
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:26,180
So had you mis typed and typed document by mistake then had you run it nothing would happen on the page

84
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,870
to tell you that you had an error but it wouldn't work.

85
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:36,100
And then here in the console is where you'll see the error say Line 21 something about document.

86
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,510
There we get there's the error document.

87
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,680
Much better save refresh.

88
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,740
Click the button.

89
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,070
All is well.

90
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,340
So if you find yourself getting errors during the challenges then memba to look at the console to see

91
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:55,640
exactly what the areas that will save you many miserable hours trying to figure it out yourself in the

92
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,060
next video.

93
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,530
Then we'll move this along and we'll see how we can change our website content in a much more advanced

94
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,570
way than just updating some text.

95
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,340
See that.
