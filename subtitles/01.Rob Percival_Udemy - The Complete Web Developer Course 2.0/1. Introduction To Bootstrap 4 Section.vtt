00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.180
Welcome to Section 6 of the complete web developer of course I hope you enjoyed the Jay queery section

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.260
and had a good go at the cosplay challenge at the end.

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.390
It was a really big website to make.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.330
And if you managed to make even half of it yourself then you are doing really well.

5
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.750
Now we're going to move on to look at a framework called Bootstrap which is actually built by Twitter

6
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.940
and allows you to make great looking Responsive Web sites really easily.

7
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.820
It's really easy to get to grips with but really powerful and actually powers a huge proportion of the

8
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.430
Web.

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.860
We'll be looking at all the HDMI elements we've seen so far.

10
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.070
So forms tables paragraphs headings and we'll see how they work in Bootstrap and how we can use them

11
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.780
to make Web sites which are responsive.

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:55.780
So appear and look good on every screen size from a tiny phone to a massive computer screen.

13
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.660
Bootstrap is a really powerful framework to get to grips with and I'll show you at the end of the section

14
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.620
how to access and edit the three bootstrap themes that come with a cost worth $300.

15
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.380
So I hope you enjoy the bootstrap section and I'll see you at the beginning of the next one.
