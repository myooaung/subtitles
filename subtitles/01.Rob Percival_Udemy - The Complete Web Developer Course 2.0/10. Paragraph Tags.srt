1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:00,780
Light.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,440
So we're now moving on from head of tags to look at paragraph tax.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,650
Now you might be wondering why we need paragraph tags.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,440
If we look at some standard text

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,870
just like that you can see it looks pretty normal.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:26,580
And then if we put paragraph tags around it which you might remember are just a P for paragraph and

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,420
then we can manually put in the slash Peter end the paragraph tag.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,430
If we then have a look at that.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,160
It doesn't actually have any different.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,330
The paragraph tag doesn't restyle the text at all.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,490
So what's the point.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:47,740
Well let's go back to how it is some text and now what if we want to put some text on the next line

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,890
down.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:58,170
Well you would have thought we could just do that and put it on the next line down in our text document.

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,550
Let's have a look.

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,660
No.

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:08,620
So line breaks as they are known new lines in our text don't actually become new lines on the Web site

18
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,440
itself.

19
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,990
So we have to manually put new lines in.

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,050
There are two ways to do that and I'll show you both of them now.

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,740
The first one is to surround both of our lines of text with paragraph tags like that.

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,670
So there's our first

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,380
paragraph and there's our second paragraph.

24
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:35,420
So if we now save that and refresh then they are on separate lines.

25
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,430
So that's one use of the paragraph tag to give us a new line.

26
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,380
It also makes our code look better because we can see very clearly that we expect these to be separate

27
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,690
paragraphs and we might want to apply different formatting to each paragraph as we'll see how to do

28
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,180
in the next video.

29
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,410
There is another way to put text on a new line and I'll show you that now.

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:06,100
So if we have a third paragraph let's have some text with a line break just like that.

31
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:13,900
And if we want to put a line break in the middle we use the tag B or like that which is short for Boik

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,080
or line break.

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,120
And let's just have a look and see what that looks like.

34
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:25,750
You can see we've now got a line break where the tag is but it's slightly different to the new paragraph.

35
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,380
So it's not a full new paragraph because we don't have that gap in between.

36
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,010
But we do have the text on a new line so they do slightly different things.

37
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,930
The paragraph tag and the tag and you could imagine in different situations you might want new paragraphs

38
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,170
or just a line break like that.

39
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,570
One thing to notice about the are targets the first tag that we've met that doesn't have a closing tag

40
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,800
associated with it.

41
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,150
There are going to be a few more that we'll see along our journey.

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,790
So be our is what's known as a self-closing tag because it's just a line break it doesn't surround anything.

43
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,620
You may also see the art with a slash in it like that.

44
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,420
And this is when you're using X HTL mail which you don't really need to worry about at this point but

45
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,070
you can look up if you want to know more about it.

46
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,230
It's essentially a very precise version of aged him that you might want to use in some circumstances

47
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,600
and that would have a slash right there in the tag itself.

48
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,200
But with age DML and HVM are five you don't need to use that.

49
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,660
So you should just use be like we've got there.

50
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,190
So that's how you use paragraph tags and line breaks.

51
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,730
Now you're really getting up to speed with HD M-L in the next video we'll see how to customize our text

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,890
to change its look and style within a paragraph.

53
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,430
So you then.
