00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.990
Continuing out of HVM L5 features in this video we're going to be looking at the canvass element which

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.230
at its base level allows us to draw on the screen but at its most advanced allows you to create complete

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.550
2D and 3D games that work right inside the browser.

4
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.030
We're not going to go that far.

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.710
But if you want to have a quick google of HCM L5 canvas games or HMO five canvas examples you'll see

6
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.200
some really cool stuff.

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.780
So starting at the beginning we create a canvas with the canvas tag as you might imagine.

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.330
And then we usually give it an ID of something like my canvas and then we're going to specify a width

9
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:56.440
that's OK for 500 and a height of let's say 400.

10
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.400
Now in itself that doesn't show anything at all.

11
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.690
So we might want to give it a little bit of style

12
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.140
for example a border on pick's solid gray.

13
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.800
Just to be sure that it's there.

14
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.620
There it is.

15
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.120
So to do anything with our canvas we need javascript.

16
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.020
So let's bring in a script tag and we'll start by getting the canvas which will do in the usual way.

17
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.930
But I'll assign a variable to it so that we can access it

18
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.250
from later on in the javascript much easier.

19
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.820
So documents don't get element by id my canvas.

20
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.860
And then the first thing we need to specify is whether we're working into the OR 3D.

21
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:17.540
And we do that by creating a context and the context is my canvas don't get context and we want to specify

22
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.780
2D because we're working in two dimensions here.

23
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:31.270
And now let's say we want to add a rectangle to this canvas we would first specify the fill style so

24
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.680
we get that within the

25
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:44.450
context and that can either be a color or even a gradient or a pattern or see how to do the latter later

26
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.910
on.

27
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.030
But for a color I'm just going to get one from my color picker here.

28
00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:00.890
So let's go for a nice green and then copy that to the clipboard with the hash in front and there we

29
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.120
go.

30
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.780
So that will specify the color that we're using until we change it.

31
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:16.730
And then to draw a rectangle we use the fill rect so that we'll draw a filled in rectangle and for the

32
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.830
fill recked function we need to specify four numbers.

33
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.090
So the first two numbers are the coordinates of the top left of the rectangle.

34
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.170
Now the coordinate system in our canvas starts at the top left.

35
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:40.850
So this would be 0 0 and the bottom right would then be in my case 500 comma 400 500 along and 400 down.

36
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:48.500
So if we wanted to start our rectangle in the top left corner and we would use 0 0 and then the last

37
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.410
two numbers are the width and height of the rectangle.

38
00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:01.380
So if we happens to make it 100 pixels in the horizontal and 50 pixels in the vertical and we would

39
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.460
do it like that

40
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.300
super.

41
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.930
So obviously I could change those numbers to anything I wanted.

42
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.560
To make a rectangle anywhere on the canvas so that's rectangles.

43
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.900
How about lines.

44
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.960
Lines are very easy to draw as well.

45
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:35.660
We use context again and then in this case we move to wherever we want the line to start.

46
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.420
So let's say we want to draw a line from the bottom left of the canvas to the top right.

47
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.480
So what are the coordinates of the bottom left of the canvas down here.

48
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.940
All right I hope you get to the bottom left is 0 in the x direction and 400 down.

49
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.630
So that's zero comma 400.

50
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.850
Then we take our context again and line two.

51
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.520
And this is to specify where we want the line to go to.

52
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.690
So once again question for you.

53
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.840
What are the coordinates of the top right of the rectangle of the canvas or

54
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.360
k.

55
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.600
Hope you got are 500 a long and 0 down.

56
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:33.260
So 500 0 and then finally we have to specify to actually draw the line.

57
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.190
And we do that using context dot struck

58
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.420
OK.

59
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.610
So there we go.

60
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.110
So that's drawing a line from bottom left to top right.

61
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.230
Notice that the line is not green.

62
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:54.080
That's because we've set the fill style to green but the line doesn't have a fill style.

63
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.960
It instead has eight stroke style.

64
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.100
So if we set that

65
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:11.620
again we could set that see anything we liked but I'm going to choose a color that's have a red for

66
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.580
this one.

67
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.090
And that will then change the color of our line.

68
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:31.960
We can also change the thickness of the line using context dot line with and we can put that equal to

69
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.240
whatever we like.

70
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:40.740
So I say 20 I'll make it pretty thick 26 1:34 20 pixels to be precise.

71
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.710
And there we go.

72
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.480
So a quick challenge for you then to practice this.

73
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:52.690
Can you draw a 200 by 200 pixels square in the center of the canvas with a red X criss crossing it from

74
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.860
the top left to the bottom right and the bottom left to the top right.

75
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.030
Everett

76
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.030
OK.

77
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.840
How have you managed it.

78
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.160
It's pretty straightforward.

79
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.660
The tricky bit is just getting the math right.

80
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:24.280
So let's create a fill rectangle again and because we want it 200 by 200 in the center here then we

81
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.170
need to work out what the center of the canvas is.

82
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.180
So this is 500 pixels wide.

83
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:37.480
So the center is going to be 250 of that and then if we wanted 100 200 pixels wide in total we want

84
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.920
to get 100 that way and 100 that way.

85
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.060
So hundred to the left of 250 is 150.

86
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.030
And then we also want to go 100 pixels up of the center.

87
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.180
So the height is 400.

88
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.920
So the center is 200.

89
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.730
So 100 pixels up from that is 100.

90
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.720
And then we just specify the width and the height both of which are 200

91
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:06.680
K.

92
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.070
Let's check that's looks pretty good.

93
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.740
Now let's do our line.

94
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:21.550
So we use context dot move to and I'm going to the top left to bottom right.

95
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:27.900
First off say the top left here is the same as what we had for the rectangle there.

96
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:39.170
So 150 comma 100 then we'll have a line 2 and we want the bottom right.

97
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.890
So that's going to be each of these plus two.

98
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:51.210
So 350 come 300 and we'll set the strike style

99
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:06.130
to be our color I'll just copy again.

100
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:18.420
And finally will the context it strike to draw the line.

101
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.520
There we go.

102
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:26.230
So that's the line from top left to bottom right real soon to the bottom left to top right.

103
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.070
We can actually do that within the same stroke here.

104
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.760
So we can use context.

105
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:43.840
Move to and then bottom left is going to be the same as top left but 200 down.

106
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:52.400
So that's 150 comma 300 because we had 200 to that 100 then and then

107
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.260
line two.

108
00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.570
And again that's going to be the same as the top left coordinates.

109
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.430
But it's going to be 200.

110
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:03.710
Right.

111
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.240
So that's 350 150 plus two hundred.

112
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:13.660
And then the y coordinate is the same as for the top left.

113
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.000
All right.

114
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:14.760
Take a look.

115
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:15.990
There we go.

116
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.810
Moving swiftly on we can also draw circles that are pretty straightforward.

117
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.920
So for these ones we use context dot.

118
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.460
Begin paff

119
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:40.710
and then to draw a circle we use context dot arc and then we give the coordinates of the center of the

120
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.610
circle.

121
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.220
So let's say we want the center of the circle to be 100 Kamar 100.

122
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.140
So up there somewhere

123
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.510
then we give the radius of the circle which is the distance from the center to the edge.

124
00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:04.170
So let's say that's 50 and then to specify the amount of Arc we want we use angles and specifically

125
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.570
we use a measure of angles called radians.

126
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:13.770
Now you're probably used to a full circle being 360 degrees but we can also break down the circle into

127
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:22.500
units called radians where instead of being 360 radians there are two pi radians in a full circle.

128
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.790
Now that might sound horrendously complicated but it is useful in a number of situations and is what

129
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.210
we need to do here.

130
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.400
So I want to do a full circle.

131
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:38.340
I want to go from if this is my center I want to get around from the right all the way around from the

132
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.410
start to the end.

133
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:47.340
So at the start of the circle is zero radians which essentially means on the right hand side there and

134
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.030
then remember there are two pi radians in a full circle.

135
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:59.340
So if I want to go all the way round I want to end my circle at two times pi and to get pi

136
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:10.230
in javascript we use math dot Pi so feel free to listen to that explanation again or do a quick bit

137
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:16.260
of online research about pi and radians but this will get us out full circle and I'll do another example

138
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.060
in a moment which should clarify it a little bit as well.

139
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:28.100
And then we use context strike statements before to draw the circle that we get.

140
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:33.740
So now we've got our full circle which is going round from there all the way round.

141
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:39.540
So to clarify what's going on with these angles let's imagine that we want to draw an arc from here

142
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.580
on the left to here at the top.

143
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.990
So maybe this is zero.

144
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.290
And all the way around is to pi.

145
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.250
So the starting point now is going to be half way round.

146
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:59.660
So all the way around is to PI half the way round is one PI.

147
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.600
So we're going to start just math.

148
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:10.290
Pi and then the finishing point is up here which is three quarters of the way round.

149
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:19.030
So if the full circle is to PI three quarters of it is going to be two pie times three quarters.

150
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.850
So I'm just going to take my two pi.

151
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.330
Multiply it by three quarters.

152
00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:31.510
And then that will give me a quarter circle from the left to the top.

153
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.470
All right.

154
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.700
So now we've got rectangles we've got lines and we've got arcs and circles are two more things I'm going

155
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.470
to show you here.

156
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.420
And there are gradients and text.

157
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:51.770
So to add a gradient to our canvas we create a variable called gradients we can call it whatever we

158
00:13:51.770 --> 00:14:03.430
like but gradient makes sense and this is going to be context dots create linear gradient and the we've

159
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.830
got zero.

160
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:10.920
And why 0 then which are the coordinates of the top left of where we want our gradient to be.

161
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.270
And X and Y 1 the bottom right of the gradient.

162
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.140
So I'm going to use this gradient in my square.

163
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:33.490
So the top left coordinates of my square are 150 and 100 and then the bottom right coordinates are 350

164
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.690
up 300.

165
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.730
So that's where I want my gradient to go.

166
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:47.360
Now we need to specify the colors involved in the gradient and to do that I add color stops to my gradient.

167
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:57.870
So we have gradient at color stop and this is going to be the starting color which is going to be the

168
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:05.730
color here or the color at 0 0 is the top left essentially.

169
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:13.630
And I can specify and HCM l color code or I could just use a word description.

170
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.170
So we're going to have white at the top left and then at the bottom right.

171
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.370
This has a color stop of one.

172
00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:23.870
So that's point there.

173
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.080
And let's use

174
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.880
the green that we had before.

175
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:38.170
So that and then as you might have guessed instead of setting a color as our fill style we set gradient

176
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:46.740
as the fill style to them will have a very nice gradient from top left to bottom right.

177
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:52.240
Finally then we'll see how to add text to our canvas.

178
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.740
And again this is pretty straightforward.

179
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.260
We start off by specifying a font

180
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:13.440
so we might go for something like 20 pixels aerial and then we use fill text

181
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:27.190
and I'm just going to use my canvas and then we specify the bottom left coordinates of the text.

182
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:39.320
So if I went it somewhere around the middle at the top there I might specify 200 comma 50 and then just

183
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.370
before we run that we'll need to set the fill style again.

184
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:48.290
Because at the moment we've got it on a gradient which is only defined in that rectangle there.

185
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:59.070
So we can just update it to a field style of it to keep things simple black.

186
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.110
There we go.

187
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.210
So that's pretty much as far as we're going to go with the canvas.

188
00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.340
But I've just got a quick challenge for you.

189
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:12.370
Can you make it say that see my canvas text goes from red on the left to green on the right with the

190
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:13.580
gradients.

191
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.190
Go for it.

192
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:23.240
OK.

193
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:24.010
You got.

194
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.700
So it will need to create a new gradient.

195
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:34.500
I'll call it text gradient which as before is going to be context.

196
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:38.350
Create linear gradient.

197
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.410
Now we want it to start at 200 km or 50

198
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.760
and we want it to end somewhere on the right.

199
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.570
I'll have to guess roughly where that is.

200
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:56.760
I think it's probably about 300 comma 50 as well.

201
00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:08.340
And then we need to add our color stops so the text gradient at color stop and we want red on the left

202
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:17.110
side going to go for red and then we want yellow on the right.

203
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:28.240
So we'll go for yellow there and then we update our fill style to being text gradient and there we go.

204
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.430
Very stylish.

205
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:30.810
All right.

206
00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.690
So there's obviously a huge amount more that you can do with canvas.

207
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.270
This has just been an introduction to how you can create basic shapes gradients and text.

208
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.100
I do want to put that into practice though.

209
00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:47.230
So in the next video we'll have a canvas challenge which will build an analog clock.
