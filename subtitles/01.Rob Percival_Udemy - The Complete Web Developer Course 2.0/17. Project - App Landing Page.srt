1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,060
So congratulations on making it to the end of the bootstrap section of the complete web developer course

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,760
you've been introduced to bootstrap as an HD LCS SS and Javascript framework.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:17,760
You've seen how easy it makes creating great looking Responsive Web sites and we've used a number of

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,340
the components to see how they work and how easy it is to incorporate them into your sites that you're

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,600
going to be developing.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,790
Now it's time to put all of that together in our bootstrap challenge where we'll be making an app marketing

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,730
page.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,040
So let me show you what we are going to be aiming towards.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,280
It's something like this.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,700
So it's pretty straightforward really.

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,160
But it looks nice and has really clear Kolta actions.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,470
So I've pretended that we're working on an app called my app and we've got a nice nav bar across the

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,510
top which should be pretty straightforward.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,900
I then given a background image to our Jumbotron where you get that background is up to you.

15
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,840
But if you do a quick google of free high res photos there are a number of pages out there.

16
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:07,290
All of these I'd ignore the ads at the top and the one I normally use is called an splash dot com but

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,010
you can see there are a number of others out there.

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,440
Feel free to try them out.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,960
And there's even a few sites listing for a stock photo site so I don't recommend checking those out

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,070
if you need some stock photography.

21
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:27,240
But I'm going to be taking mine from on Splash dot com which has got a number of really nice high quality

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,800
photos which you can use absolutely free OK.

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,370
So that's where you get your background image from.

24
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:41,970
We've then got a nice e-mail sign up form them and we're using some cards to display some more information

25
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,300
about the app and also got some really nice icons in here.

26
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,680
I've just chosen some random ones but I've done that with font.

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,860
Awesome.

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,020
You might want to jot that down.

29
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,740
It's really easy to use so I'd recommend doing that as part of the challenge figuring out how to get

30
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,160
icons from Funt awesome into your site.

31
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,060
But of course I'll show you when I go through it.

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,950
If you have any problems.

33
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,730
And then finally we've got a nice big download button which of course doesn't go anywhere.

34
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,210
But it somewhere for the user to click to get your app.

35
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,310
And you'll notice we're all connected up with scroll spy here.

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,500
So as we scroll back up again the links update automatically.

37
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,080
So that's where you got the tape.

38
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,750
Easy right.

39
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,350
Well as always.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,600
Third I recommend doing as much if you can on your own.

41
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,160
And then watching how I get it done.

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,820
Good luck.

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,440
All right.

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,530
So I'm going to start by clearing out

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,160
my code here.

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,010
So we start off with a nice clean file.

47
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,400
So everything comes out of the body

48
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,150
and we're left with just that.

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:08,410
And then I'm just going to switch over to the beat strap h d m l there again.

50
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:09,840
All right then.

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,670
Here we go.

52
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,550
I'm going to start by going to the bootstrap documentation and I'm going to get that by googling bootstrap

53
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,050
for.

54
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,090
And here we go.

55
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,500
I'm going to start with the nav bar at the top of the screen as usual.

56
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,140
I'm going to start at the top and work my way down.

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:41,610
So let's jump over to the documentation and components and Knatchbull And as you so we're heading for

58
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,980
a fairly standard nav bar.

59
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,390
So that top one should do the job pretty much in its current form.

60
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,840
So let's copy and paste the code there.

61
00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:00,520
And remember we don't need a container because we want this to go all the way to the edges of the screen.

62
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,360
Excellent.

63
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,750
So that's looking pretty good as is.

64
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,230
Obviously we need to update it with some information about our imaginary app.

65
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,660
So I'm going to change the nav bar brand.

66
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:23,610
That is the logo to just be the basic map and then I'll keep home as it is I replace features with about

67
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:31,290
are we going to have some information about the app and then I'll just have a third and final section.

68
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,570
Download the app

69
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,110
every day and just check.

70
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,150
Make sure that it's all looking OK.

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,070
And there we go.

72
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,920
Excellent.

73
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,780
As I mentioned we're going to have a log in section here.

74
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,720
Not that that's actually going to work because we don't have any server side languages yet although

75
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,910
we will have quite soon.

76
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:58,960
When we look at BHP in a couple of sections time puffing out we'll just have an email and password option.

77
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:09,590
So let's change first one there to have a type of email and we'll replace the placeholder with email

78
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,340
then I'll just copy and paste that for the password.

79
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,270
And we'll replace the placeholder with password

80
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,780
and then we don't want to search button.

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,760
We want a login button and I'm going to get rid of the outline here for no particular reason other than

82
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,050
I think it looks a little better filled in.

83
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,710
But you're welcome to keep it like that if you like.

84
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:44,280
Notice that the placeholder is displayed but when we start typing of course the password characters

85
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,910
are hidden.

86
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,820
Excellent so far so good.

87
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,880
Now let's move down to our Jumbotron which is still a word that I love saying

88
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,780
that we gave.

89
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,890
So let's start off with the demo code and work from there.

90
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,530
Great.

91
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,800
So that looks pretty good as is.

92
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:17,970
But we want of course a nice big image to make that look even classier.

93
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:27,080
And to find one I'm going to go to splash dot com and let's just have a look down see what would work

94
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,680
where we want one with a lot of space really looks pretty good.

95
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,770
We'll keep on looking.

96
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,620
I'm liking that one.

97
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,830
That part would be a nice non-intrusive background.

98
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,530
So I'm going to go for that.

99
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,090
Of course you're very welcome to try another one.

100
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,540
So I'm going to click on the image and there it is.

101
00:06:50,610 --> 00:07:00,130
And then download there it is now I should be able to save image as and I'm just going to pop it there

102
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,520
on the desktop for now.

103
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,560
I'm going to do a little bit of editing with it.

104
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,830
So I'm going to open it up in Preview.

105
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:15,470
You can do the same thing in Windows if you open up the image in windows photo gallery which does more

106
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,400
or less the same thing.

107
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,440
And then I'm just going to select the bit that I want says something like that.

108
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:29,500
And then tools and crop and that then saves to the part of the image that I've selected.

109
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:36,910
Again if you are on Windows in photo gallery you can do that in the fixed menu and then I'm also going

110
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,430
to have a look at the size because we don't want it to be too big.

111
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,520
And I think that's about right.

112
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,230
It still may be quite large half a megabyte or so I'd probably make it smaller for a production site

113
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,390
but I'll leave it at is as is for now.

114
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:58,650
And then we can export and I'll save it in complete by develop of course and bootstrap

115
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,450
and oh just Colette's background

116
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:17,550
that we can and I don't need to say the original.

117
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,520
So back to our Jumbotron

118
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:30,840
let's add some styles so you set the background image.

119
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,890
So we're working with the class of Jumbotron as you're going to be one

120
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:49,940
and we want to set the background image to have a u r l of background to J.

121
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,320
Right.

122
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,420
Let's have a look.

123
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,100
Beautiful.

124
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,430
A little bit generic perhaps it doesn't say a great deal about what our app is doing but given that

125
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,020
we don't actually have an app that's fine.

126
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,330
Obviously you want to choose an image which is just as pretty but is a little bit more specific so that

127
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,930
people look at that and they can see straight away what your app is about.

128
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,020
Excellent.

129
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,080
Let's just update the text then to have something fairly generic about apps.

130
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,550
So we'll call it my awesome app.

131
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:32,570
And here are the top then if you want a simple compelling reason why someone should download the app.

132
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,860
So this is why

133
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:47,910
you should download this fantastic app so effective landing pages convey a simple amount of information

134
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,860
very very quickly when people are browsing the web they're not going to spend ages reading your sites

135
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,310
they're going to decide usually within just a few seconds as to whether they're interested or not and

136
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,560
you need to grab their attention really quickly get the key feature of the app and make it clear that

137
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,010
they need to download it right now.

138
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,660
All right then we're going to add the code for the mailing list.

139
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,140
So underneath

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,340
there we'll have something like 8:59 on join our mailing list

141
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,190
and you might even want to offer a freebie or something for your mailing list.

142
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:34,970
Really like to get something for free such as a mini course or some information or even a demo version

143
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,620
of the app something like that.

144
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,350
It's always good to offer a great incentive to join your mailing list.

145
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,660
All right then we're going to need our form for the user to sign up to the mailing list.

146
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:53,780
So let's jump over to forms on the bootstrap site and I'm going to take the opportunity to use one of

147
00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:03,280
the ones that have a fancy add on at the beginning then just because I think they look good and we didn't

148
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,270
explicitly try one else self when we saw them in the forms video earlier on.

149
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:15,610
So under that that's right in our form let's leave it as a form in line for the moment and see how it

150
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,510
looks.

151
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,530
And then this label is not going to be for example amount anymore.

152
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:27,940
It's going to be for email and we'll change that to email address.

153
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,190
Remember this is screen reader only so we're not going to be able to see this on our browser but it'll

154
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,380
be great for accessibility.

155
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:41,480
And then I'm going to use the at symbol to denote that this is an email address and it's not a currency.

156
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:48,800
So I'm going to get rid of the 0 0 at the end Amban we're going to make this a type of email.

157
00:11:49,220 --> 00:12:00,510
Classes still form Cointreau ideas email and I have a placeholder of your email and then we'll change

158
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,690
the button to sign up.

159
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,470
And then we can get rid of

160
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,860
the old button then.

161
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,240
Let's take a look.

162
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,940
Quite I think that looks pretty good.

163
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,980
I especially like the blue on top of the blue of the background and a couple of minor aesthetic issues.

164
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,170
I think the email input there is a little bit short.

165
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,610
I'd like to make that a little bit longer.

166
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
And I think I'm going to send to everything here.

167
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,620
Just personal preference but it's pretty easy to do.

168
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:46,880
We we just go out to our Jumbotron styles and add text align center and we we've gotten an ID for e-mail

169
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,550
input already

170
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:58,550
so let's just keep that a little bit of extra with try 300.

171
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,600
See how that looks great.

172
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,590
Excellent silicon Gates.

173
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:11,570
Let's just see you can see displays really nicely at a bunch of widths and even that have really never

174
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:11,940
with

175
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,060
like that.

176
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,840
So now we're going to work our way down.

177
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,760
So we're going to have another nice big headline here.

178
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,140
But actually my courage looking a bit nasty.

179
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,430
So I'm just going to do a quick bit of

180
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,550
indenting to tidy that up.

181
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,040
So I just selected it all and press tab

182
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,730
and that already looks quite a bit better.

183
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:59,830
So after our Jumbotron we'll have a div with a class of container.

184
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,790
And then within that we have a div with a class of right.

185
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:13,090
We're not going to have any fancy columns or anything here because we just want some simple content

186
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,480
but because we're using backstrap It's good to use the different classes.

187
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,290
Generally it'll make you lay out better if you do that.

188
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,910
So let's attempt an H1 see how that looks.

189
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,820
And once again you really need to press home

190
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,380
why your app is so awesome.

191
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,120
And then we want some quite big text here.

192
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,080
We saw before the class is Leite.

193
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,940
So let's try that here.

194
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:55,140
So we're going to have summary once again of your apps awesomeness.

195
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,080
OK.

196
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,770
I think that looks good but I do want everything centered here.

197
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:12,270
So let's give this class a quick ID of app summary like that and then

198
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:24,010
we'll add a text or line of center to make everything nice and center for us.

199
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,040
All right.

200
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:30,080
In the next one it's ready that is we're going to have our three cards.

201
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:35,520
Remember that's the cool new bootstrap for feature that replaces panels and a bunch of other stuff as

202
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,260
well.

203
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:42,100
So let's click on cards and see which suits us the best.

204
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,210
I think that first ones should suit us absolutely fine.

205
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,950
We will need another image but we can get one of those.

206
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,400
It's not a problem so let's copy that over.

207
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:58,110
In fact let's just remind ourselves how we get the deck of cards as it's.

208
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,000
One

209
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,670
after the other.

210
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,330
It's down here somewhere.

211
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,500
Groups is not quite what we want because we want them to close together.

212
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,260
We want a deck just like this great.

213
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:27,150
Remember the really nice thing about this is the cards will all be the same height even if the text

214
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,270
length in each of them is different.

215
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,490
And that's almost always what you want.

216
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,510
When you're doing something like this.

217
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,170
So let's copy that.

218
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,500
Eva

219
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,420
and we'll put it

220
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,100
does it come with a container.

221
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,520
No.

222
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:52,060
But I don't think we'll need one actually because it has a card deck wrapper.

223
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,330
So let's just have a quick look before we add our image.

224
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,990
And it's going a little too wide I think.

225
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:11,830
So I will add a container class to that because we didn't really want it going all the way to the edge.

226
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,540
Nice.

227
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,550
That looks just a little bit better.

228
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:25,210
So now to find out little image that we're going to use We'll get back to you and splashed or come and

229
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,070
so we just want a fairly small one this time.

230
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,390
So let's see if we can find that to be quite cute.

231
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,080
I like the look of that one.

232
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,900
We want one that is just a little bit wider.

233
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,440
So if we crop just that I think that look great.

234
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,770
I may be biased having a five year old son but I think there's something nice about that picture.

235
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:58,660
OK so once again I'm going to write clerical control click and save image as save it on the desktop

236
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:08,100
then go back over to the desktop open it up in pre-WWI and I'm just going to drop it to roughly the

237
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,390
right time.

238
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:15,000
So just something a little bit wider than it is high.

239
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,150
It's trying to get the boys in every game and then tools.

240
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,530
Don't quite like that.

241
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,600
I'm going to undi get a little bit more sky and

242
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,470
try it out.

243
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,410
Great.

244
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:53,590
So then we'll export that into the bootstrap and I'll call it father and some

245
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,640
and we don't need to save the original

246
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,700
OK.

247
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:15,560
So let's change remember data SAAC to SIRC and we'll just copy that up to all of these of course you'd

248
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,630
normally have different images for each of these and they would be images that would have something

249
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,780
to do with your app rather than just one that you thought was charming.

250
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,200
OK so that's pretty good but a little bit larger than we'd want I think.

251
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:39,670
So let's specify a width and but bootstrap is expecting to for one or two for two in terms of the width.

252
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,920
So let's set a card image.

253
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,240
Top

254
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:54,330
to have you with of 240 pixels

255
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,510
OK.

256
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,150
We're not quite there.

257
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,900
So we've got the right width of course.

258
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:08,720
The cards themselves change their width so we're going to need to make the image actually the width

259
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:15,740
of the card and we should be able to do that by just changing the width to 100 percent and then it will

260
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,480
make it 100 percent the width of the container which is the card itself.

261
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,660
Quite so.

262
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,780
It doesn't tell you a great deal of it about the app but it's a nice image.

263
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,280
OK.

264
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,220
I did mention I was going to put in some I can say using font.

265
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,010
Awesome.

266
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,020
So I managed to figure out how to do something similar yourself.

267
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,130
But let's see how we would do it.

268
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,490
So we have a quick google for phones.

269
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,520
Awesome.

270
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,820
Every day and it's just got some really nice icons in there.

271
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,360
So let's see how we would get started.

272
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,240
Mm hmm.

273
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,950
Get started looks like a good option for us.

274
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,550
And then we've got a fantastic CDN link

275
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,550
so let's go for that nice and easy.

276
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:10,720
Of course you can always download the C S S and restrict yourself if you prefer.

277
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,870
So let's pop that up there.

278
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,070
Great.

279
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:24,110
And then let's see if it's got basic instructions to how we at and I can let's have a look at the icons.

280
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,240
Themselves.

281
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,150
Here they are.

282
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,600
So I got a huge number of icons.

283
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,290
I'm going to start with an anchor one because we seem to be at the seaside here.

284
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:44,580
And you can see that we've got the HVM allocate for putting the anchor in.

285
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:52,670
So let's try that out on our first one just at the beginning of the title there.

286
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,280
Wonderful.

287
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,390
Let's just pick another couple while we're here.

288
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,170
Bicycle looks nice.

289
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,980
I'm going to copy that one

290
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,680
and it's just going to get there.

291
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm also going to have a space to space that out a little bit.

292
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,590
And then a birthday cake.

293
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,070
Why not.

294
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,330
Quite sure what features the kids these could possibly represent but you get the idea and I'm actually

295
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:41,110
going to get rid of the last updated part of the bottom because it's not really relevant for us.

296
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,200
OK.

297
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,950
Excellent.

298
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,930
So I'm not even going to edit this text down here.

299
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:53,820
The important thing to note is that the cards all have the same height even though they have a different

300
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,930
amount of text in them.

301
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,200
Great.

302
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,110
I'm feeling a little bit more padding is needed for this part here.

303
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,450
Why the app is so awesome.

304
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,580
So let's just add that in.

305
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,380
We've already got a CSA Selecta for it.

306
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,170
It's app summary.

307
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:18,190
So let's add a bit of a margin top maybe 100 pixels.

308
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,270
Let's try a margin bottom of a hundred pixels as well.

309
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,320
Crates a little too much

310
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,250
so let's try 40 at the top and 50 at the bottom.

311
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,800
It seems to be slightly nearer the top anyway.

312
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,140
And a little bit more at the top I think.

313
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,600
Great.

314
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:42,490
All right.

315
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:48,410
So we nearly Then all we can add now is essentially a footer row will contain the link to download the

316
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,490
app.

317
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,920
Let's start here.

318
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,130
We'll have a container div

319
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,140
and a row div

320
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,410
and we'll have an H T

321
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:33,690
for download the app and I file as if the user wasn't completely convinced I should really.

322
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,480
Why should I download this app

323
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,480
and then we'll have a link to the App Store.

324
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,870
So I'll look on Google images to get the app store link all apps are image I mean

325
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:03,650
I would get that first one looks pretty Perfect's I don't quite like the shining ness.

326
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,820
I think I'm going to go for the second one when you're looking at these it's worth checking out for

327
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,390
size.

328
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,940
So neither one by 3:12 is a little large but it should be OK for us.

329
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:19,350
But another more important thing to be aware of is whether they have transparent backgrounds and you

330
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,860
might not be able to see this on my screen here.

331
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,210
But if you look really close you might just be able to see a square there.

332
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:30,480
A lighter is darker and then another lighter square and that indicates that there is indeed a transparent

333
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,360
background here.

334
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,220
So it will look good regardless of what color our background is.

335
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:42,680
So let's download that's so it will save image as I just control clicked there.

336
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,300
Right clicking would do it as well.

337
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:51,440
And App Store icon is a pretty good name for the image so we'll leave it at that.

338
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,150
So you might want to resize it and make it a little bit smaller.

339
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,520
That's up to you.

340
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,680
But I'll leave it as is

341
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,400
for now.

342
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,240
And then here I'll put it in its own paragraph tag.

343
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,320
This is going to be a link

344
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,790
but I'll just leave the draft blank because I haven't actually got an AppStore page.

345
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,340
And then we'll have an image

346
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,090
and you can see there it is still icon.

347
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,410
All right.

348
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,770
That's probably going to be pretty wide.

349
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,050
But let's just have a look.

350
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,130
See how it comes out.

351
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,540
OK great.

352
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,370
A little bit too large for us.

353
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,450
So let's

354
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,300
make a few changes here.

355
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,710
So first of

356
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,020
will give us an idea of App Store icon and then we'll set the

357
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,690
T.

358
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,380
Let's try out 200 pixels.

359
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:12,180
And while we're here I'm going to give our container an ID of FOTR

360
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,780
and I want to have a background.

361
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,550
So I will give it a background color and let's try Aqua.

362
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,440
We seem to be developing a water theme here.

363
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:45,070
And a padding at the top of this try 50 pixels and also a margin at the top.

364
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,510
To separate it from the cards above all.

365
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:57,760
Again let's try 50 pixels and I want to center everything.

366
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,810
So let's try applying that to William.

367
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,590
So this definitely looks a lot better.

368
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,240
You can see that there's no extra white on the corners there so this is a nice transparent image.

369
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:15,760
The major issue is that our backgrounds is not going right to the edge of the screen and that's because

370
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,840
we've got it set up as a container.

371
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:24,910
I think probably the easiest fix should work fine for us is just to remove the container class there

372
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,150
which is actually fine for us.

373
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:37,910
So that's now full with the only thing I'm not happy with is we need a bit of padding at the bottom.

374
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,410
So let's add in

375
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:50,260
a padding bottom of again 50 pixels seems to be working out well for us.

376
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,800
So let's try that.

377
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,600
Excellent.

378
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:58,680
OK so you can obviously play around with the styles there but there's only one more thing that I'm going

379
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:05,370
to do and that is set up these links with scroll spy so that we can link to different parts of the page

380
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,280
and that it will update automatically as we scroll as well.

381
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,300
So first off let's set the links up

382
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:27,540
so we'll get our Jumbotron an ID of jumbotron and we'll set up that link not there.

383
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,120
All right.

384
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,470
Yes.

385
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,460
That will take us to the top of the screen.

386
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:43,890
And then about we want that to take us to the card deck wrapper.

387
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,680
So we'll call this about

388
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,190
and link there.

389
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,970
And then we want that one to link to a photo.

390
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:00,330
So let's just have a quick look at our links work about.

391
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:00,620
Yes.

392
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,540
Wonderful.

393
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,390
And download the app is at the bottom there.

394
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,170
Great.

395
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:20,010
So let's just set up scrolls by Remember that we need to add data spy is equal to scroll to the body

396
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,430
and then the data target.

397
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,140
And that's the Nev.

398
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,310
so we could use anything here.

399
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:42,240
But I think it makes sense to give us an idea of nav bar and then we can set up that data target there.

400
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,940
All right.

401
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,230
We also need to add

402
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:54,910
a position is relative to the body for this to work.

403
00:30:54,990 --> 00:31:00,780
And of course we'll need our nav bar to be fixed to be able to actually see it when we scroll down.

404
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,000
So at a nav bar fixed top cost of that.

405
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,560
So that's going to cause an issue with our Jumbotron but that's easily fixed as we go.

406
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:18,150
So you can see that that did update for about but not for download the app because it's not tall enough

407
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:22,760
to get to the top of the screen so I'm going to change a couple of things then.

408
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:29,940
First of all I'm going to change the data offsets to be pretty high.

409
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,760
So let's try 150 pixels to see how that looks.

410
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:44,260
And also at an extra hundred pixels to the top on the bottom

411
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:51,370
or the padding rather than the margin.

412
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,730
And let's have another look.

413
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:59,030
So now we do get to download the app that's just on my screen size.

414
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,820
It's not critical but it's a little bit better.

415
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,180
And you can see home is highlighted all the time there which is not what we want.

416
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,320
So let's get rid of the active class

417
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:21,200
on Hayyim and then it should be active anyway at the top.

418
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,250
But then it will switch to a the active div..

419
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,670
Brilliant.

420
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,800
So finally all we need to do is just move the Jumbotron down

421
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:43,110
and we can do that by giving it a mountain top of I'd say about 50 pixels.

422
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,780
Wonderful.

423
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,360
So we've got our NAV bar working well without log in.

424
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:57,990
And as we scroll down scrolls PI kicks in and we get we've got our cards with their nice icons and we've

425
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:05,490
got our download link at the bottom and of course it's all brilliantly responsive as we get an hour

426
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,070
an hour.

427
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,520
Everything still looks great.

428
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,210
Wonderful.

429
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,340
So I hope you enjoy making them.

430
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:23,090
I hope you're inspired to make some landing pages of your own.

431
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:28,550
We're not quite done with bootstrapping because one of the many great bonuses you get with this course

432
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:36,950
is a collection of three great bootstrap themes which are the official themes from the makers of bootstrap

433
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,930
themselves.

434
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,980
So in the next video I'm going to show you the basics of these themes and how you can start editing

435
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:51,090
them to make fantastic looking dashboards marketing web sites and web apps.

436
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:51,920
So you then.
