00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.880
So congratulations on making it to the end of the day weary section of the complete web developer of

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.820
course we've gone from introducing Jay query and showing you why you might want to learn a javascript

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.620
framework.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.120
Then we recreated a lot of the JavaScript techniques that we learned in the previous section NJ query

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.520
and we saw that they were generally shorter easier to read and easier to extend and improve NJ query.

6
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.550
Then we moved on and we did some fancy animation unfading with Jay Guerrieri which was really easy.

7
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.690
We saw how we could use Jey query and Ajax to build an interactive Web site that didn't require any

8
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.810
page refreshes which is really the most powerful thing that we've learned in this section.

9
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.010
Then we learned about regular expressions and we did some form validation and finally we looked in detail

10
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.260
at.

11
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.580
Jay query why don't come as an example of a query plug in and how we might use the general skills of

12
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.040
looking at documentation and extracting the bits of code that we need to make our websites do what we

13
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.660
want them to quickly and easily.

14
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.100
So that's a query for you.

15
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.320
I hope you like it.

16
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.510
And now I'm going to give you an opportunity to practice what you've learned by building a project which

17
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.590
I call code play.

18
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.280
Now if you remember back to the beginning of the course I talked about how you might want to share the

19
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.240
code that you're writing with others either to get feedback or bug fixes or to just share a good technique.

20
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.690
And one of the web sites I showed you was JSE been dot com which is a great way of doing that.

21
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.050
And this is more or less what we're going to recreate with our code player.

22
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.560
So we're going to build a slightly simplified version of this.

23
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.980
It's going to have all the core functionality that is H M L C Ss and Javascript panels which appear

24
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
and disappear as you click on them.

25
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.030
We're going to miss out the console because that just adds unnecessary complexity at this point I think.

26
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.850
And we going to have the output there on the right as well.

27
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.440
So let me show you the final version of what we're going to produce.

28
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.310
And then you can have a go at producing it yourself so you can see the design of my version is pretty

29
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.060
similar to JSE been.

30
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.970
I've simplified it and I've renamed it to code player.

31
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.530
But other than that we've got the core toggle buttons at the top and then the 2 content frames here

32
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.740
as well.

33
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.050
And the caudal toggle buttons of course work really well we can switch off HDMI l switch off CSX and

34
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.280
also Javascript.

35
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.560
So we've got all four happening at once here.

36
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.700
And just like with gaspin as soon as I change anything here

37
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.760
it's updated immediately in the output window over here.

38
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.440
Exactly the same with Stiles

39
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.440
and

40
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.200
Javascript.

41
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.110
There we go.

42
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.640
So that's basically it.

43
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.990
As always there's a couple of things that we haven't seen before but they're pretty minor and you should

44
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.290
be able to google to get the answers.

45
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.440
So have a go at it.

46
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.300
Best of luck.

47
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.770
I hope you managed to come up with something pretty close to this.

48
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.690
But of course as always I'll show you how I solve the problems after the pause.

49
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.360
Good luck.

50
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.330
All right.

51
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.980
Well here we go.

52
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.700
So let's gets our basic framework up here.

53
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.430
There we are.

54
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.830
And then let's clear our file.

55
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.310
Let's start with a look at gyrus been dot come and look at the overall style and out of the page.

56
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.920
We're going to want a bar of the top here with HDMI LCS as JavaScript and output buttons.

57
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.280
And then I'd like to have code player as a little logo on the left there and then below that we want

58
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.600
the rest of the screen to be divided into the four panes.

59
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.670
We're going to toggle on and off with those buttons.

60
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:18.040
So I'm going to start by creating this top panel here mostly using CSI as we move onto the main area

61
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.840
after that.

62
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.590
All right.

63
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.690
So let's see if I can get that background get grey color first off using my color drop her hair color

64
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.710
picker that we've seen before.

65
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:38.680
So I want to pick a color from the page and the color is like one the one the one the carpet the wrong

66
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.130
color but I can remember the right.

67
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:55.010
OK so let's have a div with an ID of let's call it head up or top bar or something like that.

68
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.780
And then within that I want to have my logo on the left

69
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.030
which is just going to be a simple text code play.

70
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:16.400
But I want that to appear on the left and then I'm going to want a collection of these divs or buttons.

71
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.680
I think I'm going to call them divs and then that'll be easier to style them.

72
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.340
Exactly how I want.

73
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:39.060
So let's have a div to be our pattern container and then within that we'll have our buttons.

74
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:56.560
So I'll give it a class of toggle button and the first one is going to be HGL and will need IDs for

75
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.030
each of these as well because we need to do something when each of them are pressed.

76
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.470
So let's have our first one

77
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.640
the class of talk about an idea of HCM.

78
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.870
Second one class of toggle button ID of CSSA

79
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.840
that one

80
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.040
ID of javascript

81
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:37.120
and the fourth one with an ID of output.

82
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.130
So in terms of content that's all I need for my top job.

83
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.990
So let's see how it looks without any styling.

84
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.510
Hmm not great.

85
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.090
Not to worry though we can fix that easily enough.

86
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:59.110
So first off let's add our necessary styles.

87
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.900
I'm going to change the body font

88
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.130
T.

89
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.300
Just a simple

90
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:21.910
Sunseri great and then work our way down.

91
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:27.390
All right Sam L. elements applying our styles to them so our heads.

92
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:35.990
Dave we want to have a width of 100 percent a background color.

93
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.660
Oh do you remember what it was.

94
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.210
I think it was one day one day one day.

95
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.560
Let's just have a look now.

96
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.610
It definitely wasn't that

97
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.230
I think we need to pull out the whole with

98
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.270
to get what we need.

99
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.050
There we go.

100
00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.460
All.

101
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.040
By the looks of it

102
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.970
OK that's better.

103
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:27.040
We definitely want to get rid of any padding then so let's add padding is there and margin is zero to

104
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.820
the body that we get.

105
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.750
But I think we can have a bit of padding in the header.

106
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:43.030
So let's start with the padding of five pixels.

107
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:48.920
OK that's beginning to look nice and I'm going to leave my logo stylings for the moment because I want

108
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:54.580
to see how much space I've got once I've styled the buttons.

109
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.380
So let's style my button container next

110
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.700
and the main thing I want to do is center it and give it a certain width.

111
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:12.920
So let's start with the width of 200 pixels will probably need to increase that a little bit but we'll

112
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.810
see how it goes.

113
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:24.270
And you'll probably remember a margin of zero or water is what we need to center it.

114
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.210
There we go.

115
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.770
Obviously it doesn't look center there but that's OK because these are just aligned to the left.

116
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.780
So the whole thing goes from about there to about that.

117
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:35.550
All right.

118
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:40.480
Now let's apply some styles to our toggle buttons.

119
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:51.850
The main thing we're going to want them to do is flight left so that they happen one after the other

120
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.700
great.

121
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.270
That reminds me that we'll need to make the logo float left as well.

122
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:14.260
So that everything is in line and that means we kind of need a height for our Head of

123
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.860
let's go for 20 pixels for the moment.

124
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.300
We'll probably need to increase that a little bit.

125
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.640
OK.

126
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.810
So it's already looking a lot better than what we started with.

127
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.070
The main thing we're going to need next is this nice buttoned styling.

128
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.010
So let's apply that

129
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.550
stuff.

130
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.790
We'll have a border of one.

131
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.610
It's solid gray.

132
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.280
OK.

133
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.800
Not beautiful yet but we'll get that

134
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.630
let's increase our weight.

135
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.100
That's the 300 pixels.

136
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.560
Let's introduce some padding.

137
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.860
Let's try four pixels see how that looks.

138
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:09.240
OK.

139
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.110
Not bad.

140
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:17.200
Now you can see that we've got a kind of double border there because we've got the left border and the

141
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.900
right borders together.

142
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.690
And that's one thing that we don't want.

143
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:27.530
So let's fix that by setting the border right.

144
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.690
To be nutten and that then fixes that problem whilst introducing the problem that we don't have one

145
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:39.970
on the right but that's ok we can fix that easy enough and we're actually going to need some custom

146
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:48.360
stylings for HDMI out and output anyway because we want those to have the nice rounded effect.

147
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.050
So let's apply that

148
00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.700
we'll add a special style for HCM El

149
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.770
say we want a border

150
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:26.420
top left radius of let's try four pixels and a border bottom left radius of four pixels as well.

151
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.070
Lovely.

152
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.860
And then similarly for output

153
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:42.280
the right most of this time we want a border top ranked radius of four pixels.

154
00:12:42.280 --> 00:13:00.350
We want a border bottom right radius of four pixels and we want a border right of one X solid gray beautiful.

155
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.800
Ok I'm pretty happy with that.

156
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.960
I think I want the text there to be a little bit smaller.

157
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:12.900
So let's try setting the font size to 90 percent.

158
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:14.900
Yep I like that.

159
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.420
And a little bit more padding

160
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.180
grates.

161
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.210
OK.

162
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:27.190
You can spend a lot longer styling days as you wish but I think that's good enough now that I've got

163
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.000
these set up.

164
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:34.030
I can change the width of my container so it's correctly centered.

165
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.680
So let's just experiment a little bit.

166
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:49.840
Let's reduce it to 200 pixels so that's too small to 30 still too small to 50 is big enough.

167
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.020
So essentially want to make this as small as we can

168
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.880
without doubling up any of our rows

169
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.980
and then it will be correctly centered

170
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.560
game 2 3 3 is what we want.

171
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.850
Great.

172
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.130
So now buttons look good.

173
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.700
Obviously the head bar is not quite as high as I'd like.

174
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.550
We could fix that with a width with height.

175
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:25.420
I mean so let's experiment with that.

176
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.360
Thirty pixels.

177
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.200
That looks actually pretty bad on Saturday.

178
00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.410
So now let's just change

179
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.670
the logo.

180
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:46.760
To have a fun weight of bold and let's try font size of 120 percent.

181
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.080
See how that looks.

182
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.700
I think that's fine.

183
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.610
We'll then give it a little bit of padding to move it around.

184
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.950
So let's try three pixels at the top.

185
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.290
And

186
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.990
five pixels left and right.

187
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.080
I think that looks pretty good.

188
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.370
Obviously it's not great styling but it does the job.

189
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:14.040
All right.

190
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:19.080
So now we're more or less done without hotbar in terms of its layout and stylings.

191
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:26.250
The next thing I'm going to look at is setting up the J query to apply the necessary effects in terms

192
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:31.850
of the hovering and whether each item is selected.

193
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.180
So let's set up the hovering Festival.

194
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:45.470
We're going to do that with a bit of jay query and we want to apply a query to all the toggle buttons.

195
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:55.730
So we use the dot or period for our class selector and we want to select toggle button and you may remember

196
00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:03.500
the J.A.G. command Hulver which is perfect for what we want here and what we want to do is when the

197
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.730
user hovers over one of these we want to turn the background slightly darker.

198
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:17.630
So we want to apply it to the one that the user is hovering over and we do that using this as we saw

199
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.380
a few videos ago and we want to set the

200
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.410
background color.

201
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.820
Let's just try grey.

202
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.660
See how that looks.

203
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.190
All right.

204
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.670
That hasn't done anything not to panic.

205
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:41.060
Let's inspect and see if we've got a problem in our J query somewhere.

206
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.830
Oh yes in fact my Jaker is completely wrong isn't it.

207
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.270
I've forgotten to say that we're defining a function here

208
00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:57.910
and then we need to finish off our function down there.

209
00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.680
All right let's try that again.

210
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.590
Ok that's better.

211
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.560
So that works really well.

212
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:10.590
One problem obviously that we've got here is that we're making the background color gray but then we're

213
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:15.380
not changing it back to what it was when the hover stops.

214
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.560
That's not something we've seen how to do before.

215
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:23.910
But it would be surprising if there wasn't something built into the break where we have a function that

216
00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.310
could cope with that.

217
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:32.670
So I'm just going to google Jay query Hulver and let's have a look at the documentation and see if there's

218
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:33.580
an easy way.

219
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:40.780
To deal with that Harto it's looking like we've got a handler in and the handler out

220
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.850
so it is perfect for what we need to handle this to the most elements to be executed when the mouse

221
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.310
pointer enters and leaves the elements.

222
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.160
So let's have a look at that example then.

223
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.740
So it looks like all we need to do is add two functions.

224
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:04.900
The first one will happen on the other hand then the second one will happen when the user stops hovering

225
00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:16.760
so that should be simple enough so there's our first function.

226
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:20.450
So we want to add the second one right after that

227
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:29.760
and that's going to be something very similar.

228
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.440
So it's just going to take the CSSA of this.

229
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:42.800
So that is the element that's been hovering over and set the background color back to a big string of

230
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.950
ears that it was before

231
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.350
OK let's have a look.

232
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.640
March Pedda great.

233
00:18:55.810 --> 00:19:01.030
Finally here we need to have our buttons go blue.

234
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:07.470
When they are selected and we want to have initially t m l an output selected.

235
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.180
So the way I'm going to deal with that is have a class

236
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:21.240
known as all that I will call active and we'll apply the active class when the user has selected to

237
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.750
view whichever pattern we're talking about.

238
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:35.600
So initially we want HDMI and output to be active but the other is not so let's decide as stylings Hoopes

239
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:45.970
actually all we want is for the background color to be that nice shade of blue.

240
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:50.880
So I'm going to have problems getting that with my color picker because it's going to I either write

241
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.330
it.

242
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:58.300
I suspect but I think it's the same as the shade of blue here.

243
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.750
So I'm just going to use that shade of blue.

244
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.650
Let's have a look.

245
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:20.510
So we want to set the background color of anything with an active class to that really wonderful.

246
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:29.000
And finally I want to make it so that when the user clicks on one of these it becomes blue or stops

247
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.680
being blue.

248
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.690
If it was already blue.

249
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.480
And I'm actually wondering if there might be a better way to do that.

250
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:41.300
You'll notice that when we remove our Hulver we lose the blue which makes sense because we've set the

251
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:47.420
background color back to the string of ears which is light gray so actually would it be better to have

252
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.640
a class for this.

253
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:55.840
Generally a highlighted class and then toggle that class on the hover.

254
00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:56.670
Let's have a look.

255
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:14.730
So we'll call it highlighted button and all it is is it's going to have a background color of gray

256
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:26.450
and then when we hover over we want to add the class

257
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:30.410
of

258
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:43.160
highlighted button and then when we stop hiring covering over we want to remove the class

259
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.360
of highlighted

260
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:51.780
button.

261
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:57.630
Now add and remove class are not functions that we've seen before but with a little bit of googling

262
00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.840
you could get them.

263
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.930
And then the advantage of this is it adds the class.

264
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:10.550
But then it removes the class so it retains whatever styling it had before.

265
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:15.200
So that's a better way of doing it than just manually changing the background color.

266
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.660
So does a better job of keeping our styles and our code separate.

267
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:23.360
So we don't have any hard coded colors in javascript.

268
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.450
Great.

269
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:32.650
So then we just need to make it so that when the user clicks it adds or removes the active class

270
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.200
it should be pretty straightforward.

271
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.750
When the toggle button is clicked

272
00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:54.250
we want to run a function and this time we want to toggle the base class.

273
00:22:54.530 --> 00:23:00.830
So I'm going to do a quick search for Jay query toggle class because I think there's probably a way

274
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:01.550
of doing it.

275
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:05.790
That makes that easy.

276
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.250
Yeah look we've got a toggle class function there.

277
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.560
Let's have a look at example.

278
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.200
So Tobel class looks to me like it's just going to add the class if it's not there and remove it if

279
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.350
it is there.

280
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:20.990
So that's perfect.

281
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:33.990
So we want to take the element that's been clicked on and we want to toggle the class of active

282
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.160
and this should add the class of active which will make the background blue.

283
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.470
If it's not there and it will remove it

284
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.410
if it is that

285
00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:55.740
the only slightly odd behavior there is that when we initially click we've still got that background

286
00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:56.790
color of gray.

287
00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:02.340
So we don't see that it's been selected until we remove the mouse pointer.

288
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:11.750
So to get around that I'm just going to remove the highlighted Button class

289
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:18.500
whenever the user clicks on it.

290
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:23.760
So that should give it a quick bit of feedback so if I now play there you can see straight away that

291
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:31.650
that's selected if I click again you can see straightaway that it's not selected great.

292
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:35.230
So now we've got our buttons behaving in the way we want to.

293
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.710
Now the real challenge comes.

294
00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:40.670
We need to actually make the main content of the page.

295
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:48.410
Start off by getting our HDMI and output looking right and working correctly then we'll add in our CSSA

296
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:49.860
and Javascript.

297
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:55.690
So I'm going to make the HD TNL a text area and the output a div.

298
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.490
So let's make that happen.

299
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.280
So underneath the head section will have a div

300
00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.550
I'll just call it body container.

301
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.740
And the first thing that will have there is a textarea

302
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.790
it will have an ID of each DML textarea

303
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:32.060
And let's give it a little bit of initial content.

304
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:34.250
Hello world.

305
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.010
All right there we go.

306
00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.350
Very good.

307
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.050
That's next.

308
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.770
Sort out the width and height.

309
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.550
The only text is I have to have the same style.

310
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.580
So we're just going to style it using textarea.

311
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.750
But you can put a clause in there if you prefer.

312
00:25:54.190 --> 00:26:03.110
And we want width of Initially 50 percent and a height of 100 percent.

313
00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.530
Let's have a look at that.

314
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:11.980
Now that looks pretty good but if we scroll down you can see we've actually got a little bit more textarea

315
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:12.820
than we want.

316
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:19.420
And that's because it's setting the height of the textarea to the whole height of the page which is

317
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.830
not what we want.

318
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.710
So as always there's a number of ways to fix that.

319
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.740
But as we're in A-J query section let's figure it out with a query.

320
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:32.200
What we really want is the height of this text area to be equal to the height of the user's page minus

321
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.950
the height at the top here.

322
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:41.280
So what we don't how to do that is get the page height.

323
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:42.940
So let's have a quick google.

324
00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.530
I'm sure there's a way to do it.

325
00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:47.500
OK so height we're aware of.

326
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:51.610
A ha looks like that second one is actually what we want.

327
00:26:51.930 --> 00:27:00.480
So window height so string and then window selects the window.

328
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:03.160
Do we want the window height or the document height.

329
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:03.450
Then

330
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.390
start looking at those definitions.

331
00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.370
We want the window height the height of the user's screen.

332
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.520
OK.

333
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.480
So let's set the

334
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:41.730
text area height to be equal to A the window height minus

335
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.810
the height of the head.

336
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:59.740
So that is had a don't write so we're setting the textarea height to be equal to the height of the window

337
00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.870
minus the height of the head.

338
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:09.550
Let's just have a look and we'll just get rid of the CSSA high command so we can see clearly what's

339
00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:10.420
going on.

340
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:17.270
And you may have noticed I've forgotten my parentheses after height there

341
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.050
OK that still a little bit large.

342
00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.960
I suspect that's down to some padding.

343
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.730
So I'm going to subtract

344
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.620
Let's try an extra 10 pixels and see how that looks

345
00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.500
extra 15 that looks just about right.

346
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.060
We also don't want this to be resizable.

347
00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:49.960
So let's see if there's an easy way to make textarea well not resizable.

348
00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:56.020
We go again this is something we haven't done before so we'll do a quick google to find out how to do

349
00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:02.110
it how to disable resizable property of textarea.

350
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.730
That looks very promising.

351
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.260
Let's have a look.

352
00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.590
Resize isn't

353
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:12.710
OK.

354
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.870
That should do it.

355
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.400
Let's have a look.

356
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.530
Excellent.

357
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:25.100
So now no longer resizable wonderful.

358
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.830
So now let's just add in

359
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.510
our output.

360
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.400
I'm actually thinking about it.

361
00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:40.580
I think making it an I-frame will be a lot easier because we want to be able to process code in this

362
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:45.110
I-frame and that's a lot easier to do in an I-frame than a div.

363
00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:54.910
So let's have an I-frame with an ID of output and just thinking about it there.

364
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:58.420
I would like to have the same word after each of these.

365
00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:06.620
So after HCM LCS s and Javascript so that it's easy when someone clicks on them to find the corresponding

366
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.820
element down here.

367
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:17.470
So I think I'm going to change text area there to panel just so that I can use the same word for all

368
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.360
of them when I need to display or hide them later on

369
00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:25.440
OK.

370
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:30.050
And let's just have a look at that.

371
00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.740
It's sort of in the right place but we've got a little bit of work there.

372
00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:47.730
So let's have a panel of class for each of those.

373
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:58.660
I think the only thing we'll need for all of them is I float left and actually that with being 50 percent

374
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:04.660
could be in the panel class as well.

375
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.140
Now that makes the I-frame disappear completely.

376
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.700
Or does it.

377
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:15.760
It's actually gone underneath because it's slightly too wide now and that's because remember the with

378
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.230
being 50 percent a little bit of padding is added on to that.

379
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:23.980
And similarly with the I-frame So the total with here is slightly more than 100 percent which is why

380
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:28.270
the I-frame goes below the textarea.

381
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:34.680
So again a number of ways to fix that but I'm going to do it with a query just like we did down here.

382
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:44.760
So this time we're going to take our panel class and apply the width.

383
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:49.360
We're going to change the width of it to the window with

384
00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:57.550
this time we don't want to get rid of a head up but we do want to divide it by two.

385
00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:07.060
And then we want to subtract a certain number from that which will be equal to our padding there.

386
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:08.830
So that looks a lot better.

387
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:13.780
Let's just reduce that number as much as we can.

388
00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:15.280
I think that looks fine.

389
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:23.650
And similarly we can actually change the textarea that 2 panel because we want to change the I-frame

390
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.200
height as well.

391
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:31.210
So that will then stretch the I-frame all the way down to the bottom.

392
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.940
The I-frame However I don't think we need a border on a two

393
00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:47.670
so let's remove that.

394
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:48.510
There we go.

395
00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:56.160
And that actually makes you want to remove the border from the AGM at the top that so let's add a border

396
00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:03.520
top none to our text areas and that's now a bit striking as well.

397
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:08.040
So I'm going to change the border color to Gray

398
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:11.420
great.

399
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.080
I think that's a bit neater.

400
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:14.090
Great.

401
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:18.150
Now we just need to get the HVM to display in our I-frame.

402
00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:19.990
This is something we haven't done before.

403
00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:20.710
So

404
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:32.150
let's try something like I-frame change DML content.

405
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:33.000
This is good.

406
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:38.150
We've changed the U R L before but we haven't changed the contents.

407
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:38.620
There we go.

408
00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.640
So it looks like we can take the I-frame and then just change the contents like that.

409
00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.890
That change in the contents of a specific div..

410
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:48.550
But we're going to change the contents of the whole thing.

411
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.650
So let's just copy that code.

412
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:58.880
Initially let's just run this command.

413
00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.330
When the page lights

414
00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:10.600
I don't want to update a particular Div I want to update the whole HDMI all of the frames on to find

415
00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:18.190
the HD tag and replace it with just for now my Adjt. him El.

416
00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:19.410
There we go.

417
00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:19.730
Great.

418
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.600
So we've changed the code of the I-frame.

419
00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:26.350
And you can see that we've got none of the same styles as for the rest of the page.

420
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:32.820
Because this is a I-frame within it so it doesn't take on the styles which is actually ideal for what

421
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.310
we want because then the user can use their own styles.

422
00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:36.970
All right.

423
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.570
So it's all very well to make it update when the page loads.

424
00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:43.730
But we also wanted to update when the user updates their content.

425
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.160
And of course we want update it with their content.

426
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.990
Not my age general every time.

427
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:59.590
So first off let's get the contents of the HMO textarea.

428
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.090
So that's just

429
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:13.230
HMO panel and then Daut vow to get the value.

430
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:15.520
So let's just check that works.

431
00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.530
Excellent sites now updating there.

432
00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:22.850
What we'd really like is for this to update immediately as we're typing our code.

433
00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:28.420
And for that we need an event to trigger every time the text area was updated.

434
00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:30.890
So again that's something we haven't done before.

435
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.530
So let's see if there's a way to do it.

436
00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:42.050
Jay query if and when text area update something like that.

437
00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:46.340
How can I bind the change event of a textarea NJ query.

438
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.690
Gotta love stack overflow

439
00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:57.960
so that top result looks good but just having a look further down bind is deprecated.

440
00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:09.700
So this looks ideal for us so it selects a text area and then on certain events happening then a function

441
00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:17.230
will take place so that fairly obvious we've got change key up so that's when the user lifts their fingers

442
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:20.340
of a key or when the user pastes something in.

443
00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:29.910
So this should cover every event of our textarea changing.

444
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.600
So let's add that

445
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:44.820
code in so we can select all of our text areas even though we've only got one and when that happens

446
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.530
we want this

447
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:51.990
to update.

448
00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:52.970
Let's have a look.

449
00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:04.910
That's pretty awesome and we could even put some H.T. MLK in here.

450
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.500
And it will apply that immediately.

451
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:16.690
So this is pretty powerful.

452
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:22.660
Being able to do something as soon as the user changes the contents of a text area that would work just

453
00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.760
as well with an input as well.

454
00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:25.330
Great.

455
00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.120
So we're making pretty good progress.

456
00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:31.890
All we've got left to do is to bring in the CSSA and Javascript panels.

457
00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:33.570
So let's add them in

458
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:37.630
as text areas

459
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:49.920
so we want I see SS panel and a javascript panel

460
00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:58.710
and we'll have a little bit of demo see s and javascript's to get us started.

461
00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:03.790
So now javascript will just have alerts.

462
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.400
And in our C S

463
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:20.060
will have some green standard text or paragraph text.

464
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:20.710
Right.

465
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:28.130
And initially we want those to be hidden so let's have a hidden class

466
00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:33.010
which will have

467
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.850
a display property of none.

468
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:46.300
So if we have a look at that they won't display initially but what we want of course is that when we

469
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.070
click see SS have a C S S appears.

470
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:57.100
So we've already got a function that happens when the button the toggle button is clicked.

471
00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:03.090
So what we want to do is show or hide the respective panel when that button is clicked.

472
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.920
So there's a few things that will need for this.

473
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:13.240
Well need to get the ID of the panel that we want to show hide and to get that will need the ID of the

474
00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.430
button that was clicked.

475
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:25.550
So to get the idea of the button that was clicked we use this dot ETR for attributes and then Id And

476
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:32.740
then we're going to want to add the word panel onto the end of that because remember Olga HMO panel

477
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.860
CSSA panel et cetera.

478
00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:37.080
And there's a capital P there.

479
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.910
So to keep our code reasonably readable let's create

480
00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:52.420
a variable called panel ID which is going to be the ID of the panel that we going to show and hide.

481
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:58.570
And let's just alert it quickly to make sure that we've got the right thing.

482
00:39:58.610 --> 00:39:58.990
Yeah.

483
00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:00.930
That looks good.

484
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.950
OK.

485
00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:23.930
So then we can use the query selector to select hash and then panel ID and we want to toggle the class

486
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:38.790
and the class we want to toggle is what I call it hidden.

487
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.510
There we go.

488
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:42.660
So let's have a look if we now click here DML.

489
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:49.000
You can see the e-mail disappears and then it comes back wonderful.

490
00:40:49.150 --> 00:41:00.260
Incidentally there is actually a query function called Tuggle which just displays or Heights an element.

491
00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:05.380
So that's a little bit neater than Tuggle class in this case because you don't actually need the class

492
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:08.600
because the command is built into J-20.

493
00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:14.410
Now you might be anticipating a problem we're going to have but if we try and bring in the CSSA panel

494
00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:21.430
then that works great but it doesn't do is change our widths.

495
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:25.570
Obviously if you've got three panels each of which have a weight to 50 percent that's going to go over

496
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:28.990
the top with allowed on our page.

497
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:32.740
So we're going to need to make the panels narrower.

498
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.980
The more we have of them.

499
00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.290
Fortunately we have some code to do that.

500
00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.470
And that's this command here.

501
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.190
So this changes the panel with the problem is we're going to have to work out how many panels are being

502
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:51.530
displayed at any one time that we could do that with a variable and then keep track of it an app onto

503
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:55.310
it and subtract 1 to it each time an item is toggled.

504
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:58.130
But I think there's a slightly neater way to do it.

505
00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:04.850
And that is if we could find a way in Jey query to count the number of elements with a certain class

506
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:08.000
that would give us the answer that we needed.

507
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:15.410
So if we make that class hidden and go back from toggle to so-called class

508
00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:25.440
so it was useful after all and we could count the number that are hidden and subtract that from 4 to

509
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.570
get the number that are active.

510
00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.620
So let's see if we can find a way to do that.

511
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:41.400
Jay equerry count elements with a certain class counting elements by class.

512
00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:47.560
That Let's get and there we go.

513
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:53.750
Once again we see how easy and obvious Jake is we just use something like that.

514
00:42:54.120 --> 00:43:01.660
So we select the class that we want and then we look for the length of that variable and that will tell

515
00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.780
us the number of items.

516
00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:08.000
With that class.

517
00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:16.190
So let's create another variable called number of active panels.

518
00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:23.270
And that's going to be equal to 4 which is our maximum possible take away

519
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:37.300
the number of inactive panels which is the panels with the hidden class.

520
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:45.510
And then instead of subtracting by dividing by two we're going to divide by the number of active panels.

521
00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:53.160
So that should divide by two initially and then three if we have three four if we have all four.

522
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.100
Let's take a look.

523
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:56.530
Excellent.

524
00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:59.460
So now it's dividing it into three panels.

525
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:06.400
Add in javascript and we get all four fabulous people at that there some quite complicated code there

526
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:10.580
for free to rewind the video and just watch that but again if it's a little bit unclear.

527
00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:11.660
OK.

528
00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:16.510
We can now see that we've got some slight issues with our borders then.

529
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:21.640
So I'm just going to change panels to have a left border

530
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:25.200
of none

531
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:34.490
It's just have a look great that looks a lot better.

532
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:42.360
And there's also one issue that you might have imagined that if we get rid of them all then we are dividing

533
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:46.010
by four takeaway for which is 0 3.

534
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:52.140
Fortunately this doesn't cause us a major problem because it means the javascript won't do anything

535
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:56.250
here but we don't need it to resize the width anyway because we've hidden everything.

536
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.410
So actually it doesn't really matter.

537
00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:04.710
And we can just bring them back in in the same way as before.

538
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.500
All right so we're pretty close now.

539
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:13.980
We need to do is to get our styles and javascript to happen in this I-frame here.

540
00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:17.680
So let's head on down to where we would want that to happen.

541
00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:25.130
So at the moment we're just putting in the contents of the HMO textarea.

542
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.580
So this can be a little bit messy but it'll get the job done.

543
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:39.310
What I'm going to day is manually put in our two main page to insert our styles and our Javascript.

544
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:45.770
So I'm going to start with page Jamail and then head.

545
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:49.000
We don't need a title because we're not displaying that anyway.

546
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:52.390
But we do need some styles.

547
00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:59.700
So I'm going to have style and then type equals and I'm going to use single quotes because I'm using

548
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:07.800
double quotes for this whole string and the type is text slash C S

549
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:27.990
and then I'm going to put in LCS S which is the contents of the C Ss panel that says panel Val and then

550
00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.740
I'm going to end my styles.

551
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.610
I'm going to end my head.

552
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:34.920
I'm going to start my body.

553
00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:49.970
Then I'm going to have my HMO and I'm going to leave the javascript for the moment for reasons that

554
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.960
we'll see in a couple of minutes.

555
00:46:52.370 --> 00:47:04.170
But for now now that I've got my body content I'm going to close the body and close the HDL.

556
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:10.190
So this should essentially create an inline HVM l page with this content.

557
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:16.080
So I started with HVM L then head then it should put in all the styles that we've got in our CSSA text

558
00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:17.290
area here.

559
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:24.440
Then it closed the stiles closes the head starts the body puts the h d m l panel content in and then

560
00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:31.610
closes the body and closes ASTM else it will create a kind of full HD our page with the content and

561
00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:32.840
styling there.

562
00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.060
Let's not forget the close parenthesis there.

563
00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:43.850
And now we should find then that the HMO of the contents of our I-frame should be updated to a full

564
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:52.520
HMO file essentially with h d m l and then a header with the style and then the styles of the CSSA panel

565
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:53.730
inserted there.

566
00:47:53.830 --> 00:48:00.530
Close the style close the head and start the body then put the HD M-L panel contents in there and then

567
00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.140
close the body close the HD m-L.

568
00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.610
So just to check that that is happening.

569
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:13.230
Let's update the HDMI out panel contents to contain a paragraph tag.

570
00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:19.230
Otherwise the styles won't be applied to them again.

571
00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.920
And now let's have a look.

572
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:25.400
So we should now find when we update this as we go.

573
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:32.020
Now the styles are being applied as well as the content.

574
00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:32.500
Great.

575
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:37.060
We want LOT of course to happen on page load as well.

576
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:45.730
So one solution to do that would be to copy our I-frame code and replace the update that we had at the

577
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:46.960
beginning with that.

578
00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.070
But as we've seen we don't like having two chunks of code that are exactly the same.

579
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:55.090
So what I'm going to do is create a function

580
00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.460
called update output

581
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:12.980
pretty straightforward and that we'll just do the updating and then we can call that both at the start

582
00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:20.820
of the page when the page is loaded and when we have any updates.

583
00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:28.670
So now when we run we should find yet we get the styles applied as well on the initial set up.

584
00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:32.050
So now all that remains is our Javascript.

585
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:36.870
And this is you might have gathered is going to be slightly more complicated than applying the CSSA.

586
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:43.510
So what we can do is just add a script tag here you can feel free to try it and it might even work in

587
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:48.370
some browsers but it definitely doesn't work in the version of crime that I'm working with here and

588
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:54.850
that's primarily for security reasons running Javascript within an I-frame is not considered ideal and

589
00:49:54.850 --> 00:50:00.280
in fact if you were making this site live and allowing people to actually use it you'd want to be very

590
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:06.580
careful about what javascript they were allowed to run here because there are potentially ways to start

591
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:10.750
running code on your server through a site like this.

592
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:15.010
If you did have a project that did something like that and you wanted to do it securely there's plenty

593
00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:15.870
of help out there.

594
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.340
Google something like run javascript in I-frame securely or something like that.

595
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:29.050
The main thing is to bear in mind that executing javascript that your users can edit in an I-frame on

596
00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:34.930
your server is a little bit risky and you should take some security precautions.

597
00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:39.100
All right so first off how do we execute this javascript at all.

598
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:45.310
What if we just wanted to run some random javascript that the user has entered.

599
00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.710
This is something that we haven't done before.

600
00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:57.400
So let's try searching for something like run a javascript string something like that because essentially

601
00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:03.060
what we've got is a string and we want to run it as javascript's.

602
00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:08.540
OK that avowe function looks like it does what we need

603
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.100
OK then tested.

604
00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:17.440
So if owl just evaluates a string of javascript

605
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:24.430
fabulous that looks like it could be very useful for us.

606
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:28.110
So let's try adding that to our update outputs.

607
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.090
Function so well just now.

608
00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:43.270
And the thing we want to evaluate is the contents of the JavaScript panel so let's get those.

609
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:49.490
I will select the javascript panel and get the value

610
00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.150
right.

611
00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.100
And that actually did nothing.

612
00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:57.870
Why is that.

613
00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.000
Ah yes you can see.

614
00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:08.110
You may spotted my deliberate mistake there I forgot to close the double quotes on my javascript alert

615
00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:09.110
function.

616
00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:10.250
So let's try that again.

617
00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.480
There we go.

618
00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:12.100
Right.

619
00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:19.330
So we're running our javascript which is great but we're not quite done yet because we're running the

620
00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:24.630
javascript on the original site at the moment and we want to run it in the I-frame.

621
00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:29.470
That was something like an alert that doesn't make any difference but if the user actually wanted to

622
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:35.650
update or do something with the contents of that I-frame then that wouldn't work here because we're

623
00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:39.640
running the javascript in the original page not within the I-frame.

624
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:44.980
So we need to run the javascript code on the I-frame itself.

625
00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.850
Again that's something that we haven't done before.

626
00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:51.360
Let's see if we can figure out how to do it.

627
00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:55.450
I think we're going to be using the evolved command.

628
00:52:55.450 --> 00:53:01.700
So let's try yvel javascript within I-frame something like that.

629
00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.750
OK that first one looks pretty promising.

630
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:13.780
Any way of getting javascript injected into an I-frame without removing and reappointing it.

631
00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.810
That is indeed what we want today.

632
00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:24.220
OK so this is looking promising we can take the I-frame and look at the content window.

633
00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:28.210
So looking at that we can get the I-frame we can already do that.

634
00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:36.430
We then get the French content window which is I wind in this example and then we apply the Evaluate

635
00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:39.830
function to that OK.

636
00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:41.940
That looks like just what we want to see.

637
00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:46.040
So let's do it using good old fashioned

638
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:59.060
javascript I-frame have an ID of output panel so we can use our old friend get element by id and then

639
00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:09.030
I hash an output panel and then looking over here we want to use content

640
00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:19.130
window to access the content window that the contents of the I-frame itself.

641
00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.210
And then we want to evolve our code.

642
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:26.650
In fact we can just copy this

643
00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:34.170
and that will do essentially the same as what we had before.

644
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:42.640
But it will evaluate the code within the I-frame itself not on the initial page.

645
00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:48.380
And just before we run that mother might have made a mistake there confusing my query and javascript

646
00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:53.510
which is very easily done with javascript here because we're getting an element by ID we don't need

647
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:58.180
to put the hash in we just put the ID itself in.

648
00:54:58.190 --> 00:55:01.910
All right let's take a look around.

649
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:08.600
So our javascript is being run would be good to have confirmation that it is indeed being run inside

650
00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.190
the I-frame.

651
00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:12.900
So let's just quickly do that.

652
00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:25.980
We could give our paragraph here an ID of paragraph and then we could edit our javascript code so that

653
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:28.410
it just changed the contents of the paragraph

654
00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:32.160
instead of alerting something.

655
00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:38.950
And then if that works we know that our javascript is being executed inside the I-frame.

656
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:39.940
So let's do that.

657
00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:46.300
We want documents to get elements by ID.

658
00:55:46.300 --> 00:56:01.560
The idea here is paragraph and then we want to change the HVM El to use my classic alternative.

659
00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:03.540
Hello Rob.

660
00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:05.290
All right.

661
00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:06.560
So I've got that correct.

662
00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:09.820
And it should update when I refresh.

663
00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:10.980
It does indeed.

664
00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:12.620
Fantastic.

665
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.310
So that's it.

666
00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:16.600
We've achieved our objective.

667
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:19.300
We have a really quite nice looking site.

668
00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:28.810
Pretty simple but it looks good we can toggle the HDMI SS javascript and output on and off as we want.

669
00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:39.950
And then as soon as we update any of these the updates are immediately reflected in the output there.

670
00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.160
Billiam So there's our code Pleyel.

671
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:54.180
As always I hope you manage to do most of that yourself and enjoy the process of putting it together.

672
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:56.820
This brings us to the end of the jay queery section.

673
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.590
So once again give yourself a pat on the back.

674
00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:04.260
But brace yourself because we're soon going to find out how to make great looking Responsive Web sites.

675
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:10.120
That is ones that respond immediately to the user's screen size and display a different layout depending

676
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.330
on whether they're on their phone or tablet or their computer.

677
00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:19.630
We're going to do that using a completely free framework called Bootstrap and that's all coming in the

678
00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:20.670
next section.

679
00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.340
See them.
