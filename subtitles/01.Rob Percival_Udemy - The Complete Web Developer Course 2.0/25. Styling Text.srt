1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,060
Now that we know how to set the font of our text we're going to look at styling it in other ways so

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,260
this is making text bold underlining it's making it taluk and a lot more.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,960
We did of course see how to do that in the HVM L section but I hope that you're reasonably convinced

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,870
that it's best generally to keep styles separate from content.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,740
So rather than using strong for example to have some bold text we're better off putting that information

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,290
in our stylesheet so that we can apply it to multiple styles and update it and manage our website much

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,740
more easily.

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,550
So lets start off indeed with some bold and I'm going to get rid of this Google fonts just to avoid

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,020
any confusion.

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,070
And so let's see how we make our text bold.

11
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,340
It's pretty easy.

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,310
We use font white.

13
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:59,550
Now we can be really precise with our font white and use a particular number or we can use one of the

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,870
standard options.

15
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:11,750
And I would normally for bold go for bold so that will set our text to be bold.

16
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,250
So what about it taluk text.

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:25,830
Well first off let's just switch this to a class so that we can have a nice reference for you with lots

18
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,630
of different types of text formatting.

19
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,140
So we'll have it Salik there.

20
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,240
It's going to be some taluk text

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:52,920
and then dot taluk to select that class and for a taluk we use font style and we got normal there which

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,210
is the standard oblique.

23
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,010
And we're going to be doing it like again.

24
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,190
So bold and italic.

25
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,970
Now I'm going to set you a quick challenge.

26
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,650
I'm going to put an extra bit of text here saying this.

27
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:14,670
And this is bold and italic and I'd like you to somehow.

28
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,250
Any way you like make that sentence both bold and italic.

29
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,110
Go for it.

30
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,520
I you managed it.

31
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,030
I hope you used some sort of a span

32
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,750
around that sentence.

33
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:44,720
And then I think the easiest way to do it is just to apply the bold class to that span and then the

34
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,280
span will be both bold and taluk because it's part of the paragraph.

35
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,270
That's it.

36
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,380
There we go.

37
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,610
But if you had a separate class for that one which is bold and italic that's fine but you've kind of

38
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,220
made a taluk twice because it was already a taluk from the paragraph tag.

39
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:04,710
All right.

40
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,140
The third new type I'm going to show you is underlining.

41
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,980
So let's just copy that and we'll have a class of underline

42
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:27,380
and we'll have this text is underlined and it's pretty easy to do once again so underlined to select

43
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:36,700
that and then text decoration and underline

44
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,870
like there you go.

45
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,940
So those are the three major types of text styling that you're likely to use.

46
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,720
As it happens I probably use text decoration.

47
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,810
None more often than I use underline because quite often I want my links not to be underlined.

48
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,550
And let's just have a quick look.

49
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,370
Well have an empty link there.

50
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,560
This is a link.

51
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,670
So by default of course links are underlined.

52
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,590
If as is the style of many web sites these days you don't want your links to be underlined.

53
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,140
Then you would just set an instruction in your CSSA for all links.

54
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,110
That is.

55
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,980
And set the text decoration to none.

56
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,460
That's a really handy thing to do to stop your links being underlined.

57
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,050
But just to confuse things or avoid confusion we'll set that back to underlined.

58
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:47,980
So this is a non underlined link.

59
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,520
There you have one cheeky trick.

60
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,510
I'm going to show you is allowing a link to be underlined when the mouse hovers over it which is quite

61
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:05,430
a nice way of just confirming to the user that this is indeed a link and you can do that using what's

62
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:14,490
known as a pseudo selector which is styling a link in a certain condition.

63
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:21,400
So this will style the link when it's it's harvest state i.e. the user is hovering the mouse over it.

64
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,890
So we can then bring in text decoration underline for that.

65
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,850
Let's have a look.

66
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:37,080
Now when we bring the mouse over it's underlined and we could even change the color if we wanted to.

67
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,140
For some reason we could make it underlined and green when the user hovers over it.

68
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,070
OK.

69
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,260
The one last one I'm going to show you is one that we've definitely seen before

70
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,300
which is making text big

71
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:07,580
and we do that with the font size property and we can make that whatever we like.

72
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:15,790
Normally I'd go for something like 200 percent to make it twice as big as normal.

73
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,270
There we get a nice big text.

74
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,380
And of course we've seen coloring as well.

75
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,500
So those are the basics.

76
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,550
Those are definitely the ones I would use on a day to day basis but there are a lot more to show you

77
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:35,420
a few of them are Google something like CSSA dialing text.

78
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:42,360
And then again W3 schools comes up with the top and they've got a few ones that we're used to so text

79
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:42,880
color.

80
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:49,630
We know all about that's text alignment we're actually looking at in the next video and then text decoration.

81
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,390
So this is underlining or not underlining.

82
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,600
And there's a few other options there as well over a line or line at the top and line three you can

83
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,070
transform your text into all uppercase or lowercase if you want to indent the first line.

84
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,760
You can change the spacing between letters.

85
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,160
Change the line height even change the text decoration if you really want to.

86
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,020
And word spacing can be changed there as well.

87
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,680
So you can really completely customize the way your text looks.

88
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,080
Using some pretty basic CSSA great.

89
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,440
So that's how we customize the style of our text in the video.

90
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:35,060
I mentioned we're going to see how we can align our text very easily to have it left aligned right aligned

91
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,740
centered or justified.
