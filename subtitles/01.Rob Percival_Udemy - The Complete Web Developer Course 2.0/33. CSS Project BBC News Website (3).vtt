00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.810
Say things are coming along nicely.

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.250
We've got to have top up and running and that fits nicely with our menu bar as well.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.490
We've got our two shades and all our menu links are set up beautifully.

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.490
So in this the third video of the BBC news client We're going to be recreating essentially this box

5
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.780
here.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.240
The left part with technology at the top and then bottom right we've got this big image.

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.850
So let's start as always at the top left and work our way down.

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.760
So this technology with the red underline isn't actually a link which is slightly odd but ours is not

9
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.150
a reason why it's to recreate.

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.760
So let's get things moving.

11
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.490
We're out of the menu bar to contain it.

12
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.810
Dave now so we're going to need a clear

13
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.100
so let's set that up.

14
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.120
And then we'll have

15
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:19.340
an idea of we'll call it main article if that's what it seems to be.

16
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.460
So we don't want to set a width for this main article and we want it to float to the left because we're

17
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.050
going to have another section on the right there which is going to float.

18
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.990
Right.

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.440
But the width of the whole section again is the same as the whole page.

20
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:42.810
So let's actually create a container which once again is a thousand pixels wide and scented.

21
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.200
So let's have a div

22
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.220
I'll call it page contain it because it would actually contain the whole page if we were going to write

23
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.460
the whole thing

24
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.500
so the page container is

25
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.670
same as what we've seen before.

26
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:19.070
Which is to say it's a thousand pixels wide and it's got a margin 0 top and bottom and auto left and

27
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.510
right so nice unscented

28
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.520
OK.

29
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.470
And then the main optical part is going to go on the left we'll sort out the floating and everything

30
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.650
else a bit later on but we'll start with an H.

31
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:42.020
We've already used H-1 so have h H-2 and that will be our technology.

32
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.260
So let's just have a quick look and see how that looks.

33
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.510
Ok fine definitely a little bit out of position there but that can be easily changed.

34
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.350
So to any one of them we don't need to give it a particular class.

35
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.730
We want to be definitely not bold a bit smaller and then red underlined.

36
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.430
So we'll have font white normal

37
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.390
on top.

38
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.000
Let's try 40 pixels and

39
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.140
let's try font size of 20 pixels.

40
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.390
See how that looks.

41
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.130
OK.

42
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.190
Pretty good.

43
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.530
So that's aligned right to the left which is what we wanted.

44
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.590
We were aligned with the news.

45
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.750
Now we want to achieve this red underline here but I think it's not actually an underline it looks more

46
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.390
to me like a border.

47
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.530
So I'm going to grab the color first of

48
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.340
which I think is actually the same color as we've used before.

49
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.140
That dark red

50
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.120
and then it looks quite thick so maybe four pixels.

51
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:09.150
Let's try Borda bottom for peaks solid Not quite but color with hay in front of it.

52
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.430
Let's take a look.

53
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.170
All right.

54
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.210
So that's pretty good.

55
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.250
I think it's maybe a little bit too thick.

56
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.190
Let's try to pixels.

57
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.900
OK.

58
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.380
That looks a lot better.

59
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.930
And let's set the width of the H2.

60
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:40.050
So it's about the right size.

61
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.950
All right Nancy.

62
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.950
OK.

63
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.180
There we go.

64
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.980
Great.

65
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.230
So now we've got our technology that's have our.

66
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.570
This is going to be a three link and this is going to be our title

67
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:15.410
says H-3 it's a link we don't care where it goes and there's the content.

68
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.630
So let's have a little look how it seems.

69
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.820
Ok I quite like the spacing that's about right.

70
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.020
We need definitely different colors.

71
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.400
But it's roughly in the right place.

72
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.740
I think we need it to be a little bit larger as well.

73
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.650
So let's take out H-3.

74
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:45.040
I was starting a link within H-3 and we definitely want the color to be black.

75
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.090
We want the font size to be around let's try 20 pixels see how that looks.

76
00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.620
I think we could get it bigger than that

77
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.690
OK I like that.

78
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.290
I think that's about right.

79
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.310
And we want to get rid of that underline so text decoration.

80
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.220
None

81
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.600
OK.

82
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.010
Excellent.

83
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.320
And we also want to make sure that it goes to that blue on the cover.

84
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.460
So let's get the right color.

85
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.470
Difficult to do.

86
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:40.840
Back with.

87
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.240
Come on if you're not behaving today.

88
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:50.100
Maybe I can persuade.

89
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.100
It's not happy about that.

90
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.950
I can't see if I can use the inspectors.

91
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.260
I right click or control click.

92
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:17.740
Come on click sorry and inspect and then it might give us the hover color if we're lucky.

93
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.330
There we go.

94
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.610
I think that's it.

95
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:27.050
They're let's copy that's called phone block link Hov presumably so that looks promising

96
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.710
OK so we're going to start using H-3.

97
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.670
And then

98
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.430
and we wanted to be the same as above.

99
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.950
But with that particular color

100
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:57.370
wonderful Okay storming along.

101
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.040
All right now we've got this part down the left.

102
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.570
So I think we can use a nice paragraph for that

103
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:13.990
one to try and copy it without clicking on the link icon to that song and to inspect it

104
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.610
and copy it from the code.

105
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.460
So I think it's here in the body Basit summary

106
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.420
gay select.

107
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.020
That's

108
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.670
And

109
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.750
then let's pop that in.

110
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.970
So we're still in the main article here.

111
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:52.040
I think we need a div called Article summary.

112
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.490
And then the code let's have a look.

113
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.070
Great.

114
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:11.020
I wonder if we can get it to tell us the color so I'm going to click on the arrow there.

115
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.210
And then find the bit that I want to if I can extract the color

116
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.890
say that Paul Van and it's if computed.

117
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:33.170
And I think that's the Khala not quite that we.

118
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:38.410
Yeah it is the same say 5:35 a thigh of a

119
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.240
thing the actual size looks about right to me.

120
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.540
So article summary

121
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.470
K is color.

122
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.910
Is that wonderful.

123
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.140
Now we want to change the with a little

124
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:15.280
so let's reduce the width to let's try 200 pixels see how that looks.

125
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:25.420
That put together a little bit wider maybe 220.

126
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.870
I that's close enough that the spacing of that font is a little wider than ours but I think we can live

127
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:32.820
with that.

128
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:33.820
Okay.

129
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:41.370
And then underneath we've got this little timer here I can't right click and download it so I'll need

130
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.710
to a screen grab.

131
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:50.710
So same as usual let's go back and grab it.

132
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.660
There it is.

133
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:57.050
I'll call it clock copy it's command see control see.

134
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.920
And paste it into images.

135
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.690
There we.

136
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:11.880
So we just need the clock and then the date and then a line and then technology easy

137
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.580
say I'll do that as a paragraph

138
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.670
and then we'll have a new paragraph for our clock

139
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:42.710
images flash clocked up PND and then our date which was currently the 19th of January 2016

140
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:54.560
and I'll see what happens I'll try writing a pipe which should be over to the right of your keyboard.

141
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:59.130
Near the end the button will see if that looks right.

142
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.960
I think it might do but we might have to use a margin there.

143
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.610
If it's too narrow and then we've got a link

144
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.360
which says tech Knology

145
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.040
OK.

146
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.370
That looks pretty good.

147
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.790
Definitely need a bit of styling them.

148
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.890
We can do that without any new classes I think.

149
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:37.020
So this is all within article summary so we can have article summary and then image as any one of those

150
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:42.810
and that's the clock say let's change the height to let's try 15 pixels.

151
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.420
I think that's just about right.

152
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.770
And I want to move it down slightly it's a little bit higher up.

153
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.350
So let's use a relative position

154
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:08.620
and top much try three pixels too much to pixels.

155
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:09.550
Great.

156
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.920
Okay perfect.

157
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:17.350
Now of course we have a problem because our with with two now.

158
00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:23.330
So let's increase the width of the article summary a little bit so that it can bring in the bottom part

159
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:23.690
as well.

160
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.600
That's great.

161
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.540
Okay.

162
00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.060
And then let style link

163
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.620
so what color do we want it to be first off.

164
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.650
It's the same red as the other red I think and then on Hulver it goes the same blue.

165
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.110
By the looks of it as they head up that

166
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.690
say let's take off the underline first so text decoration.

167
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.220
None.

168
00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:06.460
And then color that's fine that red was the same as the bottom border on the page too.

169
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.050
So that number should do it

170
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.650
that's Have a wonderful and then we just need to

171
00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:28.960
change the whole show which is actually going to be the same as that but instead of H-3 we want article

172
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.710
summary I hava.

173
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.160
So now when we hope that it goes really brilliant.

174
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.740
I don't quite like my hyphen though.

175
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.900
I don't think it looks as good as that does.

176
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:48.390
It's going to be slightly trickier than just putting in a pipe but not to worry.

177
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.670
Let's make it a left border on the technology link

178
00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.740
so Botha left Stephanie one pixel saw it.

179
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.790
And I think it's the same gray as the gray up here.

180
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.950
So let's scroll up and find that that was out C's

181
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.740
So I put that in that

182
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.110
have a look.

183
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.340
OK.

184
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.090
So you get that looks a lot better.

185
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.620
But we need to add in a little bit of padding.

186
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.710
Let's try 10 picks.

187
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.520
OK.

188
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.650
That looks right.

189
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.190
But

190
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.980
it's now too big let's see if it's still too big.

191
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.420
After we've done that OK it's not.

192
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.400
But we now need to add padding to that bit there.

193
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:04.490
So let's put a span with an ID of diked and that just means that we can put a little bit of padding

194
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:13.370
to the right of it so that the border there isn't flush with the 2016

195
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.880
date we want padding.

196
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.180
Right.

197
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.740
Let's have the same as what we had for the technology link tempy x.

198
00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:25.850
OK.

199
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:33.240
I think that looks great but we do now need to make how article summary div a little wider.

200
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.240
Beautiful OK.

201
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:37.940
I'm very happy with all of that.

202
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.370
Now all we need to add for this part is the image here.

203
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:52.570
So I'm going to control click or right click and I can't even do it then.

204
00:16:52.680 --> 00:17:00.810
So the image is in the CSF somewhere we could figure it out but it's probably easier or at least quicker

205
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:05.150
to just screenshot it.

206
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:10.820
Memba if you can do that for any reason then just grab it from the download in the next video.

207
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.210
OK.

208
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.560
There it is.

209
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:26.610
I'll call it main article image and then we'll copy that straight into images for them.

210
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.860
Get rid of that.

211
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.940
So this is going to be to the right of this section here.

212
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:45.100
So we're going to want to float all of that left.

213
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.770
So let's make that happen.

214
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:55.180
I think what we'll do is underneath technology because technology goes all the way across.

215
00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.060
So we'll create a new device to contain the article there.

216
00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.830
Then that's the bit that can float left for us.

217
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.250
So I leave technology as is and then we'll have a Dave with an ID of

218
00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:13.570
article contain up

219
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.010
and that can guide

220
00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:32.530
that and we'll indent everything inside that lovely article contained and needs to have a certain width

221
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:39.800
and it needs to float left as well and so does article summary.

222
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.400
So let's just make that happen.

223
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:48.870
So article summary already has a fixed width so let's make it float.

224
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.780
Left and then Article container

225
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:06.910
we were on that flight left and we want a fixed width let's go for maybe 600 pixels.

226
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:13.910
It's going to be a bit more than half or carry just make sure we haven't given anything too much there

227
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.950
yet that looks fine but a bit more spacing than we had before but that might actually work out better.

228
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:25.300
Let's put everything else in and see.

229
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.440
So then to the right of article summary we're going to have the image that's what we have here is say

230
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.610
let's just put it straight in

231
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.980
main article image.

232
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.890
There it is.

233
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.260
And let's just see how it looks without any styling at all.

234
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.840
He little bit too big.

235
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.160
So like give it an ID of main article image

236
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.850
and then let's add it up here.

237
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:13.180
So the main thing we need to do is reduce the width Let's try 300 pixels.

238
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.840
OK.

239
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.460
That actually looks pretty good.

240
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.380
OK.

241
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.160
I'm happy with that.

242
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.510
I think it's a bit bigger in real life.

243
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:31.110
So let's go for 400 pixels.

244
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.720
OK that's now too big for the container but that's all right.

245
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.560
We can make the container a bit wider.

246
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.650
OK.

247
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:41.610
I think that looks good.

248
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.660
Maybe not exactly the same size but close enough.

249
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:52.140
I'd like to see a little bit more gap between the image and the text down there.

250
00:20:52.140 --> 00:21:00.430
So let's give it a little margin left of maybe 20 pixels OK.

251
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.000
You might have guessed that was going to happen.

252
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.720
Let's give that another 20 pixels.

253
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.500
Great.

254
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.110
So that looks pretty awesome to me.

255
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:19.780
The only thing I want to add are these two links down here a little line there.

256
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.370
And then our border to the right there.

257
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.150
OK.

258
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:30.190
So let's start our way down here so that one is actually quite easy to put in we can use a horizontal

259
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:39.360
rule and we'll do this after the technology link.

260
00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.980
So he horizontal rule

261
00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.410
and I think we should give it an ID.

262
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:58.860
I'll call it article AJAM.

263
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.910
So the main thing we need to change is the color and the width.

264
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:07.690
So the color is going to be the same as this red in technology.

265
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:17.830
Which I believe was that carry that.

266
00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:23.040
And then that's OK for a width of 50 pixels.

267
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.090
See how that looks.

268
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:26.490
Excellent.

269
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.590
Couple of minor issues there.

270
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.910
It's centered rather than left aligned.

271
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.690
And it's not actually red.

272
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:38.670
So let's have a look and see if we can fix those.

273
00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.590
Let's look at how we might align and H.R. first of

274
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:53.610
OK so we can add in a line that was left into the H.R. itself.

275
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.120
Let's try that out.

276
00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.050
OK.

277
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.130
That solved that problem.

278
00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.110
And let's see if we can see what's wrong.

279
00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:12.450
Changing the color of an H element Yep so setting the color as we've had doesn't work.

280
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:20.350
OK so I think we need to use border color instead of color for the HRO.

281
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:32.020
So let's set it as border top as I've done this one Pick-Axe solid and then that.

282
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.290
Excellent.

283
00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.890
So now it looks a lot like the one

284
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.160
get aligned nicely in the real thing.

285
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.860
Wonderful.

286
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:54.110
OK I'm just going to copy those two links so those links are pretty similar to the technology link but

287
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.780
they're black rather than red.

288
00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.340
Shouldn't be a problem.

289
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.470
Let's put them in here sir.

290
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.350
I think Tref is empty again.

291
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.770
Clays I think we'll put them in separate paragraphs as well.

292
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.600
And then let's just copy and paste that for the

293
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:27.120
second link.

294
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:27.640
T.

295
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.300
Ok fine.

296
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.050
But they're inheriting those styles as well.

297
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:44.510
I think because this is a more unique link than this one we should actually give this an ID

298
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.390
even though we didn't need to before.

299
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:54.880
Say ID equals

300
00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:04.570
let's call it a topic link because it seems to be linking to technology which is the topic that we're

301
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:05.340
looking at.

302
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:13.310
And then we want to put all of this into a topic like

303
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:21.000
that we can so that now works fine.

304
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.270
We just need to style these.

305
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.740
So I think we'll give them a class of their own as well.

306
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.590
I'll just call them article link

307
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.210
gay

308
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:52.040
and we don't need a lot of styling for them but we need to set

309
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.500
the color to black

310
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.770
and we need to set the text decoration.

311
00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.560
None.

312
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:13.670
We've already got the right coloring on the HAVA.

313
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.270
So I think that's close enough.

314
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:25.520
We now just need to add the border on the right there which is the classic one X solid gray.

315
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.280
We're familiar with that by now.

316
00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:31.600
And we're going to add that to the article container.

317
00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.580
So border right kind of what one picks solid and

318
00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.310
can we find the right color.

319
00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:46.930
It's

320
00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:52.490
the topic link.

321
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:56.110
There it is on the border left link.

322
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.780
Article contained a one piece solid and then that color

323
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:17.120
ok looks very good but of course it needs to be spread out a little bit so let's add a bit of padding.

324
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.400
Try 20 pixels.

325
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:24.380
Wonderful.

326
00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.120
There we go.

327
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.150
So we're pretty darn close now.

328
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.150
We've got our left main block added.

329
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.760
So all that remains is to add.

330
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.800
I'll watch listen section down here on the right.

331
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.650
And that shouldn't be too tricky at all.

332
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:43.680
Fingers crossed.

333
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.590
We'll do that in the next video.

334
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.040
See it at.
