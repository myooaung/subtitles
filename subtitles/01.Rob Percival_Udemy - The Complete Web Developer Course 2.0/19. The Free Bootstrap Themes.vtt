1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.150
So one of the mini van tactic extras you get with the complete web developer of course is the complete

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.840
set of official bootstrap themes.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.280
You can check these out themes don't get bootstrapped or come.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.480
They usually cause $99 each.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.970
You can download all three of them for free with this course and use them as many times as you like.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.050
So in this video I'm just going to show you how to get ahold of them and how to make very basic edits

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.860
that you can start building your own sites with them.

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.310
The first theme is a dashboard theme.

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.110
So the sort of thing you might see when you're logged into a web app of some kind shows the user some

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.150
stats about their Web site or whatever it is.

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.410
The app is doing for them.

12
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.320
So there's some really cool stuff in there.

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.610
And of course it all uses bootstrap so super editable and you can add any of the features that we've

14
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.940
seen in this section very easily to it.

15
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.020
The second one is a marketing web site.

16
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.560
So a little bit similar to the one that we created in the previous video.

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.470
But I think it looks quite a bit better.

18
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.900
To be fair it's been designed by the makers of bootstrap themselves.

19
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.050
So it's pretty good.

20
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.850
And finally the last one is a kind of social media application theme so if you're wanting to build the

21
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.070
next Facebook or Twitter itself then this would be a great start.

22
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.730
So how do you get them.

23
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.770
Well once you've signed up to either web hosting and verified your purchase of the course then you just

24
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.200
go to either web hosting or current UK slash C.P. slash profile.

25
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.980
If you haven't signed or tweak or web hosting yet then follow the instructions to do that.

26
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.100
In the video at the beginning of the course and just scroll all the way down and right at the bottom

27
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.530
you'll see three official bootstrap themes worth $297.

28
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.630
So they are downloadable from here so all you need to do is click the link and that will then open up

29
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.900
a download box which you just save directly to your computer.

30
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.400
Incidentally the themes are vaguely updated and I'll put the latest version whatever it is here.

31
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.020
So if you're making 8 a site in a few years time with these bootstrap themes you might want to come

32
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.820
back and download the latest version.

33
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.280
All right.

34
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.210
When that's downloaded just go over to find the old Windows Explorer and find the file there it is bootstrapped

35
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:23.800
themes top zip and then double click it to unzip it and then you'll see all three themes.

36
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.230
Here we go.

37
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.310
So we'll have a quick look at the application one first.

38
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.650
And you can see we've got a number of folders there but the one we're really interested in is the Docs

39
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.380
folder.

40
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.320
And then we're going to open up index Rached DML in crime

41
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.280
and then you can see the Web site exactly as it looks in the picture on theme's don't get bootstrapped.

42
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.960
So it's obviously all completely interactive.

43
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.860
You can start typing in the search boxes.

44
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.860
In fact if you click in the search box expands quite fancily like that if you click out get smaller

45
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.170
again and of course being bootstrap it's completely responsive.

46
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.660
So it changes its design and you even get this dropdown menu effect when you get into the phone screen

47
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.190
size

48
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.600
to edit it then it's pretty straightforward.

49
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:26.720
You just open up that index so the HDMI will file in your text editor of choice and you can see it's

50
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:35.210
got a couple of its own CSSA files and then all the content is right here as you would expect if you

51
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.790
wanted to change.

52
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.720
It might be time to visit Iceland link then you can do that.

53
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.620
Or just command and control have to find it.

54
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.290
And there it is or just but it might not be time to visit Iceland.

55
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.330
And there we go.

56
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.390
It updates obviously right away.

57
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.490
So it's pretty simple.

58
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.070
It's a great looking theme that you could use for a huge range of applications.

59
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.550
Let's have a little look at the other see

60
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.570
the dashboard.

61
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.730
Once again we're going to look in docks and we're going to open up indexed raged here mail in crime.

62
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.590
And there it is.

63
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.830
So we've got the date picker built in.

64
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.130
We've got some stats some nicely customized progress bars.

65
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.260
Some neatly styled buttons others et cetera.

66
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:46.520
You can even with this one customize the circle that whatever you want it to be it's not an image say

67
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:54.060
if we open it up in text it's to look for new versus returning

68
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.220
and you get you can say it's a donut chart.

69
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:10.960
So if we changed this to 30 for example and the other one to 130 or leave it as it is then that will

70
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.090
update automatically.

71
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.960
And even these graph curves here are not images we can customize those as well.

72
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:29.680
So if we have a look for page views and we get you can see that this is being created by a canvas which

73
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.650
is an HMO L5 element that we haven't seen yet but we will look at in the HCM L5 section towards the

74
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.400
end of the course.

75
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.120
And essentially it allows you to draw anything on your page including a graph.

76
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:49.420
So if for example I crank up that first result to a 90 and we should see the beginning of this line

77
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.420
you get increase right there.

78
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.530
So once again great looking theme really powerful.

79
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.670
And if you want to make a nice looking dashboard for your web app it's a great place to start.

80
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.710
Finally then let's have a look at the Third Theme included.

81
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.710
This is the marketing theme.

82
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:16.040
So once again we'll look in the docs folder and then we'll open index to out in crime and here we go.

83
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.680
So this is actually four themes in one.

84
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.090
So we'll start with the startup theme.

85
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.530
Again this is created using code.

86
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.200
Although the camera is an image that that's fair enough.

87
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.830
And then we've got a really nicely laid out iPhone screen shot that be very easy to change that with

88
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.840
a screenshot of your app some more information about whatever the product is.

89
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:52.380
Customer quites logos of customers and really nice images pricing set ups and a nice footer with links

90
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.190
to the rest of the pages on your site.

91
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.380
So I think that looks great.

92
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:05.260
The minimal theme has got similar content but a different layouts.

93
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.800
Once again looks great.

94
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.120
We've even got a slider here.

95
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.790
So we can share a number of different chunks of content.

96
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:24.270
And then we've got a bold theme which is a completely different style if you're going for a kind of

97
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:31.280
music Web site or something a little bit cooler.

98
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.150
All right.

99
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.870
So I hope your brain is whizzing with great ways that you could use those themes and I hope you enjoy

100
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:37.350
them.

101
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:42.090
There are a great benefit which you can only get with the complete web developer of course.

102
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.960
So that takes us to the very end of our bootstrap section.

103
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.670
We're now going to look at another way of creating and managing Web sites using a system that actually

104
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.930
powers 25 percent of the web and that is WordPress.
