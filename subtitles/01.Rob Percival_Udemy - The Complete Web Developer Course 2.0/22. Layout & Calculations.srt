00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,440
So moving on from fun animations and transformations in this final video on CSSA 3 we're going to see

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,820
how we can use CSI as three to improve our website layouts.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,200
And the first of these that we're going to look at is a multi-column layout Now this is actually pretty

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,150
easy to set up.

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,770
But before yesterday there was no easy way to get multiple columns in your pages you had to resort to

6
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,770
quite complex DSS or even javascript solutions.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,120
So see how easy it is today in CSSA 3.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,710
So first of get a reasonably chunky amount of text

9
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:52,580
in our div just put a couple of line breaks in between each paragraph.

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,550
And then we'll start it in the usual way.

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:10,120
So multi column and then all we need to use is column count and then however many columns you want.

12
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,060
So I call it three Let's take a look.

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,190
And sadly it hasn't worked.

14
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,800
That's because this is one of the DSS three properties that's not fully supported by crime yet.

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:35,310
So to get it working in crime you need to add a Web Kit column count as well.

16
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,970
And then we have a look then that works really well.

17
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:48,620
And this is just a reminder you should always check the support of these CSSA 3 and Jim L5 methods that

18
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,290
you're using and put in any work around that you'll need to make sure that they work on your user's

19
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,460
browsers.

20
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:59,120
The usual one is Web Kit for anything that's web based.

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,640
So that's chrome Safari and opera.

22
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:09,460
And then if you need anything custom for Firefox that's usually molls short for Mozilla

23
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,910
so to be sure that this is going to work in all browsers you would add those three instructions.

24
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,260
You can customize this further if you like by deciding what the column gap should be.

25
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,270
So there's a default that around 10 pixels.

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,690
But if you want to customize that you just use column gap and then whatever you want it to be.

27
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,820
So maybe 40 pixels.

28
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,850
And sadly I'm going to have to use

29
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,080
these as well.

30
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,910
To make sure it works in all browsers.

31
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,550
Specifically the Web Kit one for crime here.

32
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,370
So that's increased the Kulim gap.

33
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,040
We can even add and style a rule between the column sight line.

34
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:13,740
It's a bit laborious I'm afraid especially because we have to do it three times but we use Cullom rule

35
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,810
style

36
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,190
and then one of those.

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,500
So go for solid

38
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,560
and then we need to do the same thing but with Web Kit

39
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:34,270
and Mole's in front in fact I leave those that we're going to be doing a few of these now.

40
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:40,180
So we then need column rule with.

41
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:53,260
So I'll just have one X and he might be able to anticipate column rule color I'll use grey and then

42
00:03:53,260 --> 00:04:06,080
let's add these two in to maximize our compatibility and then we just prefix the official rule with

43
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,590
those two

44
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,250
that we get it's a bit of a hassle.

45
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:18,200
But we do get a nice rule down the middle so if you're making some kind of newspaper type web site then

46
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,040
this will be a great way to do it.

47
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:28,210
Sometimes you might want an element to span certain columns so say you've got a header

48
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,550
news finance or something like that.

49
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:47,970
So to make that had a span multiple columns we use column span and we can either put all or none or

50
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:56,490
a number if we wanted to span a certain number of columns okay for all and for this one we only need

51
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:04,790
a Web Kit alternative molls is fine for columns span so take a look.

52
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,320
There we go.

53
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,240
So now spanning all the way across even though it doesn't actually need to.

54
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,670
And that's about it.

55
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,060
Notice that this is different to the media queries.

56
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,160
Oh that's unfortunate.

57
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,000
That's better.

58
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,230
So crime is not supporting these columns particularly well here.

59
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:32,580
So these will not be responsive as such so they'll change their width but they won't flow one underneath

60
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:40,980
the other like how bootstrap columns do it if that's the bag that you want then column count.

61
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,130
It is.

62
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,040
All right so that's enough about columns.

63
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,610
I mentioned earlier that we can use CSSA 3 to calculate values for us and doing that is actually pretty

64
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,640
straightforward.

65
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:00,280
You may remember that when we built the code player way back in the queries section we wanted to have

66
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:11,200
a heading so we could even use the new head of tag and then a div underneath that

67
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,210
which was the height of the screen minus the height of the heading.

68
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,530
And we had to use and Jacquier to do that but we could have done it using CSSA three.

69
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,180
So let's see how that would work.

70
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,480
We'll start off by styling the head.

71
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,160
So this is just going to be a

72
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:48,040
100 percent height 50 pixels and will add a background color of gray

73
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,260
that we get so that's where our heading might be.

74
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,950
And while we're here I'll just set the margin to zero.

75
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,100
So that that goes all the way to the edge that we get.

76
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:10,010
Now then if I want my container Dave to be the whole height of the page minus the 50 pixels from the

77
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,040
top I could do that really easily.

78
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,100
So we use container.

79
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:28,120
And again we'll set the width to 100 percent we'll give it a background color of yellow and then we

80
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,840
would set the height to count.

81
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,720
And then 100 percent minus 50 pixels.

82
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,790
And that will do exactly what you might think.

83
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,520
It'll set it to 100 percent of the height of the screen.

84
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,170
Minus 50 pixels.

85
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,320
Now that's the basics of it.

86
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,940
What we do need a couple more options to make it work.

87
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:01,720
First off to get this 100 percent to work we need to set the position to absolute.

88
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:16,860
And we also need to add a Web Kit prefix to the height as well so that everything works in a crime.

89
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,900
Take a look.

90
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,790
There we go.

91
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,560
So now the height of the screen is the height of our page.

92
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,560
But we haven't had to use any javascript to work out what that is.

93
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,420
And you can use any kind of calculation here.

94
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,090
So you can multiply plus subtract divide et cetera.

95
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,110
That definitely makes your life much easier when you find yourself using javascript for styling.

96
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,190
All right so just a couple more things left.

97
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:50,480
First I would like to show you the flex box which is a great way of aligning things while avoiding flights

98
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,230
which can get quite nasty at times.

99
00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:03,560
So the normal way to create a flex books would be something like create a class of flex box container

100
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,400
and then within your flex box container

101
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:17,930
you might have some more device with a class of flex box item or something like that.

102
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,670
I'm just going to put a few items in there.

103
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,310
And then with stylize

104
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,070
most importantly with a display of flex

105
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,870
and also display of rape kit flex.

106
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,040
We don't need a one here.

107
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,440
And then you might want to set a width

108
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,870
and a height

109
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,310
and I'll just set a background color here as well so we can see what's going on.

110
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,600
It's Aqua.

111
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,310
So as it is that doesn't change much compared to just a normal flex box.

112
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,230
We can use the settings we saw earlier to center things horizontally vertically which is a nice extra

113
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:27,790
feature vertical centering in particular can be tricky without a flex box but more importantly we can

114
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:36,510
use Flecha box item and we might want to give that a background color.

115
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,580
Of bisque Why not.

116
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:48,390
And let's give it a with of 100 pixels and a height of 100 pixels as well.

117
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,430
And you can see that these are already floating to the left of each other.

118
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:04,200
Make it a little bit clearer if we give them a margin so say 10 pixels and then if we added more of

119
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,710
those

120
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:15,030
then they actually start to behave like columns and they get thinner and thinner without going on to

121
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,170
the next line.

122
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,640
So compared to floating where we're not necessarily sure whether one element is going to go into the

123
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,070
next line or not because we don't know the screen size.

124
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,590
The Flex box is much more predictable for us.

125
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:38,600
So if we change the width here to 100 percent then it will stretch them out to a maximum size of their

126
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,030
full size but it will compress them if the page is an hour as well.

127
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,500
Now within that we can do some pretty fancy things.

128
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,900
So let's just add some numbers to these

129
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,080
so we can see which ones which.

130
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:09,480
And then you know flex box container if we want to we can set the flex direction to be road reverse

131
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,980
and we need to do the same thing as well with a Web Kit

132
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,870
in front of it and that will essentially lay them out from right to left.

133
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,990
We can also use a flex direction of colon

134
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:38,430
like that and that will lay them out in a column fashion and it will try and squeeze them in vertically

135
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,070
if it can.

136
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:46,260
If I change the container height to say 500 then it will stretch them out a bit more.

137
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,030
And we can use Collamer of us if we want to as well to go upwards.

138
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,210
So the whole idea here is to get a consistent lay out.

139
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,240
Now that might not be what you're after if you're after a responsive web site you might want a different

140
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,700
layout for different screen sizes.

141
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,160
But if you want to be pretty sure that your layout is going to be the same then Fluxbox is a great way

142
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,390
to do it.

143
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:13,260
If you really want your flex box items to wrap we can achieve that as well.

144
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:23,300
Using flex wrap and we've got wrap no wrap and wrap reverse.

145
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,860
I'm going to get a wrap and we'll add a Web Kit flex up as well.

146
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:41,800
And then if I haven't got enough room that will wrap around more like floated items.

147
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,230
All right.

148
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,740
So enough about flex box on onto our final of CSX three.

149
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:51,190
And this is a small but very welcome introduction and this is box sizing.

150
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:58,190
And to remind you about the issue with box sizing I'm going to give item to a cheeky bit of inline styling

151
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:09,730
where I'm going to give it a border of five picks solid grey and that will then as well as giving it

152
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,830
the border it will make it bigger than the rest because you'll remember from the CSSA section that this

153
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:20,680
width doesn't include the width of the border which in my experience is not normally the behavior that

154
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,770
you want but we can fix that with one line of series three.

155
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,690
And that's using Box sizing.

156
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:36,370
And then we can specify Borda box content box or padding box and I'm going to go for border box and

157
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:44,170
that will then include the border in the total size which will mean that item 2 is now the same size

158
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,150
as everything else.

159
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:50,650
Even though it's got a border and that even includes any padding.

160
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:57,490
So if I put padding of 10 pixels in there it doesn't increase the size of the box because the size of

161
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,220
the box is inclusive of both the border and the padding.

162
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,150
And I when I discovered that I breathe a big sigh of relief because it does make things a lot easier.

163
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,160
And you're styling things that have varying borders and paddings.

164
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,420
So that takes us to the end of our journey through HCM L5 and CSSA 3.

165
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,140
I hope you've enjoyed it and I hope you've had a lot of ideas about how you could use some of these

166
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,400
features in your websites.

167
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,490
A reminder again to make sure to check the availability of the various fancy new features that you are

168
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:35,860
using in the user's browsers and when necessary to include the Web Kit and Mole's prefixes to make sure

169
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,500
that you get the desired effect in every browser in which it's available.

170
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,180
It's now time to introduce our final language of the course.

171
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,540
It's one of my favorite programming languages and a great one for new code is to learn and that's Python.
