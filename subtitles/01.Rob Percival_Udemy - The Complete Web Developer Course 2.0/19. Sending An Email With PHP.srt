1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,100
It because HP is a server side language it can do anything.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,530
A server can do and that is quite a bit more than what you can do with say javascript or Jey query.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,150
And one of the really useful features of BHP is allows you to send email.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,800
So this is very useful for something like a contact form because you can code up the form to send you

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,540
an email when someone posts a contact request.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,370
So I'm going to show you the simplest way to do it and then give you a number of reasons why you might

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:35,450
not want to do it completely that way and give you a few more complicated slightly better alternatives.

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:43,960
So the simplest way to send mail with HP is using the mail function and all we have to do is pass the

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,500
e-mail address the subject the body and any other information for the e-mail to that function and the

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
email will get set.

11
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,270
So let's set up all those variables.

12
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,410
You might want to start with email too.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,030
So that could be Rob code dot com

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:13,610
subjects something like I hope this works

15
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,330
then the body of the email

16
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,430
something friendly.

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,370
I think you're great.

18
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:33,380
And then the most complicated bit is we set the headers which is a way of setting the kind of options

19
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,300
for the email.

20
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,390
And the only really important one there is the From.

21
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,380
Header.

22
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:46,420
So we enter it as from and then a colon and then whoever the sender email address we want to be.

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,470
So we might have if I'm sending it to myself.

24
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:56,480
Rob Percival took current UK.

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:56,920
All right.

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,610
So that's all the information that we need.

27
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:06,400
Then we just use mail and then we pass the various variables to it.

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:17,500
So we start with email to then subject then the body and then head is

29
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,750
and that's it.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,170
It's as simple as that.

31
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,380
It's often very useful for us to know whether this has been successful though and this in itself actually

32
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,780
returns either a 1 or 0 depending on whether or not it's been successful.

33
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,500
So we can actually put an if statement around it directly like that.

34
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,680
And then if it's successful this statement will return true because it will be a 1.

35
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,410
And if it's not then it'll be a 0.

36
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:56,210
So the if statement will return false so we could do something like if it was successful the e-mail

37
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,900
was sent

38
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,400
successfully

39
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:13,340
and otherwise we'll say the e-mail could not be sent.

40
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,260
All right.

41
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,730
So let's just try that out and see what we get.

42
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,280
We don't need to resubmit that form we can just reload the page

43
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,320
great.

44
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,580
The e-mail was sent successfully.

45
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:37,300
And if we did something like forgot to include the e-mail to then we'd see the e-mail could not be sent.

46
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,790
Great.

47
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,780
So that's the basic way of sending a mail using THP.

48
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,010
What are the downsides of using this method then.

49
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,990
Well the main one is spam.

50
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:51,740
So because I can choose any e-mail address I like as my from e-mail address you can imagine spammers

51
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,920
are very excited about this.

52
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,250
So they like to send emails from various banks or from Twitter asking you to reset your password or

53
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,440
something like that and they can in theory and with a script to do that very simply because of that

54
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,780
they email clients or providers like Gmail and Yahoo.

55
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,790
Have become very sophisticated about what they will consider spam.

56
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,750
So even though this email was supposedly sent successfully that doesn't mean that it will be received

57
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,860
by the user.

58
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:27,350
So if you really want to get into this you might want to start with something like send HP e-mail without

59
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:37,310
it going to spam and you'll send you'll see a huge amount of advice here.

60
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,880
So if we have a quick look at this one avoiding spam filters.

61
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,640
So that's your basic mail.

62
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,700
So one way of doing it is to put more detail in the headers.

63
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,360
MKP MIME types and all sorts of more information then.

64
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,730
Another thing is to not try and send email from anywhere other than the domain that you're running the

65
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,990
script on.

66
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,000
So this would probably fail because I'm running the script uncomplete web developer course dot com but

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,480
I'm saying that the email is from Roback reposeful Tucker.

68
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,070
OK.

69
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,940
So if I change that to Rob at complete web developer call Stockham that's more likely to get through

70
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,140
because it's being run on the same server that it's claiming to be from.

71
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,960
And there's a few other options there as well that you can do to attempt to get past the spam filters

72
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,240
one completely different option which I actually use quite a lot is to use a service like Mandrell

73
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:44,850
and what that allows you to do is send email through mandrels servers and because Mandrell know what

74
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,560
they're doing.

75
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:51,420
They set up their servers very well so that they are much less likely than your servers to be marked

76
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,370
as spam.

77
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,970
So they charge a very small amount per e-mail but those emails are much more likely to get through.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,850
And if you use this method and you can see from there what's their website is all about.

79
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,850
So it's all about deliverability if you're sending mass e-mail.

80
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,240
I would recommend using something like mandrill or MailChimp.

81
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,500
Having said that if we want to do something with a contact form we're actually relatively safe because

82
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,860
we're only sending e-mail to ourselves.

83
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:25,980
So you could even set up a rule in your email client to say anything that comes from Rob has complete

84
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,260
web develop because dot com.

85
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,720
Don't send it to spam even if you think it is spam.

86
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,620
So this method is perfectly reasonable for a contact form.

87
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,520
All right so now we've learned that a contact form is exactly what we're going to make and this will

88
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:46,750
give us an opportunity to use our Jey query validation as well and our HP server side skills with post

89
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,480
variables and e-mail sending and we'll do that in the next video.
