00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.210
One of the biggest ways that HCM L5 has improved the way that we can create web pages is with forms

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.370
and in this video I will be looking at a few of the cool HD and L5 features that you can use in your

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.570
sites with usually just a single line of code.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:25.660
So lets set ourselves up first off with a new folder so so within our complete web developer of course

5
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.510
folder I'm going to create a new one which I'll call 10.

6
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.520
Jim L5 CSSA 3 and then I'll get back over to my text editor.

7
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:45.360
I've still got my mobile app page and I'll just get rid of everything that we need that then

8
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.650
and we'll treat that as our starting point.

9
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:16.440
And then I'll use File Save As and I'll save it in our new folder each team of 5 CSSA 3 is and then

10
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.180
I'll open that up.

11
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.020
In Crime

12
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.350
and now we're ready to go.

13
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.050
So let's set up a simple form.

14
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.840
We're not going to worry about bootstrap or anything this time not particularly concerned about style

15
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.040
here.

16
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.300
It's more functionality.

17
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.480
So let's start with our humble input element and we'll give it a type of text.

18
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.920
And the first thing I'm going to show you is actually something that we've used throughout the course

19
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.970
but HCM L5 specific and that is the placeholder and you know how that works.

20
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.510
It just means that the browser will show that text and then when you start typing it will disappear.

21
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.950
So that's familiar enough but we wouldn't have it without HVM L5

22
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:27.900
just put that in a paragraph tag and then let's look at our first new feature.

23
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.560
And the first one I'm going to show you is autofocus.

24
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:41.480
So again we've got a simple input with a type of text and all we have to do with autofocus is add the

25
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:50.630
word autofocus to that input and then as soon as we load the page it will take the focus from any other

26
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.370
element.

27
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.020
So if you want your user to particularly start their form with a particular input then that's what autofocus

28
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.170
will do for you.

29
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.920
Note that in sh t m l which is a stricter version of HVM L5 you can't just use empty attributes like

30
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.610
that.

31
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.710
So you would have to specify autofocus is equal to autofocus like that.

32
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.630
And that will still work in HCM L5 but in extreme of itself it's not as fussy.

33
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.720
So you can get away with just putting autofocus.

34
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.630
That's perfectly fine.

35
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.570
So that's pretty cool.

36
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:41.630
Weavings for Phil know we can very easily with him L5 specify that the browser should not autocomplete.

37
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.560
So most browsers remember the content that users have typed into specific fields but in some cases we

38
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.560
might want to switch that off.

39
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.960
And that's really easy to do that shmo 5.

40
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.250
We just use autocomplete as of now here that would make any difference.

41
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.990
But if you wanted to get a user's credit card number or something like that without predicting it then

42
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.290
you could use autocomplete is off.

43
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.300
Note that on is the default.

44
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.160
So we wouldn't have to use that for next co-feature.

45
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.880
I want to show you is required.

46
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.020
So we saw in the J query section how to do validation with Javascript.

47
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:28.760
And later we did it with HP as well but some basic validation is built in to HCM L5.

48
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.230
And one thing we can do is use the attribute for quiet

49
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.260
to force a certain field to be filled in.

50
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.270
So I'll just put a

51
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.710
submit field at the end of

52
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.630
and then let's have a look.

53
00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:03.470
If I try and submit then it will insist that we fill out that field a related task that we've already

54
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.980
seen is one with a type of email

55
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:20.790
and let's put that above the submit.

56
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.470
So if I put some text in there that's not an email address and try and submit or in fact I get that

57
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.470
error first.

58
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.510
But if I then fill in that field and submit it then it gives us a nice error message.

59
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.430
If they don't put a valid email address in.

60
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.030
So let's just label these a little bit.

61
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.320
So we've got a placeholder

62
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.590
autofocus

63
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.430
autocomplete of required

64
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.210
and email.

65
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.110
All right.

66
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:08.560
Getting to more complex stuff we can use a pattern to insist that an input has a certain pattern to

67
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.120
it.

68
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.110
So we would use that

69
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.720
like this.

70
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:29.320
We use the pattern attribute to it for example we wanted to insist that they enter a single digit.

71
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:36.250
Then we could use square brackets and zero to nine.

72
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:45.000
And then as long as I validated all of those if I put a two digit number in there it says please match

73
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.820
the correct format.

74
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.510
And I get it right then it's admits the form.

75
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:57.630
These patterns are standard rejects for regular expressions which again we saw in the chapter.

76
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.050
But if you want to check out some examples

77
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.070
there's a whole Web site out there.

78
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:11.740
Could Tim L5 paten dot com which gives you a bunch of examples.

79
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:20.370
So for example you could specify a user name with two to 20 characters a valid Twitter user name it

80
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.340
cetera et cetera.

81
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.320
You get the idea.

82
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:30.190
So that's a really easy way to validate certain data types without even using any javascript.

83
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:39.700
If you thought that was cool though Wait till you see this with HDMI L5 we can set up autocomplete in

84
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.550
our forms again without using any javascript.

85
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.040
And we do that by setting up a data list

86
00:07:50.280 --> 00:08:01.950
with a set and Id say if I use my classic example I might want to have a data list of names and then

87
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:11.970
within that data list I would set up options just like with drop downs that might have a value of Rob

88
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:18.340
and then a display of up as well.

89
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.350
I might have cast an

90
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.540
Tom A

91
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:36.820
and Ralphy

92
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.440
that we get.

93
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.960
And then I just set up my text input as usual.

94
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:58.980
And I add a list to it with an ID matching the data list

95
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.860
that simple.

96
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:15.130
So now if I start typing that it will predict which ones I'm looking for and even give me a little dropdown

97
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.030
of all the available ones as well.

98
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:25.700
So I think that's a hugely powerful new option and in many ways preferable to a drop down because you

99
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:31.430
can get to what you're wanting to enter much quicker especially if you've got a long list of potential

100
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.550
values.

101
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.080
You can even add a dropdown

102
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.590
within the data list itself

103
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:55.730
and then if your browser doesn't support the new data list feature then it will show a drop down menu

104
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.490
there.

105
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.630
That's a really nice elegant way of degrading.

106
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.270
Should the autocomplete feature not be available.

107
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:16.410
Another useful feature is being able to link an input to a specific form say by default boot aged him

108
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:22.750
or five if you wanted an input to be linked to the form you would have to put it inside that form.

109
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:28.750
But that's not always use if you're generating a table and you want a number of many forms within that

110
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.700
table.

111
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:35.870
And quite often you'll want to put your input outside the form but that's now easy to do with actually

112
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:43.400
him at 5.

113
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:51.630
So you can put your code outside the form and you just link it to a specific form by its ID

114
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.220
simple and then it will appear wherever you want it on the page.

115
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:10.400
But when that form is submitted then this data will be submitted with it on a similar note.

116
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:18.120
Previously when a form was submitted you could only have a single action option on the form itself.

117
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:27.540
So we might have something like pursers form don't pay HP but you might want to go to different locations

118
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:35.130
depending on which submit button has been clicked and you can do that very easily using the form action

119
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.490
on your submit button and you can then just specify

120
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.480
a different u r l for that particular submit button.

121
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:58.210
You can even specify a particular method for each button although I'm not too sure why you'd want to

122
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.550
do that.

123
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.990
You can have get some buttons and post for others.

124
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:12.160
The final new cool thing I want to show you with form is how easy it is to upload multiple files with

125
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.800
each team L5 forms.

126
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:29.290
So the traditional input for files would be an input with type of file.

127
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.830
Simple as that.

128
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.120
And then you would choose your file in the usual way.

129
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:44.730
If you want these are to be able to select multiple files you just add the multiple attribute to your

130
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.800
input and

131
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:59.960
you can then choose that's just pick two files using command or control on Windows and then it's selected

132
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:05.170
two files and then both of those will be updated when you submit the form and that's it.

133
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.460
I hope you'll agree with me that all of those are very useful and save a lot of time in programming

134
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.680
if you want to do any of this sort of validation autocomplete or fancy submitting.

135
00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.980
That's just the beginning of HCM L5 though.

136
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:24.530
And in the next video we'll be looking at how we can use HVM L5 to insert audio and video very easily

137
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.960
into our web pages.
