00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,500
Let's take a quick moment out to see how much you've learned so far in this section because we really

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,330
have covered a huge amount.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,430
We started off looking at what CSSA was and why it was a good idea and how we could use it to style

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,740
our websites.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,770
We then looked at both in line and internal see SS Then we discovered classes and IDs to allow us to

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,220
apply those styles to certain elements.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,490
Then we created some divs to contain our elements and then we moved on to look at specific CSSA properties

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,870
starting with colors and then looking at floating positioning and margins.

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,360
So that really is a huge amount and well done for making it this far and staying with me.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,580
We're now going to look at padding which allows us to do something very similar to margins but inside

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,620
an element and you'll be pleased to know that we've got just a few hours to go until we've covered the

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,680
basics of S and we're going to do our big website project.

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,810
I'll tell you more about that later.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:03,630
So padding is pretty similar to margins but it works on the inside of an object rather than the outside.

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:09,810
So if for example we wanted to have a little bit of a gap between the green text here and the edge of

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:20,960
the blue div we could just get rid of the margin that we could add a padding of say five pixels.

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,810
Let's now have a look.

18
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:23,660
So that's quite nice.

19
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:29,660
It gives us a little bit of spacing in between the edge of the div and the content.

20
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,750
So a quick challenge for you then could you set the padding within this blue box to be different.

21
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:41,940
You can choose whatever values you like but different on the top right bottom and left.

22
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,040
You can probably work out how to do that.

23
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:44,520
Go for it

24
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,660
all right.

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,390
Hope you managed it.

26
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,080
It works in exactly the same way as margins.

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:04,000
So we can use 5 pixels 10 pixels 15 pixels and then 20 pixels.

28
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,260
There we go.

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,680
Might not be that obvious but we've got five pixels up here ten down here 15 at the bottom and then

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,390
20 on the left.

31
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,470
It's worth noting that if we've specified a whit as we have here the padding is on top of that with.

32
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,250
So we've got our 400 pixels from say they're there.

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,110
And then the padding.

34
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:33,130
So the 10 pixels on the right and the 20 pixels on the left will be on top of that 400 pixels.

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,880
So quick question what is the width of this box in pixels.

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,490
The total weight

37
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,850
it it's 400 plus the 10 on the right plus the 20 on the left.

38
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,760
So 430 pixels in total and that's definitely worth remembering.

39
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,870
You can get yourself in a lot of trouble if you think that this is 400 pixels and then forget that it's

40
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,180
actually 430.

41
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,480
All right.

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,160
So that's more or less all you need to know about putting it just one more thing.

43
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:04,870
I'm going to show.

44
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,080
You may have noticed that there's quite a bit of white space that we haven't programmed into our page

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,460
here.

46
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:18,000
That's that by default and browsers have default margins and padding built in to their elements and

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,510
that can make things a little bit tricky if you're trying to get a really pixel perfect design.

48
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,980
So if you do want to do that and get rid of all of those defaults then I would do something like.

49
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,710
First of all starting off with the body.

50
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:42,690
So we're now styling the actual body of the page itself and set both the margin and the padding to zero.

51
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,020
And let's have a look and see what effect that has.

52
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,200
So you can now see it stretches right to the edge of the page.

53
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,620
You'll notice as well that we've got this gap between our lives here and a gap up there.

54
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:05,630
If we wanted to get rid of that then we would actually set the padding and the margin for the paragraph

55
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,510
tags to zero.

56
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,250
So that's what's causing that gap there.

57
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,960
So if we set both of those in then everything kind of condenses up.

58
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:23,750
So that might not necessarily be what you want but we've achieved the effect of getting everything really

59
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,040
close to everything else.

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,690
As a quick aside if you're getting quite excited about this and think you might get really into web

61
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:39,500
design with CSSA then working with something called a CSSA reset makes these things a lot easier because

62
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,960
these default margins that we saw over here can actually vary from browser to browser.

63
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,860
So using a CSSA reset in your pages makes those the same.

64
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,230
So you can be more sure that your website is going to look exactly the same in every browser.

65
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,750
So feel free to investigate that a little bit more.

66
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,680
And definitely if you're having issues that a Web site that you're making is different in different

67
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,850
browsers putting a CSSA reset in there is probably a good idea.

68
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,450
All right.

69
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,270
So that's as far as we're going to go with margins in the next video.

70
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:18,570
We'll look at how to add a nice bit of styling to the edges of your device or other elements using borders.

71
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,450
See you then.
