00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:00.910
All right.

2
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.670
So let's start applying some style to our own web pages first.

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.070
I'm going to give you a quick challenge and that is to create a new folder inside your complete web

4
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:20.110
developer course folder called to see access and then create a new HGL file and display it both in your

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.160
text editor and in your browser just like this.

6
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.210
Everett Gehlot

7
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.730
All right I hope you manage that.

8
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:39.760
I'm going to do it by getting the complete web developer course open and then I'm going to right click

9
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:51.670
or control click and collect new folder I'm going to call it to dash C Ss and then I'm going to go back

10
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.600
to my text editor.

11
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:06.390
I'm going to create a new file just like that and then I'm going to save as and I'm going to save it

12
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.350
inside complete web developer course to see SS

13
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:21.960
and I'm going to call it web page wave style dot HVM eval it's still in DML file even though we're going

14
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.360
to have some cascading style sheets inside it.

15
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.920
There we go.

16
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.490
And then finally I'm going to go back into my CSSA folder here and just open up web page with style

17
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.290
in the Google Chrome and there it is.

18
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.320
So I'm going to say goodbye to my HELLO WORLD.

19
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.680
I'm going to do a quick test just to make sure that everything is linked up correctly so I've put some

20
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.440
text in there and I'm just going to refresh that.

21
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.440
There we go.

22
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.100
Lovely.

23
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.760
So I hope you manage to do that.

24
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.070
If you didn't it's just a bit of file manipulation really.

25
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.410
Now I'm going to put in the very basics to get us an HMO page.

26
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.640
As we've seen before so we'll start with an HP M-L tag.

27
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:23.080
Then inside that will have heads and then we'll have our body section and I'll just put in a title tag

28
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.520
as well.

29
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.490
So I like to have a title

30
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.530
we'll call it web page with style and then if we just refresh that you can see the content disappear

31
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.190
but where page with style has appeared there.

32
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.480
All right now there are actually three different ways of adding CSSA to your web pages.

33
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.850
I'm going to show you the first one in this video and this is in line at CSSA.

34
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.190
So very quick challenge can you create a pair of paragraph tags and put a sentence whatever sentence

35
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.460
you like between them.

36
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.930
Giffard

37
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.160
All right.

38
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.060
I guess that's a pretty straightforward paragraph tags are just a p inside the language brackets them

39
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:18.370
and all have the classic phrase The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

40
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.820
All right.

41
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.990
So now we've got a paragraph.

42
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.480
It's not style to.

43
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.600
So if we want to bring some style into this if we were going to use inline C Ss we would do the following.

44
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:38.370
Inside the paragraph tag then we would add a style attribute and then just as we usually have without

45
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:46.100
attributes we have an equals and then some quotes and then we can put any CSSA we like into this style

46
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.970
attribute.

47
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.480
So for example if I wanted to change the color of the text I might say color so that it doesn't work

48
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.900
if you spell color correctly.

49
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.620
But there we go color without a.

50
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.680
And then blue.

51
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.700
So you if you've got a colon in between then and that's how CSSA works you have the thing that you want

52
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.990
to change and then a colon and then the value of that thing.

53
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.000
So in this case color colon be fairly straightforward.

54
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.490
Save refresh and we have some blue text.

55
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.930
Nice and easy.

56
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.790
If we wanted to have text which was twice as big then we would add a semi-colon and we use a semi-colon

57
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:36.730
to separate different stylings so we might want font size and we might want to set the font size to

58
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.570
200 percent and that will then set the font size of this text to twice as big as it was before.

59
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.960
Let's have a look.

60
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.120
There we go.

61
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.950
I've just realized over the lazy dog there let's make it over.

62
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.450
Brilliant.

63
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.460
So that's really all there is to inline CSSA in terms of how it works.

64
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.230
I can give you a very quick challenge here.

65
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.790
Can you create an H-1 header tag with the content CSSA is cool.

66
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.090
And then make it green and half the size it used to be.

67
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.700
So each one tag with the content CSSA is cool but then green and half the size it would otherwise have

68
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:25.430
been go for.

69
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.190
All right.

70
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.190
How did you manage that.

71
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.820
H-1 tag of course just an H-1 in brackets and then says this is cool.

72
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.360
It certainly is.

73
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:44.960
So without any styling at all it would look like that with some style.

74
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:56.550
We set the color to be green and then if we wanted half the size we would use font size 50 percent.

75
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.870
All right.

76
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.680
Let's take a look.

77
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.480
Fantastic.

78
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.960
Now one thing that might be slightly surprising then is that it's got a lot smaller than you might expect.

79
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.640
That's because this percentage is actually relative to the default paragraph's size.

80
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:17.450
So if we make this 100 percent it will make it the same size as a paragraph.

81
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:24.240
So if we actually wanted it the same size as the usual one the default there is 250 percent.

82
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.070
So an H1 by default is two and a half times bigger than a paragraph.

83
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.920
But don't worry too much about that.

84
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.640
Looking at the specific CSL styles later on in this section.

85
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.910
For now though we're done with inline CSSA and in the next video we'll see how to add CSSA in a different

86
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.310
and better way.
