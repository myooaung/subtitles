1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,690
So it's all well and good being able to create and manage our database through ph my admin.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,580
But to be able to do anything useful with it we need to be able to connect to it with a ph piece script.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,650
And that's what we can do in this video.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:25,390
So I'm going to go back over to fire FGP and create a new folder or directory and I'm going to call

5
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,920
this 7 my su l.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,670
There we go.

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:41,370
And then within that folder I'm going to create a new file which will be indexed top HP and that will

8
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,270
be what we'll be working with for most of this section.

9
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:53,310
So I'm going to use the command 0 0 controller in windows to open that up in brackets and then I should

10
00:00:53,310 --> 00:01:02,540
be able to access that page at a complete web develop because dot com slash content slash 7 Ifan my

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,600
ask.

12
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,750
Well that looks promising we've got a blank page so far.

13
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:16,220
Let's just add a quick bit of content here and refresh just to make sure we're all linked up.

14
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,330
We are indeed wonderful.

15
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,440
So the main challenge for this video is to connect using HP to our database.

16
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,040
And that's actually pretty straightforward.

17
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,280
We create some new ph code in the same way that we're used to.

18
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:41,900
And then there's just a single command to connect to a database and that is my Eskew L I underscore

19
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:49,990
connect the there is short for improved and some of you may have worked with databases before or searched

20
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,930
on line and seen my Eskew underscore connect like that.

21
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,310
That's a very popular way to connect to a database.

22
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,200
But I definitely wouldn't recommend it.

23
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,530
It's officially deprecated now which means it's not supported and it's certainly not as secure as my

24
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,240
as you well I underscore connect if you want to learn more about the differences and why you should

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,160
use this version rather than just my ask you will connect.

26
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,490
Then have a quick google.

27
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,390
My is to l vs. my SU ally.

28
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,910
Something like that will give you all the reasons in detail why you should use this version.

29
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,850
But if you've never seen this before then just consider this the best way to connect to a miniscule

30
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,590
database.

31
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,200
It's worth noting that there is third way to connect to a database called PTO.

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,680
And again if you're interested in these things feel free to have a google and check out pedia.

33
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,160
But I'm going to go for my askaris lie because it's secure it's supported and it's much easier to use

34
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,930
I think than PDA.

35
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,370
All right so we have to pass three variables to the.

36
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,230
My Ask your ally.

37
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,470
Connect function and the first one is the server name of our database.

38
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:58,670
Now because I'm running this script on complete web developer because dot com and I set up my database

39
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,780
on complete web developer course dot com as well.

40
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:10,250
I can use what's called localhost and this is a general keyword that you can use to refer to the server

41
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,230
that is running your scripts.

42
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,090
You'll also be able to use localhost if you're working with an Apache server on your own machine.

43
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,790
If for some reason though your database is on a different server to the script that you are trying to

44
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:30,620
connect to you can still connect to it but you need to use the server IP address which is this one here.

45
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,090
So in my case it's 79 to 1 7 0 4 4 1 to 5.

46
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:41,210
So I would just replace that with the IP address.

47
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,950
However if you are running it on the same server I would definitely recommend using localhost because

48
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,200
the IP address can in some cases change.

49
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,640
So I would only use the IP address if you absolutely have to.

50
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,900
All right so that's the server that we want to connect the next we need to give the database user name.

51
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,170
So that's the whole of this thing here.

52
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,870
So C-L 29 hyphen uses hyphen B's at H.

53
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,420
You should put whatever you've got here when you created your database.

54
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,190
And finally of course we need the password

55
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,100
which is in my case that I may well have changed that password.

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,910
By the time you're watching this video.

57
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,840
So don't try and connect to this database.

58
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,360
It might not work.

59
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,320
You should definitely connect to your.

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,080
All right.

61
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,630
So that's it.

62
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,710
What happens when we run that script absolutely nothing.

63
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,520
That's because it's connected to the database.

64
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,370
But we haven't all told it to do anything with that connection.

65
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:53,150
So it's obviously very useful to know in our script whether or not that connection was successful and

66
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,840
if it's not then we should give an error message of some sort to the user.

67
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:07,340
So there's a built in my ask well I connect error function which will be empty.

68
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,770
If there's no error but will contain an error if there is one.

69
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,880
So let's echo that for the moment and let's generate an error by misspelling localhost.

70
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,930
I'm putting an E on the end.

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,710
Let's see what we get.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,690
OK.

73
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,870
So you can see we've got an error there.

74
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:33,530
Get address info failed so it's trying to get the address info for the server and it's failing because

75
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,650
it doesn't exist.

76
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,260
If I correct that then the message goes away.

77
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,340
So that's pretty much it.

78
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,950
Just a very quick challenge for you then.

79
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,890
Can you change this code so that instead of just echoing the error we have an if statement that says

80
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,280
if the connection was successful tell the user that it was successful.

81
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,050
If it wasn't.

82
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,880
Tell the user that it wasn't Durford

83
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:03,980
all rights.

84
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,330
How did you manage that.

85
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,530
It's pretty straightforward.

86
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:13,130
We just need an if statement and then we're going to put that in itself in the if statement because

87
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,780
remember I said it was empty.

88
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,210
If the connection was successful

89
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,710
if there is an error then we should echo.

90
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:30,280
There was an error connecting to the database.

91
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,970
You should never echo the error itself on a public Web site because that may give way details as to

92
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:43,740
what you're trying to connect to which is never good.

93
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,090
If there is no error that means it's been successful.

94
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,550
So again we never actually display this to the user.

95
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,660
But for now we'll just say database connection.

96
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,530
Successful

97
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,320
All right.

98
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,780
Let's take a look.

99
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,340
Wonderful.

100
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:08,730
We're now connected to the database and ready to create some interactive data storing Web sites in order

101
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,660
to do that of course.

102
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,840
We've got to be able to take data from the database and be able to edit and update that data.

103
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,220
And that's what we'll do in the next few videos.
