00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.380
So now we're going to move on from lists and look at how we can include images into our web page.

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.230
Of course before we can include an image we'll need to get one that we want to include in our page.

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.920
Or you can use any image you've got on your computer.

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.740
I'm going to show you how to do it with an image that we find online so I'm just going to get to Wikipedia

5
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.680
and search for my favorite cartoon character Homer Simpson.

6
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.060
And there he is.

7
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.250
So I'm going to get this image and put it into our web page.

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.820
So I'm going to do that by control clicking or right clicking on the image and then save image as and

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.330
that will save the image onto my computer.

10
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.720
I'm going to save it in the same folder as my web page or HD mail file.

11
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.380
And I'm just going to change it to Homer to keep it simple.

12
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.000
Much easier to access than.

13
00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.900
There we go.

14
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.130
So that saved the homer dot P and G image and g is a file type for an image.

15
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.690
If you have a different image you might have jpeg or Jif instead.

16
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.310
It doesn't matter.

17
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.810
They all work the same way but it is important that you know what the whole file name for your image

18
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.950
is.

19
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.140
All right.

20
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.600
Now we can go back to our Web page and let's see how we add an image.

21
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.610
It's actually pretty straightforward.

22
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.220
So get rid of out code for the ordered list and then to add an image.

23
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.540
We use the i m g tag and this is a self-closing tag.

24
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.650
So again we just close it.

25
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.560
That is not going to be a closing of the image tag.

26
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.670
But we do need to specify an attribute for this tag.

27
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.050
And that is the SLC or source.

28
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.370
So this tells us what tells the browser where the image is and what it's called.

29
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.810
So we're going to call it Homer P and G.

30
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.820
You can see that the text that is or I'm using here actually predicts that for us because it's looking

31
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.380
for file names in the same directory as the web page which is really handy.

32
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:18.060
But if yours doesn't work just type the file name and then save that and then refresh and there we go.

33
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.820
So now we've got an image right there in our web page and we can of course add whatever other content

34
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.580
we want to this so we might want to put a little label underneath just to say.

35
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.240
This is Homer Simpson and that will then align itself underneath the image.

36
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.950
So there's lots of ways that you can customize images.

37
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.690
I'm just going to show you a few here.

38
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.920
So first off what we might want to do is change the size of the image and we might do that using with

39
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.280
equals.

40
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.840
And then let's say we want to set the width to 100 pixels.

41
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.910
Let's have a look and see what effect that has.

42
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.490
So you can see 100 pixels is quite a bit smaller than it is by default but it nicely scales the image

43
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.800
as well.

44
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.560
If you didn't want the image to be scaled You might want for it to be a square image.

45
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.380
For some reason.

46
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.930
So you could then specify the height as being 100 as well.

47
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.180
And then that would squish the image up.

48
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.170
You can also change the alignment of the image.

49
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:31.670
So if you wanted to align left for example you could just add a line he calls left and then it will

50
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.340
align to the left of any text that comes after it.

51
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:44.710
Similarly you can align it to the right and then the image will be aligned to the right of the page.

52
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.680
The last thing I'd like to show you is that you can actually link to an image directly on the Internet.

53
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:58.960
So let's go back to Wikipedia and let's say instead of Homer We wanted a picture of Marge Simpson.

54
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.970
And this time instead of saving the image as we're going to copy the image address which copies the

55
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.540
you Arel or web address for the image which I've just pasted in there it starts HGT p.s. and then has

56
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:22.540
a lot of extra stuff and ends up with Marge Simpson dot P and G so I can actually paste that directly

57
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:35.220
into my source so SLAC attribute for the image tag and then that will load it directly into the page.

58
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.900
There we go.

59
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.330
So that saves us having to download it and allows us to link to it directly on the Wikimedia server

60
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.880
it's a word of warning.

61
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.000
Obviously if you don't have control over the image they might change the location of it or block you

62
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.440
from downloading it for some reason.

63
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.130
Wouldn't be a good idea to do this on a production site.

64
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.290
And also this is known as hotlinking.

65
00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.670
When you link to an image on someone else's site and quite often they don't like that especially if

66
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.560
your site is very busy and they start to get lots of server traffic because you're taking the image

67
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.230
from their site.

68
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.370
So Jim really any images on your site I'd recommend downloading and putting on your servers and accessing

69
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.530
from there rather than doing this hotlinking.

70
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.830
So I'll just change that to march.

71
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.220
And I think I preferred the alignment being on the left.

72
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.840
So we'll leave that as it is there.

73
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.280
Nice.

74
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.820
So we're now going to move on from images and see how we can start to build in a little bit of interaction

75
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.490
with our web pages by using forms.
