1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,880
Well congratulations once again for making it to the end of the first section you've gone from not knowing

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,360
how a web site is put together a tool to being able to put together pages containing forms I-frame tables

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,190
images HD Mellon's these and a lot more.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,050
So well-done.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,030
We're going to put that into practice now by essentially creating a web page that contains everything

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,100
that we've done so far.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,750
So I've got an example page that you can copy if you like but really I want you to go crazy and create

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,240
anything you like could be a home page about your family your favorite sport whatever it might be.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,480
I'm sure it's going to be a lot more fun.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,280
You choose your topic if you want a little bit of inspiration.

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,710
I'll show you what I'm going to be making and I've got this over here and you can actually get the code

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,450
for yourself.

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,910
Incomplete web developer calls don't come slash to slash HD M-L challenge dot HVM L.

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,050
So just stretching that out you can see I've got a nice image here of the globe.

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:01:00,600
I've got an on ordered list a link and a table down order list and then a very tiny bit of a form there

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,990
just to include it and also a YouTube video aligned to the right over there.

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,680
So that uses pretty much everything we've covered so far.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,260
So what I'm going to do is challenge you to create something like this you can bet exactly this page

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,770
if you like or can come up with your own design and content.

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,510
Best of luck.

21
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,100
What you have done it would be great if you uploaded it to your empty space and then shared a link so

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,920
that I can take a look and congratulate you personally.

23
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,500
Don't forget to use all the good DML habits that you've learned so far.

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,210
So that's nice.

25
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,280
Indenting spacing out your code etc..

26
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,180
I hope you enjoy this challenge.

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,760
Go for it.

28
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:41,650
All right.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,880
I hope you enjoy that.

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,610
I'm going to close that down and start building our web page from scratch.

31
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,350
So this is how I would have done it.

32
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,900
Of course as with any coding challenge there are many ways to build a web page or solve a problem.

33
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,750
You did it differently.

34
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,070
That's absolutely fine.

35
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:07,060
I'm going to start by going to example dot com and just using example dot com and just viewing the source

36
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,600
as we did so control clicking or right clicking view page source and then I'm just going to copy the

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:24,240
whole of that source code and use that as my starting point and that just make sure that I get the doctype

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,060
and everything else in there without having to type it myself.

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,150
I'm pretty sure that it's going to be right so don't be afraid to do that when you're building sites.

40
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,590
Obviously don't copy wholesale other sites but be to use them as starting points so that you're not

41
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,530
typing out the same code every time.

42
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,230
I'm just going to get everything nicely indented

43
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,230
and there we go.

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,590
So now we've got a basic bit of content.

45
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,070
Mine of course is about the world we live in are Earth.

46
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:01,170
So I'll call it the good old hello world.

47
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,020
So I will do a quick refresh.

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,320
Yep so got no content there at all.

49
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,430
But we've got a title of hello world.

50
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,290
All right.

51
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:19,350
So I'm going to start with a nice big header so we'll use each one and we'll have a nice big hello world

52
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:26,310
at the top and you'll notice that as I go through the process of building the page or refresh and just

53
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,090
check that it looks OK a lot more than you might think.

54
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,310
So even though we've just got a very basic bit of code there it's always good to see that your new line

55
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,260
of code hasn't broken anything or done anything unexpected.

56
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:51,760
OK so now I'm going to pop in a subtitle so HD a few facts about the world we live in.

57
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,770
Full stop.

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,170
I think that we get very nice.

59
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,440
Now I want a nice picture of the earth so I'm going to go to

60
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,980
Wikipedia.

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,470
And search for Earth.

62
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,400
And there we go.

63
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,650
Lovely big picture then.

64
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
And as we've done before.

65
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:24,910
I'm going to save the image as I'm gonna save it in my HVM folder.

66
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,870
I'll just call it

67
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,170
there again.

68
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,600
So this is a jpeg rather than a P and G.

69
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,710
JP G is the extension.

70
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,540
I'll remember that but it should get auto predicted by

71
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:51,680
my text editor anyway OK so let's pop in our image.

72
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:03,430
Nice and simple image SIRC for source and Earthwatch J peg gets predicted that pretty slick.

73
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,170
There we go a little bit larger I think.

74
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:15,700
So let's make it a little bit smaller so we can adjust that with the width as we saw in the image section

75
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,980
and I'll try a width of 100.

76
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,490
See how that looks a little bit small.

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,970
Try maybe 400.

78
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,420
OK that's about right of course.

79
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:35,530
Not necessarily looking for great style here but it's not hugely big and but I can still see the detail

80
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,980
of our planet there.

81
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:43,930
Right now I want to get a bit of information about the earth so I'm going to Google Earth facts.

82
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,190
There we go all that first one space fax dot com.

83
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,980
That looks great

84
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,060
lovely.

85
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,270
All right so I'm just going to use this paragraph of content there.

86
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:04,140
Now this but of course you wouldn't be for any live site that you are working with.

87
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,940
But that's fine for a bit of practice but definitely if you're making a site that you're going to use

88
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,160
publicly then make your own content.

89
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,940
OK let's have a look.

90
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,000
Very nice.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,760
So now I want to have something with an unordered list.

92
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:29,940
So this bit of information looks good so I'm going to copy that and if I keep the moon in there as well

93
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,730
and they'll give me the opportunity to add a link so I'll copy that over.

94
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:42,810
Now this is a new section so I'm going to separate it from everything else with a horizontal rule.

95
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:52,010
I get and now I'll paste in my new data and actually just to keep things simple.

96
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:03,740
I only have three of them and I want an unordered list so that's a UL

97
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,370
and each of these is going to be a list item

98
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:25,960
that's pope that's the beginning and end of days and indent them so that the code looks really nice.

99
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,400
Great.

100
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,600
Let's just check.

101
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,210
There we go.

102
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,800
I'm liking that.

103
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,380
Now let's add in our link for the moon.

104
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,400
Now it goes to that you are well at the bottom of the screen that space fax dot com slash the moon.

105
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:52,000
So I'm going to copy the link address so I Contro clicked or right click and copy that and then to add

106
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,730
an anchor or link.

107
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,710
I use an ID tag with an 8 Tref of what I just copied.

108
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:12,490
And then we'll have the text the moon and then will close the e-TAG.

109
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:22,000
I will see if that works looks good have a click Billiam links to the page about me.

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,840
Fabulous.

111
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,330
Now I'd like to have a bit of practice putting in an ordered list.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,370
So what I would say is

113
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,550
I'll copy the code for an unordered list.

114
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,800
And just change it to an ordered list.

115
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:54,840
And to separate that out from the previous list I'll add another horizontal rule.

116
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,880
Now obviously we need some new bits of information there.

117
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,200
So let's have a look facts about the earth.

118
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,420
Fantastic.

119
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:10,270
So let's make these to make them numerical data.

120
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:21,780
We'll have an H3 a little heading saying top three facts about the earth.

121
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,680
There we go.

122
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,500
And then I'm just going to copy these in

123
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,520
the Earth's rotation is apparently gradually slowing.

124
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:40,470
Interesting stuff the earth was once believed to be the center of the universe have that as a fact number

125
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,680
two and the earth has a powerful magnetic field.

126
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
So get rid of the link there because we don't need it anymore.

127
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:01,040
Brilliant let's have a look fabulous looks great.

128
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:08,240
I think now we need a little header above the previous list to kind of match that out.

129
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,270
So let's put an H-3 and we'll just call that about the

130
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,100
OK great storming three.

131
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,300
So now I'd like to add a table.

132
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:34,300
So let's separate out the section again and I'd like to have an opportunity to you GM out entity so

133
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,340
let's compare the radius and temperature of two other planets.

134
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:46,210
Just for fun so I will add in our table and we'll have our table header

135
00:10:50,650 --> 00:11:02,590
and within our table head we'll have a table row and within our table row we'll have a T-H which is

136
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:11,590
going to be the name of the planet and then another T.H. for the radius of the planet and another T-H

137
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,220
for the average temperature.

138
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,630
OK I just have a quick look.

139
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,760
Yep that's looking good.

140
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,860
I think I might just add in a line break

141
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,430
to make average temperature go over two lines.

142
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,990
All right.

143
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:46,280
So after the table head comes to the table buddy

144
00:11:49,590 --> 00:12:01,630
and within the table body we have table rows and within days we have table data table cells.

145
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,080
So we'll start with Mars.

146
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,740
So we need to get the radius of Mars.

147
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,640
I think we can get this from our space facts Web site

148
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,260
if we just scroll down here we go because Mars factory is.

149
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:30,840
Hopefully that will tell us the radius and temperature of Mars.

150
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,910
It's giving us the diameter that little bit of math for you the radius is half the diameter.

151
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,560
So I'm going to divide that by to you say 3400

152
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,000
and we'll rounded up three.

153
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,320
That's three thousand four hundred three kilometers

154
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,950
and then average temperature.

155
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,800
OK shall we find the average of minus 87 minus five.

156
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,970
We'll add them together and you get minus 92 all of that and you get minus 46.

157
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,660
So that's not exactly the average temperature halfway between the maximum and the minimum.

158
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,840
But really for our purposes.

159
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,950
So the tricky bit is with them what a degree sign.

160
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:26,500
So let's search for him out and the degree symbol that should tell us what we want.

161
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,090
Are we going to make sense and Dagh.

162
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,870
That's another quick hint for you.

163
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:37,950
If you get the Google search term accurate enough then quite often you won't need to leave Google at

164
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:43,230
all for your result and you can just take it from the Google extract from that page.

165
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,520
Let's put in and dig and then see

166
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,040
rights.

167
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,430
Let's take a look.

168
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,770
MAS 3400 three kilometers and minus 46 degrees C fabulous.

169
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,920
I think we'll just add one more to our table.

170
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,740
I'll do that just by copying and pasting.

171
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,750
So let's do the same for Venus.

172
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,310
Scroll down to get our facts and Venus facts.

173
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,700
So the diameter is 12 1 0 4.

174
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:29,780
So we want the radius so we'll have it say six thousand and fifty two.

175
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,010
That's what the come in the right place.

176
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,060
And then it's only giving us a single temperature there.

177
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:43,010
So we'll take that as the average for 6 2 degrees C

178
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,360
fabulous.

179
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,080
Let's take a look William.

180
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,400
There we go.

181
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,640
Finally then we want to integrate a form into our table.

182
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:04,450
So let's have another horizontal rule to separate them out and then we'll add in a very very quick form

183
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,730
which in fact is only going to have a button in it.

184
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,800
So we'll have to know more.

185
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:21,280
Question mark and then a button remember his input with a type of submit

186
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,900
and we'll put that inside paragraph tags as well.

187
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,410
OK let's have a look.

188
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,780
So that's great.

189
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,280
Submit though doesn't really make sense.

190
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:47,090
So let's change the wording using value equals and then click here.

191
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,160
Let's have a look.

192
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:57,350
Now this is all well and good but if we actually click there then nothing happens because the page just

193
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,520
refreshes.

194
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,070
So what I'll do is I'll give you a little bit of a reward for making it all the way to the end of this

195
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:11,750
tutorial and I'll teach you one more thing to get your form to submit to a particular page and you do

196
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,200
that using the action attribute just like that.

197
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:23,450
And then inside action you put the you r l of the page that you want the form to submit to.

198
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:32,710
So let's say we want to go back to the earth page facts and we just copy that Control-C all commands

199
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:39,170
C and control V all command V to paste it in them.

200
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,960
And now when we click on the button it will submit the form.

201
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:49,250
Not that there's any particularly useful information in the form but we will submit it to that u r l

202
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:58,610
which just has the effect of redirecting that to the space fax page.

203
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,210
Brilliant.

204
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,020
So almost there.

205
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:07,720
The only thing that I want to add to this is an I frame it with a YouTube u r l of Earth rotating.

206
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,680
So let's do a quick search for you cheap Earth rotating.

207
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,350
That's what one looks good.

208
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,370
We don't need the sound I don't think but wonderful.

209
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,790
That looks great.

210
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:30,950
So let's click on share embedded and then just copy that

211
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:44,580
and initially we'll put this underneath and there it is wonderful.

212
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,900
But in the example that I showed you we had the video on the right at the top.

213
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,610
So let's add that in.

214
00:17:52,790 --> 00:18:00,350
We can actually add that in the same way that we aligned the image earlier by doing a line equals and

215
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,860
then right.

216
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:08,560
And that will align the I-frame to the right of the page but it will still be at the bottom.

217
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:17,770
So if I want to align it to the right at the top I need to just cut it so command X or control X and

218
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:27,490
then put its right at the top here even above the H-1 and then let's have a look.

219
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:33,490
If we then drag it out it's now aligned to the right fabulous.

220
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:39,260
So it's not the best looking web page ever but it contains a lot of the HDMI elements that we've seen.

221
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,210
And hopefully it's at least a good step up of what you could have done at the beginning of this section.

222
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,810
So once again congratulations on getting this far.

223
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,570
These do show me your projects and I look forward to helping you make your web sites look a lot prettier

224
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,910
using see SS in the next section.
