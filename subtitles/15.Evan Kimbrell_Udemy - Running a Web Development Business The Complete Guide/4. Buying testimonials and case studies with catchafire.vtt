00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.140
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:14.250
So in this lecture we're going to cover some opportunities to get portfolio items done quickly.

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.770
Now this is an option to go over.

4
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.710
That's essentially you do it for free.

5
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.660
Now a lot of people know that at very beginning your portfolio is of the utmost concern and it's even

6
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.740
so important that you might want to do a couple of small projects for free but they don't know where

7
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.290
to start.

8
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.580
So in this lecture we're going to cover some opportunities and places to look for projects that can

9
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.950
be taken over projects that can be made and then projects that can be ultimately included in your portfolio

10
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.390
and how to go about doing that.

11
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.340
So let's go to screencast.

12
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.330
Later on we're going to talk about tagging and one of the strategies of finding people who need free

13
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.190
work in exchange for tagging and that's a marketing strategy.

14
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.050
But as a strategy for building your portfolio.

15
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.770
A lot of times you kind of have this chicken and egg problem right.

16
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.970
It's very hard to build your portfolio with your portfolio.

17
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.240
Why would someone trust you if you have nothing in your portfolio to show them.

18
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.000
So at first it seems it might be out of your reach to even charge money.

19
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.990
So one thing you can do and this has worked very successfully for us and other development firms in

20
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:32.480
the past is that you can offer your services for free for pre-set amount of time in exchange for using

21
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.730
whatever you build or whatever project you're a part of as a portfolio item.

22
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.250
Now if you listened to the previous lectures we talked about how anything you work on can go in your

23
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.200
portfolio.

24
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.700
So.

25
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.920
So this is a great example of a site that you can do this on.

26
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.630
There are other ones out there.

27
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.360
This is probably the largest one.

28
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.420
And you'll notice a lot of web development firms that are aspiring or freelance professionals that are

29
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.160
aspiring will use this Web site to get essentially free portfolio items and also to give back.

30
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.460
That's something that you're interested in doing.

31
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.690
OK.

32
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.370
So the way that this Web site works is this in exchange nonprofits and I believe social enterprises

33
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.170
which is just another way of saying a for profit that has a social mission.

34
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.720
They post small projects that they can't afford to have done or it's inconvenient for them to pay for

35
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.880
and they look for professionals who are willing to donate their time.

36
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.040
So organizations join they list out what they're doing then they'll list things they need and professionals

37
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.730
can go through and pick some things and send them a message.

38
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.150
And that's pretty it's pretty simple it's just a basic marketplace for people who need stuff done and

39
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.470
professionals willing to donate their time.

40
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.640
And so the way that you would find a project is very very simple.

41
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.820
You only have to pick out two of these things right here.

42
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.040
Let's just start with what are you good at.

43
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.960
So what are you good at.

44
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.820
You're going to be good at web development.

45
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.890
If you're someone who's previously a freelancer in design and you're coming out this as a way to grow

46
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.610
your design freelance business then you can pick that.

47
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.100
And if that's what you're more comfortable with you want to use Design go for it.

48
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.200
In this case we're just going to talk about web development.

49
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.760
What do you care about now.

50
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.730
This is really up to you if there's something that you're specifically more passionate about.

51
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.490
You can definitely pick something.

52
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.260
It really does it for our purposes it doesn't necessarily matter because we're just looking for somewhere

53
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.680
to point our free effort towards So it makes sense to send it towards a nonprofit that's trying to benefit

54
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.090
society.

55
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.540
But past that it's really up to your personal preference.

56
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.770
You could be really callous and say Oh I'm only going to go for the one that has the most visibility

57
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.610
I'm going to pick something that looks the best in my portfolio then.

58
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.330
Yeah and honestly in that case then maybe you might want to look at this more from a business say if

59
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.930
you are someone who focuses on startups and educational apps startups and if you want to go for education

60
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.690
if you're something that's worried more about you know if you have a specific niche maybe you ought

61
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.540
to find something in that specific niche.

62
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.950
If you don't go for visibility maybe you do things around government or international affairs or something

63
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.900
that has high visibility blogs or high visibility things so this whole thing is completely up to you.

64
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.480
I suggest going for something you're passionate about.

65
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.170
And then once you're actually into the list you can decide if it's whether or not you know a project

66
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.430
is too small for your purposes.

67
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.690
That's really up to you.

68
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.810
OK so right off the bat we have 52 projects and this is just kind of immediately what's available if

69
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.650
you keep searching every other week you'll notice that more and more add on.

70
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.080
This is something that we do occasionally only have lead time not because we need a portfolio because

71
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.780
our portfolios fall but it is something that it's nice to point your extra effort towards because a

72
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.670
lot of these people just need really small stuff done.

73
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.730
And it's not particularly difficult.

74
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.960
So some of these are get bigger and some of them are quite a bit smaller.

75
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.980
So right at the top it says what they need.

76
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:18.380
And then below that it says how many hours you just need to kind of calculate in your head what you

77
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.960
think it's worth it whether or not you have the bandwidth to give up a big project or whether or not

78
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.250
you're really looking for something to put five 10 hours in and get out.

79
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.410
Like for instance this is something that would be you know they say 35 to 48 hour 45 hours.

80
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.760
But if it's just WordPress website construction then it might not be the case you spend that much time.

81
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.190
You also might be a little concerned about the turnaround time.

82
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.320
And if that's the case maybe you want to look at the timeline over here so maybe you want something

83
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.980
that's shorter.

84
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.920
So there's a lot of different things here that you can put yourself into.

85
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.290
You know it's really this is something this strategy that's completely up to you if you decide to take

86
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:10.240
over someone's web site redesign or to develop some widget or app that helps someone nonprofit do something

87
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.910
that it's kind of entirely up to you to make it look good make it function well so that you can put

88
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.440
it in your portfolio.

89
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.380
Keep in mind what you're going for in your portfolio.

90
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.110
Keep in mind basic tenants we talked about before about portfolio consistency and then just try to keep

91
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.650
in mind how many hours you want to put into this.

92
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:36.640
And when you need your portfolio item done it is something that you can dedicate you know three months

93
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.890
to then go for it if it's something that you're more interested in getting something smaller done quicker

94
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.060
then look for something that's only a couple weeks.

95
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.430
You can also do this just manually.

96
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.980
You can always look for nonprofits in your area.

97
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.970
Nonprofits you're specifically passionate about and contact them.

98
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.860
This just saves you a lot of time because it's already people who are looking for something.

99
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.250
There's a lot of things out here that seem pretty nifty and pretty cool.

100
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:09.550
You can really fill your entire portfolio with nonprofit things that are all over the world in various

101
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.090
different sectors.

102
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.460
Obviously in that case be careful because you don't want your entire portfolio to look like you only

103
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.230
work with nonprofits unless obviously that's your strategy but it's not really something you can go

104
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.770
wrong with.

105
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.990
So be conscientious about how much time you have to give.

106
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.550
Be aware of what exactly you need out of it and it's definitely something that can help you and help

107
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.430
someone out there as well.

108
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:38.240
So see you guys in the next lecture.
