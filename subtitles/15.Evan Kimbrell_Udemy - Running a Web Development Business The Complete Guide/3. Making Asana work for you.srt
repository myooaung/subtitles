1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:06,130
All right.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:12,280
So let's talk about integrating this into your project.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,440
The easiest way of doing that kind of like I explained previously in the last lectures to quite literally

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,470
get the email address of your contractor or your freelancer or whatever and immediately invite them

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,020
in and then add them to your project.

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,980
If you have a private project what you can do is you can physically add them in.

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,580
It's like an ad project members this is public but it make private work the same exact way to do that

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:44,200
and then add them in the way that I would suggest setting this up is that you divide out your kind of

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,650
work area into three different sections.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:56,140
And the first section what I usually do is create this as a template before or even on board a contractor.

11
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,980
So I'll take the first section and I'll call it Section 1 or build tasks or just tasks or whatever it

12
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,530
is that you're actually doing.

13
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,730
And I'll make that the first section.

14
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:12,100
OK and then right over here I give a description because a lot of people are not immediately aware of

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,140
how a sauna works.

16
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,050
Some people use it.

17
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,420
Some people haven't.

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,230
So people are used to base camp or something else.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:28,510
So what I do is I put up here and I say here we're going to list out all of our all of our tasks.

20
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:29,490
Okay.

21
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:36,790
And then what you are essentially going to do is ask them to list all of the tasks that are going to

22
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,050
be involved in your project.

23
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,190
Now I can't obviously make a template that's going to fit every single project so you're just going

24
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:47,260
to think about your project if it's a mobile application you then going to have to ask them to list

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,030
out every single section as they see it.

26
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,240
Usually these are going to be user centric.

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,970
Now what I mean by user centric they're not going to say okay finished the database or have this one

28
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:04,630
section upload code to this other section and make that a task to make the tasks user centric so what

29
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:11,590
a user sees this screen will be done this button will be done this function this feature will be done

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,530
because as they update it something visually should be happening to someone who's using your application

31
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,920
or using your product.

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,660
That's the easiest way of doing this especially for you the project manager if you're non-technical

33
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,030
even if you are technical you're not going to be so integrated into this project you're going to know

34
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,600
exactly what's going on in the back end and so you're not going to really be able to tell what's up

35
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:42,460
and what's down if they try to use esoteric kind of the confusing jargon as explaining back and functions

36
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,080
in the second section.

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,670
What I typically like to do is set off a section where I put additional tasks and I'll usually call

38
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,010
this one just additional tasks

39
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:06,040
even task and features OK now what do I mean by this section right here.

40
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,650
What I mean is I'm going to remove this due dates or sorry.

41
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:17,250
So what I mean by this now an additional task and feature what I typically do is I list out any additional

42
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,210
tasks that were not included on the project or the task list.

43
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,750
You previously agreed on.

44
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,040
Now if you guys got someone off of either answer oDesk or wherever then you agree to some kind of a

45
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,440
work specification.

46
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,070
So slightly fall the previous section where we made work specifications.

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,860
They're going to follow that.

48
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,170
This is the section where you add anything that's an additional to that as they're building it out you

49
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,180
might see additional things you want or additional tasks that you didn't anticipate needing that's where

50
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:50,370
you're going to list these out here and again because of Ossana the way they do threads this is a fantastic

51
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:58,050
way of doing it so I could say you know maybe I wanted to add a feature maybe I said like I wanted to

52
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:07,840
add a notification feature so I could say notification feature to x section.

53
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,450
OK obviously it doesn't really make sense because we don't know a project we're talking about but what

54
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,150
we can do over here then is I can give a drill down description of what exactly I mean is it like e-mail

55
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,460
notification a push notification a text notification.

56
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:25,770
Who is getting message who clicks it or does it display etc. etc. and then right here you can have a

57
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:31,290
discussion going down the thread with the person you're working with until they get to the point where

58
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,800
they understand what exactly it is and they can give you an estimate.

59
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,200
Now previously we talked about whether or not you work on project price or whether or not you work on

60
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,730
hourly price if it's hourly will give you an estimate in terms of hours if it's project price I'll give

61
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:50,460
you an estimate based off of just that that one section or the bundle sections together.

62
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:57,030
If you use our technique which is that we use a hybrid where we do day rates half day rates and things

63
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,050
like that then they'll give you an estimate like that.

64
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,430
And you've clearly set the tone previous to that so they'll know exactly what type of estimate you like

65
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,810
to get.

66
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,850
And they'll put it down here and you can ask them estimate it.

67
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,970
I also like to put that up in the scription estimate out this section.

68
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,580
You know here's the description please give me an estimate or ask any questions.

69
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,990
Now the third section I like to create is just bugs on us.

70
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,190
It's it's literally just an ongoing section or where I list out issues as they happen.

71
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,520
Now when you first start you're not going to have anything built so you're not going to have any bugs.

72
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:37,920
But as they start building out tasks and we start clicking through them you will start noticing them

73
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,870
as you test.

74
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,220
You know something doesn't load correctly something looks wrong.

75
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,950
This button is broken.

76
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,240
Something is awry something.

77
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,960
Maybe they didn't follow the specifications correctly and maybe didn't understand the project perfectly.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,760
This is where I started listing off sections down here.

79
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,150
Now this is helpful because this task this section will start to be very large and as it starts to whittle

80
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,620
down this section will grow.

81
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,960
Also what I think are best practices for using this section using a bug section is to only list out

82
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,490
general bugs general meaning something some bigger picture issue is happening.

83
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,710
This whole section just looks off.

84
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,270
This section is going to the wrong page et cetera et cetera.

85
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:30,330
Now if you want to leave bug feedback for a specific task what you actually do is say we had a task

86
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:44,050
and say This task was to generate email based off user information and pre populate it pre-populated.

87
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,200
OK so that was our task and say they built that and they checked it and say you're looking at the completed

88
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,810
list.

89
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,640
What you could do is you could go in here and add what's called a subtask.

90
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,500
So you could do is at a subtask and this is a useful way of adding bugs.

91
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,500
If they're only helpful if you can assume that this bug is the only part of this.

92
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:14,520
OK so if that e-mail was pocketing incorrectly I could say you know generated email has just put on

93
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,560
like jargony code at the beginning of e-mail.

94
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,200
And then if you saw another one we could say that generated.

95
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:31,920
You know whatever the actual bug is doesn't work on you know Apple Mail or something like that whatever

96
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,440
it is you can individually list them out have a conversation down here and as they fix them they can

97
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,880
click this through.

98
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,670
Now that's one way of doing it and that's helpful if you have a specific problem with a specific function

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,280
and that bug is only related to this.

100
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,230
Now if you had a bug that you don't really know it's related to.

101
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,910
Or it could involve multiple task.

102
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:59,700
It's actually a problem putting it on here because of the freelancer might miss it or they potentially

103
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,850
just if they wanted to find it they wouldn't be able to find it.

104
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,830
Granted we do have a search bar up here so you can search for things but maybe they didn't know exactly

105
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,090
what you called it.

106
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,710
So if that's the case I like to put them down here so like bigger bugs if I want to say like there's

107
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:21,420
a large section that doesn't work say you know the photo capture tool in my mobile application.

108
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,990
It's crashing in different sections like.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,890
Or I'd say like it's slow.

110
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,790
Chances are up here we wouldn't just have creative a photo capture we would have separate sections so

111
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,330
integrating the camera.

112
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,690
And then you'd have a section that says for instance like installing the actual layout of where the

113
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,010
camera buttons are or the flash buttons are using filters.

114
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,390
You do have a section as a separate one so it's a more generalized bug we can put it down here.

115
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,860
It's up to you how you do it.

116
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,910
Personally I like to use these I like to just list my Bugg's list in a massive list because once that

117
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:03,120
person is done with their individual task or the entire task list then they just immediately move here

118
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,050
and just start knocking them out.

119
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,300
And as you start playing with it you can literally just have this open as a tab as you're playing with

120
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,630
your project or whatever it is and you just start listing out bugs.

121
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,050
We do have a section on bug hunting.

122
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:22,140
That's something that's very helpful to go back and read watch or watch if you skipped it to just to

123
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:29,580
talk about where are the most common areas to get bugs where are areas people don't think to look for

124
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,300
to find bugs.

125
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,510
What tools you use to find them.

126
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,480
You don't need to be a web specialist or a mobile application specialist to find bugs.

127
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,680
Literally anybody with a mouse and fingers can find bugs.

128
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,250
And again and with any project there are always going to be bugs.

129
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,100
Don't obviously judge your contractor or your freelancer based off of that.

130
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,280
That is just something that is a reality of web projects.

131
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,540
OK.

132
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:00,620
So I think that is kind of the ideal way of creating your first project.

133
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:08,220
I do suggest if you do have design assets or wire frames remember you made wire frames to go in and

134
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,700
load them into like say the section over here because it'll show up in the attachments that you can

135
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,260
move them to individual tasks as you have the freelancer populate them talked about that previously

136
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,980
in the last lecture.

137
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,080
That's also very important.

138
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:26,640
Right you don't want to dictate who builds out the task list you want the other person to do it and

139
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,520
then you can kind of have the editorial review look at it and say no that doesn't make sense.

140
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,290
No that takes too long.

141
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,630
Or no I want this to be in a different hierarchy.

142
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:42,510
I want you to work on this section first because I need to use that sooner or show this off sooner or

143
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,260
whatever.

144
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,630
But if you build it out like this and guys feel free to just to copy this this is the most effective

145
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,510
template We've used to just build out as much as you can make sure you have all your design assets or

146
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,620
wireframe in it.

147
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,500
Make sure you have descriptions make sure you've listed out anything that you can think of that you

148
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,530
wanted to add if you have questions right off the bat.

149
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,010
You can create a little section and add a question and have them edit it.

150
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,710
Make sure that you get them to pick the due dates.

151
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,390
Don't be sticklers on that.

152
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:19,140
That can actually kind of kill a project but make sure that they are using some form of loose due dates.

153
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,310
Now you know if you are running a big project or a project that has a large budget and you're paying

154
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:32,130
a premium for people then it might be OK for you to set strict deadlines for each individual task but

155
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,060
just in our experience it's easier to be loose.

156
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:42,120
You know it also if you if you're using an agile system you can build these out instead of saying build

157
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:48,070
asks you can say Sprint one sprint to Sprint three sprint four take suggestions from the people that

158
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,970
you work with honestly.

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,080
We've had people say day one day to day three day four things like that that breaks this system just

160
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,310
a little bit but it doesn't really matter.

161
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,010
Whatever they're comfortable with what they understand the entire point of this is to be able to track

162
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:09,610
your progress and create transparency also to be able to kind of put a laser focus on what exactly you're

163
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,950
talking about what exactly they're talking about and what exactly you have issues with which is one

164
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:20,950
of the biggest problems that we have in general with project management for web and mobile projects.

165
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:29,710
One other thing worth noting is that as you do this it's worthwhile that you keep logs of what's happening

166
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,980
in Assata builds logs for you that you can export.

167
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,200
That's very helpful if you are hiring someone off of Elance or up work or freelancer.

168
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:44,680
They have their own contract system so it's helpful to occasionally take those logs and upload them

169
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,540
there.

170
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,650
If you do choose to use those companies to control your payment methods which a lot of people are doing

171
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:58,540
smaller projects will do it's a good idea to keep logs of your progress of your questions of what the

172
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,690
application looks like through its individual stages.

173
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,220
Always if you have the option of having more documentation versus less documentation always pick more

174
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,640
documentation that's going to help you if there is ever a conflict in the future.

175
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:17,890
And if you are using those payment systems freelance or other platforms they get to be the final arbiter

176
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:24,540
of who gets the money who who made an error who screwed up or who made the mistake.

177
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,720
So make sure that you're not in a situation where there's no documentation of their work on their system.

178
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:34,210
There's only documentation over here make sure that you do crossover occasionally.

179
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:34,480
OK.

180
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,270
So that pretty much covers a sauna.

181
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,420
Guys it's free.

182
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,230
Sign up for it.

183
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,510
It's great if you have any suggestions for tools that you want me to cover posts in the group discussion.

184
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,650
This is the one that I like because it covers pretty much everything and it's free and it's fast and

185
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,680
it's multi-platform so see you as an ex lecturer.
