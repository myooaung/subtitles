1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,940
OK so here was an estimate that we had created a while back project that never got off the ground but

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,040
nonetheless we used our usual technique for estimating this out.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,600
OK.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,680
And as you can see on here what we basically did is we took every single subtask and then put them under

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:23,790
individual tasks and the tasks are either some large feature or when you see the bolded section that

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,800
actually connotates a section.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,400
Now remember if I was doing an altogether estimate you actually would just see the total at the bottom.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,070
This is all I would deliver to the client right there.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,430
Now if I was doing a section by section all I would deliver would be the messaging.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,870
I'd say like messaging and I'd say how many hours does a server set up and packaging how many hours

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,230
it does.

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,930
I would say group messaging and then I'd say how many hours are associated with that.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,530
Now with piece by piece now you can see that we actually go and we estimate out individual tasks and

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,670
how long we think they're going to take.

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,730
Now I obviously think this is the by far the superior option.

16
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,570
There have been numerous occasions where we have the one client's because we used a piece by piece estimation

17
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,400
and the people that we were competing with used a section by section or an all together estimate.

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,170
And the reason why we ended up winning those was because clients actually love piece by piece estimates

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,110
and it's something that not enough people do.

20
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,600
The reason why they love it is because even if they're not technical they love to be able to see individually

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,470
how long every single edition takes.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,000
That gives them transparency.

23
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,310
That immediately establishes trust with you and that sets up a situation where they know exactly what

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,130
it's going to take to put every single section.

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,680
And they're also confident that you know what every single section is going to take.

26
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,940
And in general they're not expecting you to give them that much transparency.

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,740
In general our industry is very opaque.

28
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,850
People generally will try to hide a lot of the information because they think that protects them.

29
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,870
What we try to do is we try to show off as much as we possibly can.

30
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,570
We found that that actually establishes trust early that helps us close sales.

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,660
It also helps our clients and a lot of different ways what they can do is they can look at a piece by

32
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,500
piece estimation and they can pick the things they want to add and pick the things they actually want

33
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,520
to drop.

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,350
We can also do things very Now if you listen to the other lecture we talked about a strategy of constant

35
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,260
estimation.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,530
We can add in things always at the bottom we can add in additional features very easily down here just

37
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:30,090
put in a new section say potential features optional task optional optional features and then just add

38
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,150
it like normal.

39
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,600
Create a different subtotal so they know what is the proposal total and the other one is the proposal

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,870
plus the optional.

41
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,990
So it ends up selling a lot easier.

42
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,670
It makes it easier to explain to clients what's unnecessary and what's necessary.

43
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,230
That allows the client to be more successful in general because they can save their funds from sections

44
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,860
that are abnormally large and put them towards things that are actually smaller.

45
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,560
Now you think that would be a negative for you.

46
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,370
But again if you listen to the other lectures that we talk about rich clients versus successful clients

47
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,210
we talked about tying your project to your customer success.

48
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,630
That's actually quite important right.

49
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,660
You don't want your client to run out of money especially if it's a decent sized project.

50
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,560
Now if you want to create one of these it's really really simple honestly and in general this is one

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,860
of our secret techniques that have really really helped us grow.

52
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,220
People really like seeing this level of detail.

53
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,690
They will instantly get you noticed if you're competing with a group of other people.

54
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,730
It really helps to educate the client and helps the client really kind of connect with the application

55
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,510
they're making.

56
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,100
And it really shows off that we know what they're talking about even if we don't necessarily know exactly

57
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,210
what they're talking about.

58
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,950
We've just given them a lot of detail and really something to work with a lot of times our clients come

59
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,640
to us and we give them a really complex piece by piece estimation.

60
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,520
They can use that to convince other people that A we know what we're doing and B hey look this is an

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:56,010
actual concrete explanation of what we're trying to build which a lot of times clients will come to

62
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,120
you with just 19.

63
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,370
Just a business plan or just something scribbled on a napkin.

64
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,230
Now they see this.

65
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,180
Now it's real.

66
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,360
Now they become a lot more serious about it.

67
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,310
Now if you guys want to create a piece by piece estimation it's really quite simple.

68
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,950
I can include at the very end of the course a template if you want to but honestly it's not really that

69
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,150
complicated at all.

70
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,600
Typically what we do is we just divide everything into columns on the left side will name tasks and

71
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,850
a task can be something large.

72
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,510
Easiest way to think about this is actually just call it a feature.

73
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,140
These are the features with the exception of server setup and packaging.

74
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,570
The easiest way to think of this is task our task slash features typically like a feature like Sign-Up

75
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,070
or a feature like messaging.

76
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,610
This is be listed under attack because it is a task but also things like server setup and packaging

77
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,360
even things like time you take to submit something to say like an Apple store or an Android store.

78
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,330
Those are things that you can call tath So in the first column we just list out all the major tasks.

79
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,370
Then enter subtask.

80
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,320
We try to give as much detail into the process of what that actually entails as we can.

81
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,510
We don't every single time know every task that it's going to take that's why it's important to obviously

82
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,340
hedge when you send these proposals to people say that you know this might be a draft or this might

83
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,020
not be a finalized version and then come back to them with the finalizers and once you get enough information.

84
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,780
But for the most part it's not really something to fret over.

85
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,790
So in the second section try to break down every single large task or large feature and do as many separate

86
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,440
task as you can think of.

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,020
And then the third column you can choose between what we did here we gave an explanation.

88
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,510
Even with more detail where we said this is how many hours it will take on your back and back and meeting

89
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,610
the server that handles the information to the application that we're building.

90
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,320
And then over here we individually describe to build this is for a mobile application we described what

91
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,450
it would take to build on every single platform but you can imagine if we're just talking about say

92
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,120
a site you'd have the back end and the front end.

93
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,270
You could divide it that way if you wanted to really up to you.

94
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,090
Typically we only give three columns.

95
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,680
But in this case the person wanted a lot more.

96
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,780
So we actually added another column.

97
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,400
You can also put notes on the side.

98
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,620
These are things that are really helpful because you can put comments you can say that you have doubts

99
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,610
about something in the subtask you could say we need more information about this.

100
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,610
You could give some clarity for why a number is larger than you would think or smaller than you think

101
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,710
you can explain why one of your numbers might actually be zero until you get more information than what

102
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:27,220
we typically do is we'll put another section where the client can give comments and we can just go back

103
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,630
and forth that way.

104
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,020
And that's a very easy low tech way of collaborating with the client.

105
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,580
So guys really really simple.

106
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,760
I suggest you do it.

107
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,930
Clients love it.

108
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,880
It's really a competitive edge.

109
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,290
It's something that gives you transparency and it's something that establishes trust early which is

110
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,180
something that is crucial at the beginning of your business especially when you're working with new

111
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,950
clients.

112
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,430
You can impress them by doing this.

113
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,990
It doesn't really take that much time.

114
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,170
It's something that I think is definitely worth it.

115
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,430
You spend more time on it but you close more deals.

116
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,960
It's a way you can set yourself apart.

117
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,350
So if you're doing a subcontracting strategy I suggest talking to your subcontractors about setting

118
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,700
up a system like this.

119
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,200
Typically they're pretty amenable to that if you are developing it yourself then this is something that

120
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,280
I think you should consider developing as a skill.

121
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,390
I don't think it takes that long to get used to.

122
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:22,060
You just need to get used to getting your bets giving rough estimates and then doing more research to

123
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,310
give more specific estimates.

124
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,500
Once you know that the client is pretty much on board and there's a very high likelihood that you're

125
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,380
going to land the project.

126
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,800
All right guys see in the next lecture.
