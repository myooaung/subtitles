00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,090
Hey guys.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,150
Welcome back to the course so in this lecture I'm going to give you probably one of the best business

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,030
tips I have ever gotten with regards to running a development firm.

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:23,580
Now I actually heard this previously in a marketing class because I heard that it applied to marketing

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,650
companies in ways that you market yourself but it's not necessarily something that I think applies to

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,830
every single business but for development firms specifically it is kind of the law of the land it's

7
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:41,290
kind of the golden rule that I always follow and I always consult people to follow.

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,110
Now one of the biggest things that will make a difference between whether or not you're successful and

9
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,540
whether or not you fail at this business is whether or not you understand what your value proposition

10
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,020
is.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,780
Now value proposition if you're not familiar with the term basically just means that your product offering

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,200
or your service offering what exactly can you deliver to the customer.

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:09,750
Now a value proposition for let's say a taxi cab that would be that they can get you to your location

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,140
cheaper and faster than if you walked.

15
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,190
Or if you owned your own car.

16
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,090
So value propositions are just like the simplest way of summing up what exactly you are offering in

17
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,230
your service offering.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,660
Again it's kind of what do you offer with your combination of skills and products.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,990
So now with regards to a development firm you have to realize that there's a lot of other development

20
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,250
firms out there a lot of them don't realize what they're good at and what they're bad at.

21
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,290
You're always getting a leg up on them for that.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,230
The best way of thinking about your development firm and your product offering and your value proposition

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,220
is that there are three main things you can be.

24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,980
One is good.

25
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,970
Another is cheap and another is fast.

26
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,930
Those are three things that could describe your business or your service offering.

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,930
Now here is the key thing.

28
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,680
You can only pick two of those.

29
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,490
It is impossible to be all three.

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,650
Now let me explain how that's possible.

31
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:18,840
So imagine that you deliver your websites or your mobile applications quickly so you qualify as fast

32
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,790
if you're delivering it quickly and it's obviously is a relative statement to what the person would

33
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:30,330
otherwise expect with another firm then you're probably cutting corners somewhere either you're cutting

34
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,630
corners on quality and spending less hours on it.

35
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,620
So therefore it's harder to qualify as good or you're working with people who are extraordinarily efficient

36
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,240
and you have to pay them more.

37
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,310
So you don't really qualify as cheap now as you're trying to qualify for good.

38
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:53,220
Well then chances are it's going to be very hard for you to deliver it quickly because good typically

39
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,030
means that you spend a lot more time on it.

40
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,500
Also good kind of implies that you can be paying your people more.

41
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,570
Working with people who have more experience and thus are going to have a higher rate.

42
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:09,330
So very hard to be cheap and then the last will and if you're cheap that means you're probably cutting

43
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,050
costs somewhere right.

44
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:18,060
So probably you're saving money by having a loose timeline delivering it later than usual and using

45
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,930
techniques like using off hours or lean time to kind of save money that way or you're cutting costs

46
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,100
by focusing on lowering the quality of your actual output.

47
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,240
So now don't worry you don't have to just be one.

48
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,150
You can be two out of three.

49
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,600
But three out of the three that's just impossible.

50
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,660
So to give you an idea here at Sprint.

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,270
We are good and cheap.

52
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,380
We are not fast.

53
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,230
That is our biggest problem.

54
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,020
We take much longer than what most people would expect.

55
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,400
We actually only work with people who do not have strict timelines.

56
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,300
And this is something that just took us a long time to figure out.

57
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,740
We tried to kind of put together our team figure out what we're good at figuring out what our clients

58
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,610
were happy with.

59
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,930
And that's kind of what we figured out is that fast is just something that we cannot compete on.

60
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,330
And so we focus on being good and we focus on being cheap.

61
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,550
That's how we get our clients.

62
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,950
That's how we keep them.

63
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,120
But it also lets us know that there's just certain projects we cannot keep and certain promises we cannot

64
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,810
keep.

65
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,920
So this framework applies to a lot of different things but web development mobile development.

66
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,450
It is seriously the best way you can possibly look at it.

67
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,050
Don't expect to be all three.

68
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,880
You're not going to deliver the best possible product every single time.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,720
But if you focus on optimizing two of these three you can actually end up with a very appealing and

70
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,500
competitive product offering and then you can focus on ways to de-emphasize the one feature that you're

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,760
not good at.

72
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,950
So you know if you if you can't focus on being good then you should focus your message on how cheap

73
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,020
affordable and quick you are and you'd start looking for clients that have you know things that are

74
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,740
not necessarily quality centric need you to update something very quickly and they want to do it affordably

75
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,860
you can make a very big business around people who need maintenance work.

76
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,240
You can also make a really good business around people who are on a budget.

77
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,540
People who don't need the creme de la creme the absolute top 1 percent of Web sites.

78
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,380
They only need something that's going to function and somebody doesn't look terrible.

79
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,350
So that's a great opportunity there.

80
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,390
Say you want to skip the whole fast thing and this is what we do.

81
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,610
So we only look for people who have aspirational projects or companies that have projects that are not

82
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,690
necessarily dependent on other sections of their company.

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,270
So if you don't care about your time line we can take our time focused on keeping the costs down and

84
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,610
keeping the quality high.

85
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:48,530
BI just kind of going crazy on the timeline and then cheap obviously if if you can't focus on being

86
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:54,260
cheap because you have to hire the best people then focus on people who want top quality work and they

87
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,650
want it done quickly but budget is not a concern for them.

88
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,940
That's an entirely different segment of people that you can go after.

89
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,120
So keep these three in mind.

90
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,860
You can only pick two.

91
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:10,520
So when you're formulating how you're going to build your strategy for this development firm keep this

92
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:22,070
in mind use that going forward or seeing the next lecture.
