00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.260
Hey guys will come back to the course so in this lecture we're going to dive a little bit deeper into

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.620
portfolios and we're going to talk about what are the common mistakes that everybody seems to make when

3
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.810
they're picking their portfolio and putting it together.

4
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.660
Now you might just want to take every single thing you've ever done and stick it into a portfolio.

5
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.980
And that's kind of an amateur mistake.

6
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.040
Don't worry that I just called you an amateur.

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.090
I did that too.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.150
I took everything I could possibly think of stuffed it into a PTF.

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.480
And that was my portfolio.

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.940
Now why do I say this because portfolios are kind of tricky psychologically when you look at someone's

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.070
portfolio or someone looks at yours.

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.690
They're automatically going to judge you by your worst item.

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.210
That is kind of the Assumption across the board that people make your worst portfolio item is probably

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.840
representative of what they're going to get from you.

15
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.630
Now that night that's not necessarily true but that's what they think.

16
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.340
Right.

17
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.410
And this kind of comes back to what we talked about the previous electrify five portfolio items and

18
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.100
one of them is terrible.

19
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.850
Why would I work with someone that 1 out of five times produces something that's very low quality.

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.740
I mean imagine that like if you had five portfolio items and four were phenomenal and one was terrible

21
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.920
what would you think you might be ecstatic that the four were great but also realistically you're probably

22
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.630
worried like what happened with that fifth one.

23
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.560
So when you pile everything in together you have no control over the consistency of the quality.

24
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.450
And what ends up happening is they're always just going to take the worst item.

25
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.820
So it's better to take a smaller portfolio that's curated and presented in a positive way.

26
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.960
So keep in mind pick the better ones keep a smaller group that you show off.

27
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.630
And like we talked about before.

28
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.720
Consistency is key.

29
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.570
Make sure that whatever you show is consistent in quality.

30
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.190
Now another thing that you need to keep in mind about with portfolios if you're doing a development

31
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.300
project people when they look at development portfolios automatically biased towards good graphic design

32
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.200
and that's completely irrational from our perspective.

33
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.140
Poor graphic design or poor user experience will no matter how hard and technologically advanced the

34
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.060
app is it will make it look bad.

35
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.010
Unfortunately people always think that good design means good app..

36
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.710
Even some of the most experienced people out there when selecting providers make this basic mistake

37
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.330
because remember at the end of the day the person making the purchasing decision.

38
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.060
They're also a consumer and they're probably going to pick something that looks good to the consumer

39
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.220
because they want a good product.

40
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.900
So if you have the option pick ones that look good over ones that show off your technical prowess.

41
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.580
Now if a client specifically asked for something that looks complicated or specific to their use case

42
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.490
then you can provide it to them.

43
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.880
You can also preemptively do this when you know someone's looking at your portfolio you can send that

44
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.350
to them.

45
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.440
You can see design polish but it's very hard to see technical prowess.

46
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.590
So at first focus on simpler but better looking items.

47
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.970
And as you get more and more portfolio items to choose from you can expand from simpler to more complex

48
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.910
as long as you keep the consistency of quality the same.

49
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.690
So the main takeaways keep your portfolio small.

50
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.340
Be aware of what the worst item in your group is.

51
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.290
And if you have to choose pick ones that are simpler but look better technologically advanced sites

52
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.310
they don't.

53
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.760
It's not immediately obvious that they are so technologically advanced.

54
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.080
OK guys keep that in mind when you're building your portfolio or planning out your portfolio.

55
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.210
Incorporate this into the clients you take on as well.

56
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.680
You know a client can have a great portfolio item be more flexible with them.

57
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.270
OK.

58
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.030
See the next lecture.
