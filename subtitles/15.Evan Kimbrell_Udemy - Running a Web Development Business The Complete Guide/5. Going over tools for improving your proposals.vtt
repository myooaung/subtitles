00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.500
You guys are going back to the course.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.270
So in this lecture just to talk a little bit about some of the tools that are out there that are available

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.100
to you for making good proposals.

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.650
So Paul the last lecture we covered some of the components that are in the complex proposals.

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.440
It's all pretty standardized.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.550
And typically when you have something that's very standardized that lots of people use There's usually

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.160
going to be a lot of tools out there.

8
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.950
Now if you listen to the other lecture we talked about how we do it at Sprint.

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.620
We don't actually use complex proposals so we don't actually ever put these together.

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.290
But if you wanted to make a complex proposal and you planned on using that frequently and maybe that's

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.780
something that you're using as a competitive advantage it is worth knowing that there are some tools

12
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.750
out there and how to acquaint yourself with them.

13
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.080
Now there's a bunch of them out there and I've worked with a lot of them and I only selected two of

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.510
the ones that I think probably fit most people's needs.

15
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.540
These are the ones that have the correct feature set have all the things you want and don't like to

16
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.240
add in a bunch of stuff that you don't really need.

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.140
Also the price point on these are much much better.

18
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.890
These are all going to be SAS tools.

19
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.490
So you're usually going to pay $20 a month $50 a month or $100 a month.

20
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.940
Some of these things get really really expensive because they know that their customers are typically

21
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.920
agencies and they have large budgets.

22
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.510
These are better for freelancers and they also have free models that you can use.

23
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.080
So there are two that I want to highlight.

24
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.890
The first one is proposed.

25
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.080
And this is by far the best one that I've used for creating complex proposals.

26
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.100
Now the reason why I like using them is one they're cheap but two they also have embedded templates.

27
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.820
Now a lot of you out there are going to want to start making proposals right out of the gate and you're

28
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.100
not going to have custom designed for your proposals will have templates that are rather good.

29
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.620
Good enough that they can get you kind of a quick start when you start and then later down the road

30
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.430
you can start working on more custom versions of your proposals.

31
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.210
These platforms also integrate your own custom design so when you do get your own design you can bring

32
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.580
it in and work with it.

33
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.070
OK.

34
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.480
So the way they propose the fireworks is pretty easy.

35
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.320
You put together a proposal just by logging in and creating a new proposal.

36
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.180
You can use a free trial if you want to.

37
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.520
You can also just use their free version which limits how many proposals you can have that are active.

38
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.880
What that means is that if you create a proposal you send it out and your client accepts it.

39
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.700
That proposal is no longer active say not going to charge or you're not going to have your account upgraded

40
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.880
because you closed a proposal and only cares about the things that are currently active meaning that

41
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.570
they're finished.

42
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.460
They're out there and people are actually using it.

43
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.840
So the way that you create proposals and here is you just start by creating your own proposal.

44
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.870
They give you they give you information templates which is really really helpful.

45
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.730
So what you can do is you can pick whatever information template you want and basically what that means

46
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.920
is that they're going to pre-load all of the text based off of one of the templates and you can pick

47
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.950
between really anything they have all sorts of different types really any freelancer has a template

48
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:11.670
that you can use.

49
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.330
I'm just here use this as an example so you can fill out your basic settings.

50
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.400
In this case will use example company but usually you can add your own client.

51
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.520
Then when you add your own client then you can keep track of all of the proposals you send to a client.

52
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.640
You can see the completion rates for a client and review some pretty cool analytics.

53
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.890
We'll cover that in second.

54
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.640
So just say example a company you can choose to put a proposal do or not.

55
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.870
The reason why you choose a proposal being do is that their system allows you to remind your clients

56
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.600
that it's due in a couple days.

57
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.620
Now typically development firms will put due dates on their proposals.

58
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.660
It's not really like a hard deadline.

59
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.890
The reason why we do that is because if I make an estimate for your application I typically only want

60
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.990
that to be valid for say a week or two weeks because after two weeks it might be the case that I need

61
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.750
to reassess what exactly is going to go into it.

62
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.020
Things could change.

63
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.160
API could change technologies could change the scope of the project could change so we try to generally

64
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.370
limit the validity of the estimate.

65
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.580
It's only useful in the case when you make an estimate.

66
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:27.480
You don't put a due date on it but someone a year or two years later comes back to you and says hey

67
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.200
I want to work on this project you gave me this price.

68
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.050
That's why we put due date so we can just use a theoretical date.

69
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.370
All right.

70
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.610
And then we can get into their proposal Ed..

71
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.920
So I had actually gone through this already and picked a theme and so it gave me a theme that I can

72
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.020
use.

73
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:53.800
And as you can see here the theme is kind of it's kind of a light and fluffy and colorful theme.

74
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.150
I like using that kind of design aesthetic sometimes.

75
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.610
Now if you wanted something to be a little bit more serious they have other themes and you can swap

76
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.380
those out really easily.

77
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.620
And if you want to just swap out a theme it's pretty easy just double click anything at it theme.

78
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.170
Back then it's just up here and you swamp theme they've actually have a ton of different templates that

79
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.040
are all pretty easy to use and they're all pretty aesthetic.

80
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.350
You can do a lot of modification to these themes to make it look more custom and it can help you kind

81
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.960
of bridge the gap between now when you're using a template generator into the future when you have your

82
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.670
own design.

83
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.230
But there are plenty of other options we can use.

84
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.700
So this might be something that's a little bit more serious something that you could send to a different

85
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.930
type client.

86
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.600
Really just depends really just depends what you want really depends who you're sending it to.

87
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.830
Just kind of depends.

88
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.710
So we'll swap back to the original theme.

89
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.110
So as you can see over here it actually has all of the different sections preloaded for you and those

90
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.700
actually are preloaded from the template that we chose earlier.

91
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.600
Think it was responsive design.

92
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.130
And so they've given you a lot of the components that we actually covered previously which is great.

93
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.830
And then if you wanted to add in anything you want you can add or remove whatever it is.

94
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.980
So for instance if we didn't want to have team BIOS that might be a little excessive We can hit remove.

95
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.020
And then remember what we said about contracts we can actually remove the contracts because otherwise

96
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.750
as you can see actually ends up taking a ton of different a ton of space.

97
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:39.130
So right here is the sample contract and that's entirely too heavy and too dense for a proposal.

98
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.920
See how long it goes.

99
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.280
So you can take that out pretty easily

100
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.380
I would go ahead and remove sample case studies of course unless you wanted to have your own sample

101
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.990
case study.

102
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.150
You know the rest of it is pretty easy so it gives you everything you would need up here.

103
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.380
It gives you things like remember we talked about overview or introductions or what you do.

104
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.300
You can use this whatever way you want.

105
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.570
You can change the names you change the headers and change all the text.

106
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.690
You could insert videos you could insert images you can do your own text and do all sorts of things

107
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:21.230
graphs tables shapes you can even add things like different signature boxes if you'd prefer that people

108
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.370
sign their initials.

109
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.560
So like right here I could choose between me and the client.

110
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.950
And do you guys ever use these online signature systems.

111
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:40.120
They're a little bit difficult when using a trackpad customizing them up front relatively easy.

112
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.270
All you really have to do is just add your own image.

113
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:48.350
You could just swap it out pretty easily so you can just hit image tab over here and then it just asks

114
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.040
you if you want to drag and drop anything from their library.

115
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.080
I've already added something so we can just use our logo to give you an example to just drag and drop

116
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.250
it over here.

117
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.990
And if you're worried about it being aligned you can add grid's

118
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.960
and that helps you a little bit.

119
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:15.600
OK so these work pretty much like any other editor you've seen out there.

120
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.470
This is just helpful because it's already preloaded with all the sections that you need.

121
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:25.880
What's also great is you can modify certain sections and then save them into your content library or

122
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:31.050
hear a content library and then use them as recyclable parts later.

123
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:36.690
Now also what's interesting about these online proposal generators is that you can do things such as

124
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:42.930
insert a video and if you insert the video now you'd think if this is a PDA if you sending to someone

125
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.460
how do they see the video.

126
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.950
Well actually this is all going to be handled online.

127
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:53.970
So when I send my proposal it goes to the client because I preloaded all their information into the

128
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.880
program and they open it up in their web browser.

129
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:05.010
So it's actually a web proposal that allows them to easily share it without having to send and attach

130
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.340
attachments.

131
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:11.610
But also it allows you to use other type of multimedia that can actually help in a lot of ways and make

132
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.020
it seem more seamless.

133
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.150
I typically like doing this because especially if you're doing work online people expect you to be web

134
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:24.210
savvy and this is something that is not only convenient but helps a lot but also makes it look like

135
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.630
you are tech savvy yourself.

136
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.100
What are the biggest actually advantages to an online proposal generator compared to like what we use

137
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.940
is that you can actually handle signatures online.

138
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:41.600
And that's actually kind of a big pain with us we have to send emails with attachments with the template

139
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.960
because remember we use a semi-formal estimate style.

140
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:50.690
And then one ends up having to happen is we have to use a separate system for making signatures here.

141
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:57.180
All you do is you send it and you can have a sign here box and then you can even pre-load your own signature

142
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.150
if you want to.

143
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.000
That's my beautiful scribble.

144
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.680
And then it will handle all of that for you.

145
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.260
That's a huge huge help.

146
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:13.600
In general though if you're making a proposal and the proposal has nothing that's binding in it you

147
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.600
don't usually sign proposals it's not really something that's necessary.

148
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.210
So if you don't have the contract attached you get to the contract in a separate stage and this is what

149
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.340
I suggest you do.

150
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:28.720
Then you have them sign that they don't necessarily sign the proposal in the contract you will stipulate

151
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.510
what is the work being done.

152
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:35.500
You'll stipulate you'll stipulate the price you'll stipulate the timeline.

153
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.610
Typically you just attach these estimates to the actual contract.

154
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.870
Now the contract will say attached in Exhibit A and Exhibit B.

155
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.430
These are the binding terms of the contract.

156
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:52.480
OK so I want to show you one last thing I think this is pretty cool that you can do with online proposal

157
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:59.170
generators you can do things like snapshotting with snapshotting what you can see is you can watch a

158
00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:04.240
timeline of what's happening with the proposal so you can see how many times they've opened it see what

159
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.360
you know what sections they're stuck on or who signed it.

160
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.440
Who hasn't.

161
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.500
It's very easy to make this work with teams.

162
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.180
You can just click over and team and with team one ends up happening is you can send it to multiple

163
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:16.840
people.

164
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.100
Say you're working with a subcontractor or say you're working with a partner.

165
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.580
You can keep them and have them sign as well.

166
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.920
That's very helpful.

167
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.150
You can have your own law client portal over here where you can keep track of everyone keep all their

168
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.410
information and these are all fakes are making us as a demo.

169
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:37.900
But the last thing I think is really interesting is that you can do metrics and this is actually something

170
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.430
that can be rather helpful.

171
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:44.830
So what ends up happening is when you're sending proposals often and at a high rate these will keep

172
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:51.430
track of how many get closed and how many were accepted and you can use that kind of as a feedback process

173
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.400
to how to improve what you're doing.

174
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:58.810
What's also interesting is that you can see things like view metrics and with the metrics what you can

175
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.850
do is you can see how long they've been looking and you can see when they opened it and you can see

176
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.300
how many different people are looking at it.

177
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.110
That's helpful for you.

178
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.370
It's helpful to know if they're getting stuck.

179
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.340
If you know if they're not even spending a lot of time on it it's actually a great way of testing whether

180
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:20.020
or not they're shopping around the proposal because if they're not if they're looking at your proposal

181
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:24.750
but not for very long that could indicate to you that they're looking at a lot of different proposals.

182
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:25.830
This is all helpful.

183
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.320
This is all a lot of kind of information that can help you in many different ways.

184
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.070
So proposal phi is one of those ones that I think is probably the best out there right now.

185
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.130
I'll update the course as I find ones that are better and I can kind of refer you guys to those.

186
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.650
This one has a free trial you can use the free trial.

187
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.160
They also have a free verse.

188
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:51.210
When I suggest a software we will as a group negotiate a much lower rate.

189
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.580
Everyone in the group will get something like 50 to 75 percent off.

190
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.830
Makes it a lot easier.

191
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:02.320
One other thing as an alternative I thought also was rather interesting was one called Nusi and Nusi

192
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.950
is in you as I dot com This is an alternative.

193
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.670
Honestly guys if you're not happy with propose a fi or new C you can just Google if you just go to Google

194
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:17.400
and say proposal generator or proposal software tool.

195
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.540
There's a whole page of them and then just pick which one you think is right for you.

196
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:28.770
They're all pretty much the same except these two seem to have better features set for a lower price.

197
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.930
So with newsie it's very similar to they display everything as one long page.

198
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.340
You can view through.

199
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:39.520
They also make it really simple for you to propose multiple options.

200
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.220
That was one thing that I think that Nusi does better.

201
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.080
You can do an estimate and a timeline with a price and you can break it down.

202
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.560
But then you can also give multiple options.

203
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:53.710
So then at the very end they can pick which option they accept and tell you that they've accepted it.

204
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:58.600
It's also easy with them because all the person has to do is request more information reject or accept

205
00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:03.580
and then you can then you can have an iterative process where they rejected it comes to you and they'll

206
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:08.500
give you information about why they don't like it you can change it send it back and eventually get

207
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.760
to the point you're accepted.

208
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.640
That's all very helpful for documentation.

209
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.630
It's all very helpful if you run into problems down the line.

210
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.690
OK guys so those are two really really helpful.

211
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.080
Easy to use tools out there.

212
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.430
Not going to break the bank definitely that they can help you at the very beginning.

213
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:29.890
It was a little bit of effort and a little bit of customisation you can make these really really help

214
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.610
in terms of sales and conversion.

215
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.800
It's a good stopgap from now.

216
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.940
And you where you need proposals but you don't want to design it yourself and you don't want to spend

217
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:45.730
a lot of time working on your copywriting to use something like this and then eventually you can become

218
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.670
more professional with it and more custom design more custom information.

219
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.530
Blessing in disguise worth if you're familiar with ninety nine designs.

220
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:59.230
That is another opportunity with you do finally want to get to the point where you want to get a proposal

221
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:03.580
designed specifically for you if you're not a designer and you don't have a designer that you want to

222
00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.410
pay.

223
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:11.630
This is also very good option for you and in designs is a contest service so what you do is you will

224
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.700
give a description of what you need done.

225
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.080
You'll say I'm doing development work I need a proposal These are the sections that I want.

226
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:19.520
This is my logo logo.

227
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.850
This is my branding.

228
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.820
This is what I want this is what I like.

229
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.940
Here's an example of something that I've seen that I like.

230
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:31.100
You compile all that together and you have people compete and you'll have on average anywhere between

231
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.040
30 and 50 different designs presented to you.

232
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.390
You give them feedback and they get better and better.

233
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:41.110
And then you end up approving the one that you actually you like the designs.

234
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.230
I actually use in a lot of the things I do.

235
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.720
If you take in any Am I of course as we probably read you probably heard me talk about it before.

236
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:54.710
Very hoped for for things like Logo branding identity landing pages but also very helpful for proposals.

237
00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:00.500
And as you can see there's some people that have looked for proposals or brochures or they're all very

238
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:08.580
similar and come out with pretty decent products and it's a relatively affordable option.

239
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:15.350
In the case of Nine-Nine designs I think the minimum you have to pay is $200 and if you want to pay

240
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:20.000
more you'll get more designers and you'll get more submissions.

241
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.740
So if you guys want me to cover Nine-Nine designs specifically just let me know.

242
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.810
It's something that I kind of graze upon in a lot of other lectures.

243
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:31.390
If you're in any of my other courses or you've heard of it and you've probably seen it so.

244
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.420
So there's a lot of easy options out there for you.

245
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.110
Proposals are important.

246
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:37.430
Keep that in mind but they're not.

247
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.760
Make or break.

248
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:46.070
It's a good idea to have a system down if whether or not it's your own custom designed proposal and

249
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.900
you got done at 99 designs and you had a graphic designer make or whether or not you're generating your

250
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.920
proposals through one of these online generators.

251
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.620
It's good to have a plan in place before you start sending out your proposals.

252
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.770
It's good to be used to this before you start bringing an actual business.

253
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.200
There's a lot of benefits to using these online tools.

254
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:13.400
It makes it so much simpler for you and for them and it's also very easy to appear professional.

255
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.020
And that's what we're mainly concerned with especially at the very beginning very beginning of your

256
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.370
development business when you're struggling because you don't necessarily have the case studies that

257
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:29.750
you need or the large portfolio that you will have in the future or tons and tons of custom design and

258
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.190
custom branding.

259
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.910
So these are ways that you can get around that if you want to pay you can use new designs if you want

260
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.450
to just do a free version or 20 bucks a month.

261
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.280
You can use propose the fire Nusi.

262
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.750
Those are great great ways of getting out of it getting all right in the next lecture of what to talk

263
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.010
really quickly.

264
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.160
Just some thoughts about how much you should customize in your proposals.

265
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.290
Do you have any questions just post in the group discussion.

266
00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.970
Otherwise I'll see you in the next lecture.
