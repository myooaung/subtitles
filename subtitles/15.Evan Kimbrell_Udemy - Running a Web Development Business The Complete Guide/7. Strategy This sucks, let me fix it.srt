00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,220
You guys will come back to the course.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,430
So in this lecture I'm going to go over a strategy for getting more clients.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,540
That really is tried and true.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,480
It's something that works for big companies.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,920
It's something that works for small companies at the very beginning you're going to have a lot more

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,940
time to experiment with different marketing strategies and this is something that's really helpful especially

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,250
when you're trying to get clients from scratch.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,450
So what I call this one is this is bad.

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,590
Let me fix it.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,670
I think colloquially around the office we call it.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,050
This sucks let me fix it.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,660
But you know for you to me we keep it PGE.

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,880
So what I mean by this once you get into development and you start actually looking at portfolios and

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:53,310
looking in other people's applications and sites you'll get a lot more sensitive to quality in web sites

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,130
you get more sensitive about how they do certain things you get sensitive to what is considered good

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,440
and what is considered bad.

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,640
Now once you kind of get that sensibility and it doesn't take very long and a lot of people who just

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,970
use a lot of applications these are online a lot.

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,240
They get this as well.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,630
But once you do start to notice things that are wrong in other web sites you'll notice that commonly

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,120
a lot of Web sites have the same issues over and over and over again.

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,980
So what a marketing strategy is is that you can go to these Web sites point out something that sucks

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,290
and say you know this is bad for this reason and I can fix it for you.

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:36,330
So now you can do this on a technical level like an example would be going to someone's blog and pointing

25
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,190
out say a contact form that doesn't work.

26
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,970
Pointing out something that just doesn't look right.

27
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,480
Images overlapping point out mismatches and type graphy really kind of basic stuff.

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,300
What you can do is hey say hey this is bad.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,870
I can fix it and you can give them an estimate.

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,930
Now the return on investment on that strategy is pretty big.

31
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,790
I mean it's you're sending them a customized e-mail to them saying I can fix this this is the price

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,460
that's going to be much much better than if you just randomly emailed anybody out there who is a web

33
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,540
or mobile owner.

34
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,750
Similarly you can do it like you can point out things that could be improved.

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,250
So what you can do is kind of keep in your mind some things that are very popular that are easy to do

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,380
or somewhat time intensive to do that you think that a wide variety of people will be interested in

37
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,970
having it on their Web site.

38
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,410
Here's another example.

39
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,690
A lot of people run blogs like to collect e-mails but they don't know how to install e-mail capture

40
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,500
forms.

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,900
This is a very small example but it gets the point across what you can do is you can go to places and

42
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,740
look to see in blog rings in popular blogs and see who does not have that.

43
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,870
And you can message them that you don't even necessarily have to customize the message for each individual

44
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,000
person because problems with Web sites and problems and mobile applications they persist pretty much

45
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,350
across the board.

46
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,510
This is also very helpful if you work in a specialized niche like if you work in real estate it's very

47
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,660
easy to go to someone's web site and say this whole section is bad or something over here isn't even

48
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,740
working or be much easier if I could just install this for you give you great example real estate Web

49
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,020
sites.

50
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,650
Tons and tons of them list out all their properties.

51
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,460
But then they don't list enough information about them or they'll put photos and the photos are completely

52
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,890
formatted incorrectly.

53
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,660
You can very easily install photo browsers for them and all you have to do is say hey I can install

54
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,870
it like this and it would cost 10 hours and 10 hours.

55
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,350
Cost $400 whatever it is.

56
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,620
So this one's a little bit more creative but it's something you can do pretty much all day long look

57
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,900
for Web sites see something that you know you can fix and then tell them that and when you do it give

58
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,280
them a price.

59
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,460
Even if they're not interested you can often get referrals that way.

60
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,090
Keep in touch with you.

61
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,860
But the point is you'll get kind of first entry with a lot of new clients.

62
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,390
So always keep in mind though getting clients is the hardest part.

63
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,420
And the best part of having clients is the returning work.

64
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,360
How often they'll give you work in the future.

65
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,480
So even if it's a small gig you say $400.

66
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,440
Well you know if they have Web sites or they have mobile applications there is a good chance that they're

67
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,530
going to have other things they want to fix or other things they want to upgrade.

68
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,640
When that time comes.

69
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,380
During the first person they talk to you.

70
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,450
OK you guys go out and try this out.

71
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,450
Be responsible don't insult their website but do point out why something doesn't work how it could be

72
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:27,810
better.

73
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,580
People almost always react positively to that.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,550
Any opinions or any other techniques you'd love to share.

75
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,930
Post in the group section.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,980
Otherwise I'll see the next lecture.
