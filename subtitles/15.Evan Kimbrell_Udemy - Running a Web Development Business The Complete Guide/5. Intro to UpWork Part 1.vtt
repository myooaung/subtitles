00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.780
All right let's get acquainted with oDesk.

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.170
I would ask was the second freelancing site that I mentioned I mentioned them second because they are

3
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.540
second in size and also I think second in terms of priority at least for me when I go and I start my

4
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.920
search for a freelancer.

5
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.350
They are different than last but not by much.

6
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:39.890
If you follow tech news you will know that the oDesk and Elance actually had emerged relatively recently.

7
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.000
However they still operate to different products.

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.990
You can still go to Elance dot com and you still go to oDesk dot com.

9
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.800
So why would they merge and then keep to Web sites.

10
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.710
Well it might have to do with just the user base that they have.

11
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.060
But also I think it's that people go to oDesk for a different reason and they go to Elance oDesk focuses

12
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.810
a lot on per hour freelancing.

13
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:10.300
So they try to target businesses that are looking to hire someone indefinitely or so or to hire someone

14
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.260
say for a week or two weeks or three weeks or something like that oDesk similarly to freelancer was

15
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.970
a big venture capital company.

16
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.140
They raise something like $44 billion.

17
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.960
This is different than L.A. who raised in the 70s.

18
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.000
They have about 3.1 million freelancers on it.

19
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.610
So they're the second largest they're larger than Elance in that regard.

20
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.170
And every year they post about 3.6 million jobs which is number two is oil.

21
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.370
They're a little bit different than the land they charge 10 percent of plants was eight point seventy

22
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.860
five if you remember from the last lecture 10 percent just comes from the freelancer.

23
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.260
They also make money off of featured postings and additional kind of things you can purchase to increase

24
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.760
the visibility of your posting.

25
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.780
But once we actually get into it you'll notice that that's not exactly.

26
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.350
It's not really the case or they make a ton of money off of that.

27
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.590
They really only offer a couple things that you can upgrade for your listing.

28
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.440
Lance has a little bit more once you get to freelancer you'll notice they have an entirely different

29
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.500
business model.

30
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.640
Otis by far though is the most profitable.

31
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.520
They make close to a billion dollars a year.

32
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.160
The reason why they're so profitable is because they focus on per hour labor.

33
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:37.320
And typically when you do per hour labor freelancers are going to bill a lot more money and oDesk is

34
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.690
going to collect a lot more on their fees.

35
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.390
So you will log in and I'll show you what the user interface looks like.

36
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:53.110
It is not wildly different than the other Web sites but you'll notice it has some as centricity to it.

37
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.920
It's probably the simplest in terms of a user interface.

38
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.990
However they really do put a focus on their team environment and I'll get to that in a second to show

39
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.450
you.

40
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.570
So as you can tell I don't particularly use oDesk very often.

41
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.510
I like to focus more on plants and I like to focus more on freelancer but oDesk It's always nice to

42
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.280
use because you know if you're posting in L.A. or posting a freelancer you can always just copy and

43
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.590
paste the job posting you use to get to oDesk it's never They don't ask any questions.

44
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.120
The other two don't.

45
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.150
You can see that the

46
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.370
you can view all your job postings.

47
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.520
I have to go back in time to look at them because I don't have any open jobs right now.

48
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.070
But you can kind of see what this typically will look like.

49
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.480
Not really any different.

50
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.740
I use oDesk mainly for virtual assistance.

51
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.850
You can tell that or use it for things like bug control.

52
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.050
If I'm looking for a developer to come in to fix something and I don't know how long it's going to take

53
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.770
one or two of bugs.

54
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.220
That's just the way it kind of goes.

55
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.940
You're not going to say fix this but for $200 they have no idea if it's gonna take 2 hours or 14 hours.

56
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.920
So look at the posting user interface

57
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.530
so like ants it's pretty much the same.

58
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:23.150
You'll notice that you can take previous jobs and will repopulate for you if you want to.

59
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.190
As you notice these are mostly V.A virtual assistant tasks that I did.

60
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:29.810
That's pretty helpful.

61
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.390
They don't give you the templating versions that Elance gives you but at the same time I would typically

62
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.390
say that's not I don't mean that's not a big feature.

63
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.080
I always write my job descriptions custom.

64
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.370
I don't really need the extra help.

65
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.390
Maybe you do but regardless they don't give you that kind of structural support.

66
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.180
Same kind of system you're going to pick.

67
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.070
Generally the type of person you're looking for oDesk does have a very rich community in terms of they

68
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.740
have all sorts of different people doing different things you can get video specialist audio specialist

69
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.650
you can get legal you can get marketing companies that will charge on a per hour basis.

70
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:13.010
You really can do the whole comprehensive suite in terms of outsourcing on your desk job titles very

71
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.580
similar.

72
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.030
They actually limit the job posting your title a little bit more than the others.

73
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.250
You can write a little bit more in the description but again like we said before doesn't really matter

74
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.010
because your specifications are going to put in a separate sheet outside of the job posting.

75
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.280
This is nice because you can just list out the skills you need works very similar to Elance day.

76
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.910
Yeah I mean they just limit you to how many times you can how many different things you can list out.

77
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.560
Nothing particularly new here.

78
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.750
You'll notice that the default option is hourly you pay by the hour and verified with the work diary.

79
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.870
The reason I say default is again because oDesk really really focuses on that.

80
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.670
They focus on the hourly wage worker and fix price is really kind of a secondary thing that they they

81
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.960
use hourly.

82
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.750
You'll notice where it says pay by project for a fixed price and it says requires detailed specs.

83
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.780
That is true.

84
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.820
One of the things of hourly workers is that if you know you just have a rough budget and you know your

85
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:17.300
specifications are not ready right now you can effectively hire someone per hour and then fill them

86
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.310
in as a go.

87
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.150
I don't think it's a good strategy because I think writing the specifications out front will give you

88
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.460
more accurate estimates and also get you more acquainted with your project.

89
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.220
But for whatever reason you want to do it the other way you can do it but you can notice here that it

90
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.200
kind of reminds you you don't have detailed specs.

91
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.790
Probably not going to work for a fixed price.

92
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.090
So we'll keep it at hourly.

93
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.860
You'll notice here this is essencia NSA Trinity with oDesk.

94
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.020
They ask what your estimated duration.

95
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.420
And you'll notice here that less than one week is the smallest.

96
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.820
Typically people on oDesk are hiring people for a couple weeks.

97
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:59.120
They really don't have people that do a lot of one off jobs where they work one day or two days or three

98
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.140
days.

99
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.300
It's usually something that goes on for quite a while.

100
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.890
The people that I've hired an oDesk they worked for a month or two months or something like that.

101
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.060
More than six months.

102
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.880
That's actually quite common you see job.

103
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.100
And this is effectively a job.

104
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.270
A lot of times and oDesk people post the six month contract jobs after the six months they actually

105
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.530
end up hiring the person.

106
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.870
So I know quite a few people who've gotten their developers from oDesk by using a long term kind of

107
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.800
contract system estimated workload.

108
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:33.450
And then you know this is pretty obvious full time meaning 40 hours a week part time meeting twenty

109
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.260
fifteen twenty five hours a week as needed just means it just depends.

110
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.180
It's not really a set workload.

111
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:46.220
Maybe you need someone to just take to respond to customer e-mails in an e-mail account or something

112
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.970
like that.

113
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:52.090
You don't know how many emails and or comments you say as needed desired experience level.

114
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:58.230
This is actually quite helpful because you can say I'm looking for an entry level intermediate or expert

115
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:04.370
and depending on how complicated your application is you could pick you know expert or intermedia if

116
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:10.280
you're trying to save money by giving more detailed specs and keeping the actual development simple.

117
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.880
You can go at the entry level if you wanted to.

118
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.990
That's automatically going to filter out people that charge too much.

119
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.610
You're getting a lot of outsourcing offers.

120
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:24.170
They charge five dollars an hour six dollars an hour and you get an intermediate you're going to get

121
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:29.420
outsourcing mixed with people who are junior developers in your own country.

122
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:35.960
And you know again the outsourcers going are probably going to be like $10 $15 where the junior developers

123
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.630
in your country probably like $20 $30 or 20:25 expert.

124
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:46.220
Then you can really get into people who are charging $100 an hour $60 an hour.

125
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.620
Those people really know their stuff.

126
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.960
Similar to L.A. You can choose your job exposure.

127
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.760
This is actually interesting and Odense oDesk they have a setting called only oDesk users can find this

128
00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.680
job.

129
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:05.540
This is interesting meeting that if I come to your Web site and I'm not signed up as a freelancer I

130
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.760
cannot find your job.

131
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.960
So it's not going to show up on google it's not going to show up on the browsing section of the Web

132
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.670
site if someone just goes to the website and browse it.

133
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:20.040
That might be something you want to do if you want to keep the put the lid on kind of the promotion

134
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.540
of your application.

135
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.350
You don't want too many people reading it.

136
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.140
That's something you can put my personal opinion is you want more people looking at your application

137
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.740
regardless unless you have some super secret that you really need to hide.

138
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.890
This only means that you're going to reduce the amount of bids you get by probably 60 percent.

139
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.340
Again here's another oDesk thing that's quite specific to them.

140
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:46.080
I want to hire one freelancer I want to I need to hire more than one on e Lance when you do this you

141
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.160
would hire one freelancer and then what you would say is I want to keep hiring and then you can add

142
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.990
more here or you can stay.

143
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.730
You can specified up front.

144
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.280
Typically And you say you need to hire more than one freelancer are you going to get more bids.

145
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.030
That's just basic bidding psychology.

146
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:05.580
People are going to bid more because they think the likelihood of getting hired is much higher.

147
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:13.080
ODesk you'll notice that people who end up bidding they don't give the best kind of responses or bidding

148
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:19.770
details a lot of them will copy and paste which I think is kind of a shame considering that oDesk is

149
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:27.300
so focused on hourly wages that it seems like they should put more effort into you know being specific

150
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:33.450
as to why they're good at whatever job you're looking for or position or trying to fill because the

151
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.950
potential to make money on it is much larger.

152
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.280
Here you can see preferred qualifications.

153
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:48.030
You know this is something that if you you can get into this this is where you kind of drill down on

154
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:54.110
the ratings for freelancers you get set a minimum feedback score or you can say the freelancer type

155
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.980
here is interesting you can say independent or agency maybe you really do want an agency.

156
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.880
There are a lot of benefits to working with an agency and as lot of benefits are working with an independent.

157
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.610
You might have a specific idea of what you want and you can actually say that one of the problems in

158
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:13.380
Odessa though is if I say independent Trust me I'll get a lot of agencies and if I say Agency I'll still

159
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.370
get a lot of independents.

160
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.660
So you still need to read the bids when people bid this one.

161
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.810
Minimum feedback score.

162
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.920
I mean the thing is that if they have below whatever that the box score is you can self-select and remove

163
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.580
them.

164
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:36.030
I typically don't put this also because if I say minimum feedback score for someone can bid with a feedback

165
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.180
score of five.

166
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.490
And the reason they bid five is because they've only had one job and they got five stars and that job

167
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.010
was for 20 bucks.

168
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.150
So it doesn't really help me.

169
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:54.100
This is another thing on oDesk because they track hours and not fixed price projects as much or what

170
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.950
they'll do is on a fixed price project they'll convert that to hours.

171
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:04.900
You can actually say I want someone who has build on oDesk before and that just means that they're familiar

172
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:10.270
with oDesk they're responsible primarily you'll notice on the other web sites people kind of flake.

173
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.990
So if I said I wanted at least 100 hours billing that means that the people who are going to bid are

174
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:20.290
quite skilled or quite familiar with the service they use this quite often.

175
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.550
That means that they're not just someone who fishes on oDesk doesn't spend a lot of time on it.

176
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.250
I don't usually use this again because most freelancers bid on all three Web sites so I don't want to

177
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:37.630
limit limit it to the people who are primarily working on oDesk location very similar.

178
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:44.740
I'll show you later though you can when you search for freelancers you can search for much more specific

179
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.520
details.

180
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.320
English level this is a kind of goofy because it's self-assigned.

181
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:56.550
So if you know anyone who's bilingual a lot of times a exaggerate how fluent they are.

182
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:04.060
But if it's essentially it's self-assigned in this case you can say basic conversational fluent native

183
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.700
and it's you know I don't usually again do that one.

184
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:14.260
You can tell very quickly in the bidding and I prefer to have more people bid on my project because

185
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.770
then that makes the project look like it's popular which brings in more bids.

186
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.800
So don't try to get too specific up front.

187
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.560
You run the risk of just getting no bids whatsoever.

188
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:24.910
Cover letters.

189
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:31.660
This is a feature of oDesk when you posted job os treats this like it is a actual position.

190
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.700
So they call things interviews they call it cover letters you can add screening questions.

191
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.670
I do like this quite a bit.

192
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:47.020
Typically what I would like to add I like to add basic questions like you know so why did you apply

193
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:52.120
those particular job search experience to you.

194
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:59.920
You link and that's really helpful because there they have to actually answer that question if they're

195
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.470
going to bid they're going to have to answer it.

196
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.180
They can't just give you some copy and paste a description on their bids so they can't avoid kind of

197
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.080
the crucial questions that you have that's really helpful.

198
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.100
Cover letter is not helpful at least in my experience because they're in a cover letter it basically

199
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.640
means that they have to write a little bit saying why they're interested in what you do what you're

200
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.630
asking for and what their qualifications are.

201
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.980
Ninety nine point nine percent the time is just copy and pasted and it's just not useful so you just

202
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:33.070
have to end up reading more bulk and wasting more time and that's typically why I don't like it.

203
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.260
You can preview your posting.

204
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.310
I don't really know why.

205
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:40.630
Because it's not like you're worried about the design of your job posting.

206
00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.650
Similarly you can save a draft if you want to.

207
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.560
Pretty much every system has that.

208
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:54.380
Drafts are helpful if you want to get all your thoughts out and come back later.

209
00:14:54.380 --> 00:15:00.480
The thing is primarily your job posting is it's what your main description body is.

210
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.680
So that's what you should work on in a separate word document.

211
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.430
I don't see the point in saving a draft.

212
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.220
The biggest thing on oDesk is their team feature.

213
00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:21.230
And yes I like to even page the team feature is quite helpful if you're hiring someone who's per hour

214
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:28.030
because it will kind of keep them honest in terms of how much they're billing you how much they work.

215
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:34.940
So as you can see here I had hired two freelancers previously to do translations

216
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:47.090
this was quite a while ago and as you can tell I focus oDesk on virtual assistant tasks things like

217
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.190
for instance a translation I would need.

218
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:56.870
I don't want to charge per word per letter so I focused on just doing hourly but typically the way that

219
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:05.090
these work is they have a work diary and the work diary will show you snapshots or screenshots of how

220
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:10.130
they've worked over time since it's so old I can't really bring it up.

221
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:20.360
But the best way of describing it is they do screen shots of the person's screen every like I believe

222
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.980
it it's every minute.

223
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.710
And you can set it to do separate intervals like every five minutes.

224
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:33.080
So when someone works on oDesk they have to agree to work on through the team management system that

225
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.790
they have that's different than ads that's different than freelancer.

226
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.680
They have to use that system.

227
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.860
You can elect for them not to use it but you might as well since everyone is pretty much acquainted

228
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.030
with it anyway.

229
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:49.340
The biggest difference with oDesk though is that they're going to screen shot every single interval

230
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:55.430
of time what they're going to screenshot the person's computer screen and that's mandatory.

231
00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:01.610
Whereas Elance the work diary they entertain themselves and it kind of tracks more like every time they

232
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:08.750
message you and every time they upload information oDesk really tracks it down to some really significant

233
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:15.170
details like how many clicks they make one the the words per minute when they type so a lot of times

234
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:22.190
you have a typing or a data entry and they'll literally record how fast they're typing on their keyboard

235
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.990
and send that to you so you can see if there's a dip you can see if there are 10 of taking breaks or

236
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.670
that's something you might want to take out of your price.

237
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.780
It sounds a little micro-manager.

238
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:40.420
It can be and I don't necessarily use it every time but it's nice having that available.

239
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:50.830
If if it is something that you can consider useful you will notice see contracts like Lance oDesk will

240
00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.240
manage your contracts for you.

241
00:17:53.810 --> 00:18:00.590
But you can upload contracts if you want and they don't use it the same way Elance does in that sense

242
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.560
you could upload your own contract.

243
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.770
And how does an attachment.

244
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:08.430
Here you have to include it and like your messages are included in your job posting.

245
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.260
But it basically shows that people you sign contracts where you can download it.

246
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:18.340
That's pretty nice if you use this quite a bit again again oDesk is really focused towards having an

247
00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:23.880
army of freelancer doing freelancers doing some menial task.

248
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:30.490
And it's less focused on having a web developer say I'm going to build this web app for X amount of

249
00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:31.580
money.

250
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:38.710
It's more like you'll find a web developer says I'll build this app and pay me $50 an hour reporting

251
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:49.360
is not particularly helpful if you have a company and you are operating and you do have outsourcing

252
00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.290
needs quite a bit.

253
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:55.390
This can be helpful because they don't keep track of how many hours a week you're paying how many payments

254
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:56.900
you're giving out each week.

255
00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:02.350
He can kind of keep track of your costs so you can kind of think of this as a way to manage your outsourced

256
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.830
employees and that's kind of the way I think of it.

257
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:12.250
So if I'm earning a marketing campaign and I need to hire some people to gather e-mail addresses or

258
00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:19.330
something or web sites or find some blogs in my space I'll hire three or four people to go out at five

259
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:24.640
hours a day and I'll track through this how much I'm paying per day in over a week and that's how I

260
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:34.620
can kind of keep to keep the lid on my costs.
