00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,580
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,610
So in this lecture we're going to talk about a pretty common strategy that freelancers use and often

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,680
development firms use as well.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,570
Now this is kind of along the same vein that we talked about in the previous lecture where we talked

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,840
about giving away something of value for free.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,730
Well this is very similar to that what this strategy is called is the tutorial strategy.

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,090
OK so what I mean by a tutorial anybody who's been on YouTube sees all the time that there are people

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,980
who are screencast showing you how to do almost anything.

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,830
Mow the lawn color correct an image.

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:50,790
We're you know buying the book tutorials on how to write Gaelic lettering tutorials and pretty much

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,230
anything.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,280
Now there's a reason why people make these they're very very popular and besides the fact that YouTube

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,740
people typically make those because they get paid off the ad revenue.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,670
It's a great way of promoting yourself and promoting your brand.

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:10,380
So it's not really a big surprise that some freelancers and some freelance firms will actually use video

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,410
platforms to drive traffic back to their site.

17
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,870
Now in the same way that any random person who wants to show off a tutorial of woodworking does that.

18
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,970
Not only because they want to give to the world they also want people to recognize their name.

19
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,730
They might be paving the way for more videos later.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,840
They might actually have a Web site that they get linked to.

21
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,020
That is something to do with woodworking where they sell something that they can actually make money

22
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,370
off of.

23
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,350
Now the same thing works for development businesses a great way of optimizing your time when it comes

24
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,200
to advertising is to pick something that you are very good at and try to create a tutorial about it.

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,390
Now you don't necessarily have to just use YouTube you can use obviously Vimeo or any other video platform

26
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,560
but could also be a content strategy.

27
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,310
You can write in-depth blog post about how to do something.

28
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,050
OK so how do you determine what that something is.

29
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,800
There's two ways of going at it.

30
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:11,430
There's one you pick something that you are an expert in and two you pick something that your specific

31
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,900
client base or your specific knish cares about.

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,770
OK.

33
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,400
So the first one you pick something that you're specifically good at.

34
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:28,170
Now in this scenario you would make a YouTube video or a blog post or a guide and it would be around

35
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,820
something that you are really good at.

36
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,190
Probably something around development.

37
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,910
So if you're someone who's a master of making some script work you can make a tutorial on that if you're

38
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,540
master of javascript you could create javascript tutorials.

39
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,580
You could even teach beginners how to learn javascript.

40
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,580
You can pretty much teach any generic technical skill that you can think of that somehow relates to

41
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,780
what you do.

42
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,380
Now the reason why you do this is not only this is what you're good at.

43
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,650
Right.

44
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,210
So it should be easy for you.

45
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,580
You can literally have one of your contractors if you're not a programmer and have them make a tutorial

46
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,100
on something that you think might be popular.

47
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,920
They could cover a brand new framework that came out they could cover a big platform update.

48
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,030
They could even explain something that's very technical and explain it in a way that non-technical person

49
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,990
can understand.

50
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,150
Maybe they'll explain some technical system of how Facebook works or something like that.

51
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,550
Now the point of you doing it in your specific skill set is because it establishes you as an authority

52
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,120
figure in that specific skill kind of realm.

53
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,080
If you are a front end development firm you only do javascript each or whatever.

54
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,750
If you make tons and tons of tutorials about ways to write your code better on the front end ways to

55
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,840
use funky scripts or integrate something that's really popular.

56
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,520
People are going to trust you more.

57
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,390
And the second thing is that it also just generates a lot of traffic.

58
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,740
Now all of a sudden people are coming to your Web site for reasons other than looking for web development

59
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,010
getting done.

60
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,350
Now there's an important thing to understand here.

61
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,020
When someone comes to your Web site for some value added reason other than the fact that they're willing

62
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,560
to purchase from you that's actually a positive thing.

63
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,350
Now let me explain why.

64
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,350
So if someone comes to your website and the only reason they come there is because they're interested

65
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,710
in getting development services.

66
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:26,520
There's actually a much higher barrier for you to jump over in order to get them to purchase something

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,260
from you at that point your or just any other product or any other service firm.

68
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,870
It's really hard to distinguish you from any of the thousands of others out there that do the same thing.

69
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:41,790
But if they come to your site for another reason they come they see a tutorial they like tutorial.

70
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,500
Now all of a sudden they have positive thoughts about your company and also they hold you in now kind

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,600
of like a positive connotation.

72
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,870
They think this is the company that I got a sweet guide from.

73
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,340
I learned a skill from.

74
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,170
They did this out of the goodness of their hearts.

75
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:01,020
Now if that person is interested ever in the future with web development services they might come back

76
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,300
to you and the barrier for them to actually paying you money and taking you on for a service provider

77
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,450
is much much lower.

78
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,160
So barrier to purchase is a very important concept in development businesses.

79
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,930
If the reason why they know you is not because you're a service provider or you do development services

80
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,930
they're going to hold you in a much better light.

81
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,410
And if you then after the fact somehow introduce that you do web services they're actually going to

82
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,990
be much more likely to purchase from you.

83
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,310
It's like the difference between a cold call and a warm call a cold calls when you contact someone that

84
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,360
you have absolutely no connection with and it's immediate immediately obvious what you're trying to

85
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,410
sell to them.

86
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,080
Whereas a warm call is there is context to you talking to them right.

87
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:50,040
So if someone comes to you and they've used your tutorial guides they've heard about you that's more

88
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,160
of a warm contacts they actually have positive thoughts about you and they hold you in a positive light.

89
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,820
So it's much easier to close a deal in that scenario.

90
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:05,740
Now the other way of creating tutorials is to pick something specific that your niece wants.

91
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,360
OK.

92
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,580
So what you got to do is you have to think about your needs and think about problems that they have.

93
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,380
Now you have to think about what are these problems might be technical in some way or what are these

94
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,750
problems are things that I could solve easily and publish how to do that.

95
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:27,030
Now you'd be amazed how many people just out there in any business vertical or any neige are constantly

96
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:33,540
looking for ways to do really simple things and they just don't know how to do it because no one's published

97
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,910
a very simple easy to follow guide.

98
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,680
So to give you an example let's say we were doing a nice That was like a vertical and we have a real

99
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,760
estate company.

100
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,970
So maybe if it's a real estate company what you could do is create a guide that shows them how to install

101
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,280
a popular plug in on WordPress that helps them do some real estate function.

102
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,170
Maybe it's something that helps them email all of their prospective clients.

103
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,650
Maybe it's something that helps them embed images of their properties into email.

104
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,600
You didn't necessarily have to make it technical.

105
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,100
You could even do something like a guide on how to do advanced searching.

106
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,340
On some real estate database anything that's going to get the attention of that specific group of people

107
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,260
that's what you're going for now it's not even necessarily under the context of where a development

108
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,490
service firm and we're presenting this to you.

109
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,630
They just think that you're a technology company that knows things that they don't know and you're there

110
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,980
to help them.

111
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,110
So again you're establishing warm context and in that case you can kind of get your foot in the door

112
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:40,290
and you wouldn't be surprised if later down the road you have a contract with someone and they had actually

113
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,020
heard of you before simply because they saw that you have a lot of tutorials online.

114
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:54,810
So don't underestimate the YouTube and video blogs and even text content blogs and their ability to

115
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:01,710
attract people to your business use them correctly deliver a value make something that only takes you

116
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:09,050
honestly 30 minutes to make and that thing gets a thousand views or 2000 reads over the next year.

117
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,110
Potentially you're going to generate some buzz around your name.

118
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,700
You might establish yourself you might show off that you're good at something and those very often turn

119
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,080
into leads which turn into contract so it's all about getting your first batch of clients.

120
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,560
That's a very successful strategy.

121
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,990
You can utilize it.

122
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,110
Any other questions is posed in the group scutcheon.

123
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,410
We'll try to get into it.

124
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:37,360
Otherwise I'll see in the next lecture.
