00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:05,980
Hey guys.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,590
Welcome back to the course so let's go over seven reasons why you should start a web and or mobile application

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,360
business.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,310
Honestly there's a lot of reasons why you should start a development business.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,530
I've picked the top seven the seven that have I mean the most to me and have meant the most to everybody

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,450
here at Sprint.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,490
So some of the perks of starting a development business are pretty obvious and some of them are not

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,570
so much so much to cover a little bit of the obvious and a little bit of the not so obvious.

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:36,800
All right.

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,020
So let's start with number one.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,350
So number one it's actually very very rewarding work.

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:51,300
Tell her I mean being able to have someone come to you with the new idea here their idea from scratch

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,580
and then to see that go all the way from that napkin on a table to something that you can actually see

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,320
play with and then you start seeing people interact with that is actually very redeeming.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,930
You feel like a creator.

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,210
People who are entrepreneurs have always had a horrible problem with this.

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,970
We always think of ideas and how many of your ideas have you actually seen go all the way through the

18
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,850
process and get to the point where it's actually out in the market not enough I'd say for me probably

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,470
one in a thousand.

20
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,930
That's just how I work.

21
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:28,590
But when you run a web or mobile application development studio you get to see all these ideas come

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,770
in the door and when they come out the door the real they're alive and they're walking.

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,490
You get to really put your finger on the pulse of what's popular what's hot what's not what flies and

24
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,300
what dies.

25
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:46,590
You got to stay up to date with all sorts of breaking things in the web and in the mobile development

26
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,060
world.

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,110
You get to see what's working what's new what's out the door what's old news.

28
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,470
If you're someone who loves tech it's just a very very engaging and fun way to make money.

29
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,070
Now number two a little bit less obvious.

30
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,900
The bulk of money in any web or mobile project is in its development.

31
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:14,100
Now what I mean by that every Web online product or mobile application product has multiple sections

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,400
to it.

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,380
Typically you start with the conception stage then you move to a design phase then in development and

34
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,340
then a launch.

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,530
Now conception and launch those are two things that are typically handled in-house by your client.

36
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:32,010
But design and development are the two that are most frequently outsourced or contracted out.

37
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,500
Now within those four phases the bulk of the money goes to design and development.

38
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,230
Again like I said the other two are handled internally so every different company handles that in some

39
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,120
different way.

40
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,040
Some of them skip those processes entirely.

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:55,410
Now within design and development typically the vast majority of that work thats going to be in development

42
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,540
not in design design really can it can run the gamut if you're if you're designing something that's

43
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,040
really small it could cost you $500.

44
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,020
Maybe you are designing something that's big and you need branding with it.

45
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,270
In that case that could cost you a couple thousand dollars maybe a big fancy studio might charge you

46
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:20,880
$5000 plus but with a development project it is not very unrealistic to have a project that's well over

47
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,500
$5000.

48
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,630
Now when you design something for five hundred dollars the development side of that could easily be

49
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,370
a $10000 project.

50
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,770
Let's take for an example.

51
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,880
Let's say we're building a mobile application and we need to have it branded and we need to have it

52
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,990
completely designed and then developed from concept all the way to deployment.

53
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:48,870
Now the design and the branding and the logo and the launch icon that could cost $5000 the development

54
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,340
could cost anywhere from $10000 to $100000.

55
00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:00,120
If I had $100000 project it would probably cut down the line around 85 percent of it goes to development

56
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,670
and about 15 percent of it goes to design.

57
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,280
So developers in the development side will get the bulk of the money.

58
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,370
That's where the real opportunity to make a lot of money into scale is number three and this is something

59
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,020
a lot of people don't realize.

60
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,300
Margins in the web and mobile development are rocking.

61
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:27,990
Amazing typical product businesses out there could have margins in 10 to 20 percent of retail items

62
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,570
have margins that are as low as 5 percent.

63
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,250
An airline typically has a margin anywhere from 2 percent to 4 percent of custom web or mobile development

64
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,380
project.

65
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,860
The margins can be as low as 25 percent and as high as 70 percent.

66
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,100
Now obviously not going to tell you exactly what our margins here at Sprint.

67
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,950
When we first started out they were literally 50 50.

68
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,200
Now they're a little bit different but they're healthy margins.

69
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,060
Now if you're somebody is coming at this and you're non-technical you're going to be subcontracting

70
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,390
primarily when you subcontract your margins are clear and simple.

71
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:12,070
And they usually fit within that 25 to 70 percent range if you're developing it yourself.

72
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,650
Well it's hard to think of margins but what ends up happening is you can pay yourself a fantastic wage

73
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,850
that you never would have gotten if it was just you freelancing on your own.

74
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,680
The best part about doing this as a developer it's like you can magically double yourself all of a sudden

75
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,110
if you make $50 an hour you start taking a larger project have someone work next to you and then someone

76
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,700
work next to that person.

77
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,300
It's all of a sudden you're like you've multiplied yourself.

78
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,810
And like if you multiplied yourself you are going to get a lot more done and you're also going to make

79
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,070
a lot more money.

80
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:48,760
Number four you set yourself up for startup success in the future.

81
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,470
Now what do I mean by that.

82
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,510
Well think about it.

83
00:05:51,530 --> 00:06:00,770
You have spent all this time putting together a well oiled slick professional team to make awesome web

84
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,740
mobile projects right.

85
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,920
You go through trials and tribulations you work with different freelancers you figure out who's good

86
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,040
at what you piece them together.

87
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,050
You create an awesome system and an awesome product.

88
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,090
Now when you have an idea all you have to do is flip the switch and point that system at whatever it

89
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,160
is you're trying to build.

90
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:25,040
Regular founders they take months to find the right people and they could potentially take years to

91
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,910
figure out who fits in their organization who doesn't.

92
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,180
What does everybody good at.

93
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,010
What are we capable of building you as someone who runs a development business.

94
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,820
You have that pretty much from day one when ever you want to start your own thing.

95
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,330
Think of it like a factory you are producing product after product after product and it's getting better

96
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,390
and better and better.

97
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,140
All you have to do is decide that the next one coming off the production line is yours.

98
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,250
Great example of this.

99
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,120
37 Signals company out of Chicago started as a web development studio.

100
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,520
They created base camp as a project to solve a problem they had internally.

101
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,100
Then they created some other ones like camp fire and high rise.

102
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,760
Now they're a billion dollar product company.

103
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:14,090
Number five you're going to get exposure to a wide variety of online disciplines disciplines that it's

104
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,590
very hard and take years and years to get experience with.

105
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,430
You're going to learn project management you're going to learn client management you're going to learn

106
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,050
sales management you're going to learn how to manage accounts you're going to learn how to hire how

107
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,980
to fire how to vet people how to recruit them how to figure out who's good and who's not.

108
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:39,470
You're going to develop basic skills in product management and you X user experience you are after all

109
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,340
in charge of making a successful product that successful product involves understanding user experience

110
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,670
understanding the product managing IT managing its feature set.

111
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,810
These are all very very in-demand skills skills that if this doesn't work out for you you can go and

112
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,730
pick up a job in any of them.

113
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,010
You're going to learn how to go out and get your own sales.

114
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,990
You're going to learn how to prospect clients you're going to learn how do you get the good clients

115
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,080
and how to keep them.

116
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,410
You got to learn the basics of account management.

117
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:15,770
You're going to get a wide variety of exposure to different technologies you're really going to understand

118
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,720
your craft at the end of this even if you're not a developer.

119
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,350
You're going to talk like a developer.

120
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,870
You're going to be able to actually communicate with your development team.

121
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,530
You know what works and what doesn't work.

122
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,210
You know you're in a perfect situation to assess what's hot what's not.

123
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,940
So how else would you possibly get experience in all of these rounds.

124
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,580
I can't think of really anywhere else you could do this.

125
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,060
Number six the opportunity to set it and forget it.

126
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,670
So for those of you out there that are looking for a passive income source actually web development

127
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,730
mobile development it's actually a great opportunity.

128
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,720
Now you probably think to yourself what do you mean are you constantly busy bringing in new clients

129
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,970
managing them managing projects will not actually if you wanted this to be a passive income source you

130
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,640
would just work on getting a couple good clients and then making sure that you have your process down

131
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,400
and you continue to work with them and retain them if that's the case and you work with agile methodologies

132
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,140
which we'll cover later in the course you're going to be literally checking in on your projects every

133
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,090
two weeks when you get paid.

134
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:17,720
So that's it.

135
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,690
You have two clients three clients four clients that means you have four meetings every other Friday.

136
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,190
The rest of the time the other two weeks you do whatever you want.

137
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,080
I used to run Sprint kick were living in India then living in Thailand then traveling all over the world

138
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,160
number seven.

139
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,390
And I think honestly this is one of the best reasons because it's the most immediate.

140
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,970
It's something that can help you today.

141
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,270
For those of you out there that are freelancers people out there who run a consulting business people

142
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:53,690
who do marketing for their own clients if you do design for your own clients maybe you run an NCO outfit.

143
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,310
Imagine the power of being able to say to your clients and you've already gone through the hard work

144
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,080
of getting Hey what I can also do the development for you.

145
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,060
Now remember development is the bulk of the money.

146
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,810
Now we're also going to cover later in the course.

147
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,600
Reasons why clients stick with you.

148
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,090
And one of the biggest reasons why they'll stick with you is because you can take care of all their

149
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,840
needs.

150
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,900
Now all of a sudden you're one step farther doing full service.

151
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,410
You can say not only can design it I can also develop it.

152
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,630
Now if you're not a developer don't worry we're going to cover this from the non-technical perspective

153
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,450
as well as the technical perspective.

154
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:33,200
I'm going to show you how you can contract it out and build a really good team to do this.

155
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,530
Even if you can't program.

156
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:41,760
So this is one of the best self-employment small business consulting hacks I've ever seen.

157
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,860
I've seen as CEO outfits or designers that go from making $3000 a month with the same with the clients

158
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,980
that go to making ten or fifteen thousand dollars a month for the same exact client.

159
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,540
So they're not even doing anything.

160
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,640
They're not creating new relationships they're not even doing sales they're just offering another service.

161
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,640
OK you guys have seven reasons wasn't enough.

162
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,580
You're just going to have to watch the rest of the course and come up with your own reasons.

163
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,460
I'm excited to teach this course so let's get into it.

164
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,340
I'll see in the next lecture.
