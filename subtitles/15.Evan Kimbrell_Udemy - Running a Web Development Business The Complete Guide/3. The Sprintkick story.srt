00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,050
Hey guys welcome back to the course so I thought this would be a kind of a fun lecture record talk a

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,390
little bit about what the story was spread.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,410
Where do we start.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,070
How did we end up where we are today.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,750
So a lot of people don't actually realize this but I actually started Sprint kick drum roll in India

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,950
not Indiana.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,390
Actually in India I had moved there to start it.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,480
So before spring kick actually worked at the venture capital firm and a lot of what I did is I would

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,490
embed myself with small teams that had only received a moderate amount of funding and were going for

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,840
the next big round.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,690
The number one thing I saw over and over and over again was the inability to recruit technical people

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,910
and find good engineers.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,100
And so that's kind of where I came up with the idea that well it seems like everybody should actually

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,360
have the opportunity to outsource or at least contract out this work.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,910
They just need to get over the stigma and they need someone who can actually help them bridge the communication

16
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,250
problem with the contractor or the project management problem with an outsourced firm.

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,090
So in one of the crazier decisions I've made my life I decided to actually move to a city called Hyderabad

18
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,230
and in Hyderabad Well I didn't wasn't immediately successful at first.

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,530
Once it was actually in India what I did is I started putting together the best team I could.

20
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,520
I have a lot of experience with outsourcing and I had known that the only difference between a good

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,380
project with an outsourced team and a bad project to the team is your project management layer.

22
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,170
The people who build your projects in other countries they're just every bit as brilliant technically

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,680
as the people that you would hire say in the United States or in Europe.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,730
The problem is just communication and the problem is just different standards.

25
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,700
So I knew that I could insert myself into the mix and I could essentially be the catalyst from taking

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,250
cheap and turning it into good.

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:57,100
It took a lot of time and a lot of grinding it out took a lot of learning learning on a higher in India

28
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,450
is incredibly strange and incredibly difficult.

29
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,510
I learned that we had problems with putting people the same religion in the same room.

30
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:09,810
I had learned that certain people have problems with air conditioning as other ones do not.

31
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,050
I had learned that holiday schedules were incredibly difficult to build around.

32
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,160
Nevertheless it only took about a year before I put together the core team and build a client base that

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,300
actually could support growing the company and what I actually did as I started growing backwards.

34
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,650
So after that I actually worked backwards and started adding people in-house in the United States.

35
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,400
A lot of people do it the other way around right to start with employees and then add contractors on

36
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,440
top of that.

37
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,620
There's no reason you can't do it the other way around.

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,660
So fast forward pretty much three years later I've learned a ton about running web development businesses

39
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,990
snowballed a lot of mistakes and I've kind of accumulated a lot of strategies and skills and I've put

40
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,480
this all pretty locked into this course now where we are today.

41
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,740
We're a referral only agency.

42
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,780
What that means is we only accept new clients if we have a referral.

43
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,510
We've finally gotten to the point where we can pick exactly who we want to work with because we know

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,010
we're at the size that we're happy with and we know that we have a growth rate that we're happy with.

45
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,310
We're also happy to say that we're almost 90 percent distributed.

46
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,680
We run pretty much everything outside of the home base with a very small core.

47
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,940
We like to focus on having in-house designers because that's probably the best value you can get.

48
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,710
Great designers make great projects.

49
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:34,260
We're going to cover that later in the course but everything else can be contracted for the cost savings

50
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,980
and for the flexibility We've also expanded into a lot of different things.

51
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,530
We originally started with just webapps and then we expanded into mobile applications and we even expanded

52
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,170
into things like BlackBerry and Windows phone which I thought no one cared about.

53
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:53,520
We've also put a lot of effort into add on services focusing on offering graphic design as well as offering

54
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,630
help with launching and strategy consulting.

55
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,560
We've started to do that because we've realized that it's easier to grab on to one client and hold them

56
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,480
and charge more than it is they find lots and lots of different clients and only take control of one

57
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,160
section of their product launch.

58
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,230
So if you guys ever want to reach out just message me or post in the group discussion I am more than

59
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,660
willing to have a chat or help you out with any issues that you're having.

60
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,210
Hopefully through this course and through everything I'm about to teach you you're going to learn an

61
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,370
enormous amount and you're going to see the same successful growth that I saw.

62
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,480
But in a fraction of the time that's the point of this course.

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,290
I can't wait to see what you guys do with this course.

64
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,510
I'd love to see successful student testimonials.

65
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,410
I'd love to see you guys take the techniques that we're going to teach in this course and implement

66
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,680
them for yourselves.

67
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,440
I love it when you guys collaborate and add in some extra stuff that works for you as well.

68
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,260
All right guys like usual questions posed in the group discussion.

69
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,600
Any comments anything like that.

70
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:57,180
Otherwise see in the next lecture.
