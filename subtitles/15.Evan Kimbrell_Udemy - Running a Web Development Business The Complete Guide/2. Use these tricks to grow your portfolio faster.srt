00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,310
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:16,050
We're going to cover some of my favorite kind of tips and hacks for growing your portfolio much faster

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:22,080
at the very beginning and to close that gap between established firms and you your upstart and a much

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,400
quicker amount of time.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,530
So this is one of those things that like you would not have the slightest idea about this unless you

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,290
had some experience in development already.

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,990
So what are the very biggest issues when you're starting out your development business is that clients

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,570
almost immediately will ask for a portfolio or some kind of statement of work something that shows what

9
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,620
you've built before.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,070
Your response probably is going to be something along the lines of Oops.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,530
Now a lot of people they just quit right there because realistically if you can't prove that you built

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,750
something before well then it's really hard to land a contract.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,670
Now what a lot of people don't realize is that there are some really easy ways to build out a portfolio.

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,690
We're going to cover more techniques later in this section but we're going to go over a couple of my

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,650
favorites right now.

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,810
So number one this is one that no one realizes this.

17
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,310
You can list your own projects.

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,690
Now what do I mean by this.

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,610
You probably have projects from the past that you were part of you built yourself you had built for

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:20,840
you.

21
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,100
You were part of the team for now you can list those as your portfolio.

22
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,700
Why.

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,360
Well because presumably you had an intimate relationship with the application and the final product

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,920
quality had a lot to do with you.

25
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,210
Now why is that acceptable.

26
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:44,010
Well when people list portfolios they list their portfolio items in totality they list a Web site that

27
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,090
they worked on.

28
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:45,770
Right.

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,010
But you don't know exactly what they did on that Web site.

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,450
A lot of times they'll annotate it.

31
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,590
That's probably what you should do as well but you have to understand if you participated in that project

32
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:01,830
it's worth posting it just to show you're part of that team you are at least high enough caliber to

33
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,640
work with that group or at least to show that you know at least this portion of it is from me.

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,030
Now you can list on your portfolio what exactly you did but you also don't really need to scream that

35
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,050
you didn't build it yourself from scratch.

36
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,530
Ninety percent of the time clients won't even really ask you because it's not a huge concern to them

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,660
if they ask you just specify what exactly you did or if you want to avoid that entirely and then just

38
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,810
post it along with your portfolio.

39
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,350
Now I did this with my side projects when I started.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,300
I'd done a lot of outsourcing projects previously and so obviously I can show off what I've built because

41
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,500
clearly I'm capable of rebuilding that in the future.

42
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,800
That's the point.

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,130
Portfolios are basically snapshots of what you're capable of making.

44
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,400
Now if you follow the sub contracting path.

45
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,300
Another thing you can do is that you can use your contractor's portfolio they personally have things

46
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,410
that they have built.

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,720
And so it's realistic to say this is something that I can build assuming that you're going to be using

48
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,200
that contractor at the very beginning of Sprint.

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,960
I worked with a firm and the firm would tackle entire projects for me.

50
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:14,710
So it made sense to show what they can build considering that what I'm offering is them plus me.

51
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,570
Again what's important is that you show what you can do not necessarily what exactly you have built

52
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,280
yourself.

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,250
Now at the very beginning this can be kind of a growth hack.

54
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,660
It's something that you can use to out of the gate have something to show.

55
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,560
Obviously it's not going to be perfect right unless you're working with a contractor for the long term.

56
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,440
They have an amazing portfolio but it's something at the very beginning that'll do it's kind of a stopgap

57
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,970
strategy over time.

58
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:49,290
Realistically what you should do is start curating your portfolio start cycling out the items that you

59
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:56,730
did not do the entirety of and focus more on better projects projects that you did kind of in totality

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,550
over time also you going to start pruning it a little bit to look for consistency in your portfolio

61
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,140
items.

62
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,740
You're just getting really picky as you build more and more projects.

63
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,630
But the very beginning this is perfectly fine.

64
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,580
It's great to get smaller contracts or lower pressure contracts pretty much upfront.

65
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,160
Okay guys so those you're out there that are totally worried you have nothing to show you do have something

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,360
to show you just got to think about it.

67
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,150
So any questions posed in the group discussion.

68
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,920
Any other suggestions that worked for you posted in there.

69
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,680
Otherwise to see in the next lecture.
