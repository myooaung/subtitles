00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:11,220
You guys actually the chorus so quick lecture on a big mistake you probably might be making.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,130
So in general this is something you want to avoid when talking with clients don't talk about problems

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,280
just tell them what is happening.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,340
Now the biggest difference between those two is one you're just being literal saying what's happening.

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,450
And the other one you're kind of being ambiguous and you're framing the discussion in a way that says

6
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:36,360
whatever this is that's happening is a problem and it's something to be worried about now vendors don't

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,790
have problems they have setbacks.

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,280
That's something you need to kind of keep in your mind because clients are read those two things in

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,390
completely different ways.

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,440
A setback is just something that happens all the time.

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:54,030
Something that they should have been aware of before they started the project and a problem is something

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,650
they've never seen before and it's something that I should be worried about.

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,920
Everyone should be worried about.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,810
It's a big deal.

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,130
There's a really big difference between this is broken and this part is sending the wrong information

16
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,990
saying this is broken.

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,000
It just saying that something's not wrong with it and I don't even know what it is.

18
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,660
Shows that you don't know what it is and it shows that it's potentially a problem and problem is a word

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,970
you don't ever want to use.

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,550
So when working with clients try to be as literal as possible.

21
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,150
Setbacks happen but when they do happen tell them what exactly is happening and how long it's going

22
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,280
to take to get out of this snag.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,800
Nothing is ever unsolvable.

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,130
Whether or not that's actually true does it matter when you're talking to a client.

25
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,160
Nothing.

26
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,480
Nothing is ever unsolvable.

27
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,240
If you don't know what the problem is and you attempt to articulate it it might sound vague.

28
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:52,320
So just keep in mind stay away from being vague vague implies problem using generalized terms like broken

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,180
doesn't work.

30
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,740
Those things they convey that there's a bigger issue at hand if you're just literal and say this does

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,310
not do this and we're going to fix it.

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,460
That's not a problem.

33
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,340
So try to remove that language from your vocabulary.

34
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,320
It'll help you out quite a bit.

35
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,250
Guys any questions posed to the group discussion.

36
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,380
Otherwise see in the next lecture

37
