00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey guys.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,590
Welcome back to the course in this lecture.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,040
We're going to talk about sniffing out your client's budget.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,020
What do I mean by that.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,960
Well when you start the project process very beginning first point of contact with the potential new

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,830
client.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,960
There's a lot of back and forth that happens before you guys agree on what you're building how much

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,420
it costs and what your timeline is going to be.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,050
That process I just described actually can take up a considerable amount of time.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,350
Larger projects have a lot of back and forth a lot of estimation a lot of re estimation and a lot of

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,330
negotiation.

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,120
Now it's in your best interest to minimize how many times you go through this process.

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,400
For clients that don't end up working with you or becoming paying clients.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,660
And one of the biggest reasons why clients drop out is because of the budget either they don't have

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,940
the money to make it or they're just not confident they can get the money or they have enough money

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,160
to build the project they want to build a lot of times they have money but it will require them scaling

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,360
down their application.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,420
Now it's important for you to have some general idea of your client's budget while you're going through

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,940
this process for a couple of reasons.

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,370
One that it's helpful for you because you can shift resources if you believe you're with a client that's

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,650
unrealistic.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,750
You can also change your strategy.

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,970
Start pushing them them towards things that are more practical more cost effective.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:35,580
Start pushing them towards more of a minimum viable product model and essentially just try to pitch

25
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,920
them on the whole idea they should start off smaller but also what ends up happening is a lot of times

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,380
if you work with clients you no idea what their budget is they'll accept a project and they simply do

27
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,510
not have the funds or they're not in a good enough cash position to make the project correctly.

28
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,090
A lot of times they build something out and they quite literally spend every dollar they have building

29
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,380
it.

30
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,890
And then when it needs editing it needs fixes when you find out that user feedback says this section

31
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,740
doesn't work.

32
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,760
This section needs to be fixed they have nothing to work with.

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,580
And so you're working with a dead project now and you just stress this that a lot of contractors will

34
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,400
ask for your budget up front.

35
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,170
It's surprising how many people do that and it's something that you should never do.

36
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:26,730
It's it's such bad manners it's so really unprofessional and I'm kind of amazed by the people that actually

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,120
stick by asking what the client's project is upfront.

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,980
I teach other courses on you to me where I actually take the other side of the fence and I teach people

39
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:43,380
how to be a master at purchasing software and mastering kind of the freelancer business relationship.

40
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,960
And I always say that people that ask for their budget upfront are more likely to be unrealistic about

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,150
what it's going to take to get your project done.

42
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,360
It's also just bad taste.

43
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,470
If I'm someone who's looking for a long term contractor or someone to work on a very important project

44
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,820
I'm not going to be interested in working with someone whose first question is how much money do you

45
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,140
have to spend.

46
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,920
I'm interested in someone who is interested in my project.

47
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,340
I would like to work with someone who has a personal connection to it.

48
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,450
You should follow that as well.

49
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,840
You should always make your client feel as if you are interested in what they're doing.

50
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,820
Make it look like you're thinking about it in other ways and that money is not the most important issue

51
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,860
an issue to you.

52
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,980
What are the things that always drives me crazy with other freelance businesses is they ask for your

53
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,370
budget and if you tell them your budget you magically you'll find out that their estimates always seem

54
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,330
to fit your budget.

55
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,360
That's typically just shows that a lot of people use that as a technique to be dishonest.

56
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,280
They use it to figure out how much money they can squeeze out of you and not to objectively answer the

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,350
question of how much does this cost.

58
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,640
What is it going to take.

59
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,250
So be realistic.

60
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,250
Get your priorities right.

61
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,480
And don't ask for your budget up front.

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,120
But there are some certain things that can help you understand roughly whether or not your client is

63
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,400
even in the right range of your project and to give you some idea of whether or not they have a healthy

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,690
budget or a budget that simply cannot support the project they're proposing.

65
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:19,350
So I'm going to go over some of the most common things you should look for and some simple ways that

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,130
you can actually press the issue find out what their budget is without actually asking explicitly and

67
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,030
being rude.

68
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,900
Now this is not an exhaustive list but these are the ones that I see coming up all the time.

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,330
If you guys have other ones post in the group discussion can definitely add them in here.

70
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,920
That would actually be quite helpful.

71
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,350
These are the ones I've seen.

72
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:39,690
OK.

73
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,660
So number one.

74
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,080
This is something that I see constantly.

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,540
Do you have a client that is constantly assuring you that a section that they're proposing to build

76
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,160
is really simple or really cheap despite how educated your client thinks they are.

77
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,610
They don't ever know how big a project is.

78
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:03,530
They very rarely have the slightest inclination how a section is they're wrong more often than they're

79
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,100
right.

80
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,630
And I also kind of believe that most clients at least subconsciously understand that they don't know

81
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,700
what they're talking about what's happening though when they're doing this is they're signaling to you

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,980
budget is probably a concern.

83
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,780
I'm telling you this is simple in the hopes that you believe that it's simple and you return to me a

84
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,750
price that is quite reasonable.

85
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,570
Now someone who has a budget that's easily going to encompass this project they're not going to be as

86
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,790
concerned with telling you how simple projects pieces are.

87
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:40,700
Number two look for how much specificity your client gives you a client that gives you 16 20 25 pages

88
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,250
of documentation.

89
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:50,030
Wireframe specifications that person is probably more realistic and probably more aware of how big their

90
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,080
project is.

91
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,450
People who have gone and actually done each individual section probably has a decent idea of whether

92
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,880
or not this is a big project a medium project or a small project and consequently they are probably

93
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,080
more realistic about what the price is going to be if they're coming to you and they have all of this

94
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,330
sketched out all of this planned out not only are they more serious about the project they probably

95
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,470
have the budget to pursue this.

96
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:19,070
People who go through and map out the entire thing don't usually get to the point where they're asking

97
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,390
for your services unless they are pretty confident they can pay for it.

98
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:29,000
Now people who are completely clueless who just email you saying I want to build Instagram.

99
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,220
Those people have absolutely Probably no idea how much it's going to cost because they have no idea

100
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,420
what the cost range is.

101
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,880
It's less likely that they are realistic about price or have the money to pay for it.

102
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,280
Number three this is something I see quite often it's the I versus we when typically when someone says

103
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,620
I assume it's a person but when you hear people say we my partner and I.

104
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,520
That basically means there's multiple people making this purchasing decision.

105
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,790
Now you might not read into that too much but in my experience typically when they have partners that

106
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,750
means They're pooling their money together.

107
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,600
Typically when they say we it's multiple people they brought someone on the more serious about this

108
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,530
and there's multiple people to draw from to bring in money.

109
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,360
A lot of times you're talking to the entrepreneur.

110
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,340
The we refers to the entrepreneur and their limited partner the partner who provides the cash.

111
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,110
Now that's not a rule across the board.

112
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,990
Plenty of partnerships don't have the money to work with you and plenty of single individuals do.

113
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:32,750
But just statistically more people are probably going to have access to more disposable income and more

114
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,550
funds.

115
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,400
So typically groups of people are more likely to be able to pay for it.

116
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,640
Number four consider how much you know about the client.

117
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,570
A lot of times you will go through hours and hours and hours of estimating going back and forth discussing

118
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,360
and it occurs to you you have no idea what this client does for money.

119
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,890
Are they a past entrepreneur.

120
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:56,320
Do they work for a giant company or their college student you have no idea who they are.

121
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,860
Typically if you're working with someone who's employed and they're doing this on the side if they're

122
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,850
at a point in their career where they're thinking about side projects and they're willing to purchase

123
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:11,560
software on a side they're probably more realistic about what it's going to cost and they probably have

124
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,140
been putting away money to pay for this for a while.

125
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,640
Now if you're talking to someone like a college student that's not usually the case unless you're asking

126
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,080
the kid who lives off a trust fund.

127
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:27,680
They're probably just completely and realistic they're probably overly idealistic about their project

128
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,200
or they think it's abnormally simple to build and they have no idea what development projects cost.

129
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:39,080
So if they have a job chances are they have been putting money aside and they probably have some of

130
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,800
a budget not a huge one but enough to build a decent application.

131
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,690
So number five how quickly do they go through the process.

132
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,910
That's something you'll notice very quickly.

133
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,790
Some people will go through seven rounds of discussion in seven days.

134
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,070
Some of them will go through seven rounds of discussion over the course of four months.

135
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:06,260
Typically the ones that respond quicker are less concerned or have fewer issues with what you're proposing

136
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,470
them.

137
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,270
Often it's the case that if they're speeding through the process that's because money is not an issue

138
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:15,290
to them or they don't see it as something that's insurmountable.

139
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,520
Now there are exceptions to this rule a lot of times you will find people who just love kind of going

140
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,160
through the process trying to get the most out of it and they've not even thought about the price.

141
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,400
But that's usually the exception and not the rule.

142
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,550
Typically people who respond quickly are confident about what you're telling them and they're confident

143
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,000
about pursuing this project.

144
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,060
If someone's delaying they could be slow rolling you could just be waiting and waiting and waiting because

145
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,130
they don't like what they hear and they don't think they can pull it together.

146
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:47,060
Another one you'll notice as a red flag is do they ask for additional feature estimates.

147
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,330
And then you notice that in the total project it never gets added.

148
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,590
I have this all the time.

149
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,470
People ask for I want this really big project.

150
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,060
And can you tell me on the side what does this and this will cost.

151
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,990
And then when you go back to piled the complete estimate they're removing those estimates you gave them

152
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,300
or you never see them incorporate that into their larger estimate.

153
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,530
Now again as a rule not a 100 percent true but typically what's happening is they're not including that

154
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,010
estimate.

155
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,600
It means it's either non-essential or they can't afford it.

156
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,350
So it's usually one or the other.

157
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,250
If they keep doing this over and over it happens a lot.

158
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,130
You have someone say how much for this.

159
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,060
OK and you tell them and they say no then they say how much for this.

160
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,040
You tell them they say no they'll keep doing it back and forth until they can figure something that

161
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,270
they can fit in the budget.

162
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:39,840
Typically that signals constrained budget probably only have enough for the main project and not much

163
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,450
else.

164
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,880
Probably not a healthy budget.

165
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:48,240
And number seven this is just a technique and this is the last one I'm going to go over for figuring

166
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,440
out whether or not they have the budget.

167
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,000
If you watch the other lecture we talk about ballpark estimates.

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,540
Those are incredibly useful when you can actually use those as kind of an exploratory tool.

169
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,500
When you have somebody asking you questions you know how about this.

170
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,130
How about this.

171
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:02,670
How about this.

172
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,550
What if I did this and you're not feeling whether or not they have the budget or you're concerned about

173
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,910
it.

174
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,920
Often what you can do and it will save you a ton of time is just go ahead and do the ballpark estimate.

175
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,620
And in one of your e-mail correspondence says just tell them hey you know this whole thing probably

176
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,630
if I had to guess is 400 to 600 hours or whatever that ends up being for you.

177
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,510
Ten to fifteen thousand dollars and just leave that out there.

178
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,910
See how they respond if they skip over that without a beat.

179
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,400
Then they probably are perfectly fine.

180
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:40,110
That's not really an issue but if someone doesn't have the budget for that that'll stop them dead in

181
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,340
their tracks.

182
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,180
And now you know they probably didn't have the budget you can apply your resources and apply your time

183
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,080
elsewhere.

184
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:52,020
OK guys so those are pretty much the seven things and kind of red flags that I've noticed.

185
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,810
The best way I honestly if you're in doubt give them a ballpark estimate.

186
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,700
That'll pretty much shut it down if they keep going past that point.

187
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,760
You're pretty good.

188
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,370
Other than that just try to use your spider sense and think about their partners.

189
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,900
Are they employed.

190
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,880
How quickly are they responding.

191
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,970
How much thought have they put into this project.

192
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,590
Are they really insistent that certain sections are really small or inexpensive.

193
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:21,100
Do they ask for features and never seem to add them to the bigger project.

194
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,410
OK guys be aware of those things.

195
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,420
Look for them if you have any other things that you've noticed yourself in your experience posts in

196
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,170
the group discussion.

197
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:38,610
I'd love to hear it otherwise see in the next lecture.
