1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,610
So with that being said we can actually go over to theme Forest which is another fantastic source for

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,300
templates.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,950
Another one that I like considerably.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
I like this on a lot better than template monster.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,040
They don't have as many templates technically that would fit within what we're looking for but they're

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,120
still incredibly useful.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,620
So like so like template monster you can see that everything's divided off into sections.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,930
We typically would just pick if we are using a platform you'd pick a section and then just go to it.

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,520
They have a distinction here between PTSD and HVM.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,880
What does that mean if you're not familiar is the Dotsie extension for Photoshop and it just means Photoshop

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,280
design file.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,920
And so what that would mean is that they're going to give you a photoshop file.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,370
If you're someone who uses Photoshop has a little bit of design skills or is planning on making a significant

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,990
amount of edits to your photoshop file.

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,680
Then it's a good idea to come over here and just download it here.

16
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:13,650
Now if you do not want to say make a ton of graphic edits to it and you would rather have something

17
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,040
that's ready to upload on your own web site then you can use HDMI.

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,650
And then the last thing obviously is if you want to install this onto another system you can pick Wordpress

19
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,710
or any of these other generic CMOS systems.

20
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,870
OK so they've done that for you that's incredibly useful for us.

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,890
You just use it virtually the same way.

22
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:40,600
I mean I could just say web design and that's going to give me a significantly large group of very good

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,370
designs that are very helpful.

24
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,350
And so like typical monster here we can actually you know pick our price.

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,190
This is helpful because on thin forest they allow their designers to pick their own price.

26
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,340
That's why you see such a massive fluctuation.

27
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,540
This guy wants $8.

28
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,230
This guy wants $43.

29
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,330
There's even a ratings to as well to see if there's something wrong with it or down the line if something

30
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:06,460
doesn't work or if something in the advertising isn't what it should be.

31
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,850
So this works very very much in the same way.

32
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:17,440
You can also go and pick based off of a category and what you can do is quite literally just pick whatever

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,280
format you want.

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,400
So let's say we're looking at Photoshop files you typically want to get creative because creative in

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,250
this case is going to sum up any type of consulting business any type of design business.

36
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,290
They consider development businesses under Creative not under technology.

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,240
Do you go to technology to get a lot of templates of server pictures and just things that are way too

38
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,510
generic typically around like hardware.

39
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,860
So we're actually going to create.

40
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,850
So there's plenty of ones in here that work really really well.

41
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:55,990
You know right off the bat Here's one that's perfectly made for anyone who wanted to do a minimalist

42
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,070
design.

43
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:02,800
The biggest benefit you'll notice here is if you go ahead and you won't want the photoshop file and

44
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,700
not the HD mail or the wordpress.

45
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,560
That typically means that the person who uploaded this had to put less work into it.

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,370
So what I'm looking at this you'll notice the prices are consistently lower.

47
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,950
Never over 12 dollars.

48
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,680
That's why you would go after a photoshop file.

49
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,560
Obviously you also get to edit it on a much more deeper level.

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,830
But it's also significantly cheaper so if you really are trying to pinch pennies go for this option

51
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,580
just to give you a quick kind of view of how their UI works.

52
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,770
It's very very similar to template monster.

53
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,080
You can just do screenshots.

54
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,860
They also do live demos.

55
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,690
So right here you know this is a great example of another page that could be really retrofit for anything.

56
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:55,990
They've already made it sound like you're a studio as you can see it has a portfolio section it allows

57
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,820
you to put a hook and even allows you to have a call of action button if you want to you know promote

58
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,540
something else that's going on whatever it could be.

59
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,850
It also put sections here for if you want to add in a blog and testimonials and contact us you'll notice

60
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,380
these are all very much kind of within the same kind of realm.

61
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,110
This is helpful if you wanted something else very very minimalist.

62
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,300
OK so the last thing I want to show you with the theme forest is that the forest allows you to attach

63
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,720
certain adjectives to your search results which is incredibly helpful.

64
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,750
So over here what you have are called tags and tags are just very helpful because you can get much more

65
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,450
specific with what you're looking for.

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,770
On theme on template monster you would have to physically search for it and it's then a question about

67
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,390
whether or not it's designed or tagged correctly.

68
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,940
So why is this helpful.

69
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,070
Well if you're really picky about the design you wanted for instance minimal.

70
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,300
OK if you want to say that was very minimal very simple and that was something that you kind of wanted

71
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,840
to promote as one of your value proposition points then you pick this flat if you wanted to flat design

72
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,310
if you specifically thought that design was the best looking or you wanted to convey to other people

73
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,700
that your trendy kind of up on it you could use flash and flash is you know very kind of controversial

74
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,860
in the design community but if that's something that you specifically wanted to convey try it out these

75
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,350
templates are so cheap that honestly you can test with them.

76
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,110
You can try one thing test it with the message and try another one and just see what the response rate

77
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,880
is.

78
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:33,160
Now it's worth noting that once you actually have these on your site and you've completely changed most

79
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,990
of them there they are virtually indistinguishable from templates.

80
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:44,140
Now the only downside right was that you can't change every single part of it but to the naked user

81
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,400
they have no idea that this site is a template.

82
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,240
Once you've changed everything out of it so don't worry about people thinking that it's going to look

83
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,050
generic or mechanical or what have you.

84
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,390
So the last thing I want to point out is I'm going to do this over here in the resource section.

85
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,080
This is just someone who went ahead and actually curated some of the best design studio Web site templates

86
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,090
and some of these are actually free which is quite helpful if you guys are for some reason just absolutely

87
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,970
stuck with regards to which one you think looks better.

88
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,040
Try to dwell a little bit more on what exactly you want to convey.

89
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,110
Go back to the previous lectures where we did some of that planning that will definitely help you.

90
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,730
You can always post in the group discussion.

91
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:30,320
We can talk about it but you can also just go and resort to Google and just look for highly rated templates

92
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,810
and just see whether or not that's something that other people already like which is helpful because

93
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:41,780
if someone has already said this design template is very nice then you know that it already has a positive

94
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,540
effect on people looking for it.

95
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:50,150
So the last thing I want to point out very very quickly is a service that is incredibly helpful for

96
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,500
changing this.

97
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:58,760
So a lot of times when you are updating a template and there is just something that is beyond your skill

98
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,120
set but it's something that's very simple to do.

99
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,780
Let's say you wanted to take an image and customize it for you.

100
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:11,120
You want it to take your logo insert it or change something in the image and say you know there's a

101
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:19,370
stock image of say EMAC and you would like to change the iMac to have an image of your website or something

102
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,920
of your portfolio but you don't have the photoshop skills or whatever to do that what you can do is

103
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,960
you can use.

104
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,410
And I love using the 9 designs dot com if you guys are already familiar with my other courses we cover

105
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:38,780
99 designs quite a bit and tasks and what you basically do is you pay $20 and anything that a graphic

106
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,410
designer can do in an hour will be done in an hour and sent back to you.

107
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:48,570
So like anything else out there you just give a very basic description of what it is.

108
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:54,230
Over here you would upload your template or link to it up here and then you would say this is exactly

109
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,680
what I want it to change.

110
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,350
This is the image I have I want it to look like this.

111
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:05,660
What you can also do is say there is an icon set in my template and I want to change it to do to look

112
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,420
like this or customize it to look like this.

113
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,570
And you can use this and for $20 you can fix you know 10 different icons because it's something that

114
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,590
a graphic designer could do very very quickly.

115
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,820
So use this whenever you're absolutely stuck.

116
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,550
Most of these templates give you a modest amount of the ability to change everything on it.

117
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,690
Sometimes you get stuck with regards to oh I want to customize an image swap on an image but I want

118
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,770
it to look professional.

119
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,860
But you just simply don't have the time or the skills to do it.

120
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,240
This is typically what I use so whenever I'm using a template or we're using a template for a client

121
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:48,050
we'll put it up and then we can actually if we need to rapidly outsource something we use this quite

122
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,420
often actually and they're almost guaranteed to return this in an hour on average usually comes back

123
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,060
for us 20 25 minutes.

124
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,590
OK guys so go to these Web sites.

125
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,650
They're fantastic just for browsing around and getting some inspiration find something that you like.

126
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,490
Try not to be overwhelmed by how many templates there are out there.

127
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,690
If you're really having trouble with it.

128
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,240
Like I said before go back look at the value proposition lectures where we talked about deciding what

129
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,370
your strategy is what you're going to be good at what exactly you're going to sell and then try to build

130
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,820
something around that.

131
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,380
And that will help you considerably when you then go and pick something that will at least help you

132
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,150
whittle it down quite a bit.

133
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:40,940
OK guys if you have any questions just post in the group discussion otherwise I'll see in the next lecture.
