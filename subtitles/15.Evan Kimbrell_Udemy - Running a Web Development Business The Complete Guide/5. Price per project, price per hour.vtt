00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.220
You guys will come back to the course in this lecture and just go talk real quickly about how do development

2
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.790
firms get paid.

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.840
So if you've ever contracted out with a development firm or with a freelancer this might be completely

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.680
new to you.

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.640
So there are two primary ways of development firm and also development.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.350
Freelancers get paid.

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.880
One is price per hour and two is price per project.

8
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:38.490
Now there are other ones out there and a lot of times we end up working for things like d rates or hybrid

9
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.630
rates.

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.560
Those are kind of abnormal and that's not something that you're normally going to run into and it's

11
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.910
really not something that you're going to really worry about probably in your first year of running

12
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.330
a web development business.

13
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.160
So price per hour is exactly what you think it is.

14
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.890
It's when you charge per hour of labor you put into the project.

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.950
Another way of calling this is time and materials.

16
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:07.630
So instead of say estimating the project is going to just take this amount of money what you typically

17
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.390
end up doing is give a projection of how many hours it takes and then you'll just work on the project

18
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.980
and bill afterwards.

19
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.700
Now in a lot of cases really well-known well-established firms they charge time and materials and not

20
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.250
even give an estimation.

21
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.230
All they do is say this is our per hour rate.

22
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.090
And then if you engage us for this entire project and really only worry about is building after the

23
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.610
fact.

24
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.090
So after they spent 100 hours or 50 hours I'll send you a bill and then they typically will use something

25
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.520
like 15 or 30 to get paid.

26
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.880
Now the other one is price per project and basically what that means is that you take a chunk of work

27
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.680
or a task and you give an estimate for the entirety of that task.

28
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.190
So that is regardless of whether or not that task takes you 10 hours or 100 hours or 200 hours you're

29
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.000
going to make an estimation at the beginning you're in a state of crisis the client's going to agree

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.950
with you and then you work on it and then you get paid based off of whatever agreement you have for

31
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.380
when you get paid maybe you get paid up front maybe get paid at the end maybe split out over milestones.

32
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.950
So now there are obvious pros and cons for both of them as a development firm you're almost always going

33
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.300
to want to work on time and materials.

34
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.950
And the reason why that is is because one of the biggest headaches of running a development firm is

35
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.230
that your estimations are not always correct and it's almost impossible to get an estimation that's

36
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.070
accurate every single time.

37
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.790
Why are estimations hard to predict.

38
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.770
Well because a lot of times you just don't know everything that goes into a project and it's impossible

39
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.110
without spending an enormous amount of time upfront to figure out how complex each individual issue

40
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.780
that's included in a project is a lot of time you look at something and say oh we can do that 10 hours

41
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.970
once you actually get it do it research it try to actually do it you run into a bug and it ends up taking

42
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.960
30 hours.

43
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.410
This happens to quite literally every developer in the world every development firm in the world has

44
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.540
trouble estimating up for either time and material agreement.

45
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.420
The communication between you and the client it's so much easier.

46
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.580
All you have to say is this is how long it took me and that's really it because you've agreed to just

47
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.190
pay for your time and ultimately that's what every single freelancer or development for what they want

48
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.740
to be paid for their time.

49
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.330
So obviously the cons of setting up a time and materials way of getting paid or that it's harder to

50
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.280
be competitive with time and materials you can't really beat against other people you almost always

51
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.230
have a per hour rate.

52
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.260
And it's hard to change that per hour rate and then have them kind of believe you when you say all of

53
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.300
a sudden this developer is only worth $30 an hour as opposed to before when he said he's worth $50 an

54
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.960
hour.

55
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.990
The biggest condo is actually on the client side.

56
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.770
Clients don't generally like time and materials because they like to be able to budget upfront.

57
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.400
They like to know exactly what this is going to cost and they also like to know that if anything goes

58
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.890
wrong it falls on you that development to figure it out and keep it within budget.

59
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.000
There's also this kind of general anxiety about what happens if my project really gets away from us.

60
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.340
What happens if this project.

61
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.300
You said Oh I think it will be a hundred hours ends up being a thousand that could break an organizations

62
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.010
budget and a lot of them really aren't there every single day so they might not notice when it's about

63
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.490
to go outside of their budget constraints.

64
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.050
So on the flip side you can do price per project.

65
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.240
It's obviously a problem for you with the development firm because you're going to have to bid upfront

66
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.190
for exactly what you think it is.

67
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.130
You know if you're smart about it you can hedge and say this is what I think it'll be done with more

68
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.500
research and more information it might change.

69
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.280
You can say things like you know this is the range that I think it will be.

70
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.060
Once I actually spend more time on it than I can get more specific.

71
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.590
One of the biggest problems I think for development firms is that if you're giving out price per project

72
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.170
as you can spend a lot of time estimating that out right at the very beginning.

73
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.430
You know if you're doing five estimations each one could take you two or three hours.

74
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.100
You just sucked up two days of someone's time you end up spending 15 hours of time estimating and you

75
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.530
don't even know which ones are going to win.

76
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.370
So regardless you're going to end up wasting time and that is not what you want to do at all.

77
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.650
Now the obvious advantage to a project prize for you the development firm is that you can be more competitive

78
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.280
about it.

79
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.580
You can lower your price to beat out other people if you know your specialty or you're better at building

80
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.540
something in someone else's and you're got an inherent advantage when you give them a project cost.

81
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.220
You can just you know if you know it's going to take you half the time with someone else to do it because

82
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.800
you have expertise you have a right to use codebase before you have a project you can use pieces from

83
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.760
then you can outbid that person pretty effectively.

84
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.410
And you yourself still stay in budget now like I said before there are other ways of doing this.

85
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.230
Here it spread.

86
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.720
We use an agile methodology and we'll cover that later in the course whether or not you should use Adjt.

87
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.970
out.

88
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.480
What does that mean and how does that work for billing.

89
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.380
But basically what we say is we give an estimate of how many hours each chunk of work is going to cost

90
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.070
and then we have a price per chunk of work.

91
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.240
So really it's kind of like a hybrid.

92
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.210
We're really kind of bidding per hour but that giving you an hourly estimate and then typically what

93
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.160
we do is we say you know here's an hourly asset for this section and we'll cover it if it goes above

94
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.850
this amount.

95
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.600
So keep in mind though also that when you start you're probably going to have to use price per project

96
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:42.860
that is usually the pricing scheme and any development or for more freelance or use is when they're

97
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.140
first starting out when you don't have this ready to use client base that keeps coming back and back

98
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.350
for more work.

99
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:55.190
You can't be as picky so you kind of have to give them what they want especially a lot of times if you're

100
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.870
working with a client that's never worked with you before they're probably going to expect a price per

101
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:06.890
project estimate unless of course that came from a really warm referral or something like that in which

102
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:12.880
case they might be willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and using a price per hour so big as

103
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.180
takeaways here is that when you start please expect that you going to be doing probably a little mixture

104
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.630
of both.

105
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.320
If you're lucky you'll do price per hour or time and materials as we call it.

106
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:28.160
But it realistically you're going to be doing a lot of price per project estimations and that's really

107
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:35.810
what you're going to have to use to leverage your costs and your time to get the best price to get the

108
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.900
best projects.

109
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:42.200
Over time this will get much much more Koshy you'll start using more and more time in materials and

110
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.850
all of a sudden a lot of your headaches associated with Project Management and Budget Management will

111
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.820
pretty much go away.

112
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:59.190
OK guys we'll see you in the next section.
