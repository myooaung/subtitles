1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,690
You can bring up user interface for what that looks like.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,120
So in an actual job so this is a job that I built to an application that I'd built previously and you

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,600
can kind of see what it looks like after you've selected someone.

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,820
I use the programmer name Nicholas.

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,970
It puts me in a work room with them and there I can see messages.

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,140
I can see my payments and they use an escrow service.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,940
It's very easy to use.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,460
You know you just fund an amount and then you use it like you'll use it like a milestone.

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,520
So you'll say you know five hundred bucks to get this done and five hundred bucks to get this done and

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,920
a thousand dollars to get this done.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,340
And as they finish it and deliver it then you can release it to them.

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,840
Elance holds onto the money like an escrow so that you can dispute it if anything happens so they don't

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,830
deliver it or they deliver something that you didn't ask for.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,800
Here is an area where again oh here's this.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,820
This is the tracker.

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,730
So if I wanted to I could ask them to use the freelancer tracker.

17
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,300
I didn't because I use a project price and I trusted this freelancer I had worked with them before.

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,070
But if you wanted to you could use this and this is a way of keeping them honest when they're talking

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,470
about charging you per hour but also seeing how productive they are if you're doing manual like virtual

20
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,440
assistant task or someone's filling out a Excel sheet or something like that.

21
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,350
That could be quite useful.

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,340
Being able to make sure that they work for eight hours they are actually working for eight hours and

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,950
they're not working for 10 15 minutes of that hour.

24
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,980
They also give you the ability to upload your contract onto here.

25
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:44,400
L.A. is pretty good at looking at the contracts that you use and then going off of that information

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,850
when it comes to a dispute.

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,490
So it's not just to prove that you have some legality behind this.

28
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:56,300
Lance does use the contract language you use to enforce whatever is happening in your project.

29
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,930
Let's see now I think that honestly covers pretty much everything you would want to know about Lance.

30
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,970
Again it's something that I enjoy quite a bit.

31
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,200
I like using it.

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,000
I've gotten some really good really talented people off of here.

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,510
It is usually my go to unless I'm trying to cut costs from trying to cut costs.

34
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,010
Then why would go to freelancer.

35
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,530
And that's coming up.

36
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,650
And if I wanted to have someone who wants to work per hour because they don't know how big the project

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,930
is or I want to have a relationship with someone that goes on forever I would use oDesk and so Odessey

38
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:42,360
is going to be next.
