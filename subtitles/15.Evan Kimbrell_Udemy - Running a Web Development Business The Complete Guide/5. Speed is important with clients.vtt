00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.970
You guys come back to the course.

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.330
So in this lecture we're going to talk about speed and how important that is to your client relationship.

3
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.230
Now when I talk about speed I'm not actually talking about time line.

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.900
That's kind of obvious right.

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.600
You don't want to take years to get something done.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.720
When I talk about speed I'm actually talking about responsiveness speed meaning from the point at which

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.400
they contact you how long does it take you to respond and what are you in the habit of doing with regard

8
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.510
to the response time.

9
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.990
Now if you didn't obviously know this before responsiveness is very important not only to closing deals

10
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.490
but keeping your client happy a client that receives prompt responses is much less likely to be anxious

11
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.780
or upset about things along the road.

12
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.130
What are the bigger mistakes you see.

13
00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.570
A lot of times with development businesses is that people are really on the ball when they're trying

14
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.840
to close a client and as soon as they close a client they kind of relax they kind of allow large windows

15
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.180
of time to pass before they respond.

16
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.780
They often think that's a strategy for setting the tone which is something that we talked about in a

17
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.530
previous lecture but that's not actually the case.

18
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.770
We're not actually setting the tone you're changing the tone in general if you're responsive that helps

19
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950
you in many many different ways.

20
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.440
A lot of times you have clients that blow up and they're not blowing up for any specific reason.

21
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.620
It's a cumulative effect because they feel as if their needs are not being met.

22
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.370
Now at the risk of sounding redundant I want to reemphasize a point I had made previously in the course.

23
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.550
Clients are anxious creatures.

24
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.280
They are a species that is constantly nervous about everything.

25
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.590
The reason why this is is because they generally fall under three categories small business owners entrepreneurs

26
00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.810
which are often the same thing or account managers or people who are in charge of procurement at large

27
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.600
companies.

28
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.600
In all three of those scenarios they do not have money that they can lose.

29
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.250
One might lose a job another might lose a business and another might lose their business and their reputation.

30
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.350
So regardless of how healthy the project is they always want to feel as if you are constantly there.

31
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.670
The idea and the feeling that if they have a problem and it's going to take a long time to hear anything

32
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.920
back from you that's a bad thing.

33
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.510
That gives him a lot of time to worry and a lot of time to make a lot of false assumptions.

34
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.300
Now invariably if you have a slow response time that is almost always going to be read from the client

35
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.300
side as something terrible is happening.

36
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.150
You know the ship is sinking.

37
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.960
There's obviously something wrong that the other person is hiding from me.

38
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.640
Even in the best scenario they're going to assume that maybe the project is going fine.

39
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.710
They're just going assume that you don't know the answer to what they told you.

40
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.640
They might assume that you are not as integrated in their project or as knowledgeable as their project.

41
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.430
As you said you are either way that a Rhodes trust it erodes your ability to project yourself as authority

42
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.850
and it creates a very problematic relationship.

43
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.520
So get used to responding as quickly as possible.

44
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.900
The best way of getting around this is you know if someone asks you a dense question that requires a

45
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.800
response and requires research and requires collaboration with your other contractors or other employees

46
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.010
don't feel as if you have to answer that question now.

47
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.010
You don't to stop at dinner and go out there and research the question and send them a five point answer

48
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.830
what you need to simply do is let them know you are there and let them know that you aware that they

49
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.760
need that information.

50
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.520
That is it.

51
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.310
You can literally just respond give them your first impression of the answer and say but I'm going to

52
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.430
respond with a much more comprehensive and a much more correct answer and then give them a timeline.

53
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.210
That's the easiest way of doing it.

54
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.660
Just let them know hey I'm here I've heard you.

55
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.540
I'm going to respond and then you can go on being as unresponsive as you want.

56
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.340
It doesn't actually change really anything.

57
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.820
Get used to tying yourself to your phone.

58
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.960
If that's not something you're used to it is something that's going to help you immensely when it comes

59
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.230
to managing clients.

60
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.030
Check your phone often.

61
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:25.110
You don't necessarily have to send text messages yourself or have pop up notifications but set your

62
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.260
mail application so that it automatically checks your mail often for you.

63
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.610
Maybe even set keywords in case clients e-mail you.

64
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.250
You do get a notification if you're going away for a certain period of time let them know ahead of time

65
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.770
and if you don't do that or you don't feel as if it's necessary at the absolute minimum set an auto

66
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.010
responder set the little message that gets sent and says you're out of the office you're unavailable.

67
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.860
Just so they know this is not me being irresponsible.

68
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.050
This is not me hiding a horrible fire we've made in the kitchen.

69
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.620
This is me being gone.

70
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.650
I can't help it.

71
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.910
Now it's OK to lag during certain times that you've previously established you're unavailable.

72
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.030
Typically for me I don't obviously respond on Saturdays and Sundays as quickly as I would on week days

73
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.690
and I've actually gotten in the habit of setting the tone that way in that if you send me a message

74
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.690
on Friday night you're not going to hear anything until Monday morning.

75
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.150
That is perfectly acceptable.

76
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.320
That's reasonable.

77
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.660
But the point here is to be consistent.

78
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.000
You can't respond on Saturdays for a year and in year two you decide you're not going to set.

79
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.700
You're not going to apply on Saturdays.

80
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.960
People get used to their their basic expectations.

81
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.750
People get used to the way you treat them.

82
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.330
They're going expect that in the future.

83
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.330
So that's basically it.

84
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.770
It's a very powerful communication technique.

85
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.070
It's a very powerful messaging technique if they message you just let them know you acknowledge it give

86
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.440
them some impression of what's going on.

87
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.000
Tell them you'll get back to them.

88
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.490
Then go along and be as flaky as you want to be.

89
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.700
Take as long as you planned on taking anyway just let them know you are there and give them a timeline.

90
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.500
Again it all kind of relates to being confident and telling them you know I'm aware this is happening

91
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.490
and this is my timeline for getting you an answer.

92
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.050
That's all they need to settle their anxiety any questions posed in the group discussion.

93
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:25.200
Otherwise in the next lecture.
