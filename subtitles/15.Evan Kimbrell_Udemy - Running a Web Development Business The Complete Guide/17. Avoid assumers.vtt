00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.400
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.110
So in this lecture we're going to talk about the worst possible potential client you could ever find

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.410
and there's someone that you need to avoid like the plague.

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.460
There are the people we call the assumer.

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.100
Now one of the biggest problems in development in general is it your to be talking with people who are

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.450
not used to the level of specificity that's required to run a successful development project as a result

7
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.960
of that.

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.430
A lot of them think it's OK for them to speak in very vague terms and to make generalized comparisons

9
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.710
that are very unspecific and very unhelpful.

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.240
Now this is something you're going to see all the time.

11
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.490
People use imprecise language to describe something to you.

12
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.170
Your job is going to be able to help them take that information and break it down into something that's

13
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.380
actually specific and precise and actually describes a real application.

14
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.230
Now assumer is are the people that speak in vague terms have an idea in their head or an image in their

15
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.910
head and they just assume you know what they mean.

16
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.620
That's why we call them assumer is not assumer might say I want you to build this piece or this feature

17
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.910
like this and I'll refer to another Web site.

18
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.960
And then when you build it and you build it the way that you see it working the same they'll say no

19
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.560
I thought you understood that it also meant this and this and this.

20
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.680
These are the types of people that we use really vague comparisons will say like Facebook or like this

21
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.320
feature but you don't know what piece of that feature or what piece of Facebook that gigantic platform

22
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.370
they're talking about.

23
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.330
Assumer is use things like loaded sentences though.

24
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.880
Describe something to you that sounds really simple but there's a lot of things hidden underneath the

25
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.330
sentence that when you actually go to develop it you really could struggle.

26
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:03.660
Now give you an example in assumer might say on my application clicking this button sends an invitation

27
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.470
to their friends about the application.

28
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.860
You build it exactly that way.

29
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.220
They press a button sends it to their friend and then you know it just says Click here to sign up.

30
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.140
Then when you deliver it to them they say no no no it's actually supposed to click this button opened

31
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.410
up your contact list.

32
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.900
Pick someone from the contact list and then send them of pre-formatted e-mail.

33
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.420
That also includes multiple other options.

34
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.990
That's what an assumer does.

35
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.050
They just assume that since they have no experience working in development or working with contracted

36
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.970
work that if they just say it does this they just assume you think the same thing they think in general.

37
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.180
Just look for people who use overly vague language.

38
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.520
If you do see that kind of think of it like a big rock that you need to break it down and get them to

39
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.940
agree to the individual pieces they say share is an invitation you need to say what happens when I click

40
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.560
the button.

41
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.820
Does it change information doesn't pop up does it text message them or does it e-mail them in the e-mail.

42
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.430
What does it need to say in the e-mail.

43
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.190
Are there any graphics you just need to get every little bit of actual specifics out of them and then

44
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.960
you can at least agree on something.

45
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.890
The biggest mistake you can make is just to agree to something vague.

46
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.800
I've seen people who work for development firms or freelancers who agreed to build multiple hundreds

47
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.810
of hours on a project for something that was described in a paragraph.

48
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.480
That's crazy.

49
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.410
I've seen people take projects where the description was Camera app that allows you to take photos like

50
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.760
Instagram.

51
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.800
What in the world does that mean.

52
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.390
There are so many things in Instagram and so many things going on in their camera section of their app

53
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.980
that.

54
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.450
How do you know what exactly to include and what not to include and how do you know what part of it

55
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.390
to customize and what not.

56
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.950
You need specificity.

57
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.790
So try to avoid the dreaded assumer as much as possible.

58
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.330
These are the people that are really gung ho about the projects but everything they tell you is really

59
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.230
vague and they pack tons and tons of features and functions into every single sentence and they probably

60
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.980
don't even realize that these people are generally just lazy and pretty much they're all over the place

61
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.720
so be careful.

62
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.020
Try to break down what they're saying into individual estimates.

63
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.740
Get them to agree on it and try not to accept work unless it's very specific and it has at least a medium

64
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.730
amount of basic kind of documentation or instructions.

65
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.580
OK guys try to avoid these guys seriously.

66
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.450
They're the biggest headache you'll ever have.

67
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.470
It's purely based out of inexperience that it's purely based out of them never having done this before

68
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.960
specifically with development contract firms.

69
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.260
Guys any questions posed in the group discussion otherwise.

70
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.780
See you next lecture.
