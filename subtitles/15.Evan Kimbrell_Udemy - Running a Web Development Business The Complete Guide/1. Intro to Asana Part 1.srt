00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,500
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to go over a sauna.

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:16,740
A sauna is a free and very very very popular project management tool that a lot of startups use.

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,740
I believe it was started by the co-founder of Facebook.

4
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,770
It's very light.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,040
It's very easy it works on every single device you have.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,030
Now we're going to cover how to get acquainted with it which features and kind of aspects of it.

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,250
Should you be familiarized with.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,460
And then in the next lecture when I go over how you can use this for your actual situation and for your

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,700
actual contractor kind of scenario.

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,960
Now asana is great for a lot of different things.

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,060
It's Personally my favorite project management tool and it's what we use here at Sprint.

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,250
OK so without further ado let's get into a sauna.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,250
Start messing around start getting used to it and then we'll start talking about how you can make this

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,690
work for you and your project and how you can make it dramatically increase the efficiency of your project.

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,520
So let's go to the screencast.

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:05,860
All right.

17
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,760
So let's get acquainted with a sauna now.

18
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:16,640
So the way that a sauna works is it kind of looks like any type of web Administration panel that you've

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,190
ever kind of logged into.

20
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,650
Looks kind of like Wordpress when you log into it.

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,560
It's essentially a system of task lists.

22
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,660
You can see right here this is literally the first page you'll see once you create an account it all

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,220
uses lists to put everything together.

24
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,180
That's a little bit different than base camp and it's a little bit different than the other popular

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,030
project management tools and it's one of the reasons why we like a sauna so much because it allows you

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,570
to list anything you're doing quite literally anything in a linear fashion.

27
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,230
And make sure that you can itemize out every single thing and then move through them.

28
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,220
So if you're not familiar with a sauna literally you just go to a sauna.

29
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,500
Dot com.

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,420
Go and create an account.

31
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,460
It's quite literally only two screens and this is the first screen you will see.

32
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,480
Ours is a little bit different because it has some projects in it and it has some data that I've already

33
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,640
inserted before have multiple counts.

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,930
But you also look essentially like this.

35
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:25,610
So the way that this works is right here on the left hand side we have all the different sections of

36
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:25,990
the song.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,830
So my tasks are all the tasks that are assigned to you.

38
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:37,100
Things that you are involved in your Diasporan is the area where you can get project based summaries

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,640
and then these other sections right here just show all of the items that exist within their project

40
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,170
management tool.

41
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,600
Now the simplest way of using a sauna is to simply just create a project and you create a project is

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,430
down here so you go down to projects that plus and we can call this whatever you want.

43
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,710
Read then you can choose privacy.

44
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:06,420
So the way that this works is I can say it's open to sprint kicks so I said this anyone in our company

45
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,640
could see this so this would go to the master kind of a sauna and if I said this to private that wouldn't

46
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,730
mean that I have to invite every single person to the project to see it so I could have people who are

47
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,400
in this Assata looking at some of the other projects but not able to view this project.

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,150
So you would pick private if you use the sauna for multiple projects so say you had some project that

49
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,420
was completely unrelated to the other one and you're keeping track of it in Asuna.

50
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,740
A lot of times also people use this as a personal productivity tool.

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,760
They list out all the tasks they need to get done today or this week or this month and they use that

52
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:49,380
and so you obviously wouldn't want to share that with a contractor or someone you're outsourcing with.

53
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,180
So if that was the case you'd want to pick private.

54
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,480
Now if you have multiple projects where the people that you're working with they're going to bring into

55
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:02,730
this work across different projects which happens quite frequently especially when you find someone

56
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,100
that you really enjoy working with and they have multiple skill sets which most developers or designers

57
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:14,280
do in that case you can actually add them to multiple projects and if you set this to open they can

58
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,050
actually jump across and see what's available in the other ones just for the purposes of this.

59
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,050
I'm going to show you what it looks like when you can open project.

60
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:29,190
And here we can put a description descriptions are helpful for you to remember what exactly this project

61
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,720
is about or to give a snapshot because a lot of times you'll have lots and lots of projects so it's

62
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,310
very helpful.

63
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,310
Keep it simple.

64
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:46,810
All right so right here off about this is our project and it looks kind of like a legal pad almost as

65
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,690
you can see it's quite literally just a vertical view of what is essentially a task list.

66
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,850
Now the core of Ossana is you can literally just add a task.

67
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:04,700
So I wanted to add a task I would just click and I would add a task I could say you know create first

68
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,320
you know application you know depending on what you're using you could do this in any way you want.

69
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,660
That's how you are a task if you want to add another task you simply just hit enter and you can move

70
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,240
all the way down.

71
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,420
Now within each individual task there's a lot of different things you can do.

72
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,200
So right here you have the check box and that just means you market complete.

73
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,590
Now if I click this it's going to say that it's complete it's going to disappear.

74
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:36,970
You can see the completed task by going to view tasks to do and then you can go to a recently completed

75
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,590
tasks and I'll show up on today.

76
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,550
Now it can also you can also select yesterday.

77
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:48,010
You can also select one two and three weeks it'll show up in these three and this one but not yesterday.

78
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:53,020
Now the reason why this is helpful is because as you are running a project and you have multiple people

79
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,780
contributing to the project multiple people adding tasks removing task etc. it's really helpful to see

80
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,120
you know when you log in first thing in the day what happened yesterday what got finished what do I

81
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,350
need to check.

82
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:11,590
So what you typically will do is when you create a project you go off and list all of the main overview

83
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,670
points of what you need to get done.

84
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:20,000
This would be a theoretical project so we could say you know build first screen because they build a

85
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,590
screen and you know you could say second screen

86
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,710
so literally you can put whatever you think you need in your project.

87
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,680
This design project could be really anything.

88
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,350
I mean you're going to use this for brainstorming.

89
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,950
You can put ideas down now after you've created a task there's again several things you can do.

90
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,070
You can check it as done.

91
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,100
You can also assign this task to someone.

92
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,490
Now the way that you do this is you simply just click it and you can put in the email or the name of

93
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,660
the person you're signing into.

94
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:03,620
Now when you do that any person who has been assigned to Task has that show up in their mind task section

95
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,410
it also automatically keeps them in.

96
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,810
To get push notifications if they have this on an app it also gives them email notifications and gives

97
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,990
them tax notifications as do dates are coming or as they're assigned a task or as a task they're assigned

98
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,610
is finished.

99
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,170
So it's going to keep all of the relevant parties in each task notified.

100
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,770
Now the easiest way to add someone to your screen.

101
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,870
The easiest way to add one to a project is quite simply to go over here and say invite people here you

102
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:39,690
just put in the email address of whoever you are in a work with say its freelancer freelance dot com

103
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,760
and I would invite and that would send them an invitation for them to sign up and get into this project

104
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,080
page or they can now see everything.

105
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,130
So it's very very easy to on board someone.

106
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:59,780
And that's why I also suggest using Assata to manage your projects because it's very easy to get a contractor

107
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,960
or an outsourced freelancer into this.

108
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,280
Now convincing someone to use a project management tool might have some resistance up front you might

109
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,870
have some developers or designers be resistant to the idea.

110
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:21,830
And the reason why they might be resistant to using a project management tool like this is because for

111
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,900
one a lot of them have their own processes by which they create their own projects.

112
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,820
Now the reason is a lot of them don't want to feel like they're being monitored and feel like they have

113
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:38,250
to and feel as if the person they're working with can see their progress on a day to day basis.

114
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,330
And here's the thing.

115
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,300
You know there is some truth to that as a freelancer freelancers you get very comfortable in the way

116
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,400
that they work.

117
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:51,200
I personally always like using this with all of our contractors or outsource teams.

118
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,880
And the reason why is because it's a great way of testing to see whether or not they're good freelancer

119
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,850
or contractor if they really don't want to use an online project management tool that it's a chance

120
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,110
that this is probably not a good person to work with.

121
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,340
You really want to work with people who are adaptable and people who are open to change.

122
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,710
You want to work with people who value things like transparency and value things like being able to

123
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,600
communicate effectively.

124
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:25,040
Now if they insist on using say like an E L'anse page or using e-mail to monitor your project progress

125
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:32,690
they're basically saying I prefer to keep you in the dark and they think that the hassle of updating

126
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,970
you more often.

127
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:41,360
And it's very easy to use an intuitive way is more valuable than actually being able to tell what's

128
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,710
going on in the project and for you to know whether or not your money is being spent correctly.

129
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,650
So I like it because you can quite literally just add an email and invite them all that means is that

130
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:57,590
you need to have their email address so if you've hired someone off up work you hired someone off of

131
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,850
really anywhere.

132
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,910
All you need is their email.

133
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,220
You can add them and they're in.

134
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,860
And now all of a sudden we can start adding tasks assigning it to that person and then we can start

135
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,960
working and see now that I've added someone right here it's going to wait till they confirm and once

136
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,240
they confirm and sign up then all of a sudden they'll have more functionality.

137
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:22,430
Usually the color of their icon changes but I can still assign them tasks so I could say this one is

138
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:28,150
now assigned to you and you can see now that this freelancer freelancer is assigned to this task.

139
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,680
OK so now on the right side of the pain this is where we get the drill down on each individual task

140
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,820
on the individual task what we can do is we can change the project it's and we can add a description

141
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,810
of each individual task.

142
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,850
This is where you know we can take a high level description and then get into the details.

143
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,560
But most importantly now you have a thread where you can have a thread and describe what's happening

144
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,810
with this task What exactly do you mean.

145
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,320
Do your requirements change.

146
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,690
Do you have more information at the other person can also respond with where they are in the process.

147
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,470
They correspond with questions directly to this task and you can answer this an efficient way and as

148
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,910
long as you're added to this task you will get notified every time that happens.

149
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:17,480
Now imagine doing that e-mail if you told them I would install this widget in my Wordpress and you didn't

150
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,940
give them all of the information they would need.

151
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,830
Or maybe they go in there and something's different something in the Wordpress code is changing the

152
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,810
widget has changed its documentation.

153
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,410
The is different.

154
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,500
And also there are other things that are happening in the project or they just send you one big bulk

155
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,330
e-mail to send one big project update and Elance or up work or freelancer.

156
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,870
This is very inefficient.

157
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,780
It's very inefficient in terms of organization in terms of speed.

158
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,760
In this case as they're quite literally responding to something I can get the information from them

159
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,910
and I can respond specifically to that task.

160
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,470
That is one of the bigger problems with project management especially around web and mobile projects.

161
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,610
You don't always know exactly what a developer or designer is talking about.

162
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,150
And this allows you to literally drill down on whatever it is.

163
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,740
And typically when you build tasks they're going to be much much more specific than this.

164
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:23,200
But I'm going to show you how you can make this a little bit more sensical in just a second.
