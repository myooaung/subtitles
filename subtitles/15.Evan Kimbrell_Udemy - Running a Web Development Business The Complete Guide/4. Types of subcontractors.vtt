00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.870
You guys will come back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about your subcontracting

2
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.390
strategy and we're going to talk a little bit about what's the best path for you.

3
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.170
So if you're already taking this course you are either a programmer who's interested in growing your

4
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.790
skills growing your efforts and taking your work to the next level or you're a non-programmer and you're

5
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.890
probably looking at this like it's a business.

6
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.630
You think you could do really well in.

7
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.340
Now while introduce it like that.

8
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.490
There's only two buckets that you can fall into.

9
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.080
Well because in both cases you're going to need some type of subcontractor strategy.

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.600
Now if you're a programmer you can't really clone yourself and the whole idea behind turning this into

11
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.040
a business is that you're going to take larger projects or more projects.

12
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.360
And if you're a non-programmer Well this is pretty obvious you can't make the Web site yourself.

13
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.570
So you're going to have to find someone who can.

14
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.600
Now if you're someone who's coming at this from the angle of I'm a freelancer and I just want to learn

15
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.550
techniques to grow my established business that's perfectly fine too.

16
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.800
You don't necessarily need a subcontracting strategy but it is extremely helpful to understand how you're

17
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.740
going to go about it and to have basic skills in subcontracting so if anything comes up you still know

18
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.540
how to find help.

19
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.840
So before you start your journey of putting together a killer team and finally signing your first multimillion

20
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.330
dollar contract you need to set down and have a little bit of a think about what you're subcontracting

21
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.360
strategy is going to be.

22
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.260
So let me give you a little bit of transparency about how freelancers and contractors are typically

23
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.990
divided up.

24
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.140
Now it's really helpful before you go and look for a subcontractor to know what you're going to expect

25
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.420
and to know exactly what you're looking for.

26
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.260
Now first off you're going to need to make a decision about price and language.

27
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.810
Now the reason why I say those together is because they're almost always related to each other.

28
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.210
There are some exceptions of course.

29
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.390
Now some contractors are going to be from countries you've never heard of and some contractors they're

30
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.270
going to be from probably down the street.

31
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.670
There's a big gap when we're talking about distance now the same time some of them will be able to effectively

32
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.700
communicate and communicate fluidly and other ones are going to sound probably like drunk robots really

33
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.920
hard to understand sometimes they speak like you remember Max speak that old prop software program you

34
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.480
would use in elementary school.

35
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.510
Now a contractor with bad communication skills and an inconvenient time zone they're probably going

36
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.830
to be a lot cheaper.

37
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.690
Now obviously there's exceptions to this.

38
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.750
There are still expensive areas that have terrible language skills and terrible time zones.

39
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.160
But this is just a generalization.

40
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.930
Now a fluent English speaker who lives in the same exact time zone as you almost sometimes the same

41
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.370
city they're obviously going to be a lot more expensive.

42
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.740
Now how this relates to your business is that each type of contractor can dramatically change the dynamic

43
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.270
of how you deliver projects how you pitch your projects and how you find clients.

44
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.390
Now an expensive articulate contractor they're probably going to deliver much higher quality work but

45
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.480
they're also going to be considerably more expensive.

46
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.340
Now that for you means that you're going have to push higher prices to your clients and because your

47
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.650
rates are higher.

48
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.840
Now all of a sudden your clients are going to expect a considerably higher standard of project quality.

49
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.060
So in a lot of cases it can actually cancel itself out.

50
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.900
You charge more but the same time your clients ask for a lot more.

51
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.180
So in this scenario you might have to cut your margins especially at the very beginning.

52
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.610
So if you go this route.

53
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.750
The key here is going to be your ability to land higher paying contracts that are also probably longer

54
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.830
term or you need to plan on having a strategy of using higher paying contractors but also having access

55
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.010
to other experts that you can bring in to really put that top polish on your products.

56
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.520
Now a cheaper lower cost contractor with poor English skills.

57
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.770
That means that you're going to have to compensate upfront with more effort from your end.

58
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.860
And also you might have to deal with lower product quality but in this scenario your margins are always

59
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.180
going to be a lot healthier.

60
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.360
And that allows you the option to undercut other providers.

61
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.210
So the key to this scenario is if you pick a lower cost option someone who is not as great at communicating

62
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.930
or explaining what they're doing or what needs to be done.

63
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.170
The key here is going to be whether or not you can manage them effectively enough to get a good product

64
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.970
because if you can do that then you're price to quality ratio is going to be fantastic.

65
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.210
Now in the scenario of a more articulate more qualified contractor is more expensive you're not going

66
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.050
have to spend as much time with them which means that you can spend more time on other things.

67
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.850
Now a low cost contractor it's going to be the opposite.

68
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.420
You're going to spend more time on project management.

69
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.700
So which one you want to go with.

70
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.430
You want to focus more on sales and then just knowing that your project is more or less covered or you

71
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.960
want to spend more time on project management knowing that at the end of the day you make more money

72
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.830
per project.

73
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.540
Now here's the key distinction for me and this is what I always use when making this decision or consulting

74
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.910
someone on how to make this decision.

75
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.390
Think about yourself and think about your experience do you have a lot of experience working with contractors.

76
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.690
Do you have a lot of experience working with distributed teams.

77
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.220
Do you speak another language potentially.

78
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.800
Do you have any experience being a project manager.

79
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.520
How much experience do you have in web development and web development projects.

80
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.170
If you have a lot of experience and answered yes to a lot of the questions I just asked you then you're

81
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.430
a very good candidate for someone who can use the low cost high margin option.

82
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.430
Now is your underdeveloped in this kind of area.

83
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.430
Then it might make more sense for you to focus on higher paid contractors who can deal with more have

84
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.540
more autonomy and you focus more on sales.

85
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.720
So now one other division that you need to be aware of and you need to make a decision about is whether

86
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.950
or not you hire a freelancer or a firm an individual or a company.

87
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.900
Now if you're coming from my outsourcing course you know that we covered this like to death but for

88
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.410
this course I'm just going to simplify it.

89
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.470
So one firms come with what are called management layers.

90
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.850
This provides transparency and this provides accountability for your project.

91
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.470
It also offloads the work from you on to them when it comes to day to day management because of this

92
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.670
they're much less likely to disappear.

93
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.260
They're much less likely to run into problems and if they do get into problems they're more capable

94
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.400
of solving on their own before pulling you into the project.

95
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.150
Now on the flip side they come with a much higher price tag because you're not just paying for your

96
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.340
developer you're also paying for the project manager or whoever ends up managing them and also firms

97
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.630
always have a profit line.

98
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.170
Also keep in mind that firms are slower to move.

99
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.880
They have a lot more people in the organization.

100
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.230
They can't just drop everything and pick up whatever you need at this moment that you want it now.

101
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.360
Individuals are going to be considerably cheaper and considerably more flexible.

102
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.120
However you are the last line of defense in case anything goes wrong.

103
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.910
They get sick or any problem arises.

104
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.210
They're going to require a lot more management time from you.

105
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.780
So again when considering this division it really just comes down to experience.

106
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.800
Now if you're confident you can turn a low cost freelancer or a contractor into high quality work and

107
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.380
you know you have experience and you know you kind of have your stripes in this field then you definitely

108
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.730
can go for an outsourced freelancer.

109
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:32.270
Now if you're new to this and you want to focus a little bit more on the sales the branding the marketing

110
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.950
the promotion pretty much everything else that's involved in running a web development business then

111
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:43.370
you might want to choose higher paid more capable better communicating freelancers.

112
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.260
You also probably want to lean towards a firm because you will benefit the most from having that management

113
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.640
layer that we talked about.

114
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.570
You might want to also focus on someone who has similar time zones to you that's going to allow you

115
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:59.330
to communicate more effectively and not have this like in-between time where you can't communicate with

116
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.020
your contractor.

117
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.430
Now you don't always have to stay this way over time as you get more experience working with your web

118
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.740
projects you can transition into working with individuals and working with people who are in different

119
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.750
time zones in different countries and then you can kind of get the best of both worlds.

120
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.350
But at the beginning it's really helpful to know which one you should go for now.

121
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.620
And obviously there are in-between options.

122
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.100
You just need to understand that it's kind of like a spectrum right.

123
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.750
Certain people are better for using firm certain people are better for freelancers.

124
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.960
Certain people are better for outsourced labor and certain people are better for in in country near

125
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.100
the same time zone types of contractors.

126
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.890
Obviously the place where you create the most value for your client is when you're picking subcontractors

127
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.870
and you look for what other people call like the diamond in the rough.

128
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.780
And what that basically means is you look for and this is gets much easier as you have more experience.

129
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:53.810
You look for people where their price compared to their communication buildings compared to their capabilities.

130
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.390
Something's just off.

131
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.500
And so a lot of times you look for people who are undervalued.

132
00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.320
They're cheaper compared to how good they are or they're really good compared to how cheap they are

133
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.350
over time with enough experience.

134
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.940
You can start to mix and match and you can create whatever funky configuration you can at the beginning

135
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.630
though it's easier.

136
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.670
Think of it kind of in this one two solution.

137
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:21.530
All right guys I'll see you the next lecture.
