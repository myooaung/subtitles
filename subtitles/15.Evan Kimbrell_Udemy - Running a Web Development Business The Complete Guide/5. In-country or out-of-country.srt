1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:12,020
Well let's talk a little bit about how you can know when you should go outside the country.

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,010
Outsource your job or stay in your country.

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,760
I'm putting this up kind of as a bonus edition because a lot of you have been asking I'm not sure if

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,250
I'm ready to outsource or maybe I should stay in house.

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,880
And so I'm doing this kind of to give you a little bit of guidance what I think there's only two factors

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,890
that I think apply to picking outsource one.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,840
What are your resources at your disposal.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,490
HOW MUCH CASH DO YOU HAVE.

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,100
How much are you willing to allocate towards your project.

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,710
And then to what's your experience with this.

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,300
Have you outsource before.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,010
How technical are you.

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,450
You only know how to operate a Web browser.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,780
Then outsourcing might be a little bit harder for you.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,640
Do you know what a program is the programming language you know is that age TMLC.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,440
SS is that when you consider programming or do you actually know how to do some server side and you

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,660
done some code cademy or really anything if you write a book.

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,880
Those are two factors and they are inversely related.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,160
The more money you have and the more money you're willing to spend would imply that you can stay in

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,110
your country.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,700
You can and refer previously to the temp.

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,340
I said before about finding off hours developers you can use that trick to get someone who speaks your

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,020
language you can talk on the phone you can even call them because it's a local area code and you can

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,720
get them on the cheap.

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,080
They're still going to be more expensive than an outsourced firm but not significantly.

26
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,000
I mean not five times what you'd expect if you went to a traditional studio and one of the big cities

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,590
if you have less money to crack at this then I would say that you probably are going to lean towards

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,090
outsourcing.

29
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,150
They are the best bang for your buck and you just need to know in your head if you are spending less

30
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,710
money.

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,460
How are you going to make up for it if you answered equity slap yourself in the face.

32
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,090
You make up with effort effort was the correct answer.

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,090
That's what you need to do.

34
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,900
You need to put a little more sweat into it a little more effort into the details.

35
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,870
You need to watch the developer a little more closely.

36
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:18,050
You need to check in more often that's how you make up for having a lower budget to your familiarity.

37
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:24,970
Why does this matter if you are green if you are completely new to this whole technology thing it might

38
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,080
be a little bit difficult for outsourcing.

39
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,380
You're going to run into a lot of problems where you describe something that you wanted to do and they're

40
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:39,130
going to say we can't for whatever reason because of a language barrier or just a communication barrier

41
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,170
or an information barrier or you don't understand how technology works.

42
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:48,430
And so you that's going to create some issues I've had this many times where I have a developer who's

43
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,010
outsourced say they can't do something or they would prefer to do something else.

44
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,990
Back in the day I didn't know anything about technology and so I made the wrong decision.

45
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,980
Now I know a lot more about technology.

46
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,340
I understand where they're coming from and a lot of times I can predict those problems ahead of time

47
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,530
and a lot of times I can give them directions.

48
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,280
I can say no actually you can do it this way.

49
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,500
I've done it before.

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,690
It'll work just do it.

51
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,240
And then if you have experience maybe you were an I.T. director or maybe worked with developers before

52
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,530
you are used to communicating with them or you have some basic familiarity with how programming works

53
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,770
and how web applications in general work what's good standards for development what are bad standards

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,590
then you should be much more confident outsourcing then you can really reap the benefits of keeping

55
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,510
it cheap.

56
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,690
Using the price parity advantage price parity just yeah I was referring to is how in other countries

57
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,780
cost of living is lower.

58
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,090
Things are cheaper therefore they get paid less for the same amount of work.

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,970
You can really reach that price parity advantage so if you got a lot of money and little familiarity

60
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,440
with technology then you definitely have the luxury of staying in the country.

61
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:04,160
If it's the opposite have a lot of skill and it's an experience with with technology or at least project

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,990
management and you don't want to spend as much.

63
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,290
Then it's obvious you should go outsourcing.

64
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,200
If you're a mix between the two.

65
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,770
Honestly it's you you're just going to go with who you have the best relationship with whether it's

66
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:21,140
the person in your country outside of your country and refer back to the sections or we talked about

67
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:27,710
qualifying your freelancers or your studios and that's how you can kind of determine by and far which

68
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,510
direction you should go because it's going to depend on the individual person or the individual contracting

69
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:32,910
firm.
