00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,960
Hey guys I'm back to the core.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,980
So in this lecture we're going to talk about running without contracts.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:16,620
What happens in those scenarios where you didn't sign a contract but you're still making contract work

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,890
for one of your clients.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,870
Now this is the type of scenario that will eventually happen.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,800
A lot of you out there are going to try out your development business as an experiment and you might

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,050
not want to put a lot of time upfront into making contracts.

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,080
Now that's not a huge excuse if you're taking this course because we have contracts at the very end

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,320
of the course in the resources section that you can literally just plug and play your information.

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,020
And we don't have a lecture that explains how you get them signed electronically.

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,040
Really easy within 10 minutes.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,590
But for a variety of reasons it might be tempting not to sign a contract maybe the work that you're

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,100
doing is incredibly small and it's just not worth it.

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,370
Maybe it's someone that you've worked with in the past and so you feel like you trust them or maybe

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,550
it's like a friend and family type situation where you feel like a contract might be kind of a rude

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,410
thing to do.

17
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,270
And it signals that you don't trust them.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,530
It could also be the case that you are trying to close a client and you're worried that sending them

19
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,630
a contract might actually scare them away because it takes an extra step and a lot a little bit more

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,280
time.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,170
But it also makes them have to come to terms exactly what they're doing and paying for now running with

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,830
contracts.

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,540
It's never ideal.

24
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,610
I strongly suggest you don't do it.

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:33,130
I suggest you focus more time figuring out ways to make contracts easy and get them signed quickly.

26
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,490
That's a better time investment than trying to figure out how you can do damage control after you've

27
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,480
done an entire project that has no contract.

28
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,870
OK.

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,610
But if you do insist on going on this route.

30
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,130
I have three things that you should keep in mind that will help you quite a bit.

31
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,440
So number one don't ever do this with someone that you've never worked with before and not never was

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,600
someone who hasn't paid you before.

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,980
That's the key there.

34
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:01,020
A lot of times people think oh I've worked with this person before but in reality they've worked with

35
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,850
them collaborated but they've never changed money that's important.

36
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,930
An important distinction you can figure out pretty quickly how trustworthy someone is how credit worthy

37
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,740
they are by having a cash relationship with them.

38
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,410
Once you've established that you can pay each other and you see eye to eye on projects.

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,420
You know the chance of you having a miscommunication is significantly slimmer than if you're working

40
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,840
with someone that you've never traded money before with people's behavior around money is very very

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,250
different than the way that they behave around projects that don't involve money.

42
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,740
Number two keep a paper trail as much as possible.

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,780
And what I mean by this is if you're going to do this try to force all of your communication into something

44
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:52,470
that has a record try to put it all in the email when you do do e-mail try to be as extensive as possible.

45
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,860
Try to take screen shots of updates take screenshots of changes to the application so you can show on

46
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,170
day one this look like there's some day to look like this.

47
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,660
Put annotations.

48
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,430
Try to keep as much paper as you can because later down the line if something does happen this is the

49
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,840
only thing that's going to stop you from being in a situation with the other person says.

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,220
None of this ever happened.

51
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,890
Now number three when you are communicating with them make sure at every opportunity you have to include

52
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,280
costs and features always list out everything you're doing.

53
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,540
You make sure this is in the written record and you make sure there's a record of your client seeing.

54
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,910
You say it's going to cost this and do this and then agreeing to it.

55
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,860
Now it doesn't necessarily have to be explicit.

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,050
They can see the cost and see what you said you're going to do for them.

57
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,750
And you know just by virtue of the fact they didn't say no and they continued on with the project that

58
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,630
is an implicit agreement at the end of the day if you need to go back written records are going to save

59
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,170
you.

60
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,660
They're a little bit sloppy and they're a little bit tedious but hey there are a lot better than nothing

61
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,690
right.

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,210
And again you're trying to save yourself some time by not writing a contract which would have saved

63
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,450
you all of this trouble.

64
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,990
So in general if a problem actually arises and you get caught running without the ball so to speak running

65
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:15,630
without a contract I wouldn't worry entirely as long as you follow those three things I just covered

66
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,720
with you if you do have an extensive written record of conversations and transcripts and places where

67
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,540
you list out exactly what you're doing and they agreed to it then you're in a decent position.

68
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,470
Obviously you're in a weaker position because you don't have a contract where a signature is pretty

69
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,120
explicit that they agree to it.

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,400
But for the most part you actually do have a solid foundation in virtually every jurisdiction at least

71
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:46,110
in the United States any type of verbal agreement in writing is virtually the same thing as a contract

72
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,700
and any judge or court is going to look at it the same way.

73
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,020
The only problem with them is just that they're so sloppily put together they're very hard to prove

74
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,390
what exactly someone meant by this or is a contract is completely unambiguous.

75
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:06,130
So I wouldn't completely fret if something happens at the end of the day written contracts are still

76
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,050
the law.

77
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,200
And the fact that you have documentation showing that they agreed to something that's pretty much all

78
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,480
you need but it's not advisable and it's really not ideal but there are certain scenarios we're running

79
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,870
another without a contract might be an OK thing to do.

80
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,520
Now keep in mind any long term project should always have a contract no matter what.

81
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:31,120
At the absolute minimum just to have a contract saying that you're being hired to do some work for them

82
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,520
and this is roughly what you're going to do at least you can do that to show that you're in a contracted

83
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,310
relationship and then anything after that is just work that it could be considered a Dinda or additional

84
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,450
work at that point.

85
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,000
There's really it's impossible to deny that you are not in a contract relationship with this person.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,740
They have not willingly agreed to bring you on in some kind of a paid position.

87
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,660
Now remember if you're using one of the online platforms like L.A. or up work they have their own contract

88
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,510
written into it and they use their own escrow services and those scenarios don't worry about it.

89
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,360
OK guys if you feel like running without a contract you don't have to worry too much.

90
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,470
Just keep in mind some very basic things.

91
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,520
Focus on having a written record focus on only doing this with people that you've traded money with

92
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:21,550
and focus on in your written record being explicit as possible listing things out and getting a verbal

93
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,550
agreement.

94
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,870
You're not in a huge amount of trouble.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,770
You're just up for something.

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,600
It's more of a headache down the road.

97
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,590
It's not really the end of the world.

98
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,780
It just might be more time consuming than it would have been otherwise.

99
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,140
All right guys.

100
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:45,230
Any questions posed in the group discussion although I see in the next lecture.
