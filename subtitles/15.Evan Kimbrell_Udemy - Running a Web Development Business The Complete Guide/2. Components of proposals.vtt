00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.150
You guys will come back to the course.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.830
So in this lecture we're going to talk a little bit more about putting together complex proposals.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.110
Now remember complex proposals are the proposals we looked at in our previous lecture.

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.090
Those are the ones that have multiple pages.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.130
They're the ones that are typically going to be made for larger projects or projects that you take more

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.660
seriously now.

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.710
Every single one of you out there is going to have a different strategy when it comes to proposals and

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.300
that's perfectly fine.

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.940
I always suggest that you find what works for you but there's probably going to be a an occasion or

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.000
a situation where you're going to want to make a formal long form proposal.

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.290
So in this lecture we're going to cover what exactly goes into those what you should expect.

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.150
What are some of the optional things you can include.

13
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.060
And we're going to wrap it up.

14
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.270
I'm going to show you some tools that you can use to make the process go a lot smoother.

15
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.970
OK.

16
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.720
Do you remember from the previous lecture where we talked OK.

17
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.730
Do you remember from the previous lecture where I showed you an example of a formal proposal that we

18
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.920
had received I had received a very long time ago that one was from Octa going to pull it up real quickly

19
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.300
to give you a refresher.

20
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.530
All right.

21
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.980
So here was now this is a great example of what a formal proposal looks like it has all of the same

22
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.550
sections and all of the same kind of formal attitude that you would expect out of a formal proposal.

23
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.300
I just wanted to bring it up to give you a refresher of what I mean when I mean by formal proposals

24
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.980
these are the ones that you typically give to corporate clients or big projects.

25
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.360
Now pretty much in every single case there are going to be at least six things included in the proposal

26
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.190
and I've listed out the six that you almost always will see and there are things that I suggest you

27
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.540
always put.

28
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.870
Now there's a couple other optional things and we'll talk about in a second.

29
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.430
But these are the absolute minimum that you should include.

30
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.370
So the first thing is about you.

31
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.840
Now if you saw that on the previous one they have an entire section about who they are how they work

32
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.720
what they choose to do how they like to present themselves in a little bit of information of who they've

33
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.340
worked for before.

34
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.810
Now the reason why you add to this is you need to get your potential client some idea of who you are

35
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.940
as a person.

36
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.360
Now having a human element is always a good thing.

37
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.580
If they have the feeling that this proposal was churned out by a robot and it says nothing about the

38
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.320
person that is proposing it or the company those proposing it they're going to be much less inclined

39
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.860
to feel attached to that person or that proposal.

40
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.560
It kind of comes off as cold transactional almost entirely to business related.

41
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.300
So a lot of times what we see is people will include information about them.

42
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.850
It says Hey I'm a person I am real this is about me.

43
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.240
And often this is used as an opportunity to kind of highlight some of the good things you've done some

44
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.800
of the things that you would normally brag about some of your resume top stories.

45
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.560
Now typically what you'll see is this is going to be a page that goes over a page that's excessive.

46
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.250
OK.

47
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.940
That means that you're kind of distracted.

48
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.060
That means you really need to hone it in.

49
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.670
You shouldn't be talking about yourself that much too early.

50
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.130
Now you can also have it ashore as half a page.

51
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.360
That's perfectly fine if you want to keep it short and condensed and you want to push off more information

52
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.070
later into the proposal.

53
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.930
I generally suggest you go with the industry standard which is one.

54
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.280
OK.

55
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.930
Now is the second component worth discussing is an overview of the project.

56
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.100
Now I listed about you at the top as number one because typically this is something you going to see

57
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.290
at the very beginning of proposals.

58
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.370
Now it's obviously not always the case.

59
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.070
Sometimes we'll see it at the very end as an afterthought.

60
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.200
But typically you want to at the beginning because you want it to be something that your client reads

61
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.590
first.

62
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.940
If you put at the very end and you put all the information about their project in the middle there's

63
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.620
a very good chance they don't even get to the end and you won't be able to frame the way that they look

64
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.570
at this proposal by explaining to them how good you are and all the things you've done and things about

65
00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.150
you.

66
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.960
So it's a good idea to put it first.

67
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.820
Now a second component is the overview of the project.

68
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.270
Now this is something that you might have noticed that some people leave out and it's something I strongly

69
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.400
suggest you put in what you're doing and an overview of the project is going to put something that is

70
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.540
it could be a paragraph or could it be two paragraphs or even that be as long as a page what you're

71
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.470
doing is you are pitching the project back to the client.

72
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.970
Now if you remember previously in our subcontracting strategy sections if you guys are coming from my

73
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.950
outsourcing courses we have a lecture where we talk about the technique called repeating the project

74
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.100
back to you and basically what that means and then in the dynamic of hiring a contractor is that you

75
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.210
want to make sure that that person understands what exactly they're building.

76
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.810
And one of the ways you can do that is by asking them to repeat it back to you then you can kind of

77
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.830
analyze how they explained it how well they understand it.

78
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.210
Are there any missing gaps in their knowledge and so that concept works the exact same way.

79
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.800
When you give an overview of the project you're trying to show them that hey I know how your project

80
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.250
works.

81
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.460
I know what it is I know your problems are.

82
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.240
I'm pitching it back to you to show you how well I understand your project.

83
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.780
Now obviously this can backfire and a lot of times what you'll notice is people will shorten it because

84
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.690
they just simply do not know enough about the context of the project that they're going to be working

85
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.390
on.

86
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.840
And that can be kind of tricky if you make it too short and too and detailed it can actually have the

87
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.290
opposite effect where it seems like the person simply doesn't know anything about the project at all.

88
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.920
Now now if you're already in the mix and you've already been taking in clients and doing some development

89
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.750
work you probably know that a lot of times we'll be submitting proposals and you don't really understand

90
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.170
who the target client is what they do.

91
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.770
How does this project fit into the wider context of their company.

92
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.050
So that was usually tricky and that's something that you might have to do some background research to

93
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.460
get right you might have to go to their Web site or read about them get a better understanding of what

94
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.070
it you might need to incorporate more questions about like why do they want to make changes or why do

95
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.670
they want to build this.

96
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.200
What are the issues that they're facing.

97
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.170
What are the issues that they're trying to fix.

98
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.880
Like asking them at the end of your correspondence whether or not you have all of your assumptions correct

99
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.790
just saying hey can you help me for a second.

100
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.480
This is what I think the problem is.

101
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.110
Just correct me if I'm wrong.

102
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.690
Now third component you'll see that I strongly assess you add is how you work now.

103
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.490
If you are someone that's going to be using agile.

104
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.310
This is a great opportunity to explain what that is and why it's a benefit.

105
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.700
Now this is something that works out for us really really well because being able to explain agile is

106
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.250
a great opportunity to explain all of the benefits of agile.

107
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.170
Now you need to be able to explain what the benefits are to have this kind of bonus effect.

108
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.950
So it might be something that you need to practice if you are going to work in an agile manner.

109
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.140
Now if you're not going be using Agile or you are going to be using some of the other things that are

110
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:03.350
good or efficient about the way that you do work this is where you're going to describe your individual

111
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.690
step by step process and explain how you intake information you're going explain how you're going to

112
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.830
be updating them.

113
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.870
You probably will explain what technologies you're going to use.

114
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:20.180
This is where you typically will explain what your philosophies are about work or what strategies you

115
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.690
personally like to use now how you work is almost always a sales opportunity.

116
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.700
This is where you say that we are sophisticated and cutting edge or you say I use common sense when

117
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.230
I do my work schedule or my work schedules really relaxed or it's really professional.

118
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:41.500
This is typically somewhere where you're going to try to put in some form of your individual messaging

119
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:47.600
and previously in the course we talked all up and down about picking what message works for your target

120
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.850
client base and picking what matches you yourself who you are what you want to get out of this.

121
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.960
Once you figured that out you'll be able to start working this better.

122
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.140
So plan on you know your first couple of complex proposals.

123
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:04.010
It might be something that you're kind of making up on the fly when it comes to how you work and how

124
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.290
you see work.

125
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.120
But don't waste this opportunity to explain your process.

126
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.610
It will also help with communication so that when they do accept your project they will understand what

127
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.750
are the next steps.

128
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.120
It's not something whether in the dark constantly asking you what are we doing next.

129
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:26.400
OK so timeline timeline is pretty obvious this is where you just list off how long the project's going

130
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.610
to take.

131
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:32.040
This is something that if you leave out I think you make a pretty big mistake if you're giving someone

132
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.110
a complex proposal.

133
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.100
It should be complete.

134
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:39.930
You shouldn't be sending off a well-polished PDAF that doesn't say how long this project is going to

135
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:45.990
take unless in some weird situation you have a client who absolutely doesn't care about the timeline.

136
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:51.630
I think even in that case you probably want to give them some basis of how long you think this is going

137
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.160
to take and maybe you can use a range.

138
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:59.490
Personally I like to get as detail as possible timelines but obviously be mindful of the fact that you

139
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.590
can hamstring yourself.

140
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:06.150
You can actually set yourself up for failure if you give too much detail and then you get into the project

141
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.070
and realize that a lot of that was inaccurate.

142
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.330
It's very very hard to forecast these things so try to be as detailed as possible as you can.

143
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.190
At the same time don't make any estimates you think are going to be a problem later.

144
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.560
So the fifth one obviously is price.

145
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.510
And if you listen to previous lecture where I talked about how we break down our estimates I obviously

146
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:30.690
suggest that you try to break down your price as much as possible when you give a complex proposal to

147
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.700
someone they're going to send it to other people.

148
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.200
People are going to see that and the number one page they are most interested in is price.

149
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.490
They're going to look at that they're going to try to dissect it.

150
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.550
They're kind of try to pick and compare your sections that other people.

151
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.130
So try not to be too vague.

152
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:51.420
Say of one development firm sends a proposal that says this project's going to cost $15000 and that's

153
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.860
it they just give a line that say total project or you have another one compared to that where they

154
00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:01.710
say the same thing 15000 but they break it down and they explain what section costs the most what individual

155
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:07.650
technology integration is going to cost the most or what specific actions or tasks are going to take

156
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.790
up the most of the budget.

157
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.920
In that scenario you're almost always going to go with the one that gave you more clarity gave you more

158
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.920
information you're gonna feel more confident about that person.

159
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.840
There's always kind of a negative association with people who are too vague when it comes to estimates.

160
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.010
If I give one big price or just two prices or broken down a couple of ways.

161
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:31.440
As a Pitts as a client they might feel as if you're trying to pull something on them or trying to hide

162
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.910
costs that are either outside of their budget or you simply do not know enough about to give a real

163
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:38.650
asset.

164
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.840
And if that's the case and if it is the case you don't know enough to give a real estimate you shouldn't

165
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.810
be making a complex proposal to begin with.

166
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.480
You should be getting more information before the step.

167
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.600
Now number seven is next steps and I think this is something that's crucial and it gets left out almost

168
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.620
all the time.

169
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.710
Next step is what you put at the very end.

170
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.710
You say if you accept this proposal this is exactly what we're going to do.

171
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.560
This is where you talk about what are your payment terms.

172
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.840
This is the way you talk about what when you need payment in regard to when you work and when you're

173
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.030
going to deliver it.

174
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.470
This is where you're going to tell them what deliverables you need specifically if you need graphic

175
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.470
design files this is where you tell them exactly when you need it.

176
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:22.620
This is really really helpful because a lot of times people say yes this is great let's start but they

177
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.430
don't know what's going to happen next.

178
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.570
So next steps helps them say hey we're ready to roll.

179
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.400
We can start working on this as soon as you give us the green light.

180
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.210
And you want them to have that feeling.

181
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.440
You want them to feel as if it's just up to them everything's ready to go.

182
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.810
Now the last thing is disclaimers and this is just something that you will get better at over time.

183
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:49.830
Disclaimers will be kind of all over the proposal but this is really where I will say things like if

184
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:55.650
this changes then the estimate will change or if this happens and the timeline might change.

185
00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:01.620
And basically you just kind of protect yourself in the case that you make a you make a statement and

186
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.720
it doesn't end up being exactly true.

187
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:09.870
Now the most important thing to put a disclaimer for in my experience.

188
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:15.860
So it's very very important though when you have a price you say on the price page if any new features

189
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.030
are added or any process in this proposal is changed.

190
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:24.100
Then we need to re-evaluate the price because that will also change.

191
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:29.690
You would be surprised how many clients don't actually realize that and don't actually know that this

192
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:35.090
project that this price you're giving them covers everything they could possibly imagine and not just

193
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.620
specifically what they describe to you.

194
00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:43.580
So you need to make sure that you include that other things worth putting disclaimers on I'd say it's

195
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.070
really important on the timeline.

196
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:51.500
If you say that if you identify any type of integrations or technologies that you're not 100 percent

197
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:58.700
familiar with it's worth putting a disclaimer saying that you know your timeline is based on you assuming

198
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.210
that it's reasonable and easy to implement.

199
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.300
And if it ends up being the case that it's not that you would say that it could be the case the timeline

200
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:11.570
is delayed just so they know that there's a couple little sections in this project that could potentially

201
00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.710
blow up and become something much much larger.

202
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:21.170
So if you have a client who has a strict deadline a strict kind of a strict timetable for this project

203
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:28.550
and you put that that signals to them that hey this is a project that you cannot time perfectly doesn't

204
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.800
matter who else is going to make it.

205
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.150
Just different technologies.

206
00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.630
You always run into problems and you're always potentially end up taking more time.

207
00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:41.260
That's something that you need to plan for in your own kind of project timeline.

208
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:46.000
All right and quickly we're going to wrap up with what are some of the optional components of proposals.

209
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.030
You'll probably see this.

210
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:51.680
If you've ever gotten a lot of estimates from firms you've worked with a lot of Freelancer these are

211
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.480
the two main ones that I identify that are worth considering putting in.

212
00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.900
But it really just kind of depends on who you are how you work and what your situation is.

213
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.930
So we'll cover these pretty briefly.

214
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.440
So number one is case studies.

215
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.280
This is something you'll see a lot of time.

216
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:13.070
You'll see these long PTF and sometimes it'll be a 10 page NPF and five pages will be case studies that

217
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.240
they've attached.

218
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.500
Now Case studies are a powerful tool for convincing your client that you know what you're doing.

219
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:25.610
You've worked with really strong reputable brands or even just to show off what you're capable of.

220
00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.500
But now the question of whether or not you would add a case study into your proposal really really just

221
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.370
depend in my personal opinion.

222
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:40.170
It's very rare that I've seen case studies be added to a proposal and it's actually a benefit.

223
00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.870
Typically what it ends up doing is it just bloats the proposal makes a proposal way too long.

224
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:50.060
It makes the odds that your client finishes the entire thing much much lower and a lot of times it's

225
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.560
just frankly a distraction.

226
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.670
I love case studies.

227
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.510
I think they're great.

228
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:59.000
I think it's something that you need to put on your website or you might want to put it somewhere in

229
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.490
a PTF or a package that you deliver to clients that are interested in your portfolio or interested in

230
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.060
who you are and how you work but not specifically asking for a proposal yet.

231
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.880
The one exception to this where I've seen case studies work well is where you add one or two case studies

232
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.370
that are specifically relevant to what they're doing.

233
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:23.210
So if you're trying to build an application and you worked on one previously that was very very similar

234
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.650
and in a number of different dimensions then it's absolutely something you could add.

235
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.900
You could say we built this project.

236
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.360
It worked out so well.

237
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.330
You know if the client said this about it they are so happy about us.

238
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.110
This is clearly something that we've worked on before.

239
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.840
That is a very very powerful thing.

240
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:44.690
If you can do that now now what you need to be careful though of is adding a case study that has nothing

241
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.980
to do with the project if you had a case study that has nothing to do with the project then you actually

242
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.330
will have a problem because it is a distraction and it also shows that you probably don't understand

243
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.810
their project very well.

244
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.270
So case studies you can add them if you have some.

245
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.770
But make sure that it's relevant if it's relevant and it's really really relevant.

246
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:07.850
Then it'll be good but if it's not something that's relevant to what they're building or at least the

247
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:13.010
relevancy is not obvious that it's actually going to distract it's actually ends up making it look like

248
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:18.330
the proposal you gave them is not very customized or that the person who made the proposal didn't or

249
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.310
didn't really think about what they were delivering very much at all.

250
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.650
OK and so the last thing is development contracts.

251
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:29.170
This is the last thing you will see quite frequently a lot of times in proposals.

252
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:34.670
Firms or freelancers and developers will add in the contract into it.

253
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.430
Now the reason why people do that is they think it's a convenience right.

254
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.840
So if someone's happy about the proposal they say yes this is great.

255
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.230
Then they have the contract right there ready to go.

256
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.240
I emphatically say no don't do that.

257
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.180
It's not something I've ever seen work.

258
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:56.090
Well what ends up happening is you have a five page proposal six page proposal on your development contract

259
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.020
could be four to five pages.

260
00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:04.490
You've doubled the length with some really really wordy legal leaves attachment that doesn't add value

261
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:05.580
to your proposal.

262
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.240
The point of your proposal is to convince the client that you are the best option for this project.

263
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.470
It's a convince them that you know what you're doing.

264
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:17.060
You thought about their project you have the necessary skills and potentially you've done it before

265
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.280
if you don't have a case.

266
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.140
I think a development contract doesn't do that.

267
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.260
It distracts from that.

268
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.360
Contracts are something that you're going to discuss once you've already got to the point where they

269
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.390
say yes I want to work with you.

270
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:34.310
One of the problems with development contracts is that people naturally are going to have a mild allergic

271
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.070
reaction to contracts.

272
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:42.300
If you've ever seen a contract and signed it how often have you signed a contract yourself where you

273
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.960
felt completely at ease when you signed your signature.

274
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:51.510
That's because contracts are complicated contracts include a lot of things that are not easy to understand

275
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:57.360
and a lot of different use cases are baked into that you've never heard of and you don't know what you're

276
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.020
signing up.

277
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:02.870
You're signing yourself up to the last thing I'll say about that is we talked about previously about

278
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:08.070
minimizing friction with your clients when you're giving them a proposal you do want to minimize friction

279
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.070
the way you do that is by limiting how much unnecessary information you give them by making it easy

280
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:19.010
for them to get back to you by making it easy for them to know what exactly starts next.

281
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.230
What are the next steps and exactly what you need from them.

282
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.400
Now adding a development contract just is the opposite of that.

283
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.780
Now all of a sudden you have a proposal that could be read in five to 10 minutes you had a development

284
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:35.880
contract and it's going to take them 30 to 45 minutes to completely read it and understand it.

285
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.190
It just doesn't it doesn't make sense.

286
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:43.290
It's really in my opinion an inappropriate thing to add but don't be surprised when you see people do

287
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:43.700
it.

288
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:48.450
OK so the next lecture we're going to go over some easy tools for producing proposals.

289
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.660
I'm going to show you that it's not something you really have to fret about.

290
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.310
It's actually quite easy to put together a complex proposal.

291
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.140
You don't necessarily need design skills yourself.

292
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.580
A lot of people out there have the same problem that you have.

293
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:05.880
This is the first time you're creating a proposal and there's a lot of really really good tools that

294
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.590
have been made to address this problem.

295
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.340
So the next one we're going to do in a real quick crash course in going to show you what are some of

296
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:16.200
the good tools out there that are worth using and what are some of your options for getting this done

297
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.770
easily.

298
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.670
All right so in the next lecture.
