00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:05.970
Hey guys.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.980
Welcome back to the course.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.650
So in this lecture we're going to talk about efficiency saving techniques and things that can help you

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.030
identify whether or not your client is Just Not That Into You.

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.820
So I call this lecture is tell when you're getting fizzled.

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.030
So I call it fizzle just simply because something that fizzles as something that bubbles and then just

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.670
slowly dies off.

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.410
Now getting fizzled in regards to development means that your client is not interested in the project

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.770
proposal you've given them and they're slowly disconnecting and slowly kind of backing away.

10
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.180
Now this is going to happen all the time.

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.400
You can't win every single contract.

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.540
This is the natural reaction of someone who looks for a proposal and for whatever reason does not like

13
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.940
what they see now being able to tell whether or not they're doing this to you can save you a ton of

14
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.230
time especially when you get to a point where you're juggling lots and lots of proposals.

15
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.370
You really don't want to waste your time or your developers time working on proposals that are going

16
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.080
towards someone who's actually in the process of fizzling you.

17
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.730
So first to help you understand.

18
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.930
Let's talk a little bit about why they might be doing this to you.

19
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.140
There's a lot of different reasons and it typically has to do with one of several sections in your proposal.

20
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.290
It could be they don't have the money for this project.

21
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.260
It could be that they are not actually serious about completing the project as you think might have

22
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.810
actually gotten to a point where they are not actually confident in the idea anymore because it's gotten

23
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.540
so complicated and a lot of times you have potential clients who just finally get to a point where they

24
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.570
feel like they're in over their head.

25
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.130
And then lastly it could be possible that they're looking at other offers so maybe there's another vendor

26
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.600
who clearly just hit the mark much better than you did.

27
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.250
They're slowly going to back off and start going with that vendor.

28
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.070
Now the moral of the story here is that when people start this process it can go on for ever.

29
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.970
So you need to cut your losses as soon as you recognize this is being done to you.

30
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:15.470
Seriously I've been fizzled for like six months before on clients and wasted hours and hours with them.

31
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.700
And in retrospect it was only when I realized that they were doing the same things over and over that

32
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.240
I should have noticed that were pretty much big red flags showing to me they're not actually interested.

33
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.670
So here are four things you can look for to see relatively whether or not they're slightly out the door

34
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.520
or if they're still actually enthusiastic about the project.

35
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.450
So the first red flag is what I call pyramid conversations.

36
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.970
So like a pyramid it starts off at the bottom that's large and it gets to the top or it's really small.

37
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.320
Now how I relate to the development is these are the type of clients when you first start talking to

38
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.120
them they give you tons and tons of information.

39
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.270
But every subsequent communication you have with them their communication and their information they're

40
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.710
giving to you get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.

41
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.910
They start off with a page of info the next one is very enthusiastic maybe it's three quarters of a

42
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.570
page.

43
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.990
By the time they're done they're responding and singular sentences.

44
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.160
Now this is not the sign of a client who has simply run out of things to say.

45
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.860
This is a sign of a client whose lost enthusiasm in you.

46
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.440
This is what they're doing when they themselves realize that you are unlikely to be the person that

47
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.510
they go with or the firm that they go with.

48
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.170
And they're slowly backing off and minimizing their resource investment and time investment in you.

49
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.000
Now why don't they just cut off entirely.

50
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.250
Well because a lot of people still think they can get information out of you.

51
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.410
They still would like to ask questions they would still like to use estimates and a lot of them do they

52
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.840
want to use that to anchor it against another firm they're actually going to work for.

53
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.540
But their language never lies their commitment to you should be pretty obvious if they're using pyramid

54
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.530
conversations.

55
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.980
Now the second one is slower and slower response times.

56
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.810
Even if it's two questions or tidbits of information that are really trivial and really standard.

57
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.580
So at first you might see that the client responds within an hour within six hours within the same day.

58
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.470
But over time you start to notice then it's like three hours then it's like 10 hours then it's like

59
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.210
a couple days then it's like a couple weeks.

60
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.800
You're getting Faysal basic.

61
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.370
That's the same thing.

62
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.070
Another way of displaying it as often happens with pyramide ization the client is basically just backing

63
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.540
off spending more time on other people but they still feel the need that they should respond somewhat.

64
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.180
Now one foolproof way to kind of tell if this is happening without having to calculate your e-mail response

65
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.700
time is to look at the questions you're asking them.

66
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.810
If you're asking a really simple question When do you want to start the project what do you do you have

67
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.450
a logo What's the name.

68
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.460
Basic stuff.

69
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.320
And it takes them a long time to respond to that.

70
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.030
That means they're not serious about you.

71
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.780
It's not the case that they're taking time to research these questions because they're trivial.

72
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.470
They should be able to respond with the same amount of time that you use beforehand so clearly they're

73
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.400
backing away.

74
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.240
Number three repeatedly asking you to clarify or re answer questions you've already answered.

75
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.510
Now this will happen all the time.

76
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.770
A lot of times people ask a question you give them an estimate and then they'll start asking you questions

77
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.550
about the estimate you gave.

78
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.550
What kind of tell tale sign that they're trying to back away or slow roll this is they start asking

79
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.830
you the same questions.

80
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.480
Really this is kind of like a symptom of you know if you're talking to someone and they're also talking

81
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.950
to three other people they might not realize that they've asked you the same question.

82
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.990
That's essentially what's going on here.

83
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.500
They're either too distracted by other people and they're asking you the same question because they

84
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.170
forgot what they've asked or the question you're answering just isn't sticking with them and they're

85
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:51.950
really confident in your answer and in general they're just unconfident in you and then never for using

86
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.750
vague timelines and referring to things like decisions.

87
00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.000
Now this is another one someone who's serious about you is going to want to capture your business.

88
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.690
So they're going to be as definite as possible with regards to their timeline.

89
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.650
People who are overly vague just saying oh we're going to do it in a couple months or we're going to

90
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.270
do in the fall Q2 things like that.

91
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.730
That's when they're being overly vague.

92
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.140
Typically if they're interested in you they'll give you a month or they'll give you an actual like hard

93
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.520
deadline with some different milestones.

94
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.450
This is going to happen this is going to happen and this is what we want to start.

95
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.380
Another thing that often comes along with this is when people refer to decisions lawyers say you know

96
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.440
what a couple of months we want to make a decision or they'll say they're going to refer it back to

97
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.440
other people and we're going to make a decision later to prove that this is a way of offloading kind

98
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.350
of the guilt of not picking you they'll just say Oh it's it's up to the decision making gods it's up

99
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.520
to my partners to say no.

100
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.170
Really they're just backing away if they really were interested they would never say oh we're going

101
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.390
to make a decision.

102
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.900
They would tell you that they're interested.

103
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.150
They would indicate that they're interested and never say something like that.

104
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.830
So watch out for that one just as much as the others.

105
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.700
OK so those are four ways you can kind of tell if you're getting Fazal try to use your intuition.

106
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:14.060
All you guys are pretty good at this and it's kind of a skill that you develop over time.

107
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.730
People do this outside of development as well.

108
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:22.430
They do it in relationships they do it in any professional setting or scenario you just kind of have

109
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:28.990
to be aware of things that are kind of projecting towards you hey I'm backing away.

110
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:35.120
You do need to be aware though that a lot of people will continue working with you because they think

111
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.190
they can get information out of it or I don't even know sometimes they'll just keep it going for no

112
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.580
reason.

113
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.310
So it's really important to notice that they're doing this and get out.

114
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.620
OK.

115
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.480
Any questions.

116
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.620
Group discussion.

117
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.590
Private message me.

118
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:56.820
Although I see in the next lecture.
