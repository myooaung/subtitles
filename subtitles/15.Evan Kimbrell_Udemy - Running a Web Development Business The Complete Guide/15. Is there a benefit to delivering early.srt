00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,040
You guys will go back to the course.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:13,050
So in this lecture we're going to talk about what's the benefit if any of delivering your product to

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,500
your project early.

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,380
Now a lot of you might have thought when I said under-promise over deliver that might mean for instance

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,650
giving a lax timeline and then delivering it early.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:29,860
Now while that is an example of over delivering that just gives you the wrong impression unfortunately.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,590
So let me just answer the question.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,510
Just delivering early benefit you in some way.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,690
No not really.

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,600
And if it does it's very marginal.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,610
Personally if I have the office of delivering really I actually will work on the project more internally

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,940
do more testing do more deep dives try to fix more bugs that might be cosmetic.

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,570
Spend more time on it and deliver on the deadline that I promise.

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,480
Now why is that.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,600
Well just in general when you tell someone this is the deadline.

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,190
Not only do they plan for that deadlines if you give it to them early it might actually just sit for

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,010
a couple of days so you're not giving them more time to the organization any real benefit.

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,800
Really the only benefit to giving it to them early is that you appear as if you're a good vendor and

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,110
that is really about it.

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,810
But in all practicality there's very few benefits.

21
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,540
In most cases we're talking and delivering something early median a week early.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,170
Maybe it's a couple days early.

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,700
It's not going to really matter if you give it to them on July 1st and they're expecting on July 3rd.

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,990
What exactly are they going to do in those two days.

25
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,670
You saved the money or gave them an extra feature or did something really well that is important to

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,940
them that affects their bottom line delivering early doesn't really actually mean anything to them because

27
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,270
that time they didn't plan to use and they probably don't have anything.

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,540
They could use it for.

29
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,340
So if you have the option of delivering early maybe you overestimated.

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,970
That's great spend more time working on the project try to spend a little bit more time on line testing

31
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,830
and making sure that when you do give it to them it does have kind of a wow effect so it's usually a

32
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,700
good thing.

33
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,880
It means you're efficient.

34
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,250
It means that you give yourself plenty of breathing room.

35
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,140
So take that time and really perfect the project and keep in mind there's really no real benefit to

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,310
delivering early.

37
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,500
It's not like a lot of other industries.

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:22,890
All right.

39
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,290
If you have any questions about this.

40
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,550
Any examples this ever happened to you were you ever thrilled that you got a project back early.

41
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:41,390
Just post the group discussion let me know otherwise see the next lecture.
