00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,920
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about something that can

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,090
severely hamstring your portfolio and something that when addressed correctly can dramatically improve

3
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,370
your product in Project quality.

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:26,400
Now a lot of times you have a project that you work on that's big it's grand It's ambitious it's interesting

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,400
from a technical perspective you put a lot of work into it.

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,090
And when the product launches it is just not something that you want to show off.

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,800
Now I'm not talking about something that you might have botched in some way or something that you just

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,790
don't really like what it's about.

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,420
I'm talking about it's a product that comes out.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,310
It's just not very impressive.

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,330
It looks like it's from the 90s.

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,450
It's something that just doesn't look like it's trendsetting or something that might reflect a high

13
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,190
quality application.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,820
Now a lot of times the culprit in this situation is the design.

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,020
And since this is for developers are people starting development businesses that is technically something

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,720
that might be outside of the scope of your control.

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,620
Now this is the problem happens to developers all the time.

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,580
You work on something.

19
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,250
It's great but the designer is just not up to speed.

20
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,680
They're not high quality and it ends up making the app look bad.

21
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,840
We control all the functionality of the application we control everything that happens below the visual

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:32,640
layer but customers on the other hand they see the visual layer first and only the most acute the most

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,100
experience ones even pay attention to how complex the back end interactions are.

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,280
Simply put ugly user interface is ugly to everyone.

25
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,070
Ugly code is only ugly to the developer that's looking at it.

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,210
So if this is a problem you're having you're having a lot of cool projects but none of them are really

27
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,790
portfolio worthy or something you really want to show off.

28
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,290
And it's because of design.

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,760
I have a couple of tips for you to how you can fix this.

30
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,550
So keep in mind great design makes a great portfolio.

31
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:08,400
The first thing you can do is take into consideration who is the designer when you make a decision to

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,440
work with a client.

33
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,360
Take some time to actually look at who they employ.

34
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,810
Look at where the design is coming from and see if you can request this up front.

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,590
Now I'm not saying that if it's bad design it's not a project you should take on at all.

36
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,870
But I'm saying that you should take this as a factor in your judgment about whether or not this is a

37
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,310
client you want to work with whether or not there's a client you don't want to work with or whether

38
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,600
or not it's a client you really do.

39
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,820
And someone that you want to put a lot of pressure on or work really hard to try to create a contract

40
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,320
with.

41
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,210
So take that into consideration ask them who it is ask to see the designs before you get them.

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,770
Another thing you can actually do is to keep a list of all the designers you worked with or ones that

43
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,220
you admire that you think make good reasonably priced design.

44
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:58,470
And when it comes to that point because remember you are usually contracted after the conception stage

45
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,270
and potentially after the design phase introduce that person as an option to your client.

46
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,380
A lot of times clients are also not happy with their design or they simply don't have that design.

47
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,030
So if you introduce someone you know creates high quality work you're setting yourself up to work on

48
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,720
a project that could actually be shown off.

49
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,390
Now the last option is to offer design services yourself.

50
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,550
There's a lot of reasons why that's helpful and why people like that a lot find a designer that you

51
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,170
work with.

52
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,470
Well try working with them on a couple of projects to find out very quickly the ones you really like

53
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,950
and the ones that you can work with for a long period of time.

54
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,980
You might even consider not making a margin on their rates because remember whatever they design is

55
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,380
going to be the face of anything you develop.

56
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,090
So if they're really really good it shouldn't matter to you you're getting a lot of benefits just from

57
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,000
working with them.

58
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,430
If you have a top of the line designer and they're up on the trends and there's someone that puts a

59
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,100
lot of thought down to every pixel of what they put together anything they produce and anything you

60
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,620
then subsequently develop is going to look great.

61
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,060
Doesn't matter how ugly or how clunky your programming is.

62
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,050
It could have been one of your worst projects ever it's still going to look good and it's going to look

63
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,870
good to 99 percent of the people who see it.

64
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,870
Now that is true.

65
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,460
And you know in the reverse scenario where you have great development ugly design what we already covered

66
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,620
that's terrible.

67
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,030
You have to remember that clients are at the end of the day customers and there are no real difference

68
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,370
between them and their end users.

69
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:32,490
They still look at an app and they see it and they see it just the same way that any old an educated

70
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,850
user is going to see it.

71
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,940
So take this into consideration.

72
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,950
Bad design always gets hidden away and you never could just show it off.

73
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,730
Again it's just as valuable as the dollar amount that you put into it.

74
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,040
And great design can honestly really change how many leads you get how many clients you close how great

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,860
your web presence is and how great your portfolio is.

76
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,760
So if you're running into this problem try to tackle it in a variety of ways.

77
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,800
Make sure you know who the designer is.

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,560
Make a judgment on whether or not you think there a good designer and decide whether or not that's a

79
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,810
cause you want to take on.

80
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:11,180
You can similarly open up your own network designers and use them as an introduction to your client

81
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,170
so that you can know that someone you've worked with before is introducing the project.

82
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:22,070
Now you could also go as far as to do what we do and have your own designer and then include them in

83
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,670
any development package that you do that gives you additional benefits as a service.

84
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,370
But it also allows you to know exactly the quality of the design that's going to come down the line

85
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,050
for you and then put into your portfolio.

86
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,430
All right guys questions on this post in the group discussion.

87
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:46,660
Otherwise see in the next lecture.
