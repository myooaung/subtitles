00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
first,

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.350
let's try to understand what rest really mean.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.290
It is an acronym for representational state Transfer.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.640
But if you want to understand in simple English,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.750
really from rewards,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.690
it sounds like transfer of state in different representations.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.020
The term stayed here refers to the state off a collection of objects known as a resource.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.230
For example,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.160
products customers orders users can all be considered as resources In general.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.070
Resource has some information which is called estate on the client.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.040
Answer was made.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.880
Exchange are transformed the theme in different formats,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.350
which is called a presentations.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.490
For example,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.900
a mobile application may request a sore toe.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.890
Provide state of her source in XML format,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.090
while another Web application may request the server for the same state.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.220
In Jason format,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.910
both server and claim Gambar again for the representation off state from each other,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.550
which is stoned as content negotiation.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.820
This type of communication between the client and the server is carried out.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.070
Using the Web as transport platform on level is the http protocol features while working

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.670
with rest Web services.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.270
Following must be Remember number one resource is accessed.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.280
Wear uniforms.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.230
This is identify,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.970
there are you are number do the X GDP request methods such as Get post put on delete actors

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.970
.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.880
Words are action to be performed on a resource.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.850
For example,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.530
while they get requests for a given you are,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.730
you might get the state from the server a post request for the thing you are.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.590
I might add a new state to the existing This source number three that it's TDP header

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.360
except is used by a climb to negotiate with the server.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.250
What kind of representation is needed by the client?

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.540
For example,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.620
a value off applications like Jason for this header tells the server to send a Jason the

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.750
presentation of the resource on number four.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.310
The It's DDB header content type is used by a client to indicate what representation of the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.850
state is sent as Taylor by the client where it's TDP posed are put method
