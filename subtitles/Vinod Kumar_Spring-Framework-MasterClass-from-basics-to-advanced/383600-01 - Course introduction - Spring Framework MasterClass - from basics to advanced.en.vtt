00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
hello and welcome toe spring framework Masterclass.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.060
My name is we know on and I'll be your instructor for this course.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.280
I'm a professional,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.980
softer trainer and I have trained hundreds of thousands of software engineers in the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.290
industry for past 24 years.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.470
This is a pure,

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.450
no nonsense courts that covers from basic stored once topics in spring framework.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.890
This course will be updated with more really lectures and assignments based on the constant

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.840
feedback from students like yourself.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.010
Because of my worst experience in teaching this technology toe software professionals many

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.350
of the times I would have already answered your questions even before you come across one.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.450
However,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.860
if you find anything not understandable are guarded question on a topic that I'm explaining

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.860
.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.840
Please feel free to post it on this platform itself,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.710
and I'll be back with an answer or a solution within 24 hours.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.260
Usually I will respond immediately,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.870
but the delay would only be due toa time zone difference.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.350
So I hope you will join this learning journey with me and enjoy the course as much as I

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.630
injured creating the same
