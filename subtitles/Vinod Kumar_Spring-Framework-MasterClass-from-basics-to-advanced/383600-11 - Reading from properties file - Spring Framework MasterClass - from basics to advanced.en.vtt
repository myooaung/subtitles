00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.350
that I look at the Afcon Trig one where we have hard accorded the values off these in a

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.150
Java program.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.350
So which is not a good practice?

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.500
The best practice is toe externalize these values into a properties file so that they can

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.460
be changed without having to re compile our programs as well as we can supply them during

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.950
time.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.410
Why are the runtime perimeters toe do the same?

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.790
First,

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.740
let's goto our SRC main resources.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.320
Let's create a new properties file so I don't see a properties file our new file over here

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.770
I could.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.030
And under general,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.750
we have a file option I can click on next.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.350
And since I selected that SRC mainly sources,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.890
that's what is shown over here.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.570
We can give any name we want.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.610
Let's give the name as Jenny me si dot properties finish on Dhere.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.850
We will give some key value pairs that represent these values.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.060
Let's give the key as Jerry Massie,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.530
Dark Driver equals toe our God,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.810
it's two dot driver jerry,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.780
busy dot ural equals toe Jerry.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.690
Busy colon.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.590
It's to Poland.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.380
TCP Colon double slash local host slash your home directory slash spring dash training

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.320
That's the name of the baby Jenny visit our user equals Toe s a jerry.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.980
Busy dot password equals toe blank stream.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.520
The keys are totally your choice.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.850
You can give anything you want,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.490
but this is the practice that I have developed.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.580
So now I can go to my at conflict one and tell that there is a properties file called Jerry

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.580
.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.740
Visited properties in our class.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.950
Spot on.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.460
We have toe lower these keys from there.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.190
To do that,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.080
we go toe up conflict one and add an annotation called property source the property so

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.420
sanitation can be configured within a day.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.480
Off strings are a single string.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.750
Enough.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.290
In my case,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.420
I have a single properties file here on the property file is found in the transport,

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.850
and the name is jenny busy dot properties.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.930
So this file now contains all the key value appear so it has already loaded using something

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.080
like a resource abundant,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.050
but we know want to get those things into these functions here.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.480
So to do that,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.140
let's declare a couple of variables.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.630
Let's declare the valuables,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.380
whatever the variables that we want corresponding toe these property.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.210
Keith here.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.560
So I have your driver.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.270
You are a loser.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.820
Passports angry with the same thing over here as a private string.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.530
I can tell driver or I can use.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.100
Try work.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.590
Last name.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.710
Which is what is the perimeter off this center here,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.980
Beyonce Ousting your in.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.020
We have your fire itching user private thing.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.390
Possible toe.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.900
Read the value from this properties and assign an appropriate value from the key.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.990
We can see her at the rate value which is an annotation from spring not from Lombok.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.750
And then specify that it is supposed to get jerry busy dot driver,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.980
which is the actual key for which there is a value called our got hitched to the driver on

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.980
.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.640
This is a value that we want toe inject into this variable.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.230
Likewise.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.370
I can not copy this and paste for all of them.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.770
So I'm rooting this toe.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.860
You are This is gonna be your user.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.730
And then the last one is the password.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.820
So now I have all the values read from the GBC property studies member variables we can

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.190
know make use off the same over here.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.610
So by just typing your tribe or class name,

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.030
this is gonna be the you are.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.040
This is user and possible.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.700
And now that we have made the changes,

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.100
we can verify that this is actually working or not by going to our application around the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.690
theme.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.350
Since there is no better,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.510
I should simply get the result.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.680
But in case if I give a wrong password,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.380
for example,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.280
that they give you re not save it from the court since the password is wrong,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.400
this should give me and head of saying that wrong.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.990
Use the name our passwords.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.800
So that's the message that I'm getting over here.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.850
Let's go back.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.760
Change that toe empty string.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.650
Save this.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.720
Run the core,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.250
get output once again properly.
