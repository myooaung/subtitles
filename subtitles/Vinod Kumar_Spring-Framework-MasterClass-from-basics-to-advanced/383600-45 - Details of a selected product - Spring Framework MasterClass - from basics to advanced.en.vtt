00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
suppose we want to provide a hyperlink toe this particular product name taking on which I

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.840
want to get the details off the product to do so.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.250
Let's go back to Eclipse.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.450
Stop the Tomcats are were for no and go to the show products Jsp,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.220
where we are displaying the product name.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.440
We just want to provide a hyperlink for that.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.640
Let's make some room over here.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.440
Give a hitter F equals two and let's say,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.450
for example,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.350
dot slash product details.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.630
We also want to supply the I.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.140
D off the current product,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:44.350
which I can say I d equals toe dollar p dot product ID and then close the double course

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.750
that the hyperlink and close the hyperlink after the product name is given.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.350
So that's my e slash inside that the product me.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.300
Let's also give a CSS class for this so it looks like a nice hyperlink.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.840
So it's called last Bt and Bt and Link Save this.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.770
So when it is run,

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.790
if I click on a particular product name,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.720
it's supposed to go to this particular controller.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.270
We don't have a handler for this particular urine.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.180
Let's goto our product controller,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.410
create a handler function toe,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.780
receive this particular idee and then go to a jsp,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.650
which can display the complete details.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.820
Let's see how easy it is to do that.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.700
So let's go toe product controller at a new function or hear public string that the return

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.950
type,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.250
which is the viewing that solid as get product details.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.760
It receives an integer idee as the last model modern because we want to store the model

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.200
later.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.830
Truce deal.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.650
Exception.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.580
The first thing that we will do is tow redone product details as the name.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.510
So this is going to be a jsp in our Web A and F slash pages folder we don't have yet.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.970
We're also going to do it.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.420
Recruits,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.780
mapping and in the request mapping,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.420
we can simply take slash product details.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.420
That is what the hyperlinks stays here in the show products.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.070
JC Product details Idea is supposed to be received as a request perimeter.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.800
We have declared that variable over here will say you're at the rate request problem and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.160
now I can come down here and then say model dot add attribute.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.420
The name I can call it Dusty are,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.760
or any other name you feel like here and say Hedge,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.130
t d awoke dot Get the product and supply the i d.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.850
I deceived.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.240
So when I go to the product details speech,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.030
we can access the product using this attribute name.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.780
Call Pia,

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.160
so let's quickly clear the product details.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.800
Speech.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.090
Go to the Explorer.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.620
Right click pages.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.510
New jsp on,

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.270
then that's the name product details that jsp Let's get it off everything.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.650
The first is the included directive.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.710
Finally,

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:11.970
call store dot slash header dot jsp f and copy paste the same thing for food and in between

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.970
.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.040
I'm gonna stay here.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.380
It's too product D days and the leaders of the product.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.870
I would like to display it,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:29.650
probably on the first half of the page so I can say here do because equals two room at two

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.170
columns so that they are occupying 50% of the screen.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.420
Do class equals to call copy the same thing as a second but dummy column.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.870
But in the first column,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.140
I'm gonna add a table slash table so it's a table class equals toe table without any other

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.990
original CSF classes.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.220
And here,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.940
a 30 body slash T body with multiple rows but only two columns.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.700
The 1st 1 is going to be,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.280
let's say,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.760
the name of the product,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.240
and the value for that is dollar pr dot product name.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.820
Let's copy and paste this rope multiple times for each of them.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.110
The 2nd 1 is going to be,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.560
Let's say,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.320
for example,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.250
category I remember.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.950
PR is a product that has a member variable called category,

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.200
which is self is and into the object.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.170
It has a category name meaning PR get category.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.590
Don't get category name.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.310
Let's also our supplier here,

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.690
and the supplier is also a member variable here supplier dot company named That's the

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.600
member variable.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.030
Apart from that,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.650
we also have you need to price Let's take your USD and then the unit price.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:05:03.360
And for this continued,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.610
let's display that as a yes or no.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:13.510
So that's just type your is continued as a question mark and I can see here discontinued is

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.090
equals to one.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.040
Then I can say here yes,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.660
are I can say no.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.240
So this way we are giving more user friendly or put instead of just one and zero.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.850
So let's save this start.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.350
Don't get once again,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.330
and once it is done.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.280
Let's go back toe the closer.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.450
Let's say fresh or click on all products.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.550
Now we see that they are all like hyperlinks.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.850
If I click on Chai,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.610
for example,

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.170
you should know.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.940
See the complete details off the product like this.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:53.470
You can also see that there is a product details as the you are question mark ID equals to

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.130
one as the quietest perimeter.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.470
So if I type here itself,

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.690
say,

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.350
for example,

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.490
66 and press enter,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.630
I should get the details of the product.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.530
66.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.190
It would be nice if I say product details for I D 66 because that's what actually I'm

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:14.930
looking for So I can go back to the browser here and then display something like Product

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.150
retails for Ivy and then say dollar.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:26.030
But I'm dot i d is a j s be implicit variable that I can access in the expression language

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.740
and ivy happens to be the request perimeter that has sent so and save this.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.650
Go back.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.260
Let's say,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.840
go back toe all products and then access some product randomly and you can see No,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.520
it is product details for I d tilting.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.100
These are the product detergents
