00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
in this video.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.660
Let us understand the working off http.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.690
Claimed seller communication as the name suggest there are two computers in order in a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.850
client's and communication number.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.090
One is the claim.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.760
So this is typically a broza on a bile application,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.950
but generally can call this as the http claimed.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.650
And out of the one is the server,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.370
which is nothing but a computer with some specialised software s so obviously to run a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.040
computer related operating system,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.940
for example,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.900
you may be using windows.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.700
I may be using Mac or someone else maybe using Kleenex and you might be running some server

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.200
software,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.750
is there?

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.830
That's a in article arguments all you may be having a my SQL all you may have.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.550
Let's say an Apache dunk it,

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.850
which is a website.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.170
Let's just call it s dunk it.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.440
Each of these are exposed by the operating system using some port numbers.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.720
For example,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.360
the pulled 15 to 1 is for Oracle.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.760
So any requests?

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.960
Why,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.140
at that port number would be redirected to Oracle?

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.490
Similarly,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:32.650
3306 is what is used by my SQL and a zero original is the port that is used by a dunk it,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.190
Of course,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.490
all these port numbers can be configured so you can go in any survival in any of the ports

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.590
that are available.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.290
Now.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.320
Tom can be a Web.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.940
Several can host multiple Web application.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.690
Each of application you deploy on that will occupy some space called as a context.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.360
A context will be access to using a your other such as,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.010
for example,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.650
that say,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.460
this one has a urine called one.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.760
There could be multiple application depart.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.020
Hence,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.450
there would be multiple contexts,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.280
so there could be at two at three Exeter,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.240
and in each app there will be resources such as satellites and GSPC.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.600
A salute is a job object that has a function typically called service but importantly,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.100
this summer,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.410
object is map to to a URA,

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.390
for example,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.750
slash Hello.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.040
So whenever the user makes a http request using a browser so they user may send a request,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:51.010
which is http colon double slash local host colon a zero exit slash one slash flu.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.280
So when such a request is sent by a client or a browser or a mobile,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.180
http,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.250
is the protocol,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.250
which is the language of communication between the client and the server.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.010
Local host year corresponds to the same computer where the crows it is running.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.100
It could be an I P address.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.750
It could be a name of a computer.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.980
Or it could be even a dog.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.550
My name,

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.150
which corresponds to a different idea just all together in the Internet.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.280
If the port number is not mentioned for http protocol the polled 80 is assumed as different

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.280
.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.410
But as in our case,

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.050
because it is not anything we have explicitly mentioned.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.030
So which is a jittery?

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:41.490
So the request from the client re just this particular poured once that is received by the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.510
operating system are pretty system Denville forward that dunk it because of the port number

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.510
.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.730
So Tomcat tresses the request,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.010
once the Tomcat uses it,

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.170
identifies using this particular slash AP one Partney to this context.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.470
And once that context is identified within that context,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.270
it checks.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.860
Is there any resource map to talk slash?

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.280
Hello.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.890
If the answer is yes,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.300
then it's going toe forward.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.150
That particular question that object.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.150
The object has a function called service.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.450
There are other millions that has to get do post Exeter,

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.180
the service function will receive a request.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.720
It processes the request.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.210
Such as,

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:22.080
for example,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.440
reads all the inputs sent by the client.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.780
Maybe perimeters or cookies,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.500
Headers.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.750
The request body itself usually takes the help off.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.050
Other objects suggest services and deal objects genders,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.940
and it's Deimel content and gives it back toe,

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.680
dunk it.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.620
Duncan then acts additional headers,

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.230
if any,

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.430
and then gives it toe the operating system are predict system then will give that response

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.470
back to the plane.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.970
So this is okay.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.650
Hits DTP request that is sent by the client is gonna get http response.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.380
The ex TTP request is a plain text to document that is sent wire the network whether point

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.040
and http response case Also a plain text,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.860
A document that is coming back from the serval which is processed by the client and the

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.240
city.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.370
The response body is what is shown to the end user
