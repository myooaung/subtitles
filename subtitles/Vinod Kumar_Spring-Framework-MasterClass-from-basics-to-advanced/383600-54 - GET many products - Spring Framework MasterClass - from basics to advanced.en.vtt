00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
in this video,

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.800
let us create a resource that can give different representations off a product.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.490
For that,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.420
let's create a new package called Cord Urbino.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.280
Dark web dot resources on under that,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.650
let's create a class called product Resource.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.250
So I'm gonna wreck click on anyone off these packages.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.770
New class that's called a does product resource.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.660
And let's change the package toe web dot resources Let's click,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.580
finish and write a function here that can produce a list off products.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.890
So let's call it as public list from job or a duty,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.230
which is going to be off type product from quarter in order entry That simply call it is

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.850
get all talks,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.750
and from here I want to return the list off all products for which I may want to make it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.090
off the deal or a service class if we have.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.790
So I'm located Variable called Deal or hitched video off type broader deal.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.650
So that's good part of deal deal.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.750
And let's not aware this so that by the time product resources created,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.870
we have access toe the hits TD will object,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.130
so we'll say auto White required equals two.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.750
False is not going to be used here.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.740
Now that I have this h DDO,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.050
I can simply say here,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.910
return HD dear would not get all products.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.600
This throws an exception.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.870
I'm gonna throw it away for them so that whoever is calling this in our case it's gonna be

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.950
spring is going to receive this.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.770
We'll also look into how 200 these exceptions and errors later.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.890
And now let's say I want this particular function to be in Ward when the u that makes a

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.750
request card slash ap slash products.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.990
In fact,

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.490
all the functions off this corresponds to the same resource.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.840
So let's annotate that over here.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.430
So I will say attended,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:10.570
request mapping and then say you're slash ap i slash products so slash AP is a convention

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.640
to indicate that this is a Web 80 so people can make use of this a p A and products is

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.700
something that I didn't defies this resource.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.740
Also,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.170
it is important to understand that the naming convention is it's plural,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.440
not singular because we have one or more resources off type products of recorded s products

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.440
.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.800
Now let's also honored it.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.790
This as at the raid controller for the time being,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.740
although in spring washing four onwards,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.120
we have something called arrest controller.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.540
We'll see what is actual problem with this.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.770
And then we will use the rest controller in a bit.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.930
And now we have to say that this particular function should rest form toe this Ural only if

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.200
the request is get to request so vigorous area again at the real request mapping.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.950
And then we say your method equals toe request matter Don't get so one small problem here

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.920
is that whenever there is a controller and they're the handler function,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.370
the 100 functions return type must be either a string representing the viewing all the type

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.720
called Model and View,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.870
which consists off model data as a list of yuning.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.060
And typically we have seen so far that the view name is a logical name that represents a

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.340
physical JSP file.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.410
We don't want this function to return a view name,

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.610
but instead we want this list off product itself to be represented in some format and to be

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.360
given toe the color.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.880
For that we have our one more an addition called Jared Response body.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.150
When you use a response body for a function,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.630
the return value is now taken and given to a different view.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.220
Result.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.850
In this case,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.730
the viewers are what is called contain negotiating view.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.350
Resolver.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.450
So what this does is it's going to check the request scope for what kind of content the

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.510
user is interested in because this is about representational state transfer.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.440
We want to see what kind of data the client wants.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.820
Is it an XML or Jason are any other format?

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.030
So the country negotiating view result were will check the request for a header called

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.120
Except on Sees.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.610
What is the mind type The user has specified.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:24.460
It could be application slash example obligations that Jason our dexter slash CS three

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.150
etcetera.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.300
Based on that,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.070
it takes the help of an A P I,

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.960
such as Jackson or Jack's B and converts the list off rodders in tow.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.900
Either Jason,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.180
our XML and sends it back.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.570
So this is how the list of product gets converted into X.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.900
Similar.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.450
Jason.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.340
One more thing we have to do before we run.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.930
That is,

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.560
we have toe add This particular package in the components can are we can actually say our

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.020
components can should scan everything within the weapon package so we can go to the app

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.650
conflict.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.800
Andi Probably change this to corner.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.950
We know Dark Web.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.240
Save this.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.010
So now we can break lickle Project ROrdonez Announcer Well,

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:14.710
so the output comes on the browser But for a better clarity we installed a tool called

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:23.050
Postman so you can goto Google and look for postman Download and you will get this Donald

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.950
Postman app earlier.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.710
This used to be a Google chrome extension.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.340
Now it is a separate app that you have to install.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.720
I already have downloaded and installed,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.750
So it's a straightforward procedure to download and install.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.850
I'm sure you will be able tow download install without any problem.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:48.180
Let me open Postman And the reason we used postman is because it allows us to create new

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.010
requests.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.750
We can specify different kinds off methods like get post for village.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.910
We can add additional headers,

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.090
quite distinct perimeters our traditions.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.840
When we're sending a post request,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.440
we can send the request body in different format and that is the reason post managed

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.960
reformers in the browser.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.930
We can only send the euro on all the Urals that you type in that just but will be

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.350
considered as a get request.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.510
So let's make a request to our resource,

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.010
which is nothing but this.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.990
Http.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.350
Local host Agent Joe Spring Embassy basic slash AP a stash product.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.540
So if I'm gonna take that over here,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:34.990
local host a zero federal slash spring that mbc that basics slash ap slash products Let's

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.330
say I want toe get Jason response.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.810
I can goto head Oh,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:48.030
and say that I want to accept a form it called application slash Jason and any additional

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.560
parameters if you want a consent.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.710
So this is to say that I'm interested in this particular format.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.170
So when I click on send here,

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.950
although I have here a handler for the same,

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:03.630
this handler should be able to produce all puts both in XML and Jason because I didn't

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.610
mention any specific type here.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.650
But let's give it a try and see what happens.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.930
So I'm asking for Jason when I click on send,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.620
it comes back with 500 internal server error.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.100
If you go to the review year,

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:22.820
you can see that it says no converter phone for return value off type job ordered you

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.010
tiller released.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.080
So it is that I don't know how to control an analyst into a Jason,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.320
and this is because when content negotiating,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.530
the result were is trying to look what kind of data the user wants.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:40.580
And it finds that it is applications that Jason this is the mime type it did not find any

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:47.870
AP Eyes are any job corps that can convert a Java objects such as an aerialist into a Jason

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.410
String.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:54.560
And hence it's giving another on the other is fixed by going toe mainland repository on

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:02.560
Look for Jackson and add Jackson data by Jackson Core and Jackson Animation to our

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.240
dependency.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.520
So I'm gonna open each one of them in separate tabs and copy the latest washing off the A.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.600
P s paste into our ponder XML,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.350
along with the list off other dependencies.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:23.620
Former and save it Onda.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.950
It should be downloaded in a couple of seconds.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.170
And now that the jar friends are ready,

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.150
let's restart or dunk it.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.770
And once the dunk it is ready,

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.520
we can go back to postman on,

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.210
then just a reason.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:45.550
The request and I should be able to see the list off products in a Jason format so it is

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.010
started.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.090
Let's go back to our postman.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:55.620
Send this once again on you can t know that we have got the list of products in a Jason

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.150
form it.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.020
So,

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:57.250
miss,

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:02.590
crawl up and you can see that this is an area here consisting off one product right here.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.200
So the on followed by a second product.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.150
Every product also has the supplier details as well as the category details.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:14.830
One of the problem is that if the picture is actually there,

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.600
then that will consist off junk characters.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.180
And if I don't want this picture to be part of my output,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.950
are any of these fields to be part of your foot?

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.040
You can go back to your entity class in all cases,

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.610
the category injury which contains the picture.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.540
So let's open the category and which of the field.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.010
You don't want Jason to be included.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.430
You can just say here at the rate,

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.140
Jason,

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.470
ignore on press control space over here to include the annotation.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:48.730
Save this Wait for sorrow to restart are you can probably restarted by yourself.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.110
If I go back to postmen,

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.350
send it now.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:57.060
Picture should not be part off the Jason or put on you can see that we have an a day off

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.760
products.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.250
Each product consists off supplier and category,

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.900
but,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.350
uh,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.300
category does not contain the actual picture.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.250
Object itself.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:06.990
Similarly,

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.140
in the product class,

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.680
I can say category idee and supply ready.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.690
I don't want it to be part of this because supplier hasn't supply ready.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.190
We cannot the Jason ignore for that as well.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.120
One other thing that we will see here now is that every function you know,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.780
product resource is going to be returning.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.330
The model date are directly so that it can be converted into a different representation.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.750
So accurate response body has to be given because if we don't give that,

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.660
then it will assume that this is the name off a view.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.030
So it'll assume that the two string off list off product is going to be considered a

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.850
logical Munim,

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.190
and it will trade the result for that view name.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.400
We don't want that so every function we should active response body.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.660
But starting from spring four onwards,
