00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
I have a file on my desktop called db script dot SQL.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.970
On this fight contains around 11 different tables with lots of data.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.230
We will be using some off those tables for our project.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.450
We want to import all the tables on records from this particular Davis Cup testicle on our

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.870
spring training database.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:26.890
The command for the same is run script from and then the parts to the particular file in

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.770
single courts.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.620
So it is under users we know.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.040
Come on,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.170
best stop and then it's db script dot SQL.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.670
Make sure that the parts to your file is appropriate and take the run button supposed toe

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.790
import 11 tables like this.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.560
I can clear the screen over here and then looking toe one of the table called products.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.110
Click on the products it is,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.430
selects stuff from products.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.500
Run that and you'll see that I have lots of products over here.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.430
And if I say you're select,

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.340
count off star from products from the same,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.550
you'll see that we have 77 products and this is what we want When we actually run our

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.360
application,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.310
we want to get the number of products as 77 in serve,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.900
100
