00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
Now that we have got a fair idea off house cream works,

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.460
let's go and look at some more aspects,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.960
such as dependency,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.750
injection,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.350
wiring manual.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.360
Worse is auto wiring and few other aspects.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.200
For this,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.700
let's implement the Jerry BC product You're with the actual jerry busy core,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.850
which means you have to connect to a database and get the later from database.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.760
If you already have other databases,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.200
such as my SQL or Post Chris,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.900
feel free to use the same thing.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.650
I want to use a database called Hitch to Database,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.420
which is a free.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.400
It's completely written in Charla,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.210
and it has few advantages,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.810
and this is very lightweight.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.250
Also,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.820
it can be an in memory database also,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.580
which means within the same Jeriome as your Java application.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.780
You can host a full fleshed Ali BMS,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.940
typically used for testing purposes,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.150
but it also can be used as a standalone database.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.370
Now,

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.760
today,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.010
at the time of recording,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.480
the washing happens to be one for 200.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.550
For some reason,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.260
this doesn't seem to work as a standalone server.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.350
It may require lots of configuration to be done,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.310
so I wouldn't be downloading it from here.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.930
but I will be using an older Western from May 1.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.500
Anyway.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.360
We need the job for our class spot because it also represents a type for chili busy driver

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.360
.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.580
So let's go close.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.150
All these files go to our palms,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.830
Alex Salmon,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.480
and add a dependency for H two and the H two dependency.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.410
Let's goto our May 1 central search for each to press enter and the 1st 1 that we get calm

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.460
their heads to databases and then say hedge,

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.660
too.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.360
So that's the one that we're looking for.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.030
And the latest portion that works properly for standalone more is this one dot for that 1

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.560
97 So I select this and then click on this to copy and then come back to my may well formed

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.240
or XML,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.480
based here for murdered by the same control shift F on Windows Command Shift F on Mac.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.460
Very importantly,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.760
the scope is limited to test here,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.670
but we want this to be used even for our regular shower program as well.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.200
So let's delete that bypassing command E on Mac control early on windows.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.380
Save this file and the dependency will be resort.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.560
You can see under my mail.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.110
Independence is I see Hitch toe 14197 Job now,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.460
literally.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.070
You can see where it is placed under your home directory.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.570
In my case slash users slash you know Come on,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.680
that's my home directory.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.510
There's a dart M two folder repository.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.340
The folder called com slash Hitched to database slash hitch to and that's nothing but your

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.920
group idea here on artifact 80 followed by the Washington information.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.860
So it is wondered for that 1 97 This file hosts many things such as it represents.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.620
A full fledged are PBMs.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.360
It also has a Web server and client so that we can interact with the database.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.200
And it is also a type for Jerry visit driver,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.330
which means that we will refer toa a driver class from within the same charge file itself

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.480
to start a church to database server.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.080
All you do is the right click on this file over here and then say,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.430
copy qualified names.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.870
It's actually going to copy this,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.870
enter part,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.600
and then goto terminal our command prompt,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.470
and then simply type Joe minus John and paste this enter part on windows.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.650
You can look at this violence simply double click this jar file that will also do.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.580
But this comment anywhere works.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.080
Let's press enter and you can see it actually starts a database server and comes up with

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.480
this.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.250
You I running a local host age.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.650
Throw it to the first thing that you had to change.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.950
Here is from the same sitting inside of generate kids toe embedded.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.280
That is what it is popularly known for.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.970
We want to use generate kids to server.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.750
So now we've become their standalone server.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.070
I can access it from any application that driver class remains.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.160
Same are hedge to driver.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.570
Let's keep an eye on this because we're gonna use this later.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:13.100
The GBC order has a protocol GBC that the claim protocol hitch to Poland Recipe is the

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.040
Sarah critical local host is the computer on which you have the sovereign me on.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.860
Then there is a tilde here,

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.840
so ignore that on.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.020
Then.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.130
There is this test,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.370
which is going to be the name off,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.890
baby.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.590
Now,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.450
since I want to create a new database for this particular training,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.530
I'm gonna call this US spring training.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.690
If this database exists already,

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.700
it's going to use that if the database is not there,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.030
it's going to create a new one.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.540
And it will also create a credential for this user name,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.090
as s,

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.550
a password is blank.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.490
So since you are creating a new database,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.270
we can give a different user name and different password.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.820
But I will be leaving this as it is.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.690
You can check if connection is succeeded by testing it on it says connection.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.500
Successful.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.960
You click on Connect.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.450
Since we are creating for the first time,

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.080
it connects and opens the database content.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.590
Right now,

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.350
we don't have anything over here,

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.030
but we can create our import data suggests tables and records.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.950
What it has done is it has created a new file with the name off the DB under your home

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.610
directory.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.850
So if I go to my home directory here,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.970
you'll see that this is my home directory,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:28.250
you know?

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.640
Come on and you can see that it has created a five year called Spring Dash Training Dot

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:40.810
envied or DB on This is the new database and every content that you create here that would

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.470
be added to this particular file which hits two is ableto open when it is required on

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.250
display the content over here
