00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.670
project.

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.300
Lemberg is a well,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.550
a baby that is supposed to be plugged into your clips are any other ideas that you're using

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.480
and Lombok helps us automatically.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.450
Gender getter centers on lots off pilot played courts that we may required to work with.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.110
To act is to our eclipse.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.210
Let's go toe May 1 repository and look for Lombok ender.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.670
Let's click the very 1st 1 and still like the latest version,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.020
which is wondered 18 10 and then copy this by clicking on it.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.140
Go back to our eclipse at to our project Differences control shift F or command shifted to

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.770
format.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.690
Save it.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.850
And if it's already not there,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.130
it's gonna download from the Net and stores that in our local M two repository here.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.430
Once this is done,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.500
copy this qualified name by right.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.950
Click on that and go toe a terminal or command front.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:04.500
I have to open a new tab over here and run the command Java miners job,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740
followed by the long ball job.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.630
This prince of age ey with scans your and our computer for prominent directories where

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.200
eclipse can be found and then it shows the list off clips that you have I have only one.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.930
Andi.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.490
In case if it is not phone,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.650
you can always go to the specified location.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.100
Andi,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.080
identify the eclipse Start I n I file.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.270
And that would be added over here too,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.430
if lumber has already been updated to your I.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.830
D.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.730
This symbol will also appear right next to this,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.050
but right now you can see that I don't have I had a click on install slash Update.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.960
Andi,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.730
it has done.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.170
Now,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.830
basically,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.100
what it has done is it has added an entry in the eclipsed are.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.410
So if I have to run this game,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.340
for example,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.550
you'll see that my eclipse right now has already been installed with Lombok,

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.900
so I don't have to do anything,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.550
so I quit installer.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.320
But this is only take effect if you close eclipse and open again.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.540
Now,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.740
do not click on file restart.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.600
That will not help.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.670
So you have toe close eclipse on open against I'm adequate.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.930
Eclipse say s and then open eclipse once more Once that eclipses completely quit.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.550
Let's open eclipse again.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.480
And this rich the content of eclipsed and I fresh.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.290
I'm opening my Spring Project folder My previous spring workspace is already this.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.450
I click on lunch.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.990
You won't see any difference here,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.160
but to see for our Lombok has done the job or not.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.970
Let's go to our jail BBC product dear,

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.580
which is under deal.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.930
Let's say we want to create a couple of variables here.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.060
So since we want to work with databases,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.780
we also may want to have some variables its create your five X string driver.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.850
Last name.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.910
That's a quiet benching.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.850
You are private string user and rustler.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.090
As you consider off four warnings here,

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.370
the warnings are there because these are private variables.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.080
We don't have any getters and set us.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.130
Obviously they are useless for an external application.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.490
If I look at this outline over here at this time,

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.750
you can see there are only four variables.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.740
But by going toe our class here and adding an animation called at the Raid getter Preston

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.050
Troll Space and you will see that I got on innovation from Lemberg Gator,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.310
Lombok instructs eclipse compiler toe add Get us for all the private variables,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.450
you can see that I already have get their functions over here,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.840
which is the standard getter functions.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.880
Likewise I can also say that the rate setter now we can see that I also have the centers

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.670
for all these.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.310
If I have one more really well here,

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.340
even for that variable.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.750
Also,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.680
you would be seeing those centers and getters.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.510
You can add constructors.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.120
For example,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.120
If I want a default constructor economics,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.650
they at the rate no are constructor.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.800
You see that?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.470
I got a no argument constructor.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.990
So we don't having toe,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.530
right?

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.700
Many lines.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.180
Of course.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.760
We already have ghettos.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.400
Set us and no argument,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.120
constructor.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.070
So this is the use off this fantastic tool called Lombok.
