00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
I know that in our application,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.660
spring has been set up as the less common look and feel is really let's go and get some

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.950
products from the database on display the same thing over here.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.050
For that,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.900
let us go be some of the fight from the previous project toe the current project.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.250
But before that,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.950
let me stop.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.180
Don't get other ways.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.110
It keeps restarting every time I add new fights.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.780
So let's expand the Spring Basics project under its RC Main Java.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.260
I have aspects in Aspects package.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.130
We have my customers Specter Job,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.110
which contains couple of functions,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.000
which may be useful,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.600
for example,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.350
the one that transforms all exceptions into the exception that is useful.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.310
So we need this.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.230
We also need our deal exception having attempted product deal and the product deal itself

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.800
the dummy product DOJ,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.380
BBC radio on Jerry be sitting pretty well.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.650
We would be using in this particular example so we can omit that off.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.200
And finally,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.530
we also need all the three into the classes that we have used in the previous example.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:16.640
So let's copy aspects deal on and entity I'm holding commander toe Select multiple on

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.450
windows for control and click on different packages to copy selectively.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.380
Then right click on,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.150
then say copy,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.940
Come back toe the spring Embassy Basics,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.430
Java resources,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.890
and you can click on this SRC main Java,

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.830
right click and save based.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.820
While everything have come.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.490
We don't need some of the files from here.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.520
DMIB Rodeo GBC product Dio GBC template Productive Again Abused Command and Click to select

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.560
unusual fights.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.150
Andi,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.950
right click.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.760
Do it.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.840
We don't need this anymore,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.680
So let's get it up.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.690
That one more thing that the ultimate is the resources jelly.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.260
Bc properties because it contains the jelly.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.560
Bc connectivity information I'm gonna again copy that and based under the resources off the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.550
current project.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.850
So let's right click and paste it.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.560
Now that we have all the fights needed.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.650
The configuration also needs some update.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.100
So if I open the APP conflict off the current project,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.910
we may have to add a couple of other packages here.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.890
Number one is called out,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.300
you know dot dio,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.550
So let's add it.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.720
And second is the as pixel.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.680
It's headquartered in order aspects.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.210
Apart from that,

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.830
we also need to copy couple off other functions from the previous upcountry in the previous

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.160
project,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.970
the latest upcountry Waas at Conflict four.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.230
Let's open the same.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.100
We need enable transaction management enable Aspect J.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.280
R.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.380
A proxy and the property source of three off these annotations I'm gonna copy that based

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.650
for were here and now let's go up a couple of functions.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.760
First of all,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.220
these values are read from the properties.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.230
While we need that,

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.220
we need the hybrid transaction manager.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.710
We need the data source.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.750
We don't need this Jerry busy template,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.320
though we need the local session Factory Bean Onda.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.330
We also need hibernate template.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.850
So let's copy based for here and this one.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.220
We can delete that from here now that are configured.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.610
Ready?

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.340
Let's see if we have any errors while running the project.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.230
So let's right click on our project.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:48.190
Run us on server and we got the output without any other.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.970
Let's see on the console if we have any other and we don't see any errors.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.630
Also,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.080
there is our dispatcher,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.340
several it and Haibin.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.520
It also has been initialized,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.310
which means our application is OK.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.190
In orderto get the products.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.140
Let's provide a button or a hyperlink over here that says Get all products.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.120
When I click on that,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.080
I want toe.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.450
See the list off products in a tabular form it over here.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.600
Soto are a hyperlink.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.810
Let's go to the header.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.920
Dodgy SPF.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.240
You can press command shift our our control shift,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.970
are on windows to open a resource and type header and you should be able to see that header

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.920
dirty SPF.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.100
Let's add a paragraph here and inside the paragraph.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.470
Let us a couple off links.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.500
A hatred equals toe.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.950
1st 1 Let's make it a point to the home page itself.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.570
Let's give it us home a pipe symbol.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.650
We can also are a CSS class here called Bt and Bt and iPhone link.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.820
This will actually formatted in a better way,

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.310
even though itself in the hyperlink with this adds an additional styling.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:07.930
Let's add one more by copying and pasting this called slash on products and let's just

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.880
display here on for us.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.120
We don't need the pipe at this time.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.550
Here,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.960
save this.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.510
If you go back to the Roeser,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.790
do every fresh.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.250
I should see a nice couple of hyperlinks over here.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.110
When I click on this,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.950
we will get a foreigner for because we don't have any controller that maps to this.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.130
So let's go back to our eclipse.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.850
Go to the controllers package.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.690
We have a hello controller.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.430
Let's add another one called product controller.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.850
Our product controller is gonna contain all operations corresponding to our product.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:49.270
So let's go to the class product controller Regular class.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.090
It is no need toe do any extends our implements.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.530
But here will say that there it controller and because off our components can to this

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.990
package this now gets automatically instance created.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.660
This can now have access toe all other beings in the container.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.720
One of the being is our hitch,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.120
Tedy,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.440
which is there in the deal package,

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.880
which is a five minute template product.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.520
Do you go so I can see your product,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.260
Dear Oh,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.170
which is the interface I can call it as hitch.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.210
Tierro are just deal.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.430
Hit studio would be better because that's the name we have given here.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.050
So tomorrow,

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.360
if there is another implementation of product,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.560
a war is loaded by name.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.890
It's goingto do a wiring,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.530
so that's better.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.550
So let's go here and declared as hitched video.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.870
Only thing is I have to say I did auto wild and this time I'm not going to say recorded

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.000
calls to falls because there is no other conflict.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.420
So let's go and add here a function public string Get all products and returns a view.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:03.890
So let's give the name of the US slash lab slash pages slash show products dark GSP.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.730
We're giving the physical file name here,

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.590
but subsequently real convert this into logical name and the view is always supposed to

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.270
resolve that logical name.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.540
Toe a physical name in order to get the leader from the baby.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.450
I can see your kids t deal dot Get all products.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.970
This throws an exception.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.710
Lets Chris command one.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.440
Andi,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.260
I throws declaration Windows users press control one and pressed Enter.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.940
So we got the list of products.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.200
If I ascend this to a variable here,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.370
this variable becomes a local variable.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.170
But if you remember,

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.710
a controller is supposed to store this in a scope.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.750
So the view have access to that.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.700
In the case of some bullets,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.090
we used its TDB salute request toe store.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.420
This and the Js fees had access to that,

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.700
so that was called request go.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.130
But since this product controller has no dependency on our cell Arabia,

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.650
we don't have the https alert request.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:00.810
However,

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:05.830
if spring in walks this you can ask spring toe given http salute.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.890
Request here by typing that variable.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:12.740
So spring knows that for a given request there than it's GDP Separate request optic and

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.200
that will be injected over here.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.280
However,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.010
instead of asking for a request object or session object,

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.260
what you can do is you can declare a reliable,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.700
off type modern.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.530
This is an interface,

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.920
an object off which will be given by spring,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:34.010
which is like a hash map where you can store all your model later and at the end,

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.290
will spring finished calling This string will collect this modern letter back on,

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.360
then stores all the modern little in the request scope itself.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:47.050
So this is the preferred away off doing even though you yourself can store it in the

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:47.820
request cope.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:53.150
Now that's told this very well list in the model so we can say model dot add attribute.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.250
The name of the activity can save products and the variable is list.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.010
And if you see as for his good practices,

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.220
concern The variable list is not serving any purpose.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.000
Apart from just collecting it and passing a door here instead,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.960
we can actually directly store it over here like this.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.770
So we don't need this line at all.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.550
So no,

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.330
what we have done,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:20.490
we have actually got the data from the database and we have stored it in the modern school

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:20.490
.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.030
And then we're going to have you.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.290
So this is the responsibility off a typical controller.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:31.570
The only thing that I have to do now is toe make sure that our all products link is going

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.450
toe in work.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:37.070
This particular function to do so you can say that it request mapping.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:44.590
You can say your method equals toe request method dot Get This is optional because by

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:45.010
default,

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.620
hyperlinks are get mattered.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.810
So if you don't mention this particular element,

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.370
then this can receive all kinds of requests,

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.890
even the post request.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.990
But I just want to say that only forget request.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.900
This is a handler.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.410
We can also say here part equals toe clash.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.530
All products.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.390
This is over here,

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.980
actually associating the hyperlink with this particular function.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.360
One last thing is we don't have this show products JCB in our pages,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.620
Let's go toe pages and create one file control products.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.170
So let's I click the pages.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.970
New JSP five.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.900
Let's call it as show products on the fourth thing is,

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:32.320
I'm gonna remove everything and added the victim percentage that include fine equals toe

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:40.120
doc slash heather dot jsp F Onda copy Paste the same thing and changes to footer.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.980
Let's also just display here.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.750
Dollar Forex.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.520
We know that products is there in the request.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.660
Go with displaying it directly,

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.770
although we want them to be displayed in a tabular format.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.650
Let's go back to our project,

00:10:54.650 --> 00:11:02.340
right click and then say Run us on server and we got this.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.560
And when I took on this all products,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.810
we should see some list off products over here being displayed and clicking on home.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.950
Let's see what happens.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.520
There seems to be some error.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.320
Let's say it is for not for for slash home.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.880
Let's go back to our head,

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.950
RJ SPF,

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.780
and it's not dark slash home.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.550
It's just dark slash Save this.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:27.050
Go back to the browser on Let's do a refresh ones,

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.530
making sure that this is going to correspond toe the home.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:35.350
Let's click on home on We're Back toe the home So all products and home.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:41.730
Now the last thing that we want to do here is to display this products in a nice format in

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:42.780
a tabular format.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.350
Right now,

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.450
it is displaying the to string off the list,

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.900
which contains two.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.800
String off each of the products.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.980
Let's go back to the show products starchy.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.540
SB,

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.100
Andi.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.940
Delete this one and then we want toe.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.670
Add a table that's here a in first.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.260
That's a huge,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.600
too list off all products that use a table class course,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.680
toe table,

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.410
table,

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.470
border on a table striped.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.680
These are the CSS classes from Bushe,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:18.450
which make the table look nice and it's at a D head and the body.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.330
The head is gonna continue.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.660
The header antibody convinced the data.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.100
So first the header.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.560
Let's a few columns did.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.140
This is the first row off the header on the only road we're gonna add.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.220
A D hedge will say your serial number.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.080
That's the 1st 1 Second one should be,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.420
Let's say,

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:42.120
the name of the product and 3rd 1 let's make price.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.490
So that's the unit price in U.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:44.760
S.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.350
Dollar,

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.770
So let's your slash ci hedge One more.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:53.670
Let's hear something called quantity for unit slash th.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:58.840
Now in orderto loop over this particular products we have in here,

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.390
we need toe use,

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.950
some kind off a programming mechanism,

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.640
and James fees by default has something called script.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.150
Let's where you can,

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.370
right the job accord itself,

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.900
which will be very cumbersome.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.680
And that's why we don't want to use that.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.810
It's an older washing off JSP,

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.330
whereas jsp 2.0 onwards,

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:23.230
you have something called JST l J still sent for JSP Standard tag library.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:28.150
There are a bunch of times you have a couple of John store bill apart and then you can

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.980
start using them now,

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.620
one of the way we have seen so far.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.470
Adding jobs to a project is by going toe palm dot xml.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.980
Adding some dependence is,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:37.960
But in this demo,

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:44.260
I want to show you another way of adding the jobs on this is done by going toe the Apache

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.730
Tomcat distribution for that that we have here on there.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.800
You can see there is a Web apps there,

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.050
then examples.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.940
There's a guy bindings live,

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.150
and it's easy to just over here.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.080
So these two jobs basically correspond to the tag,

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.200
lip specification and haggling implementation.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.300
And this implementation is from Apache.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:13.630
Copy these two files and come back toe eclipse and inside the Web in If you can create a

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:21.060
new folder called Lib and add any additional third party jobs over here by pasting it.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:26.310
And now these two files will be part off your build apart.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.350
So very far you can go to the job resources here,

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.440
and then you can see libraries.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.270
And ideally,

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.270
you should see the Web app libraries.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.450
But it is not showing in case if it is not showing.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:39.400
Like in my case,

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.450
you can go to the project properties,

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:45.750
go to the job bill pot on under libraries.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.130
Goto Add leg,

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:47.650
really,

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.250
and you should be having here something called the Bad Libraries.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:56.040
Click on next and finish and click on a plain clothes,

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.740
and I see I had the weather played.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.020
Duties were about.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.290
Libraries are nothing but the jobs that are added in weber.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:03.050
Enough lib.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.210
If you expand it,

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:09.920
you'll see that the tag lives are there most of the time that comes by default But in Gezi

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:09.920
,

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.260
if you run into a problem like I have,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.390
this is how you can add.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.270
So now let's go here toe this t body on.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.150
We need to use a tag called forage,

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.000
but in order to access the tax different over in these like Rees,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.090
you have tow one more director here called tag lib.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.160
As the name suggests,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:34.860
it is that tag lately and the tablet has to attribute your give Number one is the U R

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.350
equals two and if you wait for it second,

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:44.790
you should see a list off them on the one that we want to use is the Jsp Js steel core and

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:51.940
the prefix is the 2nd 1 to the perfect are losers toe differentiate between HTML tags on

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:59.110
the JSP attacks in the sadistic to fix a C C for core and we come down here Now I can say c

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.610
colon And if you wait for a sec off press controlled space,

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.410
you'll see that you get a lot off tights over here.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.570
So these types are defined by a logical name year.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:14.560
This is the logical name that corresponds to an XML file called the dearly where all the

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.550
bags have been defined.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.370
So I'm gonna just select this far.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:22.040
Each and that forage have a couple of attributes now,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.950
obviously the far each item in a collection.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.730
So what is the items?

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.650
So I can see your items equals toe dollar products.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:31.010
Now,

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:36.210
this is the variable are the attribute name that we gave in our product controller here

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.060
called products.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.670
And we're now saying that Hey,

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:44.730
I want to look over each of the products in our request cope and each one off them.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.040
I want to name it.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.680
I can say here what equals Toe P.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.020
So he will not represent one product at the time.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:57.860
And since P represents one product inside is now I can use a t R two D combination to

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.720
display the same.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.100
The 1st 1 we want is a serial number,

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:01.830
which is nothing,

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.310
but I can use the product ready over here.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.730
But that's not a serial number because in case,

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.150
if I'm doing a filter than serial numbers won't look like a serial number.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.390
So to get the index off the loop,

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.550
I can see your war status equals toe some variable.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.060
Let's call it US index.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.240
Now I have access to the index off the for loop,

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:28.000
and I can say index will start from zero again the index plus one to get the first serial

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.460
number.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.860
So let's add a tiara on slashed year.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:37.990
The 1st 2 TV is going to be our index plus one slash TV.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:44.170
And then I'd say TV the 2nd 1 is nothing but the product name off this particular product.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:47.770
So let's type your readers product name Now.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:53.130
This corresponds to the product name getter in our actual product,

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.520
da Java and in the product or job get to product.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.160
Name comes because we have a field called product name.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.590
So even though this looks like the field name but in jails B,

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.350
this is supposed to be get product named function.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:11.400
So let's copy this and based two more times this is gonna be our unit.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.260
Christ on this is quantity for unit.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.300
Save this and let's get s.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.770
Let's go back to the browser and refresh one's Onda.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:24.070
I see an Adam here,

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.030
the other says,

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:31.880
that cannot convert the loop tax support status toe a number.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.380
And that's because here this is not supposed to be a number,

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:41.010
but it is a status valuable and status has something called Index.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:46.530
So where to say Status Start index plus one So that safety's go back to the pros are

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.850
refreshed one more time,

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.600
and this time you can see we got the list of products very nicely done.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.510
One last thing that we will go in this demo is toe.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.650
Make sure that this comes from the controller rather than hard guarded.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.880
Let's go back to our Jsp here,

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.940
and we're gonna cut this from here.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.150
This hitch to and that's on here.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:11.760
A dollar beach tighter obviously dollars page title is supposed to be an attribute in a

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.590
request scope.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.040
We don't have one.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.960
That's why it is giving and other also.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.450
But in the product controller,

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.940
I can go and add another attribute like this.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:21.380
Modern,

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:27.960
not add attribute with the name called Vegetative on the Value is supposed to come from

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.250
here saying that list off all products.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.730
Now that we have here,

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.760
we should be able to get this started.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.610
And just to make sure that the title is coming from here,

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:40.530
that's just changes toe all products instead of get all products.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.690
That's right.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:50.920
Click on a project run as on server and we got the output.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.770
Home pages,

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.100
the spirits click on the all products,

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:59.780
and now we see that the title says all products because it's coming from controller.
