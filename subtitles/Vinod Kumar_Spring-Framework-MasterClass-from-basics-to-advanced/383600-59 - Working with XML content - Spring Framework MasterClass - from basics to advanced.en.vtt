00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.590
here is the response for a ta Slash products last 12 on except has applications like Jason

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.530
has its value.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.590
When I click on Send,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.340
we got this Jason Data Well,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.120
would xml So the mind tape,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.140
for example,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:22.480
is application slash examine If I send this now and I'm hoping that if I get an XML,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.820
you see that I got and enter the other says 406 not acceptable.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.220
That means the content negotiation is failing because there were is unable to produce the

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.430
XML content.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.430
But for Jason,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.920
it's working because we added the Jackson A B s in our bill,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.250
but and spring is ableto detect that and then give the output.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.800
For example,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.240
Spring tries to use Jack's be.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.190
However,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.680
we don't have to add any additional.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.910
Justo our bill part because Jax B.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.950
Is part off cordial itself,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.570
starting from Java Washington six hundreds to make this work as an author of the product

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.150
class,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.900
you should give the permission to jbm toe alot,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.590
a product objectivity serialised in XML form it since Jack's bees an official job,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.590
a standard luxury that needs your permission so that an object off a product loss can be

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.870
converted into an XML,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.300
just like how serialization works.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.410
So to do that,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.450
I have to go back toe my court.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.250
I'm gonna stop the dunk it for a minute.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.980
Go to the product,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.850
urge our under entity.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.170
This is the one that we're responding.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.520
The way you can specify that it has to be serialized is if you remember.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.770
We would say public class product implement,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.710
See realizable.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.760
But for example,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.580
serialization.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.360
You have energy this as at the raid XML root element.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.490
And now,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.520
magically,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.550
everything will work.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.930
However we have seen in the past that,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.660
for example,

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.140
for supply ready I don't want to include that in my output for Jason.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.680
We would probably say that it is at the rate Jason Negro on like that,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.650
for example,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.860
you will have to say that this is a transient.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.920
As for His excellency,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.110
realization is concerned.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.890
Typical Java.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.790
Your cereal addition.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.100
You would declare this using a cure called transient.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.250
Here we have an annotation called XML Transient.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.470
The same thing.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.950
I will also give it for category I d as the less If I go to the category class,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.640
we have a picture.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.460
Where were given.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.350
Jason Ignore,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.480
along with Alonso,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.360
gave that example transient,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.660
so that even in example,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.520
we don't want this to be output now that we have done,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.620
let's save this,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.990
go back toe,

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.950
dunk it and restart the same.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.320
And while it's restarting,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.380
let's send this request again and see if you get 200 with some XML content in it.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.460
So let's click send so you can see now that we got the product with category on the rest of

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.940
the regions,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.630
along with the supplier details in XML format.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.950
While this worked fine,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.650
how about getting the list off all the products so I can see your a p a slash products?

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.380
We thought the slash 12 and if I send this,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.210
I should be getting a list of products in an XML format,

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.050
and that's what I'm hoping for.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.450
But when I click on this end,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.950
you'll see that it comes back again with 406 not acceptable,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.250
and the reason for this is very simple,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.240
just like how product object was not serialized into XML because we did not have this

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.050
accurate XML told Element earlier.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.140
Likewise,

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.470
now in the product resource,

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.620
when you're actually asking for all the products were sending a list of products.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.510
Let's assume that it's and our ladies.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.630
So the laws that implements list off which an object is being returned over here does not

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.130
have activated XML dude element in its class definition.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.350
And since it is not our class,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.950
we cannot go on do any changes to that.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.100
So so solve this problem.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.970
Now we have to create another class,

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.040
which is a rapper,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.490
for the list on Return an object off that class instead of a list.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.000
So let's understand this.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.820
By creating such a class,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.430
let's go to the entity here and then say,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.260
New Java class and the claws name.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.720
I'm gonna call it US product list or any other name you want and then click on finish.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.250
This is my class.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.210
I can say that hit This can act as a XML root element like this That's also at a default.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.200
No argument,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.050
constructor.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.080
We'll also out here at the rate getter we had at the rec center,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.550
too,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.440
and let's create a member variable called products off listed types.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.450
So let's take your private list from Java Util.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.690
Product is our entity and let's call it US products.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.740
And because of the get a sitter,

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.610
we will have get a sitter for the same.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.130
This will be automatically exposed as an example element because the problem is only for

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.950
the root element,

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.100
not for the members.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.800
For example,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.070
if you see category doesn't have direct examine root element,

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.650
there was no problem in converting that into XML when it was part of the product,

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.250
because only for the root element that problem exists.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.720
So let's go to the product list now here.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.280
XML Root Element Automatically,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.870
Lincoln works this entire list in tow,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.490
and XML on the root element will have this as the tag.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.070
A name like product list.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.920
If you want to change,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.090
you can see here name Nichols to something else.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:33.350
Each element inside that will have products slash products representing one single product

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.350
.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.700
So to change its name,

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.740
we figure at the rate example element on.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.080
We give a different name to that saying it is that product,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.250
another products.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.150
So let's say this good our product resource.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.270
We see that it's a response entity off product lister type ability that say your response.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.420
Pentiti off product lift.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.750
That's import product list,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.950
and what we have to do is we're do create an object off product listed.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.340
Eight.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:13.210
So product list that's called appeal equals two new product list appeal dot set products

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.830
off this STD order.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.950
Get products and then we say here,

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.180
return response entity dot OK,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.560
and then supply the body,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.990
which is pl on and save this Restart.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.690
Dunk it.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.790
Let's go back toe postman,

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.350
Send the request again.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:40.450
So I got an editor at a 500 Internet service.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.540
Let's see what's the?

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.040
And also,

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.370
if I go to the preview here,

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.420
I see a readable error message.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.140
It says the class has two properties off the same name products.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.170
That's what actually it says.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.940
And I think it is in the product list if I go back over here.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.970
The actual problem is the name product slash product uses this variable.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.790
And because of this getter over here,

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.260
Jax be also traced to convert the get product into an XML element.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.020
And that is why we're getting the letter.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.390
If I had not given this name Nichols to product,

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.850
this problem wouldn't have come.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.450
But since I've given this and I want to read in this.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.670
So we have to tell Jax Be not to use anything other than the fields to convert into an XML

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.670
.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:27.190
And to do that I'll have to go is to say that the rate XML access er type on.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.460
Then we figure we want to use only the fields,

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.940
not properties.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.500
Properties means get us occurs on as a good practice that also coffee this on.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.950
Baste it in all our entities.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:43.540
That's one here on and go to the category.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:50.350
Let's also added that in the category and one in the supplier so that we don't run into

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.910
problems in the future.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.650
Let's save all the changes.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:54.230
Restart,

00:07:54.230 --> 00:08:00.550
dunk it and go back toe the postman click Send again.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.370
So we got the status as 200.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.460
We are seeing the preview because previous leaving their message was that we kicked on

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:07.840
preview.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.050
Let's click on Pretty,

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.710
and I can see that the product list That's the XML root element coming from product list

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:19.330
class on this is the modified examine element name for each of the product.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.660
We have this product slash product.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.280
If he had not given name Nichols to product,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.650
this would have been products slash products that the reason we're using that we may run

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.740
into one more issue.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.580
Let's try this.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:31.990
First,

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:37.420
let's get product and we'll say 12 get the details and we got the response.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.250
No problem.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.080
But if I say product 1 22 which doesn't exist now,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.730
there is gonna be a problem because now our function,

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:52.150
the handle function is going toe return a response in today off type map.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:57.190
Just like how the released did not have the Magdalene XML root element.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.650
The math implementation,

00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.400
like Hashmat,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.440
also doesn't have XML root element.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.650
So this will cause a problem now.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.700
So again,

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.580
the same error 406 not acceptable.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.060
So to solve this,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:14.140
we also have to have one more class for all these messages.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.330
So instead of man,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.670
we have to have a class that represents an error object.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.960
Probably I can call this as a response on.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.200
Then,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.120
instead of a map,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.950
I have the construct that and then send it across.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.320
So that's going to be applied for very what I've used map.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.460
So let's go and create one more entity class here.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:41.640
Let's call this as Ed in restaurants and that's just a regular Gela plus no need to do

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.760
anything addition.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.450
We only have to probably members in that one is gonna be called message.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:54.250
And that's the message that we want to use for sending the 2nd 1 would be probably a data

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:59.700
associated with the error message such as the product probably are the idea,

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.100
etcetera,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.450
So we'll call it as data.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.530
Generic name.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.950
This is supposed to be a string type.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.900
This is supposed to be off object.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.150
I'd onda.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:16.150
Now let's are here at the red No are constructor at the rate getter at the center,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:25.950
and we'll also at the Red XML root element on one important like previously done at the

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.750
example Access er type.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.350
It's only going to work with feels,

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.710
and that's important.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.090
And now that we have the other response class,

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:39.110
let's go to the product resource and see if we can convert this into an era response.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.840
So what I have to do is I say,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:49.820
first response equals toe new a response years or set message to there's no product form.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.750
That's the message.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.190
And then within a year,

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.720
Doc said,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.300
data toe the I D that the product I d.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.750
And incidents sending the map here,

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.080
we're gonna say you're here.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.220
So the same thing,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.650
Probably.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.550
I can copy and paste in couple of other places.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.550
For example,

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.210
if I scroll down here,

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.450
we have one more here.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.750
That data is gonna be PR on messages.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.960
The Eder get Mrs.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.440
So let's make this changes.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.980
So I'm gonna copy this Based over here,

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:23.810
that's the message.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.550
Part on BR is the actual object instead of ivy.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:32.880
And we don't have this map requirement and this is not required because we already have

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.950
given over here.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.080
So one more place,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.540
probably.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.660
Here we have exactly same thing.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.850
I can copy these four lines.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.150
Onda based it.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.900
One thing is that it's supposed to be Internets or whatever.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.470
Not former four.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.720
So I'm gonna change this toe.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.350
Internal server error.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:56.170
Same thing I'm gonna copy and based even were also on one other place,

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.350
I think is here where we're having a no product phone.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:10.750
This is former for I can copy this from you're come down toe this location based it.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.230
But I fought this one.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.760
We're having a message.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.970
We're gonna copy it this one and paste or here.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:24.740
We don't have the product of dick toe so we can remove this one on.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.980
Our application now is ready.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.540
Let's save all the files.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.320
Goto,

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.310
dunk it a restart our server on now the surgery.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.650
30.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.230
Let's go and send the request,

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.920
so I'm gonna send it for non existing data.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.050
So let's send it.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.280
And we got another response messages.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:43.980
No product,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.810
and there is a 1 22 But if I say that I wanted in the Jason former,

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:54.070
it still should work because any object can be converted into Jason without any problem.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.660
Same as earlier.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.650
If I'm getting a list off all products as Jason,

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.550
we are able to get that.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.960
So get a product seven and we have the array of products over here.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.500
We also checked out,

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.450
for example,

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:09.240
let's give it a try.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.090
Once more,

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.320
click on send,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.050
we get a neck simulator as well.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.370
One last thing is,

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:19.420
if you want to be specific about what kind of content that this can produce as well as

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.220
consume in the request mapping,

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.850
you can always say that hit dysfunction could use us.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.710
XML and Jason.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:32.630
We add another element over here saying that producers equals toe an array off line types.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:41.190
You can say Here it is applications slash Jason as well as application slash xml The second

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.700
copy and paste for all the get methods.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.280
For example,

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:50.470
even over here another one Is this where I'm tryingto either product.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.350
So since this is our the user is also sending some data.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.100
We are also returning some kind of response entities.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.930
So while producers determine what kind of responses are given to the user,

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:06.670
what kind of request body can be sent from the user can also be restricted by using

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.550
something called Consumes.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:16.690
Someone out here consumes and produces will not take it off the except head Oh,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.900
and consumes will take her off the content type header.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:29.700
The same thing goes with updates on a copy and business for update Onda delete off course

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:29.890
deal.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.160
It doesn't consume anything.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.870
It's only going to produce a result.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.050
So we don't need this part over there.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.240
And with this,

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.950
our product resource is completely really
