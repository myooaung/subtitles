00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
just we're creating a hibernate transaction manager is not enough.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.850
There are two more things that we have to do.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.010
Number one,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.540
we need toe goto our product deal.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.420
That's first command shift on toe open the resource are controlled ships are on Windows by

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.560
product Dio and then select that you know,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.150
programs were actually using a variable of this stereotype and calling all these functions

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.350
Whenever we want to call the our product update product our delivered product,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.670
we want to ensure that there is a veritable transaction.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.950
The rest of them are just really only transactions.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.910
So say that these are right about transactions.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.430
You can add the annotation at the function level.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.220
Are the annotation correspond to the entire class?

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.190
You can also do the same thing here,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.170
for example,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.840
that are here at the transactional and you press controlled space.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.090
You get to off them.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.760
The one that we want is from our spring framework transaction,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.050
not from Java X transaction.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.110
So this one has a couple of elements.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.400
Number one element is rolled back.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.600
For this is a collection or an array off all the exception pluses that hibernate production

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.160
managers should roll back the transaction.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.970
The only thing that we have to do here used to,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.360
say,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.830
Diego exception dot class.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.350
What it means is whenever any of these functions throw a dollar exception,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.050
roll back the current transaction.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.240
The thickened element is read only equals toe,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.580
true or false.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.020
Let's make it as true because majority of the functions in this particular interface are

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.380
read only transactions.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.410
However,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.860
we want toe allred this particular element for specific functions like add update and

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.350
delete it.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.170
Let's do the same thing by adding an addition here at the red Transactional on.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.620
Then I read only equals toe false.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.230
Let's copy the same thing.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.390
Pasted toe the update function as a less the delayed function.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.470
So hibernate Transaction Manager is ready on our deal into face has been told that the

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.550
functions I'm product update product and dairy products are right about transactions.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.150
The only thing that we have to do now is to set up the table before transaction management

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.150
.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.920
This can be done by going to the APP Conflict four and then add in an addition called at

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.380
the rate enable transaction management save this and go back to the program.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.490
When I execute this core,

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.450
you will see that this is supposed to update the product price.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.050
Currently,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.900
the product price,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.360
I believe,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.490
is $22.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.540
Let's go and check it out.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.580
In the DB Select Star from Products,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.280
the product number one has $22.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.440
Let's go back here,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.440
executive this.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.980
Hopefully there is no better as you can see that there was no exception Message.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.220
Let's go back here really under a skilled select statement and you can see that the unit

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.950
price has increased to $23 from $22.
