00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.570
Now let's convert this textbook for discontinued as a pair of resemblance.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.520
Let's goto our project.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.090
Stop!

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.750
Dunk it!

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.030
OK,

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.790
it's running.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.190
Go to the farm,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.350
which is right here.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.810
And the last field here is the text box that we have got.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.980
Let's remove that,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.900
then provide a self colon radio and then specify that I want there really wouldn or is

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.670
continued.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.230
That's the name that I want a copy and paste over here.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.380
So this becomes automatically the i.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.940
D and name for this.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.170
Really,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.580
Burton,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.590
we'll also see your value equals to one.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.100
This is gonna be for one of the really but in on,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.560
like was.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.970
I'm gonna give the same thing for another one with zero as the value,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.010
you can also give a label for this.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.170
But what I do is I'm gonna use a separate label.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.010
So I hear a label,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.390
Doug,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.360
let me collapse this.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.420
Let's add a label slash level and this label is going to be a surrounding one of the really

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.530
button so that the label,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.370
when we click on it's gonna highlight that radio with them.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.310
So there's gonna be a small circle with the dot and then I'm gonna type your Yes.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.640
And another label here for the no,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.010
Really.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.110
Wouldn't will.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.520
Are this label?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.140
No.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.280
After the radio button itself.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.650
So we have a really wouldn't for s We have a really Britain for No.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.100
Let's save this.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.890
Start the dong get and refresh the browser page What we're seeing or there So let's go back

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.800
to the browser.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.440
Refresh on.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.600
Now I should see discontinued with the to read Evidence s and no,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.160
If I click on s here,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.180
you can see that's actually selected because we kept it inside the label.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.340
When I click on no,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.210
here you can see that the no has been selected.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.880
Also,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.580
when we click on the submit button,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.970
the values corresponding to this really bottles,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.750
which is one and zero,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.790
will be sent along with the rest of the values just to check the same.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.100
That's at a record.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.210
Let's type called coffee category and supplier.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.690
Anyway,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.820
it's gonna be none,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.750
so we'll fix this later.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.380
You need price.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.670
Let's say,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.740
for example,

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.580
$12 back off.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.180
One units in stock.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.840
Let's 802 units on.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.270
Other is zero reorder level.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.640
Let's say,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.410
for example,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.840
five Let's have for the time being I want to say no here because I just want to check that

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.540
it's going to be discontinued.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.060
If I say yes,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.420
it should be sent us one.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.140
Let's give it as no click on submit changes and now you can see when it comes back

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.050
discontinued.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.280
It says no,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.500
because that's my choice.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.100
Earlier,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.390
we can also go back toe.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.070
It's to console Onda.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.460
Read on this quality of the product 79 you can see discontinued.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.050
The value is zero.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.160
So we're able to use read evidence for a toggle values such as s and no.
