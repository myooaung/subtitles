X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
While I'm able to get the list off,

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.260
all products are a bunch off them.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.600
Let's say I want to get a single product.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.110
Of course,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.550
the single product I want is based on the product I d.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.370
So the product ready can be supplied in the Ural in couple of different ways.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.140
Number one.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.130
I can type your question mark.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.480
I d equals toe say,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.110
for example,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.620
12.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.590
So this is called as a quiet listing perimeter,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.550
while this is perfectly alright.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.020
But supposing for wonder supplier for this particular idee Dinello to come up with a

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.140
different Ural,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.620
whereas the preferred method is something like product slash 12.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.800
So this would be a single product whose idea is supposed to be 12.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.820
Are the primary care really supposed to be 12?

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.230
But with this now,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.350
the same mural can be extended to say,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.650
Hey,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.710
give me the category information related toe,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.610
The product 12.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.770
So if you look at that,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.270
it is there's a list of products.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.160
I want a single product out of the 12 but within the product,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.540
well,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.870
I have a category.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.530
I want that particular category.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.310
You can even go and say No,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.150
I want all of the products within that particular category,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.630
so you can see that I'm Natalie.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.030
Don't toe a different kind of resources using the U.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.350
N.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.630
And that is why we follow the perimeter,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.610
such as this 12 or category,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.860
or products as part of the part instead of supplying it like aquatic string.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.090
So in this case,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.410
I want to supply this 12 as what is called as a part variable on another way off.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.220
Sending this 12 would be toe Adan http,

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.740
header over here on,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.980
then receive it as a hedge.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.390
Http,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.680
header in the controller handler function.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.630
So at this time,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.480
if I make a request,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.200
it's gonna come back with for not for because I don't have a Europe mapping toe slash ap a

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.660
slash products and slash something over here.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.990
This could be 12 20.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.560
Whatever.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.820
We don't have that.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.310
So let's go back to our core.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.060
Stop this error for a while and write another handler over here.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.550
Let's make some room and then add another 100 over here public.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.450
This time I want a single product.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.520
Let's call it as get product by idee.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.730
And let's also say I am supposed to receive an indigent idee and then I can see your return

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.730
.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.520
HDD would not get product with the idea that I have got on this throws an exception.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.740
Let's throw it away for them.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.630
But how do we map this right by default?

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.110
Dysfunction is also map to slash ap a stash products.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.350
But to say that this is an extension of this request mapping you can simply come here and

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.120
say factory request mapping and then they fought equals toe slash.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.950
So it is an extension on slash ap slash products slash But if I take your I need something

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.600
like this,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.130
then it is considered like a hardcore did value like slash ap A or stash products this

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.250
ultra stashed Heidi.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.340
But in our case,

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.950
this part is something that is variable.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.060
So to indicate that this is a place holder in our request mapping,

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.140
you simply have to say curly bracket.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.350
I d like this.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.060
This can be any name.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.730
Your choice.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.140
It doesn't matter what is this?

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.020
But this has to be no matter to my variable and say that a in the part there is a variable

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.840
called idee.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.730
So we say you're at the rate fought very event on whose variable name is idea.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.250
So this is I D.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.940
If this name matches with this variable,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.460
this part is optional,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.650
so you don't have to give it.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.410
Let's save this Now.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.640
Our new handler function is ready in just one line.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.760
So let's go start the dunk it server.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.850
Let's go back to the postman.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.630
Send a request for slash AP a slash broke slash troll.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.850
When I click on Sen,

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.850
I should get a Jason or put for that particular product.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.350
You can see that I got a single product now,

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.490
and the single product has all the information,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.260
like supplier and category.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.430
And if I want to send a different one into love 12 letter,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.220
for example,

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.750
I can say 56.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.310
Send it on.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.260
I got the product agents whose idea is 56 and let's try one more.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.590
Let's try here something like 34 send it and I got the response as well.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.930
But suppose I send an idea here,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.320
which is non existing Letter 349.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.940
I have only product from 1 to 77.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.390
Probably.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.650
I added a few more,

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.070
but 3 49 is an invalid.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.720
Productivity on I will be actually aren't getting any output.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.670
But I could consent.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:38.170
You can see that it comes back with status 200 but there is no response now in the concept

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.030
of rest.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.750
We want to say that this particular resource is not found by sending a response status off

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.770
for not for because this is invalid.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:47.820
To do that,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.070
you can go back over here.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.560
Let's stop the server for a while.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.490
This is where you collect the return value from this particular function and conditionally

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.960
written response.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.950
Since their response status changes based on the return value of dysfunction.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.140
Let's change this from product toe What we call us.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.740
The response entity.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.250
This is a class from aren't spring three more kids DTP package.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.350
We said that it's a response interdict that can produce.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.060
If you don't know,

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.230
you can say question Mark.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.430
For example,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.700
if you want to give a response with the on Jason message saying that the data for this is

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.340
not phone,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.690
you can actually responded with a map.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.290
But this time I just want to say either a product or no product.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.040
I'm gonna say here,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.980
product and let's has ended.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.120
Eight.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.580
Studio ordered Get product to a variable car PR on a clear that appear to be off product

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.860
type.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.700
We take your if PR equals two.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:48.370
Now we need toe return a response course status is for not for you can see your return

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.900
response entity don't and you can see that there are different functions.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.810
One of the function most popular is not phone.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.360
If you'll select this,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.250
that is equal it off responding with four,

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.990
not four,

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.540
and then you have to call her the builder function so that actual response entity is being

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.020
created on Britain.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.100
And in case if PR is not equals TUNEL,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.270
then I can come down here and then they return the response entity dot OK,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.600
and then supply the PR because okay,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.040
corresponds to 200.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.660
And PR is our response body that we want to send on automatically to convert that into

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.740
Jason because the client is asking for Jason.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.940
So let's save this.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.050
They start drunkard and go back to a postman.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:45.060
And now if I say 3 49 it's gonna come back with for not for because we are responding with

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.540
for not for You can also respond with some methods saying that it is not formed.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.830
I'll show that in a minute.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.050
But if I say here No,

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.390
it is just say 44 which is phone.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.650
I will be able to get the actual data corresponding toe product ready 44.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.230
So,

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.490
in case off the data not found.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.450
If you want to send a message,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.700
you may have toe add an entity also along with that.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.580
But that entity has to be product.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.080
So since it is not a product in this case,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.550
you can say your question mark to indicate that I don't know what kind of response I make

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:23.760
you that scared a variable off type math map from you till a key is gonna be a string value

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.590
is gonna be object or it could be strangled.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.520
So if you're only talking,

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.650
would messages and then let's get a M new hash map.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.900
Let's put some key value pairs there with a m dot Put on,

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:45.650
then say the key here is that a message on value for that is no product phoned on.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.620
You can also say,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.700
here m dot put product ivy.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.290
That's the one that we want to give it as an object.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.630
The user supplied me an object and giving the object back.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.610
And now toe,

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.430
make it off this map.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:04.550
Let's return a new response entity object with their new response entity,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.150
and you can see that we can supply the body as well as the http status.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.550
The body is nothing but doesn't map and status is nothing,

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.650
but it's City Bay Staters don't not found on.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:17.430
That's basically,

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.690
like,

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:24.540
equal and off for not for on just have to remove this Dee saying that the object can return

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.310
a different type all ultimately,

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.550
you can also say here it is returning a map object like this.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.460
That's a lengthy way of doing so.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.870
I'm just going toe remove that.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.860
So this is also automatically going to take it from here.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.210
So now that our response entity is ready,

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.710
let's go save your files.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:46.320
Start Tomcat again and go back to the postman.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:56.230
Send this 444 again and you can see we got the footnote for as status as well as we got a

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.840
response.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.430
Body that consists off product ready for for four messages,

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.440
no product phone.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.530
So This is how you can respond with the different state of scored other than 200 as well as

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.250
with a custom body.
