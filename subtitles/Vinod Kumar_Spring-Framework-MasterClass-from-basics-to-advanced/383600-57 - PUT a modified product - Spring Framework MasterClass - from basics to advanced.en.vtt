00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
If you want to modify a resource,

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.790
we send a put request in stuff post.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.370
Also,

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.950
we indicate what is the idea of the product that we are actually going toe modify.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.340
And then we supply the modified Washington the resource that may even contain the product

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.550
ready.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.650
But we're gonna ignore that in case of product really already exists.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.150
But the rest of the needles should be updated or should replace the existing resource.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.190
So,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.920
essentially,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.750
if I have got this date on your that's a copy this on.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.150
Imagine this is the body that I'm sending,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.590
but we're only interested in updating the product resource as well as probably supplied it

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.590
.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.600
It's also in case if you want to modify,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.820
so we'll be changing this toe put request.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.160
But we also have to say here a p a slash products slash 85.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.550
So we're gonna ignore this particular entry,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.450
but we will update this product 85 with the rest of the leaders.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.670
So to write a handler for this,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.970
let's go back toe clips.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.070
Stop this terrible for a minute and then come back.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.290
You're on right.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:14.250
A function called public request entity off Oshima and then we say your update product.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.410
That's the handler.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.680
Once again,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.820
we're gonna write two parameters here.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.760
One is the in teacher I d.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.300
That corresponds toe this 85 that were supplying.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.230
And then we're also receiving a request body,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.690
which is gonna be converted into a product object.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.780
It's called SPR,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:41.010
and the innovations go like a dreaded request mapping method equals toe request method dot

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.810
port.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.350
And then we will say you're that this is supposed to come from a part variable called idee

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.350
.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.950
So we haven't received any part valuable because by default this maps to slash ap a slash

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.710
products.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.350
We also have to say that this is supposed to receive an ideas so we can say you're part

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.840
equals toe slash in calibrated some variable.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.950
This is a placeholder idee.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.550
Map it to this by tapping attended but variable.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.650
And this one is gonna be a valid request body.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.520
So let's right inside the function we are going toe pretty much copy paste the same thing

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.350
over here.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.690
But instead of that product,

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.100
we're gonna actually call hits todo dot update product off PR.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.250
But to ensure that the product 80 off This is ignored and the product ready off.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.170
This is taken.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.820
So we're going to say here peered are set product idea off i d.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.540
So basically,

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.190
we are overrating The idea that is only there in peer are in case if PR didn't have an idea

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.880
setting that over here and I believe there was a type of here It is not a question today.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.980
It's supposed to be restaurants entity,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.890
So I'm gonna copy Paste that over here on now.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.490
My function is pretty much ready so we can go and tested out by restarting the server on

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.920
going toe off postmen and sending the put request.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.630
So let's go back over here.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.110
I already got this.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.270
Let's say the product.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.710
80 85 hour changes from mozzarella cheese toe.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.980
Say,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.770
for example,

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.850
shadow cheese.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.540
And I'm gonna keep all of them as it is.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.840
Maybe the price from $38 to,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.150
let's say,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.750
for example,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.260
it's $27 units in stock say,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.910
for example,

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.170
we have 100 off them.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.880
10 off them on order.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.480
Onda reorder level is fine.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.170
Let's make this change.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.600
Andi,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.180
send this while put request toe 85.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.740
Even if this is something else.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.510
That doesn't matter because product ideas taken from the part variable not from the product

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.150
object itself.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.300
Let's click,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.540
send and see if you are able to get the result so you can see that we got the response back

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.540
.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.550
85 is the product Shadow cheese.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.100
And if I come down here,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.050
the unit place has been changed.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.790
Units in stock is changed.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.100
Units on order is also changed as well as reorder level.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.580
Now,

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.980
let's also go back to the DB and verify the same thing.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.650
So I'm gonna go back over here.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.650
Select start from products.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.300
Well,

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.020
product underscore I d equals toe 85.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.480
Andi,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.220
control,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.340
enter will give the result and you can see that we change the name.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.010
And then,

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.360
of course,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.930
the unit price units in stock units on order.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.240
Realtor level on discontinued.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.480
So this also have been updated now,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.450
had we modified the supplier name,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.170
for example,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.910
that might not have updated.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.230
That's primarily because in our product dot Java,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.670
we are having a many to one relationship for supplier,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.210
so modifying the product will not modify the supplier.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.510
If you want that to happen,

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.190
then you have are the cascade option here called cascaded type,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:08.140
and then say here dot You can say you're either march are persist or all better specify to

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.730
off them at least much and persist.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.520
You don't want to really do every move because deleting a product will try to delete a

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.390
supplier which we don't want to do.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:23.320
So we're gonna say you're much as the last gas gift dot but cyst.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.520
This is how you can tell that when a product is modified a supplier.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.750
If,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.990
in case if it has changed,

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.340
you also have to change the supplier and the likewise you can answer to the same thing for

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.800
the category.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.700
Over here on the savior,

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.300
cored,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.470
Go back toe,

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.770
Tom,

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.080
Kurt,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.550
restart the server,

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.450
Wait for dunk it to restart.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.220
Come back to Postman.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.990
So this time,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.310
when we're sending the data,

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:53.280
let's change the product unit price from 27 to 30 as well as we will add some entry to the

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.060
description here,

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.630
saying that milk called cheeses,

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.810
etcetera on a supplier.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.220
Of course,

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.960
what we'll do is we'll give the same number as the fax number,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.550
copy and paste over here.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.710
And if I send this now the unit place for the product description for category fax for the

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.330
supplier.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.490
Muster change.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.230
So let's hope that's gonna work in Click on Send and it has been sent.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.310
Let's go very for that.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.100
Over here,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.950
you can see that new fax number has been updated to supplier.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.400
New description has been updated to category on the unit.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.100
Price is also updated.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.350
Toe the product,

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.970
So that's very for the same Category four Supplier five in the DB So I'm are here.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.850
Select start from suppliers.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:51.510
We're supplier Underscore D equals toe fight Select Start from categories on and a

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:57.290
condition with category Underscore I d equals 24 Let's press control.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.040
Enter and see all the three of them.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.050
Agency That description has been updated.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.250
Sacks has been updated on unit place has been updated
