WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
know that our application is up and running.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.050
Let's look at some other scenarios.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.150
I'm right now on the home beach.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.110
I should be able to get the list off all products.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.350
I should be able to click on a particular product to see the details.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.920
I should be able to click on the edit to Lord all the details on the HTML form.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.620
I should also be able to click on add product on from the job.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.820
Done.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.050
I should be able to select an appropriate category.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.950
Our supplier.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.660
All these are fine,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.120
but there are few corner cases.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.320
Tortures number one.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.770
What if I type something here that is not available?

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.460
For example,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.050
if I type you're a SDF and then press enter,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.940
you see that we got another page,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.470
which is understandable.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.750
But they're paid itself is produced by Apache Tomcat and not by my application,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.750
and the look and feel of that is not matching with our application.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.500
Another said situation is when there is a server side error,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.770
for example,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.860
the DB connection has been closed off.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.650
There is a transactional error.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.870
Some exception has been thrown on the server side.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.960
We will get a heads to DP Status 500.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.320
Let's take an example.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.420
If I go back to my homepage,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.450
I'm able to see all the products.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.500
However,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.660
if I go and stop my database server on,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:22.050
then if I go back toe a particular link that needs toe access data from database like this

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.050
,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.450
you'll see that we get an exception and it results in.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.330
Http status.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.940
500 Internet Sarah error And somewhere it's going to say that unable to acquire legitimacy

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.160
connection that's the reason why we're getting another again.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.790
You can see that the exception itself is printed from Tomcat,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.320
and the look and feel of this doesn't match our application.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.230
So when such sorrow said Aero State Place,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.070
generally there a couple of things that we would like to do Number one made in the look and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.780
feel off your application common toe the rest of the application number two to lock the

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.190
other details in a locker so that in the future,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.710
if there's a developer who got etiquette toe,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.250
find out what's the problem here?

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.940
She can go and check the details of the others to do that.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.670
Let's go back to our application Stop dunk it for a while and open palm dot xml because we

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.910
have to add a couple of dependence is if you want to use locker the longer service that

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.370
we're gonna use years from S L.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.080
A 40.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.490
So let's go toe May 1 depository.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.480
Look for a seller for GE.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.450
Take the 1st 1 which is a seller for J A p A.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.710
Select the leader stable Copy that Come back toe ponder XML and based in the list of

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.550
differences.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.050
Another one is the Acela for J Support for Java are Djelic.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.790
And if I scroll down here,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.710
you should see that there is a seller for J for Jellicle 40.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.410
Even though this is for Jerrick affording it supports what,

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.680
Jerry K eight Also,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.870
let's select the same.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.060
Copy that and then come back to our dependency lists.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.640
Make sure that the scope is not just the test,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.000
because we're also going to use this in our applications.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.120
So I'm gonna format this and save on the latest washings off.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.360
The jobs are downloaded from the net.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.450
Now the next thing that we want to do is tow handle These exceptions,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.550
handling such starboard side errors is a common problem,

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.350
and Java E itself provides out of the box support for this.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.730
Although we are more invested in the spring framework,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.310
let's have a look at how Joe R.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.040
E Address is the same for this.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.330
We have to goto web dot xml file,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.680
which is under the lab in a folder,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.470
and you can go here and at a tag here called ph slash better Pidge.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.980
Basically,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.500
we want to redirect the user to an error page.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.750
But the other itself can be caused because off two issues.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.200
Number one.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.980
If you know what the other courts,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.560
such as four,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.820
not four or 500 you can use that.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.590
So the time here is that error court,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.510
Let's say for not full and then I can say your location is slash Web in f slash pages slash

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.850
letter,

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.550
for example.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.050
Page not phone Dr USP,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.750
and this is supposed to be The file that tells you is that that hey,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.540
you reach a base that doesn't exist on check out some other options.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.250
We don't have this.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.650
Fine.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.350
Let's create one in a minute.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.660
The other option that you can do is you can clear another page and say that the exception

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.740
type is java dot langert exception all you can be more specific and say cornered we know

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.750
dot gov or dot deal with exception.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.130
And then again,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:47.880
you can say location slash Robaina slash pages slash er jsp Once again,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.780
this is a page that doesn't exist.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.180
Soviet appeared one for this also.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.150
Let's go and clear.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.410
Put the pages be enough dot jsp for page not found.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.350
So I'm gonna create a new file under pages.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:08.040
Call it us be enough dot jsp And to bring the common look and feel we're gonna say

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.550
percentage at the rate include filing call store dot slash headed R J SPF,

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.540
and close the same.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.650
Give a similar 14 footer.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.910
And in between I can tell the user that the page that you're looking for doesn't exist.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.930
So I'm gonna add a hit three our class off next batch danger that gives you a red color and

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.820
then I can say sorry,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.150
the page you're looking for,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.750
it doesn't exist.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.790
Likewise,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.650
I'm gonna clear another file called error jsp here,

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.410
going to copy and paste the same thing back over here.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.230
Except that the error message can be something different.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.750
Let's say we give here Oops,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.250
there waas and at a why processing your request.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.180
At least retry off for a while.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.570
Andi,

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.620
If the purses please write toe letter,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.350
for example,

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.490
help desk at came.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.530
You know dot com on toe.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.070
Provide a hyperlink to the same.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.970
I can type your hft courts toe male do colon The humility on then the humility.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:25.370
It's them,

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.400
so it's a hyperlink.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.300
Now let's give a ending back for pattern of if you also want to,

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.220
can include the technical leaders off the error.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.920
But we will see that in a few minutes later.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:43.250
Let's say all the files and goto Don Cat restart the scene.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.050
Once it's research,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.880
let's go back toe the browser.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.770
Andi Again,

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.240
Let's go to the homepage and from here,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.410
let's click on all products and that's going toe Result into an exception.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.510
So we should see now are convenient error message that comes as hoops.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.960
There was another well processing your request.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.040
Oh,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.350
please,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.950
we try after a while and so on and so forth.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:07.950
Similarly,

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.220
if I go here and then type just like the previous one,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.650
some junk character now and enter you will again see that Sorry.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.770
The page you're looking for doesn't exist.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.230
So most commonly these the two erroneous situation that you would like to handle.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:27.960
And since we are redirecting toe er just before any kind of sorrow said error all over her

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.150
handling is taken care off.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.480
However,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.250
there is no spring in work in this scenario,

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.230
which is what we want to do.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.250
So we have more control within our that controllers.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:45.220
So let's go back toe the reptile x eman and come into this one because this is what we are

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.550
more interested to handle.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.120
Save the file and close that.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:57.110
And let's also goto our father controller by going toe navigate open the source our command

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:04.950
shift our our control shift on windows and then they hear Pradit controller and here itself

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.440
we can provide a a new function toe handle all exceptions.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.010
So let's go here and create a function.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.080
The function is just like any other request handling function.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.680
It's returned IBIs going to be a string.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.950
Our model and view string means it's the view name.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.150
Modern view is an object that weapon sport model as a list of unit.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.900
So we're gonna follow the same pattern that we have been following.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.550
So I'm gonna give your public string on the written valley would be,

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:34.260
er,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:41.460
which is nothing but editor Chase be So let's give your name called error handler and then

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.030
we can ask for what was the exception that took place.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:51.820
So with the exception e x and we can also say her model modern in case if you want to store

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.850
this exception object or its other details in the modern itself,

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.320
that's going right.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.220
The body for this American value,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.820
like I said,

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.640
is gonna be er onda because of for viewers over,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.860
this is gonna be perfect sense affixed with slash,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.910
weapon of slash,

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:14.960
pages slash and then a dot jsp has the suffix now toe add the log messages.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.190
So first we have toe create a variable called lager Initialize that and then use that

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.540
because we're using Lamberg Lumber also has a support for a cell,

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.970
a fortune and the annotation is very simple.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.200
At the red slf Orci,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.990
you press control space and you can see regarded.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.560
This creates a member very well here called Long.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.200
If you go to the outline here you can see that there is a private starting final variable

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.880
called Law after a lager,

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.160
and that's been initialized.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:45.660
Answer.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:52.510
All I have to do is to go and start using them by typing log dot functions like debug in

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.970
four other editor.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.620
I'm going to say here because it is an error.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.160
So we're gonna say longer,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.450
better and then I'll say he extort get localized message.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.470
And that's the only thing that we want to do.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.400
If you're using something like Ivana,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.820
you will be ableto collect all the log,

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.710
led us into a dashboard and then analyze that.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.950
Let's go and say model dot attribute,

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.650
Give it a name.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.440
Let's call it us.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.880
X itself Attribute is also the GX itself.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.570
So the one that we received here,

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.220
we're gonna pass it on to the modern.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:32.810
So we know that this is gonna be in the request of scope so we can go toe jsp and then say

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.850
request Don't get attribute off E X.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:36.510
Now,

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.660
since we have to tell spring that this is an error handler,

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:45.380
we're gonna say you're admitted exception handler and then say what kind off exceptions

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.800
dysfunction should handle.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.340
And if you're interested in handling all kinds of exceptions,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.170
use the more general exception.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.150
Dark Class.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:59.200
And now Spring knows that whenever there is an exception within this particular product

00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.980
controller,

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.570
this is the exception handler for that particular exception that got thrown.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.920
Let's save this restart,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.550
dunk it,

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.940
go back to the Rosa.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:16.210
Let's click on all products again and see that we do get this time hoops.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:20.520
There was an editor while processing your request and the same error page,

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.050
even though we have committed the actual core in Vega XML fight.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.680
Also notice that if I go back to the console here,

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:36.100
we should see an error that actually got printed because off our lock 40 lakhs.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.850
One more thing that we also are interested to do is tow.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.220
Use this e X in our yard,

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:42.830
our jsp.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.950
So let's open the era that GSP here.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:53.450
I can probably provide a pre formatted text and then use a script lit and then say here

00:11:53.450 --> 00:12:05.800
exception g X equals toe request dot Get attribute off the X requested get attribute

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:12.110
returns a child of language object reference and hence we need to do a casting here and now

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:16.050
I can use this e x and then say bring stack trees.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:20.430
But the Prince Tak dress will be printing on the server side console.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:26.100
You know to say that I want the status to be printed right here where the supply the

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:31.870
variable out here but out of the GSP Reiter Whereas the cream stacked restrict was a print

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.300
traitor.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.100
So we can see your new job.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.150
Alert your heart Print Traitor.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:43.860
Off boat out is the implicit GST object that turbulence what is being written over here.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.790
So if I save this on,

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:47.350
go back over here,

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.880
refresh the page or make another request over here.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.750
We should know.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.010
See a detail exceptions actress Also.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:55.960
However,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.570
for a regular user,

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.290
this might be kind of scary.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.140
We don't want toe do that.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.150
Probably we can give here a button that is click your view.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:09.250
The detailed exception structures are detailed technical errors.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:16.890
So let's go back on a javascript court here that can show the initially hidden pre formula

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:17.490
text.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:18.950
So the initially hide this.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:24.370
Let's give a style here and then say visibility off hidden.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:30.310
We want to give it an ID saying that this is the other details so that we want toe,

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:36.490
find this other details and then show that because it's initially hidden and to trick out

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:36.950
this,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:41.850
displaying off this particular pre formatted text that's at a button.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:47.110
And let's add a class Off PD and Bt and iPhone League.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.560
So even though there's a button,

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.030
it looks like a link.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:55.650
And then we say on click equals two that the show at our details,

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.200
which is a childhood function which we're going to write.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.290
And then I'm gonna take your short technical details slash button.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.340
Let's clear dysfunction as a job loss could function.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.920
This has nothing to do with spring all jsp.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.640
So it's just a helper function that we're gonna right on.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:19.500
It's typically a one liner that's call another function Shorty dates we have toe get this

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.740
particular element.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.280
Whose idea is this?

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.620
So I'm gonna say document.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:32.800
Don't get element by idee off this I d dot stayed server getting a reference to this

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.400
attribute and then say the visibility should be changed to to risk people.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.650
Let's go back to our browser,

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.470
go back to home,

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.500
click on all products on.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.920
We should now see that there is a short technical details clicking on which we get the rest

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.830
of the details.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.400
Let's come back to our eclipse.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:58.850
This controller function that we have return handles exceptions only in product controller

00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:58.850
.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.140
Internally,

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.370
we have only one controller that matters,

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.580
which is a product controller.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.840
But in a large scale application,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.290
you're gonna have supplier controllers,

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.350
category controller,

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.440
customer controller,

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:10.930
employees,

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.750
controller and so many other controllers.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.160
Obviously,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.500
there is no point in repeating the same thing.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.670
For every other controller,

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.170
a better way would be toe externalize.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:28.610
This from the controller on the way you do is you create a new class here and then tell

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.440
spring that hate anywhere there is an exception.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.410
This class should be instance created and the function should be executed.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:41.170
So we'll call this US global exception and look,

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:45.200
And then this is a regular job Close.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.860
We can cut this particular function from here and then based inside this and this is not a

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:51.710
controller,

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.130
but it's an adviser to the controller.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.530
So we call this as controller adviser,

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.230
We'll also need to have this log.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:07.960
So we're going to say that there it s L F 40 And now Spring knows that whenever there is an

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.630
editor,

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.010
this object will be incensed.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:17.800
Rated on dysfunction would be executed as long as it's an instance off exception or it's up

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.450
glasses.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.460
So in the other class,

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.870
we don't need any of those unused imports.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.000
Let's remove that.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.960
Save it.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.550
Come back over here.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.890
Onda se that fine now off course.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.530
If I run this code,

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.090
I should still see the same.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.560
Let's go back to over Don Cat,

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:41.950
restart once more and go back to the browser.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.140
Click somewhere else and come back toe all products.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.150
Once again,

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.520
we should see a similar error message,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.560
but this time coming from a global exception handler.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.530
So if you add more and more controllers,

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.150
we don't have to worry about exception handling separately.
