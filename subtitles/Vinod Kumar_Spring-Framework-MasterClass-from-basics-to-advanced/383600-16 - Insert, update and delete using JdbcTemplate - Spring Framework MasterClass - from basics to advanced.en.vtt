00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
Now that we have the GBC template that's going and test or the same thing using a program,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.450
let's go create a new program.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.350
This time I'm gonna create a new class under programs package that's called US P zero to

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.460
testing jelly.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.780
Busy template.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.280
Press enter.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.670
I forgot to add the main function,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.200
but I can always type main control spaced.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.750
Enter toe at the Me now,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.100
since we want to test oh,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.460
many features off this jelly busy template.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.550
Let's write smaller functions to do the same thing and all the functions we want to make

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.940
its of the Jedi busy template.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:44.230
So let's create a static reliable off the GBC template called template and initial Is that

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.230
over here?

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.800
So we can use the same template in other functions.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.750
I'm really use the annotation conflict application context.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.890
CTX City.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.820
It's because toe new allegation,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.810
conflict application,

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.260
context and supply this 84 which is up conflict folder class.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.470
Now we have a spring contain already somewhere down the line,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.210
we want to close that other ways.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.750
We will have a cause of a resource leak,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.110
and now that we have the spring container,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.980
we can ask for an object off this jelly busy template.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.900
So I'm going to say your template equals Toe City.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.480
It start,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.770
get Bean on.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.240
This time,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.790
I'm only going to simply supply their data like and not the name.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.640
So we now have no ambiguity because there's only one single instance off,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.390
very busy template in the in depth sprinkled dinner,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.390
which is this and that is actually going to be true and given to me over here.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.260
Suppose we want to add a new record toe our database table.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.610
Let's go over its to console on.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.070
Have a look at this table called shippers.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.780
There are only three columns there,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.150
so it's easy for me to add a new record.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.290
Let's assume that we want to insert a new record with ideas for some company names.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.940
Some dummy phone number in typical Jerry BC It would have taken at least around 10 lines of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.410
court,

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.530
but as now I can do that with the help off this template in a single line.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.970
For example,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.510
I'm call a non existing function card insert ship,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.170
and this gives me an editor.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.830
Whenever you get an error,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.820
you can move the cursor on that to see what's the other and quick fix.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.810
But since I knew that this is a non existing function,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.490
I know that eclipses also telling me the same thing.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.530
I can simply press command one or controlled one and get the quick fix press enter will see

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.270
that it creates me a new function.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.780
See,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.010
here there's some boxes you can more on those boxes by present tab.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.780
And if there are some options available,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.320
Eclipse will suggest and we want a package level here.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.190
The function is wide.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.290
It's no problem in 30 people we want to really know,

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.850
and then I can delete this.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.450
Do you know?

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.420
And then I'd make for over here.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.530
So basically,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.610
we are not going to call this function on Transfer the control over here where I have

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.010
access to this template.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.180
And using this template,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.750
I want to insert a new record,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.950
and it's as simple as calling template or update equal int off executive update in a

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.250
prepared statement.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.080
So I said,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.450
template updated.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.450
The actually still command is insert into shippers values on did supply question Mark.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.360
Come on,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.460
Kashima Kamen Caution.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.740
Mark these the three parameters and I cannot supply the perimeters like this say idea is

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.230
for Let's assume that I have Sears and being called caving or transports on.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.820
Let's a phone number something like this and close the bracket.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.100
So as you can see,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.340
I have a single function call over here,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.720
and I supplied an SQL Command,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.600
which has three parameters,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.890
and I'm supplying the values for those three parameters.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:04.670
And,

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.070
of course,

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.850
I can always give a message saying that data inserted at the new shipper data inserted.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.670
Let's give it a try by running the court.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.840
Let's say all of them and then click the run button average.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.660
Simply say,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.390
new shipper data inserted.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.290
If I go back over here and then click the run button,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.550
you'll see that the new record has been addict successfully as well.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.270
You can use the same template for update for updating records,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.830
for example,

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.660
that I want to change the phone number off a shipper,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.250
for example.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.600
That's it.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.060
This is the shipper idea,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.090
and I want to supply a new phone number.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.850
Let's write a function.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.310
I'm gonna come in this one so that I don't want to really call that.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.440
Let's call it us off David Schaper four.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.950
And I want to stop by a ship our I D,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.850
which is four on a new phone number.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.550
Let's give the same thing in a different format.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:05.350
Let's give something like this one for toe four dash 784 Something like that.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.540
And this function also doesn't exist.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.320
Eclipse is giving me an editor again.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.030
A press command one Enter Tab.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.550
I still like the package.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.040
I don't need to change the return type.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.310
No need to change the function name that day.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.540
Today India is fine,

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.840
but this is instead off.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.370
I I can take here as shipper.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.630
I'd,

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.830
er just i d And then string is fine,

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.350
But this is supposed to be for Let's get it off the studio.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.150
And now we simply call the template dot did function.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.550
We supply the sq and then Islay and form.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.070
We don't have the SQL.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.570
Let's create a new reliable called s Cured,

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:50.270
which is updated Shippers against a set phone equals toe question mark where?

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.710
Shipper underscore idea equal.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:53.470
Stupid question,

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.750
Mark.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.890
Now I have a small issue here because the first question mark corresponds to phone.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.790
I have toe change this summer.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.290
Cut this from here and paste over here.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.920
So template or update takes an SQL command on the values.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.960
For all the question marks that skill command has on,

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.360
Let's give him a stage over here saying that corn off addicted.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.340
Save this around the core and you'll see that it simply says,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.910
phone updated.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.190
If I go here on run the same once again,

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.090
you'll see that we got the result.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.800
Similarly,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.230
Andi,

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.620
I should have given three digit high fund four digit.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.440
No problem.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.550
I can just go here on change this like this.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.460
Run the cord and the phone got updated.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.100
So let's go refresh.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.170
You see that we got our new phone number template.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.500
That object can also be used for deleting a record as well.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.200
But generally we don't do a hard delete.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.180
We do something called Self did it where the actual record exists.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.510
But there'll be a flag,

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.050
which indicates that the record is inactive
