00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.130
in this video that is discuss about the model view controller architecture when it claimed

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.100
sends a request.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.570
Let's see how Model view controller works together.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.910
Toe produce an output.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.290
So we have here a client and we have here that container which is stunk it in our case

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:24.020
model is a bunch off Java objects which could be re used in other applications.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.610
Also,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.300
even if it's not a Web application,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:35.180
So these include entities are said races Andi was they don't have any dependency on several

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.730
a p a.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.320
There,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.140
just like helper classes,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.440
they can be tested independently as well.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.000
So let's write this ask Modern view,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.840
on the other hand,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.650
is a template ing technology which has the ability toe combine java objects with its female

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.710
content and produce a HTML visit.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.340
So the most popular one and the one that we're gonna use is jsp.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.810
But there are others suggest,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.640
for example,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.650
velocity three months of our time leaf and many others as well.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.800
So let's name this s view on the central toe.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.210
NBC is the controller which is a coordinator between all these things.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.150
Since the controller is supposed to coordinate between client model and view.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:29.360
The best suited technology here is sublet because the seller has access toe the select

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.980
container.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.610
It has access to resources such as model and view and also has access to the claim request

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.610
.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.720
So several has typically four responsibilities.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.420
Number one.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.140
When a client makes a request,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.570
read all imports such as request parameters.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.510
Heather's cookies request body etcetera.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.400
Number two is toe.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.630
Identify an appropriate model method and in walk the same to get the model data number

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.020
three.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.560
Store that model later in some common storage location.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.430
We call it that the scope there's a request called the recession scope,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.730
and there's an application school.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.820
So some really supposed to store that modern leader in one of those scopes and number four

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.900
responsibility off the controller is toe forward to on a problem view or JSP page.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.650
In our case,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.790
JC has access to the modern little story in the school,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.290
uses the template HTML and combines the model data to gender.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.750
The next email on that generated X human is given back to the controller and controller

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.870
takes that and simply gives it back to the client.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.010
So this way,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.660
all components off NBC Architectures said his model view on controller have their own

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.050
responsibilities on,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.680
not or stepping on others responsibilities.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.150
In NBC,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.090
A model and view can be reused in other requests also.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.670
So this is the working off an NBC application.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.090
In the next video,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.910
let us understand how this works,

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.290
using an example.
