00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
Let's know,

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.090
provided another link here,

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.860
which says,

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:09.240
Add a new product clicking on which I want to get in its team and form for adding a product

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.870
with all the default values off the product.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.310
Object,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.950
if any,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.270
and they connect.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.870
Click on the submit button.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.800
The data should be collected back by the server at the same to the database table and then

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.550
comes back with this particular screen again.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.950
This in walls.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.500
Three different controller handler functions.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.200
Number one is a controller that can give you a product details in the form of an HTML form

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.200
.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.440
Number two.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.200
When you submit the data,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.450
should be collected by his handler.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.760
Do some validations at the same thing to the reader Bish and comes back to the browser and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.640
tells the closer to redirect toe.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.170
This product didn't speech to understand the same.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.580
Let's go back toe the header D.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.900
J.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.950
Steve at a hyperlink first.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.240
So meanwhile,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.730
I'm gonna stop the server.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.290
Otherwise it keeps restarting.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.020
Let's go to the head of dodgy SPF at a pipe here.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.390
Maybe I would like to copy this one's.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.160
I had one pipe symbol faced over here.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.130
Now this is not gonna be a price form that's called us at product.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.550
Let's give a text,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.140
add product.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.450
Our new product.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.290
Save this.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.520
When I click on this hyperlink,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.530
this is always going toe.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.990
Send http.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.050
Get request.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.400
So let us right a controller function that corresponds to this particular urine part,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.390
but specifically the get matter.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.160
So let's go to the product controller and write a new function over here that is public

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.840
stream at product,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.590
which takes model as a perimeter and keeps a new product object in the modern.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.620
So with modern,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.310
not add attribute the activity name.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.570
Let's call it S p R,

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.050
and there's gonna be a new product.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.300
Let's also import this and now I have toe go on,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.890
render an extreme inform.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.540
All I have to do is to say,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.950
return product,

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.890
for we don't have this product form,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.190
so we have to create one.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.500
Let's do that in a minute.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.340
But before that,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.840
let's be specific about what kind of extra DP matter and what's the Ural?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.390
That we want toe map to this particular function,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.590
which is very simple.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.480
We say that the rate request mapping slash our product.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.750
That's the urine,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.160
but If you want to give the http matter also,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.770
then you have to say you're far equals toe our product and then you can see here.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:47.900
Method equals toe request matters dot Get let's go and clear this product form under pages

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.720
New JSP product that form I'm naming.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.800
This is a product form,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.970
not as ad product,

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.800
because I want to use the same product form for even editing.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.210
Also,

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.250
that's there is an Ambien neutral name here,

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.540
Let's click Finished.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.580
Let's get off.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:14.460
All these are a directive include fighting because toe dark GSP and a copy is the same.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.200
Make this as footer and here is where I want to have an extra animal farm now,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.870
while I can rate my own HTM inform here there is an easier way to associate the product

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.360
object that we have here SPR toe the form so that the data gets automatically copy to the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.910
form.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.730
Plus,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.770
when we submit,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.700
a new product,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.970
object can also be created easily.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.320
For this we have toe add the fag live directive because then comes with its own GST tax.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.780
So let's type your u R I equals two and wait for a second and the last couple of them.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.860
If you see there from Spring Famer Spring Framework dot odd slash tax and there is a tags

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.790
slash form,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.150
this is the one that we want.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.070
Let's elect that and then either.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.830
Perfect.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:09.190
If you see the perfect that it suggested this form what I lose value sf So that it doesn't

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.670
confuse us with form because there's an alternate team attack or form.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.430
So let's give it us sf for string forms.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.270
And now I can say you're sf Colon and if you press control space,

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.760
you get a lot of tags.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.540
So the one that I want to start with is SF Colon form and then slash sf colon form their

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.950
circle.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.290
Inform regionally add or associate this with something called model attribute and we

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.490
assigned PR here because PR is the model.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.260
Attribute that restore over here.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.530
So this is exactly for model activity here.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.250
Now the P R is associated with human form.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.840
What I want is a text box.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.320
Let's say for the time being,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.520
we're gonna just type your yes if colon input input corresponds to text box part here

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.880
corresponds to the getter and settle off this particular PR,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.650
which is nothing but the property off the PR object.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.500
So if PR is a product and I want to associate the product name with this,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.990
all I have to do is to say your product name.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.220
This is the member variable with Get her settled in PR now automatically.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.380
The product name would be associate ID over here just for a demonstration.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.870
Let's goto product controller and let's say we cleared here.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.150
PR equals two new product on the other is supposed to be created.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.710
Let's add your beer dot stepped brought up name.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.980
And for the sake of demo,

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.210
let's type your name or product so instructs are playing a new product or here,

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.870
let's supply p off.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.930
Save this.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.170
This is a temporary fix.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.640
I'm gonna remove this and come back toe the same.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.380
So let's go right Click the project on a run as run on Sarwar.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.850
That saved the fights.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.550
So here we are,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.240
getting the home pitch.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.250
If I go to the ad product,

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.560
we should get an HTML form with one textbooks,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.560
and the textbook shows the value off the product object.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.000
If you go back over here,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.280
you can see that in the product form.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.770
We are only saying SF colon input,

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.400
part physical product name.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.520
But if I have you paid source over here and then check the core The SF colon form has been

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.910
changed.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.210
Toe form an I d for the form itself is given a spear that was old model a tribute.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.010
There is an action that was added automatically and nor the action we did not give It took

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.640
the current action itself.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.670
This is the current action.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.910
So our product,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:51.750
the same urine pot is also taken as this but very importantly method has become posed Now

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.460
we didn't give this,

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.200
but that the poor.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.390
So that means if I separate this particular form,

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.200
we don't have a handler here,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.150
even though we have a handler for our product.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.650
But this is specifically forget request not for posed.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.500
We have to collect the product submitted in another handler function.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.700
So we'll do that in a bit later.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.040
Let's come back over here.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.200
You can also see I gave SF Colon in port part physical product name,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.200
but it's converted into a next year multi called input I physical product name,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.760
name,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.850
physical product names.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.330
So when you submit the form,

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.750
this is what goes to the handler function in the form off post perimeters,

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.510
and the type is equal to text by default.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.460
We also have the value.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.900
This one came from pr dot get product name.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.390
So let's go back on.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.890
Bond cleared a complete HTML form this time.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.760
I also want to have proper former using some styling before that.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.390
Let's also change this back toe new product over here,

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.440
and I don't need these two lines.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:59.850
Let's get it off that come back toe product form now we want toe do some styling also here

00:07:59.850 --> 00:07:59.850
.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.790
So the first thing that I want to do is to get off this.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:09.410
Let's do whose class equals toe form group on a roll.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:14.760
We want to have a label and a text box so the label is gonna be occupying.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.820
Let's say four builds out off 12 so that's a label.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:23.230
Class equals toe call Dash and Dash 44 equals toe.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.850
Let a product me because that's gonna be the idea of the textbooks.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.120
Let's give a caption here as product Me.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:37.520
We'll also give another deal with Safe Classic was toe call M V eight.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.860
That's the remaining eight out of 12.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.760
Insert this.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.690
I'm gonna have a import.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.530
But the input this time is gonna be a self colon.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.250
Input that the text box,

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.580
part physical stow product leave.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.780
This takes care of ivy and name attributes of HTML text books.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.780
Apart from that,

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.860
I can also say here,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.980
CSS class equal stoop,

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.220
This will be eventually converted into class over here.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.450
So that's the way it's gonna work on here as a form control.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.240
That's the CSS class.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.900
So we got for one.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.850
So this is the product name.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.960
I want a copy and paste this for the remaining eight or nine off them and make the

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.640
necessary changes for no.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.420
I'm gonna have text boxes for all of them.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.750
But eventually I want to have some radio buttons and drop downs.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:31.190
I know that in their form is really including the submit button over here.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:36.380
Let's go and right click on my project run as a run on server.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.870
So we got the homepage.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.790
Let's click on the Add a product and now we see we got a product name category.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.280
All of these are being text boxes.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.990
I also the submit changes.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.950
If I take some values and then click on the submit button,

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:58.800
I will get another because I don't have a handler for post Method for this particular you

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.040
are.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.480
So let's for strike this handle function.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.960
Go back to the court.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.650
Let's stop the Tomcat.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.500
Let's go to our product controller.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.850
I'm gonna write a function here called Public String.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:18.230
Let's give a generate name called same product instead of add product because I want to use

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.880
the same thing for edit product also,

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.890
So I'm gonna call it as safe product.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.660
We can ask spring to give me a entire product.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.040
Objects.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.850
That is the beauty off springs dependency injection.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.680
Let's call it US PR.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.370
But first,

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.520
let's add the same request mapping bird with the post method over here.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.880
But then,

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.130
if I want to re use this for update also,

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.940
I have to call this something else.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.280
That's call it US safe product instead of our product.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.120
However,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.570
in the HTML form,

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.690
if you go back over here and then say view paid source,

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.950
the action corresponds toe ad product,

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:01.210
and it is only going to look for a handler that takes post as the request made it and add

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.600
product as the U.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:02.950
N.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.490
In order for me to say that the form should have same product,

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.810
we can simply go back to the form and then in the beginning,

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.360
where we have a safe form tag over here,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:18.200
I can say your action equals two and then say same dash product,

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.060
even if I'm reusing the same HTML form in edit.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:22.750
Also,

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.320
when we submit the control goes always toe say product,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.520
not for edit or update product.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.840
So coming back toe controller,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.600
we now have a handle for days now.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:39.370
How this spring Know what to give here when you given entity object here as a perimeter.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:44.320
What's fingers this spring is going to create a new object off this class So PR is called

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.000
The new product is done by spring and then makes a list off all the properties off this

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.580
product.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:55.310
The property that this product is nothing but the member variables with its respective

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.550
getters and centers and tries to look for hits.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.500
TDP request perimeters with the same name like product,

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.970
80 product name and so on and so forth.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.720
And then If it is phone,

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:12.210
it's gonna assign using the center for this particular newly constructed product object.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.030
So spring basically converts the list off.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.640
Http.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.380
Request perimeters in tow,

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:22.640
a product object and then inject the same over here in case if some of the properties like

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.200
for example,

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:23.920
product ready,

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.280
is not there in the form it will be left as the default.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.010
So in our case,

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:28.900
the product I d.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.080
D for values none.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.210
And that will be no.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.110
So now that we have the product object given by the end user,

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.550
we can say here HD Delwar dot ad product and then supply this PR.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.840
This actually throws an exception.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.060
But for the time being,

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.700
let's throw it away from the function itself we're having.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.200
It tries to act this product.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.880
We can ask high benetto automatically gender the product i d.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.120
So let's go to the product of Java.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.000
This is the primary key mapping over here.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.830
Well,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:06.920
I can see that this is a generated revenue generator equals toe increment on hibernate,

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.580
automatically tries to find what is the maximum value off the product early in the table,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.450
and then increments that by one and that becomes the new product.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:21.830
I d Now that the new product ideas generated by hibernate this PR will have the product 80

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:21.830
.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.570
So that means before this particle line appeared or get productivity would give,

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:26.010
you know,

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.630
But after this line,

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.770
PR not get product ready will give you a new product ready.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.380
So now that I have this,

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:38.230
I cannot redirect this toe the product details handler.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.840
So this is going to be a client side redirection,

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.160
which means here,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.290
when I returned the view here like this,

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:53.770
we're going to say the direct colon with a product details Question Mark Ivey equals toe

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:54.780
Plus here,

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.140
Don't get product.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.850
I d well written this particular view.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.220
Redirect Colon here is like a protocol to spring.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:08.760
It says that we now have to generate a three not to its TDB response indicating that the

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.220
browsers should come back.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.480
Our revisit the server to this Yura,

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.510
this could be a euro two different domain also,

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.860
but we are actually giving a related part,

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.070
which means it's gonna come back to the same several application were part of details.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.460
Customer ID equals to the newly genital ready,

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.440
and that is going to be handed by this particular handler,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.320
where the request perimeter idee is now taken,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.990
which is nothing about this product I D.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.760
And it searches for the product in the native is,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.630
which is the newly added product object on,

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.260
then stores that in the attribute,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.750
and it's going to go to the actual product details speech.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.240
So let's give it a try.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.020
I'm gonna save all the fights.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:52.260
Go back toe the project right click run as run on server.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.180
Let's go to the ad product.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.600
Let's give a product name as,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.280
let's say,

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.730
mineral water category.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.510
I'll have to give an idea right now,

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.690
so I'm gonna give Category one supplier one.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.900
I really should be a drop down.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.790
I should be able to see the list off all available categories I should be able to select

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.410
from the list.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.570
Off available suppliers will do that subsequently.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.560
Unit Price.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.370
Let's assume that it's going to be around,

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.200
say,

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.000
$8 quantity.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.600
Poor unit.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:30.260
Let's assume that it's gonna be five bottles back units in stock.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:30.560
Let's say,

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.150
for example,

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:36.960
we have around 120 units units and orderly 20 to reorder level.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.900
Let's assume 10 discontinued.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:39.650
No.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.930
So I have to give zero or one at this point in time.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:43.670
Eventually,

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.760
this is going to be converted into a radio button.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.250
We'll do that in the next video.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.180
Let's click.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.740
The submit changes.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.340
Hopefully,

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.880
there is nothing wrong on.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.110
We should be able to see this data added to the database.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:16:00.770
And then the next two page that we should see is the redirected product it and speech

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.190
before submitting.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.470
Let's also do and inspect Element on.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.290
Instead of going to the Elements section will go to the network,

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:14.000
step over here so we can see when I submit what actually kind off requests that go to the

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.660
server.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.830
So let's make some room over here.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.940
Let's click on the submit changes,

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.650
and you can see that the first is going to the same product.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:29.000
Let's go see what the actual editor on it is that there is a spelling mistake for inclement

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.000
.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.270
So let's go back to this.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.430
Go back to our core instead.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.760
Off increments.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.850
I misspelled the increment here,

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.420
so now I think it's okay.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:45.670
Lets go restart our server so the surgery's restarted.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:52.110
Let's go back over here and then clear the requests that click submit changes,

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:56.250
and now you can see that we were able to go to the same product.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.790
But after the same product,

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.100
the response has been 302.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.660
If you look at the same product,

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.310
the response,

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.430
or hear the responses,

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:11.750
we should redirect this toe something called product details ideas equal to 78 I got the

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:17.350
idea equals 2 78 1 of the thing that I can see here that I gave the category and suppliers

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.920
one,

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.600
but that was not taken.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.240
I'll tell you why it did not take them in a minute.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.450
But let's go and very fighter in the DB also,

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.260
so we can go to the It's to console.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.760
Let's go refresh your Andi connected back.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.160
Go to the product stable.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.500
I can also say ordered by product underscore idee descending.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:46.530
You can see the latest record that is 78 mineral water null and null.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:46.930
Now,

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:51.530
the reason why this has bean now is if you go back to the product or Java here.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:57.200
We said that the column mapping for supply already and Category 80.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.690
We said the supply already is insult.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:01.980
Herbal equals toe false.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.370
That means the value for this cannot be used for inserting.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.750
So the value has come from the browser to this variable.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.560
But it was never taken to the database,

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.740
so ultimately,

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.480
we had to supply the value from here that we did not do.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.520
But if you want to do that,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:25.110
you could probably are in the product form instead off a category idea.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.380
Here,

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.000
I should say your category dark category 80 and supply or supply Ready.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.280
We'll do that when we provide that dropped down over here.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.050
But for now,

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.120
this is okay.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.570
So we are able toe add a new product a car using on HTML form.
