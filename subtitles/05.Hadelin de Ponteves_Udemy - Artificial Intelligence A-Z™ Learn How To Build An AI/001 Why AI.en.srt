00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,230
Hello and welcome to the course on artificial intelligence ages.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,840
My name is Colonel Reiko and on behalf of I love the West the construction of this course.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,070
I'd like to welcome you into this amazing adventure that we're about to start.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,060
And what's up with this timer.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,300
Well the reason for this cyber is this is my third time regarding this tutorial and I get so excited

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,510
about these things and it just goes over like blows over 10 minutes or 20 minutes so I decided to limit

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:32,870
myself to five minutes to get you excited about this course and why it's the best time to be in a job.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,020
So let's dive into a good four and a half minutes left.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,100
Why.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,650
Well we've all heard about applications of artificial intelligence that are popping up around us self-driving

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,500
cars medicine heavy machinery.

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,380
The of a service the list just keeps going on and on and on.

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,020
But why right now why not 10 years ago not ten years later.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,240
Well the answer is hidden in this current which is called Moore's Law.

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:03,800
It was originally identified in 1965 or more and what it says is that the power of the average computer

16
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,420
in like in very simple terms the power of the average computer which you can buy for a thousand dollars

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,140
will double every 18 to 24 months.

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,470
And that's been as easy as the law has held and through good times and bad.

19
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,520
War and Peace and the recession depressions and nothing stops this.

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,720
And we've already surpassed the brain of an insect for another computer was going by for a thousand

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,350
bucks.

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:34,220
We're sitting at about the speed of the processing power of the brain of Arat by 2025 will be at the

23
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:34,750
brain of a human.

24
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,760
As you can see it's exponentially growing.

25
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,740
And so this is a great time to be in artificial televisions.

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,290
It's just going to be doubling the power is going to be doubling every time or every three minutes.

27
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:53,190
So what's some my favorite examples are related to games like chess and go.

28
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:58,770
So in 1997 deep mind was the first computer to beat Gary Kasparov in chess.

29
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:04,830
It was a huge thing was like one of the most broadcasted chess games on the planet ever.

30
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,430
And at the same time.

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:13,130
So that was like consider it an impossible feat right now on any phone you can install at chess which

32
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,920
no human player will ever be.

33
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,350
Because computers are that good.

34
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:23,070
Now you just cannot beat a computer in Chesapeake put on the hardest setting and then just recently

35
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,850
in Marsch doesn't succeed.

36
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:31,570
A computer won against the 18 World times champion and world champion of the game of Go.

37
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,830
Lisa idole again considered an impossible feat even at the start of the match.

38
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,520
It was considered to have to be impossible that it's only going to happen 10 years from then but it

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,130
happened.

40
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,880
And by the way if you'd like find out a bit more about the game.

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,280
It's very very exciting very interesting.

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,920
It's got 40 media players.

43
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,950
The thousand year old game very popular in China Japan and Korea.

44
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,240
And it's much more complex than chess so it's just that there's many more possible combinations.

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,520
So again something I would consider impossible is happening and it's happening now and much earlier

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,430
than it's time.

47
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,780
So how are we going for time.

48
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,660
One minute 50 seconds.

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,510
So that's what you'll see from this course you'll see that we're using games to train AI Why are we

50
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,020
doing that.

51
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:23,350
Because games are a confined environment where we can if we can beat a game using an artificial intelligence

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,620
then we can use the same principles to apply to business.

53
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,550
And that's the exact same thing that the team at Google deep mine who created Alpha go who want to get

54
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,250
these adult.

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,740
That's exactly what they did.

56
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,710
They applied artificial intelligence to Google's warehouse to control the air cooling.

57
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,300
And what they found is that the electricity bill is a consumption you can see like it's going like this.

58
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,900
Soon as they switch on the AI goes down.

59
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,880
And then they switch it back off goes up.

60
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,950
They were able to save 40 percent on their electricity bill and I have one that 40 percent so you can

61
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,470
find the full article on the deep mine blog.

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,040
That is insane.

63
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,410
Imagine that for a company of Google's scale which has millions and millions of servers.

64
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,020
So there you go.

65
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,550
That's that's your connection between applying artificial intelligence and games and applying it to

66
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,000
business very very closely related.

67
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,020
And that's what you will be able to do after this course.

68
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,420
And finally one of my favorite blogs.

69
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,490
Wait but why dot com.

70
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,160
Check it out.

71
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,480
Amazing blog by Tim Urban.

72
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,060
This is how he describes the situation we're in.

73
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,790
This is us and technological progress.

74
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,500
We're sitting here.

75
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,140
This is what it looks like looks very very linear but because it's an exponential boom.

76
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,490
This is what's going to happen in the next two years and there's very strong evidence from the things

77
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,050
we seeing to suggest that we're sitting right over here and they can occur.

78
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,020
And that my friends in-shore is why it's so exciting to be alive right now.

79
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:56,220
Why is so exciting to be and get into and be in the space of artificial intelligence because the power

80
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:02,890
you have the locations that you will be able to create or the ways you will be able to have what is

81
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,980
going to be intense and insane.

82
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,080
And I can't wait to see on the first of all the scores.

83
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,540
Let's get this started.
