00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,950
Hello and welcome back to the course on artificial intelligence.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,560
In today's tutorial we're going to discuss the plan of attack for this amazing section on the most powerful

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,320
Ogger algorithm in artificial intelligence which is A-3 see at the moment.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,910
So let's have a look.

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,380
Today we'll talk about the following things.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,410
We'll start with the three A's of A3 C.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,740
So we'll talk about what the abbreviation stands for and how are we going to deal with the three A's

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,890
and also we'll look at the actual article or the actual research paper that gave birth to A-3 see the

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,950
deep Google deep mind research paper and we'll have a quick look at it so that you are more comfortable

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,780
navigating in your free time.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,740
Plus we will see exactly why the aid through see is the cutting edge most advanced algorithm on the

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,300
planet for individual intelligence.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,840
At the moment and why it's so important to have this in your arsenal.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,820
Next we're going to talk about the first day of A-3 which is actually critical.

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:08,430
Well it actually stands for a synchronous advantage active critic algorithm and so we're going through

16
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,530
the A's not in order but we're going through them in an order that makes sense for us that will help

17
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,960
us in our intuitive understanding.

18
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:22,380
Then we'll talk about the synchronous element in the A-380 algorithm and then we'll talk about that

19
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,890
Wantage and that's the tutorial where we'll put everything together and all start making sense.

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,980
So a quick word of caution that as you're going through these you might notice that after the active

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,360
critic and even after the synchronous or Tauriel you will still not exactly have the full picture of

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,790
full understanding of how this all ties in together.

23
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,030
And that's totally OK because they all these three elements they work in they indeed work together and

24
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,100
they require each other to function.

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,030
So just power through it and get to the third tutorial.

26
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,960
And in the Third World the advantage tural that's when it will all come together.

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,320
And if at that point you still don't quite understand something then you can just revise that specific

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,300
tutorial with this critical synchronous or that vonder tutorial to put all together.

29
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,970
But basically just don't get thrown off if after one of those tutorials you still feel that you need

30
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:21,390
someone information that's because they all work together to come to a to one function a 3D hologram

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,560
that's an advantage Tauriel that all ties in together very nicely.

32
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:33,480
And then finally we'll talk about some additions that you can add or some additional modules and elements

33
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,980
that you can add today through the algorithm.

34
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,170
The thing is that there's different versions of their algorithms different modifications and already

35
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,780
through the first four literals in the section Mool will we will see somewhat invocations and at the

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,340
end we will add in an extra one the long short term memory.

37
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,250
SDM.

38
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,050
Now here we won't go into a lot of detail.

39
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:00,620
Ellis Tam's that's a topic for another course but nevertheless you will get a overview of what LACMA

40
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,730
is and how those structures are or how those layers in your own networks work so that you have a better

41
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,360
understanding integration of the practical tutorials but very important also.

42
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,040
This will showcase how the A-380 algorithm can be modified to suit certain purposes.

43
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,250
So there we go that's the plan for this section.

44
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:27,000
Definitely it's going to be an exciting algorithm to look at because it's the top algorithm at the moment

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,320
in the world and we're going to be developing an intuitive understanding and then together with Adlon

46
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,630
after this you're going to be coding it which is very very exciting and I can't wait to see on the first

47
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,210
tutorial.

48
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,000
And until then enjoy AI.
