00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.460
Hi Guys welcome to the final tutorial for Breakout.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.600
Hey you guys are excited to have you here and we're happy to be all together again.

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.990
I have to do yes.

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.730
This time we're going to watch the result for Breakout which I remind was much more challenging than

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.290
do.

6
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.920
So let's hope we get some good results.

7
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.400
OK.

8
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.650
So here is the main code.

9
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.100
You know we have several calls to all the girls are here and here is the make up and the code that will

10
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.730
execute all the other code.

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.760
So building a whole network can train the agents and the create.

12
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.360
OK.

13
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.340
So basically what we're going to do is just execute just to see how it's going but we will not wait

14
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.380
for the result because actually takes several hours.

15
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.430
So we prepared the results in this Test folder.

16
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.830
We already have the video and we will show you right to that.

17
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.410
OK.

18
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.140
OK.

19
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.180
So to execute is basically just to select the whole code here.

20
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.600
And here we go.

21
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.520
Right.

22
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.700
And as you can see the videos are populated.

23
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.180
OK.

24
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.680
All right.

25
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.760
So right now we already have two videos.

26
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.620
And then the agents are training but it's going to take a long time.

27
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.690
Now what we're going to do is watch the results.

28
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.140
OK.

29
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.570
OK.

30
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.660
Which I haven't seen yet.

31
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.870
We haven't seen that yet.

32
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.790
All right.

33
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.740
So in the template folder that you will find on the website you will find two of Fullers Cotonou commands

34
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.550
and could with compass that see if you've missed any detail you can still have a look at this code.

35
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.870
Yeah.

36
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.270
All the comments will explain so each line is welcome and you can understand.

37
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.170
And then in this fall they will find this test folder.

38
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.620
And that's the folder that will be populated with the videos.

39
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.070
OK.

40
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.690
So that's where the videos are.

41
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.430
So this these are the videos of our previous training.

42
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.580
You know we trained them for a couple of hours and we are seeing these videos.

43
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.270
So we're going to watch them one by one starting with the first one and we're going to see if you know

44
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.740
we see some martial art spring break out.

45
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.570
And if we manage to solve it.

46
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.430
OK.

47
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.190
So let's have a look at the first video.

48
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.680
So this video is you know actually what we're going to do.

49
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.310
We're going to do some stop the training because it's slowing down my computer right now.

50
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.590
So I get interrupted.

51
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.270
But I'll get there.

52
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.670
So let's watch it for you.

53
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.730
It's going to be really bad because it's really the first one the battle might not even.

54
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.200
There we go.

55
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.860
It doesn't fly at all because you know it's the very beginning it doesn't know what to do.

56
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.910
And it's still a pre-processing the images of yet nothing.

57
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.450
And it might even be the case for the second video the second one the panel might not still not move.

58
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.400
OK.

59
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.840
So how what do you think of this.

60
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.260
That worth spending so much energy on it.

61
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.330
OK.

62
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.150
So next video we might have something maybe a little something a little bit of art of doing away towards

63
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.600
not even not even useless if we didn't break breakouts or no.

64
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.650
Now I call it does this have something cool.

65
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.660
Let's let's hope that we get something for the next one.

66
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.720
Yeah I think we get something because now I didn't say up better.

67
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.140
OK.

68
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.820
So now the eye has eyes it's can't see can't sense what it's doing.

69
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.690
But it's not very quick yet.

70
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.820
It's not a smart catch but it's a four four.

71
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.360
OK so next thing you know it looks much better now.

72
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.930
Yeah.

73
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.640
More time there.

74
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.780
You ready.

75
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.880
Let's have a look.

76
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.900
OK.

77
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.020
Got it.

78
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.910
Got you got another one last.

79
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.400
Yeah.

80
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.500
Still not perfect but definitely it's like a human plane.

81
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.030
Very good job but still it's like you know like a human plane like a five year old two year old human

82
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.450
guy.

83
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.450
Wow.

84
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.310
You get it now.

85
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.270
Yeah.

86
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.960
So you're old now.

87
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:21.140
Yeah but it's like it's doing you know trying to catch the boat with some weird tactic.

88
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.270
Yeah.

89
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.010
It's not like a perfect prediction of where the ball is going to be.

90
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.740
OK.

91
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.380
Up and get much better 27.

92
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.200
OK.

93
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.260
Next one 370.

94
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.720
OK.

95
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.450
OK.

96
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.190
That was 20 seconds.

97
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.060
OK.

98
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.740
Now I mean at the time.

99
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.460
Oh now I would say it's a five year old

100
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.570
OK for you.

101
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.500
Yeah.

102
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.880
And now the goal of the book is growing faster.

103
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.880
So it's of course much more difficult with students in great.

104
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.240
So let's see if we can be 27 time 23 24 28.

105
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.530
OK.

106
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.290
Here we go.

107
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.000
See it's getting better and that's a good sign.

108
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.960
OK call lasted three lives.

109
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.720
Next one was one minute 10 second guy.

110
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.510
That's the

111
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.780
straight there.

112
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.460
That's great.

113
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.590
And that's definitely a pronoun isn't it.

114
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.760
Yeah and you can tell if you're playing because it's like it's moving sporadically like super fast.

115
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.680
Yes.

116
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.910
And it's doing a lot of saving unnecessary moves but it's getting there.

117
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.410
Let's see how it does when the ball is moving really fast.

118
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.080
How one is supposed to be independent.

119
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.840
I don't know.

120
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.620
I think it's a bit on the color of the block in distress maybe.

121
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.530
Or is it just like random.

122
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.110
It looks like random but we should check out the rules.

123
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.160
But it's really doing great now.

124
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.720
Yeah.

125
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.060
So three four three four score plus really really great.

126
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.910
So yeah we definitely have some A-3 see thing and break on their.

127
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.910
Of analysis.

128
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:26.380
Yes it seems like we have a brain with memory not only with eyes as has good guys you know it's a pretty

129
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.570
quick gesture but also it's got some memory

130
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.950
I don't know when you use your memory to play out yourself of course.

131
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.570
Yeah.

132
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.750
OK.

133
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.910
So well done rather than to the A3.

134
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.440
I was the last one the last one.

135
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.760
Fifty five seconds or a little less.

136
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.490
You remember what the score was.

137
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.550
Now the previous one should get out to see if it get an improvement.

138
00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:02.090
One that gets an improvement every day takes place in the same incident that yeah that's your inspiration

139
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.540
the say

140
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.470
OK we go

141
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.220
you know.

142
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.830
Wish I like some music playing.

143
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.050
Well once they hit that

144
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.750
you can do it.

145
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.810
It's like on steroids.

146
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.960
Clicking left or right all the time.

147
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.650
But he's doing good.

148
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:52.000
Yeah but we might not solve the whole game of breaking up.

149
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.900
We just need to have it trained more.

150
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.380
Yeah.

151
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.570
Those are really good three really good

152
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.350
balls.

153
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:09.300
There was a little bit to 60 beat the score and there was don't see that as well.

154
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.700
So we did it didn't stop me I think very nice very nice.

155
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:15.610
Awesome.

156
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.830
So I hope you like this mostly.

157
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.830
I hope you like this powerful implementation of the A-3 see.

158
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.610
And yeah you can see what how hard it can do really well.

159
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.850
Yeah that's right.

160
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:35.820
Like at the end of the paper they have like a comparison of different algorithms.

161
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.550
And this one is the best one by far.

162
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:43.360
Not only they have the best comparison of these but also I experienced several of them.

163
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.830
And so I experienced the one without end and I see one with and definitely de-listing improved the algorithm

164
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.710
how much better is a much better life.

165
00:08:54.290 --> 00:09:02.180
I barely had some artificial intelligence before in the last like 15 seconds or 20 seconds but definitely

166
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.540
not more than 10 minutes.

167
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:04.630
As we saw here.

168
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.240
Yeah that's good.

169
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.860
Ok cool.

170
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.250
Thanks guys.

171
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.010
Thanks a lot.

172
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.130
That was the end of the third module and therefore the end of the Course.

173
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:20.530
Congratulations for having the three modules and mostly the A3 C which was a pretty big rig there.

174
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.960
And for sure explore the different modification that modifications exist today.

175
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:31.610
And you know maybe at the time we were watching this there's some really cool new advancements in ATC

176
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:37.150
and you can probably or even a new model even better than we see them.

177
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.130
