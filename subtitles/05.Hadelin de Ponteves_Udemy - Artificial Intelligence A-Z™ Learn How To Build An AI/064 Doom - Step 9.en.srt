00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,490
Hello and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,790
So now that we have a brain and a body we can make the AI of course we're going to assemble them and

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,240
you're going to see how now things are all going to make sense.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,190
You're going to understand why we had to make some classes or more specifically the purpose of making

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,020
these classes.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,540
And mostly you're going to get into it a sense of how you can play with objects to create new objects

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,150
bigger objects and as you understood we already created two classes the brain and the body.

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,730
So then by creating some objects of these two classes Well we can make a bigger object which will be

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,470
the AI.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,150
And that's exactly what we're going to do.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:44,250
Now we are going to make the AI by assembling the two classes that we created that is the brain and

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,850
the body.

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,160
So let's do this.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,700
It's going to become super intuitive.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:55,440
Now I'm going to introduce a new class which of course I'm going to call I because now we're ready to

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,160
make the final ai ai.

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:07,630
And right here I'm going to start with the IT function and what is this function going to take it is

18
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,260
right now that things will make a lot of sense.

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,370
Well first we get the inevitable self with the object.

20
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:20,980
But then the two arguments are going to be nothing else than a brain and the body.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,150
That's the two elements that we need to build an AI AI.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,180
We need a brain.

23
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,520
The neural network and a body which will play the action with some snacks.

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,560
And so now very simply what we have to do is defining the variables our object.

25
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,650
Because right now brain and body are just arguments so let's do this.

26
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:46,270
We have to make two variables obviously the first one is self brain which will be called to the brain

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:54,340
argument but which later will be a brain object created from the in class and then the second variable

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,630
itself that body which will be called to the body argument right here.

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,830
But which in the future will be of course and object of this next class.

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,040
And so now as simple as that.

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,470
Thanks to this pretty awesome structure that we made here we build an AI that trains yet not intelligent

32
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,240
yet but still we have a brain and a body.

33
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,720
So that's perfect.

34
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:25,480
And now the only thing that we have to do left is make a big forward function that will do the whole

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,510
propagation No since now our AI is assembled Well we're not going to use separately the two forward

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,380
functions.

37
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,300
You know the one of the brain and the one of the body we are going to make a big forward function which

38
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:44,830
will be our next function which will take the images as input then we'll probably get the signals in

39
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,380
the brain.

40
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,920
And for this we will of course use the first forward function and then once we get the output signals

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,320
of the brain we will forward these output signals into the body with the forward function here that

42
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,070
will use a certain next technique.

43
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,350
And then eventually we will return the actions to play.

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,940
And there is just now that we can make this big food function because we have assembled the brain in

45
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,630
the body.

46
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,690
And so we're not going to call this next function for it.

47
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,760
We're going to use the call function which is kind of like the init function with that we'll call the

48
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,250
two forward functions here from the brain in the body to propagate the signal from the very beginning

49
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,030
with the input images to the very end with the actions of play.

50
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:32,800
And that's why the next function will make now is this call function that will combine the two for functions

51
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,650
of the brain and the body.

52
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,490
That's the only thing we have to do and then we will have our AI ready.

53
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,680
So let's make this final step in the next tutorial and until then enjoy I.
