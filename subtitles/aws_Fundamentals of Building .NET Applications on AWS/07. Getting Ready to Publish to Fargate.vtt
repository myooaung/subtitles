00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.560
[Autogenerated] Now that we know this app does indeed work

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.530
when running inside a docker container,

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.070
it's time to send the container to the cloud.

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.500
Well, that's not really quite how it works.

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.470
The container is a running instance of the image,

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.400
so we'll send the image to the cloud and let AWS fargate take care of

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.640
spinning up in managing the container instances.

8
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.710
But it's always the same image.

9
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.840
So wherever Docker is running an instance of the image,

10
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.420
it's always the same exact thing.

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.420
An image with the A S P net core runtime,

12
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.060
including the Kestral server and my S P Net core application.

13
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.540
The image has everything it needs to run the up wherever we send it to.

14
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.970
The tool kit has a wizard that will walk you through

15
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.840
some configurations for the deployment, and then when you trigger the publish,

16
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.840
it will send those settings to fargate,

17
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.640
which responds by creating all the resource is defined by those settings.

18
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.320
Then, back on your computer,

19
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.910
the toolkit will push your docker image to the E C R.

20
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.910
And then fargate will provision and manage containers from that image so

21
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.360
we'll start by running the wizard provided by the toolkit start by right

22
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.250
clicking on the project and this time notice there's an option above the

23
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.190
published A Beanstalk item that we used earlier.

24
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.740
It's published Container to AWS.

25
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.120
This doesn't say anything about using Fargate,

26
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.900
but that comes as an option in this wizard.

27
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.780
You'll be filling out a few pages of configurations,

28
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.140
which will go through slowly in the next clip.

29
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.540
Most of them will already default to the correct options.

30
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.850
I know the first time I did this it felt like a bit of an effort,

31
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.000
but that was because everything was new and I wanted to

32
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.260
know what each and every option was for.

33
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:51.000
But now that I've done it many times, for me it does seem like a breeze, so hopefully that'll be your experience as well.
