[Autogenerated] Hello.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.410
Welcome back to fundamentals of building dot net

3
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.390
applications on AWS I'm Julie Lierman.

4
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.660
In the previous module,

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.270
we deployed our A s p dot net core application to AWS but discovered

6
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.290
that we also need to get the database credentials,

7
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.170
which should definitely not be hard coded into the application onto AWS

8
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.440
so that the deployed application has access to them.

9
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.940
And that's the goal of this module.

10
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.080
First, I'll give you a quick overview of the options we have on AWS.

11
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.830
Then once I explain what's behind my choice of those options

12
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.120
which is the AWS Systems manager parameter store.

13
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.910
But go ahead and create those secrets on AWS.

14
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.970
And with those available, we can return to the APP,

15
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.210
remove the hack that I left in place at the end of the last module and set up

16
00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.160
the application to read those cloud based secrets both when debugging in visual

17
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.800
studio and from the deployed application on AWS,

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:14.000
then weaken republish the AB and see it truly working with no hacks on AWS. So let's get started
