1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,640
[Autogenerated] and we're Beck.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,410
Now that the database instance has been created,

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,230
the tool kit shows that it's available with a little

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,500
green dot instead of yellow one.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,740
And the only thing the log shows is that the instance was

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,920
created and what time it was created.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,570
I've enabled all of the possible columns in the grid using

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,320
this show hide function and one of the pieces of info Here is

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,140
the end point of the database.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,340
That's what we'll use as the server name when it's time to connect,

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,940
there's a context menu associated with the instance,

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,020
and you can get to it from the grid or by clicking on the instance in the AWS.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,180
Explorer will look at the 1st 1 Add two server Explorer shortly,

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:46,080
but I want to focus now on the modify DB instance option that lets

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,370
you change some of the facets of the DB instance.

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,220
But not all of the things you can set up when you create it.

17
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,520
The details you can effect here are the amount of storage,

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,490
the master password for the instance, the parameter and security groups,

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,070
which are more advancing.

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,450
What we care about for this course and on the next page.

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,470
You can change your mind about the automated backups and sister

22
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,310
maintenance if you want the last pages just to review again,

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,390
and I'm not going to change anything here so I'll just close this window.

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,360
I think the most common mistake you might make when creating the

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,660
database instance at least the one I made numerous times is missing

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,520
that public accessibility check box.

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,470
You can't fix that in the tool kits, modify instance options.

28
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,310
So let's go to the console to take a quick look at what's there in the console.

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,730
The list of the instances also shows Theophile ability and some

30
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,440
other high level info about the database usage.

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,800
And in case you're wondering,

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,630
I did verify that the instance was working and

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,980
accessible before jumping in here.

34
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,140
So that's why it's already showing some activity.

35
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,210
If you drill into the database instance,

36
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,820
there's a lot more information,

37
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,200
the kind of details you'd want to see for managing a database server,

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,730
things like monitoring and logs.

39
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,870
Another common thing you might want to change is what I P

40
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,430
addresses are allowed to access the database that's managed by

41
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,250
the security group that was created for the VPC that AWS

42
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,140
created for hosting the database.

43
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,140
Instance.

44
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,510
And you can drill into that from the security section of this page.

45
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,250
There's a security group, and I'll click on it.

46
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,630
And on the details for the security group,

47
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,380
there's info about inbound and outbound rules.

48
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,020
If I click on inbound rules,

49
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,830
you can see that the toolkit set up a sequel server rule with the

50
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,460
default Port 14 33 allowing my I p address access,

51
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,250
by the way, because I didn't know what this was.

52
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,300
That slash 32 after the I P address is referred to as a cider block.

53
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,170
That's C I.

54
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:46,430
D E.

55
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,060
R.

56
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,790
And the cider block code 32 means that Onley this I p address.

57
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,720
Here's a nice explanation of that.

58
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,340
From Stack Overflow.

59
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,470
You'll find a link to this page in this modules.

60
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,960
Resource is, if you got a dynamic I p address,

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,170
you might need to come in here and edit the rules to change that.

62
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,530
I p Address Changing aspects of the instance itself means

63
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,830
that you need to modify the instance and everything you

64
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,660
specified before you can modify here,

65
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,720
including if I scroll down the public accessibility.

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,170
And again, I've mistakenly forgot to mark that check box a few times,

67
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,610
So I've had to come here and update the instance.

68
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,140
One other important point to be aware of is that by default,

69
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,730
any changes you apply and save here won't be made until the next

70
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,840
scheduled maintenance window for the instance.

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,890
And on that second page, you can schedule your changes to happen immediately,

72
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,600
and that's perfectly fine for testing.

73
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,840
But if you're working with the production database,

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,460
you'll need to be more careful,

75
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:59,000
and you'd also need to learn a lot more about RTs anyway. Again, I'm not making any changes, so I'll just click cancel here.
