00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.090
[Autogenerated] If you've never used Docker in development before,

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.840
I do want to be sure you've got your computer and visual studio set up properly.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.440
First,

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.360
it's critical that you have docker installed on your

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.680
development machine the normal path for developers.

6
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.290
And what I use is just to install the Docker desktop application.

7
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.310
There are versions for Windows, Mac OS and Lennox,

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.590
and it's free, and it also includes a you I called the Doctor Dashboard.

9
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.550
There are a few things to be aware of If you've never used this before.

10
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.920
First, don't be afraid,

11
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.440
Doctor can seem daunting to someone who's never used it before.

12
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.530
I was in this boat for years, but once I had my ah ha moment,

13
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.320
I became a quick fan and I even became a doctor captain.

14
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.610
And we won't be doing anything too complicated here.

15
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.990
So I have great faith in you, so come on along for the ride.

16
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.600
Next on Windows, you'll need hyper V running.

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.210
I personally have also use virtual box on my computer sometimes,

18
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.810
and I have to disable hyper V and reboot for that.

19
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.090
Then, when I'm done,

20
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.700
re enable hyper V and reboot again so I can get back to working with Docker.

21
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.960
All of this because software that runs virtual

22
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.340
machines hand run alongside of hyper V.

23
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.870
The last bit of advice is to understand that doctor can run

24
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.610
Lennox containers or Windows containers.

25
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.840
Windows containers are mostly for hosting your old Windows

26
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.530
applications and are much more cumbersome.

27
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.360
The Doctor desktop app Can Onley support one type of container at a time,

28
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.780
and we do want Lennox, which is the default.

29
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.890
There is a simple setting on doctors Notification Window menu to switch

30
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.880
back and forth between Windows and Lennox containers.

31
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.300
If you need to do that.

32
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.890
So for our purposes,

33
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.420
please do be sure that it's set up to support Lennox Containers.

34
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.700
With all of that in place, let's turn our attention to visual studio.

35
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.950
There's a visual studio component called the Container

36
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.390
Development Pools that you do need install if you're building asp

37
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.030
dot net core applications in visual studio.

38
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.490
You probably already have that installed because it's part of the A s p dot net

39
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.380
and Web development workload in the visual studio installer.

40
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.770
And if you're using visual studio code,

41
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.000
there's a wonderful doctor extension created by Microsoft that you can use a swell
