1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,740
[Autogenerated] the last task and the transformation is just clean up any

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,810
code that's related to that s three proxy controller.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,190
That's in some of the files we copied over.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,210
It doesn't hurt to leave it there.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,500
But if you use this project as a reference point in the future,

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,040
that extra code could cause unneeded confusion.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,790
Why not just aim for clean code here?

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,370
I'll start with a serverless template file since it's already open.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,480
And keep in mind that you do need to be really diligent about grabbing

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,190
the correct sets of races and commas when doing this,

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,740
or you'll really muck up.

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,550
The Jason Visual studio can help you see which braces

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,800
are paired by selecting opening brace,

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,160
and then it will highlight the closing brace.

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,540
Or, if you collapse a section,

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,740
then you can be sure to get the full thing when you delete it.

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,540
The first chunk ago is this section called Parameters,

18
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,510
and that's all about the S three proxy.

19
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,740
So we'll delete that,

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,520
and the same goes for the section called Conditions Inside of the A S P.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,070
Net core function section.

22
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,740
There's a subsection that we can also get rid of,

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,500
and that's the one called Environment.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,490
And again, be sure you get the comma that's right before events.

25
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,420
The next section you can believe is called Bucket,

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,950
and you'll want to get rid of the common that's above this section because

27
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,070
there's no more subsections that air following and finally,

28
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,800
inside the outputs section weaken believe this

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,990
section called S three Bucket Proxy.

30
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,990
And again, don't forget the comma that precedes this section.

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,210
Now the Serverless template class is much cleaner and a lot easier to read,

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,490
and we can do the same for the Lambda Tools file.

33
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,650
That's the one that has the deployment settings,

34
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,630
and I bet you can already see what needs to go.

35
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,340
It's the S three prefix property and the template parameters property.

36
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,560
And since template parameters was at the end,

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,640
don't forget to delete that leftover comma that was before it.

38
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,460
So that's all the changes we need to make.

39
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,080
We pop it over some files we copied over code.

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,110
We fixed a name space.

41
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,240
We Addison policies or function would have correct permissions,

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:26,000
and we got rid of all of the extraneous settings related to that sample controller in the template generated project
