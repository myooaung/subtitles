00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,120
[Autogenerated] before moving on.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,160
I want to be sure you see the AWS tool kits for visual

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,560
studio code and JETBRAINS Rider in case this is where

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,240
you'll be doing your development.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,960
This will just be a quick peek,

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,740
since this course will focus on using the toolkit for visual studio.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,010
Both of these ideas are cross platform.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,410
So just for fun,

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,720
I'll show them to you on my Mac book instead of in

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,020
Windows in visual studio code.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,420
You can get the AWS toolkit from the extensions tab,

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,690
and there are a lot of extensions when I filter on AWS.

13
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,100
But happily, the tool kits on top of that list,

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,240
this tool kit is focused on services related to building serverless functions,

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,100
so all that's currently available on the Explorer are notes for cloud formation,

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,850
Lambda Schema AS and step functions.

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,900
There are also a lot of commands available.

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,200
Here's the beginning of the list of AWS commands in the command palette.

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,130
The toolkit to install for Jetbrains.

20
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,540
Rider is in fact, a toolkit that installs in tow.

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,200
A number of jetbrains i d es.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,770
You can find it by going to the plug in settings for the I.

23
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,250
D.

24
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,090
then filter on AWS.

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,720
And there it is, the AWS Toolkit.

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,040
After installing it, the AWS Explorer will be available in the I d.

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,350
And in addition to the nodes we saw in the V s Code Toolkit,

28
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,880
there are also notes for managing elastic container services.

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,690
That's E C S and S three, which is a W s simple storage service.

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,280
Get it?

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,460
Three s is simple storage service.

32
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,000
So s three. Very clever.
