00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.860
[Autogenerated] the best way to see what comprises a dot net

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.230
serverless application is by creating a brand new application

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.640
that has minimal distractions in it.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.360
So let's start with that before heading to the A p I we've

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.100
already been working with Start by creating a new project and

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.030
from the templates filter on AWS,

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.450
you might be surprised to see that there are a number of AWS templates.

8
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.240
What we want is one of the serverless templates.

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.450
I definitely need to use C Sharp, not F sharp.

10
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.610
I'm not really adept with F Sharp.

11
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.360
So that brings it down to two options, one of which includes tests.

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.510
I'm choosing the one without test,

13
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.700
which is a ws serverless application dot net core c sharp.

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.010
Then I'll give it a name, specify location and click create,

15
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.310
but we're not done yet.

16
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.370
Now you get to choose from a list of what they call

17
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.710
blueprints for different flavors of templates.

18
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.620
Summer samples like this detect image labels,

19
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.740
but the blueprint we want is the a s p dot net core Web guy.

20
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.180
And again, thanks to my screen resolution,

21
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.120
you can't see the entire name, so be sure to check the description.

22
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.480
It says Sir Ellis A s p dot net core Web ap I.

23
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.000
That's the one I want. Now I'll go ahead and let Visual Studio create the project from this template.
