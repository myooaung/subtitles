[Autogenerated] AWS has a lot of options for data storage,

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.540
but we'll focus here on relational databases,

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.940
and the relational data support is managed through a service called R.

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.410
D s for relational database service.

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.250
Within RDS, you can create database instances for a number of different engines.

6
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.210
But regardless of which engine you choose you can use,

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.150
RTs is common mechanisms for optimizing,

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.040
scaling and managing these instances and the databases within them.

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.340
There are five common relational database engines supported by RDS.

10
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.210
Post GREss Que El, my sequel, Maria DB Oracle and Sequel Server.

11
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.560
There's another relational database service that's

12
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.710
proprietary toe Amazon called Aurora.

13
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.050
This is a specially built relational database that's

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.540
compatible with my sequel and post rescue L.

15
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.110
In fact, if you're using entity framework,

16
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.630
you can use the my sequel or post grad school providers to connect to it.

17
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.590
But Aurora is more heavy duty than using my sequel or post GREss directly.

18
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.240
The way AWS describes it is that you get the performance and

19
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.340
availability of a commercial great database at 1/10 the cost

20
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.390
because it's targeting my sequel and post GREss.

21
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.450
It's an interesting option to be aware of,

22
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.760
but it's not available in the free tier,

23
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.080
so I'll be using sequel server through RDS in these demos and not Aurora.

24
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.610
RDS is available as part of the free tier,

25
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.070
and it gives you 750 hours a month of RDS usage.

26
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.090
But there are a few aspects of using RTs in the free tier to be aware of first,

27
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.240
that 750 hours a month on Lee lasts for 12 months.

28
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.240
Hopefully, you'll finish this course before quickly than that.

29
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.650
You'll also be limited in the compute power assigned to your server instances,

30
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.220
as well as the amount of storage, which is 20 gigabytes.

31
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.660
There's one other interesting option for RDS databases,

32
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.670
which is currently in preview and only available for my sequel and post GREss.

33
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.360
And that's the Amazon RDS proxy,

34
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.930
which can automate database connections between your

35
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.740
applications and databases within RTs.

36
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.000
We won't be using in this course, but it's an important feature to be aware of for your future reference
