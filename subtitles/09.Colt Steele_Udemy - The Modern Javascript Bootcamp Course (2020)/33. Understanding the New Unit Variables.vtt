00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.160
All right.

2
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:01.850
Let's get to it.

3
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.330
We're going to start to discuss in the different variables we need to change inside of here to get our

4
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.720
map to display correctly so quick diagram.

5
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.600
So this is the kind of maze we want to allow the user to have now.

6
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.620
I want to not only allow the entire canvas to be rectangular but I want the number of cells in the horizontal

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.140
and vertical direction to be able to vary as well.

8
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.750
So we're going to introduce two new variables that are going to replace these single cells variable

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.110
that we have right now.

10
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.840
Remember cells right now tells us the number of cells we want to have both in the horizontal and vertical

11
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:41.030
direction but now I want to go to have a variable number in the horizontal and vertical instead.

12
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.030
So we're going to introduce a variable called cells horizontal

13
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.450
in this case it would be equal to four because I want to have one two three four cells going from left

14
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.490
to right.

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:04.790
We're also going to have cells vertical and in this case as you would guess one two three let's create

16
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.600
both those variables right now and we'll discuss exactly how we're going to actually use them.

17
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.580
It's a back over here.

18
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.660
I'm going to remove the cells variable and I'm going to create cells horizontal I'll start it off as

19
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:25.130
four and cells vertical and I'll start that off as three the next variable I want to point out to you

20
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.940
is unit length right here.

21
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.300
Remember that was supposed to be the length of one side of a given cell either the height or the width

22
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.580
because they were always identical now that we are allowing or a very different number of cells in the

23
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.820
horizontal and vertical direction and the actual screen space allocated to this can be variable as well.

24
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.590
We need to calculate the horizontal difference or distance of a cell differently from the vertical height

25
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.720
of a cell.

26
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.630
So we're going to introduce two other variables as well.

27
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:07.430
One will be unit length X and the other will be unit length y.

28
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.990
And as you would guess that's going to be the x direction or the width of a cell and the height of a

29
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.010
cell we can calculate both these by taking advantage of the height and width of the overall canvas and

30
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.710
dividing that by the number of cells on the horizontal and vertical direction tobacco over here.

31
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.200
I'm going to change the existing unit length to unit length y and then to calculate that we're going

32
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.780
to take the overall width of our canvas and divide by the number of cells in the horizontal direction.

33
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:49.060
So that is cells horizontal don't say cells horizontal like so then for the unit length in the y direction

34
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.530
I'll create unit length Y and that's going to be the overall height of the canvas divided by cells.

35
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.030
Vertical and that's pretty much it.

36
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.920
Okay so now that we've established the meaning of these different variables we're going to start to

37
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.010
go around this file and update all the different references we had previously to unit length or cells

38
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.740
to either use cells horizontal vertical or unit length X or Y Not refactor is going to be just a little

39
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.710
bit painful and I want to put all of it into one single video.

40
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.760
So how's right here.

41
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.050
Come back the next video and we'll do the entire refactor hopefully in one single go.
