00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.110
I want to very quickly tell you how to get a new API key if there's something wrong with the one that

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.950
was included inside this project.

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.840
So again if you're getting an error in your console or if you're not seeing any search results when

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.630
you make a request we're going to go in and generate a new API key and add it into this project to do

5
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.980
so.

6
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.530
We're going to open up a new browser tab and navigate to OMD API dot com once a year.

7
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.470
We're going to find at the very top a tab called API key we're then going to change Account Type 2 free

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.110
and then you can enter in an email a name last name and the user right here you can put in just about

9
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.910
anything you want.

10
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.030
Doesn't really matter once you do that it on summit you're then going to receive an email inside of

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.100
your inbox.

12
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.540
In your email take a look very closely at it.

13
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.190
There's going to be a link inside there that you need to click to make sure you click that link.

14
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.120
You're then going to get your API key once you get the API key.

15
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.070
We will come back over to our index not just file.

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.670
This is inside of the new project that we just downloaded not the project we are just working on with

17
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.210
the map.

18
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.070
And for each and whatnot then inside of here We'll scroll down just a little bit and find right there

19
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.470
is something says API key.

20
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.370
So take the API key that you found in your email pasted in right there.

21
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.730
Save the file and you should be good good to go so you can then flip back over to the application.

22
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.490
Make sure you refresh it and then type in another movie title and you should see something like that

23
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.640
appear OK.

24
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.350
So now hopefully your application is working and we are ready to start testing it really quickly however

25
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.970
I want to mention some of this application and just generally how it works and I'm just going to mention

26
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.050
this in case you did not build this app with me earlier on site of course.

27
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.570
So just you know this the point this entire application is to search for somebody on the left and then

28
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.060
some of you on the right and then once you search for movie on both sides the movie with the higher

29
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.450
statistics in each of these different categories is going to be highlighted.

30
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.470
So in this case the Dark Knight got more awards but The Avengers had a higher box office value and The

31
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.550
Dark Knight had a higher medal score a higher rating and more votes on IMDB com as well so that pretty

32
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.260
much is the application.

33
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.250
So we're going to take a pause right here just in case you skip this video because you already knew

34
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.030
all this stuff and we come back next video we're going to start to discuss how we can test all this

35
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.990
stuff using Moka so quick pause and I'll see you in just a moment.
