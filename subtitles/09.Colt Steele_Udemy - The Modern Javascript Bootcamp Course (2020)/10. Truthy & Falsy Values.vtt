00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.700
Now that we've seen conditionals we can talk about this kind of odd topic truthiness and falseness or

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.510
truth and false values all that this is is that every value in JavaScript has an inherent truthiness

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.650
or false ness about it.

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.510
It doesn't mean it is truth or true or it is false.

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.720
There's only two values true and false that are actually true and false.

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.780
Those are the billions but every value has a truth or falsity ness to it.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.520
And let me show you what I mean.

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:38.070
If we were to write a conditional like if let's make a variable called Mystery let's do let's mystery

9
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.200
equals five and then we'll add a conditional of if mystery just mystery not mystery equals anything

10
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.490
just.

11
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.290
If mystery will counsel that log.

12
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.960
Truth.

13
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.020
And then else we can control that log false see

14
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.800
I'm not sure if falsely is spelled like that or that's not really the technical term but anyway we are

15
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.290
just checking this single condition.

16
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.140
If mystery which is right now set to five if that is true thi this would print if it's not truth admitting

17
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.820
it's false See this footprint.

18
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.450
Let's see what we get we get truth.

19
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.490
So the number 5 is a truth value.

20
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.900
In fact every number that you could possibly choose except for zero is truth.

21
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.220
You can see zero is fallacy.

22
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.930
The only caveat to that is not a number which we've seen a couple of times that is also falsely so something

23
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.920
like a zero divided by zero is going to give us not a number.

24
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.250
Refreshing and we still see false see almost every single value in Javascript is truth.

25
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.910
Except for these right here.

26
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.380
So the actual value of false of course is false see zero as we just saw it is false see empty string

27
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:06.020
so there's no space in there it's just an empty string like this that is false see no undefined and

28
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.190
not a number.

29
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.360
Everything else excluding these everything else is truth.

30
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.450
Now why does this matter.

31
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.720
Why should you really care.

32
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.460
It's not just a little piece of trivia to know.

33
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.390
Often you'll see people use this strategy if some variable do something not mystery but something like

34
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.870
this.

35
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:35.720
If let's say current user or logged in user then console out log something like you are logged in.

36
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.020
Else console that log please log in.

37
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.160
OK so something like this is pretty common maybe not consoles out logging but displaying a certain page

38
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.030
showing the sign in button versus the sign out button.

39
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.090
We're just checking if a variable is truth.

40
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.630
So if we define let logged in user end it set to.

41
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.150
I don't know Thomas.

42
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.710
1 2 3.

43
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.030
We're going to see you are logged in.

44
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:15.770
But if it is not said to anything like undefined please logged in please log in or if it's set to know

45
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.000
it should be another option please log in.

46
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.910
Same thing if we had a string for somebodies name username we could write if user name and if that username

47
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.150
is still an empty string then that code would not run if it was anything else in that string it would

48
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.410
run.

49
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.960
So this is just a small side topic but you will see this pretty frequently.

50
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.890
Checking for a value we're not checking to see if it's equal to something in particular we're seeing

51
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.330
if it's truth which usually is a way of checking if something has content if it exists.

52
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.880
If it's not no undefined 0.

53
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.830
False.

54
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.030
Empty string or not a number.

55
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.110
Anything else will pass this condition.
