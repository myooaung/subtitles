1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,880
There's one less fix I want to take care of very quickly.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,460
Right now if we do a search for something so like I'm going to search for Avengers.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,640
Whoops I accidentally lose it.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,870
There we go.

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:16,360
And then I delete this the input stays open or excuse me the dropdown stays open but with nothing inside

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:16,720
of it.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,010
Which is definitely not appropriate.

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,870
So we just need to make sure that we do a little check inside of our code and we say that if we get

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,140
back no results at all from our fetch data function we should probably close the dropdown.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,460
So we just spoke about how we open and close the dropdown so that should be pretty straightforward back

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,830
up right after we check to see if we are swimming right after we get some data.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,480
Let's take a look at movies.

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,020
We're gonna say that if there are no movies whatsoever.

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:48,050
If we didn't fetch any data let's just return early and not run anything else inside of here so I'm

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,310
going to say if not movies star link.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,140
So if there are no movies then let's make sure that we close the dropdown.

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:06,040
So going to do a dropdown class list dot remove is Dash active and then we're going to return entirely

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,000
from this function.

19
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:13,060
We don't want to try to render anything or even open the dropdown back up or anything like that.

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,200
So that's pretty much it.

21
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,410
Let's do a quick save and a test.

22
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,130
We want to once again search for Avengers and I'll delete it.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,290
In the dropdown goes away All right let's say that's looking pretty good.

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,750
So our autocomplete widget is now in a really good state and there's really only one last major interaction

25
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,770
we have to add.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,650
We need to make sure that a user can actually click on a video to select it.

27
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,920
Right now we can click on a video all day but nothing is really happening so let's take a quick pause

28
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,710
and handle that last major interaction in the next video.
