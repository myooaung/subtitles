00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.260
In this video, we're going to make sure that we disable gravity inside of our maze.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.590
Again, that's going to make this ball just a little bit easier to control.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.930
So to disable gravity, I'll go back over to my editor and go to the very top.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.020
And I went to find where we create the engine right here.

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.610
So in order to disable gravity, we're going to change a property on that engine variable.

6
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.810
We'll say engine dot, world dot, gravity dot y equals zero.

7
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.440
Like so.

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.690
That's going to disable gravity in the Y direction entirely.

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.000
Now, if we go back over and refresh the ball, it's just going to stay where it is until we start to

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.880
apply some velocity to it so I can tap on the button.

11
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.510
And now I go to left, right, up, down.

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.510
And now it's a little bit easier to control than it was before.

13
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.500
It's still kind of challenging to control because the ball starts to move like really quickly.

14
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.390
But we'll start to address that over time.

15
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.140
Eventually, you're going to realize that having the ball kind of responsive is actually kind of nice

16
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.060
when we have a really large maze and it takes up essentially the full width and height of our screen.

17
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.400
So eventually we can add in some tweaks to make sure we don't accelerate the ball or set the velocity,

18
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.300
the ball quite so high.

19
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.310
But again, we'll take care of that in just a little bit.

20
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.800
OK, so this definitely works.

21
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.240
It's now the very last thing we really need to do to complete the entire game is to make sure that when

22
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.480
the ball presses that completion block right there, we essentially end the game and say, hey, congratulations,

23
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.590
user, you just won.

24
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.320
That's the last major feature we need to add in.

25
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.250
So quick pause.

26
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.630
Take care of that in just a moment.
