1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,430
You've now got the full sign up process put together so a user can go to the form right here see the

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,750
form on the screen submit the form and then create a brand new account.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,470
But there's still two other interactions we need to put together.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,720
We need to make sure that a user can sign out of our application.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,180
We also need to make sure that once they sign out they can sign back in as well.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,900
So let's get started putting that additional functionality together.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,540
The first thing I want to do is first add in some different root names.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,400
The two routes so we currently have.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,620
Right now we show these sign up form at our root root.

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:38,010
It's going to change the initial abduct get right here to sign up instead.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,860
Now whenever a user goes to local those 3000 slash sign up they'll see the sign up form also change

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,880
the submission right here to a app dot post slash sign up as well.

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,680
Now if we save that and we go back over and I try to navigate to Local three thousand we'll see an error

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,340
message.

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:01,940
So moving forward if you want to sign up to our application you have to go to slash sign up once I go

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,140
there I can still see the original form okay.

17
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,500
Now we've got some better you or else put together.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,650
Let's also add in some sign out functionality so to sign out.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:20,460
I'm gonna go down to right above our app don't listen line and I'll add in a app does get sign out and

20
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,810
points.

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,760
So if anyone ever makes a request to slash sign out we're going to try to sign them out of our application

22
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,140
and then we will redirect them back to the sign in roots or something like that so inside of here if

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,200
you want to sign out our user all we have to do is essentially tell the user or their browser more specifically

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,310
to forget all the information that is stored inside their cookie.

25
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,780
Because remember the information side the cookie is what alone proves that someone is authenticated

26
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:55,580
with our application so in order to log them out we're going to receive reckoned rez then we're going

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,230
to say it record session is equal to no.

28
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,950
That essentially is going to take whatever their current session object is and more or less forget it.

29
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,850
So now whenever cookie session takes a look at the rec dot session property remember we are using the

30
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,780
cookie session for managing our cookie.

31
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,290
It's going to see that we set it to null and that is a sign that we want to forget all the information

32
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:21,110
stored inside the cookie so when a user makes a request to slash sign out the response we sent back

33
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,000
is going to have a set cookie property inside of it that says clear out any cookie data you currently

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:37,250
have in addition to saying the record session right there we'll also send back you are logged out here.

35
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,240
Let's test that out really quickly.

36
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,970
I'm gonna go back over and navigate to a local host 3000 slash sign out.

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,070
It's now told you are logged out.

38
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,600
Also very interestingly if you have your network console open you can click on the request we just made

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,830
inside of here you'll see Response Headers and we now have a set cookie that says Express call in session

40
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,700
equals nothing.

41
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,920
So we are essentially telling the browser we now want you to store no information inside the cookie

42
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,750
at all.

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,390
So that's how we're going to sign out.

44
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,210
If we now go back to our sign up route so slash sign up will now see that our ideas undefined because

45
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:18,650
we no longer have any session information about the person who is making requests to our server.

46
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:25,840
Now let's also put together these sign in route that I'll go right underneath our sign out and I'll

47
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:34,010
add in an app not get sign in so remember just like sign up.

48
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,070
This is going to be a two step process.

49
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,760
We first need to send a form to the user that they can use to enter their email and password when a

50
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,770
user submits the form.

51
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,480
We need to create a post request handler to handle that form submission.

52
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,180
So inside of it getting sign in right here that means we want to show the form to the user.

53
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:57,190
So inside of here I'll do a resort sent we'll do a multi line string so don't forget your back ticks.

54
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:05,700
Then go up to our current form and I'm just going to copy all this HD e-mail right here.

55
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,080
I'll go back down.

56
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:14,360
I'm gonna paste our HD in I'm going to delete the line that says your I.D. is blah blah blah.

57
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:20,270
I'm also going to delete the password confirmation as we don't need a password confirmation when we

58
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,430
are just signing in.

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,640
And then on the button element I'll change the text to say sign in instead of sign up

60
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:28,840
okay.

61
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,670
That looks good.

62
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,420
Let's save that.

63
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:38,070
Go back over and test it out so back inside my browser I'll navigate to slash sign in and there's my

64
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,930
sign and form.

65
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,630
It's now let's make sure we also have a post request handler to deal with this form being submitted

66
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:57,270
so I'll also put inside of here an app post flash sign in I'll receive rec in RES we're probably going

67
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,380
to have to look up some records inside of our user repository.

68
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,280
Second mark this function as async and then let's take a quick pause right here and we'll start to fill

69
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,500
out the implementation in just a moment.
