00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.480
Next up let's talk about something called The Math object.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.330
This is a relatively quick topic definitely not long enough to merit its own section and it kind of

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.690
has to do with the stuff we've been talking about primitives and numbers.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.830
The math object is a collection of different pieces of mathematical functionality along with some mathematical

5
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.940
constants.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.380
So you probably won't be using math dot pi very often or math dot E for Oilers number but they are available

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.940
to you.

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.020
Most of what we use or what I use the math object for are its methods.

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.330
So just like strings we have some common methods that we've talked about the math object has methods

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.980
like rounding or exponential Asian or finding absolute value one that will really use a lot is actually

11
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.450
random numbers which will come back to in a moment.

12
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.920
Let's start with a quick look at the math object.

13
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.780
We haven't really talked about objects at all.

14
00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.380
In this case think of the math object as just a collection of math functionality different pieces of

15
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.870
different actions that have to do with math and numbers in some way.

16
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.550
They're collected into this object called math and it does start with an upper case m if we tried out

17
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.160
with a lowercase M we won't get anything unless we use uppercase M.

18
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.590
Math is just there for us to use.

19
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.120
We have access to it.

20
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.390
And if I type math dots I can look at the autocomplete in my console and I'll see tons of different

21
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.390
methods different pieces of functionality.

22
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.970
So something like math dot Pi is not actually a method it's just a value.

23
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.430
I can look at probably not that useful.

24
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.220
Most of the time until you get to doing things with maybe geometry or some sort of game where you have

25
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.050
a collision detection radius around your space ship or something.

26
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.080
But some of the more useful methods in here include things like math dot floor which expects us to pass

27
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.040
in a number like three point six five seven and it while I use a comma there.

28
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.820
But it also works.

29
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.830
It's going to chop off the decimal point so it doesn't round.

30
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.510
I could have three point nine nine nine nine and a bunch of nines and I still get three as a result

31
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.480
it just chops that off but we also have math dot round and math out round does round.

32
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.100
So if I have math that round a four point six we get five but four point four is rounded down to four.

33
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:35.770
We also have math that POW math dot power where we can pass in two numbers like 7 and 2 and this will

34
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.750
take 7 and raise it to the second power or I could do 7 to the 7th Power and get a very large number.

35
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.750
Other than that let's see is there anything worth bringing up.

36
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:55.900
We've got tons of methods around trigonometry cosine and sine tangent arcs all this stuff we've got

37
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.150
some geometry getting the hypotenuse of a triangle we probably won't use most of those all that often

38
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.120
but there is one method that we will use a lot and it's really the main reason the motivation for me

39
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.390
even showing you the math object and that method is called Math dot random.

40
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.300
So math dot random is going to be used to generate random numbers for us which we do pretty frequently

41
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.860
depending on what you're actually doing in an application.

42
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.140
You may not generate random numbers if you're creating a chat app but in games or animations for example

43
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.340
randomness can be important when we call math dot random.

44
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.440
We don't pass anything into those parentheses what it does is it returns a Random decimal between 0

45
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.610
and 1 but not including 1.

46
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.040
So if we want a random number from 1 to 10 for example we have to transform it in a couple different

47
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.630
ways.

48
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.890
We have to work it into the form we want.

49
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.230
We use this random decimal as a seed but then we take advantage of some other methods and some other

50
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.460
operators to get the random number into a workable form.

51
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.370
Here's a step by step breakdown.

52
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.390
Let's say I'm trying to get a random number from 1 to 10.

53
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.590
I start with math at random that gives me a random decimal as we just saw from 0 to 1 not including

54
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.250
1.

55
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.590
Then we multiply it by 10.

56
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.220
So now we have a random number with a decimal going from zero all the way up to nine point 9 9 9 9 9

57
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.120
9 9 9 9 9 9.

58
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.410
Then what we do is we floor it which we just saw a math top floor it chops off the decimal.

59
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.220
So that gives us a random whole number a random integer from 0 to 9.

60
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.610
And if we want to go from 1 to 10 then we simply add 1.

61
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.350
And usually we do this all in one line which looks like this.

62
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.920
If you're brand new to JavaScript this looks like a lot but it's something we do pretty frequently.

63
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.640
Usually with this same pattern we just change these values here.

64
00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:02.410
So if I was trying to simulate a dice or a die roll from one to six I would start with math at random

65
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.470
then I would multiply it by six.

66
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.880
So that gives me a random number with a decimal between zero and six not including six.

67
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.050
As you can see here we could went all the way up to five point nine.

68
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.540
It's theoretically possible to go to five point 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 and so on.

69
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:30.430
Then what we do after that is math dot floor the whole thing math dot floor which chops off a decimal

70
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.480
point it doesn't round it just removes that decimal.

71
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.700
So now we end up with a number from zero to 5.

72
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.850
So I just got five and eventually I'll get zero.

73
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.310
There we go zero to five.

74
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.240
Which I could use for a dice roll but most dice go from one to six.

75
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.930
So I could add one after that.

76
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.680
And now we've got five for one and eventually hopefully I hit six.

77
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.090
There we go.

78
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.880
So this can take a little bit of getting used to.

79
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.010
If you have experience with other languages other programming languages some of them will have a method

80
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.210
like random integer and you pass in to two numbers.

81
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.200
I want a random integer from 50 to 100 in JavaScript.

82
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.930
You have to do that yourself.

83
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.940
The only built in way of getting a random number is math at random which always gives us a decimal from

84
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.720
0 to 1.
