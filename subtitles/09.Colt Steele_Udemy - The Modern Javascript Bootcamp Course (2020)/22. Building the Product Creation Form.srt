1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,180
Let's start to focus on making sure that we can show a form to a user that they can use to create a

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,650
brand new product.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,880
So this is the form that we eventually want to create.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,910
We should have an input to receive the product name the price of the product and we should also have

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,450
a button on here that a user can use to upload an image as well.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,660
And of course a button to submit the form so to create this form right here.

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,410
We're going to go back over to our editor.

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,780
Remember because we want to generate some each team all to show this form.

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,970
We're going to create another file inside of our views directory.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,100
This file is going to be responsible for creating all the h t mail related to showing that form.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:43,360
So inside of my admin directory I'm going to make a new folder called products and then inside there

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,590
I'll make a file called new DOT J.S..

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:53,080
The reason I'm calling this new is because we are using it to create a new product then inside of new

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:02,710
J.S. we're going to first require in our layout for the admin pages which is up one directory.

15
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,680
I know that we're going to eventually have a forum.

16
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,370
And because of that we might eventually need to show some validation messages to a user as well.

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,750
So I'm also going to get that get error helper method we put together from that helpers file inside

18
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,020
of our route views directory.

19
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:22,150
So I'll say get error is going to come from up one up to helpers

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,190
after that will then do a module that exports we're going to export a function that's going to be called

21
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:36,420
with possibly some errors object or some object that contains an errors property.

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,130
And so once again this is going to be some errors object that is going to have some possible errors

23
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:48,030
that occurred when we tried to create a given product and instead of here we will return we want to

24
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,830
show some H email inside of our layout and remember our layout function is a function.

25
00:01:52,830 --> 00:02:01,260
So we're gonna call layout we're gonna give it an object that has a content property and that will be

26
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,150
a string and we're gonna put all of our each t Mel to show the form to the user inside of this multi

27
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,210
line string.

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,070
Once again remember multi line string.

29
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,510
So you need to have some back tricks on their okay.

30
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,240
So then inside of here let's start to put our form together.

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,860
Now let's again just like we did before the first iteration this form is going to have essentially no

32
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,700
styling tied to it at all.

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,390
There going gonna be a very simple looking form to show to the user.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,210
Once you put this entire feature together will then come back and apply some styling to it inside of

35
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:38,210
your old display a form going to make sure that I mark its method as post because we want to make a

36
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:43,310
post request whenever a user submits this form as opposed to the default behavior which is to make a

37
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:54,850
get request an inside I'll place an input with a placeholder of title that is the one little bit of

38
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,870
styling that we will do because we're not going have a label in this case.

39
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,650
I'll do a name of title then do another input.

40
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,760
I'll give it a place holder of price and a name of price

41
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,300
we then need some kind of input to receive the image that the user wants to upload to correspond or

42
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,370
represent this particular product they're trying to create in order to allow a user to upload a file.

43
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:29,960
We can place an input with a type of file and then I'm going to give the thing a name of image.

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,250
Now we're gonna go into pretty good detail around what that input right there is really doing and how

45
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,410
to work with a file upload.

46
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,230
So right now we'll just kind of leave this as is.

47
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,200
But we are going to come back and explain much more about what is going on there.

48
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,740
And then finally we need some kind of button to submit this thing.

49
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,250
So I'll just place a button and say submit okay.

50
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,100
So there is our form.

51
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,790
Now we can take this template.

52
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,200
We can go back to the product's root page that we were working on just a moment ago.

53
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,460
We're going to require in this template file and make sure that anytime that someone makes a request

54
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,030
to receive that form we're going to render this template and send it down to them.

55
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:15,550
So I'll go back to roots admin products dot J.S. and once inside of here at the very top I'm going to

56
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:22,350
get products new templates or something like that.

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,950
I think that that's a reasonable name.

58
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,440
So we're talking about products we're trying to get the template to create a new product.

59
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,680
So products new template.

60
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,130
I think that's pretty reasonable.

61
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,570
Then to require that we're going to have a pretty deeply nested requirement statement here.

62
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:41,060
It's gonna go up one directory droughts up another to the project directory.

63
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:50,150
Then I'll go into View's admin products new.

64
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,270
OK so now last step we're going to make sure that whenever a user makes they get requests to admin products

65
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,610
new we tend to show that template right there or produce some e-mail using it and then send that back

66
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:09,070
down to our user so inside of this request handler will do a red dot sent products new template

67
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,180
and once again we're going to provide just an empty object here.

68
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,470
Eventually when we call product's new template from our post request handler to receive the form submission

69
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:26,360
we will pass in a possible heirs object inside there but right now we'll just do an empty object.

70
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,610
All right.

71
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,790
So to test this out we're just gonna make sure that we can get some content on the screen.

72
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:36,240
So going to save this all then go back over to my application I'll go to a local host three thousand

73
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:45,630
admin products new and there's my form so yeah looks pretty ugly right now but hey it's at least a place

74
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,910
to get started so we're going to eventually enter in our title our price and then select a file using

75
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,000
this thing and then submit it to our back end server.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,240
All right.

77
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,540
So good place to get started.

78
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,160
So let's take a pause right here we'll come back the next video we're going to put together our post

79
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,960
request handler to handle a form submission.

80
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,120
We're going to make sure that we validate these inputs and also start to discuss how we're going to

81
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,860
handle image uploads as well.
