1
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.690
We got an SPG to show up.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.340
Let's now take a look at a couple of diagrams and understand how we work with them in general.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.330
OK here we go right here.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.380
So first things first.

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.680
Whenever we want to show a SPG or essentially some set of random shapes that we want to draw onto the

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.760
screen we're going to place an SPG element.

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.140
When we created SPG elements we're going to assign it a height and a width so you can see that we did

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.870
back that back inside the markup that we just put together right here.

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.950
So when we wrote that out it essentially created a big square inside of our small document.

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.850
That was to enter pixels tall junior pixels wide.

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.300
This SPG element is kind of like a canvas of sorts an honest canvas.

12
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.470
We can draw different shapes.

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.350
We can very easily see the SPG element in action.

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.870
If we go back over to our index start each small file use our element inspector and then hover over

15
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.340
the SPG so we can very easily see the full span of the SPG now.

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.690
So again this is kind of like a canvas of sorts.

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:06.800
We're kind of like an area we can draw as much stuff as we want to the SPG element has a couple of interesting

18
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.270
properties around it.

19
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.860
One of the most important things we need to understand is the axes that it has or those dimensions to

20
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.530
the top left corner of the SFE jail.

21
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.980
Assuming SPG element is what we refer to as the origin we're going to be working with a lot of coordinate

22
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.580
pairs.

23
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.450
So like x y values in order to place in size different shapes and sizes SPG elements all the coordinate

24
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.810
pairs that we are going to work with.

25
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.120
Use the origin of the top left hand side the X axes then increases from left to right and the y axes

26
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.220
increases from top to bottom so if we were to try to show some different points on here a point right

27
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.800
here might be at about one hundred seventy five pixels along the x direction.

28
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.180
So that means we go over a hundred and seventy five pixels from left to right and then 20 pixels in

29
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.040
the y direction.

30
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.060
So that means we go down from zero to 20 in the vertical direction then down here.

31
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.310
This would be one hundred and ninety pixels over to the right in one hundred ninety pixels down.

32
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.310
So again origin is always at the top left and we have our X axes running from left to right and the

33
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.250
y axis goes from top down to the bottom so we're going to very rarely for our application anyways have

34
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.140
negative x or y values because negative x or y would mean that we are trying to place a point outside

35
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.720
of our available area of the SPG.

36
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.180
So like out over here and that would not display inside the SPG for something to display.

37
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.760
It must have an X and Y coordinate within the bounds of our SPG right.

38
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.830
Now we've got Turner pixels wide and tall.

39
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.960
So in other words anything that we want to show up must be placed within zero to 200 on the X axes and

40
00:02:50.960 --> 00:03:00.440
zero to 200 on the y axis so that's a bit more about SPG elements and general now inside of an SPG element

41
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.170
we can place a variety of different other elements such as a circle and as you would guess this is going

42
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.770
to draw a circle out onto the screen.

43
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.300
There are several other shapes we can place as well so we can do a polygon which is essentially a shape

44
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.380
with an arbitrary number of sides.

45
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.640
We can do a circle which is what we just did.

46
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.030
We can draw and ellipse or a square or otherwise a rectangle.

47
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.180
We could also draw a path which is essentially a line that has some arbitrary and a direction to it.

48
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.580
So we can draw out a path kind of like curves and twists around as much as we please.

49
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.530
For our application as you probably guess we're going to end up drawing a circle so we're going to draw

50
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.770
a really big circle like so and we're going to place our timer text.

51
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.910
So like the countdown thing that text input all that kind of stuff is can be placed inside of the circle

52
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.090
and the circle itself.

53
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.310
There are a couple of different properties we need to understand.

54
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.060
These are pretty basic properties so r is the radius of the circle remember a radius is from the center

55
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.050
point out to a edge that is separate from the diameter which is the full distance from one edge to the

56
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.500
opposite edge.

57
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:20.500
So in this case we created a circle with a radius of 20 the C X and see y values are the center point

58
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.580
of the circle or where to place the circle on the SPG.

59
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.310
So in our case because we said see X and see y of 30 that meant that we could go back over to like this

60
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:38.150
diagram right here so we went over 30 units and then down 30 units and then we placed our circle.

61
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.500
The central point of it at that location so you can imagine 30 the 30 might be like right there or so

62
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.150
we can see that is plainly what happened inside of our drawing over here okay.

63
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.220
So that's some more about drawing a circle.

64
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.340
So now we want to we could easily play around with some of these are values and see X and see why.

65
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.730
So for example I can move my circle to the right by increasing these c x value that is going to increase

66
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.960
the x value where the central point of the x value for the circle.

67
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.080
So goods like 130 now expect to see this thing shift over by a hundred pixels.

68
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.350
Yep.

69
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.870
There we go.

70
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.380
I'm going to revert the C X to 30 and I'll try increasing c y to 130 as well.

71
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.210
So that should move our circle downwards by about a hundred pixels.

72
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.260
Yep definitely happen.

73
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.600
And then of course we can start to increase the r value so it can go up to say 120.

74
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.650
Now the radius of our circle is going to be significantly larger.

75
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.600
So now the circle is so large that actually flows off the SPG if something is outside the SPG it means

76
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.510
that we just plain can't see it.

77
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.470
So even though the circle is technically off the edge well we can't really see it because the SPG itself

78
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.030
is going to clip that OK.

79
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.840
So that is the SPG and the circle.

80
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.250
Now last thing I'm going to do I'm going to revert the circle back to an R of 20 a c x of 30 and a c

81
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:10.210
y 30 and then I'm going to copy paste the circle down twice then on the second one I'll change the C

82
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:19.270
X to 130 and on the third one I'll change the c y to 130 as well and so now I can see very easily three

83
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.710
circles on the screen.

84
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.190
So for us we're just going to show once circle.

85
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.970
But I just want you to know that we could show as many shapes inside of an SPG as we wish within reason

86
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.700
of course it's going to reduce this back down to just one circle like so.

87
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.970
All right.

88
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.040
So what we now understand some of the basics around drawing a shape inside of it as Fiji and some properties

89
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.650
around as Fiji is as well.

90
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.310
But now we need to understand how we can actually draw something like Well what we were going for before

91
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.060
this thing over here where we only see the outline of a circle.

92
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.560
In addition we want to make sure that we can kind of like have a line of sorts that goes around at the

93
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.020
same time.

94
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.970
We still need to understand a little bit more about how we're going to achieve that.

95
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.580
So a quick pause right here and I'll see you in just a minute.
