00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.740
All right.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.770
Let's continue working on our widget here.

3
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.920
Last we have to do is make a couple updates inside of an input to refer to the elements that we just

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.040
selected instead of some elements we just deleted actually.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.570
So like for example right now as we loop over all of our different movies and create some divs we're

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.980
trying to append them to document query selector idea of target.

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.570
So that element doesn't exist anymore.

8
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.680
Remember we said that we want to take all these different elements that we create and put them inside

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.880
of that div right there.

10
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.130
So we just have to update a couple of different references.

11
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.370
That's all OK.

12
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.650
So to get started right before the for loop we're going to take a look at the dropdown element as we

13
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.920
just discussed in the last video to make sure that we open up the menu.

14
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.400
We have to add the is active class to that element right there.

15
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.720
So right above the for loop I'll say dropdown that class list that add we're going to add on the class

16
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.540
is Dash active we're going to do that right after we fetch all of our data successfully.

17
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.370
So we're gonna fetch all of our data open up the dropdown and then add in all of our movies to it to

18
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.660
then inside of our for loop as I just mentioned this element right here doesn't exist anymore.

19
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.150
Instead we want to apply or append all these different divs that we create to the results wrapper and

20
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.660
the results wrapper is that thing right there So on the query selector I'm going to delete the query

21
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.540
selector and I will replace it with results wrapper.

22
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.340
All right just one or two more changes if we go back over to the boma documentation you'll recall that

23
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.260
as we show each individual item inside the dropdown they're supposed to be anchoring elements with a

24
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.500
class of dropdown item right now as we loop through all of our different videos or our different movies

25
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.550
we are creating a div element so that's not quite correct.

26
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.710
We need to update that to be an anchor element instead so to do so I'm going to update the document

27
00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.750
does create elements to make an anchor tag or a instead of div and then to be complete we should probably

28
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.730
update the div variable name since we're technically not creating a div anymore a name for this could

29
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.530
be like anchor because we are creating anchor element but that doesn't really convey the context of

30
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.270
the code we're writing here.

31
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.100
I personally kind of like the name option option might seem a little bit weird but the idea here is

32
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.560
that we are creating like a dropdown or in autocomplete and inside there we're going to show a lot of

33
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.130
different options of movies that a users can click to select one of these.

34
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.980
So I think the term option kind of makes sense in that context so I'm not going to go through it and

35
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.920
update div right there and right there as well to refer to the option variable since div doesn't exist

36
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.060
anymore we'll change that to option and on a pen child will change it to option as well okay.

37
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.730
Just one or two more quick changes inside of the option element.

38
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.490
We currently have the image which is definitely good but we have the movie text inside of an H1 which

39
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.320
might be just slightly too large.

40
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.040
So I'm going to take off the H1 the opening and the closing tag.

41
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.390
All right.

42
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.370
So there should be just one last little thing to do here right above the option element as we're just

43
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.370
looking at the ultimate documentation.

44
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.030
Remember I just said that we have to add in a class of dropdown item to get everything to styled nicely

45
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.130
the right above where we set enriched each team l.

46
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:30.480
I can also do an option class list not add dropdown dash item like so okay.

47
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.670
And that should be it.

48
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.500
It's going to save this and we should be ready to flip back over to our browser and test this out.

49
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.030
So I'm gonna go back over I'm gonna refresh and right away you're going to see that this looks a lot

50
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.550
better than how it looked before.

51
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.630
We've got the nicely bolded label and the input looks a lot better as well because we added in a class

52
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.410
of input to that thing it's now inside of here.

53
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:58.560
I'm going to do a search for Avengers and as soon as I do so I see this nice dropdown open and so I

54
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.260
can kind of hover over each of these.

55
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.220
I get the nice and a hover effect.

56
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.650
I got the nice finger right there all the styling that you're seeing here is coming from Boma so I know

57
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.270
that working with Bolt and having to understand this dropdown stuff was kind of probably annoying but

58
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.830
I think you can agree with me that this looks pretty awesome right here like this definitely looks really

59
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.750
good now as good as it looks there's definitely still some things we have to do to make our widget work

60
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.190
as expected.

61
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.870
In particular you might recall that we spoke about all the different ways in which our dropdown is going

62
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.760
to behave remember we had said stuff like Oh yeah.

63
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.330
If a user clicks outside the dropdown closed the menu.

64
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.950
Well right.

65
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.170
Now if I click outside the dropdown the thing stays open.

66
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.090
So definitely not appropriate.

67
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:48.950
In addition if I do another search so let's say that I look up Dark Knight I'm going to see as I scroll

68
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.460
down that all those results get appended to the very end of the list.

69
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.920
So we still have a little bit of work to do.

70
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.970
So let's take a quick pause right here and continue solving a couple of these little issues in the next

71
00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:59.330
video.
