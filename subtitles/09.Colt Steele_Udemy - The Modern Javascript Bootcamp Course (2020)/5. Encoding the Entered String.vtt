00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.630
Now that we understand the conversion process a little bit better.

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.630
I want to show you the function that we're going to use to do this conversion and then we'll start to

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.730
implement it inside of our form.

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.140
So I going to pull up my javascript console right here the function that is built into javascript that

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.490
we can use to do this conversion to us is called B to A.

6
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.460
So we call B to A with a string that we want to convert into a base 64 encoding.

7
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.620
So I'm going to put in the same string that we were using as a demonstration in the last video s e c

8
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.790
when I throw that in I get back the same stuff that we just saw in the last video.

9
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:41.410
C to capital B and J we then will have a b 64 string and we want to turn it back into normal characters.

10
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:50.490
We can call a to b and then pass in that same string or the base64 string and then we get back s e c

11
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.420
so B to A and A to B makes our life really easy especially for this application.

12
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.670
Let's now start to use the B to a function right there to take whatever text the user enters we're going

13
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.890
to encode it and we'll throw it onto into an input that will display on the screen that a user can easily

14
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.290
use to select that link copy paste enter at the front going to first go back over to my editor inside

15
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.910
of my index dot each email file I'm going to add in a little each team L that I'm going to display to

16
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.560
the user after they enter some text and then submit the form so right after the David class card panel

17
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.750
I'll find the closing date for that I'll give myself a little bit of space and then I'll open up a new

18
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.110
div

19
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:47.810
I'm going to put in share this link with a friend and then an input like so we're going to try to select

20
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.910
this input right here and put in the encrypted string do we want the user to share with their friends

21
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.530
just to make sure that it's really easy to select that input versus that input with the query selector

22
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.950
I'm going to add in an I.D. to the second input right here of link dash input again just to make it

23
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.890
easier to select I'll do the same thing with the first input as well I'll give that one an idea of message

24
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.470
dash input.

25
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.010
Again just adding the ideas on so we can select them very easily from our javascript code and not get

26
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.950
confused about which input is which will then go back over to my index dot J S file I'm going to first

27
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.930
update the selector that we used to get that input right there I'll change it to the idea that we just

28
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.880
added in so that is pound message dash input so we're then going to take the value out of it that's

29
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:50.650
input value and convert it into a base64 string they'll all say const encrypted is e to a base where

30
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.090
Sunni input die value there we go I'm then going to take that encrypted value and throw it into the

31
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.580
second input that we just created by first have to add in a selector for it so I'll do a document query

32
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.240
selector

33
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:16.300
hound link dash input and I'll set the value of it equal to encrypted it's let's save this and see how

34
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.230
we're doing gonna make sure I saved both those files go back to where the browser I'll refresh I see

35
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:31.060
the second input appear right there I'm going to throw in some text it creates and there's are base64

36
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.800
encrypted string we're going to eventually add in a little bit more text to this thing right here and

37
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.230
then user is going to select this copy it and share with their friend so quick pause right here and

38
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.850
we'll take care of that stuff in the next video.
