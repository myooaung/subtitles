00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,780
Attached to this video you're going to find a zip file called timer 0 2 5 templates a template in all

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,130
capitals.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,910
There are probably two different files attached to this lecture so make sure you get the one with the

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,550
name template inside.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,390
Once you get that file we're going to unzip it and then take a look at the two files inside.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,110
So we've got an index stored HDMI file and a style that CSX.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,190
So all I did we here was add in a couple of additional HD channel elements.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,450
Some class names and some C Ss just to apply a little bit better styling to our timer.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,300
The only reason I'm giving you this is that well this really is of course about JavaScript and so for

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,110
the most part we're going to skip over a lot of styling stuff.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,320
I still want you to have some neat looking apps though which is why we're usually going to have some

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,110
HD email and CSX being provided to you to use these files.

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:54,860
I'm going to open up my editor and I'm going to first begin by dragging and dropping the index not a

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,950
single file into my editor.

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,630
So here's the small file that we were just given.

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,920
I'm going to select everything inside of here with a command or control a depending upon your operating

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,030
system.

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,160
Copy everything.

19
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,130
I'm going to go back over to my index not a shelf.

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,200
So the one that we've been working on for our project going to select everything inside of here.

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:20,810
Delete it and then paste now as we look through here we're going to see just about everything is the

22
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,350
same.

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,930
So we still have a SPG element.

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,890
We still have a circle the input the buttons and all that stuff.

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,720
Just a slightly different structure.

26
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:37,610
Next up I'm going to create a new file called style Nazi SS.

27
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,590
I'll go back over to where we have those two files from the zip file.

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,890
I'll find the style CSF SS that we just downloaded.

29
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,150
I got a drag and drop it into my editor.

30
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,490
I'll select everything inside copy it and then paste it into the style that's the SS file that we just

31
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,710
created and save.

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,220
All right.

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,700
So now that everything is saved and updated all flip back over to my browser or refresh and we get something

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,040
looks like this right here.

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,800
If I zoom back out to 1 percent you'll probably see something it looks like basically that now I can't

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,530
click in here to run the timer.

37
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,740
It's all the exact same logic that we just had.

38
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,540
Nothing changed.

39
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,800
All the job script is identical because well we didn't change any of it right.

40
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,270
And now I can click on that thing.

41
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,910
It is the actual text input there so I can click on it and change it to say 30 seconds and then run

42
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,040
it down.

43
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,520
I can posit change it again to say 60 seconds.

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,770
Run it down and so on.

45
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,370
That's pretty much it.

46
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,440
Know what they want to really highlight is that that really is a text input.

47
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:44,560
The only thing we did with some C Ss was make sure that it doesn't display a border.

48
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,980
And it also doesn't get highlighted when you actually select it.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,860
So if I actually do a little bit of fancy stuff here really quickly you'll see that there is an outline

50
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,470
property being set inside the style that see SS file of none.

51
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,100
That's why it doesn't really look like an input but it technically is all right.

52
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,880
Well I hope you enjoyed this project.

53
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,490
We definitely learned a lot along the way about SB G's handling set intervals classes where to store

54
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,640
information in all that kind of stuff.

55
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,830
We still have a lot of code to write and a lot of projects to work on however.

56
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,200
So let's take a pause right here and start working on our next project in just a moment.
