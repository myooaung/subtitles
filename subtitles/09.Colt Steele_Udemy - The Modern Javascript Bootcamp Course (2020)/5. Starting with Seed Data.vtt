00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.410
We are all done with our admin panels.

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.030
Now is time to start to focus on the user experience or like the shopper experience.

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.650
So we need the ability to show out a list of products every product should have a button the user can

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.910
click to add it to a cart and then if a user clicks on the cart link up here at the top right hand side

5
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.300
we should show them a summary of all the different products they have.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.950
Now one key aspect of this is that we need to have a good number of products inside of here that a user

7
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.030
can shop over.

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.590
So just to give you a kind of realistic development experience I sat down and created a new product

9
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.040
Scott Jace on file which you will find inside of a zip file attached to this lecture.

10
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.970
The file that you're going to download is called something like AECOM 0 8 1 products template does it.

11
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.490
So if you extract that file you're going to find a product not just on file inside there.

12
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.210
There is about 10 or 15 or so products inside there that have some reasonable images attached to each

13
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.200
one along with a reasonable title and price.

14
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.800
So we're gonna use this as essentially the starting data set for showing out all these different products

15
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.310
and eventually adding them to the cart.

16
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.770
Now of course you don't have to use this product not just on file I put together.

17
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.420
I just put this together so we can have some somewhat realistic data to work with okay.

18
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.970
So once you get that file get then going to open up our code editor this time around rather than opening

19
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.860
up both files and doing a copy paste.

20
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.510
It's gonna be a just a little bit easier to just open up our project directory directly so here we go

21
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.050
whereas it.

22
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.740
Yeah.

23
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.620
There we go.

24
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.970
Wait.

25
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.590
Wrong window.

26
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.930
There we go.

27
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.450
So here is my products dot J's on file inside of my project directory.

28
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.350
I'm going to delete the existing one and then drag and drop the new one into my project directory.

29
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.640
Now if I open up that new products dot Chase on file I'm going to see something at the very top like

30
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.530
winter gloves touch screen compatible and you can scroll through and see that there are in fact several

31
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.610
items inside of here along with the base64 encoded image for each product as well okay.

32
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.190
So now that we have some data to work with.

33
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.370
Once you go back over to your admin dashboard you should see a listing like this right here so if you

34
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.680
want to certainly feel free to go through and edit some titles at it some prices and change some images

35
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.080
if you want to.

36
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.870
So let's pause here we'll come back the next video and we'll start working on listing out all of our

37
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.460
different products for our users.
