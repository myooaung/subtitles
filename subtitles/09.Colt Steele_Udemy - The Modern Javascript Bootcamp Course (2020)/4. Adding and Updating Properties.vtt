00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.980
Next up let's talk about how we add in new properties or update existing properties.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.300
So it's really similar to viewing a property or accessing the data.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.610
We have the dot notation or the square brackets.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.400
The only difference is we use an equal sign to assign a value either to update that value or to give

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.550
it an initial value.

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.140
So for example let's say I started out with an empty object called user reviews.

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.780
We're building some sort of web app where users can leave for views on something and at the beginning

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.330
when we first push our code up when we first launch the app there are no reviews so it's empty.

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.080
And then we want to associate a user name like Queen Bee for nine with a score of four out of five or

10
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.110
let's just do four or four point five or something.

11
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.030
And those will be coming in one at a time.

12
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.220
So we don't have all of the reviews at the start when we make user reviews so it will begin as empty

13
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.430
and we can add any of them in any property using the exact same syntax either dot notation or square

14
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.930
brackets.

15
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:09.190
We'll go with Queen Bee forty nine in square brackets and then we'll set it equal to 4.0.

16
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.060
And if we look at user reviews it contains Queen Bee forty nine as a key and for as a value we could

17
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.430
also use dot notation.

18
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.650
User reviews Dot.

19
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.310
Mr. SMITH Seventy eight equals three point five.

20
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.090
And again we take a look at user reviews and they are both in there.

21
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.960
So to add a property we don't have to do anything fancy.

22
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.760
We just access a property.

23
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.140
It doesn't exist.

24
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.740
It's set to undefined.

25
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.040
Right.

26
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.760
If I do user reviews of cold it doesn't find anything we get undefined so then we simply say OK we'll

27
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.240
take that cold key and give it the value of five I'm writing whatever we're rating I'm giving it five

28
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.370
out of five though for some reason I use the string there instead of a number which we can update so

29
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.370
to update something we do exactly the same thing.

30
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.060
User reviews and then dot or square brackets this time I'll do square brackets just to mix it up and

31
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.290
now I'll change it to the number five.

32
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.730
And if we look at user reviews we have all numbers.

33
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:22.060
Now we also have access to operations we've seen before like plus equals or the increment urinary operator.

34
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.630
So if I want to add two to Queen B I could do user reviews.

35
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:36.300
Square bracket Queen Bee forty nine and then plus equals two.

36
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.290
Well refresh we look at user reviews and we've now updated it to six.

37
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.730
So we can do plus equals.

38
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:52.280
If we can do plus plus if you wanted to user reviews dot Mr. Smith plus plus let's look at user reviews

39
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.130
and now it's 4.5 instead of three point five.

40
00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.100
So there's really just two sin taxes that we use over and over the square brackets dot notation whether

41
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.130
we're accessing a property that's already there or we are accessing it and updating it like we're doing

42
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.350
right here or we are setting it for the very first time like we do here and that's it.

43
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.940
That's all I want to talk about.

44
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.520
So you can have an empty object you don't have to have all of the properties defined when you create

45
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.950
it.

46
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.740
You can add them in after the fact.

47
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.650
Using this syntax.
