00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.810
All right so let's figure out our answer to problem number one.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.440
How are we going to somehow tie a cart to a person when they're never going to be logged in or anything

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.950
like that.

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.300
So here's the idea.

5
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.940
Here's how we're going to solve it at some point time.

6
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.630
A user who is using our application is going to click on that add to cart button.

7
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.000
So like this button right here we're going to have this button be wrapped inside of a little form element.

8
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.660
So whenever a user clicks on that button they're going to make a POST request to our server and inside

9
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.610
that post request we're going to have the idea of the item that the user wants to add.

10
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.440
So in this case we're going to imagine that maybe these gloves right here have an idea of one two three.

11
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.860
The browser is going to make that request of the backend server.

12
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.290
It's going to say I want to take product one two three.

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.290
I want to add it to my cart.

14
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.790
So then our Express server is going to have to figure out some way to take this product and associate

15
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.100
it with the person who just made that request.

16
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.740
That's the key here.

17
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.710
And we've kind of already gone through this process before when we were talking about authentication.

18
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.510
We spoke about how we can tie information with someone who's going to be making requests to our server

19
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.580
so to handle this whenever someone makes that request.

20
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.430
We're going to have some logic on our back end that figures out how to create a card how to add a product

21
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.350
to it all that kind of stuff.

22
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.520
That's kind of question too that we'll discuss.

23
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.740
But more importantly in order to associate this product in a cart with the person who just made the

24
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.380
request we're going to generate some kind of representation of a shopping cart and assign it a random

25
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.580
I.D..

26
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.170
So in this case when this person tried to submit that product right there we might create a shopping

27
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.380
cart for them with some random idea like 9 8 7 and then in order to associate that shopping cart with

28
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.520
the person who just made the request we're going to set that cart I.D. inside the cookie and send the

29
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.070
cookie or send the response back to the person who made the request because we are storing this cart

30
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.570
I.D. inside the cookie every single time that this person with this browser makes a follow up request

31
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.570
for application.

32
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.810
We're always going to know exactly what car is tied to that person because we're going to look in the

33
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.190
cookie we're going to see the cart I.D. inside their.

34
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.440
So again this is the same exact idea as all that request wrecked session stuff we went through.

35
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.560
Same idea as all that user I.D. stuff we went through in time the user I.D. to the users.

36
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.330
Cookie So same idea.

37
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.860
The only difference is that instead of having like a user record this time we're going to have some

38
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.050
kind of cart record or some representation of a cart and all the items that are inside of it tied to

39
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.910
that I.D..

40
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.410
So that kind of answers question number one how are we going to tie a cart with a person who's never

41
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.450
going to be logged in.

42
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.230
Remember you don't have to be like quote unquote logged in to store set and store information side of

43
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.910
a cookie.

44
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.250
The cookie is always there we can always store information side of it no matter what it is a hundred

45
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.290
percent managed by the browser and the information inside that cookie is always going to be sent to

46
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.190
our application on any follow up request.

47
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.650
So now that we've got an idea of how we're going to approach Problem 1 Let's take another quick pause

48
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.320
and talk about how we're going to approach problem to.
