1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,930
Now that we have that idea assigned to every record that we save we can start to implement some other

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,780
functions list inside of here such as get one which is going to retrieve a user or a record based upon

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,490
an idea that is provided we can do update and delete as well.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,390
Let's first take care of get one back inside my editor.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,950
I'll go down to the bottom of our class

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,510
and I'll define async get one.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,270
So when we call get one we're gonna pass them the I.D. of the record that we want to retrieve.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,520
Then inside of here there's not really any magic to this.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,380
We're going to essentially get all of our records out of the users not just on file.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,510
So that involves calling get all which we had defined up here.

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,100
We're then going to iterate through that different array of records and we're going to find the user

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,000
with the particular I.D. or then going to return it if it exists inside of get one.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,790
I'm going to first get my records with a wait.

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:03,110
This dot get all of then use the find array helper method.

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:11,520
So I'll do return records not find I'm going to iterate through each record and I want to return true

16
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,170
for the first record that we iterate through that has an I.D. property equal to the idea that was passed

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:16,650
in.

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,340
So I will say record dot I.D. equals I.D.

19
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,650
it's now to test this out.

20
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,120
We're going to have to make a little update to our test function down inside of this thing.

21
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,440
I'm going to delete the line where we are creating a new user.

22
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:43,350
I'm going to delete the line where we get all of our users and I'll say const user is a wait repo.

23
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,910
I get one and I have to pass in the I.D. to an actual user inside of my user store J's on file.

24
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,430
So at this point you need to open up your user stop Jason File.

25
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:59,710
You need to find one of the ideas listed inside of here and copy of that I.D. obviously you cannot use

26
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,600
the same idea as I am because you likely have users with very different ideas.

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:11,400
So I got a copy that I d go back over and I will call repo dot get one with that I.D. then inside the

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,320
console log I'll make sure that I console log out user instead of users because the is variable doesn't

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,220
exist anymore.

30
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,430
All right.

31
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:28,630
Quick safe back over run the file and I get a user back with the appropriate I.D. Now we should probably

32
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,700
also test this and see what happens if we can not find a user with a given I.D. So I got to just put

33
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,520
in an arbitrarily different I.D. to the thing whatever just some random string of characters save it

34
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,520
go back over and now we get undefined which indicates sorry but we were not able to find a user with

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,600
that given I.D. gets a definite looks good so another quick pause come back in just a moment and we'll

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,950
move on to our next method.
