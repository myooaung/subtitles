1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:01,560
All right.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,890
Now that we've got these better each cell structure we're going to go back over to our index not J.S.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:11,540
file and make sure that we show two separate auto completes one that's going to use left auto complete

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,440
as a route.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,650
The other is going to use right auto complete as a route.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,620
Back inside my index digest file at the very top.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,590
We are calling create auto complete we're passing in a reference to a div with the class of auto complete

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,360
which doesn't exist anymore.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,250
So I want to change that query selector to pound right.

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,050
DASH So let's do left versus left dash autocomplete.

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,780
I'll go ahead and save this.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,970
Now if we flip back over and refresh we see one auto complete on the left hand side.

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,650
So now we need to essentially do the exact same thing to create the auto complete on the right hand

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,180
side as well.

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,470
So you might be thinking that that means so we essentially have to duplicate all of this code right

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:57,250
here just to have a second call to create auto complete with a different route.

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,890
We don't have to we don't have to duplicate all of this config.

18
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,000
Let me show you what we're going to do at the very top of the file.

19
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:14,190
I'm going to create a new variable called auto complete config and I'll make it an object and we're

20
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,930
going to go into our current auto complete config so like this object right here and we're going to

21
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,350
take out every option inside of here.

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,580
So every key value property every function that is reusable between our two different auto completes

23
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:34,210
we want to show well if we look through here every single function inside is reusable except for the

24
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,640
roots element maybe that maybe will go down a line realize that it's not 100 percent reusable but for

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,210
right now I think that we definitely can't reuse just about everything except for that root element.

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:51,890
So I'm going to take render option I'll go down to the bottom of fetch data I'm going to highlight all

27
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,180
that I'm going to cut all of it.

28
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,940
It's now the only thing that's left is root I'm going gonna paste all of it inside of auto complete

29
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,350
config.

30
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:11,960
So now inside of the Create auto complete function call right here we're going to essentially say create

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,450
a new object take all of the properties inside of auto complete config that we defined at the top of

32
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,970
the file and then add in this new property of route and then take that whole object and pass it off

33
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,110
to create complete.

34
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:33,490
So to do so we're going to write out inside of here dot dot dot auto complete config and then a comma.

35
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,500
So the dot dot dot right there means make a copy of everything inside that object or essentially take

36
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,920
all the different functions inside there and throw them into this object and then add in this root property

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,900
as well and that's it.

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,820
So what we have right here is a hundred percent equivalent to what we had just before but now since

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,100
autocomplete config is its own separate object we can repeat this process as many times as we want and

40
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:03,060
create additional auto completes with the same configuration object so to do so I'm going to make a

41
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,470
copy of create autocomplete config or something create autocomplete just a function called paste it.

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,270
Now all we have to do is update the query selector.

43
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:18,890
So instead of saying LEFT TO SAY RIGHT IT AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

44
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,730
I'M GONNA SAVE THIS I'M GONNA GO BACK OVER refresh and now I see the two separate auto completes I'm

45
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,240
gonna make sure I don't have any errors nope nothing inside my console.

46
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,970
Now if I do a search for Avengers looks like the left hand side is working and if I do a search for

47
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,840
dark knight on the right yep that's working as well then click that Avengers click that yep looks good

48
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,360
now if I click on those I PROBABLY GONNA SEE AN ERROR down here because we deleted the element that

49
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,730
showed the actual summary your only call just a second go to update the H single file so I think that

50
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,680
the next obvious thing we have to do is make sure that once we search for something we need to hide

51
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,410
this kind of tutorial element right here and show a summary on just the appropriate side of the screen

52
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,780
let's take care of that process in the next video.
