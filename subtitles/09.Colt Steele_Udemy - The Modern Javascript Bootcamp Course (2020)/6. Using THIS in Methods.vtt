00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.500
Next up we'll see where this starts to become a lot more useful if we have an object like a Person object

2
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.280
where we have a first name.

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.670
How about share.

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.430
What is share his full name.

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:23.080
Well thanks to Wikipedia I have it Sherrilyn Sarkeesian so we'll make first name Sherrilyn will make

6
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:33.540
last Sarkeesian and let's also add in a nickname that student nickname camel case it which will be share.

7
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.290
All right so we have this object.

8
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:42.600
If I add a method to the object let's do something simple like Greece or how about full name.

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.850
Let's do a method called full name.

10
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.620
We can use the shorthand that we saw a couple videos ago or I could do it this way.

11
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.220
I'll do the shorthand though I think it's nicer and inside of this method let's council about log the

12
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.010
keyword this to start.

13
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.580
And now let's run it.

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.040
So person Dot.

15
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.770
Full name.

16
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.040
Execute it.

17
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.080
What do we get.

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.370
Okay.

19
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.300
So this time it is not council that logging the window.

20
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.170
It's concerned that logging something else.

21
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.540
Compare that to say hi.

22
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.790
Which is a function not in an object.

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.010
We got the window object the global execution context the global scope.

24
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.120
The window is what this is right here versus here.

25
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.860
The value of this is different.

26
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.900
The value of this is the object itself.

27
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.680
The person object right here.

28
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.470
So the value of this has been set to a different object not the window but the object that this method

29
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.310
is inside of.

30
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.270
Now why is this useful in the next video we'll see the head.

31
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.570
This is not always the case and depending on how you call full name it could reference that window.

32
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.420
But we're going to put that aside for now.

33
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.080
Let's talk about why this would be useful.

34
00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.700
Why do you care about the current object that you are inside of it allows us to reference these properties

35
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:10.080
or other methods so we can have a method that is aware of the other contents in its object.

36
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.680
So for full name if I wanted to print out first name and last name together I could reference this dot

37
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.630
first let's start there.

38
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.830
Refresh my page I'll call person up full name and we're getting Sherrilyn.

39
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.340
So this again is a reference to the object dot first.

40
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.500
Well give me this value so I can now update this to instead console dot log.

41
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.990
How about first.

42
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:47.620
So this dot first space and then afterwards this dot last.

43
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.930
And then if I wanted to use the nickname let's just start here.

44
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.670
Make sure it works.

45
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.780
Refresh my page.

46
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.790
Try again.

47
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:08.120
Sherrilyn Sarkeesian and then afterwards let's do a.k.a. this dot nickname tried again.

48
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.310
Now this is a good opportunity for us to use these structuring we're having to write this quite a bit.

49
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.320
I could add a separate line and d structure those properties from this first last nickname.

50
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.370
I have to camel case nickname equals this.

51
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.610
Now I can remove this from here and here it should still work.

52
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.860
Let's verify Oh did I not save area.

53
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.120
This needs to be uppercase one more time.

54
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.230
Now we get Cherilyn Sarkisian a.k.a. Cher.

55
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.480
And if I change one of those values in person.

56
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.020
Let's go with nickname person.

57
00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.320
Nickname equals Cher with a bunch of R's in all caps.

58
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.730
So now person has a new nickname.

59
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.750
If I call a full name again that changes reflected.

60
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.340
It's looking up the value of nickname on the current execution scope which is what this refers to.

61
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.560
And it's set to this object.

62
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.310
So now we have the ability to write an object or a method that is aware of the object it lives in which

63
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.240
means we can use objects not just to store different methods because they're related like we had add

64
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.370
and subtract and multiply and divide we group them together as a nice way of of just making a little

65
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.740
container for our methods that are similar.

66
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.680
But now we have a way of also interacting with properties with other values or even other methods.

67
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.920
So our object can now be a little self-contained world where we can have variables we can have these

68
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.190
properties.

69
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.540
This is a very simple example but I'll show you some other examples as we go on.

70
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.540
We have a little more to talk about with the keyword this in the next video but then we're just going

71
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.880
to see a bunch of examples of using this in methods and you'll be able to see hopefully why it is a

72
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.760
really really nice tool to have why you would want to do this.

73
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.470
So let me show you one more example here with the same object.

74
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.740
We could also add another method to the object and call a different method using this.

75
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.340
So we have full name.

76
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.140
Let's make let's make a method called bio print bio

77
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:35.500
and what I want it to do is get the full name from full name so we'll call this method and then print

78
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.690
something else we'll do like Sherrilyn Sarkeesian a.k.a. Cher is a person that will be the bio.

79
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.970
So I'm going to change this to return instead of console dot log.

80
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:54.340
So we now return that string and then instead of print bio I can call this dot full name.

81
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.690
I just have to use this if I just called Full Name It would not work.

82
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.850
We need this.

83
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:10.180
If I tried it I call print bio person dot print bio reference error full name is not defined.

84
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.780
So we have to use this to reference the object.

85
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:22.060
I'm going to save that to a variable we'll call it full name then I will console dot log from here just

86
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:28.180
put let's do a template string put full name in there and then is a person.

87
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.640
And that's the entire bio.

88
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.250
So we'll try running it again.

89
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:39.850
And now we get Sherrilyn Sarkeesian a.k.a. Cher is a person so we called a method that is located within

90
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:46.360
the same object using this in that method we actually accessed three different properties first last

91
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.050
nickname.

92
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:54.280
Using this using D structuring to make it cleaner but we're still referencing this the value of this

93
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.040
in both of these situations here.

94
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.870
Both methods is referring to the object that they live in.

95
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:00.730
And that's a great tool.

96
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.320
It's a great thing to be able to reference and you'll see a couple of examples as I mentioned as we

97
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.390
finish up this section.

98
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.430
But of course there's a bit of a twist here in the next video you'll see that sometimes this may not

99
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.140
refer to the object.

100
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.600
It could refer to something else.
