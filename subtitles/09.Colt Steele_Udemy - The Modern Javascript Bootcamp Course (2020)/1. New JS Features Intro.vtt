Hey welcome everyone.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.330
In this section we're doing things a little bit differently.

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.520
I'm calling it other useful things a javascript assortment hence the assorted bread on the right.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.260
As we've gone through this course so far I've been trying hard to integrate new features new javascript

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.000
features as organically as possible wherever they make sense.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.080
So we introduced a string template liberals really early on when we were talking about strings.

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.010
We talked about letting concepts which are new ways of creating variables.

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.530
We talked about them right when we introduced variables.

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.550
I introduced four of and four in along with the regular for loops and while loops.

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.910
Now we can't do that for every single feature in JavaScript as much as I would like to because some

11
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.160
of them are more advanced or they require a whole bunch of previous knowledge in order for them to be

12
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.030
useful.

13
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.550
So that's what this section is here for.

14
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.100
This section is going to cover this group of three new features and Javascript is really more than three

15
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.520
rest and spread or kind of separate things.

16
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.070
But these are not necessarily related except in the fact that they are new features in JavaScript so

17
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.210
I couldn't find it easy way to integrate them organically into another part of the course.

18
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.630
So they get lumped into this assortment section so we're gonna talk about rest and spread restructuring

19
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.810
and default function parameters.

20
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.490
We also have some other new features we haven't covered yet.

21
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.350
And those will get their own sections.

22
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.150
So we're going to return to objects then we'll talk more about classes and then later on we'll also

23
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.810
cover a synchronous javascript and async functions.

24
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.040
So this section as I mentioned is really focused on rest and spread.

25
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.690
Default function parameters and d structuring.

26
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.330
So that's what we're here for we're going to start with the second one default function parameters.
