00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,520
Let's move on to part two of our post request handler around dealing with carts so inside of here we

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,330
need to take a look at the cart that we have a treat.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,960
We're going to take a look at that items array.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,010
We're going to see if there is already an object inside there that has the same product I.D. as the

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,660
product that we're trying to add right now.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,890
If we find that same record or that same product I.D. then we're going to increment the quantity.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,860
Otherwise we're going to add a new product to the array itself so that we can use a very simple find.

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:41,390
Statement it's going to delete that council log and I'll say const existing item is cart dot items not

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,340
find.

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,980
So we're going to use the find helper to take a look at all the different items inside the items array.

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,460
So we're going to put in a function here we're going to iterate over each item and I want to return

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:57,870
true on the first item that has an I.D. to the wreck dot body dot product I.D. property.

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,490
Because remember when we submit our form we're going to get a wreck dot body dot product I.D. property

14
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:09,660
that is the idea the product that we're trying to add to our cart so I going to say keep on iterating

15
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:16,750
through until we find an item with an I.D. property equal to rec when it collapses just we can see a

16
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:23,980
whole line wreck dot body dot product I.D. l zoom out just we can see that entirely

17
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,390
okay.

18
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,380
Alex Good.

19
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,270
Now after that we're going to take a look and see if there is an existing item.

20
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:44,720
So we'll say if existing item then we need to increment quantity and say and save Curt otherwise we

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,620
need to add new product I.D. to items array.

22
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:56,730
So that's our two cases so we'll take care of the first case right your first so existing item just

23
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:04,020
be really clear is going to be an object that looks like this like that thing right there.

24
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,730
So it's gonna be an object that has the I.D. of the product that we've added and the current quantity.

25
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,680
So essentially going to take that object existing item and we're just going to increment the quantity

26
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,070
by 1.

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,330
So easy enough we'll say existing item not quantity plus plus

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,500
then after that we can handle the else case.

29
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,660
So this is the case in which we are adding in a brand new product.

30
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,210
So we want to take a look at that items array and we want to add in a new object that looks like that

31
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:36,940
right there.

32
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:45,000
It should have an I.D. equal to our product I.D. and a quantity by default starting off at 1 so in that

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,530
case I'll say carte items that push I'll put in an object with an I.D. of rec not body dot product I.D.

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,660
and a quantity of 1

35
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,890
and then after either case.

36
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,010
So either we update the existing item or we add in a new item altogether.

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,100
The last we have to do is save this record.

38
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:17,130
So we need to take this entire cart that we have and we need to persist it back into our repo now for

39
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:17,460
that.

40
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,040
Unfortunately things are going to be just a little bit challenging here.

41
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:25,870
So we're going to do something like a wait hearts repo that updates.

42
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,290
Remember this is the only method we have to make an update to an existing record.

43
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,560
So we're going to pass on the I.D. as the first argument and the second is going to be the very specific

44
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,790
update we want to make.

45
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,170
So essentially a new set of properties.

46
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,820
So the reason I say this is gonna be all a bit hard is that we're just going to make sure we pull out

47
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:49,320
the items array take whatever update we just made and save that as the updates so we'll end up with

48
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,350
something like cart dot I.D..

49
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,950
So that is the record that we want to update.

50
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,530
And then the update we want to make is to the items array and we want to save Harcourt items like so

51
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,330
because we've just made a change to cart out items inside this if statement.

52
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,470
Whoops sorry about that.

53
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,360
We made a change to cart the items inside this statement.

54
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,060
Either we updated quantity of an existing item which is an element inside that array or we change the

55
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,780
array altogether and added in a new item okay.

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,570
So this looks pretty good once again.

57
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,480
So let's save this and we'll do another quick test.

58
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,540
So I'll go back to my browser.

59
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,300
I'll go to my product listing.

60
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,690
I'll hit add to cart.

61
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,400
I see product added to cart.

62
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,360
Now the question is how do we test this or how do we actually make sure everything worked.

63
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,290
Well it's really simple.

64
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,480
Remember we've got the cart stopped Jace on file so we can just open up that file directly and take

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,850
a look at our cart and make sure that it has an appropriate item with the appropriate quantity on it.

66
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,220
So I will open up cart start Jason.

67
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,440
Here is my cart right here.

68
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,850
So I can see the idea of my cart which is again the FBI 1 E6 I can see that it has the items array there's

69
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,900
a single thing inside there right now.

70
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,820
So this represents the product with ideas 6 to be blah blah blah.

71
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,200
And currently I have quantity of 1 it's now to really test this thing out.

72
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,540
We can go and try to add some other products multiple times.

73
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,600
So I'm going to try to add the gloves a second time when I do so I should see that existing record right

74
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:17,920
here.

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,090
Whoops looks like I've got a typo somewhere.

76
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,360
So I have quantity instead of quantity.

77
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,320
So that's definitely a typo on my part.

78
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,430
Good thing we tested this really quickly.

79
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,860
I'm gonna go back over to my code.

80
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,610
There we go.

81
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:36,170
I said quantity plus plus it should be quantity plus plus it's going to say that really quickly I'm

82
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,490
going to delete that property right there that shouldn't be in there at all.

83
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:45,320
Say this again and I'm gonna try that out a second time so I'll hit add to cart for the gloves.

84
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:45,990
And there we go.

85
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,440
Now I've got a quantity of 2 I should also be able to add in a totally new item.

86
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,320
So for example this little hat thing right here if I click Add to item I should see a new record inside

87
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,170
this array.

88
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,950
So here's the idea of that hat and I get a quantity of 1 Okay.

89
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,880
So overall I would say that our cart adding logic is working out perfectly.

90
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,720
So this is looking pretty good.

91
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,300
Now the last thing we do while two last things we need to make sure that we can list out all the items

92
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,740
in the cart and we need to make sure that we can delete items in the cart as well.

93
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,860
So let's take care of that in just a moment.
