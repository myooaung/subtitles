00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.120
Last thing you have to do is to make sure that we remove the wall whenever we are travelling up down

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.600
left or right.

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.570
So I want to first get a quick reminder by taking a look at a diagram at how we're going to update horizontals

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.180
and verticals before I show you the diagram.

5
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.680
However or before we walk through it I just want to remind you that inside this function we have access

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.750
to a couple of different variables.

7
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.770
First we have access to the row and column.

8
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.710
That is the current row and column that we're working on.

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.550
We also have access to the next row and next column.

10
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.220
And that's where we are traveling to just keep specifically the row in column variables in your head

11
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.970
for right now.

12
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.260
We're going to use those quite heavily in this last block of code that we write right here.

13
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.560
OK.

14
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.700
So let's get to it.

15
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.530
So what I want to focus on is how we're going to update the horizontals and the verticals array.

16
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.910
We're going to first consider how we're going to update horizontals.

17
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.740
So we're going to imagine that we're at this center cell right here which means that our initial row

18
00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:05.180
is 1 and our initial column is 1 as well and then we're going to imagine that we move only left or right.

19
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:12.640
So only thinking about verticals right now as a reminder verticals are that that all these walls that

20
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.990
I'm circling right now the verticals and general

21
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.910
is always going to be.

22
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.280
Remember a two dimensional array it's always going to have three rows.

23
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.950
So row 1 2 and 3 years row one road to and three.

24
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.920
And then they all start off as false inside their

25
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.570
so this false right here corresponds to that element right there.

26
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.230
This false corresponds to that right there and so on.

27
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.740
So what we really want to determine when we are deciding to go either left or right right here from

28
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.500
the center element is whether we are flipping that to true or that to true.

29
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.820
That is the big question here and we need to decide which of these to flip based upon the direction

30
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.540
we are travelling and our current row and column.

31
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.610
So let's figure out how to take the current row and column and the direction and translate it into some

32
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.850
index that we can use to access the verticals array and update the appropriate elements.

33
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.220
OK.

34
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.590
So the actual row that we're going to update that's actually pretty easy.

35
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:31.090
The row that we're going to update inside the verticals array we put row right here is always going

36
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.370
to be whatever the current row is that we're looking at because we're always staying inside of the same

37
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.960
row so row is never going to change when we update verticals or whenever we move left or right.

38
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.630
However the same is not true of column.

39
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.770
So whenever we decide to move left or right the column index.

40
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.370
So we want to update is going to be either 0 or 1.

41
00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:00.150
So either that element or that element if we are moving to the left then we want to update the element

42
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.970
at column zero.

43
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.620
That would be that one right there.

44
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.800
So that's if we are going that way we want to dump this element right here.

45
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.120
So that means we need to access the verticals array at column 0 and update what is ever right there

46
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.800
to a true on the other hand if we are moving to the right and we want to update this thing right here

47
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.500
and flip it from true to false.

48
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.900
So that would be this element right here.

49
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.350
So we are going to the right that means that we want to return an index of 1.

50
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:40.710
We want to get index of 1 and update this guy so it's pretty clear here that when we are moving left

51
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.930
or right the row is always going to stay the same.

52
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.680
But depending upon whether we are going left or right we need to either access verticals at 0 or 1.

53
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.820
That's all I'm trying to establish here.

54
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.750
Now we understand that let's go back over to our editor and start to write out this logic.

55
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.910
So I've got my statement right here we want to remove a wall from either horizontals or verticals.

56
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.720
So we're gonna first think about moving left or right.

57
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.790
So we'll say if direction remember we've got the direction variable that we stuffing it into the neighbors

58
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:19.960
array if that is left then I want to access verticals at the exact same row that we're working on because

59
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.460
remember the row doesn't change at all.

60
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.770
It's only in the column that changes so if we go into the left we're going to look at columns minus

61
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.100
1 and it's minus 1 because remember we start off with a column of 1 that's the column that we're at

62
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.850
right now.

63
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.240
So we're gonna take one off to get zero and then if we are we're gonna set that to true which means

64
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.030
there is an opening here that we can handle the else.

65
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:53.730
If case otherwise if direction is right and we want to look at verticals again still on the same row.

66
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.280
But in this case at the same exact column we're gonna update that to true.

67
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.690
And I apologize.

68
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.640
I typed in the columns right here.

69
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.580
That should be column singular like so column.

70
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.860
In both cases and that's pretty much it.

71
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.710
So in both cases we got the same exact row were updating.

72
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.550
But if we're going left we're going to update at wrote column minus one.

73
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.690
Otherwise it for going right.

74
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.100
We're going to update at the current column to true.

75
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.500
All right.

76
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.730
Now it would really be nice to test this out so to test this out.

77
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.990
I'm going to go back up to where we established all of our neighbors and I'm going to comment out the

78
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.350
first three cases I'm going to say the only possibility here is that we can travel left and then going

79
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.250
to go back down and make sure that I'm still calling Step Three cell with a fixed value of one and one

80
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.210
and I'll save this go back over the browser refresh I'm gonna print out the verticals variable and now

81
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.910
I can see that I've correctly updated that element like this one right here.

82
00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.530
That one got updated to true that definitely worked out correctly and that was it for a move to the

83
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.690
left.

84
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:07.460
So now we can repeat that same process but I'll comment out everything but a movement to the right it's

85
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.170
now going to only be able to move to the right.

86
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.730
So I'll save this refresh printout verticals and now I see right there.

87
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.920
Awesome updated to true because I was moving to the right.

88
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.230
And once again that's because we wanted to update that one right there to true to represent an opening

89
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.740
in that wall right there okay.

90
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.370
So I think that we've got our verticals put together.

91
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.840
So let's take a quick pause right here.

92
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.470
We're then going to repeat the same exact process but with our horizontals instead it's a quick pause

93
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.760
and I'll see you in just a minute.
