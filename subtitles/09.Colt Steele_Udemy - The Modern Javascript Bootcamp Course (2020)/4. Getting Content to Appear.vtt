00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.660
Now that we have a better idea of some these different pieces of terminology let's start to write some

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.180
code rather than directly focusing on creating a maze like this right here which will end up being rather

3
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.120
complicated.

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.330
We're going to instead do a little demo first just to kind of get a handle on exactly what matter J.S.

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.200
is.

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.970
So we are going to re implement this demo that you see right here where we essentially have a bunch

7
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.760
of shapes all in a pile and we can drag one around and move them all when they all get kind of collisions

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.110
between each them.

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.270
So first build this then rebuild over to the maze type implementation.

10
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.470
So let's get to it.

11
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.120
I'm going to first go back over to my code editor and inside my index dot J.S. file I'm going to first

12
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.750
get started by requiring in or getting access to a couple of different objects out of the matter library.

13
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:47.920
So I gonna say concept.

14
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:58.360
And then gonna do some D structuring and I'm going to get access to engine render runner world and bodies

15
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.700
and that's all going to come from matter like so so when we included the matter script tag back inside

16
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.430
of index dot HCM L that added in a new global variable of matter and that is essentially the matter

17
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.310
j ust library so everything we're going to work with is contained inside that object in order to create

18
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.720
an engine render bla bla.

19
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.770
All this stuff we're going to pull out some of these different objects and then work with them inside

20
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.660
this file they'll notice that a lot of these terms right here are the same ones that we just discussed

21
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.120
in the last video.

22
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.770
So we're going to use the engine to essentially transition from a current state of our entire world

23
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.130
or all the shapes we have into some new states.

24
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.820
The render is going to be used to draw this stuff onto the screen.

25
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.130
The runner is going to coordinate updates between the engine and the world and then I had said on that

26
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.560
diagram body bodies is kind of a reference to the entire collection of all the different shapes we can

27
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.160
create.

28
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.120
Essentially the same thing we saw on the diagram.

29
00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:03.180
So bodies object represents our ability to create circles rectangle squares and so on then instead of

30
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.390
here we're gonna write out some boilerplate code.

31
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.470
Now once again it's not strictly necessary for you to 100 percent understand all the lines we're about

32
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.260
to write.

33
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.470
I just want you to have some terminology so you understand some of the boilerplate but at the end of

34
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.090
the day a lot of stuff that's just gets duplicated between all the different matter apps you might end

35
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:30.120
up creating the person we're going to do is create a new engine by saying engine dot create we're then

36
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.480
going to get access to a world that creek got created along with that engine.

37
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.950
So I'll say const world is coming from mentioned it's technically when we create an engine we get a

38
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.540
world object along with it.

39
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.300
And again a world is kind of like a snapshot of all the different shapes so we have after that will

40
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.370
then create our render object.

41
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.120
So this is what is going to actually show some content on the screen.

42
00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:03.000
I'll say const render is render dot create and we're gonna pass it in options object inside of here

43
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.830
we're going to tell the render where we want to show our representation of everything inside of our

44
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.400
e-mail documents.

45
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.410
So going to say element is document dot body.

46
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.750
So in other words go and render the representation the world inside of document dot body.

47
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.980
And this is a additive process.

48
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.470
In other words it's not going to destroy all the content that we already have inside of our body element.

49
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.470
It's going to instead add in a new additional element to the body element after that.

50
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:40.410
We're going to specify what engine to use and we'll pass in also an options object inside the options

51
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.860
object.

52
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.320
I'm going to specify the height and width of our canvas element that's going to be used to display all

53
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.410
this content.

54
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.390
So going to put in a width of 800 and a height of six hundred.

55
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.420
So these are pixel values right here.

56
00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.220
So we're saying give me something that is a hundred units wide and 600 elements tall.

57
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.470
Then after that we're going to tell our render element or our render object to start working and start

58
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.220
to draw all the updates of our world onto the screen.

59
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.740
It's all say render dot run I'll pass in lowercase render.

60
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:21.680
That the actual render object that we just created and then I'll call runner dot run with runner dot

61
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.660
create and engine.

62
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.560
So again the runner right here is what coordinates all these changes from state to state B of our engine

63
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.070
though it's just that we should build to save this and then go back over and see something appear on

64
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.400
the screen.

65
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.450
It's gonna go back over my browser I'll refresh and I see a big black box appear.

66
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.810
So this is where we're going to eventually see all of our shapes appear over time.

67
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.540
So now we can start to think about how we just add a very simple in plain shape to add a simple shape

68
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.580
to our world down here.

69
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.600
I'm going to say concept shape is bodies dot rectangle.

70
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.190
I'm going to pass on a couple of dimensions for this thing.

71
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.130
We'll talk about exactly what these dimensions represent in just a moment.

72
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.090
I can put in here two hundred two hundred fifty fifty.

73
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.870
And then an options object.

74
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.230
And inside that options object I'll say is static is true.

75
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:29.250
Like so then after that I'll call world dot add I'll pass in the world that we got just a little bit

76
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.730
ago when we created our engine right there and then as a second argument I'll pass in the shape that

77
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.970
I just created like so okay.

78
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.460
So we'll talk about what that code is doing in just a moment but first let's save this.

79
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.230
Go back over and we can see a shape up here inside of our element.

80
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.720
So that's the basics of getting something to show up on the screen.

81
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.190
But obviously we just wrote out a lot of code that's possibly really mysterious.

82
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.990
So let's talk about what's going on here.

83
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.240
After a very quick break.
