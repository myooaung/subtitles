1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,450
Next up we'll make it a little tiny game where we have a player a little sprite of a guy walking in

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,380
a coin.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,570
We're going to move the coin somewhere randomly on the screen and we'll use the arrow keys to make our

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,490
little avatar walk and pick up the coin at which point the coin will move somewhere else and you'll

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,380
keep moving towards the coin.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,880
I guess it's a commentary on the pursuit of wealth and never being fulfilled.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,330
And there's always a new coin to go chase.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:26,940
OK.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,470
So to do this we're going to take advantage of some of the key events we just learned.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,940
We're going to use the arrow keys to move our little avatar.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,780
And I've given you a starter code.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,960
There is a folder that you can download called cone games starter.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,300
It has the two images one for the player one for the coin and in the app yes.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,510
It also has a function that I've given you just so that we don't have to spend too much time trying

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,920
to write this logic it's logic that will detect if two elements on the DOM two divs or images or whatever

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,730
are overlapping and we'll use that to figure out when the avatar is actually touching the coin and then

17
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,530
we can move the coin.

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,520
So this is straight from I think I found it on stack overflow and adapted it a tiny bit.

19
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,520
It's just kind of annoying to type ourselves.

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,260
And it's also the kind of thing that if I had to do this I would just Google it anyway which is what

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,860
I did.

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,260
So I'll be transparent about that.

23
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,790
I didn't write this from scratch just modified it.

24
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,680
And what we're going to do to start is just make it so we can move our player.

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,340
And I'll tell you now that to make a game a real game that performs well you would want to use canvas

26
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,910
in the browser which we're not going to talk about at least right now.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,080
We're gonna just focus on the key events and we'll move the player by adjusting CSF properties top and

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,570
left.

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,020
So I'm going to start by selecting that image which has an idea of player.

30
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,880
So we'll do document that get.

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,370
We'll do query selector.

32
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,280
We could do get element by D2 we want just regular query selector.

33
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:11,800
The idea is called player cost player image or just player equals or how about Avatar.

34
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,050
And we also want to add an event for a key press or a key down or key up.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,810
But we don't want it to be on one of these elements.

36
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,890
We we want to be able to just press a key like the Left Arrow the up arrow anywhere and to do that we

37
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:34,330
can attach it to the window and key press is not going to do what we need it to do here in most browsers.

38
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,610
Arrow keys are not considered key presses.

39
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:45,010
So we'll do key down or key up let's do key up for now we'll add event listener for key up function

40
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,420
we'll use the event object.

41
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:56,380
And why don't we console that log event key we'll refresh the page I'll open up my console and I'm going

42
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,310
to hit the down arrow.

43
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,230
There we go right left up.

44
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,070
Cool.

45
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,830
So we have those four different arrows that we want to work with.

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,780
Those are the keys that we care about event dot key.

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,180
And let's just take one of them.

48
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,080
Let's start with down.

49
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:25,750
So when you press down we want to add to the image or the avatar style so Avatar dot style dot top and

50
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,130
I could just hardcoded right now to be like two hundred pixels.

51
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,080
The initial C.S. s has top at one hundred.

52
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,840
So if we set it to two hundred it will move downwards.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,560
And right now I'm doing this just whenever you press any key at all.

54
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,790
I'll refresh the page and I'll hit down or write.

55
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,060
And it does move down but only the first time every other time it's just being reset to two hundred

56
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,230
pixels.

57
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,740
So this is where it gets kind of annoying if you're not using canvas.

58
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:00,050
What we need to do is figure out the current value whether it's 200 or 100 or some other value.

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,840
But this is a string.

60
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,460
So we need to remove the pixels.

61
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,800
We want to turn that into an actual number like two hundred.

62
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:13,960
Then we want to add some amount let's say we're adding 50 pixels then we want to take 250 and turn it

63
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,670
into a string.

64
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:22,280
Then we want to take that and add p x and use that to update Avatar dot style dot top.

65
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:29,300
So what I'm going to do is probably make a separate function we'll call this concept extract.

66
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,880
Mm hmm.

67
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:37,110
What do we want to call it extract position and we'll pass in a string.

68
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,980
We'll call this pause and to use it.

69
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:51,290
We would do something like this extract pause of and then Avatar dot style dot top.

70
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,150
And that would be something like two hundred pixels.

71
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,570
And we want to get two hundred back from this function.

72
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,240
So we'll start by getting rid of the P X and we can use slice to do that.

73
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:12,490
If I have two hundred P X dot slice and I go from zero to negative 2 I'll get rid of those last two

74
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:18,640
characters even if my string is a lot longer we'll just remove the last two we're not actually removing

75
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,110
it but we're creating a new string.

76
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:28,960
So we'll do that here pause dot slice zero comma negative 2 and then we want to make sure that we turn

77
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,220
this into a number and to do that we can do pass int

78
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:44,090
and let's just copy this over here let's make a variable called pause equals three fifty P x and then

79
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:53,600
call pass it of that pause position we get three fifty if we set pause to be something larger p x and

80
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,730
run that again we get a number.

81
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:03,020
Okay so we want to return this and I think I'll just do an implicit return on a single line like that.

82
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:13,490
So now we have that function extract position and we'll save that to a variable const current top and

83
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:20,990
then we'll just take it current top we'll add in let's say 50 and then we want to add pixels the string

84
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:33,150
p x so what I'll do is set Avatar DOD style dot top to be current top of the string interpolation here

85
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:42,060
with a template literal current top plus 50 and then P x outside of those brackets and that should do

86
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,630
it for me.

87
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,540
Let's see now this is going to fire every time I press any key.

88
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:48,960
Mm hmm.

89
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,390
Does not seem to be working the way I'm expecting.

90
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,040
Let's take a look.

91
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,310
So we have our image.

92
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,910
Let's see what Avatar style dot top is.

93
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:03,240
Let's console that log Avatar dot style dot top every time I press the key

94
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,410
I'm not getting anything.

95
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:13,070
So is this returning Avatar dot style dot top.

96
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,440
OK.

97
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:20,190
So here's what's going on figured out our issue initially on our image the very first time it loads.

98
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:26,320
We don't have an inline top set so even though we have it set and see assess I actually went over this

99
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,440
in hopes of preventing these issues for you guys early on in the DOM sections and then I completely

100
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,660
forgot about it here.

101
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:40,120
So what's going on is that avatar that style about top initially is an empty string and when I'm trying

102
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,080
to extract a position from that we're getting not a number.

103
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,720
And then every time after that we're working with not a number which is not working well.

104
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:56,140
You might think that we could do this give a default value if position is not passed in or if it's empty

105
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,220
string or undefined set it to be 10 pixels will extract 10.

106
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,390
Or we could do zero pixels and turn that into just zero.

107
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:09,700
The problem is that if I tried out those default parameters don't run.

108
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,760
If I do extract position of an empty string it doesn't work.

109
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,600
If I passed in nothing while we're not returning anything.

110
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,040
So that's a problem.

111
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,600
But if I do return something

112
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,340
I would get zero.

113
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,000
But if I pass an empty string and we still get not a number.

114
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,440
So this default parameter won't work.

115
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,860
What we could probably just do.

116
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,100
It's kind of clunky.

117
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,330
It's not that bad.

118
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:43,120
Say if not position because an empty string is still false see even though it won't trigger a default

119
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,060
parameter value will simply return zero.

120
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:54,120
So if currently Avatar does style dot top is an empty string then we'll return zero and then use that.

121
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,360
OK.

122
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,910
So that should work better for us and then we're setting Avatar style dot top.

123
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,710
Using that let's make sure though double check and I'll refresh the page and it looks like it's working

124
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,940
on our time okay cool.

125
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,680
So now let's make it so it doesn't do this every single key that is ever pressed.

126
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:20,450
Let's make sure it's only if event the key is equal to erode down.

127
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,040
This is moving us down.

128
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,490
I did do some research and figured out that in Internet Explorer the arrow keys are actually just left

129
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,120
right up and down instead of arrow left arrow down.

130
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,430
So we could account for that as well.

131
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:44,240
We would just need to do if event Ducky equals arrow down or event at key or e dot key equals down then

132
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,320
we'll run this code where we're adding to the top.

133
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,220
So adding more pixels to the top moves us down.

134
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,000
Let's get the other direction going.

135
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:07,100
So else if event at key equals arrow up or e dot key equals up for Internet Explorer and edge we'll

136
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:13,640
do something similar and we can refactor this later we'll just do some very explicit long code.

137
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,720
We'll get the current top and then we'll set the avatar dot style dot top to just subtract 50 pixels

138
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,790
let's test it out refresh.

139
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,320
So I'm going to hit down I'll hit up I'll hit right.

140
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,010
Nothing happens.

141
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,310
Left.

142
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,030
Nothing happens.

143
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,890
So that's working pretty well.

144
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:37,260
There is one issue with the work around I added in for the very first time we pressed the key and when

145
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:44,400
it hit down we actually move up and that's happening because my initial style for the top is one hundred

146
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,670
pixels and then left is 10 pixels.

147
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:53,010
So I could either go to my app J.S. and change this instead of returning zero.

148
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,770
We could return one hundred.

149
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,570
So we're matching with the current top is.

150
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,560
And let's see if that works.

151
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,870
I'm gonna hit down.

152
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,310
There we go.

153
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,320
So we don't have that issue anymore.

154
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,300
Okay.

155
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,450
So we've got up and down.

156
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,750
Now how about left and right.

157
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,030
Well it's the same idea but we're gonna have to change it up just a tiny bit.

158
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:18,930
So let's duplicate our else if and let's do if the user hits the oh let's do the right arrow so right

159
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:26,850
arrow or if key equals right for those windows browsers or Microsoft browsers we don't want the top.

160
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:35,460
We'll get the current left and we want to extract that number from Avatar style dot left and then this

161
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,800
is gonna be annoying again.

162
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,550
We're returning one hundred one and I just say the original left is also one hundred.

163
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:51,420
So we're in sync and then we'll set Avatar dot style dot left equals current left plus fifty and then

164
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,900
one more we want an LC.

165
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,480
If we don't want an.

166
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,540
Else because we have a million other keys that could be triggering this.

167
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,450
We only want this group of four so else is not what we want.

168
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:09,830
This will be a left arrow and we'll check if it equals left and then we'll do current life.

169
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,040
That's the same.

170
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,320
We'll just subtract and we'll cross our fingers.

171
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,310
Let's see.

172
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,310
So I'm going to hit the right arrow in the left arrow.

173
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,140
It's not working.

174
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,840
So what's going on.

175
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,350
Event up key equals huh.

176
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,340
Well that was one of the dumber things I've ever done.

177
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,150
That's a complete lie.

178
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,970
I've done far dumber things but this was very silly.

179
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,650
Hopefully you've caught it before me.

180
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,430
Arrow down arrow up.

181
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,060
This needs to be arrow right.

182
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,340
Not right arrow.

183
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,360
And then same thing here we need arrow left.

184
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:43,740
All right.

185
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,470
Let's try again.

186
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,760
Hey I can move.

187
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,690
I can go down.

188
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,980
I can go up.

189
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,010
All right.

190
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:58,440
So one fun thing we can do is make it so that when we're moving to the left our image is facing to the

191
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,170
left.

192
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,820
And to do that I can just show you here if we do image that style.

193
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,160
Have it selected dot transform.

194
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,120
And we set scale to be negative one comma one up image is not defined.

195
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,500
That should have an avatar.

196
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,840
Try that again.

197
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,260
We're now facing left.

198
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,790
So we've scaled the image on the x axis.

199
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,630
If we pass negative one it basically flips the image and then to go back the other way we would just

200
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:29,260
go scale one comma one so we could just copy this.

201
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,560
And when you're moving to the right.

202
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,510
Well let's start with the left.

203
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,980
When you move to the left we'll set Avatar dot style dot transform to be scale of negative 1 come a

204
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,570
1.

205
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:44,100
And then when you move back to the right next time we'll go back to one comma one refresh.

206
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,240
I'll go down to the right and stay the same left.

207
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,930
We're now facing the correct direction.

208
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:56,130
So obviously this movement kind of sucks it's based off of having to press the key over and over and

209
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:56,840
over.

210
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,110
If I just hold one of the arrow keys it's not going to do it for me and that's OK.

211
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,680
This is not really how you would build a game for the most part.

212
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,150
I mean this could be a little demo but you would use canvas.

213
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,390
You would use some library to help you out with physics where you had coordinates.

214
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,300
So it's a lot easier.

215
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,380
But this is a good enough demo.

216
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,300
So why don't we figure out now how to move the coin to a random place on the page and then when you

217
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,430
touch that coin will move the coin again.

218
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,880
So to move the coin why don't we just make a function to do that.

219
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,070
We'll call it const move coin equals.

220
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,410
We don't need any arguments.

221
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,800
I guess we could pass in the thing we're trying to move but we'll just do move.

222
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,490
Coin will select the coin why have it selected.

223
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,490
No.

224
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:51,960
So const coin and I think I'm going to select this up top with our avatar equals document that query

225
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,850
selector with the idea of coin then down here.

226
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:04,250
We'll want to pick a random position to move that coin to and then move that going to it using top in

227
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,090
left.

228
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:12,420
So we'll pick some random numbers based off of window dot inner height which we saw sometime in this

229
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,530
course already a couple videos ago.

230
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,460
If I call window dot inner height or let's do it or with it tells me I have nine hundred twenty eight

231
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,980
pixels of will I shrink that down more and call it again.

232
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,510
Now it's one seventy five.

233
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:32,340
So we don't want to move the coin somewhere way off the screen if the window is not large enough because

234
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,720
you could have a large screen.

235
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,870
We don't want to do.

236
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,370
What is it body window that screen.

237
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,830
We don't want to use this because this is the available width for the window on my monitor It's 1920.

238
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,420
But I might only have one hundred something pixels available.

239
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:54,430
So we'll use those window dot enter height and I'll do a math at random.

240
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,620
We'll multiply it by window dot enter height and I'll floor that.

241
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:05,760
So we'll get a whole number and we'll save that to a variable called for doing height.

242
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:13,170
We'll call that y and then duplicate it make another variable called X math that random window dot enter

243
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,020
with.

244
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,930
So we have those two variables.

245
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:25,680
Now I want to take the coin and do coin dot style dot top equals and then I'll do a string where we

246
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,050
we don't even have to do a query string.

247
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,920
We could use concatenation and just plus sine pixels at the end.

248
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:38,520
But I'll do string template literal so for the top we want why this is based off of the height so height

249
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:49,140
p x and then for the left we'll do x p x and let's just try calling move coin from over here.

250
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,270
So move I mean make some more space here.

251
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,340
Move coin.

252
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,020
Let's see if it works and it appears to be working.

253
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:57,990
Okay.

254
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,120
So we're moving the coin around.

255
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,600
I'm sure you know it's not perfect our logic may end up moving it off the screen at some point but it's

256
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,530
simple enough for now.

257
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,360
So that moves the coin.

258
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,240
Now all that's left to do is to initially move the coin at the beginning when our code runs so we can

259
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:25,830
just put that somewhere maybe put our function definitions so we could just call that early on.

260
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:32,020
So we could just execute that and move coin at the beginning so that when you refresh the page the coin

261
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,110
is somewhere else and then we'll move to try and go get it and nothing's going to happen.

262
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:42,720
So the last thing to do is figure out when we've collided which I've thankfully given us a nice helper

263
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:51,030
function that computes that it's called is touching and all we do here inside of this event listener

264
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,480
after we've moved the the avatar.

265
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:02,550
If necessary we can just check if we want to check is touching that function that I gave you we'll pass

266
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,850
in the Avatar and that coin.

267
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,940
And if that's the case we'll just call move coin again.

268
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:17,820
So if this returns true we pass in two items it returns true if they are touching then we'll call move

269
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,720
coin.

270
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,320
Let's try it.

271
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,170
OK.

272
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,690
So so far it's touching has been called a couple of times but we're not actually touching it but there

273
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,500
we go.

274
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,100
It moved.

275
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,750
Let's try again.

276
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:38,120
And it appears to be working so very very entertaining game but it's kind of fun.

277
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,120
It's a little demo here and we get that fancy change of direction.

278
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:48,930
We're halfway to like a very basic basic game except we don't have anything fun.

279
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,380
All right.

280
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:55,590
So if you wanted to you could definitely refactor this a bit with the arrow down arrow up arrow right

281
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:01,800
arrow left you could consider making an object to hold the different functions to call you could make

282
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,880
a function called Move left move right move up move down.

283
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,240
That could be kind of fun.

284
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:15,720
So here's one option I'd make a couple of different functions called move up or we could even just call

285
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,220
this move vertical and then we'll take the thing.

286
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,910
So we'll call it element and then the amount

287
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,750
and what am I doing.

288
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,720
I want this to be an error function.

289
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,770
So we'll do that.

290
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:41,020
And we would call this for example here if we're trying to move down we would do move vertical pass

291
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,300
in our element that had moved.

292
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:51,880
Let's just go with Avatar and then positive 50 and then here to move up we could pass in negative 50

293
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,230
and we would basically move this logic in here.

294
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,610
So for move vertical we're going to do instead of Avatar.

295
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,260
We'll do element which is the parameter name.

296
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:08,930
So this could work for any element that we're passing it not just the avatar element style but top.

297
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:15,580
And then sets element that style dot top to be current top plus a mount

298
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,430
and the moment of truth.

299
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,610
Let's try deleting that.

300
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,400
Let's see if up and down still work.

301
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,610
It looks like they still work.

302
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,820
So let's do the same thing.

303
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:35,090
We'll make another function called Move horizontal and you could make one to handle all of this but

304
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,770
I think this will help keep them a little shorter and easier to understand if you're looking over the

305
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,570
code.

306
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:49,220
So here we want current left equals extract element that style the left element dot style dot left equals

307
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:59,780
curve left plus amounts and then we'll just call it if we're moving to the right we want to add 50 we'll

308
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,720
pass an avatar.

309
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:08,980
Make sure we're calling move horizontal and then the same thing for the left except we'll do minus 50

310
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,860
OK.

311
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,430
Let's try it.

312
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,820
It still works.

313
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,350
Except I deleted that one part where we flipped our avatar.

314
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:25,590
So I guess I'll undo that for a moment I get too eager there.

315
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,380
Do it like this.

316
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:34,730
So move horizontal Avatar negative 50 and then set the scale to negative one comma one here.

317
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,300
We'll set it back to one comma one.

318
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,230
Does it work now to the right to the left.

319
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,500
Down up.

320
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,780
Awesome.

321
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,420
And if we touch the coin find the pursuit of money.

322
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,120
Have to keep going.

323
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,460
Maybe more money.

324
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,190
Maybe I'll be happier now.

325
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,870
No.

326
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,850
How about over here.

327
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,230
I think this is the one if I just make a little bit more.

328
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,290
Get that treasure.

329
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,610
Oh man.

330
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:02,820
All right.

331
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,260
Next time awesome.

332
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,590
So if you want some extra features that you could add definitely one would be a score count or a scorekeeper.

333
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,690
Just a little chart up top or even just a paragraph in each one that tells you how many times you've

334
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,970
collected this.

335
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,900
Also you could create a whole bunch of coins different coins different values give them a different

336
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,030
color.

337
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,200
You could do that with a CSX filter.

338
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,820
You can make some of the coins larger to make them worth five.

339
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,390
You could also have the coins move if you wanted to get fancier but if you're gonna do a bunch of animations

340
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,130
I would look into canvas to make something a little bit more or a lot more performance.

341
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:38,460
All right.

342
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:43,110
So that was mainly just about the arrow keys but I thought it'd be fun to put something together where

343
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,610
we're using a lot of the stuff we've seen events we're talking about selecting.

344
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,540
We're talking about style properties creating elements.

345
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:51,820
All right.
