1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,460
The next logical operator we have is.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,540
Or so.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,470
Or uses the pipe character which is located above the return key at least on every keyboard I've used

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:18,210
you hold shift and for me it's on the backslash character so shift and then backslash gives you those

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,790
pipes so those are not once or not ls they're not slashes they are pipes.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:32,150
So you need to have them in a row and or is similar to and in that it takes two sides left and right

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,980
but it works differently if either side is true the entire thing is considered true so if we have true

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,800
or false.

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,610
Only one of them needs to be true for the whole thing to be true.

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,120
So if both of them are true that's fine.

11
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,200
It's not saying only one can be true it just needs one.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,580
At a minimum to be true the left or the right.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,520
And if that happens to be both of them if it's one of them it doesn't matter.

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,690
But in the event that neither side is true so we have false or false the entire thing is considered

15
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,650
false.

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,740
So again this is not how you would usually use it neither is this but this is slightly more complicated.

17
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,690
We're evaluating two expressions.

18
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,710
So is one equal or one not equal to one.

19
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,400
That would be false because one is equal to one.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,390
So we have false or 10 equals 10.

21
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:30,070
That's true false or true is true zero or undefined.

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,880
Now remember we talked about truthiness and falseness.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,970
Zero is considered falsely undefined is fallacy.

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,550
So we end up with false or false.

25
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,280
Neither side is true so the whole thing is false because the logical or.

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,750
Then we have the one in the middle 10 divided by two equals five.

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:54,720
That is true or no which is false falsely so true or false that evaluates to true.

28
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,740
So let's see an example where you would use this in practice.

29
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:05,030
Let's say we were running a community theater program and we're at the box office and recharging tickets

30
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:11,270
for people who are adults not children and we're defining children as people under the age of 6 and

31
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,720
senior citizens also get in for free.

32
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:20,450
So if you are one of those categories either under 6 years old or over 65 you get in for free.

33
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,000
Otherwise you don't you have to pay 10 dollars.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,240
We could use or so we would write something like this and close it down a bit let age equals let's go

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,000
with 78.

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:44,060
If age is greater then let's go with a less than one first if age is less than 6 or age is greater than

37
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,260
or equal to sixty five at least in the US I think Sixty five year olds are considered seniors.

38
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:58,000
Depends on the place we'll consider log you get in for free and then we'll have our else you must pay.

39
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,090
Okay so we have two things.

40
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,590
And if either one is true you get in for free.

41
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,870
If age is under 6 you're free if age is under 65 or greater than or equal to 65.

42
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,770
You also get it for free.

43
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,210
Let's see what we get.

44
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,530
You get it for free.

45
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,020
If we change it to three years old you also get it for free.

46
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,730
But if you're 30 you have to pay.

47
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:26,780
So if we were to rewrite this without using the logical operator it would be something like if age is

48
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,020
less than six you get it for free.

49
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,910
And then we could also have an else if age is greater than or equal to sixty five.

50
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,530
You get it for free.

51
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,290
Else you have to pay.

52
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:46,340
So when we use or we can combine multiple pieces into one line or one expression and again one side

53
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,300
is all that is required in order to pass go in order for the expression to be true in our code to run.

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,800
We can also chain multiple boards together just like we can with and let's do a quick example.

55
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,910
There are many many colors out there in the world but fans of mine or longtime students know the best

56
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,980
color of all time is without a doubt purple.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So let's write some code that checks to see if the color is purple or if it's a shade of purple like

58
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,050
orchid or violets.

59
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,640
We'll go with three to start.

60
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,720
So if it's one of those we'll consider that log.

61
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,680
Congrats you picked purple or something like that.

62
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,870
So we need a variable.

63
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,560
We'll go with light color equals something.

64
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:44,500
We'll fill it in if color is equal to purple or color is equal to lilac or color is equal to Violet

65
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,290
or some other color.

66
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,760
Then we'll come to that log.

67
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,620
Great choice.

68
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,050
We could keep changing these on and on and make a very long statement.

69
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,570
But as you can see here colors empty string we don't get anything.

70
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,690
Let's set it to Violet.

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,570
Great choice.

72
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,680
So only one of these has to be true.

73
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,150
And in our case violet color was equal to Violet.

74
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,530
Even though these were false this was true.

75
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,250
So we print.

76
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,210
Great choice.

77
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,300
You can chain them together although there is a much better way of checking one value.

78
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,390
Like if we had a color and we had 10 valid options we wanted to make sure it was one of those options.

79
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,130
You would not need to change this 10 times.

80
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,810
There are other tools you can use once we talk about arrays and some other built in methods that come

81
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,790
with javascript that would make your life easier.

82
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,620
But we're not there.

83
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,730
So we would write it like this.

84
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:38,950
We're still just focusing on or so we've seen and and or they are similar in that they take a left and

85
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,900
a right side.

86
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,890
We often use them in conditional statements inside the print but they're very different in how they

87
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,180
behave when we have.

88
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:52,240
And both sides must be true in order to move on when we have or just one needs to be true.
