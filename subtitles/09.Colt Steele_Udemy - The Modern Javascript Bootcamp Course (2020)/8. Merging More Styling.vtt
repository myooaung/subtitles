00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.110
We're now listing out all of our different products on the screen which is great but we need to work

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.860
on the styling just a little bit.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.410
So once again we're going to take some HDL and CSF that I put together at a time.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.540
And very quickly merge it into our project and once again this is just some HDL that I threw together

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.320
for us just to save us a little bit of time so attached to this video.

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.490
Make sure you get the zip file called something like AECOM 0 8 for template.

7
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.830
But then going to extract that and of here this time around we're going to see two JavaScript files

8
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.810
and a JPEG image as well.

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.490
So this JPEG image is just a little fun graphic that we're going to display on our home page.

10
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.830
It just has some information about a upcoming sale.

11
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.540
That's pretty much all it does.

12
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.020
There's no purpose to it beyond just a little bit of fun kind of styling kind of stuff.

13
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.070
OK.

14
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.330
So let's get started.

15
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.060
I got to go back over to my editor.

16
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.870
I'm going to find the view's products index not J.S. file.

17
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.600
So here's the stuff that we wrote just a moment ago and then going to open up the index dot J.S. file

18
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.180
by doing a quick drag and drop.

19
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.110
I mean it's like everything inside of here copy it go backwards.

20
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.110
The old version select everything and delete it and paste

21
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.580
Next up we're going to create a layout that is specifically intended for the user or customer facing

22
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.010
side of our product.

23
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.190
You'll notice that the stuff that we just pasted in already has a reference to a layout file that has

24
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.790
up one directory or in other words inside of our route views folder.

25
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.660
So this is going to be a new layout that is very different and very separate than the one that we put

26
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.970
together inside of our admin directory.

27
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:40.220
So inside of my views folder I'm gonna make a new file called layout not J.S. I'll then go back over

28
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.150
to the files we just downloaded do a drag and drop of layout dot J.S. we should see a doc type each

29
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.320
know inside of here and so on.

30
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.150
So copy all this go over to the new layout his file and paste OK.

31
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.920
Now finally last we need to take care of is that image.

32
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.710
If you open up the products index dot J.S. file which we just kind of messed around with a little bit

33
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.740
and then go on down to this layout section you'll notice that we are showing that image inside of a

34
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.380
directory at images banner dot JPEG.

35
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.540
So that means that our banner dot JPEG that image that we just downloaded there needs to be a images

36
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.890
directory inside of our public folder because remember that public folder is exposed to the outside

37
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.240
world.

38
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:33.500
So inside of that public directory I'm gonna make a new folder called images then open up that folder.

39
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:42.750
So here's images right here and I'm going to drag and drop banner dot JPEG over it's now inside my editor

40
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.400
I should see public and inside there there should be an images directory and inside there there should

41
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.020
be a banner dot JPEG OK.

42
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.460
So now we've got this stuff all set up.

43
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.240
Let's go back over to our browser and take a look at what it looks like.

44
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.780
So refresh.

45
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.970
Yeah.

46
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.300
There we go.

47
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.540
So we can see our big list of products right here.

48
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.630
As a reminder I run really far zoomed in so you should see something just little bit closer to this.

49
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.220
Now some of the elements inside of here really are just for fun.

50
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.600
For example up here there's like a phone number and an email there's some social media links on the

51
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.610
top right hand side.

52
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.520
Those links don't do anything and it's not really planned that we're gonna spend any time on that stuff

53
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.080
either.

54
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.210
They're just kind of simulate that hey this is kind of what an e-commerce shop looks like.

55
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.860
Well we can't see a list of all of our different products.

56
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.170
We can see if they have a add to cart button.

57
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.160
We got the title and the price for each one right now clicking on that button of course doesn't really

58
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.090
do anything.

59
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.080
It tries to make a post request but it doesn't have any back in functionality to it.

60
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.030
So again all we just did was include some H T mail and styling to get something looks like this or the

61
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.790
underlying logic in JavaScript side of things still identical to what we had a moment ago OK.

62
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.040
Now we've got this all put together the next kind of obvious thing we need to do is figure out that.

63
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.380
Add to Cart button.

64
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.850
So how are we going to somehow store the different items that a user wants to add to a cart.

65
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.800
How do we remember them.

66
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.130
And then eventually show them on that separate cart page that we eventually need to put together as

67
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.080
well.

68
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.080
Let's start to think about how we're going to approach that from the technical standpoint in just a

69
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.500
moment.
