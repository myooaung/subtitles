00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:01.590
All right.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.720
Let's make sure that when we press on the W, A, s and D keys on our keyboard, we apply some movement

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.000
or velocity to this ball right here.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.500
The first thing you have to do is figure out how we're going to detect whenever a user presses a key

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.190
on their keyboard.

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.250
Well, to be honest, there's not really a lot of magic to this.

7
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.310
We're going to set up an event listener on our documents.

8
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.280
That means whenever a user presses any key on their keyboard, anywhere on our application, we'll be

9
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.960
able to detect that key press.

10
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.930
So underneath my ball, I'm going to add in a document, not add event listener.

11
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.080
Are we going to listen for an event called Key Down?

12
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.150
As you can probably guess, the key down event is going to be triggered anytime the user presses down

13
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.110
on a key on the keyboard.

14
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.080
So then received that event objects.

15
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.720
I'm going to do a console log.

16
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.540
Of the event, because we're going to see something really interesting in there.

17
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.230
Really quickly.

18
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.500
It's going to save this.

19
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.140
Look back over refresh and then I'm going to click anywhere on the screen and see my actual application.

20
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.740
And then just press a key.

21
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.990
First, start off by pressing the key W.

22
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.040
If I then expand this event object, we're going to see a couple of different interesting properties.

23
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.210
So the one that is probably most relevant right there says Key.

24
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.940
So that tells us the key, though, is just pressed by the user.

25
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.880
There's also a key code property as well.

26
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.940
Traditionally, we use the key code property to decide exactly what character the user just typed on

27
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.650
as opposed to the key property.

28
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.740
Each different key on your keyboard has a different code.

29
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.780
So we can look up all these different codes to decide exactly what key was just pressed and then impart

30
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.840
some appropriate velocity on the ball in the appropriate direction.

31
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.380
So I can also do an A..

32
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.400
Whoops, I need to select the actual at first.

33
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.750
There's my A.

34
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.940
That gives me a key code of sixty five.

35
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.970
I can do a down person.

36
00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.230
S in this case, that represents the ball going down eighty three and then a D is a key code of 68.

37
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.420
Now we don't really have to just click and press these different keys all day and look up the key code

38
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.270
to figure out which key triggers, which key code we can.

39
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.360
Let's do a Google search.

40
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.820
We can look up JavaScript he code.

41
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.390
One of the first results here is key code dot info.

42
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.160
This is a really great little site to figure out exactly what the key codes are for each key press.

43
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.680
So if I do a W, they'll tell me, hey, that's eighty seven left.

44
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.160
Sixty five down.

45
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.820
Eighty three.

46
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.460
Right.

47
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.470
Is sixty eight.

48
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.280
So back inside of my editor, I'm gonna remove the console log.

49
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.890
And I'm going to instead set up a couple of statements, so I'll say if event up key code equals and

50
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.860
it was the first thing we should do.

51
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.480
Let's do up, which is a W..

52
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.380
So if a user has a key code of eighty seven, that means they want to go up.

53
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.780
The inside of here, I'll say console dialogue.

54
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.420
Move all up and then I can repeat that same process for the other keys, so I'll duplicate that instatement

55
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.730
down.

56
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.250
Once, twice, three times.

57
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.740
So that's up.

58
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.630
I'll make this one a move to the right, down and left.

59
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.450
Now we can just update the key codes for those appropriate directions.

60
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.130
So to move the ball, right.

61
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.280
I want to find my D key so that 68.

62
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.890
I'll update the eighty right there is 68 going down would be 83.

63
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.560
And going left would be 65.

64
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.660
So let's save this.

65
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.170
Go back over to my application or refresh, and I can once again click inside of my application frame

66
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.580
and then I'll go up.

67
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.240
Right down and left, and I can definitely see that I'm doing the appropriate console logs for each

68
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.400
of those different directions.

69
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.500
So this is definitely good.

70
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.820
Looks like we have a good start here.

71
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.260
So quick pause right here.

72
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.790
We'll come back the next video and we're going to figure out exactly how we can take these directions

73
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.270
and actually translate them to adding some movement to our ball right there.

74
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.660
So another quick pause.

75
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.910
I'll see you in just a minute.
