00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:00.870
All right.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.060
Time to start working on the animated border that is going to go around the timer at this point.

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.210
I really just showed you this circle and said oh yeah like the bill the order is going to fill up or

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.270
something like that.

5
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.120
That's not really a really good explanation.

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.990
So I'm going to show you the finished product of what we're trying to actually build here.

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.640
So here's what we're going for.

8
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.860
I want to show a full border around our timer and then whenever we click on that play button we're going

9
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.490
to essentially an empty thing out until it gets all the way down to zero like so that's the goal.

10
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.670
Well refresh and do it one more time.

11
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.870
Yeah.

12
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.730
There we go.

13
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.130
So that's we're trying to build.

14
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.580
Now I've got some good news and bad news for you.

15
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.030
The good news is that well we could definitely do this like that is within the realm of possibility

16
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.610
we can figure out how without any library or anything like that we can show that kind of animation.

17
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.680
The bad news there's always bad news.

18
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.550
The bad news is we can not make this kind of animation right here using just CSX orders alone.

19
00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.230
So if you're used to using orders with CSX in normal styling unfortunately we cannot use that to do

20
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.120
a animation like the one you just saw.

21
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.230
So to do the animation we're going to instead have to learn about a little side topic called SPG elements

22
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.460
SPG stands for scalable vector graphics.

23
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.960
This is going to be a set of HDL elements that we can use to draw kind of arbitrary shapes on the screen

24
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.250
in this video.

25
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.410
I can give you a quick demonstration of an SPG element and then we're going to take a look and understand

26
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.120
some the rules governing them and eventually understand how we're going to use an SPG to make that kind

27
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.100
of animation that we just saw.

28
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.940
OK so here we go.

29
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.670
We're going to flip over to our index dot each G.M. file SPG elements are each team l elements.

30
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.090
And so for this demonstration we're going to write out some each team l inside of your right above my

31
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.280
input element.

32
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:57.430
I'm going to add in an SPG at the height of two hundred and a width of 200 then inside there I'm going

33
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.050
to place a circle.

34
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.620
Now of course going to tell you what all this stuff is in just a moment but for right now just a quick

35
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:12.550
demonstration by CIRCLE element is going to have a property of our equals 20 C X equals 30 in C Y equals

36
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.020
30 okay.

37
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.080
So there's the HDL markup that we just added in.

38
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.160
Let's then save this.

39
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.290
We're gonna go back over to our browser refresh and then lo and behold we see a circle up here on the

40
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.100
screen.

41
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.500
So kind of humble beginnings here so to speak but this is essentially the technique or strategy that

42
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.470
we're going to use to get that fancy border to show up.

43
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.790
All right.

44
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.750
So now that we can plainly see that there's some kind of circle and we can draw kind of like arbitrary

45
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.560
shapes here.

46
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.330
Let's pause.

47
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.740
We'll come back in a moment and I'm going to give you a lot more details on how SB G's work.

48
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.270
Now we're going to eventually use them to do that animation.
