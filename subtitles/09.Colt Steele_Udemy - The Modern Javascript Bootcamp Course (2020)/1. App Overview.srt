1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,670
Well a new section.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,790
And that means a new application.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,540
So in this video we're going to start to discuss the next application we're going to work on.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,910
This is going to be a rather large app that's going to take many many videos to complete.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:17,090
So I'm really excited about it because we're going to walk through building a pretty full featured application.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,140
So let's discuss what we're going to be making.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,440
All right.

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,900
So we're going to making a sort of e-commerce application.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,390
We're going to be building a no J.S. web server that's going to serve up some HDL pages.

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,670
That's going to allow users to view items and shop add them to a cart and eventually attempt to purchase

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,010
them so when a user comes to our Web site that we're going to build we're going to show them a list

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,310
of different items that they can purchase for each item.

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,370
We'll show an image the title and the price the mockups right here.

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,930
Don't show the title or the price but they will eventually underneath each item will have a button that

15
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,370
says add to cart.

16
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,610
So if the user clicks that they're going to add that item to a shopping cart then eventually when a

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,310
user decides to checkout they can click on this cart link up here and go to a page where they will see

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,550
their shopping cart with all the different items that they have added.

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:16,140
So for each item we'll show a title a quantity a price total price for that line item and the user should

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,580
also have the ability to remove this item out of the shopping cart as well from the screen and at the

21
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,520
bottom will show the total for all the items in the cart and have a buy button right underneath it.

22
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,900
That by button isn't going to actually do anything.

23
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,700
So in theory if user clicked on buy we would start to accept some credit card payment or something.

24
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,640
We're not going to worry about billing or anything like that because that's really outside the scope

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,670
of what we're trying to do inside this project.

26
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:47,050
We are much more focused on how we use javascript to build a web server and show some dynamic H2 male

27
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,370
pages to these two pages right here.

28
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:56,450
The item list in the shopping cart is really all a public user of our application would be seeing.

29
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:02,350
So this is just the two pages that a customer would see and that's pretty much it but to really administer

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,540
and make this a reusable application we would probably want to make sure that someone who owns this

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,840
Web site or runs it on a day to day basis would also have the ability to add new items edit existing

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,210
ones or delete existing ones as well.

33
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:23,440
So in addition to these two public pages we're also going to be making a series of hidden pages that

34
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,320
we're going to refer to as the admin panel the admin panel is going to give an administrator or someone

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,010
who owns this Web site the ability to create products.

36
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:39,070
Take a look at all the existing ones edit the existing ones to change their image title and price or

37
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,480
delete them as well.

38
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:47,500
If a user decides to create a product or edit an existing one we'll show a form that looks like this

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,270
right here.

40
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:54,520
So it will have a text input for the product name the price and then a button to upload an image as

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,120
well that represents that particular item so this form right here will be displayed anytime a user wants

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,000
to create or edit an existing product we probably want to make sure that not everybody can come to this

43
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,940
admin panel again only an administrator or a site owner should be able to see these two pages.

44
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,580
So to make sure that is the case we're going to kind of lock down access to these two pages behind some

45
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,870
authentication.

46
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,900
In other words you must log into our Web site.

47
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:29,070
As an administrator in order to access the admin panel so that means that we're going to have to have

48
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:36,230
a sign up page for administrators where we'll take an email password and password confirmation and if

49
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,720
a user or an admin ever logs out we need to make sure they also have the ability to sign back in the

50
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,560
future as well.

51
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:49,890
And just be really clear this sign in and sign out stuff or see me sign up and sign in is only for access

52
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,070
to the admin panel.

53
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:58,680
So only administrators are required to log into the Web site a end user or like a customer can browse

54
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,570
all these different items and have a shopping cart without logging in at all.

55
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:09,180
So you really have two types of users users and administrators only administrators are going to be required

56
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,390
to log in public users are only going to see these two pages.

57
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,800
Administrators can see these two pages plus these administration pages as well where they can manage

58
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,770
the list of all the different products that are going to be created okay.

59
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,030
So that's pretty much it.

60
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,200
This might seem like kind of a small product you know at the end of the day it's only really six different

61
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,960
pages but to be honest there is a tremendous amount of work to do here because this is really the first

62
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,910
kind of web project we're going to be putting together or I should say the Web the first web project

63
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:45,090
that is based upon some outside web server that we're going to be authoring ourselves so let's take

64
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:45,880
a pause right here.

65
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,400
We're gonna come back the next video and we're gonna start to discuss some of the big ticket items some

66
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,100
of the big challenges we're going to run into.

67
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,390
And just in general how we're going to approach this project.

68
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,110
So I'll see you in just a minute.
