1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,770
Next we have to do is to make sure that whenever we click on a video inside of our autocomplete we should

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,060
hide this tutorial right here and start to show some summary information about that movie on the appropriate

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,540
side.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,430
Out of the left side or the right side so let's first take care of making sure that we just hide this

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,190
thing.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,180
To do so I'm gonna go back over I'm gonna go into my config object and I'm going to find where we have

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,280
the callback of on option select.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,430
Here it is right here.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,860
So I'm going to replace on option selector excuse me I'm going to add to the code inside of it.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,790
I'm going to get a selector for that kind of tutorial window that we just added in it's inside my H

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,380
and I'll file.

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,840
Here it is right here.

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:43,220
I'm gonna get a selector for a div with the class up tutorial and we're going to add a class to it that's

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:50,930
going to hide that thing on the screen so inside of on option select I'll do a document where he selector

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:01:02,640
with dots tutorial I'm going to look at its class list and I'm going to add in a class of is Dash hidden

16
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,720
like so this is another one of those classes that is coming from the bonus the SS framework.

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,680
So by just adding on that class that div that is continue the tutorial should be hidden on the screen.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,660
Let's do a safe and a quick test so flip back over refresh look for Avengers click.

19
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,280
And the thing is gone.

20
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,680
That was an easy one and a quick pause right here and we'll continue with showing the two tutorials

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,460
on both sides.

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,210
In just a moment.
