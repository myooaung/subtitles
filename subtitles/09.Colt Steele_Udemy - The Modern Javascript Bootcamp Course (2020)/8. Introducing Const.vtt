00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.870
Two videos ago I mentioned that light is one option for making a variable.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.490
There's also a another keyword called const.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.090
It stands for constant.

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.690
So it works the same way we use the keyword concept space and then a variable name equals a value.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.600
But there's one really essential difference which is that you can not change the value of const once

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.250
you set it once it's initialized with the value it is set it's constant.

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.200
So if we tried to do this concept age equals 17 that's fine.

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.740
But then if you try and add one to age you'll get an error.

9
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.670
It's not allowed.

10
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.290
You'll get in trouble.

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.970
So let's try it.

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:49.150
Let's do const year equals nineteen seventy three if I try and do year plus equals one type error assignment

13
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.280
to constant variable.

14
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.540
You cannot do that.

15
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.350
I can't change it at all.

16
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.890
I can't do.

17
00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.140
Plus plus I can't do year equals two thousand ten.

18
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.040
It is set and it's there for good.

19
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.880
So why would you use const.

20
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:12.490
Well here's a couple simple scenarios where you just need a label a name for always constant value something

21
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.990
that you'll use in your code.

22
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.990
For example Pi it's a constant you'll use it or you could use it if you were making some sort of app

23
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.610
with circles that were being drawn all the time you need to calculate parts at different things in the

24
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.210
circle.

25
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.210
You could use pi and give it a name instead of having your code riddled with three point 1 4 1 5 9.

26
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.710
Same thing days in a week.

27
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.200
Men height for ride instead of just a number that doesn't really make sense to look at you give it a

28
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.130
label.

29
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.600
And this also make sure that it doesn't change.

30
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.650
But that's not the only use for const.

31
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.820
In fact later on when we talk about arrays and objects you'll see that concept is more useful than you

32
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.520
might think when we get to those data structures more complicated types for values.

33
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.450
You'll see that it's a lot more useful and it's not just for making things that never change.

34
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.170
I won't get into it now but for now what we know is that it allows you to define a variable as is const

35
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.590
let allows you to change that variable whenever you want.

36
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.020
Const does not.

37
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.050
Also if we do to find a variable with const or let let's pick one.

38
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.510
Like people count equals 10.

39
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.840
If I want to define a variable using what I cannot use.

40
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.860
People count even though I'm using a different keyword left instead of const people count has been taken.

41
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.740
It's not available so you cannot have variables with the same name even though one is constant one is

42
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.040
let.
