00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.580
Are auto complete.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:03.290
Has a couple of things fixed up now.

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.820
So we get to now start to think about adding in some additional features to it.

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.220
The next thing we need to do is to make sure that once a user searches for something and then clicks

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.120
on an option right here we have to somehow handle that click.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.650
We spoke about what to do whenever a user clicks on an entry a little bit ago.

7
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.820
So remember we had said that we want to update the text inside the input so we want to update the text

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.280
from whatever the user had just typed like Avengers right here to the exact title of the movie that

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.540
the user clicked on.

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.670
So instead of saying Avengers it should say The Avengers inside of that input.

11
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.460
In addition we need to make sure that we also close the menu finally and this isn't really in this diagram

12
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.940
right here.

13
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.800
But the last we need to do as well is to make sure that whatever movie a user clicks on we need to essentially

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.570
render it out really large on the left hand side of the screen because that is the end goal of this

15
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.720
application.

16
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.660
But right now let's just make sure that whenever we search for something and click on it we update the

17
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.540
text and we close the dropdown.

18
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.480
So what we really need to do here is to detect a click on an individual option to do so.

19
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.820
I'm going to once again find my on input function inside of there.

20
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.830
We've got our form of loop where we create a bunch of different anchor elements.

21
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.330
We then add on some classes and set some enter each terminal and whatnot.

22
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.230
So to detect a click on one of those options.

23
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.900
We can add in a click event handler to that option variable.

24
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.930
Remember the option variable is an anchor element to add in a click event handler right underneath where

25
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.400
we set the inner T.M..

26
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.740
I'm going to do an option that add event listener and we're going to watch for a like event but a click

27
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.810
event.

28
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.160
Then inside of here we can do the two things we just discussed we want to update the value of the input

29
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.740
and we also want to make sure that we close the dropdown as well losing the dropdown to something we

30
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.250
spoke about several times now.

31
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.980
Remember you toggle whether or not the dropdown is open.

32
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.410
We add or remove the class is active to the dropdown element and the dropdown element is that one right

33
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.070
there.

34
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.780
Let's take care of that first.

35
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.280
Inside of my event listener I'll do a dropdown class list.

36
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.490
Remove is Dash active let's save that into a very quick test.

37
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.070
I'll refresh Avengers.

38
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.020
So now I'm going to click on the Avengers and the entire dropdown closes.

39
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.200
Very good.

40
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.190
So now the next two we need to do is to make sure that we update the text inside the input.

41
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.200
Once again remember that we've got a reference to that input on the input variable right there.

42
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.190
So we can update the value of that text input by going back down to our event listener and we'll say

43
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.750
input not value.

44
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.320
That's how we can change the value inside of an existing input.

45
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.430
And we're going to update it to the title of the movie that the user just clicked on.

46
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.560
We can get the title of the movie that the user just clicked on by using the closure scope of this function

47
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.130
right here.

48
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.840
Remember the closure scope is essentially everything outside of that era function.

49
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.670
So right outside that function we've still got a reference to the movie variable and that is the object

50
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.290
that has all the information about the movie that the user just clicked on.

51
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.530
So we could do movie that title and as I've mentioned many times remember title with a capital T because

52
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.610
this API property names are just a little bit strange they're going to take that title shove it into

53
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.530
input value and that should update the text on the screen inside the input.

54
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.730
Let's do another safe here flip back over refresh I'll search for Avengers and now if I click on any

55
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.790
of these right here I would expect to see the text inside the input update as well.

56
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.040
And there we go.

57
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.570
Very good.

58
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.750
Okay so this looks like we've got something pretty good put together now.

59
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.460
I would say that our autocomplete element is just about done so now the last thing we have to do is

60
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.080
think about how to take the movie that the user just clicked on and render out some details about it

61
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.020
on the screen just like we said we would do with the original mockups of this application.

62
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.030
So like this right here we want to show the image title some statistics and so on.

63
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.910
So another quick pause and we'll start to address that in the next video.
