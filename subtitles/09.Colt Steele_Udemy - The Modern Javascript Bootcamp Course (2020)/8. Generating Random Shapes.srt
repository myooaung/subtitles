1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,090
Last thing I want to do to replicate that little demo we were looking at over here is to just make sure

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:10,070
that we can show a bunch of different shapes at the same time and there's not really any magic to this.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,630
And that's why I want to show you how to do it.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,180
And a little demo when I see it.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,210
There's no magic to it.

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,580
I mean essentially we're gonna do the same thing as what we did before.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,790
We're just gonna create a bunch of different rectangles and add them into the world.

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,380
That's it I'm going to find where we're creating that one single lone rectangle by itself right now.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,740
I'm gonna get a little comment right above it that says something like random shapes.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,390
Again just to remind myself of what this code right here is about to do.

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,480
Then I'll set up a for loop around that statement.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:48,960
They'll say for let I starting at zero I less than 20 plus plus and I'll throw that in there like so

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,930
it's let's save this.

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,310
This should create 20 rectangles all on the exact same spot with the same size.

15
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,140
So if I go back over and refresh we're gonna see very quickly that they kind of like spread out.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,430
That's because matter J US wants to allow all these shapes to just contact each other on the edges.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,780
When we create a bunch different shapes on the exact same point matter J S freaks out and tries to distribute

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,680
those all around the screen and that's what we end up seeing them all kind of stack up like so.

19
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,740
So a slightly better way to handle this would be to slightly randomize the starting positions of two

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,120
hundred and two hundred in order to randomize those starting positions.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:35,500
We can multiply the starting position by the width and the height of the canvas overall and that should

22
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,840
give us some even distribution all around the screen to make sure that I multiply by the width and height

23
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,860
correctly.

24
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,930
I'm going to define the within the height up here at the top as constants.

25
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,870
They'll say width is a hundred and height is six hundred.

26
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,470
So now we're down here at options.

27
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:00,020
I can replace the numbers with just within height because the keys and the values are the same.

28
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:07,680
I can leave it just like that and those will be expanded to width is width and height is height you

29
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,760
might be curious why we're pulling out these separate variables right here.

30
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,040
Well it's because I essentially want to refer to the White height and width.

31
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:20,120
Later on down the file if we start to reproduce numbers like six hundred and eight hundred down here

32
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,820
on this line of code it might be hard later on to figure out exactly why we are using the numbers eight

33
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,800
hundred and six hundred and so by defining a constant.

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,600
At the very top that means that if we ever want to change these values we can change them in one location.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,170
Now we'll make updates all throughout the file.

36
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,350
This is a technique that we're going to use quite a bit when we start working on a maze version of this

37
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,600
app.

38
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:47,820
In just a moment now we can use those two variables to do some random placement so for the position

39
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:57,490
on the x axis I'm going to say math at random times with and then for the position on the y axis we'll

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,890
do math at random times.

41
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,670
Right.

42
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:09,350
And I'll save just to get that all down to multi line like so okay so let's see now give us some random

43
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,850
distribution about the entire canvas.

44
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,760
Let's now save this.

45
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,360
Go back over refresh and there we go.

46
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,110
That's all a bit closer to the demo we saw over here where they all get kind of randomized.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,480
Right now the last thing that we need to do is to just try to create some different kinds of shapes

48
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,480
instead of just squares.

49
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,890
So for that inside of our for loop we can add in a little if statement I'm going to create a random

50
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,380
number.

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,770
So again math not random.

52
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,360
Remember when we called Math dot random that's going to create a number between 0 and 1.

53
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:47,040
I'm gonna check to see if that is greater than zero point five if it's greater than zero point five.

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,780
Then I'm going to go ahead and create a rectangle otherwise I'm gonna create a different shape altogether

55
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,260
so if we don't create a rectangle and we have a value less than zero point five I'm going to instead

56
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,250
try to create a circle.

57
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,590
So I'll do another world.

58
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,820
Add I'm going to add a shape to the world.

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,740
And then as the second argument I'll put in bodies dot Circle the Circle method right here is very similar

60
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,520
nature to rectangle.

61
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,620
The first two arguments are going to be numbers that represent where we want to put the circle in the

62
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,980
world and we have to put in those two values as x y coordinates so we can use the same trick we used

63
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,700
right above.

64
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:39,290
So I'll say asked random times with and math at random times height then the third argument is a little

65
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,510
bit different.

66
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,020
The third argument is going to be the radius of the circle.

67
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,970
In this case I'll do about a slightly larger circle than the rectangles we're adding right now so I'll

68
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,060
do a radius of.

69
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,950
Well actually technically if you like about 35 or so that's the radius.

70
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,360
So the entire diameter or like the full width of the circle will be seventy five which will be just

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,310
a little bit larger than the rectangles we're adding in it so I'll save this as well refresh.

72
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,190
And there we go.

73
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,130
Now if we want to we can adjust the number of shapes we're adding in.

74
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,460
So instead of the 20 right there we could do like say 50.

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,530
Just make sure that you don't add in too many shapes because otherwise your browser is going to lock

76
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:24,640
up due to the processing power from trying to figure out what to do with all these shapes.

77
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,190
So I'd say that's pretty close to the demo we just saw.

78
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,690
Now you will notice that these the demo over here has those little lines.

79
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,140
The lines are meant to indicate the orientation of each shape.

80
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,850
We can easily add those in by just adding in another option or two we will worry about that just yet

81
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,530
but there is one other option.

82
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,150
I thought you might be curious about.

83
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,950
Right now we are operating the entire canvas in what is called wireframe mode in wireframe mode.

84
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:54,220
That means we just see the outline of each shape but if we want to we can go back up to where we create

85
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,570
our render.

86
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:03,340
Here it is right here into the options object we can put in wireframe is false so that means tried to

87
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:09,700
render a solid shape as opposed to just the outline and we do a wireframe a false who sees me I think

88
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,220
it's capital F..

89
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,270
Let's try that.

90
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,460
No I'm totally wrong wire frames.

91
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,610
That's what it is.

92
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,130
So I was going off of memory here lowercase f. pl. S..

93
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,250
That's better.

94
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:21,520
Okay.

95
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,680
So when you set wire frames to false.

96
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,190
We're gonna get solid shapes and the colors for them will be picked at random.

97
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,980
There we go.

98
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:36,070
Now you can even see that the bordering shapes or the bordering rectangles are solid as well firstly

99
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,330
I like the wireframe just a little bit more but when we eventually put the maze together I think you're

100
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,530
going to find that showing the maze with some solid shapes instead of wire frames just makes the maze

101
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,540
look a little bit more interesting lasting one dimension is that we can customize the color that is

102
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,670
being used if we go to where each shape is being created.

103
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,290
So let's say that for each circle maybe we want them all to be the color red.

104
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,570
We can find where we create the circle so that's the bodies start circle right here and then as the

105
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:11,870
last argument we can put in an options object and inside there we can add in a little render property.

106
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:17,340
So this is going to customize how this circle gets rendered onto the screen so inside of this new render

107
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:24,910
object we can add in Bill style and that can be any valid SS color so it can be like a normal color

108
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,530
like red.

109
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,350
It can be a hex value and so on.

110
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:35,930
I'll try out red really quickly so I'll save now all the circles are red where I can do say green and

111
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,820
now I've got a bunch of green circles.

112
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,180
All right.

113
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,540
So that's pretty much it for the demo.

114
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:46,540
We've seen basically believe it or not just about everything that you need to see to build out the maze.

115
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,860
There's only one or two additional topics that we need to be aware of when it comes to matter J.S. that

116
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,660
is to actually build the maze out and that's really just understanding how to control a single shape

117
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,150
using the keyboard instead of the mouse.

118
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,160
So we'll figure that out.

119
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,420
Honestly that's not the worst thing in the world at all.

120
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,390
It's actually rather easy to add in the keyboard controls.

121
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,230
So most of the stuff around the maze that we're going to be doing is just discussing the algorithm we're

122
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,140
going to use to calculate the shape of the maze.

123
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,410
All right.

124
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,530
Let's take a pause right here.

125
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,490
We'll come back the next video and start working on our maze code.
