1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,990
Next up we have another property that is kind of similar to enter text and text content.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:11,790
It's called inter HMO but it has a different name obviously and it has different purpose so inter HMO

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:19,620
is going to return or retrieve not only the text instead of an element but also all other tags inside

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,730
of a given element.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,370
So if I were to call form if I select this form dot enter HMO I would get all of these elements.

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,490
If I were to do form dot in our text there is no in our text here.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,900
So let's try to select the form.

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,270
I'll do a query selector document dot query selector of form.

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,540
There's only one form I'll get the first one I'll save it to a variable called form and then form dots

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,910
inner HMO.

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,800
All caps on it on the HMO portion see what I get here.

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,160
I'm getting a string that contains all of the elements inside.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,650
So I get everything between those two tags.

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,440
It could be text.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,870
It could be other tags.

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,250
It all just gets grouped in inter HMO.

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,450
If I were to try it on one more thing let's select the first.

18
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,230
Well we find I'll do.

19
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,140
Document the query selector.

20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,780
You will save that to a variable.

21
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,960
Just give it the name of.

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,980
Well not very creative.

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,500
Do you well that inner text.

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,630
We saw this in the last video we get first thing second thing third thing and that's because that's

25
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,660
the entire text.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,970
It's skipping the actual text.

27
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:35,490
Now if I do you well that inner HMO I get all of the content in there the ally and the text the ally

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,310
the text ally and the text all the attributes are there everything that I wrote in the HMO is showing

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:49,560
up and I can use inter HMO to update the insides of an element the the insides to change the content

30
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,150
in between the two tags.

31
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:59,160
If I wanted to sew for the form which is right here I could do this form dot enter HMO equals and then

32
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:07,640
just pass in some text if I wanted to and that entire form now only contains this text if I go to the

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,910
elements tab and I look at the form that's it everything that was there before is gone I kind of destroyed

34
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,530
it which is usually not what you want to do but sometimes maybe it is.

35
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:25,220
And if we were just sitting text then I would probably use enter text but we can also add HMO elements

36
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:31,970
in the annoying part is that we have to make them a string enter text enter HMO text content they all

37
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,300
return Strings so no objects are involved here except for the object that we're actually selecting.

38
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:45,410
I have my form that's an object of course but if I do inner city email again and I want to set it to

39
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:51,760
contain some other element I can pass in a string and write each team out in there.

40
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,900
So this is fine for simple elements but if you're doing something more complex it can be kind of annoying

41
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,990
to type it all as a giant string and we'll see another way of adding elements later on in the same section.

42
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:08,340
But just to show that it works let's do enter each team our equals what could we add inside the form.

43
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,570
How about a bold tag.

44
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:17,000
I am a bold tag close it correctly will hit enter.

45
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:24,060
Now we have a bold tag in there so enraged him allows us to pass in a string containing text containing

46
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,670
each came out elements and what it will do is actually pass this string and look for those text it's

47
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,240
it's going through it and figuring out OK what is an element here what is just text and then it reflects

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,970
those changes in the DOM.

49
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,550
And now if we look at form this is getting a bit ahead of ourselves but if we do a console that desire

50
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:52,410
of form and if we look at its children it has a new object as a child it has a bee object.

51
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,720
It's an element so it's not just about setting the text and the browser just inserting that in between

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,990
the the tags.

53
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:06,690
It's actually reading this and creating a bold object a bold tag object and that's what we see here.

54
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,580
So it does take more time because of that compared to enter text.

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,760
If you're just setting text but if you need to add elements you can do it this way.

56
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,170
But as I mentioned it gets obnoxious especially if you have attributes with quotation marks and you've

57
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,380
got to mix and match your quotes now with template literal strings.

58
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,530
It's not too bad but still there are other ways of adding elements we're just not there yet.

59
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:36,400
Now the last thing about inter HMO versus inter text let's select the H1 so document dot query selector.

60
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,980
I'm just going to stick to query selector for most of this because it's our Swiss Army knife.

61
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,640
It's so versatile.

62
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,020
We'll save it to a variable called H1.

63
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,660
I now have H1.

64
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,990
We'll look at Inter text.

65
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,960
We'll look at Inter HMO.

66
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,150
Great.

67
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,760
If I wanted to add something in to my Web page the first thing I'll show you that we haven't seen you

68
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,570
can do this.

69
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,020
You can do.

70
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,100
Plus equals.

71
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,960
If you don't want to completely override what's there you want to keep my web page.

72
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,370
And for some reason I also want to add is cool.

73
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,800
I'll put a space there because this string will just be added into what is already there.

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,700
And now we have my web page is cool.

75
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,370
Probably not that often that you would do it but you can.

76
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,840
But what I want to show you here is that there is a difference between inter HMO and inter text when

77
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,140
you are setting them.

78
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,040
When we retrieve them we've already seen the difference in our text does not give you the tags enter

79
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,130
each time Al does.

80
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,060
When you set them it seems like you could use either if I want to add an element into this each time

81
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,510
I'll tag it into his h1 tag let's say I want to.

82
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,060
I don't know.

83
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,210
Plus equals a bold tag with a bunch of exclamation points.

84
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:55,090
I could do H1 but enter each Timo plus equals and then I'll write my bold tag and then some exclamation

85
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:03,720
points like that close my quote and those are I guess it's kind of hard to tell what those are bolded

86
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,870
they're part of a heading but we can trust that they're bolded if we take a look at the H1 they are

87
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,790
inside of a bolt tag.

88
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:18,320
Now if I instead do this with inner text I'll just add more exclamation points.

89
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,940
Sure.

90
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,880
What do you think is going to happen.

91
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,590
That's what happens so it doesn't ignore the tags.

92
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,550
It just doesn't treat them as actual elements or tags for each team.

93
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,370
It doesn't pass them it doesn't understand that they are bold tags.

94
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,430
Instead it just takes this entire string and puts it in the element.

95
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,190
So we end up with the string of a bold tag.

96
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,170
So if you are trying to update HMO you're trying to add an element with inner HMO.

97
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,200
You need to use our HMO with Inter text.

98
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,230
You can't actually create new elements.

99
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,900
You can't tell the browser I want to insert a bold tag or an image.

100
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,000
It will just insert the text that you pass in the literal string.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,300
All right.

102
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,010
So that's inner HMO.

103
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,890
Like I said there are other ways of creating elements.

104
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:12,100
So maybe not all that common they used once you see the other options but it's important to cover already.
