1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,690
So that's the basics of adding a method to a object.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,300
It's just a key value pair.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,180
The function is the value.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,090
Now we didn't show this.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,100
You can use an arrow function.

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,280
It's not that common for reasons you'll see in just a moment.

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,050
Once we talk about the keyword this but in addition there is a nice new shorthand for adding a method

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,540
to an object where we don't have to use the key value pair syntax where we have a key colon and then

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,410
a function.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,620
Instead we can write a function like this.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,000
So we give it a name and this name will be used to create the key.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,510
We still need our commas to separate the properties but now we don't have to do the key colon value.

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,900
So this is a newer syntax if we want to try it out we'll make an object here called off and we'll have

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:54,720
some dummy functions like log in and log in will simply console that log logged you in like that.

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:55,720
All right.

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:01,480
So nothing very extravagant but we have a function in here and it's actually a method.

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,750
If we look at auth this is what it turned into.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,020
We have log in as the key and then a function that corresponds to it as the value.

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,370
So it uses this to create the key.

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,430
And again we do need commas if we have more than one property in here.

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,610
So instead of auth if I wanted to add user name is Tommy boy Tommy bot.

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,370
Sure.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,500
We need a comma and it still works.

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,610
We now have two properties to add another method in.

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,490
Same thing.

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,670
I need my comma here and then we can go with logout and we'll cancel that log.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,770
Goodbye.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,860
Now we'll take a look at.

29
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,720
Off one more time and we have three properties.

30
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,090
If we leave that comma out it's not happy with us it doesn't know what to do.

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,390
We are in an object even if we're using this nice shorthand we still need to separate all properties

32
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,060
by commas and that's kind of it.

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,980
It's a nice shorthand it is new.

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:04,860
So it's not something that you may see all the time in older tutorials but it's here for a reason we

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,930
do this so often we add properties to an object.

36
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,370
This is just cleaner.

37
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,540
We don't have to write this log in key.

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,640
Colon and then a function expression.

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,600
We don't have to clutter our code with the function keyword or if we use an arrow function.

40
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,410
We still would be cluttering this just show you that we can do an arrow function.

41
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:32,190
We still are cluttering our code here with the log in key that colon is just additional here.

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,230
It's a lot shorter okay.

43
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,460
And that's it.

44
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,660
Next we've got a big one.

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,480
We're going to talk about the keyword this really fundamental thing in javascript that helps us write

46
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,990
much more useful methods in our objects.
