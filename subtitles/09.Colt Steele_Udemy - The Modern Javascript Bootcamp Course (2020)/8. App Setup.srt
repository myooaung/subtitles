00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,850
In this video we're going to set up a project that we wrote earlier on INSIDE the course and get it

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,870
ready for doing a little bit of testing.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,160
So attached to this video you're going to find a zip file called testing 0 0 8 app.

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,720
Make sure you download that file.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,470
The project inside of here they were going to run some tests for is the movie comparison application

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,490
that we worked on a little bit ago.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,790
Now if you skipped over that app don't sweat it.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,040
I'll show you exactly how this thing works.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,690
If you already wrote the app and you saw the source code from it I still recommend you grab the zip

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,600
file attached to this video just so you know that you're using exactly the same code as I so once you

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,900
grab that file and extract it we're gonna take that folder.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,490
We're going to open it up inside of our code editor.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,550
Now just really quickly I'm going to take that folder and drag it into my little workspace directory

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,180
right here.

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,730
That's totally optional at the end of the day.

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,560
All you really have to do is open up that file inside of your Ed it's going to change over to that new

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:54,910
folder

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,650
and I'll open up my code editor inside.

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,210
And then finally I'm going to go over to my browser.

20
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:12,110
I'm going to open up a new tab and I'm going to drag and drop the index dot HDL file from that folder

21
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,930
we just downloaded and open it up inside my browser.

22
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,210
So this is what we should see.

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,810
So make sure you see something like this right away.

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,590
I want you to type in this little search input.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,840
Try putting in something like a come new movie title.

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,330
I'm gonna put in Avengers like so and very shortly after I do that I should see some output like this

27
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,320
appear.

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,970
If you don't see any output like this it means that there is a little error with the API key that I

29
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,130
included inside this project.

30
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:46,100
This project is using an outside API to get the list of movies to display on the screen that API key

31
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,640
that is included has a daily cap on the number of requests that can be issued.

32
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,520
So if you try to make that request and you don't see anything occur you can open up your console refresh

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,320
the page try to search for that movie title again and if you see an error right here that says something

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,490
specifically like a 400 error or a 4 or 1 or 4 or 3.

35
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,680
That means that there is likely something wrong with the API key that is told OK I will show you how

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,160
to generate your own API key to use inside this project.

37
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,640
Let's first take a very quick pause we'll come back the next video in the next video.

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,360
I'm going to show you how to generate that API key if you need one.

39
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,760
And we'll also do a very quick overview on how this application works.
