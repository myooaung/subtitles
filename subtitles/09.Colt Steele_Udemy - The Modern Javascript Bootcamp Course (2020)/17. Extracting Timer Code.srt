1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,390
Well our timer is all done for right now.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,230
I said at the end of the last video that we're gonna start working on the border.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,270
There actually is one last very quick thing I want to do right now.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,160
Our next stop jazz file has a lot of different code inside of it so it has our timer implementation

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,230
at the top then had some queries selectors and then where we actually create the timer as well just

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,960
to clean up our project a little bit.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,820
I would like to extract the class definition for the timer into a separate file just so that our index

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,210
not just file a little bit easier to read.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,910
So to do so inside my root project directory I'm going to make a new JavaScript file called timer dot

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,620
J.S. I'll then go back over to my index dot J S file I'm going to select the entire Timer class so going

11
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,940
to highlight the entire thing.

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,460
There we go.

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,920
I'll get to the bottom of the class definition.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,820
I'm going to cut it.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:01:00,940
I'm gonna go over to timer J and paste and I'll go ahead and save it then find.

16
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,130
Finally I'll go back over to index dot G.S..

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,370
Just do all that reformatting.

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,090
Just to make it look nice.

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,370
The last thing we need to do is open up our index dot each file.

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,630
We're going to make sure that we get a script tag for the timer DHHS file that we just created inside

21
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,320
of index HDL.

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:23,590
I'll find my script tag I'm gonna copy it paste a duplicate and I'll make sure that the top script tag

23
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,990
is going to get our timer dot J as file because we need to run timer dot J.S. before we can safely run

24
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:36,630
index dot J.S. to the first one right here I'll make sure says timer dot J.S. like so.

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,090
All right let's save all these files save all the changes we just made.

26
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,330
We'll just do another quick test just to make sure everything still works.

27
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,730
Yep no errors that means everything is good to go okay.

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,700
Well this looks pretty good.

29
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:53,000
So another quick pause right here and we'll actually start working on that border in just a moment.
