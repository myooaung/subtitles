1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,880
The last thing we have to do around our sign in post request handler is to make sure that we take those

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,510
errors.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,130
And if there is an error we need to make sure that we tried to re render and send down the sign and

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,660
template once again.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,690
And when we show these sign and template for a second time we need to make sure that we pass in that

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,740
Eris object and print out the appropriate errors on the screen.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,410
So once again the same thing that we just did for our sign up route so to get started inside of our

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:31,610
post request handler for Slash SIGN AND I'M GONNA DELETE THAT console log and I'll say if not errors

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,440
is empty.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:46,250
So if there is an error then let's return early and we'll do a resort sent of our sign in template.

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,610
Well then make sure that we pass in an object that has the errors that we want to eventually show on

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,020
the screen.

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,580
So I'll put an errors is errors as usual.

14
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,840
Key and value are identical.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:04,200
So a collapse it to just be errors like so now we can go back to our sign in view so views admin off

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,150
sign and J.S. we're going to receive that object with the errors inside of it.

17
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:16,660
So you're assigning J.S. going to d structure out errors and then just like we did inside of sign up

18
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,090
I can open up sign up really quickly your sign up inside the same directory we want to define the same

19
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,770
exact get error function so we can reach in there and try to find some appropriate error.

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,450
Then after that we're going to print out the appropriate error by passing in the errors object in the

21
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,100
property that we want to look up inside their it's a back inside of sine and J.S..

22
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:48,560
We'll do a concert get error will receive that errors object and the prop that we want to look up inside

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,540
of it or the property name we want to look up inside of it.

24
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,250
Then we'll do a try catch because remember we're kind of cheating here but it does technically work

25
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:58,910
just fine.

26
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:06,140
So we'll say return errors dot mapped look up that property and then return the message for it they'll

27
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,990
also put on the catch block here.

28
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,290
We don't really care if an error occurs inside of here.

29
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,750
If an error occurs it means we probably just tried to access a property that doesn't actually exist

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,540
but does return empty string from there.

31
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:25,780
Okay so now we can use to get error inside of our template it's inside the template right after we show

32
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,710
the input for the name.

33
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:36,850
I'm going to do the dollar sign curly brace and we'll do a get error with errors and a property name

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,360
of email and I'm going to copy paste that down underneath the other input and then the property that

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,850
we care about in this case is password so that should be at before we try to run this however I want

36
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,960
to point out a error that is going to very very quickly surface.

37
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,460
So if we go back to our off dot J.S. file let's take a look right here or we just added in this resource

38
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,530
sand with sine and template we threw in the object with errors so in this case we are calling sign and

39
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,720
template with an object that hasn't heirs property.

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,210
But if we go back up here to where we call sign and template right there we are calling sine and template

41
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,770
without any argument whatsoever.

42
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,050
So if we were to run our code right now we would very quickly get an error message something telling

43
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,750
us that in this scenario right here when we call sign and template and we run that function.

44
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,620
So here's sine and template right here we are trying to D structure a property from an argument that

45
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:36,070
doesn't exist because when we call sign and template from right here no argument is being passed in.

46
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,000
So the first argument is going to be undefined if we tried to D structure off of an argument that doesn't

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,590
exist.

48
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,240
We're just gonna end up getting a big error message so to fix this we could just say you know what.

49
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,460
Whenever we call a template function no matter what we're always going to pass in at least an empty

50
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,660
object.

51
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,790
Easy straightforward way to solve this it's going to make sure that sign and template right here I pass

52
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,840
in an empty object.

53
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,890
So now when I tried to D structure off of this thing there is a value to D structure off of.

54
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,850
There is no errors in this case but we've discussed that before.

55
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,140
That's totally fine if we don't find errors object.

56
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,400
That's why we set up the try catch inside of get error.

57
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:15,850
Okay.

58
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,070
So I think we're ready to actually test this out inside the browser.

59
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,730
So I'm going to go back to my browser or refresh.

60
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,450
Here's my sign in form.

61
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,390
I'm going to put in a email that I know exists.

62
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:35,750
Whoops I keep on doing Gmail but a incorrect password might sign in and I'm told invalid password.

63
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:43,560
Awesome I'll then put in a email that definitely doesn't exist in some random password and untold email

64
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,340
not found.

65
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:51,110
Then finally if I put in a valid email and a valid password and hit sign in.

66
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,350
I still am able to sign it.

67
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,030
Awesome OK.

68
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,300
Well this all works.

69
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,030
But before we move on there's one little improvement I want to make.

70
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,660
We've now written the get air function right here identically in two different files.

71
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,520
We have it inside of sine in which is where we're at right now and we have also written it out inside

72
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,520
of sign up at the very top any time that we duplicate a function.

73
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,750
It is just about always a sign we should probably extract that function into some other file and then

74
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,180
require it wherever we need it.

75
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,430
So let's create some kind of helper file inside of our views directory to store any utility function

76
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,830
like the get error function.

77
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,410
Right here inside my route views directory.

78
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:38,030
I'm going to make a new file called helpers dot J.S. inside of here.

79
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,550
I'll do a module dot exports are going to export an object that's eventually going to have many different

80
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,410
functions so any function that I want to reuse between all my different templates.

81
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:54,440
Right now there's only going to be one function the get error function so we'll just rewrite the implementation

82
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,880
right here.

83
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:01,160
We're going to receive some errors object in a property we'll set up a try catch that's the error that

84
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:09,040
we don't care about on the try case we'll do a return errors dot mapped we'll look up the property dot

85
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,240
message and then if we enter catch we'll return empty string instead okay.

86
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,010
So now that we've got this function put together inside of helpers J.S. we're going to go to sign in

87
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:26,280
and sign up we're gonna delete the get error function in both those and replace it with a required statement

88
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,920
to get the function we just put together right here so a first go to sign in J.S. I'm going to delete

89
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:42,010
get error I'll do a concert get error notice that we are just d structuring the only function that we

90
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:49,670
care about that helps us file I'm going to write out a required to go up into the admin directory up

91
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:56,850
into the view directory and then get helpers J.S. so up one directory up another helpers

92
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:07,460
we can then copy that require a statement go over to our sign up file I'll delete the get error function

93
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:15,720
we have inside of here and then paste the required statement for get error OK so let's say both these

94
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,690
files do one last quick test just to make sure we didn't introduce any typos so I'll go back to sign

95
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:27,580
in and I'll put in how about just add a quick invalid e-mail Hey very good.

96
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,810
Also go to sign up and I'll put in an email that already exists

97
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,050
and that works as well.

98
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,460
Okay well I think that that is pretty much it for functionality we've now really wrapped up the entire

99
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,610
authentication flow inside our application.

100
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,540
The only downside right now is that well our application is really really ugly.

101
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,640
So we're going to take a pause right here.

102
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,330
We're gonna come back the next video and start to add in a ton of styling to make this thing look way

103
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,940
better than it currently looks.

104
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,320
So quick possible tackle that in just a moment.
