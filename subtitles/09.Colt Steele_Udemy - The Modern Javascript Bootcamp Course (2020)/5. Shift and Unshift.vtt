00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.580
Next up we have two more array methods that have to do with removing and adding elements but rather

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.580
than adding to the end or removing from the end like push and pop shift and on shift work with the beginning

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.210
or the start of the array.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.420
So they do the same thing.

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.280
The location is different now two quick notes.

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.980
First the naming shift and on shift will probably trip you up at some point if you're brand new.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.980
I still occasionally confuse them and second the origin of the name has to do with other languages and

8
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.280
other data structures that pre-date javascript shift and on shift have kind of become standard across

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.970
programming languages even if they don't seem like they make a ton of sense.

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.860
If you want to learn more you can research stacks and Qs and you can find the origin of push pop shift

11
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.960
and unsure if and where those names come from.

12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.380
So let's start by taking a look at on shift on the docks.

13
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.680
You can see it works very similarly to push except it adds to the beginning.

14
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.240
And just like push it returns the new length of the array.

15
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.260
So let's say that I'm doing the dishes I've been recording and procrastinating and there's a big pile

16
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.740
of dishes and I'm taking them over to the sink and I'm going to stack them up.

17
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:18.770
So the first thing I'll put down let's make an array called dishes to do and I'll start with big platter

18
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.510
that goes on the bottom.

19
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:27.710
I put that down first on my counter and then I end up with a bowl next or how about a big plate.

20
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:37.010
So dishes to do dad on shift that will add to the beginning and we'll go with large plate and then I'll

21
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.770
add in another one which is small plates.

22
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.220
Notice I am getting the return value which is the new length of dishes to do.

23
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.700
And you can see that everything has been added to the beginning so we started with big platter.

24
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.200
Then I added the large plate on top and then the small plate on top and then let's say the last thing

25
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.510
I'll shift or on shift in is a cup or maybe a cereal bowl.

26
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.310
I'm definitely not drawing from real life experience I promise.

27
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.810
And then a mug and then inside the mug I put a dirty Spoon.

28
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.350
Okay so now we can see dishes to do has a length of six that was returned and it does indeed have six

29
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.120
items.

30
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.580
The order is important we added to the start each time.

31
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.520
So now let's take a look at shift which removes the first element from an array and it returns that

32
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.480
removed element so I'm going to clear my console so I have a little more space and let's say I'm ready

33
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.500
to do the dishes.

34
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.460
I have the sink on I've got the soap out.

35
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.810
The first thing I'm going to do is take that top item.

36
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.720
So dishes to do that shift and I get dirty spoon.

37
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.440
That's what I need to do next.

38
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.920
And if we look at dishes to do it is now shorter has a length of five dirty spoon is no longer at the

39
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.830
beginning.

40
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.110
Let's call shift again and we get mug and then cereal bowl.

41
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.650
Small plates will look at dishes to do now only contains two items.

42
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.770
There we go.

43
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.930
And that's pretty much it.

44
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.920
To shift and on shift they're pretty straightforward.

45
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.680
If you ignore their confusing names just add and remove to the beginning versus pushing pop which add

46
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.040
and remove to the end.

47
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.050
Now one quick note about on shift is that you can add in multiple things at once.

48
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:32.350
If I do this on shift and then I pass in multiple values so let's go with fork and knife what do you

49
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.650
think.

50
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.640
Dishes to do.

51
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.430
Looks like you can see that it added them in this order that I have here.

52
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.920
It put them in as a chunk together which is actually different than if I had on shifted them individually.

53
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.630
So I'll do it again but this time we'll do it with spoon so we'll do a small spoon and a large spoon

54
00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:05.380
so I'll do small spoon and then large spoon and we look at dishes to do the first item went in first

55
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.480
but then the second item went in front of it.

56
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.990
So all I want to show you is that um shifting items one at a time is actually different than on shifting

57
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.990
multiple at once because the order is preserved.

58
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:22.120
This entire chunk is just added in versus if we're adding to the beginning and then adding to the beginning

59
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.670
again.

60
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.960
You know we keep adding to the start that order is in reverse.

61
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.450
So yeah that's pretty much it.

62
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.080
You can unzip multiple items.

63
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.360
I didn't really show this with push but you can do this as well.

64
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:41.940
We can push one thing in we'll just push a platter to the end which kind of breaks my hold dishes idea

65
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.920
here metaphor or whatever because I would be adding a platter underneath my stack of stuff.

66
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.070
So a lot of work.

67
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.200
But if we look at dishes to do there we are now if we add in multiple things with push we'll add in.

68
00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.880
How about a cutting board and a cookie sheet like that.

69
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.180
We look at dishes to do.

70
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.530
They both were added in the order remains the same.

71
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.550
And this would work the same if I was pushing them one at a time because we're adding to the end.

72
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.860
So if I push cutting board and then I push cookie sheet it doesn't matter if I push them at once or

73
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.800
individually but with unsure if it does matter.

74
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.420
So that's it.

75
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.910
There are four different really common methods you'll see.

76
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.310
I would say out of the two push and pop are most commonly used but shift in on shift still come up quite

77
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.550
a bit as we learn more and start building things you'll see when they come into play I promise they're

78
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.420
useful.

79
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.810
Now we're going to take a look at some of the other useful Ray methods that don't necessarily have to

80
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.950
do with inserting the beginning or removing from the beginning slash and.
