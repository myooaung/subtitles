00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.430
One more thing before we really get rolling here I want to talk about a Web site called M.D. in Mozilla

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.650
Developer Network.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.750
MDA is just about the closest thing to an official documentation for javascript that we have.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.020
If you watch the video where I talked about Emma and Emma scripts in different versions new features

5
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.410
and how there's not really a official javascript that we can just go download that it's really an implementation

6
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.000
of this Xmas script spec across different browsers.

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.710
That's the same reason we don't have one official documentation.

8
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.270
It's not like a language like Python where you can go to Python scholar Python dawg and see the docs

9
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.840
for Python 2 or Python 3 with JavaScript.

10
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.150
Things are a little murkier but MDMA is a really good resource.

11
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.400
So this is what it looks like.

12
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.800
Developer dot Mozilla dot org.

13
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.360
What I do if I'm ever Googling something and I'm trying to understand how a feature works in javascript

14
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.600
I can't remember the name of a particular method.

15
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.390
All Google and ad M.D. end at the end of my google search.

16
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.940
So I get these search results.

17
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.430
So just as a quick example here we go to references and guides.

18
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.560
There are some tutorials here but if you go to technologies and you look at javascript this gives you

19
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.110
a whole reference of pretty much everything in JavaScript.

20
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.490
If we talk about arrays which we will shortly in the course if you go to the array page here there's

21
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.270
all sorts of information and tons of links about all the different things that arrays can do.

22
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.670
So you'll see me reference MDMA and quite a bit in this course and I just thought I should take a moment

23
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.170
to address it introduce the idea of empty and remember it's not an official documentation for JavaScript

24
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.290
it's put out by Mozilla the company that makes Firefox and it's just a great resource for learning javascript

25
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.980
but it's also an invaluable reference for existing developers and maybe teachers who are teaching you

26
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.570
to me courses who need to refresh their memories on certain things.

27
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.990
So you'll see it a lot in the course.
