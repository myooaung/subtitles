1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,100
Before we start writing code and getting our editor all set up I want to start with a quick discussion

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,770
around terminology.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,940
So if you're brand new to JavaScript one of the first things that might confuse you along the way are

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:19,860
some of the terms I have on the left side of this slide javascript ect my script is 20 15 16 17 18 yes

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,350
five Yes six.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,610
What do all those mean are they all just JavaScript.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,370
Let's talk about it.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,100
So javascript like most programming languages continues to grow new features are added but the way that

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,410
that happens is pretty different than most consumer software or operating systems.

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,930
If you think of something like Windows or iTunes when there's a new version or new features are added

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,450
you go and download that release everyone has that release or everyone who downloads it and you get

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,930
those new features.

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,710
It's sort of a bundled package thing you go and download it and you've got it.

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:00,900
JavaScript is a little different there actually isn't a single javascript there isn't a one javascript

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,610
download link that you go to like there might be for Windows or for iTunes instead.

16
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,960
JavaScript is implemented by all the different browsers out there and it's up to those browsers to implement

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,710
new features.

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,310
So the way that it all works is that there's an organization called Emma ACMA.

19
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,500
They have sort of a bleak Web site.

20
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,710
And Emma is an international group that is in charge of all sorts of different standards not just for

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,730
programming.

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,210
They come up with standards for things like acoustics and electromagnetic compatibility and electromagnetic

23
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:44,940
fields information storage near field communications and then there's this one right here Emma script.

24
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,170
So Emma script is a specification for a programming language.

25
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,460
You can think of it as almost like a reference.

26
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,220
It's a text document that says Here is a specification for a programming language.

27
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,950
It should behave this way.

28
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,040
It should have this feature.

29
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,450
This thing should work like this thing.

30
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,070
I don't know.

31
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,420
That's a horrible explanation.

32
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,200
It's essentially a document that describes how a language should work but it is not itself a language

33
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,150
you can go download and use.

34
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,210
It's only a description and this is it right here.

35
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,200
There is a website and you can go to to view it.

36
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,210
This is the specification for a language called Ekman script named after the organisation Emma.

37
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,320
And if you just take a look at really any piece of it you won't see much code at all.

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,860
It's mainly text explaining how different pieces should work how things are related what keywords need

39
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,270
to exist in the language.

40
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,990
So it's a set of rules.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,610
Then it's up to the browsers like Safari or Chrome or Internet Explorer to go and follow those rules

42
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,930
and implement them as javascript.

43
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,570
It gets kind of technical here.

44
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,080
There's a committee called T.S. 39 at this Emma organization.

45
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,890
They're the ones who are in charge of evolving and maintaining this massive document that describes

46
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,930
how Acme script should work.

47
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,330
And every year different delegates on this committee meet up they listen to presentations they debate

48
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,070
to figure out which new features should be added to this specification.

49
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,460
So when something is added to JavaScript what really happens is that it is added to this specification

50
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,840
as a piece of text usually a lot of text explaining how the new feature should work.

51
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,990
Then what happens is that browsers have to go and implement those changes.

52
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:36,360
Now as far as the naming here this can be a little confusing to beginners the way that updates quote

53
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,060
unquote or new features used to work with Acme script was not on an annual basis.

54
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,520
There were batches of updates or batches of new features that were added to the spec and they had names

55
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,970
like iOS 5.

56
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,690
There was actually no iOS for it was cancelled but there were these these groups of new features that

57
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,540
were added and it took forever like a bunch of years in between these updates to the spec and after

58
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,100
iOS 6 was released which took about six years.

59
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:11,010
The committee decided to change things up and just annually update the spec so naming started to go

60
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:18,060
by yes for a script and then instead of a version number like four or five or six it's now a year.

61
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,790
So yes 2015 yes 2016 yes 2017.

62
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,540
So all of these terms over here on the left are referring to well except for JavaScript they're all

63
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:34,740
referring to this specification document iOS 6 is the same as iOS 2015 and it all boils down to this

64
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:41,670
one document that we saw in Texas being added in to describe how a feature should work.

65
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,030
So what's what's kind of annoying about all this.

66
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,860
To be honest is that since there is no official download or an easy way just to get JavaScript as a

67
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,710
language and update it automatically because it's all implemented by separate browsers.

68
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,830
This means that different browsers will support different features at any given point time and there

69
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,110
are Web sites that exist specifically to help you understand this.

70
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,450
One is called Can I use dot com.

71
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,740
And if we search for some feature on here which if you're brand new to JavaScript it doesn't really

72
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,850
matter what I type in here but I'm going to look for something called Aero functions.

73
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,400
And here we have a compatibility chart telling me which browsers support aero functions and when they

74
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,250
started if they started aero functions are a newer feature in the spec they're not supported by Internet

75
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,510
Explorer at all.

76
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,390
They were added to Firefox and Chrome a couple of years ago.

77
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,440
So a chart like this helps you understand that not every feature is going to be available in every browser

78
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,170
and that all boils down to the nature of JavaScript.

79
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,340
It is not one language necessarily a bunch of implementations of the same specification.

80
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,120
Oh what a way to lead the course off.

81
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,630
I know it's not it's not the most exciting topic but I have to get this out of the way because a lot

82
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:01,670
of what we're going to talk about in this course are newer features things that are exciting and worth

83
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,360
knowing about.

84
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,060
But I'll say things like this feature is not supported in Internet Explorer and I want you to understand

85
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,040
why that is.

86
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,260
Why do some browsers have certain features and others don't.

87
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,610
Okay enough of that.

88
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,740
Let's get started with setting up our environment and then dive into code.
