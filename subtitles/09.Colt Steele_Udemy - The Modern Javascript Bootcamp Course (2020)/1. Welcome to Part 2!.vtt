Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.520
My name is Steven Greider and I'm going to be taking over for cold for part two on this course.

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.260
Congratulations on making it this far.

4
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.440
Hopefully you've had fun so far and you're ready to keep learning a lot more about JavaScript.

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.060
And right away I want to tell you that part two of this course is going to be a little bit different

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:22.070
than part one in part one you were learning a lot of different individual topics around javascript.

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.430
You were really focused on the basic features of the language so understanding things like objects classes

8
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.280
functions and so on.

9
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.770
And you were in general not building a lot of larger apps.

10
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.360
So in part two we're really going to change the structure of the core significantly and we're going

11
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.310
to have a very different structure.

12
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.620
So in part two we're going to be covering your topics but every topic that we do cover is going to be

13
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.750
in way greater detail.

14
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.820
So this is where you're going to really get to apply all of your newfound javascript skills.

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.930
In addition we're going to have a lot more focus on design patterns and some more advanced concepts

16
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.630
and features of javascript.

17
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.760
So this is a lot more about building larger applications and really giving you some experience and confidence

18
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.190
in building your own apps unless Lessing want to mention is that as we go through this second part of

19
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.230
the course for all these different apps we build we're going to be doing a lot of refactoring the idea

20
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.930
here is that I want to show you for every app several different ways to approach any given problem.

21
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.560
I don't want to show you just one way and say this is it.

22
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.610
This is the only way to build this application.

23
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.040
Instead I want to give you a tool box that you can use and a toolbox different skills to build your

24
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.150
own apps.

25
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.600
So now that we have a better idea of what we're going to be doing inside of part two.

26
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.050
Let's take a quick pause right here.

27
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.070
We're going to come back the next video and start to discuss the first application that we're going

28
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.730
to be working on.
