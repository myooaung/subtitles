00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.010
In this video we're going to look at some different diagrams to understand how to calculate the different

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.840
dimensions so we're going to pass into the rectangle function so the first thing I want to do is go

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.720
back up to the top of the file all the way at the top.

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.010
I just want to remind you very quickly that we've got a couple of different constant variables declared

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.210
right here.

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.900
We've got cells which is the number of cells in either the horizontal or vertical direction.

7
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.800
And we've got a width and height and very critically.

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.590
Right now we are saying that the height and width are always going to be identical to each other.

9
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.610
Eventually we're going to allow these two values to vary to get a rectangular maze.

10
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.820
But right now they are always going to be perfectly the same.

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.490
So if we think about these the combination of these two dimensions together we can start to imagine

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.750
that at the end of the day every cell is going to be 200 units wide because 600 divided by three is

13
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.140
200.

14
00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.340
So I'm going to define a little variable underneath here called unit length unit length is essentially

15
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.550
saying that every cell that I create is going to be this many units tall and this many units wide.

16
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.020
So to calculate the unit with or seeing the unit length we would do a with divide by cells.

17
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.700
And of course we could do height instead.

18
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.570
It really doesn't matter right now because again height width are always going to be identical.

19
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.660
So again at unit length is going to be this length of one side of one of our cells.

20
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.160
So just keep that variable in mind for half a second.

21
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.420
We're going to need to use that variable in order to figure out how to draw our individual wells.

22
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.500
So I'm going to go over to a quick diagram and let's draw some stuff out here.

23
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.360
Right now we are iterating over our horizontals array.

24
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.440
We know that that is going to be a 2D array it's going to have the two different rows

25
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.700
to represent that row and that row right there.

26
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.890
Each of those different wall segments I'm going to throw some imaginary values in here.

27
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:08.480
So I'm going to say maybe we've got TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE so now if I wanted to reflect what

28
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.500
actual wells we need to draw I'm going to erase a couple elements here so we would have no wall right

29
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:25.090
there we would have no wall right there then we would have no wall right there now using that information

30
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:32.820
we need to somehow figure out how we can draw this rectangle this rectangle and this rectangle we're

31
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.500
going to first focus on how to draw the one at the top.

32
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.310
This one right here.

33
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.440
So we need to figure out how to go from our origin point which remember is on the top left corner that

34
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:52.720
is our 0 0 we need to first figure out how far over we need to go to get the center points of that rectangle

35
00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.740
and then we also need to figure out how far down we need to go to get the center point as well in the

36
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.080
vertical direction.

37
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.750
So in other words we need to figure out what that is right there.

38
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.330
So when we think about the Y dimension.

39
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.430
So this off here to the left hand side we're essentially saying that we want to go down the height of

40
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.700
one cell.

41
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.790
So that is why we just created that unit length variable to get the central point right there.

42
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:30.160
We're going to first go down units length so in our case that is going to be the whatever it was was

43
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.690
it two hundred pixels.

44
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.970
So we've be going down 200 units not be the center point right there on the vertical direction then

45
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.210
the x direction to that center point.

46
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:48.640
So this horizontal direction would be one and a half cells over.

47
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.550
So that would be unit length

48
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.800
times one point five.

49
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.410
That's how we're going to figure out how we get to the center point of that segment right there but

50
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.730
just doing like unit length times one point five isn't super useful because if we start to think about

51
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.220
how to show these other ones like that segment or that segment Well it's very clear that this is not

52
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.010
just a function of the unit length but it's also a function of what row these center points or these

53
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.450
segments are occurring on and what column as well.

54
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.750
So in other words as we start to think about how did the central point of that next one down it's going

55
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.370
to actually be unit length times two.

56
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.550
So how do we kind of calculate that distance right there based on the unit length and what row it is

57
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.700
on and what column it is on.

58
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.170
Well let me just show you the math.

59
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.970
Give you an idea of how this is all going to work out in order to get the center point of all these

60
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.220
horizontal segments.

61
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.720
We need to get the column index that we are currently working on.

62
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.430
So in this case for the top one that we were just discussing we do some deletion here

63
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.500
so for the top element.

64
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.820
This one again right here we are operating on column index 0 1.

65
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:28.260
So 1 in this case and we are operating on row index 0 so we need to do the column index times our unit

66
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.590
length

67
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:44.000
was unit length divided by two that's what is going to give us the extra direction or the X distance

68
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.090
like so we can try to use this equation right here to figure out the x direction for each of these different

69
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.950
segments.

70
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.560
So for example if we want to figure out the x direction distance for this one on the bottom left right

71
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.280
here.

72
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.400
That would be column index of 0.

73
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.600
So we would do 0 plus two hundred or so mean times 200

74
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:16.640
0 times 200 plus 200 divided by 2 which equals 100.

75
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.800
So that means that we would have 100 units over to get to the x direction that central point and if

76
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.480
we want to try to apply that formula again for this original one right here that would be our column

77
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:36.620
index which in this case is 1 times 200 plus 2 100 divided by 2.

78
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.600
And that gives us three hundred which is definitely correct.

79
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:49.200
And then finally for the last one down here it would be a column index of two times 200 plus 200 over

80
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:56.630
to now would give us what 500 which is correct as well because overall we've got 600.

81
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:03.410
So we essentially want to go back 100 units now would be 500 to that center point right there again

82
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.100
in the x direction.

83
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.740
Now we've got that versatile formula.

84
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.380
Let's try to write out that code back can we create a rectangle and we'll think about the vertical direction.

85
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:18.470
After that it's on bodies dot rectangle the x coordinate here will be at column index

86
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.340
times the unit length

87
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.930
plus the unit length divided by two.

88
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.950
Now we don't have any variables inside of your called column index.

89
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.070
So how do we figure out what kind of column we are currently iterating over and what row we're iterating

90
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.700
over as well.

91
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.730
We'll remember the second argument inside the for each functions.

92
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.790
The first argument is the actual value where we are iterating over the second argument is the index

93
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.210
of that element.

94
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:53.080
So for row right here we would also have a second argument of row index and that tells us what row we

95
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.550
are currently operating on.

96
00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:00.730
And for the second one we have the column index that is what column we are currently iterating on.

97
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.550
Now we can repeat the same process for the y direction as well.

98
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.060
They're gonna do a little bit of you racier

99
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.100
a little bit more

100
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.590
and it's gonna draw in a couple more segments here by hand.

101
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.750
There we go.

102
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:34.710
Now we want to get that segment that segment and that segment and now we're talking about this y direction.

103
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.180
So how far down do we want to get this thing.

104
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.930
Let's first think about this segment right here.

105
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:45.490
So how do we get that segment based upon our ROE index column index and our unit length.

106
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.560
Well in this case it is going to be our ROE index.

107
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.260
So that is going to be like this direction or this Roe right here which is our first Roe.

108
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.810
So it's going to be our ROE index

109
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:09.540
times the unit length and then in this case it's going to be plus the unit length let's try to plug

110
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:16.700
in some numbers to get the y coordinate or the y direction to that center point right there so I would

111
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:24.840
do a roe index of 1 times are unit length of 200 plus our unit length of 200.

112
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.580
And that would be 400.

113
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.920
So that means to draw out the Y's coordinate of this wall right here.

114
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:38.990
It would be 400 units and if we think about this one right here that would be a roe index in this case

115
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:46.320
of 0 0 times the unit length of two hundred plus two hundred gives us 200.

116
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.120
That means go down 200 hundred units to get that one and then this one right here.

117
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.030
It's the same math as that one that we did just a moment ago.

118
00:09:53.080 --> 00:10:00.460
So that would be on Roe index of 1 times 200 plus 200 gives us 400.

119
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.350
Again all right.

120
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.820
So I know this math is kind of nasty but this is pretty much what has to be done.

121
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.680
So hey we got to talk about it one way or another.

122
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:13.870
Now let's write out the equation where the y coordinate of this rectangle as well so I'll put a comma

123
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:24.780
in there we're going to get wrote index times unit length plus the unit length okay.

124
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.400
Now that the third and fourth arguments these are gonna be way easier.

125
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.030
So this is going to be how wide and how tall we want the rectangle to be.

126
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:39.440
So in this case we know that we want our wall to be like that long like whatever the width of one cell

127
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:39.700
is.

128
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.350
That's how long we want it to be.

129
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.990
And that is the direction in the x axis.

130
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.590
So that is gonna be the third argument right here.

131
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.260
We want that to be unit length units long.

132
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:57.030
So essentially the width of one cell and that is what unit length represents and then the fourth argument

133
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.060
is going to be how tall we want the wall to be.

134
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:05.430
So essentially like is it going to be a really tall like that or is it gonna be just very very thin

135
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.900
like almost appearing to be a line.

136
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.390
Well we can just throw in some test value.

137
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.370
I gonna use like a fixed value of 10 here.

138
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:16.300
So I got to say that my wall is going to be 10 units tall.

139
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.680
All right.

140
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:23.610
So finally a last argument to the rectangle creation we're going to make sure that we also mark this

141
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:28.260
thing as static so that it doesn't kind of fly all around once we start to draw it on the screen.

142
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.130
So say is static is true it's now that we've created that wall.

143
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:41.220
We can add it into our world and to add in that shape we will call world dot add we're gonna add to

144
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:47.810
the world object we had created earlier and I want to add this wall okay.

145
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.290
I know this has been some nasty math but like I said we had to go through it.

146
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.480
So now we've got that done.

147
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.580
I'll save the file.

148
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.750
I'm going to go back over and do a quick test and I can see one wallop here right there.

149
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.660
Now I can refresh this every time I'm gonna see some walls appear in different locations to represent

150
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.860
kind of like the randomness of the maze we are creating.

151
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.670
So that's definitely working correctly or at least I think it's working correctly.

152
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:16.860
We won't know for sure until we also draw in the vertical segments as well so that you can guess what's

153
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:17.310
next.

154
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.540
Let's take a quick pause right here.

155
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.650
We're going to come back to the next video we can add in some very similarly looking code to handle

156
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.850
the creation of all the vertical wall segments.
