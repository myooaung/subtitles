00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,140
Last video we spoke about something called a layout.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,120
So let's start to put one together right now.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,830
Remember the goal this is to have some reuse of the different each HTML elements we want to have on

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,740
every page of our application so to get started I'm going to go back over to my project directory.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:23,510
I'm going to find the view's admin folder then inside of admin I'm going to make a new file called layout

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,590
that J.S. as I mentioned just a moment ago an application commonly will only have one layout.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,600
So that means essentially at one H.G. it kind of scaffold or skeleton that gets reused for every page

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,850
in an application for our application.

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,680
We're going to have two different layouts eventually we're going to have one layout that is customized

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,590
for the administration panel.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,100
We're going to have a second layout that is customized for the actual user facing side of our Web site

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,350
which is the product listing Andy cart so the reason we are creating creating this layout file inside

13
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,120
the admin directory is that this is going to be the layout files specifically for the administration

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:09,290
side of our product so then inside of here we'll do a module that exports.

15
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,030
This is going to overall look very similar to the view files or the template fold files that we just

16
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,440
put together.

17
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,670
So I'm going to expect that we're going to call this function once again with an object and I'm going

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,380
to expect that it will have a property called Content.

19
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:30,440
Content is going to be a string that is essentially whatever we want to put in this body tag right here.

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,220
So inside of our string template that we're going to return from this function we're going to write

21
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,920
out all of our very common each small elements.

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,050
And then inside the body we're going to do some string interpolation and throw this content argument

23
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:42,860
inside there.

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,350
So that's how we're going to essentially inject the contents of sine and template or sign up template

25
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:57,140
so inside of here we'll do a return to line string lock type.

26
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,540
It's simple I'll do my each team T.M. I'll do my head

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,620
the body and then inside the body will do some string interpolation.

28
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:21,210
So remember that is our dollar sign curly braces and inside there will throw content like so it's now

29
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,840
in order to make use of this layout.

30
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,970
We're gonna go around to all of our different views which right now is just our sign in and sign up

31
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,320
J.S. files.

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,790
We're going to require in this layout function and we're going to wrap that each smell that we are returning

33
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,460
inside of each of those different functions inside a sign in and sign up with the function right here.

34
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:49,900
So I'm going to go to sign and J.S. at the top I'll say layout is up one directory layout and then rather

35
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:58,810
than directly returning the string I'm going to instead say layout I'm going to pass in an object it's

36
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,240
going to have a content property and the value of that is going to be the string that we are.

37
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,190
Where were returning right here.

38
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,900
Well then close off that object on the other side along with the setup parentheses.

39
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:18,930
And I'm going to fix that multi line string just indented to make everything kind of lineup like so.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,240
So again recalling layouts we're passing in an object that has a content property the content property

41
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,770
is a string.

42
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:31,000
So then inside of layout J.S. we're going to receive that content property but all of our typical H

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,160
channel structure together.

44
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,930
And then through the content inside the body now we can repeat that same process inside of our sign

45
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,080
up J.S. file.

46
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,810
So I'll find sign up J.S.

47
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:52,700
again at the very top of this file I will require in my layout function well then call me out right

48
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,960
here.

49
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,780
I'm going to pass in an object with the content property or close off the object and the parentheses

50
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,040
for the function on the other side.

51
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,750
Save it and we end up with something like this right here.

52
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:10,890
Okay.

53
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,800
So this looks pretty good.

54
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,250
Now if we ever need to make any change to the kind of root structure of our e-mail document we will

55
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,110
open up our layouts J.S. file and we can make changes to this thing directly right here.

56
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,480
So if we ever want to make sure that every page on our Administration panel has say a script tag or

57
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,550
link tag or whatever else we can add that directly into our layout right here that we'll make sure that

58
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,790
every single page gets that little snippet of each email.

59
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,140
That means that we don't have to duplicate the stuff all over the place inside of our app.

60
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:47,670
Let's save this and do a quick test so I'm just going to go back over to my sign and root refresh.

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,070
Yep everything still works.

62
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,320
I'll go to my sign up out everything still works okay.

63
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:00,670
So that's definitely a good improvement so that's gonna fix up one big deficiency inside of our project

64
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,260
but there's still one other big ticket item I want to discuss.

65
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,290
So let's take a pause right here.

66
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,910
Come back next video discuss the other big issue.

67
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,160
This is going to be the last big thing that we have to fix up inside this before we start to focus on

68
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,890
the product side of our application.
