1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,100
Well I may have just lied to you.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,470
We're not quite a variables.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,620
We have one more very quick topic to discuss with numbers.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,890
Something called NASA.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,290
It is a special value in JavaScript.

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,030
It stands for Not a number.

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,340
And it is a number in JavaScript.

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,080
It's considered a numeric value that represents something that is not a number.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,440
So there's a couple of different ways you could arrive at not a number.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,970
Here are two simple ones.

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,760
If you try and divide zero by zero you'll get not a number.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,200
If you try and take not a number and add a number to it.

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,200
The answer is still not a number which makes sense.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,140
You couldn't take not a number and add five to it.

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,190
The answer logically would be not a number.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,030
So you can type not a number like this.

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,040
It is capital N A N if you did and and like this it's not really going to work.

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,730
It needs to be capitalized correctly.

19
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,830
It's a very special value in JavaScript and it is a number as I mentioned already.

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,810
If we do zero divided by zero we get not a number.

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,500
If we take not a number we add five.

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,190
It's still not a number.

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,370
There are two other values I mentioned we have infinity which we can generate by doing something like

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,100
1 divided by zero javascript just has a way of representing a value of infinity.

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,500
There's no way to store that as a number an actual number that you could see.

26
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,790
So we have a special value called Infinity.

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,270
There's also a negative infinity as you can see here.

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:32,040
And we also have zero and negative zero which sometimes throws people off negative zero is its own value

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,370
in JavaScript as well.

30
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,460
But the point here is really about not a number.

31
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,530
If you do encounter not a number it is a value that means this is not a number.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,200
It doesn't necessarily mean something went wrong.

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,240
Sometimes you you have code where you're expecting not a number or it could be a possibility.

34
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,850
So it's not an error necessarily but it means this is not standard math or JavaScript is going to have

35
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,560
a hard time representing this number or this value as a true numeric value.

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,650
So that's an and not a number.

37
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,280
Now we're actually going on to variables.
