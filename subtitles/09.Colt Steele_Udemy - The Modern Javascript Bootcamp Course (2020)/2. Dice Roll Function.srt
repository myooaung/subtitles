1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,520
Let's try writing another function this time.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,360
Something that doesn't just print grumpy text over and over and over.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,460
Let's do something with some variation.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,630
How about generating a random dice roll or a single die roll.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,140
So a number from zero.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,610
Nope.

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,100
There's no zero day 1 to 6.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,540
And we'll name this function something that makes sense like roll die.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,930
So we need function space roll die curly braces.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,420
And now we need the logic to generate a random number from 0 to 6.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,150
So let's roll equal.

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,890
And then we'll do math at random.

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,400
You know how much I'm not a fan of this syntax.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,240
I thought random times 6.

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,690
And then we need to floor that math top floor.

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,590
Remember math at random gives us a decimal so it would be like zero point two.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,370
And then we multiply by six in order to get a larger range.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,430
So we're no longer just from zero to one.

19
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:03,660
We're going from zero to I guess right below six because the largest decimal will generate as point

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,150
nine something we multiply by six.

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,610
And then we floor it to get rid of the decimal.

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,700
So now we have a number from zero to five.

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,210
But our dice roll or die roll should be from 1 to 6.

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,570
So we add 1.

25
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,850
The logic is not all that important.

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,550
Really we're still focusing on the fact that every time we call it roll die.

27
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,860
This code runs.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,480
This code happens to make a number from one to 6 a random number.

29
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:40,520
And then let's consider log rolled and then string template literal the roll refresh the page.

30
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,360
Nothing happens because we never executed this.

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,390
We just registered it.

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,710
We told javascript about it.

33
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,660
So we will now execute it once we get rolled to rolled 3 4 5.

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,420
Cool and we can do this within a loop if we wanted to.

35
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:04,140
We can even call functions within other functions so some games will have you roll a bunch of dice at

36
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,420
the same time like Yahtzee.

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,540
I think you roll five or six.

38
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:15,630
I know there's other a bunch of other games not much of a gambler but let's make up a function called.

39
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,430
How about throw dice and throw dice.

40
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,470
We'll simply call roll die.

41
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,950
How about six times.

42
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,620
We could do it like this or we could do it with a loop but just to make it simple and clear that it's

43
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,890
running six times.

44
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,440
I'll do it manually by writing it out six times a loop would probably make more sense if we wanted to

45
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,690
have throw dice in the future potentially change the number of roles so we could have throw dice to

46
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,900
throw dice 6 for different games but this is good enough we're not there yet.

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,820
We'll refresh the page nothing happens and that's because I haven't executed either function so I'm

48
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,990
going to call throw dice if I can spell it.

49
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,940
Which in turn calls roll die six different times each time this code runs and we get some number printed

50
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,940
out.

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,030
There we go.

52
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,780
4 6 1 4 2 2.

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,290
So we've seen more repetition of how we define a function but also the new component here is that we

54
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,400
can call functions from inside other functions.

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,310
We can call them in loops you can call them in conditionals we can call them pretty much anywhere.
