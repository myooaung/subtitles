00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.580
Now there a better idea of how we're going to design this shopping cart feature let's get to work.

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.500
So in this video we're going to put together a little bit of boilerplate.

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.280
So it's going to take the form of creating a new routes file that's going to handle all the different

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.780
root handlers around routes.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.270
We might create a new view's directory for handling showing the cart related stuff and a new repository

6
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.890
as well for managing all the different carts so we eventually create let's first get started with the

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.110
repository.

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:32.000
So inside the repositories directory I'm going to make a new file called carts dot J.S. the cart repository

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.880
that we create is going to be very similar to the products one.

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.530
So we don't really have any special methods.

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.560
We want to add in we really just want to make a new extended copy of repository and eventually maybe

12
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.710
we will add in some additional methods to our cart.

13
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.460
So instead of carts J.S. I'm going to first require in repository at the top

14
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.230
will then create our class called carts repository and that's going to be extending

15
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:11.290
repository and then at the bottom we'll do a module on exports of new hearts repository and remember

16
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.480
the first argument is going to be the name of the file that we want to store all this data in.

17
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.050
So we're gonna call it cart Scott.

18
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.860
Jason Okay.

19
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.320
So good start right there.

20
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.620
Next up let's create a new routes file for holding all the different routes around our cart.

21
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.410
So inside the routes directory I'll make a new file called carts dot J.S. so then inside of here we'll

22
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.760
create a new express router object and associate some different route handlers with it.

23
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.890
So I'll get express

24
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.340
I'll create a new router we'll eventually add in some routes to it.

25
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.620
So like a router dot get blah blah blah.

26
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.930
But right now we will just leave it empty until we know exactly what routes we want to add.

27
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.710
So at the bottom I'll do a module on exports of router.

28
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.110
And then finally we'll open up our root index dot ust file we'll make sure that we require in the router

29
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.370
that we just created an associated with our Express at inside of index J Yes I'll go right underneath

30
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.900
products router I'll get my Curt's router which is what we've just created

31
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.820
and then we'll associate Kurt's router with our app object.

32
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.900
So right underneath the admin products router that we set up previously will do an app that use parts

33
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.780
router.

34
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.480
So that looks good.

35
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.340
So we've now gone through just a little bit of boilerplate to get the stuff set up.

36
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.550
So now we need to think about the different routes so we need to associate with our router.

37
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.590
In total there are going to be three different ways that we can access and modify this router.

38
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.540
That's going to somehow deal with modify or display different card related stuff so that three different

39
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.130
routes that are going to end up having are going to be the button that we're going to click to add an

40
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.640
item to a cart.

41
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.590
So this button right here is gonna trigger a form submission.

42
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.450
So we're going to make a post request to our back end.

43
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.970
We're gonna handle that inside of our carts file that we've just created and we're inside of that root

44
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.420
handler.

45
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.190
We're going to attempt to take whatever item the user just clicked on and add it to a shopping cart.

46
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.560
So that's going to be number one the second root handler that we'll put together is for this entire

47
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.450
page right here where we show the entire shopping cart in a listing of every product inside their and

48
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.680
that third route that we're going to associate with our shopping cart is the delete buttons here on

49
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.890
the right hand side.

50
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.010
So if we click on a delete button that should also trigger a foreign submission our server will receive

51
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.930
that request and delete the associated item from our shopping cart.

52
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.460
So again in total three different routes we're going to set up inside this route.

53
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.570
Handler I'm going to put some comments down just to guide myself.

54
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.690
So remember those three different routes we need to create.

55
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.730
So first we need to receive a post request to add an item to a cart.

56
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.540
We also need to receive a get request to show all items in cart.

57
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:21.390
And then finally receive a host to delete an item from a cart.

58
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.630
All right.

59
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.320
So now that we've got a little bit of structure here and we understand what we're going to put together

60
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.000
quick pause and we'll get started with receiving a post request to add an item to a cart in the next

61
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.420
video.
