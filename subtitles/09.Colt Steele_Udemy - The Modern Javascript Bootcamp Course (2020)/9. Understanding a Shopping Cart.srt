1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,090
In this video we're going to start to figure out how we can handle these.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,560
Add to Cart functionality inside of our app so the end goal here is to allow a user to say OK I want

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,670
these gloves right here.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,830
Click on the Add To Cart button and then take some record of these gloves right here with this title

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,760
and that price and add it to a shopping cart.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,060
We'll eventually then show user all the different products they've added to their shopping cart whenever

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,380
they go to that cart page.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,830
We have a link to up here on the top right hand side.

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,600
So in this video we're going to start to figure out how we can essentially represent a shopping cart

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:37,490
inside of our application and how a user is going to interact with that shopping cart before we start

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,030
to think about our application in too much detail.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,470
I first want to give you a quick demonstration of how Amazon.com handles a shopping cart.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:51,320
So quick demonstration I'm going to open up a new incognito window inside my browser and then navigate

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,520
to Amazon.com once I get here.

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,100
You'll notice that I am not signed into amazon so I'm not authenticated or anything like that and then

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,490
going to scroll down I'm going to find some random product like how about these sunglasses right here.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,920
I click on that product and then on the right hand side I'm going to click on Add To Cart.

18
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,270
So that's essentially the exact same kind of button that you and I want to implement.

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,190
So ideally we might just do whatever Amazon is doing right.

20
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,810
I mean can make sense.

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,660
So I got to click on that button and as soon as I do I get presented with a window that says OK fantastic.

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,780
You added those sunglasses to your shopping cart and then I can click on the cart button right here

23
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:37,080
and it will take me to a page that lists all the different items that I currently have inside my cart.

24
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,570
The really important thing to understand here the entire purpose of this demo.

25
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,410
I want you to understand that I have interacted with Amazon's product.

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,670
I have a shopping cart.

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,310
I have some items inside of my shopping cart.

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,820
But I am not logged in.

29
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,930
I have not signed in.

30
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,220
I'm not authenticated.

31
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,830
I don't have any kind of Amazon account right now or anything like that so in order to implement some

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,810
system like this some system like Amazon has where you can have a shopping cart without signing in or

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,490
anything like that there are really two big questions that we have to answer.

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,530
The two big questions we have to figure out is how do we somehow tie a shopping cart to a person who

35
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,740
is never going to be logged in.

36
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,300
So we want the user to go through our entire application like the entire shopping side experience without

37
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,340
ever having to create an account.

38
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,310
Remember the original idea behind all that authentication stuff.

39
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,300
We said Oh yeah.

40
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,620
The only point of authentication or logging into our application was to be able to get access to the

41
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,880
administration panel.

42
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,040
That was the only reason we put in any kind of authentication so you should not have to log into our

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,760
account in order to have a shopping cart.

44
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,180
So that's the big problem we need to figure out.

45
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,970
After that there is kind of a secondary problem.

46
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:56,140
So once we figure out how to kind of tie a shopping cart to a person who is using our Web site how can

47
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,120
we somehow figure out what different products are in that cart.

48
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,110
So again two problems and they're really the two kind of stages of the life cycle of a shopping cart.

49
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,390
How do we assign a person to a cart and then how do we assign a product to a cart.

50
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,950
That's a big thing we have to figure out.

51
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,500
So quick pause right here.

52
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,800
When we come back the next video we're going to start to discuss our solution to problem number one.
