1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,530
Next up we need to talk about something called the event object.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,390
So when this function is called Let's go with the change colored function.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,250
It's called When we click on a box or a user clicks on a box.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,040
We're never executing change color ourself.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,720
It's being called for us.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,880
And it's actually passed a value it's past an event object in this event objects sometimes is extremely

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,350
useful to have access to in our callback in our event handler.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,270
So we have access to it.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,860
It's automatically passed every single time.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,320
We're just not capturing it in change color.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,260
We're ignoring it but if we were to add in a parameter here you could call it anything.

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,780
Usually you'll see E or event or even t any of them is fine.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,350
I'll go with EVP.

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,260
Why don't we just see what it contains.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,180
Console that log evey t I'll refresh my page.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:01,640
We click on one of these and it's an event object which contains information about the particular event.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,450
So it's a mouse event.

18
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:10,320
You can see where it occurred on my screen the screen X and screen y why we can see what else.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,050
We have this property path which is kind of interesting.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,180
It shows everything that we clicked on.

21
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,420
Yes we did click on a div with the class of box but it was instead of a section with the idea of boxes

22
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,310
and that's inside the body inside the chemo element inside the document inside the window.

23
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:33,990
We clicked on all of those other things like was the shift key depressed the timestamp for when it happened

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,740
after the page loaded all that stuff is contained in this one object if we instead had a different type

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:49,020
of event listener setup why don't we do a keyboard event a key press or a key up a key down let's add

26
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,060
in a simple input here or actually let's even just do it on the body.

27
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,650
So if you type any key while you're on this web page let's alert the key or do something with it.

28
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:10,290
So all select document dump body dot add event listener and we'll do a key press we'll talk more about

29
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:16,110
these events the particular key events and form events in the next video but I just want to show this

30
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:23,340
function we'll work with the event object we'll use it and why don't we just cancel that log the event

31
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:32,180
object so keep press on the body of the document so anywhere on this page if I type a key Okay I just

32
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,030
typed the key I typed another one and the reason I'm showing this key event is that often we need to

33
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,780
know which key has been pressed and that information is contained in the event object we don't say key

34
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:53,780
press of a key press of Z key we just say key press any key that is pressed we'll fire this event and

35
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,250
call this function.

36
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,040
So if we want to know was it the enter key was it the.

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,180
I don't know w a as D key was it an arrow key then we use the event object which is automatically passed

38
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:12,560
in and if we open it this time it is a keyboard event not a mouse event and we have a bunch of things

39
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,530
like key that is a very important one if you want to know just the basic key that was pressed although

40
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:24,350
it doesn't always work the way you might expect for example if I press shift my event is not firing

41
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:30,590
but if I instead do shift ah it does fire but we'll save that for the next video all you should know

42
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:40,910
is that we have access to information about the particular key that was pressed so ah or w p o i u and

43
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,330
so on.

44
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,900
Okay so the event object is a very useful part of working with events if you need information about

45
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:55,100
the events whether it's what was clicked on or what key was pressed what time after the page loaded

46
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,520
where on the screen the coordinates exactly.

47
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,690
There's a bunch of different pieces of information you can access using that event object.
