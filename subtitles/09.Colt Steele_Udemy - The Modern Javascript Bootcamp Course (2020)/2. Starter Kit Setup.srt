1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,830
Now that we have a better idea of what we're trying to build.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,360
Let's get started working on this application before we write any code however I want to go through

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,320
a couple of different steps here to make sure that we've got a really solid plan on how we're going

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,270
to tackle this application.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:18,400
The first thing we're going to do is set up a little boilerplate for our project so attached to this

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,330
video there is a zip file that has some starter files inside of it.

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,500
If you haven't downloaded that zip file already and pause the video and download the zip file right

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,560
now I've already downloaded that zip file and I've extracted its contents onto my computer inside of

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,360
that zip file are three different files.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,980
The index not HDL file a javascript file and a CSX file.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,170
Once you get those files on your computer make sure you also open them up inside of your code.

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,360
Ed. So I've already done that right here.

13
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,750
Here's the small file.

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:53,520
The JavaScript file in the C Ss 1 then finally makes sure you open up the index not each email file

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,800
inside of your browser.

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:00,010
Once you do so you're going to see a initial screen like this right here OK.

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,420
So once you've got that all set up on a very quickly just mentioned exactly what this term boilerplate

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,970
is referring to when we talk about a boilerplate package we're talking about some essentially starter

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,050
code for a project usually a boilerplate.

20
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,370
We'll have a little bit of setup already done inside of it.

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,860
And usually it's going to have some code or h t mail or styling that is generally kind of repetitive

22
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,120
between different projects.

23
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,660
So it's really just a good starting point to begin from.

24
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,300
I know that sometimes using a starter package is kind of annoying and you might prefer to write out

25
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,460
everything from scratch.

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,300
So you really understand what is going on just so you know the only real setup that I've done inside

27
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,710
of this little boilerplate package is for the most part just some styling.

28
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:48,000
So just some C Ss to make sure that the end product that we end up with is going to look really nice.

29
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,800
This is of course about JavaScript and Nazi SS and that's why I did all these C Ss for you upfront.

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,080
You can't of course review that CSX file at the end of this application and get a better idea of what's

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,270
going on inside there if you want to OK.

32
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,440
So now that we've got a little bit of setup done let's take a pause right here and then identify some

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,230
challenging aspects of this project in the next video.
