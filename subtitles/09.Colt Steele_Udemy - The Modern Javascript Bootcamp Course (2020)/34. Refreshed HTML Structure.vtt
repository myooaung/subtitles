00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.900
Are auto complete widget is working out pretty well.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.780
So now the last thing I want to do is actually go back to the original application that we're working

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.240
on.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.760
We need to make sure that we essentially have two different auto completes being displayed and they

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.620
need to kind of show up next to each other in like two separate columns.

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.280
We should also make sure that when the user first loads up the app we show some kind of tutorial message

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.320
on the screen as well and tell them exactly what to do.

8
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.810
So in this video we're gonna change our aged email structure a little bit to make sure that we get these

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.760
two different columns and that tutorial message we're gonna do a lot of typing inside of our index dot

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.870
each team file.

11
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.810
So going to open that up right away.

12
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.560
Once again a lot of the different classes that we're going to add in here are taken directly from the

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.660
bull must the SS library.

14
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.330
We're not going to focus too much on the class names or the styling because again class about JavaScript

15
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.920
that's where here for it.

16
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.840
Let's get to it inside of here.

17
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.210
I'm going to first begin by deleting the two elements we have inside of class container.

18
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.530
So we're going to essentially just rewrite all the structure we have inside of class container and then

19
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.460
going to create a class or did with class of columns inside there.

20
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.330
I'm going to do a div with the class of column notice there's no s on there.

21
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.680
The one before I had an s.

22
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:24.080
This one doesn't inside of this one I'm going to show a div with an I.D. of left dash auto complete.

23
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.980
So as you would guess we're going to eventually use this as the root element for the autocomplete that

24
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.690
we're going to show on the left hand side.

25
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.390
I'm using a div here just to 100 percent identify this thing as a very unique element inside of my application

26
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.160
and I only ever want to have one with that I.D..

27
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.190
I'm gonna close off the div with class column right there and then after it I'm going to put another

28
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.120
day with the class

29
00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.590
and inside there I'll do another div with an idea of write dash auto autocomplete and I'll close it

30
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.230
off.

31
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.180
That's a good place to get started now.

32
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.790
Finally after the div with class columns the closing element for that are the closing tag is right there.

33
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.950
It's going to find a closing tag for the class columns and after it I'm gonna put in some markup to

34
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.580
show a tutorial of sorts to the user.

35
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.560
It's going to do a div with a class couple of class names here.

36
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.600
So we're gonna have column is Dash half notification notification.

37
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:40.430
There we go is Dash primary and tutorial I'll close off that div and we're gonna show some message to

38
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.020
the user inside of here so they understand how to use our application so I'll do an H one with the class

39
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:54.970
of title and I'll say something like search or a movie on both sides then after that I'll do a paragraph

40
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.170
element with the class of sub title with some text like we will tell you which is best.

41
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.860
Again just to help our user understand what's going on here.

42
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.080
Now two things here please double check your spelling of the word notification very easy to misspell.

43
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.750
In addition overall just do a double check of all the each team all that we just wrote is very easy

44
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.760
to make several typos inside of here.

45
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.710
Make sure you've got columns and then column column and column down there as well.

46
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.330
So I'm gonna save this.

47
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.430
Now we're not going to see any auto completes up here right away because we removed the div with the

48
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.630
class of autocomplete.

49
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.880
So in fact we're probably gonna get a javascript error.

50
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.750
I just want to do a quick refresh and make sure that we see the tutorial on the screen.

51
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.490
That's what I really want to see right now.

52
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.740
I'm gonna go back over in a refresh and yep I definitely see that appear.

53
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.180
So now we can go back and we can start to wire up the two different autocomplete.

54
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.520
So we want to have one that's going to be rendered into right there and the other two right there.

55
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.190
So quick pause we're gonna make sure that we'd render both these auto completes in the next video.
