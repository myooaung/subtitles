00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.380
We've now got our products listing put together which is great.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.650
This really is the central page of our entire administration panel.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.750
Let me tell you why right now whenever a user creates a product signs up signs in and in the future

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.180
edits the product as well.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.490
We're going to want to make sure that we redirect them automatically to the product Index.

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.280
Right now we instead just showed them some text message whenever they sign up sign in or create a product

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.650
showing a user just some simple text like say submitted is not very helpful to a user because it doesn't

8
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.280
really tell them what else they can do in our application.

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.700
So right now a user would have to click on the back button after signing up signing in or creating a

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.060
product not a good experience.

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.380
So in order to get a user over to our product index after they do these different actions we're going

12
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.160
to make sure that we redirect their browser.

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.900
Let me show you how we do that.

14
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.630
Back inside of our admin product Scott J.S. file I'll find our poster.

15
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.070
Quest handler for creating a new product and then right here instead of sending back the plain text

16
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.610
of submitted I'm going to instead say red dot redirect slash admin slash products.

17
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.120
It's now whenever a user makes a post request to this end point rather than sending back that plain

18
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.530
text.

19
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.380
We're going to send back a message to their browser that says hey you just successfully created a product.

20
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.960
Now automatically it change or your l and go over to this new route of admin slash products.

21
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.420
The browser is then going to initiate a new request a get request in this case to go and fetch that

22
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.900
new endpoint or that new route.

23
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.770
So this should cause the user to see the product listing page after they create a new product successfully

24
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:45.190
let's save this and do a quick test so going to go back to admin products slash new I'll enter in some

25
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:53.020
quick title and price and an image and I when I create that product I get redirected back to the products

26
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.040
index much better.

27
00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.060
Let's do that same process of doing a redirect like that on our logon page and these sign up page as

28
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.100
well.

29
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.930
So I'll find routes admin off dot J.S. I'll go down to our poster request handler for dealing with a

30
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.330
successful sign up now rather than sending back the plain text of account created.

31
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:23.750
We'll do a red dot redirect of admin slash products or then go to sign in here's the post your handler

32
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.550
for sign in.

33
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.990
And once again instead of a resort send we'll do a resort redirect for admin slash products let's do

34
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.730
a quick test of sign in and sign up.

35
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.590
Just make sure everything works correctly.

36
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.780
So very quickly I'm going to go to slash sign in an attempt to sign in with a valid account yep that

37
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:54.970
worked and I'll go to slash sign up I'll put in some email to matching passwords.

38
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.440
And there we go as well.

39
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.670
Okay.

40
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.230
So this definitely looks good.

41
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.720
Let's take a quick pause now we've got some better navigation continue in just a minute.
