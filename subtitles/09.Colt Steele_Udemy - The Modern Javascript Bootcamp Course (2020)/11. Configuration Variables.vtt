00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.900
In this video we're going to start to refactor our index not J.S. file and get it ready for a maze.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.690
So we've got some code inside of here right now for that quick little demo.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.260
I'm going to delete a lot of the code related to this demo.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.390
So if you want to you can always make a copy or a backup of the index not just file as it is right now.

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.130
So you still have access to the code for the demo but I don't really need that code anymore so I got

6
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.210
to delete some of the stuff in here related to creating all those different shapes so inside my index

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.730
dot J.S. file first get started by finding where we created that mouse constraint right here.

8
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.590
Remember this is what allowed us to do some click and drag on each of those different shapes our maze

9
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.300
program is not going to have any click and drag functionality.

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.920
So going to delete all that mouse related stuff I'll also go back up to the top and delete the two D

11
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.250
structures we have for the mouse related stuff so mouse constraint and mouse.

12
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.110
Next up I'll go down to the very bottom where we create our random shapes so I don't need any random

13
00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.820
shapes anymore.

14
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.900
It's going to take everything from that comment down to the very bottom and delete it.

15
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.410
All right.

16
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.640
Now the last thing I want to change really quickly when we're refactor we go back up a little bit you'll

17
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.890
notice we've got the height and width right here.

18
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.850
I'm going to change the width to be exactly equal to the height.

19
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.360
So 600 by 600.

20
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.100
The reason for this is that some of the logic around our maze actually ends up being a lot easier to

21
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.760
write if we have a perfectly square maze so as tall as it is wide as soon as we start to get a rectangular

22
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.160
maze some of the math gets just slightly more complicated so we're going to first build a version of

23
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.560
our maze that works perfectly with it being square and we're going to eventually refactor it to be rectangular

24
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.210
in nature as well.

25
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.500
Ultimately we're going to make sure that the maze spans the entire size of this window.

26
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.970
So like from this top left corner down here to the bottom right.

27
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.910
But for the first implementation we're gonna have it fixed as just 600 by 600

28
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.490
now with the 600 by 600.

29
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.020
That means we also have to update the placement of some of our different walls because these walls currently

30
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.070
rely upon a 600 by me at eight hundred by six hundred canvas.

31
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.960
So now we have to go through here and update some these values.

32
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.040
I want you to recall that one of the reasons I said that we would create the height and with various

33
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.240
villas up here is to just have the ability to change these numbers right here and have all the appropriate

34
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.590
variables inside of our file update.

35
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.920
So as we start to rewrite or update some the numbers inside of here rather than using fixed values like

36
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.350
four hundred six hundred eight hundred I'm going to instead have these numbers be references back up

37
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.930
to the height and with variables up the top.

38
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.420
So in other words we're going to have our walls laid themselves out automatically based upon the overall

39
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.280
dimensions of our canvas.

40
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.330
So that means that we will only have to do this one more update and then as we start to change these

41
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.300
numbers later on as we want to test out different shapes of mazes all of our different walls will relay

42
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.070
themselves out appropriately without us messing around with this code at all so we're gonna go through

43
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.290
here and update each of these rectangles.

44
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.580
We're gonna have as you fixed constant numbers as possible so let's get to it.

45
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.770
The first rectangle we created represented the top rectangle.

46
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.400
So that's this one up here at the very top edge.

47
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.350
Remember the first number represents the distance from the top left coordinate to the center of that

48
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.950
rectangle.

49
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.200
So that's essentially the width of our canvas divided by two.

50
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.010
Then the second number or the second argument represents how many units down from that top left corner.

51
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.890
In this case we are zero units down then the third number was the total width of that rectangle which

52
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.050
would be the width of the canvas once again.

53
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.360
And then the height of that rectangle we're going to leave the 40s in here as 40s but we might eventually

54
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.630
extract them to be assigned by a variable as well.

55
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.510
All the other numbers inside of here are going to be either zeros or a can function based upon our height

56
00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.530
and our width so let's do these updates.

57
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.330
So the first one right here again that's going to be our width divided by two because we're going to

58
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.530
go from the top left halfway over to right there.

59
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.210
So that's the entire with divide by two then the second argument will continue to be zero because we're

60
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:21.200
going zero units down the entire width of that rectangle is going to be width and then its height will

61
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.920
just be 40.

62
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.950
Like I said we'll leave that as a constant value inside of here for now the next rectangle is the one

63
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.320
at the bottom of the edge.

64
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.590
So bottom edge of the canvas.

65
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.660
That right there.

66
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.040
So in this case we're going to once again go over width divided by two units but we're going to go down

67
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.050
height units so the entire height of the canvas we're gonna go down the height of the canvas.

68
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:50.340
But once again go over to the right with divided by two and I'll go down height units the width will

69
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.630
once again be width and the height of the thing itself will be 40.

70
00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.730
It's the next one the third rectangle that we created was the left hand wall.

71
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.440
So in this case we are going to the right 0 units.

72
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.650
So essentially staying in the same plane or going down height divided by two that still give me zero

73
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.480
going to have height.

74
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.270
Divide by two

75
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.420
the width of this thing is going to be 40 and the overall height of the shape itself or the height units

76
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.060
in other words the entire height of the canvas then finally we've got the right hand rectangle as well.

77
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.990
So with this one we want to go over the entire width of the canvas.

78
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.530
We want to go down with divided by two we're seeing height divided by two.

79
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.250
That's better and then the entire height of that rectangle will be height so same height as the canvas

80
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.570
itself.

81
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.660
So let's save this going to go back over and refresh and there we go.

82
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.490
So I've now got a square canvas.

83
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.500
The walls are kind of hard to see here just because the color is not that distinct.

84
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.210
So if I wanted to I could disable wire frames mode so I could ask me I can enable wire frames mode so

85
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.100
I can set that to true refresh.

86
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.760
And now those walls are a little bit easier to see.

87
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.760
So as you can guess the benefit to this approach is that we can now change height with as much as we

88
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.060
want.

89
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.070
So for example I could go back to a hundred by six hundred and the walls are going to adjust themselves

90
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.470
automatically I can go to twelve hundred by six hundred.

91
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:26.810
I can go to twelve hundred by I don't know five or about one hundred whatever doesn't matter at the

92
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.460
end of the day the walls are going to lay themselves out appropriately we're going to try to write out

93
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.080
code like this as much as possible because again later on as we decide to mess around us on the different

94
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.420
values inside of here it's gonna be a lot easier to change one number at the top as opposed to messing

95
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.740
with a ton of code as we create all the different shapes so it looks good.

96
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.170
Let's take a pause right here and continue in the next video.
