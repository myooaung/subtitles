00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.780
All right we've established how to update verticals.

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.210
Now it's time to do the same thing for horizontals as well.

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.970
So we're going to once again imagine that we're sitting right here in the middle and we're going to

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.780
go only either up or down.

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.320
So we want to update either that or that right there.

6
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.550
So let's think about the structure of horizontals again

7
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.300
so remember horizontals has some very different dimensions.

8
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:33.830
It's going to be a 2D array but it's going to have only two rows inside of it and three columns because

9
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.590
we are representing one two three and then row two is one two three.

10
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.920
So they all start off as false

11
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.240
so just to be really clear that element right there corresponds with that well that element corresponds

12
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.950
with that wall.

13
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.940
And so on now we think about moving up or down once again we're going to establish that we've got a

14
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.620
starting row of one and a column equal to one and that represents the cell that we are currently in

15
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.830
right here.

16
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.800
So we need to figure out how we can essentially take these values and depending on the direction access

17
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:23.480
and update either that element or that element so once again we can kind of ignore one of these variables

18
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.890
in this case it's column.

19
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.740
So whenever we move up or down column is always going to stay the same so we are going to update the

20
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.440
elements at column equal to whatever the current column is however the row variable is going to change

21
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:47.670
depending upon the direction we are going so if we are going up then row needs to be whatever the current

22
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.080
row is minus one to get that one right there and then if we are going down

23
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.550
then row is going to be whatever the current row is to get this element right there that wall which

24
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.230
is that right there.

25
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:16.200
So in that case it be Roe which is in other words 1 in our case so to get from the center element up

26
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.160
it's going to essentially be either Roe minus 1.

27
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.400
And if we're going down it's going to be whatever the current ROE is.

28
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.970
And then column either way is going to stay the same OK.

29
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.800
So now we understand that.

30
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.320
Let's go back over and write out these.

31
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:36.940
Else if cases as well as well I'll say else if direction is up and we want to look at horizontals in

32
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:47.080
this case we want to look at Roe minus one and the same column and we want to update that to true and

33
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:56.680
then else if direction is down and we'll look at horizontals I'm going to take whatever the current

34
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:05.460
ROE is and the exact same column and I'll set it to true and that's pretty much it okay.

35
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.500
So just like we did before we're going to comment out a couple of the possible different directions

36
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.890
and just do a quick test and make sure that everything is working correctly.

37
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.040
I'm going to comment outright on the first try up right here.

38
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.210
So again if we are going to successfully go up we want to update that element right there which will

39
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:31.870
be at index of row 0 column 1 as I'll save this.

40
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.010
I'm going to go back over to the browser refresh printout horizontals.

41
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.120
Here's my 2 by 3 array and yep I updated the correct value now we can test the same exact thing as well

42
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.080
going down.

43
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:52.010
So a comment out up and on comment down so if we correctly update down we should be updating that one

44
00:03:52.070 --> 00:04:02.890
right there to true to all save refresh do you horizontals again and right there we've updated to true.

45
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.620
Perfect.

46
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.580
Okay.

47
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.510
So that's it.

48
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.520
I know this has probably been pretty nasty but that is the hardest part of understanding this may stuff

49
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.860
is just understanding that depending upon the direction we are going we have to adjust the indices of

50
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.350
what we are of what Wall We are trying to update.

51
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.770
All right.

52
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.610
The last thing I'm going to do here is essentially restore my code to a working state so I'm going to

53
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.920
UN comment all these different directions I'm gonna make sure I get some commas back in there is my

54
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.980
code for format matter add on automatically removed them all then go back down to my step through cell

55
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:45.150
call right here and I'll throw in my start row and my start column okay.

56
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.080
The last thing I have to do is visit that next cell.

57
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.690
We'll take care of that in the next video.
