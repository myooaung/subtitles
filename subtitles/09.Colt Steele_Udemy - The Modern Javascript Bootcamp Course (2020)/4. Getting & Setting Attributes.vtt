00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.900
Next up we'll see two methods not properties but methods called Get attribute and set attribute and

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.220
these methods do exactly what they sound like.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.830
They allow us to access or change the value of attributes on elements.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.340
So we've seen a couple shorthand or shortcut WAYS TO ACCESS attributes some special cases like value

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.850
or place holder or source or a ref that are commonly used have their own shortcut property but there

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.320
are other attributes that don't.

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.020
So we have these methods get attribute and set attribute.

8
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:39.920
For example on this range input right here if I select it concept I also like using a query selector.

9
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.380
So I'll do constraint equals document dot query selector and I don't want to just do input I'm going

10
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:57.650
to do input and then attribute type equals have to use the right quotes in here type equals range and

11
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.470
I'll expand it a bit so give me the first input where it has the type attributes that to range and we

12
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.250
have that range and if we look at it where are you.

13
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.640
Right here we have a bunch of attributes.

14
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.040
We have the type attribute we have men we have Max we have step.

15
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.410
So if I want to know what the max value is for this range I could do range dot and then the get attribute

16
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.580
method which takes the name of an attribute as a string and I'll type Max and I get 500 if I do when

17
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.190
I get one hundred I could also view the type attribute and get range.

18
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.450
So that's get attribute.

19
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.090
It's simple.

20
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.880
You pass in the attribute you're looking for on the element that you're calling it on and it gives you

21
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.280
the value assuming it has that attribute.

22
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.620
If I try and find an attribute that's not in there like L'OrÃ©al it just gives me no.

23
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.350
Now we can also use set attribute so range that set attribute takes two arguments.

24
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.620
The thing we're trying to set so I'll do men and then the value I want to give it.

25
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.870
Let's say the men is negative 500 okay.

26
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.560
Now if we look in our temple or in the elements tab and we inspect that input we should see that now

27
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.830
men is negative five hundred and if we play around with the range let's go all the way down here and

28
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.080
take a look at range that value which we just saw it's now negative three hundred and fifty.

29
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.870
So we are successfully setting that attribute.

30
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.340
It's one that we don't really have a shortcut for.

31
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.030
We have a shortcut for value.

32
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.840
We had one for source on an image and a trap on an anchor tag.

33
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.000
But there are plenty of attributes you may need to change where you need to use set attribute.

34
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.890
So that's a couple of examples.

35
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.470
We also could change the entire type of the input.

36
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:54.870
I could do range that set attribute and then do type and then we could turn it into a radio button.

37
00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.130
Sure type equals radio and now we have a radio button there.

38
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.010
So we completely change the type of the input the variable is still called range but it's no longer

39
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.350
an actual range input.

40
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.590
So that's get attribute and set attribute.

41
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.540
There are plenty of other attributes we could use with this.

42
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.260
Most of the common ones have those shorthand that we saw.

43
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.500
But if there's ever something you need to change.

44
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.980
I mean technically you could use set attribute to change an idea.

45
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.950
So if there's ever an attribute that you need to update or that you need to access these are your go

46
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.880
to methods get and set attribute relatively straightforward.
