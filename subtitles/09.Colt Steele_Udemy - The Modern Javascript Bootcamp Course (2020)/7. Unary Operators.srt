1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,480
In the last video we saw that we could have a variable like score let's say it starts at zero.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,820
We're making some sort of board game or Tetris or something in the browser.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,540
We have a score variable to keep track of the user score and we could updated by doing that score equal

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,160
score plus let's say 10 for user scores 10 points.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,630
Now score is 10.

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:27,330
There's also a shorthand for changing the value of a variable without having to reference the name again.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:34,490
So instead of score equal score plus 10 we can do score plus equals let's go with one.

8
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:41,630
This is the same as saying score equals score plus one plus equals is just going to update score by

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,170
1.

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,580
In this case so score is eleven.

11
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,090
Now we could also do it by something other than one.

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,270
We could add 10 again score plus equals 10 score is now twenty one.

13
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,440
Now we can also do the same thing with subtraction and other operators like score minus equals say that

14
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:06,030
the user did something bad in the game they lose points minus equals one hundred.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,660
Now score is negative seventy nine.

16
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:17,240
Let's reset it to let's go with 150 and then let's say we had another variable like bonus which we called

17
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,890
multiplier.

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,980
That's kind of long about bonus malt instead of multiplier.

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,520
And this will be three.

20
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:31,130
So if we wanted to multiply the score by three year by whatever this multiplier is you get a star in

21
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,480
the game or something that multiplies your score.

22
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,540
We could do score times equals.

23
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:41,590
And then I just want to show you can use other variable names to do this score times equals bonus molt.

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,270
We now are just saying take score and multiply it by whatever this variable is which is three and then

25
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,520
save that new value to score.

26
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,430
We also have divide equals or slash equals most the time you'll see plus and minus.

27
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,130
And a lot of the time you just want to increment by one or decrement by one and there's another shortcut

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,730
an even shorter way of doing that because it's done so commonly.

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,800
Often we're doing things where we have a variable and no need to add one to it and then later add one

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,200
more and one more like a counter for example to keep track of certain things how many times they happen

31
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,480
or how many times you want something to occur and let's do an example of that.

32
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,150
Let's counter.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,860
Equal zero.

34
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,540
If I wanted to add one to it instead of plus equals one there's something called a unitary operator

35
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,300
unitary operators are operators where there's only one side.

36
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,710
This right here has two sides counted plus three.

37
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:37,910
Right.

38
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,280
The left and the right.

39
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,340
This has one side and this is just going to add one plus plus we'll add one to counter.

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:53,050
So now counter it's one and we can do the same thing let's do it one more time or three more times.

41
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,570
Who knows.

42
00:02:53,570 --> 00:03:00,110
So we have counters that to four I can spell it and we can now do the same but decrement ing it counter

43
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,930
minus minus will subtract one.

44
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,460
So counter right now is for right to counter minus minus.

45
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,400
We end up with three cool.

46
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,110
So someone to show you those.

47
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,840
You'll see them all the time plus equals minus equals star equals.

48
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,500
But then also the unitary operators plus plus and minus minus.
