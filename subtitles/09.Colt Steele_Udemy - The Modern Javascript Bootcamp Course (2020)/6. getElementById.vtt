1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.720
All right.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.520
So now that we've seen the document and all of its craziness all the methods and properties that it

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.710
holds inside.

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.850
Obviously we didn't see them all or talk about them all but you saw how many there are.

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.820
We're going to start by taking a look at the first batch of methods that you should know.

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.520
The most important methods that have to do with selecting so selecting is a really important part of

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.800
the DOM manipulation process.

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.850
Typically we select an element or multiple elements and then do something with them.

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.420
So here's a simple example with paint cards or paint chips we select one and then give it a new color

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.380
or do something with it.

11
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.360
We could animated.

12
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.690
We could move it around we could delete it.

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.800
We could select something and then add a new child within it a new element we could select a form and

14
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.780
add two new buttons to it.

15
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.600
We can also do things like add events so we select an element a button.

16
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.570
We did this early on actually two videos three videos ago we selected a button on Google.

17
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.980
And then when you hover over it we alerted some text.

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.920
So when we want to add some events and interactivity we still start by selecting and there's a bunch

19
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.760
of different ways to select using the document.

20
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.340
I'm going to show you a couple the first one we'll tackle.

21
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.540
It's called Get element by I.D..

22
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.410
This is a method on the document.

23
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.960
So we call it as document Dodd get element by I.D. and it does what it sounds like.

24
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.010
It takes an I.D. and it finds the matching element that contains or that has that I.D. on it and it

25
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.700
returns that object.

26
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.880
So if we go back to this simple example we could have any markup but the markup I have to keep it easy

27
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.210
is from a couple videos ago.

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.470
It looks like this.

29
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.830
We have an H1 some paragraphs I've got a well a form and I have an image that has an I.D. bear dash

30
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.820
photo.

31
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.180
Let's add one more I.D. let's do this paragraph here.

32
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.180
I.D. equals text.

33
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.120
Now how about Maine.

34
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.100
Sure.

35
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.760
So I have two ideas on this page.

36
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.900
Now I can select those elements using document dot get element by I.D. So it's a method that exists

37
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.830
on the document and I pass in an I.D. as a string.

38
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.810
So I have bare photo that was one.

39
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.210
I'll try that and you can see what I get back.

40
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.270
It returns an element to me.

41
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.140
What's annoying.

42
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.190
I went over this a couple of videos ago.

43
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.360
It printed out as HDMI out which is not very useful but if we save it to a variable just to make it

44
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.380
easier I'll call this image and then console dot DJI our image.

45
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.550
We can see its true object form as we talked about earlier.

46
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.630
Here are all the properties I have.

47
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.060
So this selects based off of an I.D. but it's not returning to normal to me even though it looks like

48
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:51.070
it is it's returning an object in this object represent that one image with the I.D. And if we scroll

49
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.280
down we will see I.D. is set to bear photo matching this I.D. right there.

50
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.220
We also have properties like the type of the Element tag name is set to image.

51
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.240
We could find the image source right here.

52
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.670
This is the image you are.

53
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.810
So when we call document dot get element by I.D. pass in a string.

54
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.420
If there is a match and only if there is a match for that I.D. we get that element back as an object.

55
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.990
The Dom representation of that element.

56
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.560
This image remember you're only supposed to have one I.D. on a page or one of each I.D. so there shouldn't

57
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.360
be multiple bear photos.

58
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.630
And if there were for some reason we still only get the first one that matches.

59
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.010
So we'll only ever get one element back and if we pass in an invalid I.D. or something that's not on

60
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:47.890
the page let's do document Duckett element I.D. Of get element by I.D. of bear in all caps we get nothing.

61
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.670
So no error.

62
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.050
We just get no because there isn't an element with that I.D. and we'll do one more example.

63
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.130
We have something else with an I.D. this paragraph.

64
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:05.290
The idea is Maine if I select that I.D. using document to get element by I.D. Maine I'll save that to

65
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.320
a variable called P.

66
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.950
We look at P It looks like it's age GMO but remember it's actually an object console that D.A. R P here

67
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.890
is our object and it contains a lot of the similar properties a lot of the same methods as our image

68
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.700
but different values.

69
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.140
For example we scroll down all the way down here.

70
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.140
We don't have a source attribute because it's not an image we have tag name set to P because it's a

71
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:38.830
paragraph it's a p tag we have the text content Lorem Epsom blah blah blah that's the content of this

72
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.870
paragraph and there's a whole bunch of other things.

73
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.890
One other important topic that we'll see a couple of times in this section is that this object here

74
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.530
is of a particular type.

75
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.310
It is something called an HMO paragraph element.

76
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.130
If we look at our image I still have it here.

77
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.900
Let's do a console dot DVR image and we look at what type it is.

78
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.000
We scroll down to the bottom.

79
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.900
It's called an HD him out image element.

80
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.440
So they're both HD hymnal elements but one is an image element.

81
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.130
One is a paragraph element.

82
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.900
Now in this course we haven't talked about prototypes we haven't talked about constructor functions

83
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.950
and classes.

84
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.660
So we won't go into much detail here but all you need to know is that there are different categories

85
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.780
of elements on the page and some of them have their own type like an HMO paragraph element and an H

86
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.700
came out image element every image element has a source.

87
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.160
For example a paragraph doesn't.

88
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.730
These are just different patterns for these objects.

89
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.510
So whenever we get an element by I.D. or any of the other select methods we'll see in the next couple

90
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.950
videos they return some sort of element to us.

91
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.590
It could be an image element it could be a paragraph element it could be something else.

92
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.170
We haven't seen yet and that's kind of it for document does get element by ideas.

93
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.470
So we call it on the document.

94
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:06.230
We pass in some ideas string and if there's a match we get that one element represented as an object.

95
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.930
If there's not a match we get no.
