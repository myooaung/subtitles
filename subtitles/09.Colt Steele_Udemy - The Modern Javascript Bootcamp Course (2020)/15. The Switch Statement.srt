1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,550
Next up I'd like to introduce a different feature of JavaScript.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,420
It has to do with decision making and logic.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,580
It's called the switch statement.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,540
It's not as commonly used as the typical conditional with if else if and else but in certain scenarios

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,330
it's really useful.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,850
So let me show you what it looks like or why you would use it.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,540
Imagine we have a variable with a number representing the day of the week.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,320
So let's go with day equals three.

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:34,740
If I wanted to translate a number going from one to seven to Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:41,170
and so on depending on where you are in the world I think people use different start dates for the week.

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,640
I think outside of the U.S. and Canada it's stuck.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,140
The week starts on Monday which makes a lot more sense than starting it on Sunday like we do in the

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,600
US.

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,190
So let's go with the international version using a standard conditional.

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,880
We would check if day is equal to one and all fast forward through this but we would cancel that log

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:06,260
Sunday or Monday have got a break that American habit or going with international standard.

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,050
And then we would have.

18
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,560
Else if day is to and I'll just type this out quickly.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,690
Okay here we go.

20
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:16,860
It's quite long if day is 1 Monday to Tuesday and it's just a bunch of else ifs.

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,330
If I change the day to 2 we get Tuesday.

22
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,020
If I change the day to 7 we get Sunday.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:33,210
Let's also add in a fallback so if you didn't enter a number from 1 to 7 we'll consider that log invalid

24
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,400
day.

25
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,230
All right.

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:43,190
So this is fine but it's a lot of work and each time we're really just checking day against one value.

27
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,080
Over and over and over until we find a match or until we don't find a match in the else runs we can

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,450
use a switch statement in a scenario like this where we're taking one value and we're just checking

29
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,120
it against multiple potential values.

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,860
So the syntax for switch is quite a bit different.

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,750
It looks like this switch and then the thing that we are checking.

32
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,970
So for us it would be day then we have our curly braces and then we have a bunch of cases so we would

33
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:20,150
have Case 1 meaning if day is 1 and inside of that we don't actually have to use curly braces.

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:29,820
We can cancel that log Monday and then we could have case to cancel that log Tuesday and let's just

35
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,630
start with that.

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:39,200
So let's make a day to refresh the page and we get Tuesday Tuesday as you can see here.

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,910
So I will flesh this out with the other days.

38
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,580
There we go.

39
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,870
So we have seven different cases.

40
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,520
One day is one do this day is to do this.

41
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,660
3 and so on.

42
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,990
I'll comment out the traditional conditional that we have appear there's a problem with our switch at

43
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,020
the moment and you'll see it day is set to two.

44
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,620
Let's see what we get when I refresh the page.

45
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,680
Oh jeez.

46
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,040
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday.

47
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,890
We got everything except Monday.

48
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,780
What if we change day to be for refresh the page.

49
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,020
Now we get Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday.

50
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,690
So that's kind of odd.

51
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,880
It's giving us every value after it matches.

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:29,610
So if case is for it does this it does this does this and this if cases one it does all of them is k.

53
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:35,240
If case is 6 or if day is 6 we do this one and this one.

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,910
So the reason this happens it's kind of annoying but what's happening here is that as soon as one of

55
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,890
them matches in our case for so Day is 4.

56
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,190
This is true.

57
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:54,170
None of these other cases are tested and it's almost like it turns into this all of that code runs without

58
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,680
checking for a case.

59
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:01,490
So it's looking for the first match and then as soon as it finds it everything else runs.

60
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,500
And that seems like an odd choice.

61
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,630
We'll talk about why that happens in a moment.

62
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:12,410
The way to fix this if you only want one of these to run is to add a break after each statement after

63
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,470
each case.

64
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:20,120
So I'll make multiple cursors by holding option and clicking and then add break after each one.

65
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,970
Now if I refresh I only get the correct day.

66
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,990
So if day is 7 I only get Sunday.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,570
If day is 1 I should only get Monday.

68
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:37,410
We still don't have our fallback so if we have something like 9 we had that else earlier.

69
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,200
We don't have an else the way we write the equivalent instead of.

70
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,030
Else we write default and default will run at the end.

71
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:55,310
So we would have invalid day and now we get invalid day if we have 7.

72
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,030
We get Sunday and it all works OK.

73
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,950
So this is odd but this is still much easier to read.

74
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,710
It's a lot of lines but it's much easier to read in my opinion than this.

75
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,820
We don't have to do all of these poor and the curly braces.

76
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,390
We don't have to check with triple equals over and over and over.

77
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,050
You can just look at this and pretty quickly understand what's going on.

78
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,310
If Day is one do this.

79
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,890
If Day is for do this as long as we have those breaks in there why do we have those breaks going to

80
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,480
show you another example.

81
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,610
I'll comment this out for a moment.

82
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,380
So here's a second example.

83
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,960
We are taking in a movie it's just a text description of an emotion like happy face and printing out

84
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,140
the corresponding color or the main color.

85
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,090
So happy faces yellow sad faces.

86
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,830
Yellow eggplant is Purple Heart is red.

87
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,080
And lips are also red.

88
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,860
So right now they're all going to run well everything after we find a match.

89
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,670
So a happy face gives us yellow yellow purple red red.

90
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,360
But if we add in our breaks as we've seen that fixes the problem.

91
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,640
But we do have some duplicated console logs.

92
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,110
We have multiple things that are red and we have multiple that are yellow.

93
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:10,820
We could rewrite this because of the way switch statements work because of how they're structured.

94
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,890
We can combine certain cases and the way we do it looks like this.

95
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,300
Let's do happy face and sad face.

96
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,180
I'm just going to delete this entire thing here input case.

97
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,410
Sad face right here.

98
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,220
Case sad face right above.

99
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,640
Happy Face and I don't have any code coming after it.

100
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,290
So what happens here is that sad face could be a match.

101
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,870
Let's say it is.

102
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,910
This is true.

103
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,720
There is no break right here.

104
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:48,520
And because there's no break it moves on and it runs this code and then it hits a break so we can do

105
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,280
the same thing for heart and lips will do.

106
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,140
Case lips and then we can remove what we had down below.

107
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:03,700
Right here so same thing if a emoji is heart.

108
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,740
This is not true.

109
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,080
Not.

110
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,790
Nope.

111
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,170
This is true.

112
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,420
And then there's no code to run but there wasn't a break.

113
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,440
So then it just runs this code as we saw.

114
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,080
If you don't use a break after one of these cases it's going to just run all the code that it sees.

115
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,110
So at this point let's try it out.

116
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:27,010
We get yellow for sad face let's do lips we get red if do heart.

117
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,930
We should also get red.

118
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,230
We don't have a default on this one and that's fine.

119
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,290
Sometimes you don't.

120
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:38,460
So that's pretty much it for switches the syntax is definitely a little different but if you have one

121
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:45,060
variable one thing that you are checking against multiple values like we're doing here it's a nice and

122
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,960
easy to understand way of writing that logic compared to doing a ton of else ifs.

123
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,680
There's just a couple gotchas as you saw you need to make sure there's really just one.

124
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,250
You have to use break when it makes sense.

125
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,350
Sometimes it doesn't.

126
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:04,590
If you're trying to have multiple cases that correspond to the same piece of code anyway that switch.
