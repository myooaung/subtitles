1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,770
We just created our package such a sum file and added in that in Section.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,230
So now we are saying essentially right here that we want to build to run the command and L S at our

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:15,620
terminal and run the index not just file as though it were some kind of executable creating this package

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,630
that Jason File and adding in that section is just step one and being able to run our project from anywhere

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,530
on our machine.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,360
There's a couple of more steps we have to do these other steps a little bit esoteric or kind of mysterious.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,730
So I want to very quickly show you a diagram to walk you through each of them okay.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,450
So we just create the Pakistan Jason File with that bean section.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,850
The next day we're going to do is change the permissions of the index not J.S. file.

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,830
This is going to allow us to run that file as though it were an actual executable.

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,370
You should not have to do this next step if you are on a Windows machine.

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,690
And in fact if you try to run the command we're about to run on a Windows machine you're probably going

13
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,500
to end up seeing an error that does not apply.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,400
Of course if you are using Windows subsystem for Linux.

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:00:59,960
All right.

16
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:05,280
So to update the permissions I can go back over to my terminal find my list directory and I'll run it

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,430
see h mod plus X index dot J Yes and that's it.

18
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,350
That will now give us permission to run that file as though it were an executable and the next two we

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,170
have to do is open up the index not just file.

20
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,480
We're going to add a little comment at the very top that's going to allow us to run it like an executable.

21
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,900
So like something we can double click to execute directly without having to involve node at all to do

22
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:38,240
so I'm going to go back over to my editor open up the index dot ust file and at the very top I'm going

23
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:49,500
to put in a Hash character then an exclamation then slash U.S. are not user just USAR slash local or

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:58,590
C meet slash been slash EMV and then a space and Node like so this is essentially telling our computer

25
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:06,510
that we want to use node to execute this file as opposed to trying to execute this file directly.

26
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,130
All right.

27
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,590
It's now the very last thing we have to do is go back over to our terminal and we're going to do something

28
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,950
called linking our project.

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,290
So I'm going to go to my terminal once and get again inside the list directory and inside of here I'm

30
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,870
going to run NPM link.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,850
This is essentially going to take our current project and make it available to everywhere or every directory

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,140
on our machine.

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,870
So it essentially going to take our project make it globally available everywhere else.

34
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:42,560
So I'll run that and we'll see some little printout like this right here and we're ready to go.

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,090
Now we should go to run an L S and see the output from our program.

36
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,380
Now we can change to any directory on our machine so I can go back to my very root directory on my machine

37
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,140
or run into less and I'll see all the files inside they're printed out and I can repeat that process

38
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,820
from anywhere else just running an L S directly so that's pretty much it.

39
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,010
That's how we can set up a no J ust project to be executed from anywhere.

40
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,820
Now as you would guess this is really only used for useful for kind of command line interface tools

41
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,720
or CLIA that we're putting together for ourselves or other engineers.

42
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,700
Nonetheless it is a nice little trick to have in the back pocket.

43
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:21,970
All right.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,520
So our project definitely works.

45
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,560
But the last thing on I mentioned here is that the L S command like the normal one whenever we run it

46
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,420
we get this kind of nice color printout of all the different files and whatnot inside of our project

47
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:40,320
directory whereas our program is just doing this really ugly console log of an array.

48
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:45,010
So I would like to add in a couple little improvements to our program now and just make the output or

49
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,310
the console log a little bit more interesting.

50
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,850
And as we do so we're going to very quickly see that there's a couple other challenges for us to tackle

51
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,230
inside of our program.

52
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,870
So quick pause and we'll start that in the next video.
