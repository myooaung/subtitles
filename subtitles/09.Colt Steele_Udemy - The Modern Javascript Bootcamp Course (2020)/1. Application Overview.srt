00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,830
In this video we're going to start a new little project that's going to be focused around helping you

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,080
share secret messages with friends.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,810
So let's take a look at a couple of mockups and understand what we're trying to build.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,370
All right here we go.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,310
So when a user first comes to our little web application we're gonna show them a text input on the screen

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,960
and prompt them to enter a secret message.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,620
So this right here is a text input.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,940
So I would imagine that I would type in something like my secret message or whatever else.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,760
Well then click on that create button when we click on the create button the entire form is going to

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,870
change.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,250
So we're going to swap out the form right there and show some different content.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,470
Instead we're gonna show a new text input and inside there we're gonna show a U or L that a user can

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:49,810
share with a user or with one of their friends if anyone else goes to this very special little you U.R.L.

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,000
that we show right here.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,000
We're going to show them a screen like this so essentially we're going to somehow figure out what the

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,760
secret message is and displayed on the screen when some other user or like a friend comes to the screen.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,110
We're going to also show a little link at the bottom that says create your own message.

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,270
And if a user clicks on that they're going to go back to this initial page over here.

19
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,030
So again we enter some text.

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,360
We click on Create.

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,020
We get a link to be shared with a friend.

22
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:22,430
If a friend visits this link we're going to show them the original secret message.

23
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,490
Now you might could be kind of curious how this is all going to work.

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,940
Well look really closely at this are all right here.

25
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,330
So we're going to have a link to our application and all the very end.

26
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,250
We're going to have this kind of cryptic looking string so inside of that little cryptic string we're

27
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,830
going to essentially encode or secretly hide whatever the message is.

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,900
So that string right there we can imagine is going to represent somehow magically my secret message

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,130
so whenever a user clicks on that link inside the URL or in other words in the address bar we're going

30
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,090
to have access to that message inside of the friend's browser.

31
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,710
Now if all this doesn't really quite make sense just yet.

32
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,720
That's totally fine.

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,560
As we start to build the application you're going to very quickly understand how this is all put together.

34
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,550
So this is going to be a fun little app.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,470
We're going to understand a lot more about handling navigation inside the browser.

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,660
So let's take a pause right here.

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,890
We'll come back the next video and start doing a little bit of project setup.
