00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,810
At the end of the last video I mentioned how he's got some hard coded values inside of here of threes

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,780
and twos.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,690
So the values that we currently have inside of here work perfectly for a three by three maze.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,350
Okay I've really drawn the heck out of this thing but you get the idea.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,580
It only works for a three by three mates.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,930
So if we ever wanted to have some different dimensions for our maze Well we would have to go back through

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,280
and start to update all these different values by hand and I can just about guarantee you that we would

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,490
make a typo somewhere and end up breaking our code.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,880
So I think that we should abstract out these different numbers into a configuration variable.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:39,180
So I got to go back up to the very top of the file and I going to create a new variable that I'll call

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,580
cells I can start this off as three.

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:49,120
Now the values cells right here is talking about either the number of cells in the horizontal edge or

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,870
the vertical edge.

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,690
So for right now we're going to imagine the variable cells is talking about the number of cells either

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,310
that way or that way because all of our mazes right now we're going to be square.

16
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,020
It doesn't really matter which dimension we're talking about.

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,790
Again we are going to eventually allow the creation of mazes that are not square.

18
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,940
So like a three by five.

19
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,070
But right now everything we create will be square.

20
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:18,040
So calling that variable cells right now is more or less okay but another engineer if they looked at

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,130
this they might think that this is the total number of cells that we have.

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,690
So the name isn't the best thing in the world.

23
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,150
Whatever we are going to change that and just a little bit as soon as we add support for rectangular

24
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:35,510
mazes so now we can use that variable to go back down and replace all the hard code numbers we have

25
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,040
inside of here.

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,240
So for example I can find three.

27
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:50,140
Change it to cells change two cells cells and cells and the two values of two.

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:56,760
Well as you might guess those are just going to be cells minus one.

29
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:03,230
Now you should not have any values of two or three inside of here at all one good thing to test right

30
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,260
now would be to try to change the value of cells and then console log out our grid verticals and horizontals

31
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,950
and just to make sure they still make sense.

32
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:19,280
I'm going to try to increase the value of cells to five instead I'll then go back down I'm gonna change

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,200
the console log to take a look at the grid so when I now console log the grid I would expect to see

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,770
a grid of five by five so five inner arrays each of which have five elements inside them if I go back

35
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,670
and refresh yep there is a five by five without a doubt I can also do the same thing for verticals and

36
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:49,230
refresh yep that definitely looks correct and I can do the same thing with horizontals and I've got

37
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,240
a four by five also looks correct now if you want to this is a good spot to pull out your pen and paper

38
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,820
and draw out what a five by five maze would actually look like and then just make sure that we actually

39
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:06,510
do have the correct dimensions on the verticals and the horizontals arrays so I'm not going to flip

40
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,070
back over and mangle my diagram anymore I'll let you do that just in case you want to double check those

41
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,660
values but okay I think overall this is looking good.

42
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:20,080
So now we can start to write in some code after these arrays right here where we're going to essentially

43
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,270
walk through that grid pick those random cells and figure out exactly how we're going to remove all

44
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,340
those walls from the verticals in horizontals arrays two quick pauses we'll start that up in the next

45
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,670
video.
