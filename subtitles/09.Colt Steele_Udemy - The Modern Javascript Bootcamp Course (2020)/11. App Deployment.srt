1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,700
Well our applications all finished up but it's kind of boring only being able to use it on our local

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,510
machine.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,920
So in this video we're going to figure out how we can deploy this application to the open Internet.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,790
We're going to deploy it using a free service called now so we're gonna go over to our terminal and

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,200
let's figure out how to do this.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,270
Once at my terminal I'm going to navigate to my project directory.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,400
I'm going to run the command NPCs now.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,470
Now if you try to run this command and you see an error message.

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,630
Chances are you do not have no J.S. installed on your local machine.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,230
There is another video inside of this course that will tell you how to install know J.S. to go and find

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:36,810
that video.

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,870
Walk through the installation process then come back here and try to run this command again so I can

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,340
run it right now.

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,330
And after a brief pause I'll be asked to log in.

15
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,560
We have to enter a valid email here.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,260
This is going to send us a confirmation email that's going to allow us to deploy our application.

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:00,410
So I to put in my email and then after a brief pause I'm going to check my email and I should get an

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,780
email that tells me how to log into this account.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,440
It's going to look something like this right here.

20
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,300
I'm going to pull up this e-mail.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,610
I'm going to click on verify and then after a quick pause I'm told OK.

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,200
Everything is good to go so this service is then going to log me in and I'm going to once again run

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,040
MP.

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,290
Now once I do it's going to take a look at the different project files inside of my current working

25
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,190
directory.

26
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:32,800
It's then going to bundle all those different files up and send them over to the now service that's

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,560
going to make my application publicly available at the address that I get printed out right here.

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,090
So I can then take that address.

29
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,620
Go back over to my browser and paste it into a new tab.

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,050
And just like magic I'll see my deployed application.

31
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,520
So this is a link that you can actually share with your friends and they can see your app deployed.

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,790
Create messages and share messages as well.

33
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:02,070
So I'm gonna put in here my application is deployed I get my link and notice how we're getting the proper

34
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,510
link for our deployed application.

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,570
Copy that.

36
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,230
Open up another new browser tab visit that link and I'll see my application is deployed and then I can

37
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,330
once again hit create my own secret message to go back to create a message of my own.

38
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:18,660
Okay.

39
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,410
That's pretty much it.

40
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,210
Pretty straightforward deployment process.

41
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,730
Using the app now service is about as easy as it possibly gets.

42
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,360
So now that we've got this publicly available feel free to share with your friends and create your own

43
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,900
secret messages.

44
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,630
That's pretty much it for this application.

45
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,950
So let's pause here and continue on our next app in just a moment.
