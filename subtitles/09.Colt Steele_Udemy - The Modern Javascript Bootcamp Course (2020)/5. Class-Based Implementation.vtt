00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.300
In the last video we started to discuss some architecture inside of application and we eventually settled

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.950
on saying that rather than having a block of code that alternates responsibility of just about every

3
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.900
line we're going to instead try to create one solid block that is 100 per cent concerned around the

4
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.390
timer and then that block of code will eventually emit some events or call a callback or otherwise tell

5
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.490
the outside world that something important just occurred.

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.880
So in this video we're going to start to focus on how we're going to actually implement this thing.

7
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.620
How are we going to write out some code that actually does what you see right here.

8
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.480
Well to implement this we're going to try to use a javascript class.

9
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.410
We do not have to use a class to implement something like this but I think that we're going to write

10
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.180
out the code and you're going to agree with me that using a class for this timer is a really good use

11
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.760
case.

12
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.490
So we're going to get a good idea of how to use a class around DOM elements and how to actually do it

13
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.390
effectively.

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.160
So I sat down and thought up of a couple of different ways to design this Timer class.

15
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.430
I'm going to share with you one way that seems kind of good to me.

16
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.000
So this is the way that we're going to implement our timer so we're going to make a class called timer

17
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.240
and this class is 100 percent concerned with these elements right here the numbers the play button and

18
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.080
the pause button class timer is not going to know anything about that animated border around the timer.

19
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:24.510
Instead class timer just knows about those three things right inside the border so on class timer we're

20
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.870
going to have a couple of different methods these different methods are going to be invoked automatically

21
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.860
whenever a user interacts with the timer elements.

22
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.450
So like the numbers that and the two buttons.

23
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.770
So whenever a user clicks on the play button we're going to call these start method.

24
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.050
And so as you'd guess calling the start method is going to start up some internal timer or something

25
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.550
like that whenever user clicks on the pause button.

26
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.330
We're going to run the pause method remember that in order to change the timer right here a user can

27
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.330
click on that thing and whenever they do it's going to turn into a text input.

28
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.400
And so we're going to say that whenever user changes that text right there are changes the duration

29
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.130
the timer we will call a method called on duration change.

30
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.660
That's a sign that hey the user just changed the duration of the timer.

31
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.060
And then finally we might also have a method on here called something like tick and tick is essentially

32
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.640
going to do what we said these steps were right here.

33
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.500
So essentially every single second or so or like half a second or something we're going to need to run

34
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.020
some code to update these State of the timer.

35
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.300
So like change the actual number on there and all that kind of good stuff.

36
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.360
And so that will be done inside of a tick method so tick is going to be called repeatedly over time

37
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.190
as long as the timer is counting down.

38
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.730
So this is the general idea we're gonna have a class and certain things we click on or interact with

39
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.660
are going to invoke different methods.

40
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.750
Now of course at some point in time we're going to have to make sure that we set up some event listeners

41
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.000
and say OK whenever we click on that play button right there we want to run the start method.

42
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.450
So to set up these event listeners we're going to say that our class timer is going to have a constructor

43
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.500
function.

44
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.090
Remember what a constructor function is.

45
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.250
It's a very special function that gets called immediately whenever we create a new instance of a class

46
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.460
so we're going to say that whenever we create a class timer or an instance of timer we're going to pass

47
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:22.030
in a reference to some dumb element that's going to serve as that little text input right there as the

48
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.150
second argument will pass in some DOM element that will serve as the start button.

49
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.520
And finally it will pass in a third argument that's going to represent the pause button as well and

50
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.280
when I say duration input start button and pause button right there.

51
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.410
All I'm saying is we're going to write a query selector.

52
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.530
We're going to find the text and put the two play buttons and we're gonna pass those into the constructor

53
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.750
so that our class essentially has a handle into the Dom and whenever it needs to reach into the Dom

54
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.810
and do something it will have these variables close at hand OK.

55
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.650
Now once again I just want to mention that if this stuff seems all that confusing right now that is

56
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.600
totally fine.

57
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.430
This is really your first taste of seeing how to effectively use a class around DOM elements.

58
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.650
So the first time you see this it always looks a bit crazy it always looks challenging but I guarantee

59
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.210
you as soon as we start to write some code out you're going to get a really good idea of what is going

60
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.360
on.

61
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.680
OK.

62
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.040
So let's take a pause right here.

63
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.120
We're going to come back the next video and start to implement class timer.
