00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.950
All right now we've got all these statistics.

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.960
Let's make sure that we add each of them to the appropriate article elements inside of our template.

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.580
So down here I have my first article right there that is meant to show the number of awards.

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.190
So on that article element I'm going to add in a data value property.

5
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.510
And I'm going to inject the value awards to it and we can repeat that same process for the other articles

6
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.610
as well.

7
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.060
The next one is supposed to show.

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.150
Box office.

9
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.310
I think we called the relevant statistic dollars.

10
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.460
Yeah.

11
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.220
There it is right there.

12
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.630
So I'm going to go back down there is the box office statistic on the article I'll do a data value of

13
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:53.040
dollars the next one is a data value of medal score then we've got our I'm D rating the data dash value

14
00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:04.890
of i am D.B. rating and finally data dash value I am D.B. boats and that's to be it.

15
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.220
As usual we'll do a quick save and a test to the test in this case is to inspect our DOM elements and

16
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.880
just make sure that we are assigning some reasonable values to each one.

17
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.370
So I will refresh I'll look up Avengers what I actually type dollar instead of dollars my mistake.

18
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.090
There we go.

19
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.990
Dollars on the second one

20
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.170
Avengers again like it.

21
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.080
That's better.

22
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.040
So now I can inspect my Dom I'm going to look at each of these elements and just make sure that they

23
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.940
have the appropriate value property and there we go.

24
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.630
So I can see the list of articles.

25
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.630
There's the first one it has a data value of 118 and I've got the number value for the dollars.

26
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.240
Then the Mets score.

27
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.210
I'm DB rating.

28
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.380
And finally the number of votes says pretty much it.

29
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.280
We can now repeat that same process for this stuff on the right hand side as well.

30
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.280
So over here I'll look up Dark Knight I'll do an inspect of that element right there and I get three

31
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.840
hundred and nine awards.

32
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.000
Wow.

33
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.260
That's pretty crazy.

34
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.660
And I get the best five hundred thirty three million then eighty four Mets score and nine I'm TV rating

35
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.690
and finally two million votes OK.

36
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.070
So that's it.

37
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.910
Now the very last thing we have to do inside of our compare can run comparison function right here.

38
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.190
We can now iterate over all those different article elements.

39
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.370
It's going to iterate over both them at the same time.

40
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.620
They basically get this collection on the left hand side.

41
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.860
And this collection on the right hand side.

42
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.240
And then we'll compare each of them one by one by looking at their data dash value properties whichever

43
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.890
one is greater.

44
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.170
We're going to apply some classes to two colored as yellow.

45
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.230
Otherwise we'll leave it as is and just leave it green.

46
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.180
That's the idea.

47
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.070
One more quick pause.

48
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.760
We're going to wrap this thing up in the next video.
