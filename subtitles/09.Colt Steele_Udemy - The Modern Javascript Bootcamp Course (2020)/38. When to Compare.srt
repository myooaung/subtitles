1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,470
Last thing we have to do is make sure that we get a comparison going between all these different stats.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,990
So back inside of my index dot J.S. file.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,400
I'm going to find where we were just working on on maybe select.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,180
We're going to eventually do a request inside of here.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,200
Remember to get some follow up details about a particular movie.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,000
Now one thing we should probably do inside of here is get a reference or store a reference to that response

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,680
that comes back so we can hold on to that reference that movie and all those different statistics so

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,160
we can do an easy comparison later on to right above on maybe select.

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,220
I'm going to define it two variables with the let keyword.

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:44,080
So I'll say let left movie and write movie then inside this function after we get some data back from

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,870
axioms let's make sure that we store the movie that we just fetched on the appropriate variable to do

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,170
so.

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,150
We're going to need to make sure that we pass in some additional argument here to indicate whether we

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,050
are receiving the movie on the left side or the right side.

15
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:05,530
So inside of both the functions where we call on movie select I'm going to pass in one last variable

16
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,520
here of left as a string and right as a string.

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,950
So now we know the context in which on movie select is being called inside of you're going to receive

18
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:25,000
that as a variable that also calls simply side and then right after we set that inner HMO we can say

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,200
something like If side equals left then let's update the left movie variable.

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,270
So I'll say left movie is response start data.

21
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,590
Else we must be working with the right side.

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,400
So I'll say right.

23
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:43,390
Movie is response not data.

24
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,700
Then after we update both those variables we should add in a check to see if both the left movie and

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,310
right movie are defined.

26
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,640
If both these variables are defined that means we have movie on both sides of the screen and it's time

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:04,950
to run the comparison so after those if else statements I'll say if it's left movie and rights movie

28
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,630
then let's run the comparison.

29
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,970
I'm going to stick all the code for doing the comparison into a helper function called appropriately

30
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:17,330
named run comparison and I'll define that as a helper function.

31
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,200
Right after

32
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,710
then inside of here we can iterate through are two different movies run all the comparisons and an update

33
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:32,230
the appropriate statistics on both sides of the screen so inside of here you're going to do a quick

34
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,180
console log for right now and say time for comparison just to make sure that we are running this code

35
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,820
at the appropriate time.

36
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:48,940
I'll then go back over refresh get that console open and then I'll do Avengers Rigo and Dark Knight

37
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,070
and after I click this movie it would then be in theory time to run the comparison.

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,840
So I'd expect to see the console lug appear at that time.

39
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,400
So click there and I do in fact see time for comparison.

40
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,110
So looks like we're off to a good start.

41
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,720
It's now another quick pause we'll come back the next video and figure out how we're going to actually

42
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,460
compare all these different statistics.
