1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,930
Our app is now all complete.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,760
So let's do a very quick wrap up.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,670
I just want to touch on some really high points inside this project.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,230
We just put together some of the high points were that we created a package that Jace on file inside

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,410
there.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,620
We added a bean section and this defined a commands that we wanted to be able to run on our local machine

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,430
in order to execute the code inside the index not just file.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,610
This is not normally required for a typical node project.

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,680
We only have to add this in if we specifically want to run our program from the command line using some

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,800
special commands like an illness or something like that.

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,360
Otherwise for a typical node project we will instead run it directly from our command line by using

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,910
node and then the name of the file that we want to execute the next thing we learned about was the package

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,490
not Jason.

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,480
In general it is used to configure a project.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,960
The most important parts for a typical project are these script section which we haven't really touched

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,470
on yet.

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:59,290
And the dependency section which records all the different packages that our project relies upon when

18
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,390
we ran that npm install command the package that Jason on file was automatically updated.

19
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,800
And this dependency c section was automatically added in in addition when we installed this outside

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,260
package was installed into the node modules directory inside of our current working folder the next

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,930
big thing inside this project was to understand some of these different standard library modules that

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,770
we made use of.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,440
So like F S you till and path we're going to make use of that F S module anytime we want to work with

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,130
our local file system.

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,310
The other big thing we learned about these different modules is that they expose a lot of different

26
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,130
functions and the vast majority of them always follow the same format we pass in some number of arguments

27
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,350
and then the last argument will be a callback function and that callback function is always going to

28
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:53,170
be called with the same order of arguments so we'll be some kind of error object if one occurred and

29
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,170
then the name or the actual data that we were looking for in this case.

30
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,570
So then inside that callback function we'll do some kind of check to see if there is an error and if

31
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,480
there was we'll handle it in some fashion.

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,310
Otherwise we'll continue on and use the data that we were actually looking for only the last big thing

33
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,380
we learned about was that we can take these different functions that rely upon callbacks and either

34
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:23,300
wrap them in a promise manually as we saw done here with method 1 or by using the promise of fi function

35
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:30,860
as we saw its method to or in some cases we can make use of a sub module and get access to a promise

36
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,650
based version of a given function directly.

37
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,390
This is not always available right here.

38
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:41,180
So sometimes we are going to have to fall back to method 2 or method 1 Okay.

39
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,990
So that's pretty much it for this project.

40
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,790
That's really the only big highlight items that I really want you to understand at this point everything

41
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,020
else so we might have discussed.

42
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,510
Well those are some topics that are going to be coming up again and again specifically some of the ideas

43
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,520
around how we actually handled data inside of here using callbacks versus promises versus promise not

44
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,680
all that stuff that we're going to get a lot of practice with over time.

45
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,960
And so I don't really expect you to be a total master with that stuff just yet.

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,210
All right.

47
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,240
Let's take a pause right here.

48
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,070
We'll come back in just a moment and start working on our next project.
