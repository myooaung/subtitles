1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,670
All right now that we can decode that your well let's add in some H CML to show this a card right here

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,090
that's going to eventually have the secret message inside of it.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,380
So once again back inside my index dot each single file.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:18,300
I'm gonna find the div with class C O L right there short for column and right after it I'm gonna add

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:28,220
in another div I'm gonna give this one an I.D. of message about message dash show just kind of stick

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:34,740
with the conventionally have with these other divs well then give it a class of card dash panel and

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,610
a class of hide so by default this div is going to be completely hidden and we're not gonna show it

8
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:46,070
to the user and inside of here I'm gonna place in each one element each one is going to start off as

9
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,650
empty once we decode the message we're going to select this each one element and put the message inside

10
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,200
there.

11
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,390
So this is kind of a placeholder where we're we were going to eventually show a message to the user

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:03,290
then after that I'm gonna add in a div with an anchor element.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,490
This is going to be a link that the user can use to create their own custom message.

14
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:15,130
So I'm gonna give this thing in a strip of dot slash index dot each female email and then inside the

15
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,690
anchor element I'll say create your own secret message.

16
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,460
So whenever a user clicks on this anchor element we're going to essentially reload the entire index

17
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,030
each female page or the entire document.

18
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,290
And that's going to take out the URL or some to take the hash out of the URL.

19
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,510
All right.

20
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,520
So now back inside of our index dot J File it we're gonna add in some code to check to see if we have

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,160
a message in the URL if we do we're going to remove the hide class from this div we're going to add

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,130
it to this div which is usually shown by default and then we will decode the message and stick it into

23
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,960
that H1 element.

24
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,060
So back over here.

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,840
I'm going to take off the console log function but keep in the code that was inside of it.

26
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,320
Do make sure that you fix up the number of parentheses at the very end as well.

27
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:10,270
I'll then assign this to a variable that I'll call message then we'll say if there is a message let's

28
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,640
toggle the visibility of those two different Divs.

29
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,850
So we need to select this div and add the height class and select that div and remove the hide class

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,100
so I'll do document query selector.

31
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:35,560
Well first do message dash form we'll do a class list and we'll add the high class and I'll do a second

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,000
document query selector in this case I'm going to find the idea.

33
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:52,850
Message dash show I'll look at the class list and then I will remove the hide then finally we can select

34
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,830
that each one element and stick our message inside of it.

35
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:04,460
So I'll do a document very selector each one in our HCM CML and I'll set the message inside of it.

36
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:13,880
Like so it's I think ready for a test so I'll save this go back over I'm going to go to the index start

37
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,900
each team I'll file directly I'm gonna make sure I remove the hash out the or else they're going to

38
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:27,740
test the entire flow here I'll then put in my secret message create a copy that I'm going to put it

39
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:34,130
into a new browser tab just to make sure I can assimilate passing this link off to someone else it enter

40
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:40,890
and I see my secret message appear I should then be able to click on Create your own secret message

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,950
and be taken back to this form and I don't have any hash inside the URL so it looks like we got it now

42
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,450
there's just one awkward thing here.

43
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,800
You'll notice that there's a lot of extra spacing above the H1 element that's because it's each one

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,820
element by default get some margin on the top of it.

45
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,900
So if I hover over it I can see that kind of orange section right above.

46
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,230
Again that just means by default and each one has the margin on top it's going to add in just a little

47
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:12,900
bit more of CSX to remove that margin on the top back inside my index dot each email file I'm going

48
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:19,620
to find where we have the row class and right underneath it I'll put in each one with a margin dash

49
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:29,730
top of zero so save that and one last test here I will refresh and that looks way more reasonable okay.

50
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,350
So I'd say this looks pretty good.

51
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,330
It's now the last thing we really have to figure out is how we can effectively actually share this application

52
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:42,510
with other users right now this link like we said earlier can only be shared with you on your own computer

53
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,730
because that is where the index not a single file lives.

54
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,870
So if you are just sharing messages with yourself.

55
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,890
Well that's not super fun so let's figure out some way to actually make this available to other people

56
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,050
which will definitely be a little bit more interesting.
