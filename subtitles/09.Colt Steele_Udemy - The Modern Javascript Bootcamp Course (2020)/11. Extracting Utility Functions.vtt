00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.530
Our divisions function is all done.

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.030
But there was one last very quick thing I want to do with it.

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:05.860
Our index.

4
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.510
J ust file is already getting a pretty good amount of code inside of it.

5
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.840
Right now we're at just 29 the lines of code and we've barely really begun to start our application.

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.680
So I think that we could be well served to move this D bounce function out into a separate file inside

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.000
my root project directory.

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.550
I'm gonna make a new file called utilize dot J Yes.

9
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.160
The idea behind this file is that I'm going to place any utility functions that I create inside of here.

10
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.110
So this is just so I can better organize the code inside of my project.

11
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.740
I'm going to go find the DB function.

12
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.390
I'm going to cut it.

13
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.410
Move it over to tells dot J.S. and paste it then need to make sure that I include the utilize dot J

14
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.570
as file inside my HDMI document.

15
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.620
So I gonna open up the HDMI document.

16
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.890
I'm going to go down to the very bottom the file I'll find the existing script tag for index dot J.S.

17
00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.000
not going to copy it and paste it right underneath itself I'll then find the first script tag and change

18
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.140
the source to utilize dot J.S..

19
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.160
So now whenever we load up this e-mail document I'm going to first load up and execute all the code

20
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.740
inside of utilized HHS J.S. that will define the DB bounce function will then load up and execute index

21
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.190
dot J.S. which has a reference to DB outs.

22
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.710
So we need to make sure that we define utilize first or include that file first so that we can define

23
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.020
the DB bounce function before we run it inside of index dot J.S..

24
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.360
Let's save all these files and make sure all three are saved.

25
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.660
I'll then go back to which my browser do a quick refresh I'll search for Avengers again and I'm just

26
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.170
gonna make sure that I still see my data getting patched and yep I definitely do.

27
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.500
Okay.

28
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.430
Quick little change.

29
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.590
All good to go.

30
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.270
Let's take another quick pause and continue with our app in the next video.
