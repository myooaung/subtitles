00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:00.960
All right.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.460
Let's start working on the ability to list create edit and delete all these different products and get

3
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.880
started.

4
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.420
I'll go back over to my editor right now inside of our project directory.

5
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.160
We've got a root's folder with an adamant directory inside of it and then inside there is the off dot

6
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.490
J.S. file.

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.680
We're now starting to work on a feature that is totally unrelated to authentication.

8
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.350
So I think that all these routes around managing the user's ability to add products listings and so

9
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.110
on should be placed into a separate file.

10
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.350
Also inside the admin directory inside my admin folder I'll make a new file called products dot J.S.

11
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.170
and inside of here we're going to set up some very similar code to what we put inside of opt J.S..

12
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.890
So some stuff around creating a router associating some roots with it.

13
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.850
We're going to eventually export the router and wire up that router to our index dot j ust file just

14
00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.000
like we did with the author or previously so let's get to it inside of the new products such as file.

15
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.120
I'm going to first require an express

16
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.220
well then create a new router so remember that's going to be express dot router with the capital R for

17
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.890
then go into associates or stub out a couple of different root handlers right away.

18
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.170
So let's talk about the different route handlers that we're going to need.

19
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.450
First off we need a route to list out all the different products that's going to be one we're going

20
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.520
to need a route to show a form that allows the user to create a new product.

21
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.120
We need to allow the user to submit this form so that's three we need to allow editing that's for we

22
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.630
need to allow submitting and editing forum that's five.

23
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.020
And then finally we need to allow deletion of a product as well that's six so six routes in total.

24
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.870
Right now we're just going to worry about the listing and the new route as well it's going to set up

25
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.280
router dot get slash admin slash products.

26
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.550
So this is going to be the root handler that we will use to list out all the different products to an

27
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.970
administrator.

28
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.860
We'll come back and fill in some implementation just a bit right now.

29
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.550
We'll leave that as is next up we'll add in the get handler for showing a form to create a brand new

30
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.900
product so I'll say router dot get and we're going to show that form to a user anytime that they make

31
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:32.290
a get request to slash admin slash products slash new so put in rec and rez like so that we still have

32
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.750
several other routes to associate.

33
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.520
But for right now like I said these are the two that we're going to focus on at the bottom we'll then

34
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.740
do a module that exports of router are going to save this file on and go back to my index dot J.S. file

35
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.950
at the very top right after all the router I'm going to require in my products router

36
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.200
and then we will make sure that we associate this thing with our app.

37
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.570
So right after the existing Apple use app router or off the router we'll do app dot use products router

38
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.200
as well okay.

39
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.480
So that's all the setup we really need for right now.

40
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.290
Now one thing I want to note is that if we open up our browser and tried to access either of these routes

41
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.380
the browser is just going to hang.

42
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.280
And the reason for that is that Express is going to call our function right here but our function never

43
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.410
actually sends a response back to the browser the browser is just going to hang until eventually times

44
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.290
out.

45
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.400
So if it seems like nothing works right now related to these routes that's totally fine okay.

46
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.310
So quick pause right here.

47
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.860
When we come back the next video we're gonna start to add in the ability for a user or an administrator

48
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.290
in this case to create brand new products.
