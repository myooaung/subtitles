00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.980
Let's get started on implementing our testing framework.

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.290
So I'm gonna go back over to my terminal.

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.910
You'll notice I'm back inside of a workspace directory.

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.970
Make sure you are too.

5
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.110
So I'm no longer inside the movie's project folder anymore than inside of this directory.

6
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.200
I'm gonna make a new project folder that's going to house all the code related to our testing framework.

7
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.830
So gonna make a new folder called T in E.

8
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.700
This is the name of our testing tool.

9
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.050
We're gonna call it ti me or something like that.

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.850
It's short for test me.

11
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.400
It's kind of like the name of our project.

12
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.920
So make that new directory change into it and then inside there are going to generate a new package.

13
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.020
JS on file so I'll do an NPM in it Dash y and I'll go ahead and start my code.

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.830
Ed inside

15
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.820
okay.

16
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.890
So right away instead of my root project folder I'm gonna make a new file called the Index dot J as

17
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.000
file as usual.

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.410
This is gonna be the central entry point for my entire application so I'll make a new file called index

19
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.140
dot J.S. now there's definitely a lot of different things we need to do inside of our project and so

20
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.600
we need to kind of prioritize what we want to work on first.

21
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.520
Well there's definitely a lot of technical challenges that we need to be aware of and a lot of different

22
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.060
things we need to figure out.

23
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.330
But right now there definitely is one very clear thing that we have to do that we could probably implement

24
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.500
right now without a lot of challenge.

25
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.800
So we had said that we want to have a node based CLIA tool of sorts.

26
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.940
So that means that we need to be able to run our project from the command line inside of any directory

27
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.230
on our machine to the very first thing we're going to do is set up our project to be ran like a CLIA

28
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.020
tool just as we did for the LSA program earlier.

29
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.640
And just as we did for that watch it program as well.

30
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.240
So to implement that remember we have to add in a little bit of code to the index not just file.

31
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.430
We have to add in a little bit of code to our package not just on file and then run one command at our

32
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.300
terminal so to get started inside of my index not just file.

33
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.860
I'm going to put in that comment at the very top.

34
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:13.950
So it's gonna have the hash character then an exclamation then user bean and note after that I'll put

35
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:23.270
a console log inside of your and say running tests so let's save that well then go back over to our

36
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.340
package start Jason File and we'll set this thing up to be executed from anywhere on our machine.

37
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.050
So in package dot Jason we're gonna add in a new section inside of here.

38
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:41.440
And remember we're going to call it the bean section the name of the command line tool that we're creating

39
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.030
is going to be T M E.

40
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.830
So I'll put in the get side of your a key of T M E and then as a value we'll put the file that we want

41
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:55.760
to execute any time we run that command will say index stop J will then say this file and then flip

42
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.790
back over to our terminal back over here inside of our project directory we'll run NPM link just as

43
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.110
we did previously.

44
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.730
And then finally it which built to test this thing out by running simply T M E at our command line and

45
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.040
I should see running tests like so okay.

46
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.210
Well that was kind of an easy step.

47
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.420
So now we know that we can run this test suite from anywhere inside of our machine.

48
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.680
So now we need to start to focus on some the harder stuff and figure out how we're going to say find

49
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.250
all these different files to run enable watch mode all that kind of good stuff.

50
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.510
So quick pause right here and we'll start to tackle some the more challenging things in just a moment.
