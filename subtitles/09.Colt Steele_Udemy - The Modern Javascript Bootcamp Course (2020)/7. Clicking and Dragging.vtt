00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.120
Now that we have these borders are on the edge of the screen.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.350
I want to try to enable it click and drag functionality on this single little square right there.

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.750
So more or less the same behavior that we see over here.

4
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.800
When we click and drag on a shape adding in this click and drag functionality is really surprisingly

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.130
easy to do.

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.860
This is something that matter J.S. wanted to make really easy to add to any project so it's just a couple

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.840
of lines of code to add in the ability to click and drag something to move it around you get started

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.550
off on my index dot J.S. file I'll go up to the top and find where we are pulling off some different

9
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.090
properties from the matter library I'm going to pull off another property called Mouse constraint so

10
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.820
we're going to use this object right here to set up something called you guessed it a mouse constraint.

11
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.580
This essentially means that we're going to set up something to respond directly to mouse input I'm going

12
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.610
to go down right after our runner dot run line and I'm going to create the constraints and then add

13
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:06.870
it to our world so I will say World dot ad world and I'm gonna pass in as the second argument mouse

14
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:15.900
constraint not create as the first arguments that I'll pass in my engine and then as the second argument

15
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.960
will pass in an options object that's going to have a mouse property.

16
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:27.770
And for that I'll say mouse dot create render dot canvas and I think I missed one other thing that we

17
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.360
have to require into this file or D structure off of matter we need to make sure we grab mouse as well

18
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.980
so I'm gonna go back up here and just make sure they pull in the mouse object as well.

19
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.040
Okay.

20
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.270
So believe or not that is pretty much it right there.

21
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.560
So going to save this.

22
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.420
I'm going to go back over and now if I refresh I can click and drag on that object and throw it around

23
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.850
the screen and let us so when I click and drag.

24
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.620
I get that kind of green line is supposed to represent a spring or essentially a force that we are trying

25
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.530
to apply to this little square.

26
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.590
Now all we have to do is start to add in a bunch of other shapes to this thing and we'll have something

27
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.550
very much like demo that we saw back over here.

28
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.460
So another quick pause and let's try to add in a bunch more shapes in the next video.
