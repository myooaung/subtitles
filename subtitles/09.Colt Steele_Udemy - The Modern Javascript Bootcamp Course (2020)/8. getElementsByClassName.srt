1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,460
Next up a third way of selecting not by I.D. not by tag name but by class name.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,090
So we use a lot of classes traditionally in our markup so we can style them with CSX.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,180
And if we want to select based off of those classes we have a special method to do just that document

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:26,220
dots get elements it's plural again not singular like I.D. get element by class name and that s right

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,250
there the plurals as on elements tells us that we'll get a collection back we'll get multiple elements

6
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,640
or we could get one element but it will be in a collection just like we had in the last video.

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,830
So what classes do I have.

8
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:46,380
I've got a class called special on two allies so I could use that.

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,660
And I think that's the only class I have.

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,260
Maybe I'll add something to my H1 here.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's go with class equals header okay.

12
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,430
And I will refresh my page to get that changed.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:08,020
Now if I run document I get elements by class name of header we get that H1 notice it's in an h t mail

14
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,440
collection once again another array impostor.

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,870
It looks like an array but we don't get any of those array methods.

16
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,650
We could also select multiple.

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,320
So we have this class called special.

18
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,160
If we select using that class name we get two elements each one.

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,130
Once again it's an object has a bunch of stuff in it and if I select something that is not found like

20
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,600
the class name of chickens nothing has a class name.

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,080
We get an empty collection if I try and select based off of an I.D. We had an I.D. called What Do We

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,300
Have Maine.

23
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,960
It's not going to work.

24
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,070
There is nothing with a class name of Maine.

25
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,940
There's something with the idea of Maine.

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,110
Different methods different goals.

27
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,100
And that's pretty much it.

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,300
Get elements my class name does what it sounds like.

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,280
It's very similar to get elements by tag name except it uses a different criteria tag name versus class

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,610
name.

31
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,150
We can iterate over it using a for loop.

32
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,720
You can use a regular for loop a for of loop.

33
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,630
One last thing I'll show you.

34
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,790
It has to do with all of the methods we've seen so far is that you don't have to call them only on the

35
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,830
document.

36
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,710
If I had a very complex document let's say with like thousands and thousands of elements.

37
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:28,930
If I wanted to select one element and then further search within that one element I could do that.

38
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:36,210
So here's an example let's say I have the class of special somewhere else on my page.

39
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:36,930
Let's do it.

40
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,480
I don't know.

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,930
I'll just put it here.

42
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,670
I'll make a paragraph with the class of special and just put some stuff in there.

43
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,240
Refresh my page if I want to search for elements with the class of special.

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,270
If I do document that get elements by class name special I'm getting all three.

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:05,070
If I only want to get the elements with that class instead of this well I can first select the UL so

46
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:15,030
I could do that with get elements by tag name get elements by tag name and I want you all that gives

47
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,270
me a list so I'm going to take the first one from that collection and save it to a variable called you

48
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,180
will.

49
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:31,140
So now I have this variable UL which is an object and it has its own copy of Get elements by class name

50
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:41,440
or tag name so I could search within this well and pass in special and now I only get those two allies

51
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,590
that have the class of special because I narrowed it down I'd narrowed my search first to the UL I started

52
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:55,390
in a variable and then I searched for special as a class within that UL versus earlier I looked for

53
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,900
all elements in the document with that class and I got 3 so I could mix it up and you know use tag name

54
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:12,490
again instead of the UL you l doubt get elements by tag name and then pass in Ally and I get the same

55
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:18,430
thing and now I get three elements because there are three allies I'm not using class I'm looking for

56
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:25,600
any ally in the UL one very important note here is that good element by D does not work this way because

57
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,240
ideas are supposed to be unique across the entire document there should only be one element with whatever

58
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,110
ideas bear photo there's no functionality to search within another element you don't need that you just

59
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:45,340
search based off of the entire document so we don't have access to you l dot get element by D we only

60
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:52,090
have well I mistyped it if I type get ELA men you can see you get elements by class name and by tag

61
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:58,540
name we don't have I.D. All right so you can win it with down like that you can find one element save

62
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:04,630
it to a variable search within that if you need to and that's it for these three basic ways of selecting

63
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,870
get element by d Get elements by class name get elements by tag name next we're going to see a whole

64
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,570
new way of doing it a little bit of an improvement a nicer way of selecting where you only need one

65
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:16,930
method.
