1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,390
Next up we'll see how we can create elements from scratch and insert them or add them to the dome so

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,710
we could create an image.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,870
Give it a source.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,730
Put it on.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,870
I don't know the beginning of the page or put it inside of a div.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,680
We could create 100 links with different you URLs and insert them into the dom.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,570
So here's how we do it.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,300
The first step is to make an element and we have a method called Create element so create element is

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,600
actually really simple.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,370
It's document doesn't create not attribute and create element and you pass in a string of the type of

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,720
element you would like.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:41,550
So if we want to make a let's do a H two element we pass in H2 and that's all we get.

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,190
It makes an empty element for us but as we've seen many times so far this is not what it actually looks

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,550
like.

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,080
This is only the HCM representation.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:58,290
Let's save it to a variable we'll call this new H2 and then let's do our console that desire of New

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,790
Age to it's an object.

18
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:09,770
So we're making a new element of type H2 and if we take a look at the element itself we have let's see

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,030
we've got each team all heading element that's the type of element it is.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,480
And we have tag names set to H2 and there's no text content there's no energy content or enter each

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,630
team out in enter text they're both empty.

22
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,530
So if we want to put some content in that's a separate step.

23
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,630
All we've done is make an element.

24
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,410
So we made an empty H2.

25
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,180
Then if we want to add into it we could do new H2.

26
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,360
So let's just look at new H2 one more time.

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,200
It's empty.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,880
New Age to date in enter text equals what should we put here.

29
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,660
I like animals.

30
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,830
Sure.

31
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,940
Oh I missed my quote.

32
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,210
Okay so now if we look at new H2 here's the representation of it.

33
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,950
I can also continue to manipulate it.

34
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,320
I can add a class if I wanted to.

35
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:07,830
I would just do new to New Age to that class list is probably the easiest way.

36
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,800
Dot ad and what classes do we even have.

37
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,420
Do we have any good ones.

38
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,400
We have to do we have special.

39
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,750
Let's use the class of special.

40
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:29,780
Now we look at H to her new H2 and that's what we've got an H2 attribute of class set to special and

41
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,580
the inner text.

42
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,000
I like animals.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,530
So how do we get it in the DOM.

44
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,680
How do we get it to show up.

45
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:41,450
Right now it's completely severed in its own little universe in the womb of the javascript console.

46
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,880
How do we get it into the real world onto the page.

47
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,060
How do we deliver this element.

48
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,910
Okay enough of that metaphor here.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,020
What we need to do is select an element to append it too.

50
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,850
So we have some methods here.

51
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,720
The first one we'll see is called append child.

52
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,580
Where are you.

53
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,860
They put that on here.

54
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,510
There it is.

55
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:06,410
Append child so append child is a method that we call on a parent that we want to append an element

56
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,710
into.

57
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:13,920
So if I wanted to append this H2 into let's go to our HD.

58
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,730
How about we put it in this section here.

59
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:24,530
I will select the section and then call append a child on the section and pass in our new H2 so we'll

60
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:33,580
select that section document that query selector of Section save that to a variable.

61
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:40,590
Okay and then we'll call section append child and we pass in our new age to.

62
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,820
This is the new element we've already made and we're now connecting it into the DOM by saying append

63
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:52,630
a child to the section and a child just means anything inside of this section.

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,820
We've already seen the children property when we append it will go to the end of the children.

65
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:07,300
So it will append down here we should see it show up after broccoli and do we.

66
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,110
There it is.

67
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,010
I like animals.

68
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,660
If we look at our H camel in the elements tab scroll down.

69
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,720
We have a section the UL that was already there.

70
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:23,110
It's now joined by a new sibling is h to let's do a couple more examples.

71
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,300
We also have the ability to make all sorts of different elements so why don't we try making an image

72
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,740
so I have an image you are I'll use here from on Splash we'll make our new image so concept.

73
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:44,600
New image equals document that create elements and we pass in image.

74
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:53,190
And if I just do that and I run my code again let's take a look at new image the same thing console

75
00:04:53,190 --> 00:05:01,860
dot DVR image new image we can see that it's also an object of course for making a new element but it

76
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,660
has a different type it's in HD him out image element so it behaves differently.

77
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,910
We don't have in our text we don't work with inner turmoil because an image does not have an opening

78
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,070
and closing tag but it does have a source.

79
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:20,010
So let's set the source new image that source equals and I'll copy this you are all I have.

80
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,010
You could put any.

81
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,410
You are well there and now let's append it somewhere.

82
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,420
If we call a pen child again on the section it will go inside of the section.

83
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,990
If we don't want to append it to the inside of the section I just wanted to go at the end of my body.

84
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,790
I guess they would go after the script which maybe isn't ideal but what I could do is use the body and

85
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:49,830
call a pen child on the body or I could put it inside the form but let's do document body dot append

86
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:58,230
child and then we pass in our image document dump body dot a pen child of new image.

87
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,310
It's quite a large image.

88
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,260
Oh boy.

89
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,690
Very large but there it is.

90
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:12,600
So we could also give it an inline style say new image dot style dot with equals two hundred pixels

91
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,940
refresh again much smaller much more manageable maybe even a bit larger about three hundred.

92
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,070
So this process is really common.

93
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,520
We make a new empty element of some type.

94
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,500
It's always going to start out empty and then we fill in the blanks when appropriate we fill in in our

95
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,920
text if we need to we fill in source or a draft or classes we add an attribute.

96
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,300
We can do whatever we want.

97
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,890
So here's one more example.

98
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,650
I have a link for a YouTube video.

99
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,420
Let's make a new anchor tag.

100
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,150
So I'm going to copy my Euro just so I can use it and we'll do content.

101
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:55,200
New link equals document that create elements of an anchor tag.

102
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,530
That's the type and then we'll set the inter text

103
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,260
not him Albert.

104
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,330
Enter text.

105
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,420
Let's go with Mr. bubs video.

106
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,020
So that's the name of the video.

107
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,580
Wrong place for that period Mr. period Bubba's video click me.

108
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,530
And then we want to set the sauce.

109
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:17,930
No.

110
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,440
The truth source is for an image for a link an anchor tag.

111
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,710
We want a traffic and then let's append it to the page somewhere.

112
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:35,550
How about we select the paragraph maybe the first paragraph and we'll add it inside the first paragraph.

113
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:50,700
So concept first P equals document dot query selector p tag first p dot append child of new link.

114
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:59,010
Fingers crossed there we have a new link right here it was appended as a child of this existing paragraph

115
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:06,810
if we click it by the way it does open up our YouTube video so that's the basics of creating elements

116
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,390
you can create them of any different type you can fill them with content enter text you can even use

117
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:18,420
enter each team Al if you wanted to you could even append other elements into each element so we could

118
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:25,800
create an anchor tag and then create a new empty span or a bold tag and append that to the new link

119
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,770
and then take that independent to first paragraph so we're not done with creating elements we'll actually

120
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,540
get a little more practice we're gonna build a little example something slightly more complex and I'm

121
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,160
also going to show you a few more methods where instead of appending at the end of something but if

122
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,570
we want to insert at the beginning the first child of an element instead of the last.

123
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,180
So that's coming up next.

124
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:54,660
Oh and if you've never seen this video oh Mr. bubs is quite the character here it's a very special dog

125
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:02,280
he does not like not like love and attention or he has an odd way of showing it but this is my favorite.

126
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,370
Okay here we go.

127
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:09,870
Yeah I got you I got this on camera anyway.

128
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,560
All right.

129
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,490
Back to Dom stuff.
