1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,710
Rather than start working on our maze application right away I first want to try to recreate this demo

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,220
very quickly making this demo is actually easier than you might think.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,240
And it's going to just get us a little bit more familiar with matter J.S. before we dive off the deep

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,180
end and start worrying about May's generation and a bunch of different crazy topics.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,370
So in order to create this demo right here we're going to create a variety of different shapes.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,800
We need to make sure that they can all be clicked on and dragged around with the mouse.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,500
We also need to make sure that we show for rectangles along the edges of the canvas as well.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,850
So I need one on top one on the right one at the bottom and one on the left.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,470
The purpose of these different rectangles is to just keep our shapes from flying off to the outside

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,480
world.

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:48,340
If we go back over to our application right now and we turn off the is static write their song and commented

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,730
out and then refresh.

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,600
We saw that our shape can very easily just fall off the face of the earth.

14
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,270
So in order to keep this thing on the screen we just have to show some rectangles around the border

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,760
to make sure that it doesn't fall off.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,290
That's pretty much it.

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:09,260
We're going to make sure that we can show a rectangle on the top right bottom and left so to do so.

18
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,940
I'm going to go back over to my index dot J.S. file.

19
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,570
I'm going to find where I'm creating a rectangle right now and I'm going to delete it and then I will

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,080
replace that with a comment that says simply walls.

21
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,640
As we start writing matter J.S. code we're going to be creating a variety of different shapes inside

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,800
of our index dot J as file over and over again.

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,950
And so it's usually very good practice to add in some comments to describe the bunch of shapes are about

24
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,600
to add right here because otherwise it's gonna be kind of challenging to remember exactly what code

25
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:44,940
creates what shapes then I'm going to create an array called walls like so and inside of here I'm going

26
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:51,030
to create the four different rectangles that we need going to first start with the top rectangle local

27
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,400
bodies dot rectangle.

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,940
Remember that the first two arguments are the x and y coordinates of the center of the rectangle.

29
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,280
And the third and fourth are the width and height of the rectangle but this very first one.

30
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,880
Let's take a look at a diagram and just make sure that it's really clear what numbers we're going to

31
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,730
put in here.

32
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,540
It's the rectangles right here represents our canvas as we saw just a moment ago our canvas is eight

33
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:24,070
hundred units wide the rectangle that we want to show is essentially going to be like this right here

34
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,140
noticed that the rectangle is not completely inside of our canvas and that's totally okay.

35
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,310
That is actually what is going on on the demonstration back over here.

36
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,990
We can see that this rectangle is actually halfway on the screen and that's evident because that little

37
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,210
red line right there the red line is essentially at the center point of the rectangle.

38
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,890
So the rectangle doesn't have to be all the way on the canvas.

39
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,180
It can be half on half off and that's what we're going to do as well just to make our code a little

40
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,560
bit easier to understand so we need to first provide the x y coordinate of the center of this rectangle.

41
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:05,630
So the center will be approximately right there or so so that's going to be for 100 units over and it's

42
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,530
going to be zero units down.

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,610
So a y of essentially zero then in total.

44
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,240
This thing's going to be eight hundred units wide and it's height Well the height doesn't really make

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,050
a big difference.

46
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,060
We just need to make sure that we have some kind of rectangle there we might use a height of like 40

47
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,460
or so but really it's totally up to us.

48
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,890
We can have any height whatsoever so long as it has a defined height.

49
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,380
It just can't be zero.

50
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:39,910
So let's now take those values back over to our Ed sit back over here.

51
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:51,070
I'm going to do a 400 that's 400 units over zero units down eight hundred units wide and 40 units tall.

52
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:58,630
And then I'll put on the options object which is static is true and then after that I'm going to make

53
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,620
sure that I add this wall's array to my world.

54
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:07,810
So just a second ago we saw that we could call world dot add with lowercase world and then whatever

55
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,680
our rectangle was.

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,430
So like bodies dots rectangle or whatever so we can pass either a single shape in to the world dot add

57
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,510
method or alternatively we could pass in an array of shapes as well.

58
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,060
And that's why I created this as a was array so gonna pass all these different walls that were gonna

59
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:36,800
create in at once it's going to save that go back over refresh and now I can see the top while on there.

60
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,220
Okay.

61
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,730
So that's a good start.

62
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,460
So now we can repeat that same process for the three other walls as well.

63
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,890
Only just very quickly draw out what the next two or three are going to be.

64
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,420
So for the next one.

65
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,610
Let me just do a little bit of erasing here just make sure things are nice and crystal clear easy to

66
00:04:53,610 --> 00:05:03,150
read so we can do the bottom one next to once again this is going to be 400 units over it's going to

67
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:14,390
be now 600 units down because remember our overall canvas is a hundred by 600 it will be 800 wide and

68
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:27,110
once again we can use 40 tall so I'm going to call bodies dot rectangle again we're going to be 400

69
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:36,550
units over this time we're going to be 600 units down we're going to be 800 units wide and 40 tall then

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:44,360
is static is true so I'll once again save refresh and I can see the bottom border.

71
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,990
Hey let's get through the last two here really quickly.

72
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,580
I think you get the idea now but honestly we're going to have to do all this time mentioning stuff so

73
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,450
often for this application that it's kind of worth just putting in a little bit of time from the get

74
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,130
go to make sure that these different values are really clear plus new.

75
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,530
Now do our left barrier.

76
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,710
So this one will be slightly different.

77
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,340
So again we are a hundred by six hundred overall.

78
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,400
So we're now going to go down 300 units.

79
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,970
We're going to go over zero.

80
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:22,430
The thing is going to be 40 units wide now and 600 units tall and then something very similar for the

81
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,920
right hand side.

82
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,760
We're going to be 300 down

83
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,570
going to be 800 over.

84
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:45,710
So eight hundred to the right we'll have 600 tall and 40 wide.

85
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:53,440
Let's do both those Audi's dot rectangle that will do the left hand side first.

86
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:05,510
So this one is going to be zero over three hundred down 40 wide 600 tall.

87
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,100
And then finally the right hand side

88
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:22,810
so we'll do eight hundred over 300 down 40 wide 600 tall and I'll get the at is static true as well

89
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,520
okay.

90
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,240
So let's save that.

91
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,890
Hopefully I didn't make any mistakes if I did.

92
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,170
We'll do a little bit of troubleshooting very quickly refresh and.

93
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,610
OK.

94
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,080
It actually all was correct.

95
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,480
So I've got top bottom left and right now.

96
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:41,370
If we go back over once again and I add in one last rectangle like the same kind of plane rectangle

97
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,770
that we had before and this time rather than assigning it to a variable I'll just add it into the world

98
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,790
directly.

99
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,320
So I'll do a world dot ad with the world's bodies dot rectangle

100
00:07:54,110 --> 00:08:03,600
and assume I'll do two hundred two hundred fifty fifty save this refresh and now a rectangle falls down

101
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,690
but it hits that other one and it just stops right there.

102
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:06,960
OK.

103
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,990
So that's definitely a good start.

104
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,680
So let's take a pause right here.

105
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,860
When we come back the next video we're going to throw in a ton of other shapes and we'll make sure that

106
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,110
we can drag them all around with our mouse so quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
