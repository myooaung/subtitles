00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,880
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,770
We've made it to one of my favorite sections Dom events so this is where things start to get real.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,910
This is where we can actually make cool applications that do things instead of just running code to

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,600
change the color when the page loads or change the color of something when you type it into the console.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,740
We need to understand those fundamentals selecting and manipulating but we have one missing piece which

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,310
is events events allow us to run that code to create a new element or to remove an element or to change

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,360
a color when a specific interaction happens from a user.

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,180
And there are tons and tons of different events out there.

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,140
This is a small sampling of some of the events that we can work with in our browser.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,040
If we take a look at any modern Web site these days there are javascript events everywhere.

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,910
Here's an example I was just using this Web site.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,260
Can I use the outcome.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,390
A couple of videos to go and see there's a hover event.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,730
When I mouse over something we get a pop up that's done via javascript.

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,880
We've got click events.

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,320
When I click I'm loading new content or at least showing and hiding different tabs.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,280
We've got other events like that see if I come up to the top as I start typing I'll get new search results.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,660
How about color.

19
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,180
There we go.

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,110
A whole bunch of new search results that's all happening through javascript.

21
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,590
So just on this one page I have events when I'm typing.

22
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,600
That causes some code to run.

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:31,650
I can type something invalid like that or I can type transform and get results showing up I've got hovers

24
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,730
I've got clicks I'm sure there are others that I'm skipping.

25
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,520
And then here's another example I just signed up for a troll account in a throwaway email.

26
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,170
And it does a little tutorial for me it wants me to make my first board so I'm gonna type a name in

27
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:55,200
here my first cello board will be my life goals and notice what's happening as I type something is changing

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,330
over here.

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:03,910
That is DOM manipulation as I hit these keys every time I type a single character this element that's

30
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,270
over here whatever it is a span a paragraph and H 3.

31
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:15,480
Who knows it's being updated maybe it's into Texas changing I'll click that click is an event.

32
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,470
So is this one to go back.

33
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,130
I'll go forward though and here's more of the same.

34
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:26,680
I can change some titles of these default lists things to do I add my exclamation points over here and

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,470
it's updated here so there's an event as I type something is happening over here.

36
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,080
My interaction is triggering something and more of the same I guess I can add some titles here things

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,330
to do in my life.

38
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,910
I would like to explore the ocean in a submarine.

39
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,390
OK.

40
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,190
What else would I like to do.

41
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,090
I would also like to release an album.

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,130
OK I can hit Enter by the way which is a different event I can click to move forward or I can just hit

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,610
enter and now I moved a step forward.

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,020
All right then over here and see I've got some other things I can add to my checklist.

45
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,500
I'm just going to do some gibberish here and I'm ready to get started.

46
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,880
So those are all quick events and typing events but now we've got other events I can drag to reorder

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,760
things.

48
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,460
This is an event in JavaScript it's actually a couple of different things there's dragging there's dropping

49
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,490
there's When I mouse over when I drag over something.

50
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,740
Notice how I get those like this shadow I guess a little gray background showing me where I would be

51
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,840
dropping this.

52
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:35,250
I've also got drag and drop within I think do I oh I think I just deleted one undo that.

53
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,010
Try this again.

54
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,760
How do I reorder.

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,450
There we go.

56
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,810
I can move these around I can click.

57
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,040
That's an event.

58
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,150
Click again to undo.

59
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,760
I'm sure there are other events I'm missing but already we've seen dragging dropping hovering.

60
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,880
Clicking typing all of these are events that we can listen for and there are way more.

61
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,580
This is a small sampling of some of the more common ones I've tried to group them on the left side.

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,890
We have things that are definitely more common on the right side somewhat common so we can listen for

63
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,120
clicks in our javascript and run some code when somebody clicks.

64
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,080
We can do something when someone drags or drops or hovers or scrolls.

65
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,200
That's a pretty common one.

66
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,820
When you scroll on a web page sometimes there will be like an animation that triggers when you scroll

67
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,840
to a certain position.

68
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:27,610
We have events for forms being submitted key presses focus and blur so focus is when you're in an input

69
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,500
like this.

70
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,970
It's focused right now.

71
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,220
And if I click away it's blurred.

72
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,220
We can run code in those scenarios and actually write there.

73
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,750
We're seeing that happen live.

74
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,940
If I go to edit it noticed that I get all this stuff over here.

75
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,660
I've got this great out background and then when the input loses focus all of that goes away.

76
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,540
So there is some code that says when that input loses focus when the user clicks away then hide all

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,380
that extra stuff or change the colors or whatever happened.

78
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,250
We've also got mouse wheel events.

79
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,320
I don't think I've ever worked with one of those but they are available.

80
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,660
Double click.

81
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,020
Not as common.

82
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,870
Then we have copying and pasting.

83
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,550
I've maybe used them a couple of times but these allow you to run specific code when a user copy something

84
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,620
or paste something into an input.

85
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,800
For example we have events for when audio starts playing or audio stops playing or when audio initially

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,790
loads when it completes its load.

87
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,110
We've got screen resize events even printing events.

88
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,910
I've never used these but there are two events one called before print and after print.

89
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,440
I think that's what they're called.

90
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:38,320
When a user goes to print a Web site and open up that print dialog before it opens there is an event

91
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:44,290
that we can tap into and run code and after the user's clicks the print button I guess there's another

92
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,320
event that we can listen for.

93
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,710
I've never used them but they exist.

94
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,400
If you go to MDA and there's a page called event reference and this contains all of the different names

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,450
of the events in javascript that we can work with and they're grouped together.

96
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,900
So we have mouse events when a user clicks or double clicks when they mouse down which is when you depress

97
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:11,920
the key or depress the mouse button but you don't have to release versus a click is a click a full click

98
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,810
down and up.

99
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:19,750
We have mouse leave so that's when a mouse leaves an element that it was hovering over.

100
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,330
We've also got things for dragging and dropping you can see there's quite a few drag drag and drag enter

101
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,530
drag start.

102
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,230
We have things for media not as common at least in most of the apps that I do.

103
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,820
We have no audio.

104
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,910
What do you have play.

105
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,390
Playback has begun on a piece of media is playing when the playback rate has changed.

106
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:47,900
When a user has seeped forward when they've skipped forward or backwards volume change events time update.

107
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,570
OK.

108
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:54,130
I'm not even sure what that when does the time indicated by current time attribute has been updated.

109
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,400
All right.

110
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,490
I'm sure there's a use for that.

111
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:05,170
We have things like progress events storage events update events value change events and further up.

112
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:12,130
We've gotten a few events when a user goes to full screen mode scroll events resizing printing which

113
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,600
I mentioned kind of obscure stuff.

114
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:20,630
We've got animation events when an animation starts focus and blur network events.

115
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,530
There's just so many of them and you're never going to use all of them.

116
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,800
Well I'm sure somebody has but it will be pretty difficult to use all of them.

117
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,010
I'm going to focus on the most important ones but the great news is I'm going to show you the pattern

118
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,970
you follow where you can use any of these events with just one method.

119
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,740
It's actually pretty straightforward so we've got a lot to talk about here but it's honestly just one

120
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,220
method that we're going to cover after the very next video.

121
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,460
So I'll see you then in like five seconds.

122
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,860
If it auto plays I'll see you then.
