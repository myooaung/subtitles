1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,630
All right.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,420
So it's time for our first official video in the the real learning part of this Dom stuff.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,340
We saw some demos.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,850
We got a little taste of the Dom talks about HD amounts to assess and what you need to know.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,140
This is really video one of learning the dom.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,620
So we're going to start with the most important part of the Dom the document.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,770
Remember Dom stands for a document object model and the DOM is just a representation of an actual document

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,120
made with a bunch of objects and they're assembled into a tree.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,060
This shape that we see over here there is a hierarchy.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,250
They're not just sitting out there in some random order.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,430
They're not in an array for example.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,050
I mean they could be but then how would we know the relationships between parents and children and the

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,790
structure.

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:51,000
So they are put in a tree like structure here with branches and in every tree there is a top most piece

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,160
what we call the root of the tree which is kind of the opposite of a regular tree I guess the roots

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,180
down at the bottom.

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,650
But anyway we've got the root of the tree which when we work with the DOM is an object called document.

18
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,150
So document is an object you have in every single browser window that you ever open.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,730
You can type document every web page.

20
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,900
Here's one of mine.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,600
This one the simple each Tim LCROSS demo.

22
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,610
If I type document right here I get a annoying printout.

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,590
This is not what it actually is.

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,740
This is the dev tools just showing me the HCM L in the document.

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:35,080
But if I do console dot DNR document we can see the actual underlying object.

26
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,900
Now this object represents the entire page this entire document.

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,630
If I go to the MBNA page this is actually the docs for the document.

28
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:55,210
If I look at document and do the same thing console that desire instead we have another object and they

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,320
follow the same pattern.

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,570
They have a Euro right.

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,280
There's a Euro right there.

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,530
My euro is different over here on a file protocol.

33
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,710
I'm just viewing my HCM Al file versus here.

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,370
I'm looking at developer dot Mozilla dawg.

35
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,770
And the document contains tons of properties tons of methods.

36
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,300
This is really where we start with everything.

37
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:25,050
So all of the other objects all of the other pieces of the Dom are located within the documents somewhere.

38
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,530
It's all nested into a kind of large confusing structure.

39
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,750
If you are trying to navigate it yourself and if you recall from the last couple of videos everything

40
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:43,810
that I was doing I was typing document dot something document dot get element by I.D. document dot body

41
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,930
dot children document dot get elements by tag name there's all of these different methods and properties

42
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,500
and they're all contained within the document object.

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:59,500
So the document is the entry point that we use to access the DOM to manipulate things to just view the

44
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:06,280
content in the DOM but also to add events and add functionality it's all located instead of this one

45
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,090
objects the document and everything else stems from there.

46
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,070
So it's created for us automatically we don't just like we don't create the DOM ourselves the browser

47
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:20,200
does it when it loads the page same idea the document will be there for you when a page is opened in

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,190
the browser or when you view a web page.

49
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:28,180
If we take a look at my web page again here's the document that I printed out as an object.

50
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,210
We'll see a couple other things that might make sense right now.

51
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,760
How about images.

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,050
This is a collection of images on the page.

53
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,810
There's one image right now.

54
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,940
If I go to the MGM version and I look at document dot images

55
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,280
we have what 12 images on this page.

56
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:55,320
If we go back to my version and we instead look at something like how that document does.

57
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,690
All right here.

58
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,660
This is a property that contains every single element on the page.

59
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,340
Things we see and don't see.

60
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,140
So the title meta tags the head script tags if we have any.

61
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,530
They're all included here every single one is turned into a javascript object and itself has tons and

62
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,860
tons of properties.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,620
And as you can see here if you were trying to navigate this manually and trying to understand it all

64
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,340
this is just completely overwhelming.

65
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,190
But fortunately we really don't need to know most of it.

66
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,130
So the main takeaway here is that we get all these objects for free.

67
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:35,380
We load up the web page in the browser whether it's a file or we're going to some Web site and the DOM

68
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:41,470
is created all of it is stored instead of one object called the document but the document has references

69
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,620
to all those other objects as you can see here.

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,090
If I go to document dot all this is just one way of looking at other elements.

71
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,450
I've got 12 now what 21 different elements.

72
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:00,310
If I do it on MDA in that document object dot all has holy cow eighteen thousand nine hundred and forty

73
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:08,080
elements in each one is going to be a big massive crazy object that has tons of stuff inside of it.

74
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,130
So that's it for now.

75
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,680
The document is our entry point and that's why all of these methods we run all of these properties will

76
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,520
look at or at least the majority of them start with document dot something document dot do something.

77
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,340
So we'll see our first batch of methods in the very next video.

78
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,090
Very exciting.

79
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,040
I think maybe.

80
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,330
Okay.

81
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:25,600
By.
