00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.010
Next up we'll see a much better way to add multiple styles at once.

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.240
So if we go back to our code here I'm going to make a couple revisions.

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.470
Get rid of this hover style.

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.560
It's quite janky and we have all these allies.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.910
Why don't we make a fake to do list.

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:22.310
So I'm going to just add in some content we'll do it maybe here before the form so I'll add in a.

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.030
Well a couple allies and the first thing I'll do it on the.

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.660
You'll add an idea of how about to dos and then I'll have a bunch of allies.

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.130
Each one will have a class of to do single to do not to use the UL will have to dos as the class.

10
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.980
And then we'll just have some basic to dos.

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.670
I know it's not very exciting.

12
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.010
Let's go with mow the lawn.

13
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.570
And then a couple more things.

14
00:00:49.590 --> 00:01:00.090
If you milk the cows and what's one more feed the alpaca is alpacas and then let's also add in a checkbox

15
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.520
next to each one of these.

16
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.040
So I think I'm going to make my to revise this.

17
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.900
I've changed my mind.

18
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.650
I'll fast forward.

19
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.410
I'll show you what I do.

20
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.070
OK so I have three allies each with the class of to do and I've added a button inside with just an X

21
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.180
as the text.

22
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.130
This is what we get three different buttons three different allies and they all have a class of to do.

23
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.830
So now I'm going to add some basic styles to my to do class.

24
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.720
I also like to do and why don't we do font size slightly increased so maybe 30 pixels.

25
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.750
Let's see how that looks.

26
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.220
Okay.

27
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.740
And I'll give them a color of Olive.

28
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.610
And why don't we just start there.

29
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.930
Okay.

30
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.870
So I have my three tattoos here each with a button.

31
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.960
Now if I wanted to add some styles to mimic the crossing off of one of these to dos I want to turn it

32
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.000
grey so change the color.

33
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.300
I want to add a line through effect which is the text decoration property and to assess maybe I want

34
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.780
to shrink it down so it takes up less space maybe change the opacity different things that I could do

35
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.050
if I want to do all of those at once to mimic what happens when you click here or you click on a checkbox

36
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.080
which doesn't exist right now with what we know it's totally possible.

37
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.040
We could do a query selector to grab the very first one.

38
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.490
Let's get that first to do which is instead of the to dos I.D. And I'll just get extra specific.

39
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.990
We could just do this but I'm going to get extra fancy so that we select the first to do class instead

40
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.250
of the to dos I.D. element.

41
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.300
I'll save that to a variable cost to do equals.

42
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.490
And then I can go to work applying one style at a time to do that style that color equals and I'll change

43
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.580
it to gray suit e a let's see is that working.

44
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.850
OK.

45
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.820
So it is great.

46
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.260
Now to give it text decoration it's the same thing.

47
00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.640
I just have to pay attention to camel casing and then the property name or the value is in line through

48
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.720
all refresh.

49
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.470
Is that working.

50
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.860
Yep.

51
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.210
We get our line through.

52
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:16.470
And why don't we also change the opacity to do that style dot opacity equals and maybe 50 percent that

53
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.210
can work for us.

54
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.490
Okay.

55
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.200
So now it is extra see through.

56
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.370
I also could have just done an RGA color but this is better because we have three properties and as

57
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.270
you can see it's three separate lines one per property.

58
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.340
And imagine we want to apply 20 different properties radical changes to one of these elements.

59
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.210
This is not very ideal.

60
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.490
It's not good at all.

61
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.720
So what is the solution.

62
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.060
What's the best way of achieving this.

63
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:50.740
Using a class so we define a class in our CSX we could call it completed or finished or how about done

64
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.700
and we'll set a color to be gray.

65
00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:03.190
We'll set text decoration to be line through and we'll set opacity to be 50 percent.

66
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.020
So now we have this class that the element does not have but we can selectively apply it.

67
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.100
So I'm going to comment out the individual lines.

68
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.590
And now let's apply that class to apply the class we've actually already seen one way of working with

69
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.380
the class.

70
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.310
I think I have my to do over here.

71
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.670
Yeah.

72
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.200
So I selected it here.

73
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.290
I'm just accessing it in the console.

74
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.270
We can use get attribute class is an attribute.

75
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:38.650
So I can retrieve the current class and I get to do I could set attribute like this set attribute class

76
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:46.300
and then give it the class name I want to add I want to use to set the class and we called it done right.

77
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.530
Done Yep.

78
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.340
So I can do this and it works.

79
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.380
Our styles are applied but if we look at what happened and you can see here the font size changed that

80
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:04.180
to do has lost the to do class it has the done class which is what we wanted but we completely overrode

81
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.550
the to do class.

82
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:06.730
So not ideal.

83
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.930
That's the downside of using set attribute set attribute just takes this value here and automatically

84
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.430
replaces the current class.

85
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:25.120
So I could do this to do space done to apply to classes and that works but that requires me to hard

86
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.270
code in what I'm trying to achieve.

87
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.270
What are the classes.

88
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.730
If I have five different classes on one element and all they want to do is add the done class.

89
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.480
This is not the best approach.

90
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.010
So this brings us to a new property we haven't seen called class list.

91
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.560
Now class list is an object representation.

92
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.370
It's called a dom token list.

93
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.640
It kind of looks like an array but it's not.

94
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.880
And it contains the classes that we have on this element and it's not just about containing the classes

95
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.570
or allowing us to see them.

96
00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.870
It also provides methods so that we can do things if we open this up.

97
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.760
We have a add method we have a contained method we've got.

98
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.520
What else do we have a toggle method that one is really useful and I can call these on the class list.

99
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.310
So let's cover up the left side of the screen and pretend we don't know if the two do currently has

100
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.320
the done class or not.

101
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.740
So we can still see it there it's gone.

102
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.450
We don't know if it has it or not.

103
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.220
And I want to make sure that it does not have it.

104
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.340
I want to remove it.

105
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:41.030
The easiest way is to do class list dot remove and then passing the class name and if we scroll up it's

106
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.110
gone.

107
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.530
If I try and remove it again.

108
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.090
No problem.

109
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.630
So this is already a nicer improvement.

110
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.990
Using said attribute I can't just say remove this one part.

111
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.680
I have to say here is the entire new class string containing all the old classes I want and not containing

112
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.700
done.

113
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.120
But if I do it this way I can just say get rid of done.

114
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:08.540
If it's there or it could go the opposite I could do to do that class list dot add and it will add done.

115
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.340
And if it's there already it's not going to keep adding it.

116
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.490
If we look it just has one done.

117
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:19.000
But perhaps the most useful part is the ability to toggle a class.

118
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.480
So if it's there already then remove it.

119
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.510
If it's not there.

120
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:32.140
Add it and we have a method called toggle to do just that toggle done so it's removed.

121
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.140
Now it's added removed added over and over and over.

122
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.460
Pretty good.

123
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.410
So this is useful.

124
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:44.390
If we were to rewrite this ourselves without class list and that method it would be kind of annoying.

125
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:56.430
We would have to access to do that get attribute class and then do maybe dot includes done and figure

126
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.930
out if that's true or false.

127
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:05.520
So if it's false then we want to add in done so we would do to do that set attributes class and then

128
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:17.950
we would take the current value so to do that get attribute class and then we would add into that done.

129
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.780
This is quite janky.

130
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.100
So we're saying I want to set attribute.

131
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:27.180
I want to set class to be the current value of it plus the string done.

132
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.420
And now we look at to do that.

133
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.910
Get attribute class that works.

134
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.130
And then if I wanted to toggle it again I could do to do it I get attribute class that includes done.

135
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.180
Now it's true.

136
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.890
So I would want to remove done and you said attribute.

137
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.360
It's a nightmare to have to do it well.

138
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.470
Nightmares may maybe an overstatement.

139
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.300
It's not great but if we use toggle it's super easy.

140
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.010
We don't have to care if it's there or not.

141
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.630
We just say toggle it and flip it if it's there.

142
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.910
Remove it if it's not there.

143
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.070
Add it and notice that it does return true or false.

144
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:06.090
So if the class is currently not applied right now done is not applied.

145
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:13.220
If I toggle it and it adds it in it returns true if the class is already there and I'm trying to toggle

146
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.060
it again it returns false when it removes that class.

147
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:23.360
So to summarize the class list it's a really really nice property we have access to because we actually

148
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.500
apply and remove and toggle classes all the time.

149
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.760
We saw the downsides of applying styles one at a time.

150
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.440
It's annoying for one thing to have to type them on different lines.

151
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.260
We have to pay attention to camel casing and also our styles end up all in our javascript.

152
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:45.050
We're writing basically a style sheet right here versus if we did it this way with a class we keep all

153
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.250
of our styles together.

154
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:52.340
We write them one time we put them in the actual SS file so it has all of our C Ss and we just pick

155
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:58.130
a name for the class and then from our javascript we can selectively apply and remove and toggle that

156
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.410
class so we can do it all in the batch.

157
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:07.040
One line right here adds in our case it adds three different styles but we could have one hundred styles

158
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.030
in one class.

159
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:13.490
So this is generally the better approach to change styles using JavaScript unless you are just changing

160
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.330
one thing you want to change the color it's a one off.

161
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.720
I don't know.

162
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.930
You just want to make something green or you want to change the font size if you want to hide something.

163
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.910
One time then go ahead and use the style property but if you're doing multiple styles at once or you

164
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.840
