00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.430
Next up we'll talk about a couple of different properties that I'm just grouping together their properties

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.210
that we can directly access on individual elements.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.150
So let's start with a simple example.

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.370
When we have a form if we want to retrieve the text in a form input or the values from a form we have

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.790
an attribute on those elements called value.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.920
So if I go to my form here I have a couple of different inputs.

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:33.360
I'm also going to add an input with type equal to checkbox and let's do another input with type set

8
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:45.650
to range and we'll give it a Men of one hundred and a max of 500 so we have a couple of different inputs.

9
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.190
We'll save.

10
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.690
Now let's select one of them or all of them.

11
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.610
Why don't we do all of them.

12
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.400
Sure.

13
00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.310
So we'll do a refresh of the page first and then document that query selector all this time or we could

14
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.620
have done get elements by tag name but I'm going to do query selector.

15
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:11.690
All input and save that to a variable cost inputs and let's take a look at one of these inputs.

16
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.120
So I'll just print the whole thing out or return the value and open one up.

17
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.140
If we scroll down there is a property Down Under V called value and it's currently empty.

18
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.160
But if I fill in a bear name like talk over the bear and we do the same thing again I'll have to rerun

19
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.500
this.

20
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.650
I'll look at inputs one more time or are actually let's just do inputs to zero dot value you'll see

21
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.610
it's now taco.

22
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.530
So value is how I can get the value out of this form.

23
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.420
Same thing with a password input.

24
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:54.370
If I do inputs of one dollar value yes I do have access to that text in the password input.

25
00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.060
Those dots are not there for real security purposes they're there to hide the password from other people

26
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.690
but it's not there to hide the password from your code.

27
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.270
It needs to be sent to it in a request usually to a server somewhere.

28
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.910
So that value has to remain.

29
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.690
So we have input one dot value we got the password value out of there.

30
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.110
Now what about a checkbox.

31
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:26.760
If I do inputs of two dot value we get on and if I check it it's still on what's going on here.

32
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.420
So let's look at inputs of two

33
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.400
How annoying.

34
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.930
If I specifically called one out it does the HMO representation.

35
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.670
If I look at all inputs and I go to the index of two and we scroll down you'll see we have a different

36
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.230
property called checked.

37
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.640
So this is a different property we can use for checkboxes specifically so we get checked as false.

38
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.900
So I'll close that back up and we can do inputs to dot checked.

39
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.280
So this video is like I said kind of just a group of attributes that we can access.

40
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.900
So these are HMO attributes because I can change a value from age to amount if I want there to be a

41
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.970
value in the form when it loads.

42
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.460
I could say value equals what would be a good name for a bear.

43
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.630
Talk of the Bear Grylls the bear.

44
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.570
How much is Buck Bubba.

45
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:28.010
I'll refresh the page and that value is in there and if I read selects the inputs and I look at inputs

46
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:37.580
of 0 9 0 dot value it set to Bubba and I can change it to and this is a common thing we actually do

47
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:47.030
not usually to change the input to be something else like plus equals Bubba the bear probably wouldn't

48
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.580
do something like this with code and change someone's input although it's possible maybe you're doing

49
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.270
some sort of fancy input where as the user types you're adding spacing in or you're validating it or

50
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.930
I don't know but usually the way that we change the input value is to reset it to an empty string.

51
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.780
So if the user submitted the form and we captured the information with JavaScript by extracting the

52
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.700
values and then we do something with it which we haven't talked about yet and events and all that stuff

53
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.140
to come then afterwards we might reset it to an empty string.

54
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.260
So it goes back to an empty input.

55
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.160
Think of a search bar you go in to read it or something or I don't know if some web that has a single

56
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.060
page search if you type something in you hit enter you see some new stuff load and your search bar usually

57
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.800
empties out.

58
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.610
Not all searches do that anyway.

59
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.940
Sometimes we can reset the input if we want to by setting its value to an empty string.

60
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:52.300
If we go back to this checkbox again we saw that if we check it and we do inputs of two dot value it

61
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.600
doesn't change but if we do inputs of two dot checked we now get true.

62
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.170
If I uncheck it we get false.

63
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:05.110
So that's how we can use javascript to read out the value from text inputs password inputs or read out

64
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.800
the checked state of a checkbox.

65
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.890
What about this slider.

66
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.510
This range goes from one hundred to 500 I think.

67
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.760
And if we do inputs of three dot value it's giving us 130.

68
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.010
If I go up it's 437.

69
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.890
Right now it's set so that the step of the range is 1 I believe the default.

70
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:37.040
But if we give it a step of 50 and refresh run our code again just select all the inputs and then we

71
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.970
take a look at inputs three dot value it's three hundred and I'm now stepping by 50 at a time.

72
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.020
So we do it one more time it's now 450.

73
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.440
Okay so that is value and checked.

74
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:56.750
There is one other attribute that we have direct access to on each element on each input element at

75
00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.890
least which is place holder I can change placeholder text.

76
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.040
Really not that common but right now the place holder of this password input says password.

77
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:14.390
If I select that input which is in my list of inputs from query selector all it has index of no index

78
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.470
of 1.

79
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.370
If I do place holder I can retrieve the current placeholder text or I could change it to something else.

80
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:30.860
Place holder equals please enter password and there's my placeholder text it's been updated all right.

81
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.900
So that's how we can work with inputs.

82
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.940
We also have a couple other attributes that we can directly access off of elements.

83
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.120
Let's add an anchor tag in somewhere in my HMO.

84
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:49.580
It doesn't really matter where I'll put an anchor tag and give it an A TRIP OF CATS dot com slash cute

85
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.710
and then some text in here.

86
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.090
Cats are adorable sometimes.

87
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.260
Refresh my page.

88
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:06.440
Let's select that anchor tag so I'll do a query selector of a need to add my document that query selector

89
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.930
save that to a variable.

90
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:13.040
Call it a and let's look at a dot a trip.

91
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.640
There we go.

92
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.530
Notice.

93
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.010
Well this is my fault.

94
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:25.030
I did a relative link I didn't actually add in w w w dot and a protocol so we end up with the file protocol.

95
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.710
That's where I am viewing this file from.

96
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:34.640
But if instead I add an H TTP colon slash slash www.youtube.com slash.

97
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.300
Cute.

98
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.070
Run it again.

99
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.890
Select it.

100
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:39.330
Here we go.

101
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.480
Now it's a link to a Web site that may or may not exist.

102
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.840
I'm probably not going to click it and I can also change the link if I wanted to.

103
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:57.730
To now be HDP call and slash slash w w w dot google dot com and if we look at that element I'll just

104
00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:58.790
inspected.

105
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.020
Where are you all the way down here.

106
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.920
We changed that a trip and now goes to Google and if I clicked it it would take me to Google dot com

107
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.910
assuming I didn't misspell anything.

108
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.490
So that's another H Timo attribute we have access to.

109
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.270
If you're not familiar with the term attribute by the way it's these things here where we have some

110
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.490
word equals something in quotes.

111
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.750
Usually it follows that pattern.

112
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:26.640
Class is an attribute idea is an attribute source it's an attribute ult on an image is an attribute.

113
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:34.180
And for some of these attributes we have this access like directly on the object for value on an input

114
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.650
as we saw for a trough and on images we can access the source.

115
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:43.520
So if I wanted to change this image source to something else let me get a new image I'll be right back.

116
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:49.330
I have a Euro on my clipboard now and if I want to select this image and change it I can easily change

117
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.100
the source.

118
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:57.070
There is a source attribute so we'll select the image with good old document that query selector of

119
00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:57.580
image.

120
00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.440
That's the type of tag we want.

121
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:06.040
There's only one on the page so we'll get the one and only one save it to a variable and let's take

122
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.760
a look at image source.

123
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.410
There's the U.R.L. that the image is currently displaying.

124
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:15.720
If I update it to this you are all I have on my clipboard.

125
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.390
There we go.

126
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.470
New image.

127
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.290
Very cute little cat under a blanket.

128
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.900
So that's uh that's kind of it.

129
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.880
We have these different attributes that we can access directly through the DOM.

130
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.810
We'll see in the next video that we have some attributes that we can't access that way.

131
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:36.220
And we have a different mechanism or a different way of changing them and reading them in so that's

132
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:36.880
coming up next.
