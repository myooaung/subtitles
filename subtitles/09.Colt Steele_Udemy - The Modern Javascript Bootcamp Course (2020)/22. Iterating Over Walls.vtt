00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.710
Now that we have formed up our verticals in horizontals arrays we need to take those two arrays and

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:12.200
use them to figure out where to draw the different walls on our canvas using matter J.S. want the old

3
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.090
dimension right away.

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.620
Is that the different walls that we're going to show are going to be drawn using the rectangle shape

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.440
if we spoken about several times with Matthew see me with matter J.S..

6
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.750
So we're going to use a rectangle to represent each individual while segments.

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.420
So now we need to essentially just iterate over all of the verticals and all the horizontals and for

8
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.020
every false value that we find inside those two arrays we need to draw a rectangle onto our canvas.

9
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.950
Let's first start off with horizontals.

10
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.960
We're going to figure out how to iterate over that thing and then draw some number of rectangles using

11
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.050
the data inside of it so I can go back down to the bottom of the file and down here.

12
00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:00.400
I'm going to iterate over horizontals using a for each statement I want you to recall that horizontals

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.650
is a two dimensional array.

14
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.660
So when we do a for each on it we're going to receive one of the inner arrays.

15
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.030
I'm going to refer that to that as a row and inside of here I'll do a console log of row just to verify

16
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.390
that that is going to be a array of boolean values that represent where I want to draw some wall segments.

17
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.110
So going to save this in a flip back over refresh and there's the two console logs right there.

18
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.160
So now we need to iterate over these two arrays and whenever wherever we find a false value that means

19
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.450
that we need to draw a wall segment onto our canvas.

20
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.220
Remember false means there is a wall.

21
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:46.410
True means there is no wall so to iterate through those inner arrays we'll do a row dot for each and

22
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.530
I'm going to receive each boolean value as an argument that I will call open.

23
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.820
The idea here behind calling it open is that we're essentially saying whether this is an open segment

24
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.560
of wall or not.

25
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.960
So if open is true it means that it is open.

26
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.230
It's an open passageway and we do not need to draw it while segments then inside of my.

27
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.780
For each the inner one I'll say if open is true then just return.

28
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.420
So we don't want to draw anything in this case.

29
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.830
Now of course we don't actually have to do a comparison with true right here because open is a boolean

30
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.510
already.

31
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.990
So we can just take a look at open and say hey if open is true then return so.

32
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.370
Otherwise if open is false then we do want to draw a wall segment.

33
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.410
So I'm going to create a new variable called wall and we're going to create this out of bodies dot rectangle

34
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.560
so we need to now decide on exactly what arguments we're going to throw inside of there what arguments

35
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.080
we're going to pass to bodies dot rectangle.

36
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.770
Remember the first two arguments are the x y values to the center of this rectangle and the third and

37
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.850
fourth arguments are going to be the length or the kind of width of the rectangle and the height so

38
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.130
calculating those values out is actually going to be just a little bit challenging.

39
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.420
So let's take a quick pause right here.

40
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.530
When we come back the next video we're gonna show you a couple of different diagrams to help you understand

41
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.020
how we're going to calculate those different dimensions.
