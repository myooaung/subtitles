00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.530
Hey welcome everyone.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.310
In this section we're revisiting our good friend of the object.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.470
So there's a lot more to talk about with objects than what we've seen so far.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.480
Object laterals are useful to store key value pairs like we've been using them to store arrays or numbers

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.720
or strings or even other objects.

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.100
But there's much more to talk about with objects.

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.860
Objects are very central to JavaScript not only in the code we write but also to the way javascript

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.920
actually works behind the scenes.

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.180
So this section I'm calling the Secret Life of Objects is not really a secret in any way.

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.720
It's very well-known stuff about objects.

11
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.340
So we have a couple of goals here.

12
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.330
We're going to cover a pretty diverse group of topics.

13
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.480
They are all united by the thread of objects that all have to do with objects.

14
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.530
In some way we'll start by talking about new syntax enhancements nice little short hands or shortcuts

15
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.160
for common things we do with objects.

16
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.860
So we'll start there then we'll talk about methods how do we add methods to objects or how do we create

17
00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.680
methods.

18
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.670
We'll talk about prototypes and this last point here is an important one we'll talk about the keyword

19
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.340
this the bane of many javascript learners existence is something that we'll spend a lot of time on in

20
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.520
the rest of the course.

21
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.710
We're not going to cover everything you need to know about it right now but we'll get our first taste

22
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.810
of this and see how it works.

23
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.750
But we're gonna start with a nice new syntax enhancement called a shorthand properties shorthand properties

24
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.330
are a new addition to javascript with ease 2015.

25
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.230
They're not supported in Internet Explorer but that shouldn't stop you from using them.

26
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.780
It's a nice easy way to create an object literal when you have variables and you want to create a property

27
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.860
where the key name is the name of your variable and the value is the value in the variable.

28
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:53.460
So here I have a function called get stats which is passed in an array need to just update this.

29
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.600
I just moved this into a new function.

30
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.370
Okay so it passes and we pass in an array and we calculate the max of the array.

31
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.890
The men the sum of every element and the average.

32
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.670
So when I call it here and passing in the reviews array representing Yelp reviews or something similar.

33
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.970
What I wanted to do is return an object that contains all of these stats.

34
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:25.400
So something like this return Max is set to max the men property is set to the value of men some is

35
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.440
said to some and average is set to average.

36
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.270
So this works and this is how we had to do it.

37
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.490
Intel is 2015 with the shorthand syntax came along.

38
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.210
So if I run this right now and I take a look at stats we do get an object back and it's what you expect.

39
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.240
We have the keys.

40
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.650
Some men Max an average and their values are set to the corresponding values from the variables.

41
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.790
But with this shorthand syntax what we can do is write it like this return and then we simply write

42
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:08.600
Max men some and average and this will create a key with the name of Max the value with the value of

43
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.240
Max.

44
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.900
So we're taking variables that we have and using them to both set the key name and the corresponding

45
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.320
value.

46
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.980
If I refresh my page over here and I look at stats we have the same exact output or the same return

47
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.680
value.

48
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.060
It's just shorter.

49
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.460
We don't have to duplicate the key in the value it's done for us automatically.

50
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.770
So that's pretty much it for the shorthand syntax.

51
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.290
Here's an example from early on in the course when we covered functions one of the exercises was to

52
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.070
build a get card function which returns an object.

53
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.090
I'll just call it over here containing a suit and a value.

54
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.880
This would be representing a single playing card and the way that I wrote it was I have a pick function

55
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.320
that picks a random element from an array and then I have my cards the values and then the suits and

56
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.280
I am picking a value for saving it to a variable called value.

57
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.660
Picking a suit saves into a variable called suit and then returning an object where we have value set

58
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.050
to value a suit set to suit so we could just improve this very quickly by just doing this instead.

59
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.830
And if I save and run it one more time it still works.

60
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.120
All right so nice shortcut syntax.

61
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.980
Just remember it doesn't work in Internet Explorer like almost everything else it's nice to use in JavaScript.
