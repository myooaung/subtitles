00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.460
Next up let's look at the method slice slice is another very useful one.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.080
It does kind of what it sounds like.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.930
It's similar to the string slice method.

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.660
It takes a portion of an array and it makes a new array with it so it doesn't impact the original doesn't

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.120
modify the original array but it allows you to select or copy a part of an array into a new array.

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.750
So let's take a look.

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.180
I have an array called animals.

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.890
It has a whole collection of animals and there are different types.

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.200
For example the first three animals in here are all swimmers.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.310
So I could create a variable called swimmers and set that equal to animals dot slice and then I want

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:50.150
to slice starting at index 0 so I'll do that index 0 and then I'll keep going all the way until whale.

12
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.470
But the second number we provide is not going to be included.

13
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.850
So if I did zero up to index of two it doesn't include index of two.

14
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.140
And so if I look at swimmers now it's only shark and salmon.

15
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.780
So I need it to go to index three.

16
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.400
It always confuses me.

17
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.920
I mean I understand why they designed it this way but it does not include that index so it goes from

18
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.930
here including this one up to but not including this index.

19
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.890
So now if we go from zero to three we'll refresh the page.

20
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.180
We get swimmers.

21
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.970
Shark salmon and whale of course we can take something from the middle of the array.

22
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.260
Let's go with whale and bear.

23
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.320
Those are both mammals.

24
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.950
So let's select mammals equals animals dot slice what would be the correct indices here.

25
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.640
So I want whale and bear the starting index is 0 1 2 and the ending index.

26
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.540
We only want to go to index of three but we want to include that.

27
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.810
So we need to go to four.

28
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.630
So up until index of four we look at mammals we have whale and bear.

29
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.640
And now lastly let's get the reptiles lizard and tortoise.

30
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:14.230
So we could do let reptiles equals animals dot slice and we have a bunch of different options here.

31
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.450
We could do it explicitly going from index of what is this five here.

32
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.340
No four index of four to six.

33
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.880
Even though there is no index six the highest index is five right here.

34
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.280
This will work because it goes up to six not including.

35
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.040
So let's just verify.

36
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.930
Refresh the page.

37
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.600
We look at reptiles lizard and tortoise.

38
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.010
So that does work.

39
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.730
We also could have written it this way.

40
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.740
So I'll I'll duplicate this line and comment out the first one and change this to just be for.

41
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.240
If I just sliced from four it's going to assume it should go all the way to the end.

42
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.080
And if we verify it still works it goes from index of four until the end.

43
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.810
In our case there's only reptiles left in the array.

44
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.390
So that works and there's one other variety.

45
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.640
One other thing that we can do with slice.

46
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.040
We can pass in a negative number and if we pass a negative number it's going to count backwards or work

47
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.750
backwards from the end of the array.

48
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.290
So to select let's see these four.

49
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.130
They all have four legs.

50
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.570
So they are quadruped which who is a quadruped quadruped.

51
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.520
I'm not sure.

52
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.170
Well I looked it up and I was extremely wrong.

53
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.690
It's Quadra with a U PED to select those three.

54
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.070
I could do animals dot slice.

55
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.350
I could do what we did earlier and do it explicitly.

56
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.780
I could go from index of three to the end or I could call animals that slice negative three.

57
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.480
Let's make sure that I'm right and I am we go back three indices or three elements from the end and

58
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.840
you can actually combine those if you wanted to we can do animals dot slice past in a negative number

59
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.450
like negative and we'll do negative three again which gives us the last three items but I could tell

60
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.170
it go to negative 1.

61
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.740
So this would be fair to lizard.

62
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.280
So it goes three elements back and it stops one element back.

63
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.090
That's possible.

64
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.760
You can't do that as well.

65
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:24.060
And then if you just call slice with nothing animals that slice like this it makes a copy of the entire

66
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.910
array for you and you will see people do this as a quick way of making a copy of an array.

67
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.480
It doesn't impact the original it just makes a new one.

68
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.810
So we could go with let's copy equals animals that slice.

69
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.840
And now we have two versions copy and animals.

70
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.640
We'll talk about why someone would do this why make a copy and how is this different than some other

71
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.580
ways of copying.

72
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.580
And just a few videos we're going to return to concept and reference types but we have a couple more

73
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.450
methods to talk about.
