1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,150
Just make sure it's really clear why this refactor was so significant.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,620
I want to show you how quickly we could change some the code inside these different options we're passing

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,530
in and get an autocomplete that works.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,810
They very different source of data.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,230
So just as a quick example you don't have to change your code here because I'm going to change my code

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:17,680
right back.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,580
Again this is a very quick example.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,770
I'm to go to Jason Place holder type I code dot com.

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,770
This is a fake API that can be used for testing purposes and just generally kind of messing around.

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:36,010
If I scroll down a little bit I can find a section called resources and inside there is an endpoint

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,220
that will serve me up a photo's collection.

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,940
Inside there is 5000 different photos.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,090
So I encourage you not to click that link because it's going to load up a ton of data and might make

14
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,300
your browser hang.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,910
Nonetheless I can go ahead and do it myself if I click on it after a second or so I will see it that

16
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,640
if I make a request to this endpoint I'll get back an array of objects where each object represents

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,820
one photo each photo has a title and a thumbnail.

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,990
You are l I'm going to try to make a request and get just 50 of these photos inside of my code and I'm

19
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:14,260
going to try to render each them in to that autocomplete that we just put together if I want to only

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:20,620
get 50 photos instead of the 5000 that it just fetched I could add on to the URL question mark album

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,380
I.D. equals one and that will give me only the first 50 photos inside of here.

22
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:30,110
So if I scroll down I'll see that I only get 50 photos total OK.

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,340
So to change my autocomplete to work with this source of data instead I would take this you URL and

24
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,000
again you don't have to make these changes I'm going to change my code back very quickly.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,040
This is just a fast demonstration.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,250
I would then go and update my fetch data function.

27
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,610
So instead of making a request to the OMD API I'm going to instead just paste that you are Ellen directly.

28
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,150
So slash photos album ideas equals one.

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,590
These programs are technically not going to be used but I can still just leave them in here.

30
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,100
The request is still going to work.

31
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:05,640
So I'll take him out just be sure just make sure it's really clear they'll take those out well then

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,300
make sure that when I get the response there is no longer a search property so I'll take out the DOT

33
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,590
search so this should work correctly to fetch the data.

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,900
Now all we would have to do is make sure that we update how each of these gets rendered that is controlled

35
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,300
inside of render option right here.

36
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,880
So instead of the current code I have I would instead say maybe just return

37
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:41,880
an image element with a source of movie dots and let me double check the name of the actual image thumbnail

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,390
you are El

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,800
and then I'll do the title which is title the movie that title

40
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,000
notice I'm still calling this argument movie it.

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,920
Now technically is like an image object but it's just not a good use time to change the variable name.

42
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,190
Okay.

43
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,920
So now I can save this put back over refresh in Nashville to just type anything inside of here.

44
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,540
Technically there's no longer any searching operation going on and I'll see this very different source

45
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,050
of data being used.

46
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,900
So now I've got each thumbnail which is the colored squares you see one with the title of each image

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,010
showing up next to it.

48
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,550
And I've got all 50 being rendered out right now.

49
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,600
That's pretty much it.

50
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,460
That's all we would have to do to make a significant change.

51
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,920
The autocomplete we just go back to these functions that we understand exactly what they do perfectly.

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Know this one fetches data.

53
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,350
This one controls how each option gets rendered.

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,440
Make those very few changes and that's it.

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,840
We now have a widget that works a totally different context.

56
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,790
So that's just all I want to show you.

57
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,110
I'm gonna very quickly undo the changes I just made and go back to working with movies.

58
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,360
And there we go.

59
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,540
So now I'll do a quick test just to make sure I'm back and still works with movies.

60
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,250
So again just a quick examination of how you change things out.

61
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,230
Let's take another pause here.

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,660
Continue.

63
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,020
Yep.

64
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,740
In the next video.
