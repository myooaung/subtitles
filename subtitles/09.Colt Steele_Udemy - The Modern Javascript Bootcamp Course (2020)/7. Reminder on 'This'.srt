1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,940
We've now got a starting implementation for a class timer put together.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,830
Now unfortunately in this video and the next one we're going to have to go into a very quick side topic

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,240
this side topic is something that's a little bit painful in javascript but that's why we're going to

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,210
go over it right now before we get too deep into this application.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,480
So the little issue that we're going to discuss is around the value of this inside of a class.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,840
This is something it was covered earlier on inside this course.

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,750
But I was going to give you a very quick reminder right here because it's going to be very relevant

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,930
for us as we develop our Timer class so honor.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,540
I want to first begin with a quick demonstration.

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,170
I'm going to find my start method.

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,770
I'm going to remove the console log inside there and I'm going to replace it with console dot log this

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,850
like so now remember our start method is going to be invoked right now whenever we click on the start

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,690
button because we wired it up with an event listener.

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,000
So that is one way in which we can invoke the start method and then good to go down to the bottom of

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,760
the file right after we create our timer class and I'm going to call timer dot start directly as well.

16
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,370
So there are now two ways in which the start method is going to be invoked.

17
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,050
It's going to be called one time automatically when our application first loads up inside the browser.

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,340
It's going to be called a second time whenever we click on the start button directly.

19
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,680
Now I want you to recall that in general we want the value of this inside of a class to be equal to

20
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,440
the instance of the class that we create because this is how we refer to different instance variables

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,410
and methods that are defined inside the class.

22
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,670
Let's say this really quickly we're going to go back over to our browser.

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,590
I'm going to refresh the page in right away.

24
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,500
I'll see the first console log.

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,490
So that is from the method called we added down right here so when we call it timer dot starts the console

26
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,180
log of this that we see is the instance of the Timer class we created.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,010
This is the result that we want.

28
00:01:53,010 --> 00:02:00,090
In general we always want a console log of this to result in the instance of the class because this

29
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,290
means that we can access the different instance variables so we defined on the class and the different

30
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,820
methods as well.

31
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,670
So this right here is a very good result.

32
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:15,590
And that is what we always want to see however if we try to invoke starts using this other way of invoking

33
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:22,010
it by clicking on the button we're going to see a very different result so I'm going to find the start

34
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,610
button and click on it.

35
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,410
And when I do so I'll see a console log of the button we just clicked on instead.

36
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,230
So that means that the value of this inside of the start function whenever we click on the button is

37
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:39,200
very different than if we just call start directly through the instance of the class that we created.

38
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,290
This is a very bad thing seen this console log right here.

39
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,000
That is not good at all because it means that whenever a user clicks on that start button we will not

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,430
have access to any of the instance variables inside of our class or any of the methods as well.

41
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,860
Let me show you a quick demonstration of why this is so important right after the start method.

42
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,590
I'm going to define a new method.

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,830
I'm going to delete this very quickly.

44
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,680
This is just a quick demonstration.

45
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,640
I'm going to define a new method called important method to call.

46
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,220
So we're going to imagine that this is a really important method that we have to call when ever Stark

47
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,200
gets invoked so then inside of starts I'm going to try to call that method.

48
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:25,120
So I'll do important method to call like so and then maybe just to make sure that we do successfully

49
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,030
call it all out in a console log of like.

50
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,460
Important thing was done OK.

51
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,930
So let's now try to save this.

52
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:43,730
We're going to go back over and refresh the page once again and I made a typo.

53
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,150
There we go.

54
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,820
Important method to call my mistake.

55
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,310
I can say that again refresh.

56
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,240
That's better.

57
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,140
So now whenever we call the start method directly through the code we have right here we have access

58
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,140
to all the other methods we defined inside of our class.

59
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,630
Once again this is good.

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,470
This is what we want.

61
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,840
However if we tried to click on the start button we will see an error.

62
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,920
And that is because when we click on the start button the value of this inside of START is going to

63
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,790
be different than if we just called start directly.

64
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,350
So again this comes back to the idea of the value of this inside of a class.

65
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,840
So in order to fix this up and in order to make sure that we can actually use a button like this right

66
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,700
here with an event listener to invoke different methods inside of our class we need to make sure that

67
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:35,450
the value of this inside the start method is what we expect it to be and for it to be what we expect

68
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,190
it to be.

69
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,860
We need to get a better understanding of the value of this inside of a class.

70
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,140
Let's take a quick pause right here.

71
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,900
When we come back the next video we're going to get a quick review on how we can determine the value

72
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:53,320
of this inside of a class and how we can change the value of this if required as in this case it definitely

73
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,460
is required to click pause right here and we'll continue in just a moment.
