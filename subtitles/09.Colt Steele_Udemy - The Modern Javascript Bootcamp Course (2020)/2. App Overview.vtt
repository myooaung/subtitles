00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.720
In this video we're going to start working on a new little project based entirely inside the browser.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.770
This is going to be a project focusing on just practicing some of our basic javascript skills particularly

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.930
classes and functions.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.630
Let's take a look at a mockup and get a better idea of what we're going to be building.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.000
All right here we go.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So we're going to be making a somewhat simple little timer application when a user visits our application

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.430
site the browser we're going to show them a number like 30 right there a play button and a pause button

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.010
whenever the user clicks on play.

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.130
We're then going to count this timer down.

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.310
So in this case it starts at 30 seconds after one second we'll go down to twenty nine then 28 27 and

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.250
so on until he eventually gets all the way down to zero as that timer is counting down.

12
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.030
A user can posit at any time by clicking on the pause button right there and then resume it by clicking

13
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.200
on play again.

14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.440
Now I'm sure this seems like a very simple and straightforward application kind of basic kind of boring.

15
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.990
But there are going to be a couple of elements inside of here that kind of make it a little bit more

16
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.960
challenging and a little bit more interesting.

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.280
Overall it's the first thing I want you to notice is that there's this circle around the timer itself.

18
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.980
We're going to have a circle drawn around the timer element.

19
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.670
And as this timer counts down from 30 27 26 and so on we're going to essentially revolve the timer so

20
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.070
you can imagine this as kind of being like a border and the border is going to kind of fill up around

21
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.620
the outside all the way until it gets to the very top again.

22
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.720
Now it's kind of a bad description of what's going on but as soon as we start writing some code you'll

23
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.730
get a better idea.

24
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.080
The point is that we're going to have an animated little border around the edge of this element.

25
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.600
The other thing we're going to do to make this just a little bit more interesting is we're going to

26
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.700
make sure that a user can click on that number right there whenever they click on it.

27
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.620
We're gonna turn that thing into a text input.

28
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.610
So a user can change the timer to say count down from ten seconds or five seconds or whatever else.

29
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.820
So it's not fixed at 30 or anything.

30
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.620
A user can change it to any time that they want.

31
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.090
And of course once it counts down all the way to zero the user can then click in there update the timer

32
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.470
to say 60 seconds and start it all over again OK.

33
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.460
So although it's going to be kind of straightforward in nature there are these couple of extra things

34
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.480
that are definitely going to have to figure out in the border part in particular is going to actually

35
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.470
be kind of challenging for you have to figure out some interesting stuff in the browser to really make

36
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.950
that work.

37
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.190
All right.

38
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.400
So now that we've got a better idea of what we're going to be working on let's take a pause right here

39
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.680
and start to do some projects set up in the next video.
