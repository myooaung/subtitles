00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.600
All right.

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.960
So right now the code works for these three rating specifically THREE TWO AND ONE.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.700
But what if the rating is something else entirely like zero would be an easy one or twenty three.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.180
But what if it's also a or.

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.080
Good.

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.470
Something like that.

7
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.680
We're not accounting for it.

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.650
We won't print anything out at all.

9
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.420
It's just ignored in our code doesn't really display anything or doesn't display anything period to

10
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.860
the user to fix this.

11
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:33.360
We can add in a third piece to our conditional we have if else if and we have else else is kind of like

12
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.900
the otherwise part of the conditional it's the thing that runs if nothing else was true before it then

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.480
the code instead of else will be executed.

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.700
So you can see down here we don't specify a condition instead of parentheses like we do for if and else

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.310
if because it just runs no matter what if nothing else ran first.

16
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.700
So we can add in and else down here just looks like this.

17
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.370
And in our situation if rating is not three two or one else will run if rating is three two or one else

18
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:06.220
will not run.

19
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.120
Just like if rating is three.

20
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.210
Nothing else runs off rating as to nothing else runs after it.

21
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.980
And so on.

22
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.920
Else is the fallback it is the final piece of your conditional.

23
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.840
You don't have to have an else but if you want to have one you must have.

24
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.580
If it doesn't make sense to have an otherwise if there is no initial if so we'll just cancel that log

25
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.360
invalid rating.

26
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.890
We'll save.

27
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.850
Refresh the page and we end up with invalid rating if we have anything other than three two or one we

28
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.200
get invalid if we go back to to that string.

29
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.030
So that won't work because we're comparing with triple equals for exactly the number two.

30
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.530
But if we go back to the number two it works just fine.

31
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.630
So often we do have an if and else f or multiple else ifs and else.

32
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.610
And by the way I forgot to mention we can only have one else per.

33
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.480
If it doesn't make sense to have more than one otherwise we can have as many else ifs as we want.

34
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.540
And we have one if at the beginning.

35
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.790
So sometimes we have all of them together but often we'll just have a yes or no a simple if and an else.

36
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.070
So here's an example.

37
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.400
I have a high score variable and a user score.

38
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.860
So the idea is that we have a game or something or we have a high score like an old arcade cabinet where

39
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.410
it stores the highest score ever on that cabinet.

40
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.900
And then the current user score and we could write a conditional that just checks if the user score

41
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.400
is greater than we could even do equal to.

42
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.820
I'm not sure what happens if you equal the high score on a game.

43
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.570
Do you then become the high score.

44
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.120
Let's just say that's how it works.

45
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.050
So if you use your score is greater than or equal to the current high score we will console that log.

46
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.360
Let's do a template literal.

47
00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.240
Congrats you have a new high score of.

48
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.410
And then let's add it in and we'll show user score then we could also update high score to now equal

49
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.830
user score.

50
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.300
If what the user scored is higher than the current high score then high scores should become that score

51
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.550
and then we can add in and else and we'll console that log.

52
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:29.370
Another template literal good game your score of and then use your score with our dollar sign to interpolate

53
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:38.500
it did not beat the high score of and then high score.

54
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.320
All right.

55
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.000
So if we run this right now refresh we get good game your score of twelve hundred did not beat the high

56
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.670
score of fourteen thirty.

57
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.670
If we change this to now be sixteen hundred.

58
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.350
Congrats.

59
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.330
You have a new high score of sixteen hundred.

60
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.040
So here we have a simple yes or no.

61
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.150
It's either this and if it's not then it's this There is no scenario where we won't have.

62
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.130
Well I guess you could write code that breaks you could write something that causes an error but assuming

63
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.220
that doesn't happen one of these is going to run.

64
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.470
We don't have a bunch of else.

65
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.610
We just have a simple if and an else.
