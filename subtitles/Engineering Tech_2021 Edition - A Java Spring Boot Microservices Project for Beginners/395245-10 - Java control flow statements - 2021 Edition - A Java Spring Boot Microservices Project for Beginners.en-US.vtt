00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.355
Let's understand control flow statements or loops in Java will declare two variables.

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:12.640
Will have a variable a with value ten.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.610
And then let say b dot d.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.770
In Java, you can write a block like this.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.304
If then a condition.

00:00:25.304 --> 00:00:28.485
If that is true, then do something.

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:31.630
We level system or statement.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.145
We didn't. If block Henry level sentence outside the block,

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:46.310
and the block is written within curly braces.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.265
Lets run this. Since a is not equal to B,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.440
naught entered this if block.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.835
So after result is alpha printed outside the block.

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:05.030
And if we change this condition to Nordic call two,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.600
it'll enter the harder we can just write the else block.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.380
And late. We didn't else block.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.820
Now this we didn't else blocks would get printed.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.880
See we did else block is getting printed.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.935
You can also have elseif in Java.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:37.730
Else-if another condition, and let's say a is less than b,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.660
then we'll say we didn't LC block.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.300
Since this condition will get satisfied, lard come here.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.370
A is less than B in this case.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.410
And you can declare multiple else-if blocks.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.200
So we didn't LC blog got printed.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:13.070
Let's now see for loop for i equals three.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.540
And then we'll say is less than ten.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.069
That is the condition.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.540
And then i plus plus.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.640
So this is our for loop in Java,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.335
you pre declared the variable.

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:28.250
So starting from three all the way up to ten,

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.010
it will do some operations.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.865
And the Ivan look gets incremented every time.

00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:38.820
I plus, plus increments the value of i.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.580
We, let's print the value of phi here.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.325
We can see the value of I0 starting from three all the way up to nine.

00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:02.750
As soon as that condition is not met, it comes out.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.290
You can also look to an array in Java using a for loop.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.870
Let's look through this entire two, which is 304050.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:25.160
So the way to do that is for int j in indirect to.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.090
Let's move dot here so that we can see the values.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.030
We'll print j.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.570
So we're looping through this array and printing the value.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.380
So we can see the value of j within the for loop.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.590
So this is how we can loop through an array using a for loop.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.600
Let's also see why looping Java will declare an integer variable K.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.440
And K is less than five,

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:16.220
print overlook, and

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.450
European increment k.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.810
Otherwise you could get into an infinite loop using K plus plus,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.130
we can increment the value.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.900
It is similar to i plus plus that we are under did. Lets run this.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.030
This should get printed five times.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.500
Starting from 0 to five.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.300
We can see that really upcase getting predict 5p times.
