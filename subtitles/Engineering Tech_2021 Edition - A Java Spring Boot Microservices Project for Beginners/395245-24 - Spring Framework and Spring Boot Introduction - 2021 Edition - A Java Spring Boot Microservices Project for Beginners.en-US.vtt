00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780
Welcome back. Let's now understand Spring framework.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.335
Using Spring framework, we can quickly Java enterprise applications.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.390
Spring provides a template for

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.915
common services like transaction management and garbage collection.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:19.830
Or developers focus only on writing the business logic and

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.640
the framework could take care of all the common concerns are common functionality.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.720
Additionally, spring provides infrastructure support like Database Connectivity.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.005
Spring framework has evolved quite a bit over the last ten years.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:42.235
At developer needs to know how to make it work by doing the right configuration,

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:46.130
setting and following the character billion deployment process.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.230
Build and deployment effort for a spring framework application is quite high.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.704
So that takes us to springboard.

00:00:56.704 --> 00:01:00.440
Using springboard, we can quickly be less ping application.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.284
Boots stands for Bootstrap.

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:03.770
So as the name suggests,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.620
we can use Spring Boot and use

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.210
the pre-configured application to quickly build and launch a new application.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.215
Spring boot is an opinionated framework.

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:18.485
That means it tells you how to build an application.

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:20.600
Washed up the features and functionalities for

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.185
non-functional requirements are already given to you.

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:25.220
And you can take

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.184
this rebuild application and do your customization and build application.

00:01:30.184 --> 00:01:35.194
Spring boot is the way to go to build any Java or spring application,

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:39.305
whether it's a website arrest surveys are a backend batch process.

00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:44.255
You can take the pre-built dot preconfigured Spring Boot application and

00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:49.580
apply your changes and just run it will be taking you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.220
through some practical examples to understand

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.340
Spring Boot better and understand how easy it is to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.160
create an application in no time or to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.250
know more about the Spring Boot framework and spring,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.035
you can visit spring dot W0,

00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:08.600
which is then often sell website is mentioned here.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.850
Spring Boot makes it easy to create

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.410
standalone production grade application or just for development and POC,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.370
you can take the pre-configured spring application and deployed on production.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.845
Springboard come sit and embedded Tomcat server.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:30.199
So you do not need to create worthwhile to deploy your web application.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:35.549
You can use the embedded server or to host your application.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.810
Let's now take a look at all the PBL preconfigured applications that are

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.655
available for us since springboard a go to the bottom of this page.

00:02:46.655 --> 00:02:49.130
Spring initializer link.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.970
You can also directly go do star dot spring dot IU.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.720
In this page, you have to select

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.360
the Project tab where there is a mammoth project of democratic.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.910
We're using Java language and discourse,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.085
and we'll choose the default.

00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:05.240
Does springboard worsen?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.540
That is shown here, 2.2.4.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.270
Next unit to choose the dependencies depending on the application you're trying to build.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.780
For example, for a web application you would choose Spring Web.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.360
Similarly, there are other dependencies.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.375
Have a leg bone for a rest service for our backend database interaction with GPA, etc.

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:29.000
Select all your dependencies.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.380
Click on this generate controlled button that you see at the bottom

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.520
of the page and generate top preconfigured application.
