00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.650
they come back.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.400
Let's understand.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:02.730
Marble.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.390
The selected Mavin is the building tools for dependency.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.040
Management,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.390
while downloading a springboard application,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.680
are creating a new project in intelligence.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.660
Let's understand it in more today.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.260
Difficult image,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.640
our application to use any external morning look too hard.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.910
The corresponding Jack files manually,

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.330
and they'll hard them to the class foot with Mabon.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.300
All the Jack files will get at it automatically.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.550
All you do is specify the required dependencies.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.090
All Mavin products come with the partner XML File Holly Could do.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.180
Is are other dependencies informed?

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.990
XML file Dependencies are nothing but expel models or jars that you would be needing in

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.870
your application.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.880
Then Mabon would automatically download those stark files from Mavin depository and our

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.030
them to the classroom inability or prompt you to download the job files as soon as you had

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.990
a new dependency.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.880
Or you can set the heart of downward option.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.860
Two years apart from managing.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.570
Dependence is you could use Mammon is a big toe.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.160
Later on,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.220
in the practical systems will understand how to use Mammon building back his manager to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.210
create a jar file for our application.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.050
Thank you
