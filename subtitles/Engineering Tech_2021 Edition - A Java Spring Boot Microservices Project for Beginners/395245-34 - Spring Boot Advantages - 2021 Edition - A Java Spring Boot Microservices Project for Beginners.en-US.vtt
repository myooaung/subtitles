00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
Welcome back.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.120
Let's revisit some of the springboard advantages with spring book were able to quickly

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.920
build an application and make it up and running.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.540
In no time you have seen how we have built a list AP A using arrest controller and then how

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.260
you connected to the database and face the gate and displayed it in the website in minutes

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.210
without being lot off configuration before spring.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.850
Would it is protected a lot of time to do the configuration,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.180
create a white file and deploy and launch and then sit out.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.190
So that is the advantage of for spring book.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.910
It takes a reputed view on how spring applications would be better block you.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.390
Take the pre built structure project and make your changes related to your business logic,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.850
and then you can quickly deploy and see the output.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.040
You can quickly build a rest API or a website with front pages controller database without

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.680
really worrying about how to make different components.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.650
What all in the concentrate is,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.480
what is the business logic that he should be writing specific to the application.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.150
Also,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.550
with springboard were ever to be the standard on application with an embedded tomcat server

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.550
.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.200
We're not creating a work silently,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.920
bring it on it with someone.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.370
Springboard produces a self contained job.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.930
Find that contents that very conquered suffer,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.870
and you can take the application and learning in the Java environment without worrying

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.870
about application server configuration.
