00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Welcome back in the service,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.480
Discovery six.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.550
And we have seen how to raise history up on the Discovery Server is a Eureka client.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.680
Then how to use our Discovery server to look up for that up?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.330
So we have a course out,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.230
which is letting it Port IV 001 and that is also registered.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.050
Eyes a wreck,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.760
a client.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.400
We can take that it pork 8761 You can see that it is registered and variable toe interact

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.420
with their top from course catalog,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.550
which is running at age two.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.310
Now what will happen when the course up goes down?

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.650
Let's find it out.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.090
So what we'll do is we'll go to the course up and shut it down.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.850
So let's go to the Porter project can just simply shut down the running application.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.190
Now,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.150
when you refresh course up,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
you'll get a never paid because the upper stopped running.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.840
When you go to the course,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.450
catalog up and try to refresh the home page,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.920
which is dependent on the course up if you give us a minute.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.430
Also,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.280
it is saying this is the fallback because there is nowhere that pace you ever told up what

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.270
to do in case another app is not available.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.950
And I displayed another Pidge.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.710
So this is not the ideal situation,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.910
because one micro service going down can take down other services also,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.490
and there could be hundreds of thousands of micro services running in a production set up.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.040
So let's understand what other picnics,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.800
every level,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.590
the handle,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.660
such failures in micro services.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.450
Thank you.
