00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
Welcome back.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.350
Let me give a quick dip on intelligent idea.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.540
Sometimes when you import products,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.960
it fails to run and there is a way to handle it.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.850
Let's see that in this lab.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.240
We'll go and download the hello World project from you.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.650
Jimmy.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:25.600
Simply download it from the resource is six on zipper.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:36.250
Now go back to Intelligent.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.750
Try to import this project.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:01:00.150
Find that folder select Maven Upson and it takes some time for the left hand panel to show

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.150
.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.850
Although source Gordon Resources this wait for that.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:13.080
And when you see a SERC main job for not everything has been interested in intelligence and

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.710
then you could run needing for the pain.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.490
And then there is another way you can important despotic from existing sources.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.790
And this is the bomb.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.250
Fine.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.790
Through it,

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.330
we manage all the dependencies.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.050
But sometimes you will not find these ramekins here for some reason.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.710
And even if you find when you click on it,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.550
you don't run.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.720
In that case,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:45.730
you have to go to the Palmer XML and we're having a really good So this year download all

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.180
the required dependencies jar files,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.810
then your project.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.070
There's a little drum fine.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:58.420
And they were also prompted for import or to say they are to import on here at the right

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.760
inside at the bottom of the off Indonesia window.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.840
Just remember that maverick Greenport and then all of your friends will be put it.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.660
And sometimes it just gets important automatically.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.010
But if you're a huge project Germany dependencies,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.470
it takes time or it fails to important.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.050
There is a connectivity issue Are because of some other reason.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.560
But make sure to do mavin cream pork and you should be good.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.350
Thank you.
