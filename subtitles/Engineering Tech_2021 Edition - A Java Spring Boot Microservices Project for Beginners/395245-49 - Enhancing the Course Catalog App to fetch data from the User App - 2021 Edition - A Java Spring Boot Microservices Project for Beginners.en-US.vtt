00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
welcome back will finish the project work in this particular lab.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.950
So we have a court sap and that we were using up.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.990
Now let's understand how to integrate the course cat look with adapts will fetch course

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.360
information from the coarser and then face corresponding usual information from the usual.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.280
So let's start all the ups,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.810
of course,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.350
of course.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.500
Catalog,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:33.000
usual rap and also the unique assault we can see that director server is running a Both

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.980
courts happened user up,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.090
Hardly disturbed.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.430
Now this is the U.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.600
N.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.080
Of the course that it is running fine and also is seldom eureka.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.220
Similarly,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.650
let's check the user up.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.700
That also looks good.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.680
Let's set the course catalog up now.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.060
Yeah,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.200
everything looks good.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.700
All four abscess started.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.150
Now,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.710
when we go to catalog,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.260
we see list off all the courses and we have a first course method also,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.530
so that gives us the first course.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.290
So let's understand how to fit users for this hard,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.850
Of course.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.280
So you get the course I D.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.580
And use that to invoke the user of service.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.920
First thing we need to do is create a user class and mapped out.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.110
Put up the use Europe service to that class.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.870
Let's simply copied from the user happen pasted in their course catalog.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:43.000
Up next will remove all the databases related annotations and imports that is not required

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.250
that you're gonna live for the course class.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.150
We need object class to map out Levi annotation not required in the course.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.000
Get low class.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.830
Okay,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.350
so this looks good now.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.690
Now let's go back to the controller.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.050
And then we defined a new object Whether you use a glass,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.860
Okay,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.440
lets to a unica look up our to find an instance of the user up service.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.830
You have to give the user up name registered name that we gave in the application,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.540
not properties,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.750
while building it is a fact.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.580
Use your service.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.050
So use that and falls because it's a non secret connection.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.750
And let's get the home visual and story may use a wrap.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.320
You and variable we left in the course I d r.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.680
So this,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.120
um because we need to face you just for a particular course is the first course subject and

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.100
we'll get the course I d from that object and simply pass it on to the user in the quality

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.410
enhanced to use erupt.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.010
Okay,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.150
records for a specific course 80.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.480
I use the rest template and involved The gate for object matured the way we did our here

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.950
for the course Aries.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.650
So it's not really used.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.610
A user objector mapped out.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.180
But you can try that also,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.780
we're simply off fitting all those years and mapping it with string variable and are

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.530
displaying the key thing we're trying to understand.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.500
Here is how to impregnate between the micro services not so much an outer for murder data,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.350
but you can definitely give it a try and extract information after mapping the football

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.650
specific object.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:48.500
It is starting now.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.410
We don't need toe restart any of the other services.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.520
As you can see,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.850
we managed to fetch all the users for the heart of class and display.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.010
So this is our be interact with their different micro services.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.450
You can try to announce this project for the try to fetch all the users for all the courses

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.610
and displayed on the website and also tried implement world tolerance for these Arab

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.220
service.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.270
There are various other things you can try,

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.920
and hopefully this product has given a good overview and you can now get started with

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.200
Microsoft is Johnny and build more complex application in the real world.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.400
Thank you very much.
