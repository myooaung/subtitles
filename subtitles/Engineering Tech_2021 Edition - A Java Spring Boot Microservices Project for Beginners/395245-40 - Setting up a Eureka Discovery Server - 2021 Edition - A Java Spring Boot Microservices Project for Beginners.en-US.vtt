00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.425
In this lab we are going to get their discovery server

00:00:05.425 --> 00:00:09.099
using which we will discover different services.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:20.600
Let's go to Start Dart Sprint dot IO will give a package name.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.640
And artifact dot project name would be 0 cost server.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.100
Keep everything else as default.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.410
Bitcoin are dependencies.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.550
Search for eureka server.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.400
It's a spring cloud Netflix Eureka server.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.210
Let's click Generate to download the project.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.610
Will allow unzip this file

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.070
mixed with Lord This project using IntelliJ idea.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.625
Let's find that project.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:25.445
It is future ex eureka server.

00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:33.360
Under this particular Java microservices directory, will select that.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.730
It takes a few seconds.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.195
Good lord. The required dependencies.

00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:46.490
At the bottom you can see resolving dependencies for future ex Eureka server.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.420
Once that is done, we should be able to see the entire project directory.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.650
Now we can see the project structure.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.150
Let's load the main Java class.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.240
Let's start enable lyrical server annotation.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.870
Added automatically includes the required packages.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.755
Next will go to application dot properties and give a port to the Utica server.

00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:36.080
Will make it run at a particular port,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.305
but usually that is 8761.

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:42.270
For the unicast server.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.920
We'll give the up in name.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.445
We'll call it a fixed discoveries that were.

00:02:55.445 --> 00:03:02.315
Next, we'll say registered with the recap faults and fate registry false.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:07.295
We'll be using the discoveries server could discover other services.

00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:11.585
How what we do not need to register the server with itself.

00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:15.420
That's where the two properties are set as false.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:30.600
Let's go to bomb dot xml and find the new dependency that Spring Boot has added.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.050
So this is the dependencies bring cloud startup,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.860
Netflix Eureka server that has been added to this project.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.190
With this, we are ready to launch the Eureka server.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.630
Let's now start dot,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.340
click on the green icon.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.385
We gotta Nader for Java Eisleben support because we did not change their default Java.

00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:05.165
And while creating the project as of January 2021,

00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:08.345
job Eisleben is their default worsen that springboard has.

00:04:08.345 --> 00:04:13.100
And now we can go back and select eight embedded at the project.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.680
Again, we can upgrade dedicated person in IntelliJ put on Java 11 project.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.930
Let's see how to do that.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.700
Go to File Project structure.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.040
Click on the adjudicate dropdown.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.020
Then are the SDK.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.030
You can click on download JDK.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.000
It will prompt you for the available options.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.390
Now it's prompting for open dedicate 15.1.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.405
Download. Then apply.

00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:05.975
The Nokia JDK installation will take a few seconds to finish.

00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:09.690
Dedicates been upgraded, let's run it now.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.900
So now it deletes days using the open dedicated pinpoint 0.01. to run this project.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.025
Click on Allow access if prompted.

00:05:31.025 --> 00:05:37.440
And now we can see a message that future xy record server application has started.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.460
We can open a browser and Lord localhost 8761.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.775
And we can see the Eureka server Dashboard.

00:05:49.775 --> 00:05:57.995
We can see some gender Lynn for both the Eureka server and under the stances 6-7,

00:05:57.995 --> 00:06:00.020
nothing is appearing right now because you have

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.410
not registered any client with the server.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.640
This is how we can set up a discovery server.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.950
Next, we'll understand how to register different services with the discovery server.
