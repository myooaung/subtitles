00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
Welcome back before we start working with database image of application.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:13.190
Let's understand Java persistence a p a r G p Using Java persistence AP A We do all kind of

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.590
established operation in a job application.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.430
Earlier,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.840
we used to write all the queries in a job program and use their jelly BC driver to connect

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.670
to the harvest.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.590
And once the reserve is faced with to convert the debtor to an object manually or extract

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.650
data from the secret local and then use that in the program,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.540
developers used to spend a lot of time in managing connection managing transaction and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.370
converting the sequel out to objects to simplify database operations.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.150
A concept called Object,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.450
relational mapping or wearing was introduced,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.240
so the idea was to create Java classes.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.850
We should map through the obvious stables,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.860
and the one framework would take care off,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.800
keeping the database table and the Java objected Memory in sync and developers could work

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.720
directly on the Java plus without worrying about how the dead eyes getting gushing without

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.320
that stupid with wearing the Nevis interaction was simplified father developers because all

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.260
their to do us mark on the Java classes,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.010
we should store the data in the memory not only about interacting with the physical

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.570
energies.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.240
GPR Java Persistence epi A is the week use order.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.490
He provides a pays to manage relational daytime job applications you need to implement G.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.850
P.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.390
D.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.700
PH.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.550
Just a guideline or specification.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.500
Hi one.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.900
It is in wonderfully what which implements worry or JPs specification.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.850
Its main job is to map job,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.120
Arctic student in the stables suggest.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.200
To summarize JP is the specification,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.710
and hibernate is one of the most popular ways to implement GP or Java persistence.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.530
Spring provides a model spring did at GP the work with GP and simply by all the date of

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.860
this infraction Hollywood to do is include the spring that a chippy a dependency and then

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.430
use the classes available in the chippy repository toe.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.430
Do all kind of database operations will be exploring more on it during the practical

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.110
sessions.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.750
Thank you
