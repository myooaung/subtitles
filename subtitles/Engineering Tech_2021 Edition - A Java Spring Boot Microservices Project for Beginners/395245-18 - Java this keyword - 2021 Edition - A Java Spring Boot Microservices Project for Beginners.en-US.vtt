00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.680
Let's understand this keyword in Java.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.190
Using this, you can access the class-level variables.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.355
Earlier we garden needed when the metadata variable name

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:18.255
and the class level variable name had the same name.

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:21.780
Let's see how to address that with this keyword.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.550
We can have same name here,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.760
but we can access the class level variable with this.name.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.340
Now this will work without any issues.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.180
And the poor do not have conflicting variable names,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.135
then this keyword is not required.

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:48.080
But it's always a good practice to use this.name in

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.235
your methodic for accessing any class-level variables such as name here.

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:54.690
Now this will find,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.265
let's see another example.

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.335
We live at new constructor,

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:03.780
which will take height as a parameter.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.800
And we loved survey class level variable height.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.660
Now will say based Dart height equal height.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.935
And let's adjust it little bit height plus1.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:39.690
And we'll print it out. We'll pin them at our document here.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.655
And my adjusted height is,

00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:49.590
we'll print the class level variable here.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.660
Now let's run this with a double value so that the other constructor would get involved.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.700
So my height is 3.4, whatever we passed.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.930
And they're just heard height is though class-level variables, this.title.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.090
And we've added one to whatever value we

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.495
passed and populated died in the class load variable.

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:13.385
So this is how you can use the,

00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:18.599
this keyword in Java to use class-level variables.
