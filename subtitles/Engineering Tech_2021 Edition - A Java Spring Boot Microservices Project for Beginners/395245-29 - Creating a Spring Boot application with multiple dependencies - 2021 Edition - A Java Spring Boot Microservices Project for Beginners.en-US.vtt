00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.180
Let's now create another spring application with few Additional Dependencies.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.180
Who do startups spring data you will give the application name is core.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.625
Sap will add though with dependency.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.760
And let's also add our spring data GPA,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.355
which we'll use to interact with the database.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:28.300
And we'll also add the Register positively dependencies.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.440
So now this application will abort the required dependencies for a web application,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.940
for a rest API,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.750
and also to do database interaction with spin delta Gb.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.900
Download the app and ship it.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.039
And let's now put it into intelligence.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:04.290
Go to File New Project from existing source and select the New Courses folder.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.340
So now this project will get imported.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.000
Suspend Mammon is that dependency manager.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.835
Click finish. And we'll open the project in this window.

00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:26.610
Last Castro terminate all application.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.580
Pre-installed one, and you'll be taken to the project view.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.300
Expander, SR, Main Java.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.490
You'll also see a Java class like the last name.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.395
And in the PalmPilot XML will see additional dependencies like springboard,

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:54.800
GPA, Spring Web, and spin STP.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.990
The three dependencies which we selected and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.440
all trees you can see have been added to the permanent exhibit.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.600
Now let's run it and see what happens.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.610
It failed because we have not really specified an EGP repository or database.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.860
Although we have our interdependency,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.940
let's remove that dependency from the palm read XML. For the time being.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.970
We'll first build an app that later when we create a database,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.680
we'll add dart dependency back.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.015
Now if we run it, it will run.

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:37.175
So we have two dependencies.

00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:41.585
We addressed EPA and the application will run as before.

00:02:41.585 --> 00:02:44.900
And using this, we can build a web application

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.110
and we can also build wrist EPA's like the last thing.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.720
So in the next lab we'll explore how to return a core subject to backwater HTP instead of

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.910
just a simple string which we planned out in the previous lab. Thank you.
