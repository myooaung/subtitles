00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
In the last lecture we created,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.010
the brand new repository pushed it to the gate of account,

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.830
and also,

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.830
we added successfully a collaborator to the project.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.550
Now the collaborator has access to the repository,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.090
and he or she can manipulate on the project.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.210
Let's go ahead and see how we can work on the repository as they collaborate,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.220
by the way to imitate the collaboration process and actually to work properly.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.560
I'm using a different computer.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.980
Otherwise we won't be able to work as a collaborator in the right way.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.160
If you have a different computer than you can use it for the second account.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.130
But if not,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.580
then you can just watch the videos.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.350
If you use just one computer,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.900
then you will get different results than us,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.230
so it might be slightly confusing.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.880
All right,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.810
so the first thing that you have to remember is that we don't need to fork the repository

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.400
anymore.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.180
We just need to clone it to our local computer as the Order No.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.690
Two clones.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.600
The repository we have to click this green button here called Clone or download.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.460
It will generate the link off the repository.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.650
Let's copy it,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.710
then go to the terminal and create a new father.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.930
Currently,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.350
we're on the desktop.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.030
Let's create a new folder,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.760
call it,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.250
gets project,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.590
cool up,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:34.410
then go into this folder and finally clones the repository.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.270
We have to run,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.150
get clone and we have to pace year.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.910
Blink off the repository.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.140
All right,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.760
so we have successful week.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.640
Phone the project.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.350
Let's check the directory.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.170
As you see,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.240
we have here a folder called Get Collaboration.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.090
Let's go ahead and and so this fall it.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.970
So if we run the history off the commits using gets locked cash,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.950
stash more online,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.050
then we will get all four commits made by the owner off the repository.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.170
Also,

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.460
if we open the folder envious code,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:18.270
we will find you in mix of HTML and style,

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.510
etc.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.550
Is this falls with the proper content?

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.330
All right,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.340
so now let's go ahead and make some changes to the project.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.670
Let's add some styles to the H one heading element.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.740
For that,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.280
I'm going to added the style that CSS file.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.970
Let's increase the phone size off H one heading element,

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:45.270
then make a new committee with the message.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.420
Increased phone size off H one.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.660
Let's around the history.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.530
So the committee is added successfully.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.070
Let's make one more commit.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.670
I'm going to change the color off h one element.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:15.050
Let's make it glow over and then make again a new committee with the message changed Caller

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.850
off H one.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.940
Finally,

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.120
that's around the history.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.310
So we have you to new chametz made by the collaborative.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.760
All right,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.120
now it's time to push these changes from the local repository to get help for that,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.150
we have to run.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.640
Get push,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.030
Origen Master!

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.060
So the command is run successfully.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.140
Let's go ahead and check to get help Accounts.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.210
As you can see,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.550
the changes air pushed fine and the repository is updated.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.780
According we didn't need a poll,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.920
a request or some permission from the owner of the project.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.450
We have pushed the changes to be get up without any problem.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.030
If we check the commit step will find two new chametz made by the collaborator.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.550
Also,

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.520
if we checked the account off the collaborator,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.190
we will get the same situation.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.570
So in general,

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.860
this kind of collaboration is not quite effective because the owner doesn't have any

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.210
controlling mechanism and that might cause some unexpected results All right,

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.130
let's stop here.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.820
And we want to the next lecture in which I will show you how to protect the branches and

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.140
how to control the collaboration process.
