00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
All right.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.710
So in the last lecture will learn about branches and get we created new branches.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.550
And also we saw how to deliver them.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.120
Let's check what branches do we have here?

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.620
For that?

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.450
We have to run gauge branch.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.400
So no.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.790
Overall,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.930
we have two branches master and feature to and we're working on the future to brunch.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.210
All right,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.420
let's check the history of commits on the feature to branch.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.980
Ron gets log,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.420
dash,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.440
dash one line.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.090
So here we have all the commits which we have made so far on the master brunch.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.780
I'm going to add new commit on future to let's add some style to the handing elements

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.490
selected and change its color.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:51.150
Then add style dot CSS fell to the staging area,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:05.350
then make Mucha meat with message styled heading and finally check the history Run again

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.980
gets locked.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.460
Dash dash.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.640
Well,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.050
not all right.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.700
So here we have our last commit and also here we see that it belongs to feature to branch,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.060
which is one commit a had off the master branch.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.410
Ok,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.850
now I'm going to show you how we can add a future to branch to our get hub recalled story.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.070
It is very simple.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.960
We just need to run,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.650
get push that origin,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:40.680
which should be followed by the name of the branch feature to now if we check our get hub

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.630
repository.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.150
The first thing that we may know this year is our recently pushed branches in this guy's

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.780
feature to and also we see green button on the right hand side.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.960
Compare and pull requests actually regarding pull requests,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.390
we will talk a bit later.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.910
So now who reload the page and drop down this button?

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.130
Here we will find branch feature to Let's go I haven't selected.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:18.150
Then go to commit Stop And you see here we have last commit which we made on the feature to

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.660
branch.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.950
All right now I'm going to show you how we can create branches from get hub and then we

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.450
will add these branches to our local repository.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.910
So in order to create a new branch,

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.650
we need to drop down this Batam it to see he will have an input field and we have to enter

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.390
the name of the new branch inside off the input field.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.970
That's eight feature one,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.370
Then we have to click create branch.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.980
So,

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.420
as you see,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.800
we have created a new branch from get help successful.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.400
If we checked tab branches will find all three branches.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.050
Master feature one and figure two as the seam master is a default branch and also on the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.210
right hand side off the feature one and feature two branches.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.330
We have some numbers.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.770
If we hover over it,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.540
it will show us that feature two branches.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.900
One commit a hat off,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.450
Master.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.650
That's because we added a new commit on feature to branch and that commit doesn't exist on

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.570
master brunch.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.980
Okay,

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.020
Now let's see how we can add branch from get up to the local repository for that.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.610
First of all,

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:40.120
we have to run command git pool origin feature one and then we need get check out dash dash

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.760
track than origin slash on the name off the branch feature one.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.150
So now we added feature want to the local repository and also we switch to it in order to

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.210
check that Let's run kids branch.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.260
So overall we have three branches,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.060
master feature one and feature to and currently we're working on feature one I'm going to

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:18.000
add new committee on get up to future one branch that's open script Js file and create a

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:28.120
variable Then make commit with the text created variable.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.890
So now,

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.860
in order to add this,

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:43.100
commit to the local repository we should run Get pull Origen and the name of the branch

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.350
feature one Now if we check the script Js file,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:57.080
you will find the newly created variable and also if we check the history of commits using

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.010
get locked dash,

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:06.380
dash one line Then we will find here over last commit So each time when you make a new

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.700
commit on get up on feature one branch Then to add it to the local repository,

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.090
you just need to run get pull origin Feature one comment All right,

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.500
let's see how we can delete the branch from D Tub And also I'm going to show you how we can

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.060
delete the remote branch from the terminal.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.810
So,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.890
in order to delete the branch and get help,

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.630
we have to go to the tab branches.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:39.660
Then we just need to click that deal it I could So as you see,

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.010
we no longer have here Branch featured one.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.050
We can do the same locally.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.210
Let's delete branch feature to for that we need to run,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.390
gets push origin that dash,

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.860
dash,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.430
delete.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.350
And then we have to specify the name off the branch featured two.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.070
So once we run this command,

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.300
then branch on get hub won't be available.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.100
All right,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.480
so we deleted branches on get her.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.380
But they still exist in the local repository,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.260
so I'm going to delete them from here.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.740
It's Well,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.280
first of all,

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.450
let's switch to Master Branch.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.530
Ron gets check out,

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.180
master,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.740
then delete branch feature one for that,

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:37.910
we need get Branch Dash D and the name off the branch feature one Let's do the same for

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.480
feature to as well and finally run.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.300
Get brunch.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.520
As you see we have here just the massive brunch.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.120
All right,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.620
that's it for now about branching on get hub.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.720
We have to consider some other topics regarding branches.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.760
And for that let's move on to the next lecture
