00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.050
in the last lecture will learn about how to create a pull request and merged two different

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.150
branches on Get Up,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.520
as it wasn't the case off the local repository.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.710
Sometimes you might have merged conflicts on the remote repository as well.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.510
So in this lecture,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.650
I'm going to set up some scenario in which you might get the March conflict and I will show

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.630
you how to deal with it.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.630
So currently we have just one branch and argued have proposed to re with a couple of

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.220
commits,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.660
Let's go ahead and create a new branch.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.590
I'm going to call it test So the new branches created.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.360
And now let's go ahead and make some commits on that newly created branch.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.110
Suppose that we want to add some code inside off the script or Js file.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.650
Let's open it,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.450
then click the addict I can and create variable.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.110
I sat itude.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.120
Some number value that's 100.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.080
Then down below,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.790
make a new commit created variable.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.960
After that,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.010
I'm going to make another commit Let's at some were code to the script or Js file,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.200
create another variable and assigned to some plain function.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:35.690
But then again make the commit with a message created function.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.750
All right,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.490
so we made two new commits on the test branch,

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.390
and now it is,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.430
too commits ahead off the master branch.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.310
Now suppose that we or someone else is going to make a new committee on the master branch,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.870
and it's trying to added the same line of code,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.840
which we have been working on on the task branch.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.550
Let's see what will happen.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.700
I'm going to switch to the master branch.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:13.860
Then let's open script RJ's file and create a new variable with some string value.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.410
Let's say hi there and then make a new committee created variable on master.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.800
All right,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.490
so all the changes are made.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.390
And now suppose that we need to merge those two branches.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.630
First of all,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.900
we need to create a pool of request for that.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.470
Let's go ahead and click the button,

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.150
compare and pull requests.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.350
Once we do that,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.710
then we will go to the page,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.210
which you're all of the family or with at a glance,

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.600
you might notice that instead off the green check mark and the tax able to merge,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.020
we have here Red X sign and the text can automatically merch.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.150
So we're facing the merch conflict.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.650
The reason is that we tried to added the same line of code from the different branches.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.440
Right after this warning taxed,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.330
we can read,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.360
Don't worry,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.370
you can still create the pull request.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.670
So despite Emerge conflict,

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.090
we still can't create April request.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.080
Let's face it here,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.080
some comment.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.630
That's a updated script.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.550
OJ's file.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.060
Then click the button.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:35.900
So now we got here another warning saying that these branch has conflicts that must be

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.490
result.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.850
Right next to this text,

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.580
there is a bottom called Result Conflict.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.690
Let's go ahead and click this bottom.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.920
Now,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.630
as you can see,

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.180
we've got here some tax actor in which we should resolve the conflict we have here both

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.620
versions of the code on.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.800
We need to choose which one to keep get help itself,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.250
cannot decide it needs our help,

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.500
and this is the exact same situation which we So while we've been working on a local

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.150
repository,

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.070
now we need to resolve the conflict manually.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.140
Suppose that we want to keep variable B instead off variable A.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.240
So let's deal it all this stuff and just keep the variable B and the function.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.560
After that,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.650
let's click Mark as a result.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.420
So the conflict is resolved and we can proceed.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.670
That's click commit,

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.310
merge,

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.150
then click merch,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.850
pull request and finally confirmed the merchant.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.500
All right.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.040
So again the conflict is resolved.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.320
Pull request is merged and closed.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.390
Now we can feel free and delete the test brunch.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.580
If we check the commits,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.350
history will find here a couple of new commits which were made automatically in the process

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.230
off emerging.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.270
Okay,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.830
so that's the way how we can resolve emerge conflicts on get hub.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.610
Now we have to move on and learn about how to copy the remote report story on a work it

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.240
have account how to chrome it to our local computer and how to contribute to someone.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.150
Alice's report Celts see in the next video
