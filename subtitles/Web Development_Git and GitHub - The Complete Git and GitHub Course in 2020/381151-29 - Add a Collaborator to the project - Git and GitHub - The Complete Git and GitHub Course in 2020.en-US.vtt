00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
hello and welcome to our new section,

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.850
in which we're going to be talking about one of the most important topics regarding get

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:08.190
help.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.880
And it is collaboration.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.560
In the previous section,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.640
we discussed how we can copy the remote repository to work it have account than how to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.620
clone it to our local computer,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.720
make some changes in updates and eventually contribute to the original project.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.640
This process is something like collaboration,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.850
but in fact it's not.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.030
In the case of collaboration,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.810
the owner off the project can add different developers as collaborators,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.760
which then will have almost identical rights to manage the project and saying almost

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.220
because there might be some rules which should be protected by the collaborators.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.760
All right,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.760
that same practice,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.660
how to collaborate on get up.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.370
First of all,

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.350
I'm going to create a brand new local repository.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.980
I have created a brand new folder on the desktop called Get Collaboration,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.040
which then opens in fierce code and also with Terminal here.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.380
Let's go ahead and quickly initialize a git repository and then make a couple of commits.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.030
Let's run,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.720
get in it so the dot get father is created.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.800
It means that we have initialized get report.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.520
Next,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.780
I'm going to create two different files.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.620
Index dot html and style Nazi Assess.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.050
Let's add them to the staging area.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.010
Ron.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:41.750
Get at dot then check the status and make a commit run.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:52.710
Kids commit desh em with a message created index on HTML and styled with CSS files.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.050
That's around the history.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.770
So here is our first commit All right.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.930
Next,

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.770
let's into the basic structure off the HTML document inside off the next elation in the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.320
file.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.260
Then make a commit.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.740
In this case,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.550
I'm going to use a shorter way.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.860
It's wrong.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.470
Get commits.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.440
Dash Am where the message added basic HTML instruction,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.750
then run again.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.850
Gets locked dash dash online.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.840
So we have here to commits.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.440
Let's make some more commits.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.140
I'm going to create an H one heading elements with a constant basis heading element.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:03:00.000
Then make a commit Ron get commit Desh am with a message added h one.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.490
And finally make one more commit That's open style that CSS files and create some reset

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.070
styles.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:18.620
I'm going to set margin and putting for all the elements as zero don't make again,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.530
a committee with the message added reset stunts.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.430
And lastly,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.430
let's check the history around gets Look,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.700
dash,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.550
dash one line.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.060
So,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.330
as you can see over all we have for commits and we're good to go now,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.460
the next thing that I'm going to do it to create the remote repose story and push the local

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.610
reports to read into it.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.690
Let's go ahead and go to our G public counts.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.880
Then I'm going to click the plus,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.700
Thank you and select a new report story.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.300
I'm going to call this re poll the same name,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.770
I mean,

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.210
gets collaboration.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.850
Then click this green button here.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.970
We've got here some instructions,

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.350
and now I'm going to copy doing from here.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.030
All right,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.980
let's go to the terminal and push the local repo to the remote repository for then we have

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.550
to run,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.850
get remote and origin,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.390
and we have to paste your the link off the report.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.250
And finally we have to run,

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:45.520
gets push origin must actually you might get you the error about the permissions.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.670
If so,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.890
then you have to change again the credentials from the control panel,

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.100
as we did in the previous election.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.860
Okay,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.220
so if we go to the get a page and reload the page.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.560
We will find you are re poster.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.040
All right,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.840
so now we're ready to set up the team off collaborators.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.280
For that,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.750
I'm going to use again a different account.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.530
So in this case,

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.430
I'm the owner off the project,

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.040
and we have to add a collaborator to the project to them that we have to go to settings.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.150
Then on the left hand side,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.660
we have to select collaborators tub where it confined the input field in which we have to

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.180
enter the user name off a collaborator.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:41.310
Let's type you code and create Web 123 As the CDU tub has found the user automatically,

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.000
let's select it and then click the button.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.110
Add collaborators.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.730
So we added the user as a collaborator.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:50.850
But on the other hand,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.640
we need to get the response from the user.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.250
I mean,

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.940
the collaborator should accept the invitation.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.190
If we check the gate of account off the user,

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.170
then there won't be any notifications or invitations.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.690
So what should we do?

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.590
We have to check the email.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.590
Let's go to the Gmail account of that user.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.930
As you can see,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.250
we've got here an email from the get up,

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.850
saying that the owner off the project is inviting us as the collaborator for the project.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.750
We should click your view invitation and then we have to accept the invitation.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.080
Once we do that,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.400
then we will redirected to archetype account.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.850
And as you can see it now,

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.360
the repository is available for us.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.990
Also,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.770
it would go back to the owner's account and reload the page.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.950
The user will be added as a collaborator.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.320
We are no longer waiting for the response.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.230
All right,

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:59.330
so in this lecture we created a brand new report story and added a collaborator to the

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.080
project Successful See you in the next one.
