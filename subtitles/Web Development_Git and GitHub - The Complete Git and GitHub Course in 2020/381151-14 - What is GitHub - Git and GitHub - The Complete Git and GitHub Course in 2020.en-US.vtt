00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
So we already have learned about the basics of kids.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.980
We have gone through some important topics.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.250
We know how to create the repository,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.910
how to make commits and also how to go back in time,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.440
check the previous states of the project and on do things.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.080
So I think we have quite enough knowledge to move on and introduce you to keep,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.360
huh?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.870
First of all,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.950
let's find out what kid hub is.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.570
As a definition,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.200
we can say that Get Hub is an online service where you can share your code or files in

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.300
order to collaborate with different people.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.050
In other words,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.810
it is another computer on which every person who is working on a specific project will have

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.370
access.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.050
For example,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.710
you can imagine a Web developer team who wants to build a website,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.680
and everyone has to update their coats simultaneously while working on the project.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.970
In this case,

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.920
get help allows them to build a centralized repository where everyone can interrupt with

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.590
each other and manage the code so eventually the final product will be built on it.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.980
Online repository.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.520
All right,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.070
let's consider a difference between get and get help as usual,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.890
people are a little bit confused regarding the difference between get and get help.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.790
Actually,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.400
as theology,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.450
no get is a version control,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.960
too,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.940
and it closes to manage the project locally.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.130
Additionally,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.650
we can say that it closes to fetch the data from the central sever or push data to it.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.210
As for the get up,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.290
it is a hosting platform which allows you to host a repository on a remote server.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.730
Besides that,

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.590
we can also say that get help is a user friendly public platform with a nice visual

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.330
interface,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.220
and millions of users are sharing their projects to the entire world.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.490
All right,

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.880
we can talk a lot more about get up and its features,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.440
but I think for now it's not necessary to overcomplicate.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.780
Things would be better if you go through the features off,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.400
get hopes that by step in the common lectures.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.180
So if you're an absolute beginner with get up,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.170
then I will show you how to use it.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.030
You need to create an account on get hub,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.630
so let's get started.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.120
First of all,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.320
we have to go to the website called Get help dot com,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.950
where you can find a very simple registration for you just need to type here your unique

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.850
user name,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.390
email and password.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.430
Once you feel up those input fields,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.250
then you have to create this green.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.170
But again,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.620
the registration process going to be very simple.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.070
So I'm sure that you won't have in trouble once you sign in first,

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.050
you should click verifying,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.130
and he will get some funny creature here,

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.000
which you have to rotate once you do that.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.830
Then click done.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.860
And after that we'll move on to a get help.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.760
Welcome page.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.730
Now we have to go through some steps.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.190
Here we have two different options to choose a subscription.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.060
The 1st 1 is free.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.020
As for the 2nd 1 is a pro option,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.870
which will charge you with $7 per month.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.940
Actually,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.350
the main difference between those two options is that in case off the free option,

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.370
you are a low to have on Lee,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.510
three collaborators for a private repository.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.970
As for the second option,

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.100
you don't have any limit for our course.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.010
The first option is absolutely enough,

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.710
so I'm going to choose it.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.800
We don't need to check any of those boxes.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.120
Let's just click continue so here,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.660
we have to answer to different questions.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.140
The 1st 1 is about the level off programming experience.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.850
Suppose that we are new to programming.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.400
As for the second question,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.050
let's check the second option learning kit and get help.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.740
Leslie.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.410
These field Empty and click.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.900
Submit.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.110
Now we need to verify our email account.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.860
For that,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.920
you have to visit your email account where he should get the email from.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.550
Get up.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.140
Once you click verifying email address,

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.670
you will get to another welcome page.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.030
All right,

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.650
I think for now it's enough.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.690
Let's continue in the next ledge.
