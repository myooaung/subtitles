00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090
Okay,

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.420
so it's time to set up the tools.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.420
I mean to install git and actually prepare our working environment.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.530
Throughout the course,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.530
we will need terminal and taxed.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.050
Editor.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.120
I'm going to use V s coat at the tax editor.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.170
In order to download BS code,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.670
you have to visit a website called code dot Visual Studio.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.220
Don't come and then download installer from here Installation process.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.970
Really simple.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.900
So I'm not going to go through it.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.440
As for terminal,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.660
we're going to use git bash which you can get automatically once you install get itself in

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.390
order to install,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.720
get,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.750
we have to go to a website called gate dash SCM dot com.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.300
Then we have to go to downloads and we have to select the operating system which we're

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.450
currently using.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.740
Besides that,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.550
on the right side,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.270
you can see here download button which automatically finds out which operating system we're

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.860
using,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.730
and it allows us to download the proper installer.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.730
For now,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.900
we use windows,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.500
So that's why you see here,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.980
download for windows.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.410
If you're using a mark that instead of windows,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.490
you will see here Mark and the same for Lennox,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.530
I will show you how to install git on Windows.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.960
And if you're using different operating system and if you have some trouble with the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.100
installation process,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.830
which I think won't happen,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.620
feel free to reach out in Q A.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.490
Section and we will try to help.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.300
Okay,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.820
let's click here and download it.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.930
Install it once it is downloaded.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.330
Let's go ahead and start the installation process.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.480
We have to click year next that we need to select the location off.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.350
Get folder.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.120
I'm going to leave it as it is.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.570
So click next,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.210
then check the first box.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.320
It will L O.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.550
R to create the icon on the desktop.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.850
But then again,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.350
next.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.830
Now we have to select the default editor.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.510
Forget,

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.940
as I already said throughout the course,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.530
we're going to use obvious code,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.460
so I'm going to select it.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.470
But if you have your favorite code editor,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.000
you can go ahead and select it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.560
So here get offers us to work by default from the command line and also from third party

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.370
software,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.350
so I'm not going to change it.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.350
Then click next again next,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.300
next,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.510
and then finally click install.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.280
But okay,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:52.340
it will take a little amount of time Once git is installed,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.750
let's click the icon as the sea git bash is opened.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.440
It means that get is successfully installed.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.560
And if we check its version using the command,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.240
get dash dash version but that it will give us the current version off.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.960
Get all right,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.830
That's it We are ready to start working with Get so let's move on to the next lecture.
