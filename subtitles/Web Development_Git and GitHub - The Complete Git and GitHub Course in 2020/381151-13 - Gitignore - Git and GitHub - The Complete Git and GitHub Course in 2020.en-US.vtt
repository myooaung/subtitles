00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
Okay,

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.910
so we have all been learned about a couple of things and get I mean,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.020
how to track files,

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.210
how to add them to the staging area,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.250
how to make commits,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.040
and also how to undo things.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.750
So far,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.250
I think now is the perfect time to talk about how to ignore files or folders from tracking

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.250
.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.010
I mean the files and folders,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.190
which should be recognized by get when you work with projects.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.740
You might have some order generated files or different folders,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.060
which you don't need to track all the time,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.870
because it might slow down your working process.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.960
So we need some solution which will follow us to ignore those thoughts for that in get we

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.130
use a dot it ignored fight.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.200
Actually,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.640
it doesn't have any name.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.950
When you want to create it,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.870
you just need to indicate the extension dot Get signal.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.140
Let's go ahead and create this fault and see actually how it works.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.590
Now let's check the status.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.810
So for now,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.280
we have just one on trucked file dot Get ignored.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.410
Suppose that we should have some text files,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.810
which we need to ignore.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.830
Let's go ahead and create them.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.350
That's a text one,

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.070
not txt and tax to dot txt.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.660
As you see,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.840
those newly created fuss are green and also we see here letter you which actually stands

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.890
for untracked.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.940
So if we check the status,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.870
then you will find that we have three untracked files.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.750
So now we need to specify those text balls inside of the get ignored front.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.760
For that,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.880
we just need to indicate the parts off the foul.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.010
In this case,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.610
text files and get ignore are placed in the same directory.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.540
So we just need to specify the find names actually,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.310
before the names we need to place forward slash,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.380
followed by the name of the father.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.570
If we save,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.890
then we will no longer have a green color with the letter you.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.590
It means that get already ignores those two falls.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.110
If we check the status,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.810
we will get just one on truck file,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.250
which is the get ignore file itself.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.520
So again,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.600
once you specify the falls and give,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.210
ignore,

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.420
then get will no longer recognize those falls.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.610
In order to prove that again,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:35.560
let's modify those text files and also create a new element in the index of HTML file.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.750
That's place your hello there.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.810
No.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.010
If we check the stages,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.050
we will get just one modify file,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.720
which is in except html.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.660
And also one untracked files dot get ignored.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.170
All right,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.540
so that's the way How?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.810
Get Ignore works.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.390
Now I'm going to show you one important thing.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.990
Suppose that we want to ignore the index of HTML and style dot CSS files as well.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.920
For that,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.200
we have to put them in,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.250
get ignore file.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:16.270
Then let's make some changes in both of the files.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:26.830
I'm going to create paragraph with some text and then insulted CSF l Let's create style for

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.950
h one heading out.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.350
No,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.650
If we check the status,

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.540
then maybe unexpectedly,

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.040
those two files will be steel modified.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.500
So in this case,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.630
get didn't ignore HTML and CSS files.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.570
And the reason of that behavior is that those too fast have bean other the modified before

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.490
we created that get ignored file.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.680
So in order to fix that,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.420
we have to delete the cash from the history.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.010
For that,

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.140
we have to run the following command we need get R M,

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:10.900
which stands for remove than dash are cash and in order to include all the fast when it

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.570
thought so.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.040
Now we clean the cash,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.770
and I want you to know that we just clean the cash and defaults themselves are still here.

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.750
So if we check the status,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.400
we will get here just the one on truck file.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.550
So now the HTML and see as it falls are no longer recognized by it.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.650
Now,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.180
as you see,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.210
changes are ready to be committed.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.150
Let's onstage falls from the staging area.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.930
We need to run kit reset dots.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.480
Let's check the status.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.460
So now files are modified.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.200
And finally,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.860
when it get check out dot So if we check the status again,

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.350
then we'll get only one contract file.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.500
Dots get ignored.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.940
Actually,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.750
in the real world,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.670
it's recommended to created dot get ignore file once you create the repository in order to

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.460
avoid such unexpected things.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.430
All right before he finished his lecture,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.470
I'm going to show you a couple of things.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.650
Let's create a new folder.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.570
I'm going to call it Odo.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.830
Jenna files.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.390
I mean,

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.700
owner generated files.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.610
Then inside this folder,

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.380
let's create several text files.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:51.490
Now suppose that we want to ignore all those text farts for that we have to indicate them

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.950
in get ignore file.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.870
Before we do that,

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.380
I'm going to show you how we can make the comments and they don't get ignore file.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:06.100
We just need to place the pound sign followed by the text off the comments.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.530
Auto generated fuss All right,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.970
so let's go ahead and specify the find names first of Well,

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.950
we need to indicate here the folder main,

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.830
although Gen falls,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:26.010
then slash and then the file name eight dot txt.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.480
Let's do the same for the rest of the falls.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.380
I'm going to duplicate this line and just change.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.270
Name off the txt fast.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.670
Let's check the status.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.860
So,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.570
as you can see,

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.280
all three files are ignored.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.570
In this case,

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.030
we have just three off them.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.640
But sometimes we might have hundreds off such falls and that indicating the file names

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.410
individually will be really crazy.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:54.810
Right?

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:01.420
So what can we do here in order to solve this problem with just one line of code we can use

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.980
and asked the risk instead off the findings.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.220
Now,

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.830
if we check the status,

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:14.170
who will get the same result so it can simply use this technique.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.450
Okay,

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.560
Now I suppose that we have another fall inside of this folder.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.050
But in this case,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.700
with a different extension,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:28.290
let's say about thoughts HTML and we need to ignore a gang,

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.520
just the text fast.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.210
So in that case,

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.310
we still need to use the asterisk,

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.150
but it should be followed by the file extension dot txt.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.010
So if we check again this aiders,

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:48.050
then we will get here dot Get ignore as the untracked file.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.490
Also folder origin falls.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.710
But it would take a look at this sideburn.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.570
You will see that only about the HTML file is untracked.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.350
All other txt files still are not recognized.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.890
You okay?

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.570
That's it about it.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.250
Ignore.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:11.020
It's really useful and half feature on you will be using it quite frequently when you will

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.200
work with your own projects in the future.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.470
Once we prepared the getting nor file,

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:21.150
let's make the commit at first added to the staging area.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:32.620
Then make the commit with a message prepared,

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.150
get ignored five.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:39.940
And finally check the he three Ron gets Look,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.220
dash,

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:40.940
dash one light.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.600
Okay,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.370
that's it.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.660
See you next time
