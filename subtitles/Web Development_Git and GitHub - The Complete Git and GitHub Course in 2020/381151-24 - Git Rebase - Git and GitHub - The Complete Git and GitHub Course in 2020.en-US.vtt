00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.430
all right.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.410
Once we're family with merging branches and also solving merch conflicts,

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.270
now it's time to discuss another feature off kids,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.930
which is called Gates Rebased.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.940
Get repast is one of the tools which is used to integrate changes from one branch into

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.450
another.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.980
In other words,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.270
re basing in the process of moving or combining a sequence off commits to a new base,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.980
commit in order to make this words more understandable.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.860
Let's take a look at this diagram.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.810
Suppose that we have a couple of commits on the master branch.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.980
Then we create a new branch and add to its a mother commits.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.290
And then after that,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.020
we create a new commit all the massive brunch.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.200
So in this case,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.560
by default based commit is the committee from where we created a new branch.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.540
But using get re pace,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.210
we're able to change the base,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.170
commit and re base our branch on the newly created commit all the master branch.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.350
Also,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.270
the changes which we made on the massive branch will be available on the second branch is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.550
Well,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.720
all right,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.640
let's go ahead and see in practice where we're talking about.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.590
First of all,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.620
I'm going to make some changes in our local repository.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.220
We have already made lots of commits,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.990
and I think it might be slightly confusing.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.880
So I'm going to delete most of them.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.230
Let's just live here for us.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.100
Five commits.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.280
I'm going to copy this I d.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.480
Then in order to deal,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.850
it commits,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.590
we have to run,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.230
gets reset Dash,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.610
dash,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.990
heart and pace you I d.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.030
So who run?

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.870
Get locked?

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.050
Dashed Rashwan Online.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.600
We will get here just the 1st 5 commits.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.160
And besides that,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.170
I'm going to delete Death Branch at all and created brand new one.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.400
So that's Iran.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.450
Get Branch Tache D and the name off the branch death.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.930
So now they branches deleted,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.270
and we have to create a new one for that.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.150
We need to run,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.570
get branch.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.870
Let's call these branch future.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:29.770
Then I'm going to switch to it and finally check the history so everything works.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.590
Fine had points to both branches.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.060
I mean master and feature,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.000
and it means that they have the identical histories.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.520
So now I'm going to switch back to the massive branch and make a new commit.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:55.030
That's changed the phone size for the heading element Let's make it 30 picks us and then

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.940
make a new commit well with the message.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.050
Changed phone size for each one.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.600
Then run the history So the new committee is created.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.430
And now the master branch is one coming to head off the future brunch.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.160
So it means that this change is not available on the future branch.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.230
If we switch to it and check the history,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.770
then you will find that he would don't have the last committee made on the massive brunch.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.570
So now if we want to make the Alaska meat from the massive branch available on the future

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.060
branches,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.560
well,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.700
we can use get re pace,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.740
which will hello us to re base the future branch on the newly created commit,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.810
which was made on the message brunch.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.240
So let's run kits re pace Master that lovely history.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.980
So now is the sea had points to both branches feature and master and means that now the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.420
last coming from the Master branch is available on the future branches.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.320
But all right,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.960
let's concede there again with different example.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.410
How get rebates burgs.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.770
I'm going to add a couple of commits on the future branch.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.270
Let's change the phone size for paragraph,

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:34.220
then make a committee with a message changed phone size for Pete.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.070
Next,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:45.550
I'm going to add some margin to the body but Saturday's 15 pixels and again make the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:56.990
committee at it margin to the body and then run.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.850
He's to read.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:05.280
So we have here to new commits and the future branches to commit ahead off the master

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.730
brunch.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.990
Now let's switch to Master and create one.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.470
Commit.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.430
I'm going to add a span element in index dot html.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.190
File with some content.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.940
This is a span element.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:30.970
And then make the committee with the message added,

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.810
Spun and finally,

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.050
let's love the history.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.210
So as you see,

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.010
we have all the commits made on the master branch.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.030
But we don't have here the commits from the feature brunch.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.850
So the next thing that I'm going to do is to switch back to the future branch and re base

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.460
it on the last commit,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.650
which we have just made on the massive brunch.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:00.010
So let's go to the future branch and then run get rebased,

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.080
master.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:09.720
So now if we look the history you will find that feature branch is re based on the last

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.980
commit made from the master branch.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.800
As you see,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.340
we have here.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.890
The committee added span and it is followed by two commits which we have made before this

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.750
committee on the future brunch.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.730
So now all the commits are available on the future brunch.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:33.290
But if we go to the master branch and check the history,

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.340
you will find that still,

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.410
we have here the commits which were made on Lee on their master brunch.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.600
Now,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.360
in order to make,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.470
um,

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.290
it's from the future branch available on the massive branches.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.750
Well,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.900
we can merge those branches so we can run,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.680
gets merch,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.740
feature.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.420
So,

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.420
as you see now,

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.060
the branches are merged and instead off three way emerge,

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.770
we have here that fast forward merge.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.380
The reason is that we change the base,

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.890
commit.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.830
I mean,

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.800
we re based the future branch on the last commit off the master branch.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.990
And that's why it gets used here.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.540
The fast forward merch.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.050
All right.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.540
Ah,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.880
helping make sense to you.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.440
I know that it might be a little bit confusing,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:29.190
so I recommend you to test those things on your own rewatched the video or if you have some

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:34.950
questions you can reach out and post them in Q A section and we will try to help.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.300
All right,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.700
see you in the next election.
