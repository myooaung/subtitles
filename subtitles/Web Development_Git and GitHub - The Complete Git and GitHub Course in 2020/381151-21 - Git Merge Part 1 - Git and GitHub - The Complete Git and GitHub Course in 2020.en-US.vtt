00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
in the last section will learn about how to create different branches in the local

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.400
repository.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.980
And also I showed you how to do the same on get help in a real world when you create

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.420
different branches and work on them,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.810
Eventually unit to combine them with the master branch,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.850
and this process is called Merging Branch.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.810
So in this section we're going to look at how to merge branches,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.160
what type of merges do we have?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.760
And also how to result some conflicts that might a cure during merging the branches.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.470
All right,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.850
let's go to a working environment and start working on merging branches.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.730
First of all,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.050
let's check what branches do we have for now?

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.870
Iran get brunch.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.230
So currently we have just one branch,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.530
which is master also.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.980
Let's love the history.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.210
So we have here a couple of commits from previous lectures.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.120
I'm going to create a new branch that's called it death,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.370
which stands for develop,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.410
and also I'm going to add a couple of commits to the new branch for that.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.020
First of all,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.180
we need to switch to that brunch.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.470
Let's rank it check out Dev,

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:29.130
then open style dot CSS file and change caller for heading Let's make it blue.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.240
Now I'm going to add this file to the staging area and then make commit,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.960
as we have other early down,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.900
lots of times.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.810
Previously,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.030
we used two different commands skeet at and get commit.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.770
But we can use shorter way with just one command.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.950
We can run,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.400
get commit Dash A M and then we have to specify the message.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.050
Let's say Styled heading.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.830
So now we added the file to the staging area and made a commit simultaneously.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.090
So this is a shorter way.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.150
But you have to remember that this comment works on before modified and deleted files.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.210
But if you have new files which are no tracked,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.590
this command won't work and have to use previous commands.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.000
I mean,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.190
get at and get committed separately.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.770
All right,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.620
let's add one more commit.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.480
I'm going to add style to the paragraph.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.860
Let's change.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.990
It's called Arrest Ball and then again at the file to the staging area and make commit Ron

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.930
get commit Dash am with the message styled pervert.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.650
Let's look history.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.100
So as you see,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.820
we have lost to commit year and Death Branch is to commits a hat off the master branch.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.320
So now suppose that we're happy with those changes and we want to merge those two branches

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.490
to do that.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.070
First of all,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.150
we have to switch to Master Branch using gate check out.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.970
So at a glance,

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.920
you can notice that styles for heading in paragraph are no longer available.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.440
And also who you run history,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.520
who will get all commits,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.670
which were made on the master branch.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.400
So far.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.030
So now we have to merge those two branches and for that we have to run,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.520
command gets merge and we have to specify the name off the branch death.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.490
So once we run this command than the styles will be displayed and both branches will be

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.880
merged.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.700
If we're around the history,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.310
you will see that now had points to both branches,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.910
master.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.340
And so we have combined to different branches successfully.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.050
And this type of merge is kind of basic one,

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.630
and it is called fast forward merch.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.200
So in the case off fast forward merge.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.810
There is a linear path from the master branch to the second branch,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:11.730
which in our case,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.790
is that brunch.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.000
So this branches created based on the last commit off the master branch.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.610
It means that while we were working on death brunch,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.250
there wasn't added any new commits on massive brunch.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.140
And once we merge,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.660
those two branches then simply commits from Deaf Branch were added after this base

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.350
committed to the master brunch.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.440
So any changes which were made on Death Branch should be applied,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.050
and they will overwrite Old State off the master branch.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.780
And there won't be any conflicts to prove that.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.930
Let's switch back to that brunch,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.940
then change colors off,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:06.390
heading in paragraph and make new commit around.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:13.040
Get commit Desh am with the message updated starts,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:26.460
then go back to the master Branch and march both branches.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.150
Ron gets March death,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.190
so as it seeing now,

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.920
new colors are applied to heading in paragraph,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.750
and the old stars are over written without any conflict.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.600
All right,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.810
so that's the way how we can merge two branches in a fast forward way.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.210
There is another type of merge,

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.710
and regarding that,

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.320
let's talk.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.230
In the last election
