00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910
all right.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.140
So we have already learned some basic stuff regarding gets.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.470
And now in this section,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.940
we're going to be talking about how to undo or discard the things and get throughout.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.040
The section will be referring to some important commence,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.740
such as check out,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.420
revert and reset.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.750
Those commands alot us to go back in time and check older versions off the project.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.010
I mean different snapshots which we have already made,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.230
and also they follow us too many polite on commits.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.520
Okay,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.100
before we move on and start talking about those commence.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.970
First of all,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.220
I want to refer to had Pointer,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.950
which you have all of the scene a couple of videos ago.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.890
All right again,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.960
I'm inside our working get project folder.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.600
Let's display all of our commits,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.350
which we have made so far using kids luck Dash dash one line.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.930
So as the sea Overall we have five different commits and with the 1st 1 which in fact is

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.170
the last commit we see in parentheses had which is a pointer.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.400
And also we see Master,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.170
which is a default brunch.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.640
The brunch itself is a timeline off the commits.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.980
So by default had points to the last commit.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.750
But if we go back to any off the previous states off the project then had will point to the

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.250
relevant committee and you will see it's a in order to prove that had points to the last

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.250
commit by default,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.740
we can run the following command gets show all right and then had.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.380
So,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.160
as you can see,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.570
we got here the last commit with a bunch of information.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.170
I mean,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.330
with Author Date and the message.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.840
Besides that down below,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.560
we see some other stuff to be more precise,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.490
the difference.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.430
But for now,

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.840
I'm not going to refer to eat because it's a subject off different sections.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.910
Now I just want to show you how we can use the head and this guy's had perform the same job

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.410
as I d off a committee can do.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.230
I mean,

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.680
we can run the same gets show command.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.250
And if we pass here the idea of commit instead of head,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.500
by the way,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.940
when you work in git bash and you want to copy something,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.920
you just need to still like the text,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.340
and it will be automatically copied.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.030
So now you see that we got here the same result,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.960
so we're able to use had instead of I D.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.200
But it's interesting.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.410
What can we do if we want to show up?

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.230
Other commits using the head for that,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.300
Let's at first clear the window that look again commits using git log,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.160
dash,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.350
dash one line.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.660
And now let's see how we can access other commits using the head.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.380
Let's say on the 2nd 1 for that we should run,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:03.200
get show that had which should be followed by till the sign and then we have to type one.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.930
So we wrote here one,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.550
but it points to the second committee and the same way works had till the 23 and so on.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.580
So if we press enter,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.050
then the second comet will show up.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.650
Okay,

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.470
so that's all about the had pointer.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.840
We will use it in the future throughout the course.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.620
For now,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.900
let's stop here and move on to the next election
