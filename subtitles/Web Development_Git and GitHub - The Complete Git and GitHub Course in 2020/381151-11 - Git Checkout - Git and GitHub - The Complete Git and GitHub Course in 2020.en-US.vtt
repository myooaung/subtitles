00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
all right.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.750
It's time to start talking about undoing things in gets.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.580
As we said in the previous lecture,

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.310
there are three different commands,

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.870
which hello us to undo things on.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.950
The 1st 1 that I'm going to talking about in this lecture is get check out.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.400
So with help off this command were able to unmodified files.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.160
Also,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.880
we can go back in time and check different states off our project.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.090
It also allows us to move between different branches.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.090
Okay,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.430
let's go ahead and at first see how we can unmodified files before that.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.760
Let's modify files and make some changes in all of our three files.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.590
Let's create a span element inside paragraph with some text that say hi there.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.000
Then go to style.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.050
Don't CSS file Select paragraph and change its color.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.990
Make it green.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.350
And finally,

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.430
let's open this creep.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:08.450
BoJ's file and create another variable cost be equals 100.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.040
All right,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.270
so we have modified or three files.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.680
Let's check the status.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.920
As you can see,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.970
all of our falls are modified.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.180
Now suppose that we accidentally made some error and we need to unmodified the fun.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.760
Let's say script or Js for that we can use the check out command which actually is shown

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.650
here as well.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.250
So if we run gets check out and the file name Script Js,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.150
then the second variable that we have just created will be gone.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.150
And also,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.960
if we check again,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.510
the status screamed.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.050
The Js file will be no longer shown here because now it is unmodified.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.290
So you agree that it's really useful.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.350
If you want to a modify all the files at the same time,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.680
then you can run get checked out with dots,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.450
by the way instead off a dot you can use an asterisk as well.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.520
Okay,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.420
so if we check again the status,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.180
then you will find that our working tree is clean and all the changes that we made are

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.740
discarded.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.490
Okay,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.650
Another job that get check out can do is to go back in time and check the previous states

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.450
off the project.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.220
Unlike other commence such as revert and especially reset,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.290
check out is the safest one.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.760
Because we check out,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.440
we cannot change or delete previous commits.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.630
All right,

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.410
let's look commits using gets look dash,

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.190
dash one line Suppose that you want to go back in time and check out the state off your

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.030
project where we added having in HTML document.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.930
I mean,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.460
let's say we want to check out our project on Lee second committee.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.110
In order to do that,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:12.550
we have to use get check out and then we have to specify the proper I d off the committee.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.340
So let's copy i d and pace it you.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.980
So once we press enter,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.450
we will get the previous state off our project.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.230
As you see script,

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.330
OJ's felt no longer exists.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.870
And here just the tap is opened.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.190
You can see here in parenthesis that file is deleted from disk.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.720
So we just need to close these Top also in HTML file would have just having element and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.150
install dot CSS file style for a program is removed.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.660
Besides that,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.150
you can see here in the terminal the following text you are in detached had state.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.260
It means that had pointer no longer refers to the last commit Also you can see down below

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.780
that instead off the master here is displayed the i d off the committee.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.470
All right,

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:12.540
let's luck commits right gets blawg Dash dash one line as you see just the 1st 2 commits

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.340
are displayed.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.950
It doesn't mean that the rest off the commits are dilated.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.050
We have just moved back in time and we are in the previous state off.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.640
The project,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.720
of course,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.590
now had points to the committee on which we currently are.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.030
Okay,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.340
so that's how we can check the previous state off the project in order to go back.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.450
We need to run,

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.850
get checked out,

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.060
Master.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.030
So you see that script?

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.040
RJ's file is back on.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.250
If we run again,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.550
gets look,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.580
dash,

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.650
dash one line,

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.940
then all our commits will be back and had will point again to the last committee.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.180
So check out is very safe because it is a read on Lee.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.880
You cannot change or added previous commits,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.600
and now I'm going to prove that let's go back again to the previous commit Let's say to the

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.340
2nd 1 right,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.200
get check out and paste your I d.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.860
And now let's try to make a commit.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.960
Let's add in this Talat CSS file color blue,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:35.640
then check the status so the file is modified,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.650
and in order to add it to the staging area,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.450
let's run,

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.570
get and and the file name styled up CSS.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.750
Then again,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.700
check the status.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.460
It is green,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.700
so it is staged.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.370
And finally,

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.840
let's go ahead and make the committee.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.350
Let's run kids commit desh Um,

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.000
And right here the message test committed.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.420
All right,

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.940
so let's lock the commits Ron gets log,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.370
dash,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.180
dash one line You can see that the committee is at it,

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.730
but if we go back using,

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:29.470
get check out muster and then lug commits using gets look,

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.040
dash,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.050
dash one line,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.510
you will find that here.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.170
We don't see that newly created commit.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.330
And also,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:46.360
if we go back again to the previous state using get checked out with I d And then if we run

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.360
,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.950
get luck Dash Dash one line,

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:57.280
you will find that commit no longer exists here as well.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.240
So it means that check out command is just a read on Lee and were not able to change added

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.400
to commit or at the new one in the previous state.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.780
Actually,

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.070
for that we can use other commands like revert or reset,

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.050
which we will discuss in the coming lectures.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.080
But anyway,

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.770
if you want to create a new commit in case off.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.500
Check out.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.450
You can do that by creating other branches,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.470
which you will see later in the course.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.910
All right,

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.040
that's it about Get check out.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.350
Next.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.550
We have to discuss how to undo things.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.190
Using gets revert.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.060
And for that,

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.630
let's move on to the next lecture.
