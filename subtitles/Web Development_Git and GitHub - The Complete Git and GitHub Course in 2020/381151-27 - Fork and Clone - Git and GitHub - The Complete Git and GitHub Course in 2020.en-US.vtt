00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
all right,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.020
so in the last lectures will learn about how to create pull requests,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.580
how to merge branches on get up and also how to deal with emerge conflict.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.480
Now,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.270
as I promised,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:18.480
I'm going to show you how to copy someone else's repository on our get up account and how

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.470
to clone it to our local computer.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.670
So in this lecture we will be looking at forking and cloning on ghetto.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.410
Those two options alot us to get access to any off the open source repositories which are

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.900
available on get up work on them,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.290
make some changes in updates and contribute those updates to the original project.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.670
To proceed with the lecture,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.870
we will need to use the second account.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.910
I have already created a brand new one.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.910
As you see,

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.080
we don't have here any repositories.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.630
I'm going to search for the repository which we have been working on so far,

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.070
and then we will copy it to the newly created account.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.060
So,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.850
first of all,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.910
to work with me along the way,

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.850
let's go ahead and create a brand new account,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.720
or you can feel free and use any other accounts.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.130
If you have one Of course,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.350
once you have access to a different account,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.010
then go ahead and search for our working repository.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.650
In general,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.370
we can search for and use any off the open source repositories which are available on Get

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.640
Him.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.680
But for now,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.570
I'm going to use our repository in order to make things a bit more easy.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.810
I'm going to search for the user name of our previous account because if we search for the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.370
name off the report which is get project,

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.520
we will get tones of results with the same name.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.250
So let's search for the user name.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.850
In my case,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.850
it's code and create web.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.240
But of course,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.400
in your case it should be your user name.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.630
Then click here down below the users.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.290
So here is our user name and the repository as well.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.880
All right,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.850
now we have to copy the repository to our current account.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.980
To do that,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.230
we have to click the button called Fork,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.180
which is placed at the top right side of the page once we click it.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.440
Then after a few seconds,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.350
the entire report story we copied to our new account.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.280
So here it is.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.720
Now we have the exact same copy off the original Repo.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.270
All the source files air here.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.900
Also,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.750
if we go to the commit stop,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.770
we'll find all commits,

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.280
which have been made so far.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.150
So using the fork option,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.240
get help Pelosis to copy the original repository to our account.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.350
If we check out the original report story,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.090
then right after the fourth button will find the number of folks.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.990
In this case,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.770
it's one.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.450
If we click it,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.420
then we'll find the owner off the original report and the user name who forked the report.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.550
All right,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.400
so that's it about four King.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.660
Now I'm going to show you how to clone the repository to our local machine for support.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.180
Let's go to the terminal and create a new folder on desktop.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.250
Currently,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.980
we are in our working folder,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.110
so let's go up one directory for that.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.890
We need to run CD double dots that I'm going to create a new folder for that.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.590
As you remember,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.260
we had to use the command and K d I.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.750
R.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.680
And we have to specify the name off the folder.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.470
That's a get project clone.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.420
So once the folder is created,

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:02.250
let's enter it Now let's go back to a work eat up account.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.680
So to clone the repository,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.170
we have to click this green bottom Here,

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.830
it's called Clone or download wants me.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.450
Click it,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.620
then dealing should be displayed.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.970
Let's go ahead and copied this link.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.730
Then go back to the terminal and round the following command.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.610
Get clothes.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.010
And now we have to paste here the link which we have,

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.690
just call it.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.380
All right,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.570
So the repository is quant.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.000
Let's run l s,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.920
which shows us the files and folders which the current directory consists up.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.230
As you see,

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.970
there is added a new folder called Get Project.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.650
If we answer this folder,

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.330
then we'll find a copy off the original repository.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.890
We have here all the source files and also if we around the history using get locked,

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.220
dash,

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.150
dash more online,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.050
then we will get all the commits that were made on the original repository.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.310
All right,

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.910
so that's the way how we can make a copy off the remote repository to the gate,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.100
have account using a fork and also how to clone the report to your local computer using git

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.440
Clone.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.620
Next,

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.670
I'm going to show you how to contribute to the open source repository.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.010
And for that let's move on to the next lecture
