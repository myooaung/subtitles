00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
all right.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.990
So in the previous lectures we talked about how to merge branches,

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.550
how to sell some merge conflicts using different ways.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:09.880
I mean,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.550
fast forward and three way merge.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.930
And also how to change the base committee using get three base.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.130
Until now,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.930
we have been working locally,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.620
and now it's time to go ahead and work on Geeta.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.250
In this lecture,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.570
I'm going to show you how to merge branches on Get up.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.430
First of all,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.140
let's recall,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.550
What do we have on our remote repository?

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.970
So as you can see,

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.860
we have a couple of commits made previously,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.830
and we have just one branch,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.180
which is a master.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.180
I'm going to go ahead and create a new branch.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.450
As you remember.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.480
We just need to drop down this button here,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.700
then type name off the branch inside of the input field.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.650
Let's call it feature one,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.480
and then we have to click create brunch.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.600
So,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.100
as you see,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.160
we have now to branches.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.740
If we drop down again,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.750
this button will find two different branches,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.210
master and feature one.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.940
All right,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.120
so now the next thing that I'm going to do is to make some commits on that newly created

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.740
branch.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.140
Suppose that we want to add some stars to heading and paragraph.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.310
I'm going to open the style dot CSS file.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.770
Then two added,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.550
This file would have to click this little I can hear,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.880
and after that we will be able to add in the file that's select h one heading elements and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.150
change its color.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.640
Make it,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.110
let's say Green.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.340
Once we added this file,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.120
we have to make a new committee.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:02:00.670
Let's insert here The commit message changed the color off h one and finally click commit

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.350
changes.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.530
All right,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.050
so we have made any commit to the feature one branch successfully,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.120
as you see on the master branch.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.660
Overall,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.910
we have six commits.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.110
But if we switch to the future,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.750
one branch you will find seven commits.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.040
It means that the future one branches one.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.140
Commit ahead off the master brunch.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.440
I'm going to add one more commit.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.520
Let's add it once again,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.650
the style that CSS file and now change the color off the paragraph.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.280
Let's make it blue,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.630
Then don't blow.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.230
Make a new commit with a message changed the color off.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.650
Pete.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.360
All right,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.200
so currently the future on branches to commits ahead of the master branch.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.560
Suppose that we're happy with the changes,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.440
and now we want to merge the future.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.310
One branch to the Master brunch,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.950
As you can see here is displayed a green bottom called Compare and Pull requests.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.690
I'm going to click this button now.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.390
We ended up on a new pitch.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.090
Let's go ahead and describe What do we have here?

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.140
So to merge branches on Get Hub,

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.630
we need to create a pull request.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.470
That's why we see here heading,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.490
saying open April request.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.010
And underneath it,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.000
we can read Create a new pull request by comparing changes across two branches.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.230
So before we merge the branches,

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.790
when you compare the changes between two branches and create a pool request here we see two

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.880
branches master and feature one the branches,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.640
which should be compared next to them.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.500
There is a green check mark,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.630
followed by the text able to merge.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.080
These branches can be automatically merged.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.070
It means that we don't have an emerging conflict,

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.090
and the branches are afraid to march.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.140
Next,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.080
we have some input fields in which you can leave some commons.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.450
Let's interfere updated style that CSS file.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.940
Let's leave the second input field empty down below.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.730
There are displayed the commits which we made on the future One branch.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.770
And at the end of the page you can find the changes that we made to the start.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.690
Artsy is a spot.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.640
Those plus signs indicate the code that we added recently inside of the CSS file.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.080
All right,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.830
so everything is ready to create a pull request to the that.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.320
We just need to click these green bottom few.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.000
Okay,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.850
so we have created the pull request we see here the user name who wants to merge two

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.730
commits into master from feature one branch also down below.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.410
We see this branch has no conflicts with the base branch.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.540
The base branch is the same as the master brunch so we can merge the branches.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.280
Let's collect the bottom merch,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.150
pull request and then click to confirm the merchant.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.990
All right.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.980
So as you can see it,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.620
the pull request is successful.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.720
Emerged and closed and now weaken dilate the branch.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.980
You're all set.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.450
The future.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.780
One branch can be safely deleted.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.030
Let's click this button here.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:33.360
So we have successful emergency changes from the feature one branch to the massive brunch.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.930
If we check the commits,

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.960
history will find three new commits.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.140
The 1st 2 commits described the changes made in the style of CSS file.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.850
As for the last commit,

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.300
it's saying that we merged the pull request from the future.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.080
One brunch.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.350
Okay,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.370
so that's the way how we can merge branches on Get Hub.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.170
In this case,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.650
we have been working on the remote repository from just one account in the real world.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.930
When you want to contribute to someone else's repository,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.590
then you might not have the permission to merge.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.770
The Branches unit is sending people request to the owner off the report,

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.430
who will check the changes and then merge the brunches.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.570
We will discuss all those things a bit later.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.550
But before that,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.080
let's see how to deal with Merche conflicts on Get up in the next lecture
