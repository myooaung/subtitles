00:00:01,570  -->  00:00:06,360
In this tutorial we will set up the foundations of our data flow task.

2

00:00:06,360  -->  00:00:07,990
First it lets her name the stars.

3

00:00:08,040  -->  00:00:14,420
The convention I use is to put the date at the start so that I know when this upload was set up.

4

00:00:14,430  -->  00:00:17,400
Now let's go into the data flow task.

5

00:00:17,400  -->  00:00:22,680
Notice that the SSA s toolbox changes as we enter the data flow task.

6

00:00:22,680  -->  00:00:24,150
Let's have a look at that again.

7

00:00:24,180  -->  00:00:26,870
This is the toolbox when we are in the control flow.

8

00:00:27,060  -->  00:00:29,810
And this is the toolbox when we are in the data flow.

9

00:00:30,420  -->  00:00:36,210
Let's collapse all of the menus in the toolbox ignore favorites and Coleman and you will see that the

10

00:00:36,210  -->  00:00:40,250
remaining three are called sources transforms and destinations.

11

00:00:40,320  -->  00:00:47,730
This in fact represents our e-tail process data is extracted from the sources transformed with the transforms

12

00:00:47,940  -->  00:00:50,360
and loaded into the destinations.

13

00:00:50,640  -->  00:00:56,410
We will be mostly working with sources and destinations and I will explain why and the further down

14

00:00:56,410  -->  00:00:57,460
in the course.

15

00:00:57,780  -->  00:01:04,740
Let's set up our dataflow task go to sources select the flat file source and dragged into a working

16

00:01:04,740  -->  00:01:05,430
area.

17

00:01:05,460  -->  00:01:08,580
This will point to our CSP file with the data.

18

00:01:08,880  -->  00:01:15,300
Next go to destination's and find only D-B destination and also dragged into your workspace.

19

00:01:15,300  -->  00:01:20,520
This will point to a table in our database where we want to load the data into.

20

00:01:20,550  -->  00:01:25,200
You can rename the source and destination if you like but you don't have to.

21

00:01:25,200  -->  00:01:28,980
The last step we need to perform now is to connect the two.

22

00:01:29,010  -->  00:01:34,230
You will notice that there are two arrows coming out of your flat plus or the blue arrow is where the

23

00:01:34,230  -->  00:01:39,550
data goes and the Red Arrow is where any error messages will go.

24

00:01:39,600  -->  00:01:43,600
You need the blue arrow connect the blue hour to destination.

25

00:01:43,790  -->  00:01:48,240
Great you have now prepared the data flow in the next tutorials.

26

00:01:48,240  -->  00:01:53,050
I will show you how to set up the flat file source and the database connections.
