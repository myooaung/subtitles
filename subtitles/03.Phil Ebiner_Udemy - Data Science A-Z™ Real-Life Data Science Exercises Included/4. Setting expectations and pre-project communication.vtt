00:00:00.960  -->  00:00:04.160
Setting expectations and pre project communication.

2

00:00:04.170  -->  00:00:09.300
So once you have identified a business problem that you want to work on that is important enough for

3

00:00:09.300  -->  00:00:10.620
you to invest your time in.

4

00:00:10.890  -->  00:00:15.290
And you you see the challenges that you are faced with.

5

00:00:15.600  -->  00:00:20.580
You definitely have to sit down with the person that you're delivering his project for and tell them

6

00:00:21.030  -->  00:00:25.860
discuss with them the expect the time frames and deadlines and time and checkpoints along the way.

7

00:00:25.860  -->  00:00:31.680
This is basically a project management 101 you got to tell the people that you're doing this project

8

00:00:31.680  -->  00:00:34.050
for when they can expect the result.

9

00:00:34.170  -->  00:00:41.970
And it is important to make them or help them understand that this is not a regular project where everything

10

00:00:41.970  -->  00:00:44.930
is defined and you know exactly what's going to happen.

11

00:00:45.090  -->  00:00:46.110
This is not science.

12

00:00:46.110  -->  00:00:51.780
You have to take into account all the data prep you're going to have to do all the data gathering is

13

00:00:51.780  -->  00:00:54.690
you're going to have to do even interviews with people.

14

00:00:54.720  -->  00:00:58.350
So there's a lot of research that goes on in the initial phase.

15

00:00:58.470  -->  00:01:02.990
So remember that 70 percent of your work at least 70 percent is going to be data cleaning out of prep

16

00:01:03.120  -->  00:01:05.670
and that's only after you actually have the data.

17

00:01:05.820  -->  00:01:09.160
And then after that you're going to have to drive inside's create models and so on.

18

00:01:09.270  -->  00:01:16.110
So data science projects are usually not quick and you have to make this clear to the people that you're

19

00:01:16.110  -->  00:01:21.510
delivering the project for so that their expectations are set and you have to of course you have to

20

00:01:21.540  -->  00:01:28.770
aim to meet deadlines and that's why I always recommend set yourself like ample time give yourself ample

21

00:01:28.770  -->  00:01:33.340
time to meet the deadline is better to under promise and over deliver.

22

00:01:33.390  -->  00:01:36.480
As they say right rather than the opposite right.

23

00:01:36.480  -->  00:01:40.520
So you'd rather set a further deadline and deliver earlier and more.

24

00:01:40.530  -->  00:01:43.830
More often than not you will still barely meet a deadline.

25

00:01:43.830  -->  00:01:52.590
These are quite sophisticated and bold projects that we're talking about and moreover keep your person

26

00:01:52.590  -->  00:01:54.510
the person that you're delivering the Project for.

27

00:01:54.510  -->  00:01:58.590
Keep them updated along the way tell them how you going what challenges you're facing.

28

00:01:58.590  -->  00:02:04.740
Always important to tell them if if are intervention meet the deadline tell them as early as possible

29

00:02:04.770  -->  00:02:11.850
and so that they can move around you know move their requirements around and maybe there'll be extra

30

00:02:11.850  -->  00:02:14.100
room for you to do the project properly.

31

00:02:14.520  -->  00:02:18.600
And another thing that I wanted to mention So this all kind of standard stuff but another thing I wanted

32

00:02:18.600  -->  00:02:23.240
to mention that is very real and true data science is project scope creep.

33

00:02:23.340  -->  00:02:30.360
So the scope creep is the phenomenon when people ask you for one thing and as you do very insightful

34

00:02:30.360  -->  00:02:37.890
on the way there is always going to be more requests for more additional insights or to change a project

35

00:02:37.920  -->  00:02:38.430
and so on.

36

00:02:38.430  -->  00:02:40.420
So that's that's why it's called scope creep.

37

00:02:40.620  -->  00:02:46.920
Well you've got a lot of fight that very very efficiently you're going to of course you are interested

38

00:02:46.920  -->  00:02:49.820
in delivering over and above than what you expected.

39

00:02:49.900  -->  00:02:51.170
Although the other people expected.

40

00:02:51.180  -->  00:02:53.910
But make sure that you talk about it at the start.

41

00:02:53.970  -->  00:03:00.230
You have to warn people that on assigns products that is normal that you find insights that will change

42

00:03:00.260  -->  00:03:06.750
modify more your project and their expectations and requirements and so they have to know in advance

43

00:03:06.750  -->  00:03:11.850
that if that happens then you will need additional time or you'll have to discuss the time frames again

44

00:03:11.880  -->  00:03:14.410
and you will set a different deadline.

45

00:03:14.410  -->  00:03:17.480
So make sure that that expectation is clear.

46

00:03:17.520  -->  00:03:24.120
And if you didn't agree to any scope creep then kind of try to stay away from taking on more and more

47

00:03:24.120  -->  00:03:29.150
work as you go along deliver the main project and then see what you can deliver over and above after

48

00:03:29.190  -->  00:03:29.330
that
