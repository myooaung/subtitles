00:00:01.020  -->  00:00:03.330
How you present executives.

2

00:00:03.330  -->  00:00:07.360
Now the truth is that presenting two executives can be very daunting.

3

00:00:07.470  -->  00:00:12.720
Imagine you walk into a boardroom and there's five or seven of them are sitting there all staring at

4

00:00:12.720  -->  00:00:19.720
you even staring you down and you have to say something of value to them and then waiting for it.

5

00:00:20.100  -->  00:00:21.960
Now be prepared for that.

6

00:00:21.960  -->  00:00:28.500
Be prepared for the fact that it can be a terrifying experience especially for a wince at first sight

7

00:00:28.520  -->  00:00:28.710
.

8

00:00:29.010  -->  00:00:33.850
But at the same time I understand that there are also people that are just people who you're presenting

9

00:00:33.930  -->  00:00:34.190
.

10

00:00:34.620  -->  00:00:36.370
They're very busy people.

11

00:00:36.370  -->  00:00:41.340
They it's very hard to get their attention or I would say on an average like seven minutes more than

12

00:00:41.340  -->  00:00:43.960
seven minutes you're stretching it.

13

00:00:43.980  -->  00:00:48.270
They're very busy people but they are people so just presented them like you would normally be yourself

14

00:00:48.610  -->  00:00:49.150
.

15

00:00:49.520  -->  00:00:51.360
Just just go ahead with your presentation.

16

00:00:51.630  -->  00:00:52.300
You should be fine.

17

00:00:52.320  -->  00:00:56.350
But take into account these falling points executives love dollar amounts.

18

00:00:56.350  -->  00:01:01.350
They they all have budgets and they all need to meet them and they need to understand what are we talking

19

00:01:01.350  -->  00:01:02.070
about.

20

00:01:02.130  -->  00:01:04.900
What is the dollar value on top of that.

21

00:01:04.900  -->  00:01:09.210
So how much will that save the company how much will this earn the company how much is it how much will

22

00:01:09.210  -->  00:01:10.140
this cost the company.

23

00:01:10.140  -->  00:01:10.740
Things like that.

24

00:01:10.740  -->  00:01:15.400
So in your analysis what whatever you find try to quantify in dollar terms.

25

00:01:15.540  -->  00:01:23.820
I know it can be hard sometimes it can be complex to find a translation from say an A customer experience

26

00:01:23.820  -->  00:01:28.190
that you improved into how much dollars that's going to the company but come up with ideas maybe on

27

00:01:28.190  -->  00:01:33.960
which customers will that retain over the course of a year or how many additional new customers are

28

00:01:33.960  -->  00:01:38.450
going to come to company because of that like provide some estimates or don't.

29

00:01:38.460  -->  00:01:44.450
Why didn't have them in your head or read or written down somewhere so you can open them up and explain

30

00:01:44.460  -->  00:01:47.020
if you you're asked that question because you probably will.

31

00:01:47.040  -->  00:01:49.090
How much pressure comes up.

32

00:01:49.350  -->  00:01:52.160
80 percent of the time when you're talking to executives.

33

00:01:52.260  -->  00:01:56.340
The other thing that executives like is drilling all down into detail.

34

00:01:56.340  -->  00:02:04.690
So we were kind of lucky that we're in data science right so rarely you'll have a cheap DOT officer

35

00:02:04.710  -->  00:02:11.680
in an organization and so rarely you'll have somebody very technical on one of the executives who can

36

00:02:11.680  -->  00:02:16.650
drill really drill into the details and plus they wold really have the time to go through all these

37

00:02:16.650  -->  00:02:17.950
technical things with you.

38

00:02:18.240  -->  00:02:25.800
So we're kind of a bit immune in that sense that it's hard to get into the details of data but that

39

00:02:25.800  -->  00:02:31.860
is actually a misconception or like it thought your immune in a sense but at the same time it also adds

40

00:02:31.860  -->  00:02:38.100
a bit and then another layer of complication on top of everything because you have to be able to explain

41

00:02:38.100  -->  00:02:40.320
in detail without going to technical things.

42

00:02:40.320  -->  00:02:45.460
So that's a whole different art form you've got you've got to be prepared that you're going to ask you

43

00:02:45.520  -->  00:02:50.250
detailed questions where the ulcers would normally be technical but you've got to explain them in a

44

00:02:50.280  -->  00:02:56.220
normal human being kind of way so be prepared for that executives really like to dig into details.

45

00:02:56.430  -->  00:02:57.750
And you never know where it's going to go.

46

00:02:57.760  -->  00:03:01.120
Like I get every time I.

47

00:03:01.470  -->  00:03:06.450
I am amazed that you know like you've got this presentation and then they just we were off into one

48

00:03:06.450  -->  00:03:12.600
direction and they all somehow agree were on on the fact that you've got to we were off veer off into

49

00:03:12.900  -->  00:03:18.120
this this direction and they keep asking you questions about that so you really can't prepare for everything

50

00:03:18.130  -->  00:03:18.170
.

51

00:03:18.210  -->  00:03:21.480
But try but try to prepare for everything.

52

00:03:21.570  -->  00:03:24.500
Executives will ask those questions.

53

00:03:24.710  -->  00:03:25.260
That's the thing.

54

00:03:25.250  -->  00:03:28.780
On certain terms of questions I've got I've got a note here.

55

00:03:29.400  -->  00:03:32.100
Make like this is this a tip for you.

56

00:03:32.100  -->  00:03:36.990
So if you've got a presentation and there's something obvious in your presentation I would say like

57

00:03:37.050  -->  00:03:38.000
a flight chart.

58

00:03:38.010  -->  00:03:40.130
And then there's a spike somewhere.

59

00:03:40.140  -->  00:03:44.100
But at the same time that Spike is not the focus of your presentation you're talking about something

60

00:03:44.100  -->  00:03:49.830
else this is just like an exhilarate chart that is talking about something that is assisting your final

61

00:03:49.830  -->  00:03:50.550
conclusion.

62

00:03:50.760  -->  00:03:55.200
Well what you can do is you can leave out the explanation of that spike.

63

00:03:55.200  -->  00:04:01.250
So instead of like an on the wrong person would obviously talk about that spike and I would say because

64

00:04:01.260  -->  00:04:05.520
the anomaly would explain all that that happened because it was a weekend and we didn't have enough

65

00:04:05.520  -->  00:04:09.450
data or or those of the public hold they are something good.

66

00:04:09.690  -->  00:04:11.370
So if you leave it out.

67

00:04:11.670  -->  00:04:16.770
What that creates is it creates an opportunity for somebody to ask that question and because it's so

68

00:04:16.800  -->  00:04:19.410
obvious it's probably going to be the first question.

69

00:04:19.530  -->  00:04:20.630
And how does that help.

70

00:04:20.640  -->  00:04:26.220
Well it helps in the sense that it will get the Kewney going it will get people asking questions and

71

00:04:26.220  -->  00:04:27.000
getting engaged.

72

00:04:27.060  -->  00:04:30.890
And you like you don't want to end your presentation.

73

00:04:30.900  -->  00:04:32.410
And for there to be silence.

74

00:04:32.420  -->  00:04:32.910
Right.

75

00:04:33.210  -->  00:04:37.580
Unless unless it's it's like a procession to a large audience where you're not expected to meet with

76

00:04:37.620  -->  00:04:40.480
executives you usually want a Q and A afterwards.

77

00:04:40.650  -->  00:04:46.860
So for them to be like and get to show you that they were engaged in your presentation and you actually

78

00:04:46.860  -->  00:04:51.990
did deliver value you got their interests and a good way to do that is if you leave out something obvious

79

00:04:51.990  -->  00:04:53.490
that they're definitely going to ask.

80

00:04:53.760  -->  00:04:55.560
You can and then they will ask.

81

00:04:55.560  -->  00:04:59.340
And that means the first question is there you're answering and other people are thinking about other

82

00:04:59.340  -->  00:05:03.350
questions and gets that live like a live Q&A like that going.

83

00:05:04.170  -->  00:05:08.170
So those are my tips in terms of presenting it to executives.

84

00:05:08.340  -->  00:05:10.070
Make sure you know your dollar amounts.

85

00:05:10.110  -->  00:05:11.640
Make sure you know your details.

86

00:05:11.640  -->  00:05:15.850
Maybe leave out something so that you can get the Q&A going.

87

00:05:15.930  -->  00:05:21.860
Be prepared that it might be a daunting experience but at the same time they're just people so you know

88

00:05:21.900  -->  00:05:26.230
you'll be fine after a couple times you'll get comfortable presenting to.
