1

00:00:00,900  -->  00:00:03,330
The various tutorial we added a reference a chart.

2

00:00:03,360  -->  00:00:09,400
And today we're going to start replicating this chart and analyzing other categories.

3

00:00:09,480  -->  00:00:12,930
So it's very easy to replicate this AB test.

4

00:00:12,930  -->  00:00:19,530
All you have to do is right click your tablet here and click duplicate sheet and I'll rename it right

5

00:00:19,530  -->  00:00:21,880
away because we'll be analyzing country.

6

00:00:22,500  -->  00:00:30,720
And this framework that I have shown you here it actually is very simple to alter for different calcifications

7

00:00:30,720  -->  00:00:31,080
.

8

00:00:31,080  -->  00:00:36,360
And the beauty of it is that over here we only have gender one time and a whole tab as you can see it's

9

00:00:36,360  -->  00:00:39,440
not in the marks it's not in the rows only in the columns.

10

00:00:39,480  -->  00:00:45,000
So whenever we want to change a category all you have to do is drag a new category on top of gender

11

00:00:45,000  -->  00:00:45,790
and replace it.

12

00:00:45,990  -->  00:00:52,080
So in this case we're talking about geography track geography replace gender and let's make some room

13

00:00:52,590  -->  00:00:54,180
and bam it's all done.

14

00:00:54,180  -->  00:00:58,470
We've got our reference line we've got our labels we've got our percentages.

15

00:00:58,470  -->  00:01:00,460
Everything has been done for you.

16

00:01:00,460  -->  00:01:06,310
So you see how quickly it is and this is why I am a big fan of data mining through Tablo.

17

00:01:06,510  -->  00:01:10,840
You can talk to your daughter and it just happens like lightning fast.

18

00:01:11,010  -->  00:01:13,370
And so here right away you can see what's going on.

19

00:01:13,410  -->  00:01:18,180
OK so Germany people in Germany are exiting the bank at a rapid rate.

20

00:01:18,180  -->  00:01:24,430
Thirty two percent of customers in Germany left over the period of the observation.

21

00:01:24,660  -->  00:01:26,820
And France and Spain are below average.

22

00:01:26,850  -->  00:01:32,310
Once again it makes sense that these jobs will average because they're equal at approximately equal

23

00:01:32,330  -->  00:01:36,180
and or this other one is above average so they have to be below.

24

00:01:36,390  -->  00:01:42,480
So right away from here we've got some inside's we can you know run to the executives or to your manager

25

00:01:42,480  -->  00:01:44,570
and say hey something's going on in Germany.

26

00:01:44,580  -->  00:01:46,720
Germany maybe there's a competitor there.

27

00:01:46,800  -->  00:01:49,590
Maybe the products are not suitable for the market.

28

00:01:49,590  -->  00:01:55,710
Maybe there's some sort of new legislation something is going on and you can already start digging into

29

00:01:55,710  -->  00:01:56,950
this deeper.

30

00:01:57,240  -->  00:02:02,280
That's how we do the this is not an AB test anymore because there's three categories so this would be

31

00:02:02,280  -->  00:02:08,760
an A B C test or you can just call it like a classification test or categorization test or something

32

00:02:08,760  -->  00:02:09,220
like that.

33

00:02:09,390  -->  00:02:14,970
But you kind of get the picture that we can see that there is an anomaly something is going on in Germany

34

00:02:15,300  -->  00:02:18,910
and that is exactly what we're looking for through this process.

35

00:02:19,080  -->  00:02:25,170
We're interrogating the data to look for anomalies and once we find them we can investigate them further

36

00:02:25,440  -->  00:02:27,480
and take them to the next level.

37

00:02:27,480  -->  00:02:29,830
So now what we want to do is do another one.

38

00:02:29,960  -->  00:02:32,250
It's so quick and easy why don't we do a couple more.

39

00:02:32,280  -->  00:02:39,240
So let's Right-Click country and duplicate sheet and let's look at another variable so I'm not going

40

00:02:39,240  -->  00:02:40,030
to name it for now.

41

00:02:40,050  -->  00:02:46,590
Let's select a variable here we've got some some measures so actual numeric variables.

42

00:02:46,830  -->  00:02:53,100
And here we also have some categorical variables that happen to be in measures like has credit card

43

00:02:53,400  -->  00:02:55,850
that is a 1 and 0 flag.

44

00:02:55,860  -->  00:02:56,160
Right.

45

00:02:56,160  -->  00:03:01,360
So we need to change it into dimension we don't need it as a number.

46

00:03:01,470  -->  00:03:08,610
So let's drag it has credit card in two dimensions and let's now drag has credit card on top of geography

47

00:03:08,610  -->  00:03:09,460
.

48

00:03:09,510  -->  00:03:17,790
Once you've done that what do we see here that in fact there isn't a much of a difference between has

49

00:03:17,790  -->  00:03:19,210
credit card yes or no.

50

00:03:19,230  -->  00:03:24,240
And once again here you can see the aliases are not fixed up so let's do that.

51

00:03:24,240  -->  00:03:28,270
Let's go to his credit card and create some aliases.

52

00:03:28,410  -->  00:03:34,110
So here we can say has credit card so 0 would be a no.

53

00:03:34,380  -->  00:03:37,240
And this would be a yes and OK.

54

00:03:37,260  -->  00:03:44,610
So here we can see that 20 of the people that have a credit card 20 percent left the company and the

55

00:03:44,610  -->  00:03:46,230
people don't have a credit card.

56

00:03:46,250  -->  00:03:48,110
Twenty one percent left the company.

57

00:03:48,300  -->  00:03:50,130
And why say that there's no big difference.

58

00:03:50,130  -->  00:03:52,480
Well because the difference is only one percent.

59

00:03:52,590  -->  00:03:57,250
And more importantly remember that this is not a full fledged statistical AB test.

60

00:03:57,360  -->  00:04:02,750
And if you do run the statistical Abts then little differences like that when there's only a 1 percent

61

00:04:02,760  -->  00:04:03,960
difference.

62

00:04:04,000  -->  00:04:08,850
They require a very large sample size to be statistically significant.

63

00:04:09,240  -->  00:04:11,240
And in our case it's only 8000 people.

64

00:04:11,280  -->  00:04:13,760
So you could check and take this further.

65

00:04:13,800  -->  00:04:20,850
But my point here is that this is not your best investment of time.

66

00:04:20,940  -->  00:04:27,240
You would much rather look at country or gender because their differences are massive and there you

67

00:04:27,240  -->  00:04:34,320
can actually have a impact and maybe make some business rules of business decisions around what you're

68

00:04:34,320  -->  00:04:36,990
going to do to fix the problem.

69

00:04:37,180  -->  00:04:41,510
And this case there's not much to fix there is you know only a 1 percent difference.

70

00:04:41,520  -->  00:04:50,610
So now we're going to rename the Stabb to has credit card and let's do one more so let's look at our

71

00:04:50,610  -->  00:04:57,780
verbals we've got is active member here so people who have been active in the past couple of months

72

00:04:58,650  -->  00:05:02,060
have the bank can determine that in different ways.

73

00:05:02,160  -->  00:05:07,260
So it can be whether a person has logged in in the past three months on to the online banking whether

74

00:05:07,260  -->  00:05:11,970
they've made a transaction in the past month or so and the period can be different.

75

00:05:11,970  -->  00:05:15,830
So there's a number of ways this can be determined but since we have this call them let's work with

76

00:05:15,840  -->  00:05:16,240
it.

77

00:05:16,500  -->  00:05:21,140
We're going to take this column and I'm going to convert to dimensional sure.

78

00:05:21,150  -->  00:05:26,640
Another way you can do it here and sort of Dragon Age you can just right click and say convert to dimension

79

00:05:26,640  -->  00:05:27,210
.

80

00:05:27,210  -->  00:05:30,910
Now we have this has created is active member here.

81

00:05:31,020  -->  00:05:34,740
Let's duplicate Oh she just read it like we did before.

82

00:05:34,770  -->  00:05:40,930
Right away we can rename it because we know what we're investigating is active member.

83

00:05:41,190  -->  00:05:46,740
And once again our beautiful framework allows us to just take his active member and replace it here

84

00:05:46,740  -->  00:05:48,240
in columns.

85

00:05:48,240  -->  00:05:49,800
And what do we see here.

86

00:05:50,100  -->  00:05:52,030
So once again let's do that.

87

00:05:52,080  -->  00:05:59,150
Alias's right away so that we can analyze properly is active member 0 usually means No.

88

00:05:59,190  -->  00:06:01,940
1 means yes click OK.

89

00:06:02,100  -->  00:06:10,650
So what do we see people who are not active members of them 27 percent left the company in the period

90

00:06:10,650  -->  00:06:17,330
of observation and 14 percent or only 14 percent of active members left the company.

91

00:06:17,430  -->  00:06:19,970
So this is above average is below average.

92

00:06:20,190  -->  00:06:21,720
And what does that tell us.

93

00:06:21,720  -->  00:06:27,840
Well it kind of backs our intuition right here that people who are active who are actively using your

94

00:06:27,840  -->  00:06:34,860
bag they are less likely to leave their you know they're invested into a bank they maybe like your products

95

00:06:34,860  -->  00:06:36,990
they keep plugging in they keep checking the balance.

96

00:06:36,990  -->  00:06:38,370
Why would they want to leave.

97

00:06:38,370  -->  00:06:42,780
Of course some of them will leave because you know competitors and maybe they have better offer somewhere

98

00:06:42,780  -->  00:06:45,330
else find better offer somewhere else.

99

00:06:45,330  -->  00:06:50,810
Maybe they're consolidating their accounts but people who are not active are at higher risk of leaving

100

00:06:50,810  -->  00:06:50,860
.

101

00:06:50,860  -->  00:06:55,330
That makes sense if somebody hasn't logged into your bank online banking for three months.

102

00:06:55,410  -->  00:07:00,540
He's a major suspect to leave your bank maybe Israeli banking with somebody else or somebody who hasn't

103

00:07:01,070  -->  00:07:07,140
usually does a transaction sometimes a transaction per month or a couple transaction has stopped doing

104

00:07:07,140  -->  00:07:07,590
that.

105

00:07:07,590  -->  00:07:12,560
Then once again there is a higher chance that this person is going to leave.

106

00:07:12,570  -->  00:07:13,380
So there we go.

107

00:07:13,380  -->  00:07:19,500
We've created so far for tests and took us just a couple of minutes so we've got gender.

108

00:07:19,590  -->  00:07:22,810
We can see that female customers are higher Liska a risk of leaving.

109

00:07:23,010  -->  00:07:26,910
Germany is at a higher risk of leaving people who have credit cards.

110

00:07:26,910  -->  00:07:28,380
That doesn't really affect.

111

00:07:28,410  -->  00:07:36,540
It's not a important variable in this situation and is active member people who are not active are more

112

00:07:36,540  -->  00:07:38,490
likely to leave.

113

00:07:38,490  -->  00:07:45,750
So what I wanted to suggest for us moving forward is we've got one more categorical variable here and

114

00:07:45,840  -->  00:07:50,790
that one is number of products so how many products does the person have with the bank.

115

00:07:50,790  -->  00:07:54,130
Does he only have a savings account does he have a savings and a credit card.

116

00:07:54,180  -->  00:07:55,890
Does he have a loan and so on.

117

00:07:55,890  -->  00:08:02,820
So I wanted to suggest that you practice with that variable and do it as homework before our next tutorial

118

00:08:02,820  -->  00:08:04,930
so just create another AB test.

119

00:08:05,010  -->  00:08:12,060
But this time for a number of products and see if you can find any anomalies see if you're if what you

120

00:08:12,060  -->  00:08:19,530
see actually backs your intuition and you create an alias and just have a look and investigate that

121

00:08:19,530  -->  00:08:25,520
verbal and then you'll get back to it in the next to Tauriel and I will show you how I created the same

122

00:08:25,690  -->  00:08:30,170
test although his it's very simple very straightforward just like the ones we did here.

123

00:08:30,240  -->  00:08:31,300
I'm sure you'll go fine.

124

00:08:31,320  -->  00:08:33,470
And I look forward to seeing in the next tutorial.

125

00:08:33,480  -->  00:08:35,150
Until then happy analyzing
