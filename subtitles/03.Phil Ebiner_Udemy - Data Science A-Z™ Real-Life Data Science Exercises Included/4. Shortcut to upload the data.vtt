00:00:00.310  -->  00:00:06.720
And this tutorial I'll show you a shortcut to uploading your daughter to school server so let's get

2

00:00:06.720  -->  00:00:08.110
straight to it.

3

00:00:08.160  -->  00:00:11.380
This is as secure all Server Management Studio.

4

00:00:11.700  -->  00:00:16.330
And this is our folder with Aldara.

5

00:00:16.380  -->  00:00:21.570
So I'm going to go into the Produkt folder go to original datums is going to take the data from here

6

00:00:21.570  -->  00:00:21.950
.

7

00:00:21.950  -->  00:00:27.030
Copy it into prepared data I'm not going to make any notifications and I'm also going to copy it into

8

00:00:27.090  -->  00:00:31.190
the folder for today from where I will upload it.

9

00:00:31.290  -->  00:00:39.000
Now instead of going through this as I'm going to use a very cheap and fast method which I strongly

10

00:00:39.210  -->  00:00:45.710
advise you not to ever use on real projects we'll talk about why later at the end of this tutorial.

11

00:00:45.720  -->  00:00:49.690
But it's definitely not advised to use it on real projects.

12

00:00:49.770  -->  00:00:50.020
OK.

13

00:00:50.040  -->  00:00:53.880
So I want uploaded to this database as training.

14

00:00:53.880  -->  00:00:59.870
So I'm going to Right-Click the database and I'm going to go to tasks here.

15

00:00:59.880  -->  00:01:05.290
I will select import data at the bottom.

16

00:01:05.790  -->  00:01:11.850
Now a wizard pops up which is called the SDL server import and export wizard.

17

00:01:11.850  -->  00:01:13.460
Now we're going to click here.

18

00:01:13.500  -->  00:01:18.700
Next the data source you need to select flat file source.

19

00:01:19.110  -->  00:01:21.440
Then you need to remember this window.

20

00:01:21.780  -->  00:01:26.220
Yep it's very similar to the one we saw in SOSIAS.

21

00:01:26.220  -->  00:01:35.430
Here we will navigate to all project skill practice data sets upload a dorm this folder of files a list

22

00:01:35.430  -->  00:01:40.560
of orders text qualifier as usual call them names.

23

00:01:40.560  -->  00:01:42.350
That's correct.

24

00:01:42.600  -->  00:01:43.700
Columns.

25

00:01:44.010  -->  00:01:48.570
Just check your columns quickly advanced.

26

00:01:49.170  -->  00:01:56.010
As previously we're going to give them a thousand characters in each column.

27

00:01:56.010  -->  00:02:03.630
By the way here if you ever need to you can specify the data type but I will show you how to convert

28

00:02:03.630  -->  00:02:04.310
data types in.

29

00:02:04.340  -->  00:02:08.010
SAGAL So we're just gonna upload them as text preview.

30

00:02:08.010  -->  00:02:09.480
Once again check.

31

00:02:09.690  -->  00:02:10.280
All good.

32

00:02:10.320  -->  00:02:11.280
Next.

33

00:02:11.280  -->  00:02:11.520
All right.

34

00:02:11.520  -->  00:02:14.130
Here you need where you're going to upload the data.

35

00:02:14.520  -->  00:02:17.640
This would be funny flat file source to flood the situation.

36

00:02:17.670  -->  00:02:18.540
Now we don't need that.

37

00:02:18.540  -->  00:02:22.750
We need Microsoft all the D-B provider for a SQL Server.

38

00:02:22.860  -->  00:02:24.060
So I like that.

39

00:02:24.180  -->  00:02:29.430
Make sure your server name is in here your database is in here it should be because you're right click

40

00:02:29.760  -->  00:02:32.670
the right database the one you want to upload to.

41

00:02:32.670  -->  00:02:37.080
Once again your authentication is specified here next.

42

00:02:37.110  -->  00:02:37.830
OK.

43

00:02:37.980  -->  00:02:42.930
Next run immediately you're going to click Finish but I'll just click next here.

44

00:02:42.960  -->  00:02:44.800
Finish is going.

45

00:02:44.850  -->  00:02:49.870
It's done four thousand rows close and all this refresh.

46

00:02:50.190  -->  00:02:54.570
And there you go there's this divorce so select top 1000 rows.

47

00:02:54.570  -->  00:02:58.230
That's how you quickly upload data to Ezekiel search.

48

00:02:58.590  -->  00:03:01.050
I'm not going to do that for the second file in this video.

49

00:03:01.050  -->  00:03:05.900
I'll do it separately but please go ahead and upload the second file this way as well.

50

00:03:06.150  -->  00:03:12.140
Why you should use this specific process to upload data for your data size projects.

51

00:03:12.150  -->  00:03:17.670
Dancers are very simple you're basically missing out on your whole first part of the e-tail process

52

00:03:17.690  -->  00:03:17.830
.

53

00:03:18.030  -->  00:03:21.910
On phase one and phase 2 way you do the data wrangling before the load.

54

00:03:22.140  -->  00:03:29.520
And then when you do the data wrangling and transformations in Sosias that's sambal that's the reasonable

55

00:03:29.520  -->  00:03:35.880
one reason number two is you don't have any traceability or or the ability of what's going on so you

56

00:03:35.880  -->  00:03:42.420
don't have this whole Sosias package that you can later go back to and inspect and understand how you

57

00:03:42.750  -->  00:03:47.080
dissect it and what you did with the data.

58

00:03:47.130  -->  00:03:48.970
It is a requirement.

59

00:03:48.990  -->  00:03:55.140
I believe it's a requirement for proper data science project to have that traceability of your actions

60

00:03:55.170  -->  00:03:55.810
throughout.

61

00:03:55.830  -->  00:04:02.790
So somebody else can pick up your work and repeated or redo it or analyze it or quality assured and

62

00:04:02.790  -->  00:04:03.320
so on.

63

00:04:03.510  -->  00:04:11.970
So definitely use this method only if you need to practice on something or you need to quickly upload

64

00:04:11.970  -->  00:04:14.990
an ad hoc table just to check something out.

65

00:04:15.510  -->  00:04:16.350
So that's it for today.

66

00:04:16.350  -->  00:04:19.740
I'll see you in the next tutorial where we'll start learning Escurial
