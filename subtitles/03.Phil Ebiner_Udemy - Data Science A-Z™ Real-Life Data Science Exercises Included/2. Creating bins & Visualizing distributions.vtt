00:00:00.960  -->  00:00:06.840
Today we're going to continue working our data mining workbook which contains the bank churn data set

2

00:00:06.840  -->  00:00:07.160
.

3

00:00:07.200  -->  00:00:12.580
However we will start looking at a bit of a different rule.

4

00:00:12.630  -->  00:00:15.560
Subtle looking at our daughter from a bit of a different angle.

5

00:00:15.930  -->  00:00:23.280
Let's create a new work tap and this one will call and well we won't call it anything yet.

6

00:00:23.280  -->  00:00:30.690
What we want to visualize here is we want to understand how our customers are distributed by age so

7

00:00:31.020  -->  00:00:35.260
our old customers predominately older or younger what age groups are they in.

8

00:00:35.370  -->  00:00:36.240
And so on.

9

00:00:36.690  -->  00:00:39.510
And as you can see we already have an age variable here.

10

00:00:39.810  -->  00:00:43.900
So the first thing that comes to mind is let's say age and drag it into columns.

11

00:00:44.110  -->  00:00:47.240
And now let's take number of records and drag it into rows.

12

00:00:47.490  -->  00:00:52.860
And now we have one big dot over here at the top.

13

00:00:52.860  -->  00:00:54.100
Why do we have one big dog.

14

00:00:54.120  -->  00:01:04.260
Because well what happened is Tablo took some of Age of all of your customers and it got just over 380000

15

00:01:04.260  -->  00:01:09.840
years and then it took some more records so the toll on them are at it's 10000.

16

00:01:09.840  -->  00:01:14.400
Before we continue I'm just going to fix up the format here so we can see better.

17

00:01:15.330  -->  00:01:21.800
So you can see here three eighty thousand not for 90000 and 10000 customers.

18

00:01:21.810  -->  00:01:23.370
So how do we avoid doing that.

19

00:01:23.370  -->  00:01:30.690
Well in my course on Tablo I talk about aggregation and granularity.

20

00:01:30.690  -->  00:01:32.330
We won't go into details about that yet.

21

00:01:32.340  -->  00:01:34.880
I'll just show you how to avoid this happening.

22

00:01:34.890  -->  00:01:43.470
So if you go to some age and you just change this from a measure to a dimension then what will happen

23

00:01:43.470  -->  00:01:47.250
is it's not aggregating age anymore it's using it as a dimension.

24

00:01:47.280  -->  00:01:52.430
And as you can see you've got this nice shape of a curve.

25

00:01:52.680  -->  00:01:59.430
So basically it just tells you how many customers at every given age they are and it's uploading it

26

00:01:59.430  -->  00:02:00.890
with a line.

27

00:02:00.900  -->  00:02:07.170
So that's good but the problem here is that this is a nice data set so I'm going to Right-Click and

28

00:02:07.170  -->  00:02:12.180
I'll show you the data such if you Right-Click a data set up here and click your data and you go in

29

00:02:12.180  -->  00:02:15.110
here you will see the details of your data.

30

00:02:15.360  -->  00:02:16.930
So there we go.

31

00:02:16.930  -->  00:02:17.900
There's age.

32

00:02:18.150  -->  00:02:23.250
So here you can see that this is a nice data set in the sense that age has been around for you in a

33

00:02:23.250  -->  00:02:30.250
way it's not good because you don't have the details how exactly how old the person is is he for 29

34

00:02:30.250  -->  00:02:34.890
years between nine and a half or Z 29 and 11 months and a couple of days old.

35

00:02:34.890  -->  00:02:41.520
So you don't have that decimal point you can tell how exactly all the Is and therefore you've lost some

36

00:02:41.520  -->  00:02:44.090
information but on the other hand you can't do anything about it.

37

00:02:44.100  -->  00:02:49.170
If this is how the data said was provided to well then you've got to work on it and you might as well

38

00:02:49.170  -->  00:02:54.990
just enjoy it because that means it's a nice data set and you have one less thing to worry about you

39

00:02:54.990  -->  00:02:57.120
don't have the decimal point to worry about.

40

00:02:57.120  -->  00:02:59.320
So what does that say to us.

41

00:02:59.340  -->  00:03:06.230
Well that says to us that yes in this case because they're rounded you Tablo will be able to group customers

42

00:03:06.240  -->  00:03:10.860
for instance there's a person who's 36 and there is a person who's 36 and there's a person who is 36

43

00:03:11.220  -->  00:03:16.520
and there's a couple more people who are 36 and then you go to this chart and then you find 46.

44

00:03:16.550  -->  00:03:24.240
Let me just close this and you find 36 and you find that there's is 456 people that have thirty six

45

00:03:24.540  -->  00:03:26.470
in that column.

46

00:03:26.550  -->  00:03:33.090
What you will find is with other data sets when it's not rounded for you then you'll have people who

47

00:03:33.090  -->  00:03:34.170
are three six and a half.

48

00:03:34.170  -->  00:03:38.640
You'll have the people of thirty six point to thirty six point three and that will cause this charge

49

00:03:38.640  -->  00:03:45.030
to go to create very strange patterns because you might have a lot of people who have three six and

50

00:03:45.390  -->  00:03:51.600
a half but you might have very few people or three 6.6 so it will be very spiky and you don't want that

51

00:03:51.600  -->  00:03:53.340
in your body you can really see a spike over here.

52

00:03:53.340  -->  00:03:54.410
This is not normal right.

53

00:03:54.420  -->  00:04:00.820
So 30 29 and then 31 so 348 people foreign for people on this island.

54

00:04:00.870  -->  00:04:06.170
Just you know just so happened maybe these people are about to turn 30 or these people just turned 31

55

00:04:06.570  -->  00:04:10.280
and therefore you have this spike and you'll see a lot more of them.

56

00:04:10.290  -->  00:04:15.810
If your daughter is I would say more proper in the sense it's more precise.

57

00:04:15.960  -->  00:04:17.530
So you have to find a way around that.

58

00:04:17.550  -->  00:04:24.360
And we have to find a way to visualize our distribution of age regardless of the way our daughter is

59

00:04:24.360  -->  00:04:25.280
presented to us.

60

00:04:25.320  -->  00:04:32.760
And this is where we can use bins. This is where bin's come in and this is where we start thinking about

61

00:04:32.850  -->  00:04:37.970
converting our numeric variables to categorical variables in two dimensions.

62

00:04:38.160  -->  00:04:40.920
So let's start by having a look at that.

63

00:04:40.950  -->  00:04:46.820
I'm going to Right-Click age and what I want to do is I want to group people into bands.

64

00:04:46.950  -->  00:04:53.730
So I want to group people into for instance 5 year bans anybody between 20 and 25 will go into one group

65

00:04:53.730  -->  00:04:56.190
of 25 to 30 will go to the next group and so on.

66

00:04:56.430  -->  00:05:02.490
Well it's very easy to do it and Tablo all you have to go do is right click your variable and then here

67

00:05:02.550  -->  00:05:06.700
select Create and then select bins.

68

00:05:07.140  -->  00:05:12.460
And here you want an age been so we don't want size to be 10 one size to be five.

69

00:05:12.510  -->  00:05:17.470
So every five years there'll be a new bin will click OK.

70

00:05:17.850  -->  00:05:20.030
And here you can see Age state as a measure.

71

00:05:20.040  -->  00:05:24.160
But now we have a dimension which is also age but it's called Age been.

72

00:05:24.540  -->  00:05:29.190
And now what we'll do is we'll take age pin and will drag it in to replace age.

73

00:05:29.970  -->  00:05:35.460
Well actually I need to take age out and then put age and been there because one's a dimension that

74

00:05:35.460  -->  00:05:41.400
is a measure and what you can see right away is a nice distribution just like the ones we are used to

75

00:05:42.000  -->  00:05:46.130
seeing in economics and in mathematics because what happened here.

76

00:05:46.170  -->  00:05:53.730
We've grouped our records by category or by these bins and the bins are acting as categories so just

77

00:05:53.730  -->  00:06:01.440
like let's say gender or the country that people live in a similar way so it's not a recognisable is

78

00:06:01.440  -->  00:06:06.930
no longer recognising these as numbers these are categories so people in this category are between 20

79

00:06:06.930  -->  00:06:10.980
and 25 people in this category between 25 and 30 by the way.

80

00:06:10.980  -->  00:06:18.300
It includes the starting numbers so starting from 25 up to the last number before 30 in our case it's

81

00:06:18.300  -->  00:06:27.720
29 so 25 29 30 to 34 35 to 39 and so on and right away you can see how many people they are in each

82

00:06:27.720  -->  00:06:29.550
of these categories.

83

00:06:29.760  -->  00:06:31.850
So what else would we want to do here.

84

00:06:31.860  -->  00:06:37.700
Maybe let's give it a color so it looks a bit more pleasant.

85

00:06:38.040  -->  00:06:42.540
Let's take some number records hold down control and ragged on to color.

86

00:06:42.550  -->  00:06:45.140
Personally I use green for money.

87

00:06:45.190  -->  00:06:48.810
So let's use a different color.

88

00:06:48.840  -->  00:06:52.970
How about we go with kind of a brownish color.

89

00:06:53.590  -->  00:07:00.690
Something that apply and maybe we want to add a label as well so we don't have to visually check every

90

00:07:00.690  -->  00:07:03.590
single time where this is sitting.

91

00:07:03.750  -->  00:07:09.960
So we'll go and use some number of records as a label as well.

92

00:07:10.080  -->  00:07:11.650
And now you can see that.

93

00:07:11.880  -->  00:07:15.510
Exactly how many people you have in each of these categories.

94

00:07:15.540  -->  00:07:22.980
So and this approach allows you to assess your daughter a bit more so now you understand from this sample

95

00:07:22.980  -->  00:07:28.860
which is quite a significant sample 10000 people in the sample So it's very representative of the overall

96

00:07:28.860  -->  00:07:35.480
population of this bank and what you can see is that most people are age 35 to 40.

97

00:07:35.670  -->  00:07:42.060
Quite a few people between 30 to 40 so basically this is telling you what is the demographic of the

98

00:07:42.060  -->  00:07:43.290
bank like they are.

99

00:07:43.460  -->  00:07:53.760
Let's say more younger people say in their 30s that most customers are presented by age groups between

100

00:07:53.760  -->  00:07:55.590
30 and 45.

101

00:07:55.590  -->  00:07:59.550
So you have the most of your customers are in those age groups.

102

00:07:59.550  -->  00:08:05.100
And in fact if you want to see the percentages you can easily convert this so you can just go here and

103

00:08:05.250  -->  00:08:08.220
add table calculation like we did previously.

104

00:08:08.220  -->  00:08:11.040
You can even at a quick table calculation in this case.

105

00:08:11.040  -->  00:08:13.190
So you just need a percent of total.

106

00:08:13.380  -->  00:08:16.150
And there you go so you have the exact percentages.

107

00:08:16.170  -->  00:08:25.060
This gives you 43 plus 43 plus 16 gives you 59 or 59 plus.

108

00:08:25.200  -->  00:08:32.740
There's like a percentage so that gives you 60 percent 60 percent of your customers are in these H-back

109

00:08:33.030  -->  00:08:35.370
age bands and the rest there's like a long tail.

110

00:08:35.370  -->  00:08:39.440
So this is a right skewed distribution.

111

00:08:39.480  -->  00:08:46.560
So that is a thing to remember as well so maybe another tip that when that skewed means where the tail

112

00:08:46.560  -->  00:08:50.280
is going if the tells going to the right then it's a right skewed.

113

00:08:50.280  -->  00:08:55.260
This is not a left skewed a lot of people get it wrong left skewed would be if the tail was going to

114

00:08:55.260  -->  00:09:01.590
the left so that's a statistical term to keep in mind it's a rice food distribution got a long tail

115

00:09:01.590  -->  00:09:04.050
to the right you and have customers at 90 years old.

116

00:09:04.350  -->  00:09:07.390
And so what are we going to do now.

117

00:09:07.470  -->  00:09:11.560
That's that's pretty much what we want to do with this chart.

118

00:09:11.580  -->  00:09:15.480
I'll just say one quick thing you can change the bins very easily.

119

00:09:15.750  -->  00:09:20.800
You can just go to age and then you go to Edit.

120

00:09:21.060  -->  00:09:24.470
And here let's say we want a 10 year band.

121

00:09:24.810  -->  00:09:31.170
See right away it's changed and now you can see that you got most customers between 30 and 40 and then

122

00:09:31.170  -->  00:09:35.600
40 to 50 you have 26 and so rich controls at that.

123

00:09:35.910  -->  00:09:38.760
And that's all we wanted to do here.

124

00:09:38.760  -->  00:09:43.680
The last thing you might want to do is change this access because it's not consistent with your percentage

125

00:09:43.680  -->  00:09:48.890
you might want to change a percentage but that's details we're just investigating so we won't be doing

126

00:09:48.890  -->  00:09:49.560
it right now.

127

00:09:49.770  -->  00:09:51.600
And that's all for today.

128

00:09:51.600  -->  00:09:53.160
I look forward to seeing you next time.

129

00:09:53.160  -->  00:09:54.780
And until then happy analyzing
