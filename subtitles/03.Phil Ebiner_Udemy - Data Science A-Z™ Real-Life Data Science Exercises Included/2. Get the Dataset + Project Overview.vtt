00:00:00.840  -->  00:00:09.120
All right so you get the data set you need to go to super dot assigns dot com slash training and then

2

00:00:09.120  -->  00:00:15.690
if you scroll down in part one realisation we need this section to how to use Tablo for data mining

3

00:00:16.320  -->  00:00:17.160
this dataset.

4

00:00:17.160  -->  00:00:22.180
So once you've downloaded it it's a couple megabytes I think.

5

00:00:22.260  -->  00:00:29.280
Then if you go to resolutions section or this is a folder that I created my desktop has got three sections

6

00:00:29.280  -->  00:00:33.940
for this part of a course and then churn investigation.

7

00:00:33.930  -->  00:00:36.460
There's churn modeling Oh it's just below megabyte.

8

00:00:36.480  -->  00:00:40.500
So we're going to open this up in Excel.

9

00:00:40.500  -->  00:00:43.380
Let me just you this here.

10

00:00:43.390  -->  00:00:49.380
And the interesting thing about this data set is it's actually the same one that we're going to be using

11

00:00:49.380  -->  00:00:54.450
for modeling down the track in the next part of the course.

12

00:00:54.600  -->  00:00:58.680
And therefore you get kind of a sneak peek of what to expect.

13

00:00:58.680  -->  00:01:03.950
It's always a good thing and that's how you would normally do it in a science project you would investigate

14

00:01:03.960  -->  00:01:10.380
your data set your mind at for data and then after you have some insights you would only then go ahead

15

00:01:10.380  -->  00:01:11.540
and create the model.

16

00:01:11.580  -->  00:01:15.680
So kind of we're doing it in the right chronology there anyway.

17

00:01:15.690  -->  00:01:17.010
So what does this data set.

18

00:01:17.010  -->  00:01:18.190
It's quite a large dose.

19

00:01:18.240  -->  00:01:20.980
It's got 10000 rows.

20

00:01:21.360  -->  00:01:22.770
It's got quite a few columns.

21

00:01:22.800  -->  00:01:27.740
This is a list of customers of a bank.

22

00:01:27.780  -->  00:01:29.230
Of course the sulf dictionary.

23

00:01:29.230  -->  00:01:34.990
So not a real list of customers of a bank and the customer I.D. here.

24

00:01:35.220  -->  00:01:40.500
They've got their surnames or the credit score of the person where the person's back.

25

00:01:40.510  -->  00:01:43.300
So let me explain the situation.

26

00:01:43.700  -->  00:01:49.890
There is this this is a bank in Europe that has operates in three countries France Spain and Germany

27

00:01:49.900  -->  00:01:50.110
.

28

00:01:50.490  -->  00:01:54.570
And it's got a lot of customers But recently they've seen they've been seeing a problem a lot of customers

29

00:01:54.570  -->  00:02:03.030
have been leaving their bank like on non normal churn rates so churn is when people leave a company

30

00:02:03.450  -->  00:02:09.630
and something they're not used to seeing and they're they decided to hire you as a ton of scientists

31

00:02:09.630  -->  00:02:16.200
to investigate this situation and tell them what exactly is going on and gives them some insights into

32

00:02:16.200  -->  00:02:19.370
the pros so they can come up with ways to fix it.

33

00:02:19.380  -->  00:02:24.960
So what this data set represents is it's not all of their customers is a massive bank.

34

00:02:24.960  -->  00:02:32.100
So this is just a small sample of their customers and what they did is they took this snapshot of their

35

00:02:32.100  -->  00:02:32.640
customers.

36

00:02:32.640  -->  00:02:38.940
They took 10000 customers randomly selected 10000 customers and then they said OK let's find out everything

37

00:02:38.940  -->  00:02:46.500
we can about them the customer the surname credit score geography where they bank gender age how long

38

00:02:46.500  -->  00:02:51.570
they've been with the bank that's Ten-Year balance number of products they have for banks that they

39

00:02:51.570  -->  00:02:58.290
have a credit card or a loan maybe a savings account have they do they have a credit card or not.

40

00:02:58.410  -->  00:03:04.620
Are they an active member so have they logs into the online banking in the past month or the definition

41

00:03:04.620  -->  00:03:05.610
of this can be different.

42

00:03:05.610  -->  00:03:06.330
Can be.

43

00:03:06.330  -->  00:03:09.310
Have they logged into their online banking past month or can it.

44

00:03:09.320  -->  00:03:10.190
It can be.

45

00:03:10.240  -->  00:03:15.480
Have they made a transaction in the past two months or something to that so it can be anything but they

46

00:03:15.480  -->  00:03:21.540
gave you this variable as a flag so you can go ahead and use it now and then like you would I either

47

00:03:21.540  -->  00:03:25.900
know the definition as they give you the variable or you can find out later if you find that this is

48

00:03:26.360  -->  00:03:33.150
an important verbal estimated salary so how much of that is is the banks think they're earning because

49

00:03:33.150  -->  00:03:37.950
they can't tell they can't they don't know that information they estimated the salary and then they

50

00:03:37.950  -->  00:03:39.330
didn't have this column originally.

51

00:03:39.330  -->  00:03:44.290
So what they did is they found out all this information and this is how these things are normally done

52

00:03:44.290  -->  00:03:44.310
.

53

00:03:44.310  -->  00:03:44.620
Right.

54

00:03:44.640  -->  00:03:47.100
So when you have a problem you want to run a test.

55

00:03:47.100  -->  00:03:53.190
So they found these 10000 customers randomly selected them funnel the information about them and then

56

00:03:53.190  -->  00:03:58.440
said OK so we got to watch these customers for six months and within six months we want to find out

57

00:03:58.440  -->  00:04:03.570
who these customers will leave and who these customers will stay and that's how this Colma here.

58

00:04:03.570  -->  00:04:08.090
So six months later they went back to this list and they checked.

59

00:04:08.110  -->  00:04:09.550
OK who left the bank.

60

00:04:09.660  -->  00:04:14.840
And if the person left the bank to put a one person stay still if the bank put a zero.

61

00:04:15.120  -->  00:04:19.890
So basically what this means is that you have some information customers which was measured before six

62

00:04:19.890  -->  00:04:24.870
months before the event or the second measurement took place.

63

00:04:25.110  -->  00:04:27.290
And then when the second measurement took place you kind of.

64

00:04:27.290  -->  00:04:28.010
No no.

65

00:04:28.030  -->  00:04:29.330
Six months on the track.

66

00:04:29.520  -->  00:04:33.410
Which customers are more likely to leave or which customers actually left.

67

00:04:33.680  -->  00:04:39.000
And from this information all of this information together in here you need to derive some insights

68

00:04:39.000  -->  00:04:48.030
for the bank and tell them OK maybe you know like things that you can observe some trends or some behavioral

69

00:04:48.030  -->  00:04:53.760
tendencies so this is all going to be analyzing a behavioral segmentation is going to be fun.

70

00:04:53.880  -->  00:04:58.810
We're going to look at for instance are females more likely to leave the bank and males and this can

71

00:04:58.820  -->  00:04:59.450
make sense right.

72

00:04:59.460  -->  00:05:01.820
It's a it's a basic Abts you want to see.

73

00:05:01.980  -->  00:05:02.550
All right.

74

00:05:02.550  -->  00:05:06.810
How many female customers left how many male customers left of all of these totals.

75

00:05:07.050  -->  00:05:14.670
And then obviously you have to normalize it by by the number of total female and male customers because

76

00:05:14.670  -->  00:05:17.110
this is probably going to be disproportionate anyway.

77

00:05:17.460  -->  00:05:18.840
And then you want to find out.

78

00:05:18.840  -->  00:05:24.630
So based on this column who is more likely fellow females or males or is it equal.

79

00:05:24.630  -->  00:05:27.160
And then you report that to the bank in Utah.

80

00:05:27.160  -->  00:05:27.680
OK.

81

00:05:27.720  -->  00:05:31.260
Actually imagine if you see that only female customers are leaving.

82

00:05:31.260  -->  00:05:33.310
How valuable is that to a bank.

83

00:05:33.480  -->  00:05:39.790
They'll be like Oh we're definitely doing something wrong and we need to cater for this segment overall

84

00:05:39.840  -->  00:05:46.290
market and make sure our offering is you know the right thing exactly what they're looking for maybe

85

00:05:46.290  -->  00:05:51.900
there's a competitor a bank you know some in some in one of the regions there's another bank that is

86

00:05:52.220  -->  00:05:56.250
take us taking away all of the customers for from from this bank.

87

00:05:56.250  -->  00:06:01.620
So there's lots of things that you might be able find out you will find in the upcoming stories is going

88

00:06:01.620  -->  00:06:02.160
to be fun.

89

00:06:02.160  -->  00:06:09.160
And this is how you investigate you learn how to investigate datasets like this so look for dependencies

90

00:06:09.180  -->  00:06:12.990
when you have like a binary outcome and you don't.

91

00:06:12.990  -->  00:06:14.490
It doesn't have to be customer data.

92

00:06:14.490  -->  00:06:18.600
So for a lot of customer centric organization this is going to be valuable.

93

00:06:18.600  -->  00:06:26.040
So I've done this personally I've done this so many times it is such a value add to any customer centric

94

00:06:26.040  -->  00:06:26.670
organization.

95

00:06:26.670  -->  00:06:31.390
So whenever whenever an organization deals with customers this is a lot of value.

96

00:06:31.400  -->  00:06:40.170
This is we're slowly venturing into the church of segmentation and then the other thing is even if your

97

00:06:40.290  -->  00:06:46.620
organization is not dealing directly with customers you don't have Darcis like like this or as a data

98

00:06:46.620  -->  00:06:51.090
scientist you're working on different projects you will still find a lot of valuable insights on how

99

00:06:51.090  -->  00:06:55.230
to run a B tests and Tablo how to work with chi square tests.

100

00:06:55.230  -->  00:07:02.670
What they mean basically and even just working with Tablo will be very valuable along learning how to

101

00:07:02.670  -->  00:07:05.270
work with Sabby Tablo will be valuable on the way.

102

00:07:05.490  -->  00:07:08.460
So without further ado let's get straight into it.

103

00:07:08.460  -->  00:07:12.160
We're going to get started in the next tutorial and I look forward to seeing you there.
