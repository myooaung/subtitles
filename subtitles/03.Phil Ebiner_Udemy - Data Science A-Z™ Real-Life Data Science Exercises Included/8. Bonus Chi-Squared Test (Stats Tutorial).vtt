00:00:00.990  -->  00:00:02.280
Welcome back to the course.

2

00:00:02.370  -->  00:00:04.880
And today we're talking about the chi square test.

3

00:00:04.890  -->  00:00:11.120
This is a statistical test that allows to back everything we've been doing so far in Tablo.

4

00:00:11.280  -->  00:00:17.820
So all those A B tests and classification or categorization tests that we've been doing they've been

5

00:00:17.910  -->  00:00:24.840
very intuitive and we've always said that sample size matters but we're not checking it per se and it's

6

00:00:24.840  -->  00:00:29.120
not a proper statistical test but it's very visual at the same time and fast.

7

00:00:29.160  -->  00:00:30.690
So it's kind of a tradeoff.

8

00:00:30.690  -->  00:00:36.510
It's been a trade off so far but today we will actually talk about the case squared test in detail and

9

00:00:36.510  -->  00:00:42.380
that will allow us to be more confident about the things we're doing and Tablo those intuitive things

10

00:00:42.390  -->  00:00:45.270
and especially when we're explaining them to somebody.

11

00:00:45.270  -->  00:00:51.540
We'll be confident that we are saying the right thing and that this is in fact the outcome and these

12

00:00:51.540  -->  00:00:52.600
are the insights.

13

00:00:52.740  -->  00:00:55.110
So let's get straight into it.

14

00:00:55.170  -->  00:00:56.820
This is the plan for today.

15

00:00:56.820  -->  00:01:04.350
First of all we're going to identify the problem we're going to look at an example from our previous

16

00:01:04.490  -->  00:01:10.680
Tablo manipulations then we will talk about what is a quite chi squared test and how it can help us

17

00:01:10.740  -->  00:01:11.930
solve that problem.

18

00:01:12.090  -->  00:01:17.640
Then we'll look at another example example to then we will actually run chi squared tests in Excel so

19

00:01:17.640  -->  00:01:24.440
I will show you how to build a chi square test in Excel and moreover you will get my template.

20

00:01:24.450  -->  00:01:28.800
You'll be able to download it so you can follow along and create the same thing or you can just download

21

00:01:28.800  -->  00:01:30.790
my template and for along that way.

22

00:01:31.020  -->  00:01:37.650
And also we will verify the chi squared results using an online tool so I'll show you a couple of online

23

00:01:37.650  -->  00:01:44.850
tools we can verify the results which are very it's a quick way to get the outcome of your case squared

24

00:01:44.850  -->  00:01:45.540
test.

25

00:01:45.540  -->  00:01:51.480
And finally we will talk about the chi squared rules and also haven't put in here but I will give you

26

00:01:51.630  -->  00:01:55.630
a challenge to take away a home for you to practice a cascade test.

27

00:01:55.830  -->  00:01:56.170
OK.

28

00:01:56.220  -->  00:01:57.200
Let's get straight into it.

29

00:01:57.200  -->  00:02:03.300
This might be quite a long tutorial so although it is quite an important one if you want to be 100 percent

30

00:02:03.300  -->  00:02:06.510
certain that you're talking about the right thing.

31

00:02:06.540  -->  00:02:13.980
All right so we had a look at agender in our course so far and there was a split between female and

32

00:02:13.980  -->  00:02:21.360
male and we saw that 25 percent of females were exited the bank in the period of observation from that

33

00:02:21.360  -->  00:02:26.110
sample of 10000 people and only 16 percent of males left the bank right.

34

00:02:26.130  -->  00:02:31.250
So the question here is and this is where we identify the challenge of the problem.

35

00:02:31.260  -->  00:02:35.600
The question is is that a statistically significant result.

36

00:02:35.610  -->  00:02:42.630
Can we say for certain that females are more likely or female customers are more likely to leave the

37

00:02:42.630  -->  00:02:47.280
bank than male customers or has or did this happen just by accident.

38

00:02:47.290  -->  00:02:49.760
Does this observation randomly happen.

39

00:02:49.770  -->  00:02:55.770
And that difference between 25 and 16 even though we can see it in our sample size in reality in the

40

00:02:55.770  -->  00:02:58.910
population is not going to be as visible.

41

00:02:58.920  -->  00:03:05.530
And in in the whole population of the bank there is no difference whether it's a female customer or

42

00:03:05.530  -->  00:03:07.900
a male customer they have the same likelihood of living.

43

00:03:08.100  -->  00:03:15.060
So that's when we need to run a chi squared test the because curve test will tell us if this is a random

44

00:03:15.060  -->  00:03:22.050
coincidence or this is in fact a statistically significant result that can be applied or extrapolated

45

00:03:22.050  -->  00:03:25.220
onto the whole population of the bank.

46

00:03:25.770  -->  00:03:32.400
So in order to run us chi squared test this is an important part that you have to remember that you

47

00:03:32.400  -->  00:03:38.130
cannot use percentages you have to change percentages to the absolute figures so we're going to go back

48

00:03:38.130  -->  00:03:43.290
to our absolutes and this is what it looked like in absolutes as you can see there's less female customers

49

00:03:43.290  -->  00:03:44.980
than male customers.

50

00:03:45.420  -->  00:03:48.370
And the exited valid numbers are presented there.

51

00:03:48.480  -->  00:03:51.330
So now let's put this information into a table.

52

00:03:51.330  -->  00:03:52.770
This is what will look like.

53

00:03:52.770  -->  00:03:55.100
This is the observed table this is what we saw.

54

00:03:55.320  -->  00:04:00.750
The number of male and female customers that stay the next it's so you've got the categories as Rose

55

00:04:00.810  -->  00:04:03.630
and you've got the outcomes as columns.

56

00:04:03.740  -->  00:04:10.500
That is the conventional way of presenting a chi squared test a table for a chi squared test.

57

00:04:10.500  -->  00:04:14.670
Now there is in this case squared test there's a second table that you need to create and that table

58

00:04:14.670  -->  00:04:16.640
is called the expected table.

59

00:04:16.680  -->  00:04:20.460
I'm going to use my mouse here because it's pretty important.

60

00:04:20.490  -->  00:04:25.350
So you've got a total of Melkus which you take these two you add them up and gives you a total number

61

00:04:25.350  -->  00:04:26.550
of male customers.

62

00:04:26.550  -->  00:04:27.160
Right.

63

00:04:27.240  -->  00:04:31.430
And that will be about just over 5000 customers.

64

00:04:31.440  -->  00:04:36.620
Now if you take these two the total number of exited and you add them up.

65

00:04:36.630  -->  00:04:41.910
Ill give you about 2000 and we know that there's a total in this whole table the total is 10000.

66

00:04:41.910  -->  00:04:47.470
So 2000 divided by 10000 gives you 20 percent 20 percent of people exit.

67

00:04:47.580  -->  00:04:47.840
Right.

68

00:04:47.850  -->  00:04:57.120
So now this expected table what it represents is if there is no dependency so if leaving the company

69

00:04:57.450  -->  00:05:02.850
the decision to leave the company is independent of gender then what we would expect is that 20 percent

70

00:05:02.850  -->  00:05:06.440
of males leave and 20 percent of females do make sense right.

71

00:05:06.440  -->  00:05:14.430
So if you know that 20 percent of people overall leave the company from from the sample size then it

72

00:05:14.430  -->  00:05:18.350
should be the same for males and females should be 20 percent here and should be 20 percent here.

73

00:05:18.480  -->  00:05:23.400
And that's exactly how you create this table so you calculate 20 percent of the total males you add

74

00:05:23.400  -->  00:05:26.790
up the males you get the 20 percent and then whatever's left.

75

00:05:26.800  -->  00:05:32.550
And those are the ones that stayed and whatever went to females same thing you add up then you get 20

76

00:05:32.560  -->  00:05:38.530
percent of that and whatever's left those customers decided to stay and that's what we expect to see

77

00:05:38.520  -->  00:05:38.550
.

78

00:05:38.560  -->  00:05:40.220
This is what we saw in reality.

79

00:05:40.340  -->  00:05:45.150
And if you look at these two tables they are quite different so the expected value here is over a thousand

80

00:05:45.150  -->  00:05:46.690
here is below 900.

81

00:05:46.710  -->  00:05:48.150
Here is the opposite is below.

82

00:05:48.150  -->  00:05:51.490
It's just just above 900 here over 1100.

83

00:05:51.780  -->  00:05:56.850
And so what the chi squared test will do for you it will tell you is the difference between this table

84

00:05:56.940  -->  00:06:03.330
and this table a random difference or is it a statistically significant difference.

85

00:06:03.330  -->  00:06:07.610
So by default we say that the difference is not statistically significant.

86

00:06:07.620  -->  00:06:15.210
It's just a random coincidence so pretty much we're saying that this table is just like this table plus

87

00:06:15.210  -->  00:06:20.310
minus some little random error which we can discard what the chi square test allows you to do is it

88

00:06:20.310  -->  00:06:29.700
allows you to re reboot rebut or disqualify that hypothesis and say that actually this is a statistically

89

00:06:29.820  -->  00:06:31.620
significant result.

90

00:06:31.650  -->  00:06:39.920
So that means that chi squared is a test designed to test the probability of independence.

91

00:06:39.940  -->  00:06:48.090
So we're testing whether our variable that we're looking at so exited is yes or no is it independent

92

00:06:48.120  -->  00:06:48.980
of gender.

93

00:06:49.000  -->  00:06:53.850
That's what we're testing we're testing the probability of independence and that's important to remember

94

00:06:53.860  -->  00:06:54.520
.

95

00:06:54.510  -->  00:06:56.440
Now let's look at a second example.

96

00:06:56.450  -->  00:07:03.720
Before we continue on to excel here we've got has credit cards and other tests that we ran in Tablo

97

00:07:03.740  -->  00:07:03.790
.

98

00:07:03.780  -->  00:07:08.840
And here you can see that there does it doesn't look like there's any difference right.

99

00:07:08.860  -->  00:07:11.010
It doesn't look like it does.

100

00:07:11.130  -->  00:07:15.960
It makes a difference whether or not you have a credit card not you pretty much like 20 percent of those

101

00:07:15.960  -->  00:07:20.330
who had a credit card exited and 21 percent of those who didn't have a credit card exited.

102

00:07:20.520  -->  00:07:20.810
OK.

103

00:07:20.810  -->  00:07:24.180
So from Tablo we can kind of see that intuitively.

104

00:07:24.370  -->  00:07:28.900
Now if you move to the chi square test you've got we have to get rid of the percentages we have to go

105

00:07:28.890  -->  00:07:31.210
back to salute values which is important.

106

00:07:31.440  -->  00:07:34.590
We have to create the observed table which looks like that.

107

00:07:34.590  -->  00:07:36.540
So we just put in these numbers in there.

108

00:07:36.750  -->  00:07:41.010
We have to create the expected table which we know how to create now.

109

00:07:41.110  -->  00:07:46.800
So we take a total number of people who have credit cards and multiplied by 20 percent.

110

00:07:46.800  -->  00:07:52.900
That will give us this value and then we whatever's left is the people that stayed.

111

00:07:52.890  -->  00:07:58.080
So the people that we would expect to stay and the same thing for people who don't have credit cards

112

00:07:58.080  -->  00:07:58.100
.

113

00:07:58.120  -->  00:08:02.940
This is 20 percent of the total that we have here and that's everybody else.

114

00:08:02.940  -->  00:08:09.670
So what I wanted to highlight here before from now from here we're going to move to excel but before

115

00:08:09.660  -->  00:08:17.160
we do I wanted to highlight too that in Excel we're going to get some results and it's probably going

116

00:08:17.160  -->  00:08:20.150
to be not statistically significant.

117

00:08:20.160  -->  00:08:23.570
So meaning that there is no difference whether you have a credit card or not.

118

00:08:23.820  -->  00:08:28.290
But from here what you can see is that in this chart.

119

00:08:28.320  -->  00:08:28.970
Right.

120

00:08:29.160  -->  00:08:33.010
And in these tables overall if we're preparing for the squared test.

121

00:08:33.150  -->  00:08:36.500
It's all very complicated to see this.

122

00:08:36.590  -->  00:08:43.480
It doesn't doesn't scream at you doesn't tell you like hey this is not a statistically significant result

123

00:08:43.500  -->  00:08:43.720
.

124

00:08:44.080  -->  00:08:52.630
But when you look at the Tablo result here you can see that it is pretty obvious that there is no statistical

125

00:08:52.620  -->  00:08:59.490
significance like you without going into too much detail you can say that I'm quite like I'm not 100

126

00:08:59.500  -->  00:09:04.800
percent certain of the result but I can see that most likely there isn't any statistical significance

127

00:09:04.800  -->  00:09:08.960
here and it's just a random kind of coincidence that these are a bit higher than these.

128

00:09:09.210  -->  00:09:14.560
And that is the beauty of this approach this framework that I'm showing you on top of that you can do

129

00:09:14.550  -->  00:09:21.810
that so quickly you don't have to run the full test every single time just to visualize these things

130

00:09:22.290  -->  00:09:22.730
anyway.

131

00:09:22.750  -->  00:09:24.740
So let's move on to excel.

132

00:09:24.750  -->  00:09:31.510
I'm going to end this show this show and I'm going to bring up Excel and I'll show you how to create

133

00:09:31.680  -->  00:09:32.910
the test.

134

00:09:32.910  -->  00:09:43.680
So here I'm going to zoom in a little bit and then I'm going to say chi squared test and let's create

135

00:09:43.680  -->  00:09:47.640
our table so the first table is the observed table.

136

00:09:47.970  -->  00:09:49.440
Whoops.

137

00:09:51.070  -->  00:09:52.050
Observed table right.

138

00:09:52.060  -->  00:09:54.370
So I'm going to just copy the data.

139

00:09:54.370  -->  00:09:59.920
This is going to be for our one second.

140

00:09:59.940  -->  00:10:01.470
So this is going to be this.

141

00:10:01.510  -->  00:10:04.620
I'm going to copy for gender.

142

00:10:04.620  -->  00:10:05.300
There we go.

143

00:10:05.350  -->  00:10:08.760
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add up the records right.

144

00:10:08.790  -->  00:10:11.150
So maybe let's take observed and put it there.

145

00:10:11.190  -->  00:10:16.500
I'm going to add up the records I'm going to say alt's plus plus gives you the sum all plus plus all

146

00:10:16.500  -->  00:10:21.090
plus plus plus plus right and then just do not add plus plus.

147

00:10:21.100  -->  00:10:24.490
So now we know there's 10000 records in here in total.

148

00:10:24.490  -->  00:10:31.590
There's five thousand four hundred males females and that's the people who stayed the people who exited

149

00:10:31.630  -->  00:10:32.110
right.

150

00:10:32.110  -->  00:10:38.770
So we've created the observed table now let's create the expected expect the table right so it's going

151

00:10:38.770  -->  00:10:39.410
to be similar.

152

00:10:39.430  -->  00:10:42.500
We need male female state exited.

153

00:10:42.760  -->  00:10:45.040
But this is going to be a calculation.

154

00:10:45.040  -->  00:10:51.400
So it's very simple to create an excel go equals and you look at the people who stayed right and you

155

00:10:51.400  -->  00:10:53.650
devised by the people overall.

156

00:10:53.770  -->  00:10:59.140
And then you multiply so that's a percentage of people who stayed and you multiply that by the number

157

00:10:59.140  -->  00:11:03.180
of males that you have in total equals.

158

00:11:03.190  -->  00:11:05.260
So here what do we want to do.

159

00:11:05.260  -->  00:11:07.090
We want to do the same for the rest of them.

160

00:11:07.300  -->  00:11:11.410
But in order to speed things up we're just going to lock some of these cells by clicking a for we don't

161

00:11:11.410  -->  00:11:14.380
want this one to move ever then with this one.

162

00:11:14.410  -->  00:11:15.850
We don't want it to move.

163

00:11:15.880  -->  00:11:17.230
We don't want the number to change.

164

00:11:17.230  -->  00:11:18.420
We'll look at the number.

165

00:11:18.670  -->  00:11:22.050
And with this one we don't want the column to change.

166

00:11:22.040  -->  00:11:23.620
We always wanted to be in column D.

167

00:11:23.680  -->  00:11:26.200
So we look at the letter click OK.

168

00:11:26.740  -->  00:11:30.520
And now if I copy it here as you can see it's already done everything for me.

169

00:11:30.550  -->  00:11:33.400
It's looking at the percentage of people who it.

170

00:11:33.400  -->  00:11:38.560
So this column divided by this column or the cell divide by this cell multiplied by a total number of

171

00:11:38.560  -->  00:11:39.340
males.

172

00:11:39.370  -->  00:11:40.160
So there you go.

173

00:11:40.180  -->  00:11:44.740
Eleven one hundred eleven thousand in out in our expected table we had a bit of a different value but

174

00:11:44.740  -->  00:11:49.100
that's because of rounding errors because we took a 20 percent by default.

175

00:11:49.120  -->  00:11:51.890
Here it's a bit different to 20 percent inreality.

176

00:11:52.000  -->  00:11:53.600
So let's copy this one here.

177

00:11:53.740  -->  00:11:54.330
Just check.

178

00:11:54.340  -->  00:11:56.650
You see that same doing the same thing.

179

00:11:56.860  -->  00:12:00.150
Percentage of State times total females.

180

00:12:00.520  -->  00:12:02.370
And here same thing.

181

00:12:02.650  -->  00:12:07.220
So we taking exited divide by 10000 and multiply by total females.

182

00:12:07.420  -->  00:12:08.190
There we go.

183

00:12:08.350  -->  00:12:09.540
So one more time.

184

00:12:09.550  -->  00:12:16.280
All plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus.

185

00:12:16.510  -->  00:12:20.310
So here you can notice that this value is the same as this value doesn't change because the whole number

186

00:12:20.310  -->  00:12:22.010
of mails doesn't change.

187

00:12:22.050  -->  00:12:23.820
It doesn't matter how you count.

188

00:12:23.860  -->  00:12:24.490
Right.

189

00:12:24.530  -->  00:12:26.580
And number of females doesn't change.

190

00:12:26.590  -->  00:12:32.070
But what does change is the proportion of state takes it and in each one of them.

191

00:12:32.080  -->  00:12:35.900
So here you can see that it's different to that you can say is different to that.

192

00:12:36.100  -->  00:12:41.790
But once again these don't change so the total number of exited didn't change the total number of stay

193

00:12:41.790  -->  00:12:42.460
didn't change.

194

00:12:42.460  -->  00:12:44.520
That's a good quality check for you.

195

00:12:44.590  -->  00:12:48.860
And here you have 10000 people here you have ten thousand people too.

196

00:12:48.880  -->  00:12:52.380
So last thing we need to do is check the P-value.

197

00:12:52.420  -->  00:12:58.690
So P-value will basically tell you if what the chi squared test would result it's giving back to you

198

00:12:58.690  -->  00:12:58.970
.

199

00:12:59.020  -->  00:13:03.550
So we're going to say equals chi test.

200

00:13:04.030  -->  00:13:11.830
And here we want the actual range as you can see actual ranges that Colma expected range which is that

201

00:13:13.300  -->  00:13:14.280
click enter.

202

00:13:14.380  -->  00:13:17.000
And as you can see P-value is very small.

203

00:13:17.040  -->  00:13:20.800
It even had to use a mathematical or scientific term.

204

00:13:20.830  -->  00:13:28.180
So that is a 10 to the power of minus 26 very small P-value what you need to check is significance level

205

00:13:28.180  -->  00:13:29.860
.

206

00:13:29.860  -->  00:13:30.150
Right.

207

00:13:30.150  -->  00:13:33.700
So we're going to say our significance level is 0.05.

208

00:13:33.850  -->  00:13:40.840
What that means without going into too much detail what that means is that this is basically 5 percent

209

00:13:40.870  -->  00:13:50.380
which is saying that what is the probability that the what is a cut off probability that we want to

210

00:13:50.380  -->  00:13:55.240
check that this is a that this is a random result.

211

00:13:55.240  -->  00:14:04.090
So basically we want to say that Micheaux on an example so if P-value is less than zero point zero or

212

00:14:04.090  -->  00:14:13.880
five then we will say not random Otherwise we will say independent.

213

00:14:13.880  -->  00:14:14.680
Right.

214

00:14:14.800  -->  00:14:16.440
In a dependent.

215

00:14:16.680  -->  00:14:19.730
OK so what this is telling us is that I'm sorry.

216

00:14:19.900  -->  00:14:27.070
So what this is telling us is that because the p value is less than your significance level that this

217

00:14:27.070  -->  00:14:36.040
is not a random result that what you're seeing is some sort of correlation that the results state are

218

00:14:36.040  -->  00:14:41.230
exited is actually dependent on your variable which is gender in this case.

219

00:14:41.230  -->  00:14:48.760
If on the other hand the p value was greater than 0.05 then you would be able to say that the result

220

00:14:48.850  -->  00:14:55.240
is random meaning that your variable here is not dependant on age.

221

00:14:55.390  -->  00:15:06.280
So I'm going to save this I'm going to wait one second I'm going to just bring up my Zeshan section

222

00:15:06.290  -->  00:15:06.320
.

223

00:15:06.340  -->  00:15:08.080
I'll just save it here in advance.

224

00:15:08.080  -->  00:15:14.510
Data mining and this will be chi squared.

225

00:15:14.530  -->  00:15:14.930
All right.

226

00:15:14.980  -->  00:15:25.290
So now what I would like to do is take the values for the state and exited in terms of the has credit

227

00:15:25.290  -->  00:15:29.520
cards so will copy these values into our test and see how that goes.

228

00:15:29.770  -->  00:15:35.420
So I'll just copy them here and then I'll just copy.

229

00:15:35.620  -->  00:15:42.680
I'm just going to copy the values before the formats and then I'll get rid of these two.

230

00:15:43.180  -->  00:15:43.890
All right.

231

00:15:44.350  -->  00:15:50.650
So here what you can see is a different result right here you can see what we have to change this.

232

00:15:50.660  -->  00:15:53.630
This is going to be yes no.

233

00:15:53.650  -->  00:15:56.240
Don't forget to change that.

234

00:15:56.530  -->  00:16:01.240
So here we can see that this is our observed and this is what we're expecting.

235

00:16:01.540  -->  00:16:08.260
And the P-value here is 0.4 7 so it's huge it's a it's a massive P-value 47 percent 47 percent.

236

00:16:08.260  -->  00:16:14.650
Once again we're not going to details of P-value we're just using it as as a flag or a trigger for us

237

00:16:14.650  -->  00:16:15.360
I guess.

238

00:16:15.370  -->  00:16:19.070
So then this is what the chi square test spits out.

239

00:16:19.300  -->  00:16:25.000
And since it's greater than the significance level which is Serpens or 5 here you can see that the result

240

00:16:25.000  -->  00:16:32.800
is independent meaning that our variable stayed exited has nothing to do with whether or not they have

241

00:16:32.800  -->  00:16:34.020
a credit card or not.

242

00:16:34.300  -->  00:16:40.390
And once again so we bring up the presentation now once again here from Tablo we could see this right

243

00:16:40.390  -->  00:16:43.120
away we could tell 21 percent 20 percent.

244

00:16:43.270  -->  00:16:46.870
Not a big difference like you can really tell from here or from any of this.

245

00:16:47.050  -->  00:16:49.530
But from here you can totally tell.

246

00:16:49.570  -->  00:16:55.690
And once again you can run the square test just to make sure that you're on the right track.

247

00:16:55.690  -->  00:16:56.810
All right.

248

00:16:56.890  -->  00:17:02.470
So now what I wanted to show you is an online tool how to run the squared test.

249

00:17:02.470  -->  00:17:03.760
There's our online tool.

250

00:17:03.760  -->  00:17:08.610
So let me just move this to credit card and you just this is the Web site.

251

00:17:08.610  -->  00:17:09.550
I like this tool.

252

00:17:09.580  -->  00:17:17.440
Evan Miller dot org slash Abey hyphen testing's slash chi hyphen square dot HD mal.

253

00:17:17.560  -->  00:17:24.700
So you're putting your successes here and say in this case six hundred thirteen of our total trials

254

00:17:24.720  -->  00:17:24.760
.

255

00:17:24.770  -->  00:17:25.810
OK that's a good question.

256

00:17:25.810  -->  00:17:28.030
What are our total trials.

257

00:17:28.600  -->  00:17:33.820
So our total trials here is so 613.

258

00:17:33.820  -->  00:17:39.740
There we go and total trials is 2 9 4 5.

259

00:17:39.970  -->  00:17:48.730
And here you've got sample 2 you've got 1424 and you told trials is five thousand six hundred thirty

260

00:17:48.730  -->  00:17:49.880
one.

261

00:17:49.900  -->  00:17:50.650
No I'm sorry.

262

00:17:50.650  -->  00:17:54.010
This is actually seven or five five.

263

00:17:54.010  -->  00:17:54.610
There you go.

264

00:17:54.790  -->  00:17:56.050
So what does the test tell us.

265

00:17:56.050  -->  00:17:57.600
No significant difference right.

266

00:17:57.610  -->  00:18:00.590
So we put it in our valleys just like here.

267

00:18:00.610  -->  00:18:03.760
Basically what it did it just ran a quick test for us.

268

00:18:03.760  -->  00:18:05.030
No significant difference.

269

00:18:05.110  -->  00:18:07.470
P-value What is the p values point 48.

270

00:18:07.480  -->  00:18:08.230
What did we get.

271

00:18:08.230  -->  00:18:16.470
Zero point forty eight exactly the same P-value and we can do the same for gender Now if we like.

272

00:18:16.660  -->  00:18:17.980
So if we just go back

273

00:18:20.860  -->  00:18:28.530
there we go so male female will do the same thing eight nine eight 0 is going to be five four five seven

274

00:18:28.530  -->  00:18:28.980
.

275

00:18:29.020  -->  00:18:33.000
Here it's 1 1 3 9 4 5 4 3.

276

00:18:33.280  -->  00:18:36.960
So simple 2 is more successful Don't don't look at that.

277

00:18:36.970  -->  00:18:42.100
Which one is more successful in our case it's the opposite because we're looking at exited as a success

278

00:18:42.100  -->  00:18:42.340
.

279

00:18:42.400  -->  00:18:45.620
But what you can see here is that P-value is tiny.

280

00:18:45.670  -->  00:18:49.180
We get a tiny P-value and the result is the same.

281

00:18:49.180  -->  00:18:50.410
It's not random.

282

00:18:50.410  -->  00:18:53.440
So here you can see that it's not random as well.

283

00:18:53.440  -->  00:18:56.280
So that's how you run the case test.

284

00:18:56.320  -->  00:18:57.240
We're running out of time.

285

00:18:57.250  -->  00:19:04.150
I'm going to end this tutorial now and in the next tutorial I will show you some up on the chi squared

286

00:19:04.240  -->  00:19:08.110
and I'll give you an exercise to take home and look for it.

287

00:19:08.110  -->  00:19:08.860
See you next time.

288

00:19:08.860  -->  00:19:10.420
Until then happy analyzing
