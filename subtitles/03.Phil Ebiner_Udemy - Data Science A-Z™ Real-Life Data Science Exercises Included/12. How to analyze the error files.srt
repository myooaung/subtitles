1

00:00:00,390  -->  00:00:05,610
All right so now you've performed this complex upload process and in your database you have some data

2

00:00:05,610  -->  00:00:10,560
that you can analyze most of the data actually forty nine thousand eight hundred sixty eight rows out

3

00:00:10,560  -->  00:00:11,540
of the 50000.

4

00:00:11,580  -->  00:00:14,390
And for that you were supplied with.

5

00:00:14,550  -->  00:00:23,070
However the question is What do you do with these anomalies or these files of rows that you're not including

6

00:00:23,070  -->  00:00:32,220
in your database at the moment so the 132 rows in this flood file this so those that didn't have sufficient

7

00:00:32,220  -->  00:00:38,840
data and those with bad records those four rows of bad records what do you do with them.

8

00:00:39,000  -->  00:00:40,880
And do you need to include them in your analysis.

9

00:00:40,890  -->  00:00:43,490
And that's what we'll be talking about today.

10

00:00:43,740  -->  00:00:50,020
So there are two options here option number one which is my favorite is when it's not important.

11

00:00:50,280  -->  00:00:58,290
And this is when your analysis that you're doing is of a certain nature where you're looking for averages

12

00:00:58,290  -->  00:01:05,400
or you're looking for kind of trends and you're generally aggregating the data and you don't really

13

00:01:05,610  -->  00:01:14,850
mind if there is a 5 percent error in your results and it's acceptable because you're looking for you'll

14

00:01:14,870  -->  00:01:18,510
get a big big sample is 50 50 thousand rows.

15

00:01:18,660  -->  00:01:25,620
And if you're taking the average of the sample then not having 132 hundred thirty six records that are

16

00:01:25,620  -->  00:01:33,500
not substantial outliers you can assume that that doesn't really affect the average overall So if you're

17

00:01:33,510  -->  00:01:38,850
looking at things like that or or different types of distributions core tiles deciles things like that

18

00:01:38,850  -->  00:01:39,100
.

19

00:01:39,210  -->  00:01:44,640
Then in your final report you can just state that some of the daughter has been excluded due to irregularities

20

00:01:44,640  -->  00:01:51,090
and anomalies and this is the number of records that has been used in this analysis.

21

00:01:51,090  -->  00:01:56,490
On the other hand there is Scenario 2 and that is the scenario when these records are important for

22

00:01:56,500  -->  00:02:04,830
instance you're doing a fraud investigation or you reporting to the executives on how certain departments

23

00:02:04,830  -->  00:02:10,530
are performing or how your customers are spending and you have to make sure that the data or the final

24

00:02:10,530  -->  00:02:17,850
result that you have it actually matches to the result that they see on a daily basis coming from reporting

25

00:02:17,850  -->  00:02:24,510
services or something like that so you can't it can't even be out by one dollar it has to be exact on

26

00:02:24,510  -->  00:02:30,870
the spot because what they see from other reports and what you're reporting on is coming from the same

27

00:02:30,870  -->  00:02:31,920
data source.

28

00:02:32,010  -->  00:02:37,920
So therefore it has to match and if it doesn't match then that they're going to have a lot of questions

29

00:02:37,920  -->  00:02:38,710
.

30

00:02:38,730  -->  00:02:46,140
So if you're in the second scenario where it's important to make sure that you eventually include these

31

00:02:46,140  -->  00:02:54,510
rows or at least find out what's going on there then the ideal solution to that scenario is if you go

32

00:02:54,510  -->  00:03:00,150
back to the person who gave you this doctor who gave you these files or if you took them yourself if

33

00:03:00,150  -->  00:03:05,940
you access the data yourself by yourself like through a database or something then you go to the person

34

00:03:05,940  -->  00:03:12,630
who who is the custodian of his daughter who's governing all the processes around this data who's looking

35

00:03:12,630  -->  00:03:13,010
after it.

36

00:03:13,020  -->  00:03:18,780
And you talk to that person you e-mail them you call them you run to them I don't know like you have

37

00:03:18,780  -->  00:03:26,580
to get in touch with the person who's in charge and question them on the specific rows because it is

38

00:03:26,580  -->  00:03:30,270
their job to make sure that there are no anomalies in the data.

39

00:03:30,270  -->  00:03:37,680
And big organizations usually have departments that look after the data they have data custodians who

40

00:03:38,250  -->  00:03:43,990
make sure that there are no irregularities that Eudora's clean and well-presented and so on.

41

00:03:44,190  -->  00:03:48,750
And you talk to them and they should be able to help you out and say oh no those are old records that

42

00:03:48,750  -->  00:03:54,720
shouldn't be there or you might even alarm them and alert them to something that they haven't they're

43

00:03:54,720  -->  00:04:00,100
not aware of and you might actually help them resolve an issue in the back end of the database or of

44

00:04:00,350  -->  00:04:01,470
one of the systems.

45

00:04:01,710  -->  00:04:03,960
And you know do them a favor that way.

46

00:04:03,990  -->  00:04:09,880
But at the end of the day you need them to help you resolve these issues.

47

00:04:09,930  -->  00:04:17,850
And finally if you don't have the time if you can't wait for their response because those people are

48

00:04:17,850  -->  00:04:24,480
usually busy and takes time for them to respond then you can try the risky option and attempt to fix

49

00:04:24,480  -->  00:04:29,400
the data itself like this data that where there is insufficient data Well there's nothing you can do

50

00:04:29,400  -->  00:04:38,190
about it you just just can't fix it you can have a look at the file and just make sure that it is actually

51

00:04:38,190  -->  00:04:43,890
insufficient data that the rows haven't been skewed so maybe the columns that you're interested in maybe

52

00:04:43,890  -->  00:04:50,580
that zip code column has been skewed because of an anomaly or corruption in the data set and you actually

53

00:04:50,580  -->  00:04:56,190
can fix that and return the zip code to its normal place and that way you will be able to access the

54

00:04:56,190  -->  00:04:57,320
data that you need.

55

00:04:57,630  -->  00:05:01,010
But if the data is just not there then there's nothing you can do about it.

56

00:05:01,020  -->  00:05:06,900
And you have to go back to the previous solution where you find the person who's in charge of this data

57

00:05:07,680  -->  00:05:13,380
and you find other means of investigation and you actually get your hands on the original proper original

58

00:05:13,380  -->  00:05:16,620
data with the bad records.

59

00:05:16,620  -->  00:05:22,190
In most cases I hate to like give you the Bladen truth.

60

00:05:22,190  -->  00:05:30,830
But in most cases you won't be able to fix up data issues data corruption and irregularities because

61

00:05:31,160  -->  00:05:32,000
they can.

62

00:05:32,090  -->  00:05:38,750
There's a huge range of things that can happen of data and like you saw in Roe 81 just some columns

63

00:05:38,930  -->  00:05:43,850
are complete completely got mangled up and they weren't there and some calls were in a wrong place and

64

00:05:44,930  -->  00:05:46,020
some of those issues.

65

00:05:46,040  -->  00:05:47,910
There's nothing you can do about them.

66

00:05:48,170  -->  00:05:55,070
But at the same time if it is a simple issue with text qualifiers like we've been investigating so far

67

00:05:55,340  -->  00:06:01,130
then maybe there's a chance that you can fix it up by through what you know already from the scores

68

00:06:01,190  -->  00:06:07,370
how the text qualifiers are meant to be placed and what programs like Excel could have done with your

69

00:06:07,370  -->  00:06:08,480
data set.

70

00:06:08,480  -->  00:06:15,260
So there is a chance that you can fix them but if you do approach it from that perspective then make

71

00:06:15,250  -->  00:06:21,200
sure that somebody checks your work because the last thing you want is check for records out of over

72

00:06:21,200  -->  00:06:28,100
50000 that you fixed up manually and you did something wrong and they completely messed up your analysis

73

00:06:28,110  -->  00:06:28,710
.

74

00:06:29,330  -->  00:06:34,670
So make sure somebody checks your work and explain to them what you did and hopefully somebody more

75

00:06:34,670  -->  00:06:35,880
senior can say that.

76

00:06:35,890  -->  00:06:36,470
OK.

77

00:06:36,560  -->  00:06:37,640
You did the right thing.

78

00:06:37,710  -->  00:06:41,200
And this looks like it's fixed up and it's good.

79

00:06:41,810  -->  00:06:43,010
Whatever you do.

80

00:06:43,100  -->  00:06:50,000
If however you get this daughter what you need to do afterwards is re uploaded but separately so this

81

00:06:50,000  -->  00:06:55,580
is this is done we have uploaded all 49000 868 records and we're happy with them.

82

00:06:55,580  -->  00:07:01,270
We're not going to get this data and then put in the flat file source and do that all that again no

83

00:07:01,290  -->  00:07:01,640
.

84

00:07:01,670  -->  00:07:08,670
So once you have the correct data which is missing right now then you create a new upload so you create

85

00:07:08,670  -->  00:07:13,400
in your original file you put them in there you upload them separately you create a new profile in a

86

00:07:13,460  -->  00:07:19,790
school and then later on when you're working in sequel you will be able to combine the two raw files

87

00:07:19,820  -->  00:07:22,060
this raw file and the other file.

88

00:07:22,190  -->  00:07:28,760
It's much better to do it that way because you once again have traceability of what was done and you

89

00:07:28,750  -->  00:07:35,930
always have the wrong data sets are all tables separately and SDL and you can always reverse if there

90

00:07:35,990  -->  00:07:42,950
is some issues or some issues and to finish off what we're going to do today is we're going to look

91

00:07:43,070  -->  00:07:46,230
at this specific file so just the bad records.

92

00:07:46,460  -->  00:07:50,170
And just for practice sake because you'll have this in your homework.

93

00:07:50,180  -->  00:07:56,720
We will see if we can understand exactly what happened in which one of those rows and identify where

94

00:07:56,970  -->  00:07:59,880
you know the text qualifier was missing or what was wrong.

95

00:08:00,050  -->  00:08:02,850
So let's go ahead and get started with that.

96

00:08:02,880  -->  00:08:08,830
There is a folder of the automatically exclude results and we're going to be looking at the fake names

97

00:08:08,840  -->  00:08:10,000
bad records.

98

00:08:10,310  -->  00:08:14,150
So I'm going to open it up with notepad plus plus.

99

00:08:14,810  -->  00:08:22,460
And here you've got all these qualifiers because that's how we create the file we asked for access qualifiers

100

00:08:22,550  -->  00:08:23,830
just in case.

101

00:08:24,320  -->  00:08:30,970
And now I'm going to open up the original file so in fact we're going to do is what I like to do in

102

00:08:30,980  -->  00:08:33,850
these cases is just make a copy just in case.

103

00:08:33,980  -->  00:08:42,020
So in case we messed something up here so we don't have to rerun the upload and then we'll go to the

104

00:08:42,010  -->  00:08:51,990
fake names original daughter take a copy so we copied that file go to analysis go to data errors and

105

00:08:52,050  -->  00:08:54,680
in automatically so we'll just put it in here.

106

00:08:54,830  -->  00:09:05,090
And so we'll just say at the bottom copy and just so they're close together we'll say copy here as well

107

00:09:05,090  -->  00:09:06,330
.

108

00:09:06,560  -->  00:09:13,280
And now we can look at them both in Notepad plus plus so added with notepad plus plus.

109

00:09:14,090  -->  00:09:22,070
And this one as well as you remember right click move to other view.

110

00:09:22,230  -->  00:09:26,570
There's a we can synchronize them if we want to maybe vertically.

111

00:09:26,570  -->  00:09:31,060
Let's try that.

112

00:09:31,340  -->  00:09:35,050
You synchronize vertical and horizontal scrolling so.

113

00:09:35,300  -->  00:09:39,820
So this way they're synchronized but they might not might not really work because there's a lot of text

114

00:09:40,010  -->  00:09:46,300
wildfire's vertical there's no point so luckily for these records we have their own numbers sometimes

115

00:09:46,900  -->  00:09:49,720
these row numbers because they're actually built into the data.

116

00:09:49,730  -->  00:09:55,520
They could also get corrupted and that way you'll have to search through other means like the name surname

117

00:09:55,520  -->  00:10:00,230
so find that way find it that way but now we have their own numbers so let's go ahead and look at them

118

00:10:00,230  -->  00:10:00,740
.

119

00:10:00,740  -->  00:10:09,160
So two to one 7:6 I'm just going to look here two to 176 not one not one.

120

00:10:09,160  -->  00:10:09,800
There we go.

121

00:10:09,800  -->  00:10:11,670
So there's 2 2 1 7 6.

122

00:10:11,990  -->  00:10:18,380
And so let's slowly scroll through and understand what could have happened and we really know it's probably

123

00:10:18,380  -->  00:10:24,820
a text qualifier somewhere around the feedback section and that's where we'll look right away.

124

00:10:25,390  -->  00:10:25,890
There we go.

125

00:10:25,900  -->  00:10:28,940
I'm so happy I found this company right.

126

00:10:30,250  -->  00:10:31,690
Coma they save me a lot of time.

127

00:10:31,690  -->  00:10:32,590
What did that turn.

128

00:10:32,590  -->  00:10:36,430
What does it look like here here.

129

00:10:36,990  -->  00:10:42,600
So I'm going to switch off this scrolling synchronization.

130

00:10:43,090  -->  00:10:44,340
So what does it look like here.

131

00:10:44,350  -->  00:10:55,000
I am so happy here is being separated as different columns and obviously because there was no text qualifiers

132

00:10:55,000  -->  00:10:55,440
at all.

133

00:10:55,480  -->  00:11:01,090
That's exactly normal that's what should have happened because here I am so happy I found this company

134

00:11:01,210  -->  00:11:02,340
is one column.

135

00:11:02,380  -->  00:11:03,920
C'mon they say me so much.

136

00:11:04,000  -->  00:11:05,590
So how would you fix this.

137

00:11:05,590  -->  00:11:14,230
Obviously you just put a quotation mark here quotation mark here and in the prepared data file.

138

00:11:14,230  -->  00:11:16,300
And that way this would all be

139

00:11:19,870  -->  00:11:23,710
perceived as one cell and put into one column.

140

00:11:23,710  -->  00:11:26,020
All right so that's how we would fix this one up.

141

00:11:26,080  -->  00:11:28,430
Was going to remove that and we'll just remember we are.

142

00:11:28,540  -->  00:11:30,060
That's how we fix that one up.

143

00:11:30,340  -->  00:11:31,190
OK.

144

00:11:31,480  -->  00:11:33,030
Let's go on to the next row.

145

00:11:33,040  -->  00:11:39,840
What's an row 3 5 0 0 1.

146

00:11:39,850  -->  00:11:43,070
There we go so that's 3 5 0 0 1.

147

00:11:43,210  -->  00:11:43,990
What can you see here.

148

00:11:43,990  -->  00:11:44,800
Thank you.

149

00:11:44,800  -->  00:11:46,810
Quotation marks starts and then nothing.

150

00:11:47,020  -->  00:11:49,330
So let's see what that turned into in this.

151

00:11:49,330  -->  00:11:52,110
Output 3 5 0 0 1.

152

00:11:52,150  -->  00:11:53,300
Thank you.

153

00:11:53,680  -->  00:12:00,700
And then it started eating up all this so this is where a column starts and it started eating up everything

154

00:12:00,700  -->  00:12:07,250
everything everything until there until that text qualifier and then excel thought OK so that's out

155

00:12:07,270  -->  00:12:09,550
of the column will start the next one here.

156

00:12:09,550  -->  00:12:11,910
All right so now let's see how this row ends.

157

00:12:11,920  -->  00:12:16,540
If you scroll to the end then something happened here with the credit card number because obviously

158

00:12:16,540  -->  00:12:22,840
it fell into the wrong field and then it was converted to these characters so there's something that

159

00:12:22,840  -->  00:12:28,090
you can fix as you can retrieve the text or the credit card number from there although you can fix it

160

00:12:28,270  -->  00:12:34,720
in your original file so if you original file you just put an extra quotation mark here and then this

161

00:12:34,720  -->  00:12:38,610
way all of this should be picked up properly.

162

00:12:38,650  -->  00:12:43,330
So once again you don't put this into you're prepared to fold a file because we finished that upload

163

00:12:43,930  -->  00:12:49,450
you create a new file and you prepare a file and then you upload and then you see if there are any other

164

00:12:49,450  -->  00:12:50,320
anomalies in the show.

165

00:12:50,320  -->  00:12:56,740
If not then maybe maybe just maybe you've managed to fix it so that your credit card number that got

166

00:12:56,980  -->  00:12:59,420
mangled up over here.

167

00:12:59,440  -->  00:12:59,820
All right.

168

00:12:59,830  -->  00:13:02,370
So I'm going to undo that.

169

00:13:03,310  -->  00:13:03,870
Thank you.

170

00:13:03,880  -->  00:13:04,600
OK.

171

00:13:04,600  -->  00:13:09,340
Next 1 3 5 0 0 2 right over here so what this person say.

172

00:13:09,730  -->  00:13:10,060
OK.

173

00:13:10,060  -->  00:13:11,170
Thank you kindly.

174

00:13:11,170  -->  00:13:12,320
No quotation marks.

175

00:13:12,360  -->  00:13:17,110
You know how that goes down that doesn't go down good at all.

176

00:13:17,110  -->  00:13:18,880
Two separate columns.

177

00:13:19,150  -->  00:13:19,520
All right.

178

00:13:19,540  -->  00:13:22,530
Well you know how to fix this quotation mark their quotation mark there.

179

00:13:22,600  -->  00:13:26,270
Once again fix is a very I'm using it very liberally.

180

00:13:26,500  -->  00:13:31,230
Maybe there are other issues in this role that you don't know about yet.

181

00:13:31,330  -->  00:13:39,010
And so by fix I mean you put those quotation marks in you creating your original file for maybe you

182

00:13:39,010  -->  00:13:40,630
can put all these rules together if you want.

183

00:13:40,630  -->  00:13:41,380
Once you've.

184

00:13:41,380  -->  00:13:46,200
You think you fix them and then you try uploading them and then you see how many go through.

185

00:13:46,420  -->  00:13:50,350
And then finally 4 5 9 4 7.

186

00:13:50,440  -->  00:13:51,900
Let's look for that.

187

00:13:52,420  -->  00:13:55,280
Oh whoops I think I skipped it.

188

00:13:55,350  -->  00:13:58,230
Is that again.

189

00:13:58,300  -->  00:13:58,950
There it is.

190

00:13:59,110  -->  00:13:59,340
OK.

191

00:13:59,350  -->  00:14:01,630
4 5 9 4 7.

192

00:14:01,630  -->  00:14:07,720
Let's scroll that see what the Coleman says and voila there's no comment.

193

00:14:07,810  -->  00:14:09,580
So this one's a bit more interesting right.

194

00:14:09,580  -->  00:14:11,390
So what happened here.

195

00:14:11,500  -->  00:14:12,810
There is no comment.

196

00:14:12,850  -->  00:14:15,600
How come there is an anomaly.

197

00:14:15,670  -->  00:14:16,950
Why.

198

00:14:17,230  -->  00:14:23,990
Why is it skewed so if you go to the end of this file you will see what we see here.

199

00:14:24,400  -->  00:14:32,800
Well you see these rows and I think you don't see an empty row at the end so there should be an empty

200

00:14:32,800  -->  00:14:34,720
row so that means it will skew to the right.

201

00:14:34,720  -->  00:14:37,310
If you look at the end here.

202

00:14:38,860  -->  00:14:40,920
OK so what can we say about this fall.

203

00:14:40,930  -->  00:14:42,310
Well let's just keep looking at this.

204

00:14:42,300  -->  00:14:44,650
Look keep looking through it and see what could have happened.

205

00:14:44,660  -->  00:14:47,790
So nothing nothing nothing.

206

00:14:48,220  -->  00:14:58,180
And do you see anything like that that other records don't have anything there or have a quotation mark

207

00:14:58,180  -->  00:14:58,360
.

208

00:14:58,480  -->  00:15:00,760
You know maybe that's just the record so that's fine.

209

00:15:00,770  -->  00:15:03,860
Let's just keep looking maybe we just keep that in mind.

210

00:15:04,360  -->  00:15:09,550
And then when you get to the end you see that there is a quotation mark here just like this one has

211

00:15:09,550  -->  00:15:11,190
a quotation mark.

212

00:15:11,290  -->  00:15:15,690
So it's basically the same same record.

213

00:15:15,790  -->  00:15:17,010
These two things are the same.

214

00:15:17,020  -->  00:15:18,940
But here you go double quotation marks.

215

00:15:18,940  -->  00:15:20,130
You go to a single.

216

00:15:20,230  -->  00:15:24,590
So somehow the double irritation Mark turned into a single quotation mark.

217

00:15:24,610  -->  00:15:30,310
And therefore this whole thing has been messed up.

218

00:15:30,310  -->  00:15:31,580
How has it been messed up.

219

00:15:31,720  -->  00:15:34,530
Well the only reason be messed up is because of this comma.

220

00:15:34,660  -->  00:15:38,290
So basically one excel or any other program gets to this point.

221

00:15:38,460  -->  00:15:43,420
They're like OK so that's that's our browser that was used.

222

00:15:43,570  -->  00:15:45,140
That goes into the browser column.

223

00:15:45,250  -->  00:15:52,300
And then this goes into the next column where the number of telephone number should be so that's how

224

00:15:52,570  -->  00:15:53,800
this Rugel skew to the right.

225

00:15:53,800  -->  00:15:55,570
So how would you fix this.

226

00:15:55,930  -->  00:16:00,320
Well you would change this to a double quotation mark.

227

00:16:00,870  -->  00:16:03,730
There you go so that's some basic analysis.

228

00:16:03,730  -->  00:16:09,910
Once again you don't have to fix the roads yourself and preferably you shouldn't but but maybe analyzing

229

00:16:09,910  -->  00:16:16,950
them can help you guide the person that is the custodian of the data to what you think happened to these

230

00:16:16,950  -->  00:16:18,040
roads.

231

00:16:18,850  -->  00:16:23,680
So that is the end for today we are getting close to the end of the section.

232

00:16:23,680  -->  00:16:24,850
Hope you're enjoying it.

233

00:16:24,850  -->  00:16:30,880
I know it's very very tedious lots of working with data but that's that's the reality of things and

234

00:16:30,880  -->  00:16:37,300
sometimes as the scientists you to do that the information that we talked about in this section will

235

00:16:37,300  -->  00:16:40,400
be helpful for you in your homework.
