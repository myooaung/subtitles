00:00:01.560  -->  00:00:07.590
What is it T.L. today will talk about the e-tail step in the door a journey from raw data to insights

2

00:00:07.600  -->  00:00:08.110
.

3

00:00:08.100  -->  00:00:12.240
It is an abbreviation for extract transform load.

4

00:00:12.360  -->  00:00:17.080
Now the data you want to analyze may be stored in a number of locations.

5

00:00:17.250  -->  00:00:25.800
For instance a database an Excel spreadsheet a web site Twitter is cxxviii file Ajay's saan file and

6

00:00:25.800  -->  00:00:28.220
these are just a few examples.

7

00:00:28.440  -->  00:00:31.740
You could try to analyze the data directly in a storage facility.

8

00:00:31.740  -->  00:00:38.370
If that is possible and certainly you could do that for quick ad hoc calculations such as the sum of

9

00:00:38.370  -->  00:00:39.890
a column in Excel.

10

00:00:39.900  -->  00:00:45.230
However for serious data science and Big Data Projects this is a big red flag.

11

00:00:45.630  -->  00:00:50.550
Analyzing data in the source can create myriads of problems and poses lots of threats.

12

00:00:50.550  -->  00:00:56.250
For instance you could accidentally modify the underlying raw data and jeopardize all of your work.

13

00:00:56.430  -->  00:00:58.320
And that is just the best case scenario.

14

00:00:58.380  -->  00:01:03.690
In the worst case you could severely impact the critical business process and crash one of the internal

15

00:01:03.690  -->  00:01:04.780
systems.

16

00:01:05.070  -->  00:01:09.960
What we will learn in this course is how to take this data and put it into a warehouse.

17

00:01:10.230  -->  00:01:16.170
As we discussed a warehouse is a relational database designed specifically to store data for analysis

18

00:01:16.170  -->  00:01:16.840
.

19

00:01:16.860  -->  00:01:19.890
However you cannot put the data directly into the warehouse.

20

00:01:19.890  -->  00:01:24.270
You need to remove anomalies bring it to the right format and so on.

21

00:01:24.510  -->  00:01:30.330
As you can see this is a three step process and the names for the steps are extract transform and load

22

00:01:30.330  -->  00:01:30.820
.

23

00:01:30.840  -->  00:01:32.910
It may sound a bit overwhelming right now.

24

00:01:32.910  -->  00:01:39.240
However as you will see in its nature this is a very straightforward process and even though a lot of

25

00:01:39.270  -->  00:01:44.820
analysts and data scientists struggle of detail that is simply because they don't have any specific

26

00:01:44.820  -->  00:01:49.080
framework to follow and they reinvent the wheel every time.

27

00:01:49.110  -->  00:01:51.950
That's one of the gaps This course will help you cover.

28

00:01:52.170  -->  00:01:57.330
I will give you a tried and tested framework and I will teach you how to use it in your work.

29

00:01:57.330  -->  00:01:59.730
Going forward it will seem like cakewalk
