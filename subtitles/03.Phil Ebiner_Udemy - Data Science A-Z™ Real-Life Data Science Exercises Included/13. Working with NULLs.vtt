00:00:00.780  -->  00:00:07.850
Today will learn how to work with Nalls now no all in school means an empty cell.

2

00:00:07.880  -->  00:00:14.760
It doesn't mean where the cell is a just a blank element of text.

3

00:00:14.760  -->  00:00:17.340
It actually means there is no dot in that cell.

4

00:00:17.340  -->  00:00:23.330
And the way We've uploaded our data we don't have any new tools in our tables as you can see.

5

00:00:23.340  -->  00:00:24.690
Everything is populated.

6

00:00:24.840  -->  00:00:27.450
And even if we had an empty string.

7

00:00:27.450  -->  00:00:31.320
So just two quotation marks it would still be just an empty string.

8

00:00:31.320  -->  00:00:37.020
That means it's an empty string rather than there's no data available for that cell.

9

00:00:37.020  -->  00:00:41.040
So to understand a bit better let's introduce some nulls into our data.

10

00:00:41.070  -->  00:00:45.880
This is the order breakdown table so I've selected all the rows not just the top thousand.

11

00:00:45.880  -->  00:00:46.940
Just all of them.

12

00:00:47.250  -->  00:00:57.570
And what's I'm going to do next is I'm going to add a funeral's in here so the way to do it is let's

13

00:00:57.570  -->  00:01:02.790
make some space and just type in the following code.

14

00:01:02.790  -->  00:01:04.920
It starts with update.

15

00:01:04.920  -->  00:01:13.320
Then you don't really need this bit if you using used as training so update your table then set discount

16

00:01:13.500  -->  00:01:17.490
equals Noul where discount equals 0.5.

17

00:01:17.490  -->  00:01:23.350
So basically we're taking all the rows with open 5 and we're replacing discount WITHNALL.

18

00:01:23.490  -->  00:01:30.680
So once you've typed that up just highlight it and execute just as bit by itself.

19

00:01:31.650  -->  00:01:33.890
984 those affected.

20

00:01:34.050  -->  00:01:40.800
And now let's let's highlight this part and execute it.

21

00:01:40.800  -->  00:01:46.740
And for now I will actually take this code and I will comment it out because we won't be needing it

22

00:01:46.740  -->  00:01:49.500
right now.

23

00:01:49.500  -->  00:01:55.230
So what you see in your daughter now is that everywhere where there was a discount of 0.5 now there

24

00:01:55.230  -->  00:01:55.780
is law.

25

00:01:55.920  -->  00:01:58.940
And that basically means that there's no data for that cell.

26

00:01:58.950  -->  00:01:59.850
We don't know if it's.

27

00:02:00.090  -->  00:02:04.630
And it's an empty cell if it's a discount of 0.7.

28

00:02:04.710  -->  00:02:10.370
If you know it's there was no discount at all it is just it's just a little.

29

00:02:10.380  -->  00:02:11.840
So you can say anything about it.

30

00:02:11.850  -->  00:02:17.540
And that's why we've created this tutorial because we're clear of Newell's is a bit different to working

31

00:02:17.550  -->  00:02:18.870
if anything else.

32

00:02:19.230  -->  00:02:22.710
You can't you can't perform the same operations with them.

33

00:02:22.860  -->  00:02:28.720
So for instance let's say I want to find out which rows have a discount or no.

34

00:02:28.740  -->  00:02:34.160
So what would you type you would type obviously a table here you would type select from and then you

35

00:02:34.160  -->  00:02:40.840
would go where discount equals.

36

00:02:40.880  -->  00:02:41.190
Right.

37

00:02:41.190  -->  00:02:44.870
So if there was any other value you would say discount equals.

38

00:02:45.000  -->  00:02:45.480
Let's try.

39

00:02:45.480  -->  00:02:47.220
Let's start off 0.6.

40

00:02:47.220  -->  00:02:48.730
Let's find where the discussion was.

41

00:02:48.780  -->  00:02:52.690
Point 6 you execute that you get all of the discounts 0.6.

42

00:02:52.770  -->  00:02:59.310
But now if I wanted to type in null here and execute what I get I get nothing I get I don't get an error

43

00:02:59.370  -->  00:03:00.810
but I get nothing.

44

00:03:00.840  -->  00:03:01.460
Why.

45

00:03:01.620  -->  00:03:07.080
Well because a normal is a completely different thing.

46

00:03:07.080  -->  00:03:16.530
It's not a number it's not a value it's something else and you cannot compare a lot tunel so you can

47

00:03:16.530  -->  00:03:17.730
say.

48

00:03:17.830  -->  00:03:19.560
And a discount equals no.

49

00:03:19.590  -->  00:03:20.910
Then show me those values.

50

00:03:20.910  -->  00:03:26.430
No because I know all is not equal to an all and also knew it was naughty not not equal to and also

51

00:03:26.430  -->  00:03:30.530
if I put a not equal sign here.

52

00:03:31.410  -->  00:03:36.120
That's how you write a not equal sign in as well and execute that same thing.

53

00:03:36.120  -->  00:03:41.140
You get nothing because you cannot compare tonal and that's something you should be aware of.

54

00:03:41.220  -->  00:03:46.440
The way to compare to know is you should sort of equals you should type in is

55

00:03:49.260  -->  00:03:50.740
and execute that way.

56

00:03:50.910  -->  00:03:54.130
So where discount is no.

57

00:03:54.330  -->  00:04:00.830
That way you pick up all of the Nalls rules here in the discount column and the way to compare us with

58

00:04:00.840  -->  00:04:02.240
something that's not a no.

59

00:04:02.250  -->  00:04:03.860
Then you type in is not.

60

00:04:03.900  -->  00:04:04.570
No.

61

00:04:05.010  -->  00:04:12.130
If you execute now you get all of the disk of all of the rows where discount is not a no.

62

00:04:12.750  -->  00:04:15.450
So those are the basics of working with Nalls.

63

00:04:15.450  -->  00:04:22.020
We shouldn't have too many of them in this course if any at all you will as a data scientist come across

64

00:04:22.020  -->  00:04:29.610
them and just be aware of these things that they are a bit different to normal values and you'll be

65

00:04:29.610  -->  00:04:35.310
very comfortable if Nalls very quickly they're easy so if you ever come across them in a specific scenario

66

00:04:36.000  -->  00:04:39.060
and you don't really know what to do just you can just look that up.

67

00:04:39.060  -->  00:04:41.760
It's very very quick.

68

00:04:41.790  -->  00:04:48.180
Every single time the solution will be simple because Nalls a very very simple to work with just they

69

00:04:48.180  -->  00:04:51.920
have their own specifics and you just need to be aware of them.

70

00:04:51.930  -->  00:04:56.320
And this one is the probably the major one that you cannot compare anything to know.

71

00:04:56.520  -->  00:04:59.450
And you always get empty values.

72

00:04:59.460  -->  00:05:02.460
So you have to use is no and is not.

73

00:05:02.490  -->  00:05:03.310
No.
