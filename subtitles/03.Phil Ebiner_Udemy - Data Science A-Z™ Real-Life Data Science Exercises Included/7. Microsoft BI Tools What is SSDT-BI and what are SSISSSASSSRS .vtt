00:00:01.110  -->  00:00:06.110
In this tutorial we will explore business intelligence tools for all e-tail process.

2

00:00:06.120  -->  00:00:13.230
We will rely on Sosias for ss d t be-I with M-S vs shell.

3

00:00:13.230  -->  00:00:14.890
Sounds confusing right.

4

00:00:14.910  -->  00:00:17.700
Actually as you will see just now it's very easy.

5

00:00:17.820  -->  00:00:23.340
And by the way after this tutorial you will be an expert in Microsoft acronyms so there is something

6

00:00:23.340  -->  00:00:25.270
to look forward to.

7

00:00:25.290  -->  00:00:32.940
Let's look at the acronyms one by one MSP S stands for Microsoft Visual Studio and it looks like this

8

00:00:32.940  -->  00:00:33.450
.

9

00:00:33.480  -->  00:00:38.770
In case you haven't heard of Visual Studio before it's a great software where you can program in C++

10

00:00:38.790  -->  00:00:42.430
C-Sharp create apps build software and much more.

11

00:00:42.450  -->  00:00:44.060
We won't be needing all of that.

12

00:00:44.070  -->  00:00:49.220
We will only require the business intelligence tools in Visual Studio.

13

00:00:49.230  -->  00:00:50.280
Think of it this way.

14

00:00:50.370  -->  00:00:55.600
For working with the database we use a secure server management studio.

15

00:00:55.620  -->  00:01:00.510
Similarly we will be using Visual Studio for managing our e-tail process.

16

00:01:00.900  -->  00:01:05.280
The reason it's called Shell is because we will be using the full Visual Studio.

17

00:01:05.370  -->  00:01:11.190
The shell contains just enough user interface to allow us to work with the B package.

18

00:01:11.220  -->  00:01:13.830
All right so we've sorted out the MSVS abbreviation.

19

00:01:13.860  -->  00:01:16.230
Let's look at the next one.

20

00:01:16.230  -->  00:01:21.800
S as d TBI stands for sequel server daughter tools business intelligence.

21

00:01:22.050  -->  00:01:25.330
Some fun facts about ss d TBI.

22

00:01:25.470  -->  00:01:31.260
It was previously called bits which stands for business intelligence development studio.

23

00:01:31.350  -->  00:01:34.740
Then Microsoft changed the name to ss d TBI.

24

00:01:34.980  -->  00:01:42.120
However as the TBI is not the same thing as simply as as dirty as it is used for building databases

25

00:01:42.150  -->  00:01:47.370
it comes with this Consolacion SSD TBI is for building SOSIAS.

26

00:01:47.370  -->  00:01:53.490
SS as an SSR as solutions what I meant about Microsoft acronyms.

27

00:01:53.880  -->  00:02:00.850
By the way you will quite often see SS at the start of an abbreviation usually stands for Sequel studio

28

00:02:00.870  -->  00:02:01.110
.

29

00:02:01.380  -->  00:02:03.500
And this leads us to the next screen shot.

30

00:02:03.690  -->  00:02:08.430
This is how SS The TBI looks like inside Microsoft Visual Studio.

31

00:02:08.430  -->  00:02:14.430
As you can see here it has three components analysis services integration services and reporting services

32

00:02:14.430  -->  00:02:14.760
.

33

00:02:14.760  -->  00:02:17.190
Let's have a look at them in more detail.

34

00:02:17.190  -->  00:02:25.830
The three components of SS The TBI SS A-S is then Alliss services and it's used for analyzing data Sosias

35

00:02:25.920  -->  00:02:32.850
is integration services and it's used for the e-tail process and SRS is the reporting services and it's

36

00:02:32.850  -->  00:02:36.820
used for visualizing data the components eliciting of the medical order.

37

00:02:36.960  -->  00:02:40.360
Let's put them on a diagram so it all makes more sense.

38

00:02:40.590  -->  00:02:45.000
Here's a diagram which takes raw data and converts into insides.

39

00:02:45.000  -->  00:02:48.840
This journey has four steps Sosias fits in at the start.

40

00:02:48.840  -->  00:02:50.640
When we do they eat pale face.

41

00:02:50.700  -->  00:02:58.590
Then once the data is in the database we would use SS A-S to analyze it and s s r s to visualize it

42

00:02:58.590  -->  00:02:59.460
.

43

00:02:59.490  -->  00:03:05.280
That's Microsoft's proposed approach and a lot of be-I departments in organizations worldwide use these

44

00:03:05.280  -->  00:03:06.380
exact tools.

45

00:03:06.390  -->  00:03:10.500
In fact maybe even your company's be-I team works like that.

46

00:03:10.500  -->  00:03:16.390
However as data scientists we have different objectives which cannot be met with just these tools.

47

00:03:16.410  -->  00:03:20.260
We need more sophisticated tools tailored to our type of work.

48

00:03:20.460  -->  00:03:27.760
That's why in the Analise step instead of SS A-S we would be using tools like our Python and so on.

49

00:03:27.960  -->  00:03:33.930
And in the visualized step instead of SS arest we would use much more powerful exhiliration tools like

50

00:03:33.930  -->  00:03:35.130
Tablo.

51

00:03:35.700  -->  00:03:37.290
However there is some good news.

52

00:03:37.290  -->  00:03:41.270
SS Ayas meets our requirements for the e-tail process just fine.

53

00:03:41.400  -->  00:03:43.350
And that's why we will stick with it.

54

00:03:43.890  -->  00:03:53.130
And to sum up for today we will be using an M-S vs shell to run SSD TBI because we need Sosias to perform

55

00:03:53.130  -->  00:03:54.390
our e-tail.

56

00:03:54.390  -->  00:04:00.120
Hope you are much more comfortable with these acronyms now and in the next tutorial we will install

57

00:04:00.630  -->  00:04:03.150
the MSBA shell with SSD TBI
