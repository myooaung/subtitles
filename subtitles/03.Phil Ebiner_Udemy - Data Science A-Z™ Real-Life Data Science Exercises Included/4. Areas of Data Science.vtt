00:00:01.020  -->  00:00:06.570
Domiciles domains and Tauriel We will talk about the great variety of disciplines that data science

2

00:00:06.570  -->  00:00:12.270
encompasses and you probably are familiar with this Venn diagram which portrays data science as the

3

00:00:12.330  -->  00:00:16.310
Intersect of three worlds computer science maths and domain knowledge.

4

00:00:16.410  -->  00:00:21.270
By the way here by domain knowledge we mean the intrinsic knowledge you develop about the business or

5

00:00:21.270  -->  00:00:23.420
industry you work in.

6

00:00:23.430  -->  00:00:28.560
Also you might have already heard the definition that a data scientist is a person who is better at

7

00:00:28.560  -->  00:00:34.380
statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician though

8

00:00:34.380  -->  00:00:36.930
amusing these definitions are very outdated.

9

00:00:37.110  -->  00:00:39.160
Their days have passed long ago.

10

00:00:39.360  -->  00:00:45.720
A modern data scientist is expected to be proficient in many more disciplines and has to possess way

11

00:00:45.720  -->  00:00:48.390
more skills than just programming on stats.

12

00:00:48.390  -->  00:00:50.710
Personally I really like this picture.

13

00:00:50.730  -->  00:00:56.280
How about we use it as a starting point in our quest to find out what data science actually is.

14

00:00:56.640  -->  00:01:02.430
Starting from the top statistics because data science and was working with data and hard facts all the

15

00:01:02.430  -->  00:01:03.120
time.

16

00:01:03.180  -->  00:01:06.900
You have to be able to separate random noise from actual trends.

17

00:01:06.900  -->  00:01:12.120
Also you need to know how to build models that classify populations and provide reliable forecasts of

18

00:01:12.120  -->  00:01:17.800
future events viz. humans don't speak in ones and zeros.

19

00:01:17.940  -->  00:01:20.560
A data scientist has to be able to see.

20

00:01:20.760  -->  00:01:24.120
And what's even more important to show it to others.

21

00:01:24.120  -->  00:01:28.080
This is why visualization is not only an art form but also crucial skill.

22

00:01:28.080  -->  00:01:34.650
You have to have in your arsenal data mining along with fossilisation data mining is the creative part

23

00:01:34.650  -->  00:01:40.110
of your work interrogating daughter looking for trends looking for anomalies finding things that have

24

00:01:40.110  -->  00:01:41.940
never ever been seen before.

25

00:01:41.940  -->  00:01:47.640
This is where you put your Sherlock Holmes hat on database and data process.

26

00:01:47.640  -->  00:01:52.920
This involves everything from cleaning of data to storage and manipulation.

27

00:01:52.920  -->  00:01:55.890
It's like knowing how to hold a book and to turn pages.

28

00:01:55.890  -->  00:02:01.550
If you cannot perform these basic tasks then you'll never get to read the story.

29

00:02:01.590  -->  00:02:07.260
Now these three pattern recognition machine learning and neuroplasticity are separate here but personally

30

00:02:07.260  -->  00:02:08.590
I would put them all together.

31

00:02:08.610  -->  00:02:10.070
They all care to one goal.

32

00:02:10.120  -->  00:02:14.540
Teaching computers how to learn without being explicitly programmed.

33

00:02:14.640  -->  00:02:19.680
This is quite an advanced realm for a dollar scientist and this is where you go once you've gotten quite

34

00:02:19.680  -->  00:02:25.620
proficient at all of the other areas that we've covered off and moreover not every data scientist has

35

00:02:25.620  -->  00:02:31.950
to go down this pathway because this is a very specific set of skills that's applicable to certain business

36

00:02:32.220  -->  00:02:34.220
problems and challenges.

37

00:02:34.290  -->  00:02:38.640
Now we've discussed everything on this picture but I think that even that is not enough.

38

00:02:38.640  -->  00:02:41.090
There are a few things that I would add.

39

00:02:41.100  -->  00:02:42.480
Number one communication.

40

00:02:42.480  -->  00:02:46.400
A data scientist has to interact with people on a daily basis.

41

00:02:46.440  -->  00:02:48.270
Not all incise are in the data.

42

00:02:48.270  -->  00:02:54.270
Some things you can only learn from people who are working with that data and I will show you some vivid

43

00:02:54.270  -->  00:02:57.090
examples of this further down in the course.

44

00:02:57.090  -->  00:03:02.040
Therefore Adonal scientists who cannot talk to a human being for longer than five minutes is not setting

45

00:03:02.040  -->  00:03:05.360
himself up for success regardless of how smart he is.

46

00:03:05.370  -->  00:03:09.900
You have to be an outgoing person to be successful in this profession.

47

00:03:10.200  -->  00:03:14.820
Presentation and another form of talking with people only this time it's other way around.

48

00:03:14.950  -->  00:03:17.950
Are trying to put information into their heads.

49

00:03:17.970  -->  00:03:23.100
I believe that this is one of the most important skills of a data scientist if not the most important

50

00:03:23.100  -->  00:03:28.890
one because apart from having all the other expertise we already talked about a modern art a scientist

51

00:03:29.130  -->  00:03:32.340
is the gatekeeper between insights and people.

52

00:03:32.340  -->  00:03:37.860
You can derive thousands and millions of valuable business insights but if you cannot effectively communicate

53

00:03:37.860  -->  00:03:42.990
them to the key decision makers then those insights are worth nothing.

54

00:03:43.380  -->  00:03:44.590
Domain knowledge.

55

00:03:44.610  -->  00:03:50.360
Personally I admire dollar signs so much because it is an extremely transferable set of skills.

56

00:03:50.370  -->  00:03:54.680
One day you are searching for fraudulent transactions in a large mining corporation.

57

00:03:54.780  -->  00:03:59.560
The next day you're building eram your model for the employees of a medical facility.

58

00:03:59.730  -->  00:04:06.000
Quite likely the data scientist is the only employee who can adapt to a new organization and even industry

59

00:04:06.030  -->  00:04:07.650
so quickly.

60

00:04:07.650  -->  00:04:12.900
And funnily enough this example shows that she can be a successful data scientist even with far domain

61

00:04:12.900  -->  00:04:13.780
knowledge.

62

00:04:13.780  -->  00:04:18.420
However domain knowledge does add to your capacity to deliver insights.

63

00:04:18.540  -->  00:04:22.830
You just have to do your research and develop the bulk of this domain knowledge very quickly and the

64

00:04:22.830  -->  00:04:29.860
rest of it will come as you are working in this industry or in this company reallife practice the same

65

00:04:29.850  -->  00:04:29.880
.

66

00:04:29.880  -->  00:04:32.040
Practice makes perfect says it all.

67

00:04:32.040  -->  00:04:36.340
This concept is extremely applicable to Dallasites programming.

68

00:04:36.420  -->  00:04:41.400
Another important part of data assigns the better you can talk to a machine the more efficient and more

69

00:04:41.400  -->  00:04:43.350
successful you will be.

70

00:04:43.350  -->  00:04:47.060
If you haven't yet start learning programming today it should become a hobby.

71

00:04:47.060  -->  00:04:50.390
It should be something that's just a natural part of your life.

72

00:04:50.700  -->  00:04:52.060
And finally creativity.

73

00:04:52.140  -->  00:04:53.580
You have to be creative.

74

00:04:53.670  -->  00:04:59.860
If you can generate new ideas you might find yourself stuck as a data analyst forever to become a great

75

00:04:59.860  -->  00:05:01.110
doubt a scientist.

76

00:05:01.110  -->  00:05:03.470
You have to cultivate creativity inside yourself.

77

00:05:03.570  -->  00:05:09.090
Allow your curiosity to guide you and help you find insights that nobody thought you would ever find

78

00:05:09.090  -->  00:05:09.850
.

79

00:05:09.900  -->  00:05:14.700
Those are the main disciplines and qualities that I would add to this list and to finish off let's see

80

00:05:14.850  -->  00:05:22.710
what we will cover off in the course statistics visualization data mining data base and data preparation

81

00:05:22.920  -->  00:05:29.140
communication presentation creativity programming and real life practice.

82

00:05:29.140  -->  00:05:31.360
He'll definitely have a lot of that last one.

83

00:05:31.590  -->  00:05:35.950
And as you will see some of these will cover off in more depth some and less.

84

00:05:36.030  -->  00:05:42.060
But in any case here you will develop a great foundation for your data science career and in the next

85

00:05:42.060  -->  00:05:48.000
tutorial we will expand on this a little more and I will show you the exact pathways you can take in

86

00:05:48.000  -->  00:05:48.680
this course.

87

00:05:48.840  -->  00:05:53.370
It's an important tutorial because it'll help you shape your learning journey the way you wanted.

88

00:05:53.370  -->  00:05:55.100
So make sure you don't miss out on it.

89

00:05:55.140  -->  00:05:57.320
And I look forward to seeing you there.
