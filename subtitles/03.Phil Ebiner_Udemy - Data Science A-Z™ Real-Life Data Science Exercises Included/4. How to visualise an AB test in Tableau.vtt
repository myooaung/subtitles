00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.150
In this tutorial I will show you how to run simple A-B tests in Tableau.
1

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.560
And as you will see they will be extremely visual just like everything else in Tableau to start off we're
2

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.860
going to save the name of this worksheet and I'm going to call it map so that we can remember what exactly
3

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.260
it contains.
4

5
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.010
Now I'm going to go to file and I'm going to save the whole workbook.
5

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.900
So I'm going to click save as and I'm going to call my workbook "data mining" and I'll save it into the same
6

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.880
folder as the data set.
7

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.220
And by the way, if you're using Tableau public the free version of Tablo then you will have to save your
8

9
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.680
workbook to the Tableau public servers but that's not a problem because we're not working with sensitive
9

10
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.160
data here.
10

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.050
This is all mockup data.
11

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.710
So now what we're going to do is create a new tab or a worksheet and in this worksheet we're going to
12

13
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.010
run a very first AB test in Tableau.
13

14
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.160
So the first thing we need is the dependent variable that we're examining which is exit.
14

15
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.650
Did the person leave or not.
15

16
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.020
And as we can see it's in measures at the moment.
16

17
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.930
So Tableau has recognized this column as a measure meaning that it's looking at it as a number rather
17

18
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.800
than as a category for us exited is actually a category.
18

19
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.120
Did the person leave or not.
19

20
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.490
So it's basically a flag.
20

21
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.150
And that's why we need to move it into dimensions.
21

22
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.050
It is going to drag it into dimensions as we saw in the previous section of the course.
22

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:34.110
And now we have the exited flag here and we can start constructing our AB test and I will show you a
23

24
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.280
step by step method to perform this visualization of an AB test.
24

25
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.160
So let's get started.
25

26
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.910
The classic and most commonly used example when AB test is an AB test for gender.
26

27
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.900
So how about we run one of those four hour data set.
27

28
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.510
And basically what we'll be testing is if we hold everything else equal and we take a male customer
28

29
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.250
and a female customer which one of them is more likely to exit.
29

30
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.510
So let's take gender and we will drag gender on to columns.
30

31
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.430
Now we got two columns of male and female.
31

32
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.600
Now what we want to do is take exited and drag it onto color.
32

33
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.030
This gives us two colors 0 blue for zero meaning people who did not exit an orange for one.
33

34
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.060
Meaning people who did exit and now we're going to take a number of records because we want to see how
34

35
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.970
many people actually left and we will drag a number of records into our rows.
35

36
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.790
So I'm going to move this up a little bit so that we have some space.
36

37
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.100
So what you can see here is there is more males than females and of the females.
37

38
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.050
Quite a large portion left of the males a small portion left.
38

39
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.160
However this is not sufficient for us to understand what exactly is happening and we have to fix this
39

40
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.250
up a little bit to visualize the AB test.
40

41
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.560
First of all let's add the total number of records as a label We already know how to do that and we'll
41

42
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.010
take number of records and dragged into label and let's increase the font of the label so we can actually
42

43
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.240
see it, right?
43

44
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.370
Make it bold.
44

45
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.760
There we go.
45

46
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.690
So that's how many records we have in each of these boxes.
46

47
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.470
Now what we want to do is we want to replace the actual number of records with a percentage.
47

48
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.670
So we want to see rather than the absolute value of female customers that left and left these ones left
48

49
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.620
in the orange bar and the ones that stayed.
49

50
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.800
We want to see the percentage So what percentage of female customers left and what percentage of male
50

51
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.430
customers left because that way we'll be able to compare them to each other.
51

52
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.160
Right now we can't compare them because there is a different number of total customers in each of these
52

53
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.170
groups in order to convert these absolute values into percentages.
53

54
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.850
We need to go to the dropdown menu of this some number of records.
54

55
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.240
Now here we need to select Add table calculation.
55

56
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:09.210
Once you select a table calculation we need a percentage of total And here an important step is to change
56

57
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.080
from table across to table down.
57

58
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.680
And what that will do is will give us a percentage of total in each column.
58

59
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.210
So we click OK.
59

60
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.730
And as you can see the number has changed.
60

61
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.030
What we'll do now is we will format the label so we'll right click will go to format and will change
61

62
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.480
this to percentage just to zero decimal places.
62

63
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.760
And finally to make this consistent what we're going to do is we're going to take some number of records
63

64
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.890
table calculation and you can see that there is a table calculation by this little triangle that has
64

65
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:50.820
appeared on the right and we will call hold on control and we'll drag it to replace existing some number
65

66
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.210
of records in the rows area.
66

67
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.810
What that does is now it's consistent.
67

68
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:04.430
And even the access over here represents the percentage before it was just the absolute value.
68

69
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.870
But now the height of the bar and the label inside the bar are actual light.
69

70
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.400
And so let's analyze this for a second.
70

71
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:21.780
From here we can see right away that irrespective of the number of female and male customers the percentage
71

72
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.220
of male customers that left the bank is only 16 percent and that is less than the percentage of female
72

73
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.660
customers that left the bank.
73

74
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.900
So the conclusion that we can make from here is that female customers are more likely to leave the bank
74

75
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.460
than male customers.
75

76
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.800
All other things held equal.
76

77
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.110
And bear in mind that this is not the full statistical AB test because we did not check for statistical
77

78
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.220
significance.
78

79
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:54.090
However this is a very quick and convenient and visual approach which can give you very fast results
79

80
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.120
.
80

81
00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.630
And then if you find something of interest you can go and investigate it further and do the proper statistical AB
81

82
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.910
test check for significance and things like that.
82

83
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.400
But personally I really like this approach.
83

84
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.820
I like this method because it helps me focus on things that actually matter and not waste my time on
84

85
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.420
variables that don't actually affect my end result.
85

86
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.000
So we'll be doing lots more of these in this section.
86

87
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:24.840
Hope this framework is useful and you will see how powerful it is as we go through the tutorials that
87

88
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.050
are ahead of us.
88

89
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.260
I look forward to see you next time.
89

90
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.830
And until then happy analyzing
