00:00:01,150  -->  00:00:05,600
Pillow ladies and gentleman and today we're starting a fun bit.

2

00:00:05,610  -->  00:00:07,100
We're going to upload our data.

3

00:00:07,320  -->  00:00:12,030
So let's quickly go to our data science project and we're dealing with fake names.

4

00:00:12,030  -->  00:00:18,960
Canada which we put in here in the previous tutorial so original data there is our file.

5

00:00:18,960  -->  00:00:25,260
Are we going to copy this file before we open it and we're going to put it into a prepared data and

6

00:00:25,260  -->  00:00:26,810
we'll look at it here.

7

00:00:27,300  -->  00:00:29,640
So let's open it up in a notepad.

8

00:00:29,640  -->  00:00:31,610
Plus plus to start off with.

9

00:00:31,920  -->  00:00:33,280
What does the file look like.

10

00:00:33,570  -->  00:00:34,270
Wow.

11

00:00:34,320  -->  00:00:36,870
It's very different to what we expected.

12

00:00:36,960  -->  00:00:39,790
It's not a comma separated file.

13

00:00:39,840  -->  00:00:42,320
It's a tab delimited file.

14

00:00:42,330  -->  00:00:44,700
So here are the delimiters tabs.

15

00:00:44,940  -->  00:00:51,400
And be careful of these files because here it's much harder to understand what is going on because there's

16

00:00:51,420  -->  00:00:52,650
no commas.

17

00:00:52,650  -->  00:00:57,530
Still you have those text qualifiers to separate the commas from the rest of the world.

18

00:00:57,600  -->  00:01:01,560
But in this case the commas aren't actually the delimiters.

19

00:01:01,560  -->  00:01:10,290
The tabs are delimiters So very interesting format and be careful with that because it's a good example

20

00:01:10,290  -->  00:01:10,600
.

21

00:01:10,680  -->  00:01:17,460
There are different types of delimiters pipelined delimit pipe delimited files comma separated tab delimited

22

00:01:17,730  -->  00:01:19,250
semi-colon delimited.

23

00:01:19,350  -->  00:01:21,500
You can pretty much use anything as delimiter.

24

00:01:21,600  -->  00:01:27,450
So in your homework at the end of this section in the super hardcore homework you will have a surprise

25

00:01:27,450  -->  00:01:34,400
delimiter which won't be a comma or a tab so be careful that you will have to figure out how to deal

26

00:01:34,440  -->  00:01:36,180
of that run on your own.

27

00:01:36,270  -->  00:01:41,450
And now what we're going to do is we're going to close this file and we will proceed with Excel.

28

00:01:41,460  -->  00:01:48,090
But first before that we do we have to check the number of rows there is two hundred thousand rows in

29

00:01:48,090  -->  00:01:52,640
this file including the head of the 200000 and one.

30

00:01:52,650  -->  00:01:58,320
So just checking to make sure that Excel will be capable of opening this file Excel can manage files

31

00:01:58,320  -->  00:02:04,700
up to 1 million for forty eight thousand and 576 rows I think.

32

00:02:04,710  -->  00:02:11,650
So let's close that and proceed with our bulletproof blueprint.

33

00:02:11,910  -->  00:02:16,890
OK so we're going to open the file now by looking at all files fake names.

34

00:02:16,890  -->  00:02:23,760
Canada to exceed that forces the text import wizard which we want delimited by default it's tab.

35

00:02:23,790  -->  00:02:30,600
So if I change to comma here you'll see that it's messed up the file so leave it a tab.

36

00:02:30,600  -->  00:02:33,960
Once again you have to be careful know what your delimiter is.

37

00:02:33,960  -->  00:02:36,810
Next select all the columns.

38

00:02:36,900  -->  00:02:38,360
Change them to text.

39

00:02:38,430  -->  00:02:39,940
Finish.

40

00:02:40,670  -->  00:02:43,700
OK so there is our file.

41

00:02:43,890  -->  00:02:48,600
And one interesting thing we can see in our way there is an interest rate column where the percentage

42

00:02:48,600  -->  00:02:55,660
column which we haven't dealt with before but the treatment will be similar to the balance column.

43

00:02:55,680  -->  00:02:57,990
Similar but not exactly the same.

44

00:02:58,020  -->  00:02:59,380
So what are we going to do now.

45

00:02:59,430  -->  00:03:06,990
Well right away three things that you do fix updates fix up anything with a decimal point and basically

46

00:03:06,990  -->  00:03:14,810
commas dollars percentages and check for long winded comments that we might need to change back to a

47

00:03:14,810  -->  00:03:16,040
general type.

48

00:03:16,230  -->  00:03:17,140
So they don't get cut off.

49

00:03:17,130  -->  00:03:23,070
So looks like all the rolls are under or all of the columns are under 1000 symbols 1000 characters or

50

00:03:23,070  -->  00:03:29,910
even 250 characters because Excel cuts off at 250 if either a long or this column would have expanded

51

00:03:29,910  -->  00:03:30,040
.

52

00:03:30,060  -->  00:03:35,400
So that's fine we don't need to fix anything up then this question marks as you see here that's totally

53

00:03:35,400  -->  00:03:36,290
fine.

54

00:03:36,300  -->  00:03:42,330
So what I'm going to do actually I'm going to zoom in a little bit so we can see everything a bit better

55

00:03:42,330  -->  00:03:43,800
.

56

00:03:43,800  -->  00:03:44,680
All right.

57

00:03:44,820  -->  00:03:47,010
So that should be better.

58

00:03:47,340  -->  00:03:48,750
So where are these question marks.

59

00:03:48,750  -->  00:03:53,790
It just means that there was like an a foreign symbol there.

60

00:03:53,790  -->  00:03:55,320
We can't really do anything about that.

61

00:03:55,320  -->  00:03:58,110
It was like that already in the in the original data.

62

00:03:58,140  -->  00:04:04,320
We can go back and get the person who gave us that or to correct it but that's not going to be our focus

63

00:04:04,440  -->  00:04:06,200
in this.

64

00:04:06,470  -->  00:04:08,270
And this Tauriel or in this section.

65

00:04:08,310  -->  00:04:10,740
So let's fix up the dates.

66

00:04:10,740  -->  00:04:18,860
First of all we're going to go to data text to columns delimited no delimiter.

67

00:04:18,900  -->  00:04:27,730
Next date this one as you can see it's an American date so month day year finish.

68

00:04:27,750  -->  00:04:28,280
There we go.

69

00:04:28,290  -->  00:04:35,190
Dates fixed up and now right away we'll format cells and change them to the date that we want which

70

00:04:35,190  -->  00:04:39,000
is y y y m m d d.

71

00:04:39,360  -->  00:04:40,770
The canonical date.

72

00:04:40,980  -->  00:04:42,410
And there we go.

73

00:04:42,410  -->  00:04:47,200
So that's that comb's ready next column is the balance column.

74

00:04:47,240  -->  00:04:48,890
We really know what to do here.

75

00:04:48,930  -->  00:04:49,870
Same thing.

76

00:04:50,040  -->  00:04:51,780
Text two columns delimited.

77

00:04:51,810  -->  00:04:52,920
No delimiter.

78

00:04:52,950  -->  00:04:58,050
Next we need to change it to a general type.

79

00:04:58,050  -->  00:05:05,400
So basically just click through here and now we want to format cells and we want to change this to a

80

00:05:05,400  -->  00:05:09,550
number of faults any separators and two decimal points.

81

00:05:09,570  -->  00:05:10,200
Good.

82

00:05:10,590  -->  00:05:11,730
And then into straight.

83

00:05:11,730  -->  00:05:18,720
So this was going to be interesting as well we're going to takes two columns same thing same thing click

84

00:05:18,720  -->  00:05:26,030
through finish and now we want to change the interest rate format Seltsam we want to get rid of the

85

00:05:26,030  -->  00:05:34,260
percentage sign but that implies that we divide by 100 so we want like 0.1 to 4 here or a 0.1 6 6 here

86

00:05:34,280  -->  00:05:39,350
so let's see what happens when we select number decimal places we have to put 4 because we don't want

87

00:05:39,350  -->  00:05:41,750
to use any decimal places from here.

88

00:05:41,960  -->  00:05:47,030
And we click OK and that automatically fixes fixes it up for us.

89

00:05:47,030  -->  00:05:48,470
So that's good.

90

00:05:48,920  -->  00:05:55,670
Then we can just zoom through a file if we want to just just in case are not looking for anything specific

91

00:05:55,670  -->  00:05:56,700
.

92

00:05:56,790  -->  00:06:00,260
We've done oral all while fixing up so now we need to save the file.

93

00:06:00,260  -->  00:06:05,990
We won't press control s because we want to save it as a CSP file instead of a text file so I'll go

94

00:06:05,990  -->  00:06:09,190
save as and we don't want to touch that one.

95

00:06:09,230  -->  00:06:13,160
We want to create a new one which is going to be called fake names.

96

00:06:13,160  -->  00:06:15,080
Candidate C S B.

97

00:06:15,380  -->  00:06:16,580
OK.

98

00:06:17,290  -->  00:06:22,420
Yes and no we can close this.

99

00:06:22,580  -->  00:06:25,680
So let's have a look at that.

100

00:06:25,760  -->  00:06:30,800
So here you can see that tickety file this is his free file says he falls a little bit smaller here

101

00:06:31,400  -->  00:06:36,470
because that's how it works sometimes it can be much smaller depends on how many columns you have what

102

00:06:36,470  -->  00:06:37,930
types of data have in them.

103

00:06:37,940  -->  00:06:41,480
So let's open this one up with notepad plus plus and have a look.

104

00:06:41,510  -->  00:06:46,230
So here now we have all coma's looks really familiar to what we're used to working with.

105

00:06:46,280  -->  00:06:46,640
Great.

106

00:06:46,640  -->  00:06:53,860
So now we can go ahead and start uploading and this file actually it's a copy.

107

00:06:53,870  -->  00:06:56,390
It's basically a copy of the original file.

108

00:06:56,390  -->  00:07:00,680
We don't need it anymore because it's not prepared for it's not something we're going to be working

109

00:07:00,680  -->  00:07:00,970
with.

110

00:07:01,040  -->  00:07:09,110
We delete that then we take the we file we put it into uploaded data so today's date there is our CC

111

00:07:09,110  -->  00:07:12,670
file and now we're going to go kill server.

112

00:07:13,460  -->  00:07:17,780
So this management sorry we're going into my official studio.

113

00:07:17,930  -->  00:07:26,690
So we're going to open a project or not open we're going to a new project and we'll give it a name fake

114

00:07:26,930  -->  00:07:27,530
names.

115

00:07:27,530  -->  00:07:30,860
Canada integration services project.

116

00:07:30,860  -->  00:07:32,480
Perfect.

117

00:07:32,480  -->  00:07:33,870
Let's get this started.

118

00:07:34,160  -->  00:07:41,720
And so this data set is designed has been designed by me in a way that it doesn't have any errors in

119

00:07:41,720  -->  00:07:48,680
this upload phase just to save us some time however and we'll get to this later.

120

00:07:48,710  -->  00:07:53,600
Your homework will have errors in this face your homework.

121

00:07:53,600  -->  00:07:58,020
Trust me you don't want to do it.

122

00:07:58,100  -->  00:07:59,530
It is going to be hectic.

123

00:07:59,610  -->  00:08:02,360
So we'll get to that later.

124

00:08:02,360  -->  00:08:03,310
So browse.

125

00:08:03,350  -->  00:08:04,990
We want to find our file.

126

00:08:05,150  -->  00:08:07,730
Let's make sure it's a sci fi file open it up.

127

00:08:07,790  -->  00:08:09,330
You can copy the name here if you like.

128

00:08:09,380  -->  00:08:10,820
Doesn't really matter.

129

00:08:10,820  -->  00:08:13,940
Give it to Tick's qualifier column headers.

130

00:08:13,950  -->  00:08:15,660
That's good.

131

00:08:15,680  -->  00:08:16,910
Just look through.

132

00:08:16,910  -->  00:08:17,690
Look for an anomaly.

133

00:08:17,690  -->  00:08:24,140
It doesn't look like there's any anomalies although they are but not for this phase of the upload advanced

134

00:08:24,170  -->  00:08:25,280
as we're used to.

135

00:08:25,280  -->  00:08:30,080
Everything gets a thousand preview have a quick look.

136

00:08:30,620  -->  00:08:31,470
OK.

137

00:08:31,520  -->  00:08:32,510
Columns done.

138

00:08:32,540  -->  00:08:33,250
Error output.

139

00:08:33,300  -->  00:08:36,100
OK destination new.

140

00:08:36,350  -->  00:08:37,010
OK.

141

00:08:37,040  -->  00:08:41,000
New this create a file or I mean a table

142

00:08:43,610  -->  00:08:48,830
rule will call it's fake.

143

00:08:48,890  -->  00:08:54,580
So trophic name is canned.

144

00:08:54,640  -->  00:08:57,310
All right so that's done we click OK.

145

00:08:57,540  -->  00:08:59,780
OK the fall the table be created.

146

00:08:59,810  -->  00:09:00,890
Everything looks good.

147

00:09:00,980  -->  00:09:01,810
Mappings.

148

00:09:01,850  -->  00:09:02,450
OK.

149

00:09:02,510  -->  00:09:03,100
Output.

150

00:09:03,290  -->  00:09:06,490
So we won't have any.

151

00:09:06,820  -->  00:09:12,100
And any splits conditional splits because right now we're not focusing on that.

152

00:09:12,110  -->  00:09:16,130
Although in your homework you will be required to do some conditional splits.

153

00:09:16,430  -->  00:09:17,150
So we're ready.

154

00:09:17,180  -->  00:09:19,420
Let's launch this and see how we go.

155

00:09:19,940  -->  00:09:22,640
Okay so off it goes.

156

00:09:22,900  -->  00:09:26,780
There's 200000 rows so we'll just skip to that and right away.

157

00:09:26,780  -->  00:09:30,460
In this video.

158

00:09:30,770  -->  00:09:31,120
All right.

159

00:09:31,130  -->  00:09:36,830
So the upload has been completed and now we can go check our table.

160

00:09:36,830  -->  00:09:39,170
So we'll just quickly finish this.

161

00:09:39,590  -->  00:09:44,740
And as we remember we disable and now we just save.

162

00:09:44,750  -->  00:09:45,290
All right.

163

00:09:45,320  -->  00:09:56,200
So how about now we go open up as or a management studio and have a look at our table connect databases

164

00:09:56,690  -->  00:09:59,240
DSTraining tables.

165

00:10:00,090  -->  00:10:00,810
Where is it.

166

00:10:00,820  -->  00:10:05,350
Fake names can select the rows.

167

00:10:05,480  -->  00:10:06,260
All right.

168

00:10:06,260  -->  00:10:06,830
Perfect.

169

00:10:06,830  -->  00:10:09,530
So there it is.

170

00:10:09,530  -->  00:10:12,710
That's top thousand if we select everything.

171

00:10:13,060  -->  00:10:14,630
It will be much greater.

172

00:10:14,630  -->  00:10:23,210
So here you can see that whoops we do have 200000 rows and they have been actually uploaded an order

173

00:10:23,210  -->  00:10:26,080
which is great and everything looks fantastic.

174

00:10:26,080  -->  00:10:31,590
So this is us finished of e-tail faces one into Wasn't that very quick.

175

00:10:31,610  -->  00:10:35,980
It took less less than 10 minutes and total around 10 minutes.

176

00:10:36,220  -->  00:10:38,030
You can get much faster at it.

177

00:10:38,270  -->  00:10:44,540
But anyway they are still anomalies in the data which we haven't picked out yet and it's quite impossible

178

00:10:44,540  -->  00:10:52,580
to pick them out manually so starting from the next Tauriel we going to find or we're going to define

179

00:10:52,580  -->  00:10:59,920
a blueprint how to surgically remove anomalies that can affect your analysis.

180

00:10:59,930  -->  00:11:01,820
I look forward to seeing you next time
