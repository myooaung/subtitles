00:00:00.690  -->  00:00:06.230
Last time we looked at transforming variables and we ended up with this low balance variable which we

2

00:00:06.230  -->  00:00:10.210
are now using in our regression instead of the balance variable.

3

00:00:10.230  -->  00:00:12.010
So I'm just going to put this to the side.

4

00:00:12.420  -->  00:00:17.670
And what we're going to talk about today is creating derived variables.

5

00:00:17.700  -->  00:00:23.940
The concept is very similar to transforming variables but the nature is a bit different.

6

00:00:23.940  -->  00:00:29.700
What we're doing which is for a Marable's is we had an effect but we thought it was misrepresented by

7

00:00:29.700  -->  00:00:37.260
the variable we wanted to contrast it and maybe represent a more significantly less significant by transforming

8

00:00:37.290  -->  00:00:39.130
transforming that specific variable.

9

00:00:39.360  -->  00:00:44.940
Whereas when we creating derived variables were creating a representation for new effects that are currently

10

00:00:45.270  -->  00:00:47.770
not illustrated by our data.

11

00:00:47.850  -->  00:00:49.950
And let me explain through an example.

12

00:00:50.370  -->  00:00:58.920
So here we've got a column which is balance and the colon which is age and it is normal for balance

13

00:00:58.920  -->  00:01:00.590
to grow with age it doesn't always happen.

14

00:01:00.600  -->  00:01:06.330
But generally the older a person gets the more balance they will have on their account because they

15

00:01:06.330  -->  00:01:09.060
accumulate wealth over time.

16

00:01:09.060  -->  00:01:15.090
However there's also different effects where different people accumulate wealth wealth differently and

17

00:01:15.360  -->  00:01:22.530
somebody who is in their late fifties might have a great balance but somebody who is in their early

18

00:01:22.530  -->  00:01:28.170
30s might have a very similar to that person balance even though they're younger just because they're

19

00:01:28.170  -->  00:01:30.890
more successful at work they're more ambitious.

20

00:01:31.020  -->  00:01:32.850
They may be saved better.

21

00:01:32.850  -->  00:01:38.730
They have different financial strategies or goals and because we're mixing everything up together and

22

00:01:38.730  -->  00:01:46.110
we're only looking at balance those two people get mixed up and in a way they'll be regarded in a similar

23

00:01:46.110  -->  00:01:47.190
fashion.

24

00:01:47.190  -->  00:01:52.950
But what if we want to take those separate those effect so we want to separate people who accumulate

25

00:01:53.070  -->  00:02:00.690
balance over time naturally from people who are actually determined to save up a balance or to grow

26

00:02:00.690  -->  00:02:03.560
their balance and therefore they are able to do it at an early age.

27

00:02:03.660  -->  00:02:11.340
And also we might want to separate people who are the opposite who are old but have a low balance and

28

00:02:11.490  -->  00:02:18.240
maybe they're at risk of defaulting or maybe they are banking of somebody else.

29

00:02:18.230  -->  00:02:23.700
And so there's lots of different effects in that that are just getting masked by the fact that we're

30

00:02:23.730  -->  00:02:26.270
treating everybody just based on the ballots.

31

00:02:26.280  -->  00:02:34.800
So in this way in this sense is a very popular method to create a variable which represents the speed

32

00:02:34.800  -->  00:02:40.260
at which people are accumulating wealth and that is by taking balance and dividing it by age.

33

00:02:40.260  -->  00:02:43.280
So that's exactly what we're going to do now.

34

00:02:43.350  -->  00:02:45.960
We're going to Right-Click undefined variable.

35

00:02:46.050  -->  00:02:54.400
And I will call it wealth accumulation and all just think balance and divided by age.

36

00:02:54.570  -->  00:02:55.700
That's as simple as that.

37

00:02:55.710  -->  00:02:58.870
Because we know that age is not a zero ever.

38

00:02:59.280  -->  00:03:04.380
And there we go that's our new wealth accumulation variable over here.

39

00:03:04.380  -->  00:03:09.840
So what we can do now is we just can include it in our regression.

40

00:03:09.840  -->  00:03:16.740
We'll go to model logit binary and find a new variable and then just put it into our regression and

41

00:03:16.740  -->  00:03:17.750
we click OK.

42

00:03:18.270  -->  00:03:22.060
And those compared to what we already had.

43

00:03:23.880  -->  00:03:25.430
So what happened here.

44

00:03:25.770  -->  00:03:32.160
Well first thing we can see is that there is a variable and it's actually got a negative sign but doesn't

45

00:03:32.160  -->  00:03:35.760
really matter what side it has because it is not significant.

46

00:03:35.760  -->  00:03:42.210
And another thing you'll notice is that the R squared what happens are you actually decreased a little

47

00:03:42.210  -->  00:03:49.230
bit and our accuracy decreased a little bit so adding this variable is not a good thing for this specific

48

00:03:49.230  -->  00:03:50.220
model.

49

00:03:50.220  -->  00:03:57.760
However what we're not taking into consideration right now is the fact that there might be some quarterly

50

00:03:57.830  -->  00:04:06.840
collinearity effects because wealth accumulation look includes balance which is in load balance and

51

00:04:06.900  -->  00:04:07.590
age.

52

00:04:07.770  -->  00:04:16.740
So basically what that means is that this variable might be somehow or these three variables are correlated

53

00:04:16.770  -->  00:04:24.120
and by including them in the model maybe we are actually causing damage to the model and therefore one

54

00:04:24.120  -->  00:04:25.720
of them has to be excluded.

55

00:04:25.740  -->  00:04:31.590
So effects like the out of multi-collinearity We will talk about in the next tutorial when we're checking

56

00:04:31.590  -->  00:04:35.690
for multi-color Lunardi using the method.

57

00:04:36.180  -->  00:04:42.150
But for now what I wanted to say is that sometimes you might want to include a variable like that balance

58

00:04:42.150  -->  00:04:47.300
over age and you might have other ideas for creating new variables.

59

00:04:47.310  -->  00:04:54.210
You could take 10 year and divide that by age or understand you know the difference between some variables

60

00:04:54.210  -->  00:04:54.400
.

61

00:04:54.510  -->  00:05:00.630
You could even create a variable which is like a flag like whether a person has a zero balance or doesn't

62

00:05:00.630  -->  00:05:06.930
have a zero balance so you might want to try that that might work well in this data set different types

63

00:05:06.930  -->  00:05:08.590
of verbal So anything that comes to mind.

64

00:05:08.600  -->  00:05:14.180
And also like I said with transformations there's a lot of business knowledge involved here.

65

00:05:14.220  -->  00:05:19.200
It's actually in derived variables it might be a bit easier than transformations because you don't have

66

00:05:19.200  -->  00:05:23.370
to know whether it's a square or a variable or take a logarithm or square root out of it.

67

00:05:23.490  -->  00:05:30.780
But you can somehow assess effects may be for instance if you're doing some modeling for a manufacturing

68

00:05:30.780  -->  00:05:33.470
plant you might know that it's not.

69

00:05:33.510  -->  00:05:40.410
It's not about how much oil you put into the machines but it's how much oil per square meter of something

70

00:05:40.410  -->  00:05:43.400
that you put into machines and you might know that you need to actually.

71

00:05:43.530  -->  00:05:47.870
These metrics are used by the engineers so why don't I put it into my regression and things like that

72

00:05:47.880  -->  00:05:54.440
so your domain knowledge will help you identify these drive variables that change your grade.

73

00:05:54.450  -->  00:05:56.330
So I just gave you an example here.

74

00:05:56.790  -->  00:05:57.730
That's how you do it.

75

00:05:57.750  -->  00:06:03.540
And then you just include in your model and in the next tutorial we will have a look and see how you

76

00:06:03.540  -->  00:06:08.180
can also check for multicollinearity effects to make sure you're not breaking a model
