00:00:00,230  -->  00:00:00,830
S..

2

00:00:00,840  -->  00:00:01,740
Recap.

3

00:00:01,770  -->  00:00:05,670
So what did we learn in the section about model maintenance.

4

00:00:05,670  -->  00:00:11,370
First of all we saw what model generation is and what model is duration actually looks like.

5

00:00:11,430  -->  00:00:18,330
And I think that that was very important for you to see how that will look in real life so that you

6

00:00:18,330  -->  00:00:22,070
can easily detect a situation when it occurs.

7

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:28,110
And I think we really drove the point home with those interesting visuals that we had in that tutorial

8

00:00:28,110  -->  00:00:28,910
.

9

00:00:28,940  -->  00:00:31,370
There were two white models DCR 8.

10

00:00:31,500  -->  00:00:34,000
So we looked at why they deteriorated over time.

11

00:00:34,000  -->  00:00:35,470
That spontaneous iteration.

12

00:00:35,550  -->  00:00:41,310
So although there is no blueprint here there can be myriads of reasons why models deteriorate we still

13

00:00:41,310  -->  00:00:47,850
throw around some ideas that will help you understand why a model is iterating if you do come across

14

00:00:47,850  -->  00:00:48,810
a situation.

15

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:55,880
Then we talked about the three levels of Bonnell maintenance or the H R R process assess retrain rebuild

16

00:00:55,880  -->  00:00:56,240
.

17

00:00:56,370  -->  00:00:57,690
Its not a complicated process.

18

00:00:57,690  -->  00:01:04,050
All you have to do is make sure that you assess your models quite frequently at least once every six

19

00:01:04,050  -->  00:01:10,670
months maybe a bit more frequently in some industries and for some types of models.

20

00:01:11,160  -->  00:01:14,550
And then we talked about the Champion challenge or set up.

21

00:01:14,550  -->  00:01:20,490
So if you do decide to build a new model and your old model is not performing too poorly then you might

22

00:01:20,490  -->  00:01:26,070
want to run them side by side to see if the new model is actually performing better than the old model

23

00:01:26,160  -->  00:01:28,300
in real life situations.

24

00:01:28,620  -->  00:01:31,710
And that brings us to the end of this section.

25

00:01:31,710  -->  00:01:36,450
I hope you enjoyed it picked up a lot of useful information and I look forward See you in the next one

26

00:01:36,450  -->  00:01:36,590
.

27

00:01:36,630  -->  00:01:38,280
Until then happy analyzing
