1

00:00:01,080  -->  00:00:02,350
The truth isn't always pretty.

2

00:00:02,520  -->  00:00:04,110
And I'd like to solve this sort of a question.

3

00:00:04,110  -->  00:00:10,440
So when I told students of course that I'm going to have this tutorial in the course of one of them

4

00:00:10,440  -->  00:00:12,760
said yes that's exactly what I want.

5

00:00:12,780  -->  00:00:17,820
How do you deal with that well the fact that the truth isn't always pretty when the client wants to

6

00:00:17,820  -->  00:00:18,470
challenge you.

7

00:00:18,630  -->  00:00:23,730
How do you keep from alienating the client when your results aren't giving them what they were hoping

8

00:00:23,730  -->  00:00:24,290
for.

9

00:00:24,420  -->  00:00:27,390
What always do you avoid this minefield.

10

00:00:27,390  -->  00:00:28,750
How do you get back.

11

00:00:28,770  -->  00:00:31,280
How do you go back to your team and say does it go well.

12

00:00:31,280  -->  00:00:34,060
But I have some new ideas for looking like the film.

13

00:00:34,380  -->  00:00:36,000
So this is true.

14

00:00:36,000  -->  00:00:41,820
The truth is not always pretty Darren My neck is like insulting but it's from the bottom up.

15

00:00:41,820  -->  00:00:47,970
So consulting is a top down kind of approach where you come up with strategy and trickle down from executives

16

00:00:47,970  -->  00:00:51,290
to managers to the execution level and the whole business.

17

00:00:51,390  -->  00:00:55,010
Whereas Dolemite or does science is the opposite.

18

00:00:55,080  -->  00:00:58,640
You start from the bottom by dynamiting to looking for her daughter.

19

00:00:58,830  -->  00:01:03,270
Then you go up up up through the levels and you take it all the way to the executives.

20

00:01:03,270  -->  00:01:11,220
So in Dallasites you simply are looking at the facts the hard facts and if something happens if something

21

00:01:11,220  -->  00:01:15,030
is there you can say it's not that like if there was a bottleneck there is a bottleneck if there is

22

00:01:15,060  -->  00:01:18,180
an inefficiency in the part and there's an inefficient in the department.

23

00:01:18,330  -->  00:01:20,210
You can't avoid the truth.

24

00:01:20,220  -->  00:01:25,680
And sometimes the things that you find and present will not resonate with the people that you're presenting

25

00:01:25,680  -->  00:01:25,960
to.

26

00:01:25,980  -->  00:01:29,510
They both like these things and that is normal.

27

00:01:29,520  -->  00:01:30,480
Be prepared for that.

28

00:01:30,480  -->  00:01:34,830
That happens happens a lot and you've got to prepare yourself for that.

29

00:01:34,830  -->  00:01:37,340
But more importantly and this is my answer to this question.

30

00:01:37,620  -->  00:01:38,790
You've got to prepare your audience.

31

00:01:38,790  -->  00:01:43,530
So the people that asked you to do this product are the people you're going to be presenting in the

32

00:01:43,550  -->  00:01:49,860
end of the day where you are starting this project you've got to make it clear that you don't know what

33

00:01:49,860  -->  00:01:51,150
the outcome is going to be you.

34

00:01:51,230  -->  00:01:54,990
You will look for solutions for insights and so on.

35

00:01:54,990  -->  00:01:57,480
But those insights they might not like.

36

00:01:57,480  -->  00:02:03,390
And so the best way to go about it is just tell them at the start that the insights that I find might

37

00:02:03,450  -->  00:02:08,100
not you might not be comfortable with and what and then discuss it with them like what do you think

38

00:02:08,160  -->  00:02:14,130
we should do if this happens like what are your what is your plan of attack and so on what would you

39

00:02:14,130  -->  00:02:15,140
like to do.

40

00:02:15,150  -->  00:02:15,640
Would you like it.

41

00:02:15,640  -->  00:02:17,310
You know what if this happens.

42

00:02:17,400  -->  00:02:24,120
So put it in their head right away that you're mining for facts and those facts might not be pretty

43

00:02:24,120  -->  00:02:24,510
.

44

00:02:24,510  -->  00:02:26,970
And that's it that's that's how you go about it.

45

00:02:26,970  -->  00:02:31,220
And when the time comes you present and you've got to be prepared for it.

46

00:02:31,230  -->  00:02:37,000
And just just remember that's not everything is always going to be pretty what you've got to find your

47

00:02:37,090  -->  00:02:39,900
to find out what happened what's happening.

48

00:02:39,910  -->  00:02:44,990
And you know hopefully you will come up with solutions to the problems that you did.
