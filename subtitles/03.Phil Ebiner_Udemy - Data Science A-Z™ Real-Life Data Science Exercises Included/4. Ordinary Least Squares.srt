00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:06,120
Ordinary least squares in the previous tutorial talked about the linear regression being a trend line

2

00:00:06,240  -->  00:00:07,560
that best fits your data.

3

00:00:07,620  -->  00:00:13,320
Today we'll find out how to find the best fitting like or in fact how simple the new regression finds

4

00:00:13,320  -->  00:00:14,530
that line for you.

5

00:00:14,790  -->  00:00:19,990
So here's our simple in your aggression the same chart salary versus experience.

6

00:00:20,040  -->  00:00:27,120
We've got these red dots which represent the actual observations that we have in our data and we've

7

00:00:27,120  -->  00:00:34,830
got the trend line which represents the best fitting line or the simple linear regression model.

8

00:00:34,830  -->  00:00:40,860
So now let's draw some vertical lines from the actual observations to the model.

9

00:00:41,010  -->  00:00:45,650
And let's look at one of the specific examples to understand what we're talking about here.

10

00:00:45,990  -->  00:00:55,020
So here you can see that the Red Cross is where that person is sitting at in terms of salary so let's

11

00:00:55,020  -->  00:00:58,980
say this person with five 10 years of experience is earning $100000.

12

00:00:59,130  -->  00:01:01,370
Well the model line.

13

00:01:01,410  -->  00:01:07,690
So the blackline at the bottom it actually tells us where that person should be sitting according to

14

00:01:07,690  -->  00:01:09,130
the model in terms of salary.

15

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:15,870
And according to our model should be a bit lower it should be somewhere where that Green Cross is which

16

00:01:15,870  -->  00:01:19,220
is about maybe let's say $8000.

17

00:01:19,890  -->  00:01:24,630
So now the Red Cross is called Why are you so why if the subscript.

18

00:01:24,930  -->  00:01:32,950
And that is the actual duration the Green Cross is called Why I hat and that is the modeled observational

19

00:01:33,030  -->  00:01:33,160
.

20

00:01:33,190  -->  00:01:39,090
The modeled value So basically with those that level of experience where would he be.

21

00:01:39,150  -->  00:01:41,110
Where does the model predict that earning.

22

00:01:41,160  -->  00:01:45,480
And so the green line therefore is the difference between what he's actually earning and what he should

23

00:01:45,480  -->  00:01:45,900
be earning.

24

00:01:45,900  -->  00:01:49,610
So on what should be what he's modeled to be earning.

25

00:01:49,680  -->  00:01:56,820
So therefore the green line will be the same regardless of what dependent variable you have whether

26

00:01:56,820  -->  00:01:59,260
it's salary whether it's grade school whatever.

27

00:01:59,370  -->  00:02:06,140
So it's the difference between the observed and the modeled for that level of independent variable.

28

00:02:06,150  -->  00:02:13,920
Now to get this best fit in line what is done is you take the sum you take each one of those green lines

29

00:02:13,920  -->  00:02:19,350
are those distances you square them and then you take some of those squares.

30

00:02:19,350  -->  00:02:23,590
Once you have the sum of the squares for you got to find the minimum.

31

00:02:23,610  -->  00:02:29,880
So basically what a simple linear regression does is it draws lots and lots and lots of these lines

32

00:02:29,890  -->  00:02:30,060
.

33

00:02:30,270  -->  00:02:36,210
These trend lines all this is like a simplistic way of imagining the linear regression draws all these

34

00:02:36,870  -->  00:02:44,320
all possible trendlines 3.0 and counts the sum of those squares every single time.

35

00:02:44,330  -->  00:02:50,030
And its recall records are somewhere in a temporary you know for file or something like that.

36

00:02:50,040  -->  00:02:55,710
And then it finds the minimum one so it looks for the minimum sum of squares and finds a line which

37

00:02:55,710  -->  00:02:59,040
has the smallest sum of squares possible.

38

00:02:59,460  -->  00:03:05,370
And that line will be the best fitting line and that is called the ordinary least squares method.

39

00:03:05,610  -->  00:03:10,930
So that's how the simple linear regression works out for you on the next tutorial.
