00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:01,320
S..

2

00:00:01,320  -->  00:00:02,090
Recap.

3

00:00:02,100  -->  00:00:07,470
So what did we learn in this rather intense section and this section learnt.

4

00:00:07,530  -->  00:00:14,490
Our number one ranking dimension so we saw how our model has provided a new dimension which we can use

5

00:00:14,490  -->  00:00:22,890
to look at our customers that dimension is their ranking in the model their probability to leave the

6

00:00:22,890  -->  00:00:25,110
bank or us an action.

7

00:00:25,260  -->  00:00:32,220
And that allows us to drive additional insights or see customers create deciles Corel's and so on to

8

00:00:32,280  -->  00:00:35,500
better service our customers.

9

00:00:36,000  -->  00:00:42,990
Number two how to draw insights from the cumulative accuracy profile and specifically we looked at two

10

00:00:42,990  -->  00:00:44,000
types of insights.

11

00:00:44,010  -->  00:00:48,630
Number one if you have a budget constraint What do you do how do you find out the people you contact

12

00:00:48,870  -->  00:00:55,390
and how do you talk to the manager of the department that's contacting these people.

13

00:00:55,500  -->  00:01:01,610
How can you say exactly what's the return on investment will be for that budget.

14

00:01:01,710  -->  00:01:09,060
And two is efficiency so sometimes you don't actually need to contact everybody to get a good and efficient

15

00:01:09,180  -->  00:01:10,460
outcome.

16

00:01:10,500  -->  00:01:16,470
So basically you can save a lot of money or maybe focus on other things and deliver a better customer

17

00:01:16,470  -->  00:01:21,370
experience because you're not bothering people with too much e-mails or contacts.

18

00:01:21,390  -->  00:01:28,410
And by the way just to clarify we are talking in terms of customers and a customer and American Grafix

19

00:01:28,460  -->  00:01:28,970
condition.

20

00:01:29,070  -->  00:01:35,280
But as I mentioned a couple times throughout this part of the course all of these principles are also

21

00:01:35,280  -->  00:01:42,420
applicable in other industries where there is a factory that addition to the brushes or it's a fraud

22

00:01:42,420  -->  00:01:44,430
investigation engagement anything.

23

00:01:44,460  -->  00:01:52,290
So just basically replace your independent depende verbals with the correct observations that you are

24

00:01:52,290  -->  00:01:52,890
interested in.

25

00:01:52,890  -->  00:02:01,820
All correct effects that you're looking for and you'll get to basically the same result their numbers

26

00:02:01,830  -->  00:02:02,490
after all right.

27

00:02:02,490  -->  00:02:08,400
So it doesn't matter what form they take it matters how we deal with them and what insights we're able

28

00:02:08,400  -->  00:02:08,950
to produce.

29

00:02:09,060  -->  00:02:12,330
So just keep that in mind that it doesn't have to be a cosmic joke.

30

00:02:12,390  -->  00:02:17,280
Joe demographic segmentation model and number three odds ratio.

31

00:02:17,330  -->  00:02:20,710
So this was one of the advanced topics this is where they started.

32

00:02:20,730  -->  00:02:24,870
We talked about the odds ratio and how it links to probability.

33

00:02:24,900  -->  00:02:29,910
Then we talked about how you can actually interpret the coefficients of logistic regression.

34

00:02:30,240  -->  00:02:35,610
It's not as direct and straightforward as in a multiple their regression that's why these topics were

35

00:02:35,610  -->  00:02:37,890
it was because we had to go into a bit of math.

36

00:02:38,040  -->  00:02:45,600
But we did find out how a 1 unit increase and in an independent variable over logistic regression actually

37

00:02:45,600  -->  00:02:55,860
translates into a change of the odds ratio for the probability of the event occurring.

38

00:02:56,130  -->  00:02:58,500
And Number 5 we looked at the practical application.

39

00:02:58,500  -->  00:03:05,520
So I give you an example of how I would go about presenting my findings in a logistic regression to

40

00:03:05,820  -->  00:03:13,080
a manager or to an executive of the company and how to really visually portray your findings using a

41

00:03:13,080  -->  00:03:13,830
heat map.

42

00:03:14,160  -->  00:03:16,110
So that's all for this section.

43

00:03:16,110  -->  00:03:16,890
Hope you enjoyed it.

44

00:03:16,890  -->  00:03:21,370
Hope you had fun and learned some valuable knowledge here.

45

00:03:21,510  -->  00:03:23,880
And I look forward to see you in the next section of the Course.

46

00:03:23,940  -->  00:03:25,630
Until then happy analyzing
