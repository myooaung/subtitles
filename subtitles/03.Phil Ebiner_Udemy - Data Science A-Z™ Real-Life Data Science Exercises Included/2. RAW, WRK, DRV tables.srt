1

00:00:00,700  -->  00:00:05,340
Know that we're in phase three of the tail process which is the final phase I thought it would be a

2

00:00:05,340  -->  00:00:10,460
good idea to take a step back and look at the e-tail process as a whole at all of the three phases I

3

00:00:10,460  -->  00:00:11,870
understand how they work together.

4

00:00:12,090  -->  00:00:18,090
And then in the same tutorial we will also look in a bit more detail at what we will be learning in

5

00:00:18,090  -->  00:00:22,300
phase 3 What exactly will be and hence the name for this tutorial.

6

00:00:22,350  -->  00:00:24,270
We're all work GRV.

7

00:00:24,450  -->  00:00:26,420
So let's get straight into it.

8

00:00:26,640  -->  00:00:29,980
In our e-mail process in phase 1.

9

00:00:30,270  -->  00:00:36,120
This was before Sosias we did some cleaning so we took the original data we put into the prepared folder

10

00:00:36,120  -->  00:00:36,390
.

11

00:00:36,390  -->  00:00:43,770
We looked at it using specific methods like opening text files in Excel to understand the formats of

12

00:00:43,770  -->  00:00:53,130
the data and to format dates and dollars and other Scovel columns correctly so that when we pulled the

13

00:00:53,130  -->  00:01:01,290
data we have less headache and then we put that file into the uploaded folder in e-tail Phase 2.

14

00:01:01,380  -->  00:01:06,970
The goal was to get the file from the uploaded folder into the wrong table in our database.

15

00:01:07,080  -->  00:01:09,060
And this was all done in SOSIAS.

16

00:01:09,210  -->  00:01:15,090
And also as an intermediate step we had conditional splits sometimes you might need those to filter

17

00:01:15,090  -->  00:01:20,460
certain roles out of your data which you cannot analyze because it corruptor there's insufficient data

18

00:01:20,460  -->  00:01:20,700
.

19

00:01:20,700  -->  00:01:27,980
So this part was only focusing on getting the file or the data from the file into the database.

20

00:01:27,990  -->  00:01:30,240
And that was e-tail face too.

21

00:01:30,480  -->  00:01:34,050
And finally in this section we're talking about e-tail face three.

22

00:01:34,110  -->  00:01:41,430
And here we will be dealing will start with 4.0 in the row format then we will move it into the work

23

00:01:41,550  -->  00:01:47,120
into a working table then we will move it into a derived table and all of this will be done in escrow

24

00:01:47,230  -->  00:01:47,430
.

25

00:01:47,610  -->  00:01:54,030
So we've already talked about a lot of retail and done a lot of practice with retail Phase 1 and Phase

26

00:01:54,030  -->  00:01:54,380
2.

27

00:01:54,490  -->  00:01:59,670
Let's talk a bit more detail about e-tail Phase 3 right now so that we're a bit more comfortable with

28

00:01:59,670  -->  00:02:03,140
what's going on in this whole section of the course.

29

00:02:03,240  -->  00:02:08,720
So in e-tail Phase 3 we start with the daughter in our rule table.

30

00:02:08,910  -->  00:02:14,700
Next we want to move the door into a working table why it will because the road table it's all formatted

31

00:02:14,700  -->  00:02:22,830
as Text and we want it's formatted properly so we want numbers with decimal points to be formatted as

32

00:02:22,830  -->  00:02:28,620
floats numbers for decimal points or whole numbers on the formatters integers to go on dates formatted

33

00:02:28,620  -->  00:02:34,440
as states not as text and so on so that our analytical tools can work with these values correctly with

34

00:02:34,470  -->  00:02:41,370
all of our fields correctly and in order to do this transition from war or to work we have to engage

35

00:02:41,370  -->  00:02:44,650
in a process which I call build and in short BLT.

36

00:02:44,790  -->  00:02:50,220
And basically we're building a new working table from scratch in our database and then we're populating

37

00:02:50,220  -->  00:02:53,070
it with data coming from our raw table.

38

00:02:53,280  -->  00:02:59,070
And in order to facilitate this process we're going to use something which is called a stored procedure

39

00:02:59,070  -->  00:02:59,400
.

40

00:02:59,400  -->  00:03:03,060
We'll talk more about store procedures in the coming to Charles in this section.

41

00:03:03,210  -->  00:03:09,330
But basically a stored procedure is a script in a skill which you can save.

42

00:03:09,330  -->  00:03:15,660
So whatever you write in that sort of procedure that's the way we'll be looking at it is it's like a

43

00:03:15,750  -->  00:03:21,620
encapsulation for code which you can execute and create the new working table.

44

00:03:21,630  -->  00:03:26,790
But also if you exit it in a different way you can actually save your code and we'll talk more about

45

00:03:26,790  -->  00:03:28,210
that in the coming.

46

00:03:28,230  -->  00:03:33,210
But just conceptually this is how it works to get from a raw table to working table.

47

00:03:33,210  -->  00:03:39,780
You have to have this procedure which will which will code and which will build your working table for

48

00:03:39,780  -->  00:03:41,230
you and populated with the dog.

49

00:03:41,460  -->  00:03:47,820
And here I'd like to highlight that this is practically the end of the e-tail process so once you have

50

00:03:47,820  -->  00:03:50,130
the working table you're pretty much done.

51

00:03:50,160  -->  00:03:58,770
You can connect different analytical tools like Tablo or Python and other tools to your working table

52

00:03:59,070  -->  00:04:05,520
and extract the data and perform all of the manipulations that you need do the visualisations run the

53

00:04:05,520  -->  00:04:06,900
models and so on.

54

00:04:07,110  -->  00:04:10,300
So that is where our e-tail phase ends.

55

00:04:10,320  -->  00:04:15,490
However you can take it a step further and I'll show you this in the course as well.

56

00:04:15,660  -->  00:04:22,780
You can take it to a GRV table GRV tables a derived table so basically once you're working tables are

57

00:04:22,790  -->  00:04:25,600
ready you might want to combine them in certain ways.

58

00:04:25,720  -->  00:04:31,740
And although you can do that in your analytical tools and Tablo and on and so on it might be a bit easier

59

00:04:31,740  -->  00:04:37,440
to do it as well because that is one of the biggest advantages of a skill that it is very good at Daughter

60

00:04:37,440  -->  00:04:41,880
manipulation and allows you to combine tables very well that's what it is designed for.

61

00:04:41,880  -->  00:04:43,120
So it's a storage facility.

62

00:04:43,200  -->  00:04:48,820
And also it allows you to manipulate data very very easily got all the functionality for that.

63

00:04:48,960  -->  00:04:54,780
So if you do decide to go upon embark upon this journey and create some derived tables were you combining

64

00:04:54,780  -->  00:05:01,630
tables or do some aggregations on your tables then you also need a building process.

65

00:05:01,650  -->  00:05:04,440
Once again this is just terminology that I use.

66

00:05:04,440  -->  00:05:07,190
It's not it's not a native Asgill terminology.

67

00:05:07,230  -->  00:05:09,660
And for this we will have a different proc.

68

00:05:09,660  -->  00:05:17,280
So a procedure to and so procedure one proceeded to here related to your specific table the table that

69

00:05:17,280  -->  00:05:18,890
you started with in raw.

70

00:05:19,200  -->  00:05:23,160
If you have multiple tables and each one of them will go through this process.

71

00:05:23,310  -->  00:05:29,910
And once again that is as long as you want to get to the GRV stage in in reality your e-tail and to

72

00:05:29,910  -->  00:05:35,160
the left of this vertical line so once you have your working table you're done with your e-tail process

73

00:05:35,490  -->  00:05:36,940
and from there you can do analytics.

74

00:05:37,110  -->  00:05:38,730
However it is convenient.

75

00:05:38,790  -->  00:05:45,360
While we are in a skill to sometimes connect the tables and move on to a GRV table so that it might

76

00:05:45,360  -->  00:05:49,820
be a bit easier for analytical tools to handle it later on down the track.

77

00:05:49,890  -->  00:05:53,890
And I will also show you how to do that in this section on the course.
