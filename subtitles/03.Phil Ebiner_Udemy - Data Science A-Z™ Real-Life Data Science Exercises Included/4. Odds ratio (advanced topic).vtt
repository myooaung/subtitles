00:00:00.720  -->  00:00:07.080
Odds ratio we hear about quite a lot when it comes to sports whether it's betting on horses or on soccer

2

00:00:07.080  -->  00:00:13.650
matches or even gambling and I bet you've heard phrases like the odds are ten to one or the odds of

3

00:00:13.650  -->  00:00:21.030
75 or the odds are three to two in favor of this and that and et cetera et cetera et cetera.

4

00:00:21.390  -->  00:00:23.580
And today we will talk about odds.

5

00:00:23.580  -->  00:00:30.090
We will try to understand what exactly ords is but more importantly we need to understand how is probability

6

00:00:30.150  -->  00:00:38.040
linked to odds because we will be working with these terms quite a lot in the coming tutorials in this

7

00:00:38.100  -->  00:00:39.870
section.

8

00:00:39.870  -->  00:00:45.420
Here are the odds for the Melbourne Cup the Melbourne Cup is a horse race which runs in Australia in

9

00:00:45.570  -->  00:00:47.150
November every year.

10

00:00:47.410  -->  00:00:51.470
And and what we're looking at here are the dollar.

11

00:00:51.660  -->  00:00:56.390
And I'll just like to say here right away that I'm not advocating gambling or anything.

12

00:00:56.790  -->  00:01:03.070
This is just a great example for us to do our calculations off and nothing more than that here.

13

00:01:03.090  -->  00:01:08.370
We've got dollar odds and as you can see they're increasing for these 10 horses as you go down the list

14

00:01:08.370  -->  00:01:08.610
.

15

00:01:08.610  -->  00:01:09.830
So what do they mean.

16

00:01:10.110  -->  00:01:14.850
Well basically it's telling you how much money you will get if that specific horse wins.

17

00:01:14.850  -->  00:01:20.520
So as you can see the horse at the top will bring you the least money because it is deemed to be the

18

00:01:20.520  -->  00:01:24.990
most favorable horse the most likely to win the race the horse to the bottom will give you the most

19

00:01:24.990  -->  00:01:30.800
money because it is deemed to be the least feral horse out of these 10.

20

00:01:30.810  -->  00:01:33.730
Now we want to move onto a different type of odds.

21

00:01:33.750  -->  00:01:37.600
We want to talk about losing to winning odds rather than dollars.

22

00:01:37.590  -->  00:01:40.250
So how do we convert dollars into losing to winning.

23

00:01:40.470  -->  00:01:46.080
Well first of all you have to split the dollars into two parts here.

24

00:01:46.150  -->  00:01:51.660
What's the dollar odds of telling you is that if you put $1 on this horse which is called Fame game

25

00:01:51.660  -->  00:01:58.190
the first one in the list then if that horse comes first you will get back $11.

26

00:01:58.200  -->  00:02:01.340
However those 11 dollars already include your $1.

27

00:02:01.470  -->  00:02:04.320
So basically you're going to win only $10.

28

00:02:04.320  -->  00:02:10.200
So let's just quickly recap on that if the horse doesn't come first you won't get your $1 back you will

29

00:02:10.200  -->  00:02:15.960
lose your $1 or a random person who's betting on this horse will lose their $1.

30

00:02:16.200  -->  00:02:23.760
Now if the horse does come first you will win $10 and you'll get a $1 back plus $10 so in total 11.

31

00:02:24.090  -->  00:02:31.010
So therefore if you do buy one by the other in the case if this is a losing horse then there's a 1 dollar

32

00:02:31.010  -->  00:02:31.730
loss.

33

00:02:31.770  -->  00:02:40.560
If it's a winning horses attend all win so one will add to $10 is you're losing amount divided by your

34

00:02:40.560  -->  00:02:41.210
winning amount.

35

00:02:41.220  -->  00:02:44.500
However the losing to winning odds are different.

36

00:02:44.530  -->  00:02:45.400
They're inverse.

37

00:02:45.540  -->  00:02:49.240
So basically you have to take the two amounts and flip them.

38

00:02:49.260  -->  00:02:51.840
So the losing two willing odds are ten to one.

39

00:02:51.840  -->  00:02:54.720
Now why is that might be a bit confusing but why is that.

40

00:02:54.720  -->  00:02:59.540
Well because you're getting if if you win you're getting $10.

41

00:02:59.550  -->  00:03:03.930
So obviously that must be a much less likely event than the event of losing.

42

00:03:03.930  -->  00:03:04.330
Right.

43

00:03:04.350  -->  00:03:09.030
Otherwise that company that is running these ads is going to go bankrupt.

44

00:03:09.030  -->  00:03:14.140
So what this means is that you will get $10 if the horse wins.

45

00:03:14.140  -->  00:03:20.330
However it is expected or assumed that this horse will only win one out of 11 times.

46

00:03:20.330  -->  00:03:25.550
So if there's 11 races then one time out of these 11 races the horse might win will win.

47

00:03:25.560  -->  00:03:32.100
That's what this company did this calculation is assuming and on the other hand you are losing $1 you're

48

00:03:32.100  -->  00:03:33.530
losing a tiny amount.

49

00:03:33.570  -->  00:03:34.170
But why is that.

50

00:03:34.170  -->  00:03:41.370
Well because the horse will probably lose 10 out of 11 races and that's how the losing to winning odds

51

00:03:41.370  -->  00:03:41.790
work.

52

00:03:41.790  -->  00:03:48.870
So in this case and $11 odds actually means a losing two winning odds ten to one.

53

00:03:48.900  -->  00:03:57.030
So you might hear the phrase that fame game has 10 to 1 odds meaning that it will only win one out of

54

00:03:57.120  -->  00:04:05.930
11 times and therefore the amounts The repression is associated is calculated through that as well.

55

00:04:05.940  -->  00:04:08.670
So now we want to get to probabilities.

56

00:04:08.670  -->  00:04:10.840
How do we calculate the probability of winning.

57

00:04:11.100  -->  00:04:12.030
Well it's pretty simple.

58

00:04:12.030  -->  00:04:16.860
You just need to add the two numbers 10 plus one is 11 as we said like out of 11 races the horse will

59

00:04:16.860  -->  00:04:18.120
probably win one time.

60

00:04:18.120  -->  00:04:21.270
So you take one divide bill and gives you Serpens or nine.

61

00:04:21.270  -->  00:04:24.150
So there's a 9 percent chance of this horse winning.

62

00:04:24.150  -->  00:04:29.190
Now be careful in terms of terminology at the top you've got losing to winning odds and at the bottom

63

00:04:29.190  -->  00:04:30.620
you've got the possibility of winning.

64

00:04:30.660  -->  00:04:34.950
If you want the ability of losing then it's obviously one most guilty of winning which gives you 91

65

00:04:34.950  -->  00:04:36.790
percent.

66

00:04:36.810  -->  00:04:40.250
Now let's concrete all of this in by putting into a formula.

67

00:04:40.500  -->  00:04:41.340
So some math.

68

00:04:41.340  -->  00:04:42.740
What did we do just that.

69

00:04:43.200  -->  00:04:50.730
If we assume that losing to winning odds is given by this ratio L2 w then what we did just there was

70

00:04:50.910  -->  00:04:55.240
probably the winning equals w divided by W plus L.

71

00:04:55.740  -->  00:05:00.360
So if we get if we take one minus probability of winning it'll give us Al.

72

00:05:00.360  -->  00:05:02.220
Divided by W plus L.

73

00:05:02.220  -->  00:05:06.180
Now if we divide one by the other we'll get probably a winning divide by one when his probability of

74

00:05:06.180  -->  00:05:13.620
winning equals double you divided by L and if we write that then our winning to losing all is so not

75

00:05:13.710  -->  00:05:18.840
losing to any loss but the winning two losing all it's double you divide by L equals probability of

76

00:05:18.840  -->  00:05:21.330
winning divided by one most probability of winning.

77

00:05:21.330  -->  00:05:26.990
Now if we put that old formula This is the formula get win to lose odds equals P divide about 1 minus

78

00:05:27.000  -->  00:05:28.380
speak.

79

00:05:28.380  -->  00:05:31.200
Now this is all we need from this tutorial.

80

00:05:31.320  -->  00:05:33.920
From here you can move onto the next one.

81

00:05:34.050  -->  00:05:35.800
We are going to be working with odds.

82

00:05:35.910  -->  00:05:42.510
However if you want to stick around I wanted to show you something extra a graph a graph of this chart

83

00:05:42.530  -->  00:05:42.570
.

84

00:05:42.600  -->  00:05:50.100
Why I wanted to show it is just so that you kind of can grasp what was going on here and have like a

85

00:05:50.100  -->  00:05:52.370
kind of visual understanding of all in your head.

86

00:05:52.470  -->  00:05:54.330
So feel free to stick around.

87

00:05:54.330  -->  00:05:56.030
I'm going to bring up the chart now.

88

00:05:56.070  -->  00:05:58.120
So here is a Web site.

89

00:05:58.140  -->  00:05:59.240
It's a German web site.

90

00:05:59.250  -->  00:06:02.760
One of the first ones I found googled to Plaut a chart online.

91

00:06:03.060  -->  00:06:09.780
And what are we going to do is we're actually going to just put this formula into here and see what

92

00:06:09.780  -->  00:06:10.640
it plots for us.

93

00:06:10.650  -->  00:06:12.300
This is ex-cricketers default.

94

00:06:12.320  -->  00:06:13.840
That's that's not what we're after.

95

00:06:13.980  -->  00:06:18.780
So let's go ahead and plot plot that so I'm going to take X in this case x is going to be instead of

96

00:06:18.780  -->  00:06:26.060
p right so X divided by 1 minus X going to Plaut and blue and let's draw that.

97

00:06:26.820  -->  00:06:32.940
So what you see here is the function which is which looks like that but we also know that probability

98

00:06:32.940  -->  00:06:38.670
in this case x is always between 0 and 1 so you can only be in between here so let's cut it off at 0

99

00:06:38.670  -->  00:06:42.450
and 1 and let's draw that.

100

00:06:42.450  -->  00:06:46.650
So here is your function right.

101

00:06:46.800  -->  00:06:54.080
Let's maybe change the x axis range so we'll start x axis from 0 and the y axis from 0 as well.

102

00:06:54.090  -->  00:06:55.940
So let's row that again.

103

00:06:56.610  -->  00:07:00.520
And so that is how your function looks as your probability is changing.

104

00:07:00.540  -->  00:07:03.430
Maybe we can also change this bit also.

105

00:07:03.450  -->  00:07:07.320
So x axis goes to 1.

106

00:07:07.320  -->  00:07:09.030
Let's try that.

107

00:07:09.030  -->  00:07:09.950
So there you go.

108

00:07:09.960  -->  00:07:14.760
So here you can see that as X or operability change from 0 to 1.

109

00:07:14.760  -->  00:07:21.540
Like from here to here what happens to your order is it changes from 0 to infinity it goes all the way

110

00:07:21.540  -->  00:07:22.570
to infinity.

111

00:07:22.590  -->  00:07:23.700
And why is this helpful.

112

00:07:23.700  -->  00:07:32.220
Well this shows you that as probability increases your odds you're good odds the odds of winning.

113

00:07:32.220  -->  00:07:36.810
So remember there's two types of odds losing to winning and winning two losing all and the ones we're

114

00:07:36.810  -->  00:07:41.250
talking about here are winning two losing all and those are the ones we are going to be talking throughout

115

00:07:41.250  -->  00:07:45.480
the rest of the trials in the section the winning to losing all odds are increasing.

116

00:07:45.480  -->  00:07:53.190
And that's important because we'll be relying on this information further down that as probability grows

117

00:07:53.390  -->  00:07:53.720
.

118

00:07:53.810  -->  00:07:56.790
Winning two losing odds or the odds ratio is growing as well.

119

00:07:56.790  -->  00:07:59.840
If probability is decreasing the ratio is decreasing as well.

120

00:07:59.880  -->  00:08:02.480
You can already tell that from the fourth formula right away.

121

00:08:02.610  -->  00:08:08.070
But at the same time having this chart visually present in your mind will allow you kind of to remember

122

00:08:08.070  -->  00:08:16.370
this and always be confident in what you're doing and what we're talking about with the odds ratio.

123

00:08:16.410  -->  00:08:18.500
So that's how the odds ratio works.

124

00:08:18.540  -->  00:08:22.020
And we will definitely talk about it more in next tour.

125

00:08:22.020  -->  00:08:27.020
We'll take it where we take it to the next level and I'll look for it.

126

00:08:27.020  -->  00:08:27.740
See you then.

127

00:08:27.750  -->  00:08:29.520
Until next time happy analyzing
