00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:05,730
Hello and welcome back I hope you had a chance to play around with Tablo in terms of the new functionality

2

00:00:05,730  -->  00:00:12,870
that we discussed where you can have several charts on one worksheet and that in turn brings quite a

3

00:00:12,870  -->  00:00:18,100
few tabs over here in the marks pane so you can control the charts separately.

4

00:00:18,360  -->  00:00:23,720
And today as promised we're going to talk a bit about stats and in particular the chi squared test.

5

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:30,750
But don't worry it's still going to be heavy stats will just cover off some like basic intuitive things

6

00:00:30,750  -->  00:00:30,930
.

7

00:00:31,080  -->  00:00:36,920
The heavy stats or not even so heavy that's the main discussion about chi squared.

8

00:00:36,930  -->  00:00:42,000
I've taken it out and put it into two separate tutorials that are at the end of the section so feel

9

00:00:42,000  -->  00:00:47,370
free to check it out if you do want to get into the nuts and bolts of chi square and understand it a

10

00:00:47,370  -->  00:00:48,480
bit better.

11

00:00:48,480  -->  00:00:53,670
However today we're just going to look at the practical application of cry squared.

12

00:00:53,730  -->  00:01:02,730
So what is the whole reason we're doing this why do we want to see the look at the statistical significance

13

00:01:02,760  -->  00:01:05,300
and learn about it a bit more.

14

00:01:05,430  -->  00:01:11,010
Well the reason is all of these results that we're seeing here they're great like we can see that it

15

00:01:11,010  -->  00:01:19,170
looks like it's pretty obvious that for instance age has a SIGINT a significant impact on the choice

16

00:01:19,170  -->  00:01:21,330
of people to stay off the bank or not.

17

00:01:21,330  -->  00:01:26,310
You can see that these age groups are more likely to lead these age groups are less likely to leap.

18

00:01:26,510  -->  00:01:34,140
Now look at another one say We can see that here is gender we can see that gender has a significant

19

00:01:34,200  -->  00:01:34,770
impact.

20

00:01:34,770  -->  00:01:43,230
So being a male customer a female customer impacts or there is an association between gender and the

21

00:01:43,230  -->  00:01:45,960
choice to stay with the bank or leave the bank.

22

00:01:46,210  -->  00:01:53,790
However as you recall I've mentioned a couple of times that this is not the hard statistical test so

23

00:01:54,060  -->  00:02:01,470
it is just a visual interpretation or or a visual improvisation of the test will how do we get confident

24

00:02:01,500  -->  00:02:08,880
with this visual and precision how can we be sure that what we're reporting is actually the result and

25

00:02:08,910  -->  00:02:15,480
that we can use this as insights to drive business decisions and we can communicate this to managers

26

00:02:15,480  -->  00:02:21,750
and executives because we all agree that if we have an inside we're not totally sure about it then it's

27

00:02:21,750  -->  00:02:27,110
kind of not the best idea to report it probably or you will feel as comfortable.

28

00:02:27,150  -->  00:02:30,120
So that's why we need the chi squared test.

29

00:02:30,180  -->  00:02:37,050
And basically what the chi square test will tell us is is this result a statistically significant result

30

00:02:37,060  -->  00:02:37,150
.

31

00:02:37,230  -->  00:02:38,380
So as simple as that.

32

00:02:38,400  -->  00:02:44,770
The chi squared test will tell us that we do observe this difference in the sample.

33

00:02:44,790  -->  00:02:47,100
So in our 10000 records.

34

00:02:47,490  -->  00:02:50,340
Well is this a random difference.

35

00:02:50,340  -->  00:02:51,510
So is it just happened.

36

00:02:51,500  -->  00:02:58,080
Has it happened by chance that there is a difference between female and male or is this a consistent

37

00:02:58,080  -->  00:03:03,780
difference can we surely confidently say that in the whole population of the language can be a million

38

00:03:03,780  -->  00:03:07,010
customers which can be 10 million customers.

39

00:03:07,170  -->  00:03:15,840
Can we confidently say that we will observe a similar discrepancy a similar difference in the whole

40

00:03:15,840  -->  00:03:17,040
population of the bank.

41

00:03:17,040  -->  00:03:19,300
That's that's all the squared test does.

42

00:03:19,320  -->  00:03:26,730
It can tell us whether it's just by chance or there is an actual difference that can be and will be

43

00:03:26,730  -->  00:03:28,810
observed in the population.

44

00:03:28,830  -->  00:03:33,690
So how do we run this case square test once again there's more details in the last two trials of this

45

00:03:33,690  -->  00:03:40,330
section and if you do wish to dive into that please go ahead and check those out because there I talk

46

00:03:40,330  -->  00:03:44,690
about how to run it in Excel and you know all the details about chi squared.

47

00:03:44,730  -->  00:03:51,270
But here I'll just show you some online tools that are very quick and can help you do these things very

48

00:03:51,270  -->  00:03:52,440
ad hoc.

49

00:03:52,440  -->  00:03:54,440
So I'm going to bring up a browser now.

50

00:03:54,810  -->  00:03:57,630
And there are two Web sites that we're going to be looking at.

51

00:03:57,720  -->  00:03:59,970
The first one is w w w.

52

00:04:00,030  -->  00:04:09,110
Evan Miller dot org slash AB Ifan testing slash S.H. I hyphens squared dot HMO.

53

00:04:09,300  -->  00:04:14,790
So you can find lots of these Web sites just if you google for chi square test online you'll find quite

54

00:04:14,790  -->  00:04:22,560
a lot but I kind of fancy this one so we'll talk about this one to start with what you have to do here

55

00:04:22,560  -->  00:04:25,800
is basically input your values.

56

00:04:25,830  -->  00:04:32,690
So now the rule number one here an important rule is that chi squared squarely countered use percentages

57

00:04:32,700  -->  00:04:38,580
you have to use actual values so if you put percentages in here you will get a wrong result.

58

00:04:38,580  -->  00:04:40,820
So getting back to the actuals is very easy.

59

00:04:40,830  -->  00:04:48,090
I'm just going to go back to our Tablo worksheet here I'm going to duplicate the tab duplicate the sheet

60

00:04:48,180  -->  00:04:56,070
and I'll call it gender actuals or you can call absolute's And here we just need to replace the table

61

00:04:56,060  -->  00:05:01,170
calculation so I'll just take number of records I get into here and then drag it in to here as well

62

00:05:01,170  -->  00:05:01,980
.

63

00:05:01,980  -->  00:05:08,990
So there are ups are absolute values and now we can put them into our tool.

64

00:05:09,000  -->  00:05:12,390
The only thing is that we'll also need the absolute total.

65

00:05:12,450  -->  00:05:19,910
So for each of these columns a quick way of doing that is we go to Edit or right click access go add

66

00:05:19,910  -->  00:05:23,300
a reference line and then we'll just sum.

67

00:05:23,310  -->  00:05:24,670
And then we want the sum.

68

00:05:24,690  -->  00:05:26,030
Right.

69

00:05:26,120  -->  00:05:29,340
And we wanted her per cell.

70

00:05:29,340  -->  00:05:34,920
So we wanted just the sum to appear at the top so that we have it for our reference purposes and we

71

00:05:34,920  -->  00:05:36,450
wanted per every cell.

72

00:05:36,660  -->  00:05:41,910
And here we don't want the computation we want the value that's just a quick way of bringing up the

73

00:05:41,910  -->  00:05:43,910
summer without changing a chart.

74

00:05:44,370  -->  00:05:48,450
And now I'm going to bring back the online tool.

75

00:05:48,500  -->  00:05:56,550
So all I have to put here is I'm going to get rid of these values so sample one it's one and we're going

76

00:05:56,550  -->  00:05:58,420
to look at this.

77

00:05:58,430  -->  00:06:02,960
You can choose any one of these as success stayed or exited doesn't really matter.

78

00:06:02,970  -->  00:06:07,310
I'm going to choose exited as I had success in floating quotation marks.

79

00:06:07,560  -->  00:06:11,390
And so I'm going to type in here 1 1 3 9.

80

00:06:11,580  -->  00:06:17,340
The total number of trials or not the total number of observations in this category is four thousand

81

00:06:17,340  -->  00:06:20,250
five hundred forty three four thousand of 143.

82

00:06:20,400  -->  00:06:29,260
And here it's eight hundred ninety eight and the total number of the patients 5 4 5 7.

83

00:06:29,590  -->  00:06:30,130
OK.

84

00:06:30,300  -->  00:06:32,980
So what can we see here.

85

00:06:33,040  -->  00:06:41,040
There is a verdict some pull one is more successful meaning that this summer a female that female customers

86

00:06:41,490  -->  00:06:45,660
have a higher exit rate and it is statistically significant.

87

00:06:45,660  -->  00:06:50,930
Here you can see this P-value is less than zero point 0 1.

88

00:06:51,050  -->  00:06:54,640
What's that we don't talk about p values right now.

89

00:06:54,960  -->  00:07:01,390
And what you will find is that basically if P-value is a P there is less than zero point zero zero point

90

00:07:01,380  -->  00:07:02,430
zero five.

91

00:07:02,430  -->  00:07:06,420
So listen five percent then it's a statistically significant result.

92

00:07:06,420  -->  00:07:13,950
So in our case you can see that it is more likely it is going to be the same in the overall population

93

00:07:13,950  -->  00:07:14,420
of the bank.

94

00:07:14,460  -->  00:07:18,590
Can confidently say that female customers are more likely to exit.

95

00:07:18,840  -->  00:07:25,170
That's how you use a chi squared test using this tool or any other tool basically just full of instructions

96

00:07:25,170  -->  00:07:26,170
that it gives you here.

97

00:07:26,550  -->  00:07:27,740
Let's look at another one.

98

00:07:27,930  -->  00:07:32,610
So we've validated this one and sometimes when say you validate something I like to change the color

99

00:07:32,610  -->  00:07:33,570
of the tab.

100

00:07:33,750  -->  00:07:39,750
Right click the tab and maybe change it to green so that in the future you know that this is a validated

101

00:07:39,750  -->  00:07:40,530
result.

102

00:07:40,590  -->  00:07:46,170
You've checked the chi squared test and you're 100 percent sure that you can report this observation

103

00:07:46,170  -->  00:07:46,230
.

104

00:07:46,230  -->  00:07:51,420
Well basically this observation and these numbers were used to check the chi square test.

105

00:07:51,420  -->  00:07:56,200
Now let's look at this look at it from one that has credit card.

106

00:07:56,250  -->  00:07:57,200
Same thing here right.

107

00:07:57,210  -->  00:08:02,780
So we want to duplicate or even faster if you just duplicate this sheet.

108

00:08:02,790  -->  00:08:03,510
Right.

109

00:08:03,840  -->  00:08:09,960
And then you take the color off because we haven't validated yet and you could rename it has credit

110

00:08:09,960  -->  00:08:12,630
card actuals.

111

00:08:12,960  -->  00:08:18,870
And then here you just need to change gender replace it refresh credit card and then you go so once

112

00:08:18,870  -->  00:08:20,830
again Tablo drag and drop.

113

00:08:20,880  -->  00:08:22,120
Super awesome.

114

00:08:22,230  -->  00:08:28,560
Get rid of the label here so that you can see the total total values and then go back to.

115

00:08:28,860  -->  00:08:29,440
OK.

116

00:08:29,610  -->  00:08:34,430
So here we've got a different different values that's put them in.

117

00:08:34,440  -->  00:08:36,720
Right.

118

00:08:36,730  -->  00:08:48,820
Simple one successes 613 trials 2345 success has 144 trials 7 are 5 5.

119

00:08:49,080  -->  00:08:49,570
All right.

120

00:08:49,620  -->  00:08:54,380
So verdict no significant difference P is very high.

121

00:08:54,500  -->  00:08:57,130
Greater than 5 percent no significant difference.

122

00:08:57,210  -->  00:09:04,020
And as you can see from here it's hard to tell but we already knew that we already said that there's

123

00:09:04,020  -->  00:09:07,860
no significant difference just by looking at this chart over here.

124

00:09:07,910  -->  00:09:11,760
And that speaks of how great this template is.

125

00:09:12,140  -->  00:09:18,480
You don't you can't tell of statistical significance but just by looking at this you can say probably

126

00:09:18,480  -->  00:09:26,160
there's no difference 21 percent 20 percent doesn't really you know doesn't really sound like a significant

127

00:09:26,150  -->  00:09:27,000
difference.

128

00:09:27,000  -->  00:09:29,820
So and this tool has validated that for us.

129

00:09:29,820  -->  00:09:33,910
So we can now confidently report this finding.

130

00:09:33,920  -->  00:09:39,410
So I'm going to change the color of the Stapp to green here and there we go.

131

00:09:39,810  -->  00:09:41,720
So that's how you use a chi square test.

132

00:09:41,730  -->  00:09:47,180
In the case when you have two categories so basically what we're doing here is an AB test if you noticed

133

00:09:47,460  -->  00:09:48,680
we're just doing an AB test.

134

00:09:48,680  -->  00:09:51,750
We're just validating it through a chi squared test.

135

00:09:52,090  -->  00:09:57,860
What we're going to do in the next two trials I'll show you quickly how to approach the situation when

136

00:09:57,870  -->  00:10:03,180
you have more than two categories so when you might have three categories like we have in country or

137

00:10:03,170  -->  00:10:05,290
you might have many categories like you have.

138

00:10:05,310  -->  00:10:06,410
We have an age.

139

00:10:06,600  -->  00:10:11,310
And for now as a suggestion you could practice with a different variable.

140

00:10:11,310  -->  00:10:14,290
For instance we've done gender we've done has credit card.

141

00:10:14,460  -->  00:10:20,390
How bad is active member so you could practice this exercise with is active member and see if you can

142

00:10:20,660  -->  00:10:24,830
confirm that there is a statistical significance between these two.

143

00:10:25,080  -->  00:10:26,710
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

144

00:10:26,820  -->  00:10:28,510
Until then happy analyzing
