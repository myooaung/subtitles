00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:03,490
Hello this is curial And today we're talking about types of variables.

2

00:00:03,900  -->  00:00:08,140
So variables they can be of two distinct types.

3

00:00:08,230  -->  00:00:14,640
One is categorical and categorical variables as the names gests they describe quality or a characteristic

4

00:00:14,640  -->  00:00:15,870
of a data unit.

5

00:00:15,870  -->  00:00:24,150
So basically they're answering the question to What category does this record belong and what what what

6

00:00:24,450  -->  00:00:25,890
are its properties.

7

00:00:25,890  -->  00:00:29,490
So there are two subtypes of categorical variables.

8

00:00:29,490  -->  00:00:37,140
Number one is nominal and nominal variables are observations that cannot be organized into a logical

9

00:00:37,140  -->  00:00:37,660
sequence.

10

00:00:37,770  -->  00:00:43,100
So basically things like gender male or female Let's have a look at a few examples actually.

11

00:00:43,110  -->  00:00:46,860
So male or female you can't order them.

12

00:00:46,860  -->  00:00:53,520
You can say one is greater than the other or the other one is comes first and then comes second.

13

00:00:53,520  -->  00:00:55,160
You can put them in order.

14

00:00:55,170  -->  00:01:00,030
Same thing with red green black with colors you can order them so they basically they do categorize

15

00:01:00,030  -->  00:01:06,720
your data but you cannot do anything about it you can't put them into a chronological or any kind of

16

00:01:06,720  -->  00:01:11,900
order and that's why they're called nominals So basically a good way to remember this is like name is

17

00:01:11,940  -->  00:01:19,860
so nominal and the word names they sound similar and therefore as with names you can order them nominal

18

00:01:19,860  -->  00:01:22,080
where variables you can order them either.

19

00:01:22,080  -->  00:01:25,830
The other subtype of categorical variables are ordinal variables.

20

00:01:25,830  -->  00:01:28,630
So these are variables which are categorical.

21

00:01:28,650  -->  00:01:30,340
But you can order them.

22

00:01:30,350  -->  00:01:32,380
So let's have a look at a few examples.

23

00:01:32,550  -->  00:01:39,930
So for instance small medium large these categories they say in terms of clothes in a store you can

24

00:01:39,930  -->  00:01:48,180
break down your clothes into groups based on what size the label states small medium or large.

25

00:01:48,300  -->  00:01:56,460
And moreover you can order them so you can put these groups of clothes in a logical order meaning that

26

00:01:57,090  -->  00:02:02,970
clothes in this batch are bigger than the clothes in this batch and then they're bigger than the clothes

27

00:02:03,000  -->  00:02:08,880
in the smallest batch unserviceable think of grade's ABC So you know is the highest grade B is the next

28

00:02:08,880  -->  00:02:12,030
grade C is the lower grade and so on.

29

00:02:12,060  -->  00:02:19,170
So even though their order even though they don't have numbers here they have a logical inherent order

30

00:02:19,170  -->  00:02:20,340
within them.

31

00:02:20,460  -->  00:02:24,300
And so those those are the two different types of categorical variables.

32

00:02:24,300  -->  00:02:29,220
Now if we move on to the other type of variables we will go to numeric.

33

00:02:29,290  -->  00:02:36,780
So numeric variables are basically numbers and there are two types of numeric variables and these variables

34

00:02:36,780  -->  00:02:39,320
actually overall numeric variables.

35

00:02:39,320  -->  00:02:42,120
They answer the question how much or how many.

36

00:02:42,120  -->  00:02:48,920
So for instance there are discrete numeric variables and discrete numeric variables.

37

00:02:49,680  -->  00:03:01,200
They are basically whole numbers so how many units of something or they are or how much of something

38

00:03:01,290  -->  00:03:02,120
occurred.

39

00:03:02,250  -->  00:03:06,570
But Econ. it can be a fraction of a number and let's have a look at a few examples here as well.

40

00:03:06,570  -->  00:03:13,020
So for instance 1 2 3 5 10 100 businesses you can have one and a half businesses right you can have

41

00:03:13,320  -->  00:03:20,760
2 1 2 5 businesses so basically it can be they can be an infinite number of observations that doesn't

42

00:03:20,760  -->  00:03:21,090
matter.

43

00:03:21,090  -->  00:03:28,320
But as long as there's nothing in between so there's a there's two businesses there's three businesses

44

00:03:28,350  -->  00:03:31,100
but there's nothing in between you can have a value in between same.

45

00:03:31,100  -->  00:03:32,050
Same with people.

46

00:03:32,160  -->  00:03:39,300
You can have 168 people you can have 567 people but there's nothing in between so you can't find another

47

00:03:39,300  -->  00:03:46,130
variable between two sets discrete variables that are that come in sequence.

48

00:03:46,260  -->  00:03:53,220
And finally the last type of numeric variables or overall variables that we're going to look at is continuous

49

00:03:53,220  -->  00:03:58,020
variables so continuous variables are a subtype of many variables.

50

00:03:58,050  -->  00:04:00,550
They also answer the question how many or how much.

51

00:04:00,600  -->  00:04:05,100
But unlike discrete variables they can be a fraction.

52

00:04:05,100  -->  00:04:07,220
For instance age or height.

53

00:04:07,230  -->  00:04:12,090
So you can be a hundred and seventy three meters tall you can be a hundred and seventy three and a half

54

00:04:12,090  -->  00:04:12,900
meters tall.

55

00:04:12,900  -->  00:04:19,710
So basically any two continuous variables that you take are continuous values that you take on your

56

00:04:20,310  -->  00:04:21,040
scale.

57

00:04:21,090  -->  00:04:25,590
Say one hundred one hundred seventy three and one hundred and in three and a half there will always

58

00:04:25,590  -->  00:04:29,890
be another continuous variable between them so one hundred seventy three point to five.

59

00:04:30,090  -->  00:04:37,140
And even if you take 173 point to five and 173 and a half they'll still be another one in between them

60

00:04:37,140  -->  00:04:38,150
173.

61

00:04:38,160  -->  00:04:40,470
Point 2 5 7 and so on.

62

00:04:40,470  -->  00:04:47,820
So there's always another variable between any two or there's always another value between any two continuous

63

00:04:47,820  -->  00:04:53,240
values so they can be of course restricted at a minimum maximum so it can be lower.

64

00:04:53,520  -->  00:04:59,330
Or for instance with age you can be younger than 0 years old and you can be older than 150 unless your

65

00:04:59,340  -->  00:05:02,810
medicine goes through the roof in the next couple of years.

66

00:05:02,850  -->  00:05:10,440
So there are there can be restrictions but within those boundaries there is an unlimited number of values

67

00:05:10,530  -->  00:05:12,570
that the variable can take.

68

00:05:12,570  -->  00:05:18,570
So those are four types of variables nominal ordinal discrete continues.

69

00:05:18,680  -->  00:05:21,630
Have a look around you try to think of other examples.

70

00:05:21,630  -->  00:05:25,920
It's a very good exercise to remember these four different types
