00:00:00.690  -->  00:00:12.510
As is as welcome to part three of the data science aitches that course as you have guessed from the

2

00:00:12.510  -->  00:00:14.830
name this part is about data preparation.

3

00:00:15.000  -->  00:00:18.890
Well Carol why are we spending so much time on daughter preparation you'll ask.

4

00:00:19.050  -->  00:00:25.560
Well the reason is that from experience the work of a data scientist is at least 70 percent daughter

5

00:00:25.560  -->  00:00:26.160
preparation.

6

00:00:26.160  -->  00:00:27.610
On any given project.

7

00:00:27.720  -->  00:00:32.120
And that's if you know what you're doing if you don't then it's probably much more than that.

8

00:00:32.400  -->  00:00:36.510
And to be honest though a lot of course is out there they don't teach you that preparation.

9

00:00:36.600  -->  00:00:37.410
You come in.

10

00:00:37.620  -->  00:00:43.260
You learn to program you learn to build a model the door is nice and fluffy and everything goes smoothly

11

00:00:43.500  -->  00:00:45.030
and then you're out in the real world.

12

00:00:45.120  -->  00:00:52.050
Your first project and bam you get a code page error or a text qualifier error or a truncation or something

13

00:00:52.050  -->  00:00:53.440
like that and you don't know what to do.

14

00:00:53.500  -->  00:00:57.060
And it's like a slap in the face like what was all that training for.

15

00:00:57.150  -->  00:00:59.820
Will this course fills that major gap.

16

00:00:59.820  -->  00:01:02.390
I have been there I have seen the Good the Bad and The Ugly.

17

00:01:02.430  -->  00:01:07.740
And I have an ethical duty to make sure that when you graduate this course you know how to deal with

18

00:01:07.740  -->  00:01:08.640
real world data.

19

00:01:08.730  -->  00:01:13.650
And that is exactly what we're going to be focusing on in this part of the course.

20

00:01:13.800  -->  00:01:17.170
These sections are going to be extremely hard metaphorically speaking.

21

00:01:17.200  -->  00:01:22.230
They're going to beat you to the ground and the data is going to be so cruel that you'll just want to

22

00:01:22.230  -->  00:01:27.930
rip the hair out of your head and that's not all in these sections you're actually also going to have

23

00:01:27.930  -->  00:01:31.200
homework homework when you're conscious full along the tutorial.

24

00:01:31.290  -->  00:01:34.990
You have to do it all on your own and apply the skills that you've learned.

25

00:01:35.190  -->  00:01:40.740
But the good news is that if you can succeed through these sections then you can succeed in the real

26

00:01:40.740  -->  00:01:41.420
world.

27

00:01:41.730  -->  00:01:46.380
Finally I wanted to mention that in this part of the course we'll be using Microsoft tools.

28

00:01:46.510  -->  00:01:53.290
We'll be using the SAS and Eskew and by default most large companies also use Microsoft tools.

29

00:01:53.310  -->  00:01:58.530
However if you find that your company doesn't use Microsoft tools and uses of their software then I

30

00:01:58.530  -->  00:02:03.660
recommend that you still go through these tutorials and then later you can adapt what you've learned

31

00:02:03.960  -->  00:02:09.160
to your tools because the main focus of these sections is not learning the tools.

32

00:02:09.190  -->  00:02:15.120
It's rather learning the concepts learning the framework and learning the blueprints that we'll be using

33

00:02:15.390  -->  00:02:18.210
for our daughter preparation process.

34

00:02:18.390  -->  00:02:22.450
And I can't wait to see you on the first Tauriel of this part of the course.

35

00:02:22.470  -->  00:02:23.760
Let's jump straight into
