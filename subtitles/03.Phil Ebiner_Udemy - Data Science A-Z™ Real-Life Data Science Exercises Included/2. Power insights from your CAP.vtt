00:00:00.660  -->  00:00:06.810
Today we'll talk about drawing insights from ACAP curve the cap curve is actually a very very very powerful

2

00:00:06.810  -->  00:00:07.890
feature in modeling.

3

00:00:07.890  -->  00:00:12.710
And you can derive lots of valuable insights for your business just from this one tool.

4

00:00:12.930  -->  00:00:14.960
So let's see what we can get from him.

5

00:00:14.970  -->  00:00:16.740
We're going to look at three things.

6

00:00:16.740  -->  00:00:23.280
The first one is the obvious benefit of the likelihood score so the score that we get by running our

7

00:00:23.280  -->  00:00:30.530
model tells us which customers are most likely to leave the company in this case is its the company

8

00:00:30.570  -->  00:00:39.690
could be take take up an offer or for which observations the event is most like a Turk or so where is

9

00:00:39.690  -->  00:00:46.620
it most likely that's the dependent variable will be a yes a one and not a zero.

10

00:00:46.620  -->  00:00:55.860
So this score allows us to already derive insights and we can Ranko customers we can create deciles

11

00:00:55.880  -->  00:01:02.910
or quartal and address different groups of customers differently so if they have a high score then they'll

12

00:01:02.910  -->  00:01:07.830
have one treatment if they have a low score they'll have a different treatment maybe a little bit different

13

00:01:07.860  -->  00:01:12.120
or for maybe it'll be a different type of message and things like that.

14

00:01:12.120  -->  00:01:13.380
So that's the first thing.

15

00:01:13.380  -->  00:01:17.640
And that's kind of before the cap score that's already an obvious benefit for the business.

16

00:01:17.640  -->  00:01:25.330
Just having this ranking available saw a new parameter of your customers gives you a lot of insights

17

00:01:25.380  -->  00:01:26.930
and which you can work with.

18

00:01:26.970  -->  00:01:29.340
Now the cap curve itself gives you two main things.

19

00:01:29.340  -->  00:01:33.990
The first one has to do with budget constraints let's say let's forget about this situation for a second

20

00:01:33.990  -->  00:01:39.570
that we're dealing with customers that are churning and let's imagine that the model that we've constructed

21

00:01:39.930  -->  00:01:47.610
is for customers that take up an offer so basically we sent an e-mail offer and we build a model to

22

00:01:47.610  -->  00:01:52.710
see what is the likelihood of customers actually clicking on our link and buying the product so the

23

00:01:52.710  -->  00:01:58.630
end result that we're measuring the dependent variable is did the customer buy the product or not.

24

00:01:58.680  -->  00:02:07.230
And in that case here we've got a total number of customers that we in our test was 10000 total number

25

00:02:07.230  -->  00:02:10.040
that bought the product was 2000 percent.

26

00:02:10.170  -->  00:02:11.580
That board was 20 percent.

27

00:02:11.580  -->  00:02:17.640
And here we also have the same score but this time it means that the likelihood of the customers by

28

00:02:17.730  -->  00:02:23.670
the predicted probability that the customer this specific customer in this number will actually go ahead

29

00:02:23.700  -->  00:02:25.370
and purchase the product.

30

00:02:25.710  -->  00:02:28.160
And what does the cap curve tell us in that case.

31

00:02:28.170  -->  00:02:33.600
Well it allows us to once again we're using the ranking to create the cap curve.

32

00:02:33.720  -->  00:02:38.250
So at the start we'll have the most likely customers to buy at the end will have the least likely customers

33

00:02:38.250  -->  00:02:38.780
to buy.

34

00:02:38.790  -->  00:02:46.020
Now when we talk about budget constraints this is a very very common feature and this is something that

35

00:02:46.050  -->  00:02:51.420
you might come across in a marketing department and a company and let's say they can only send this

36

00:02:51.420  -->  00:02:54.260
e-mail to a certain number of customers.

37

00:02:54.290  -->  00:02:57.240
We of course e-mail isn't that expensive to send.

38

00:02:57.240  -->  00:03:04.710
It costs maybe like I don't know have the exact figures but I would assume maybe about one cent or 10

39

00:03:05.200  -->  00:03:09.570
one tenth of a cent to send an e-mail or something like that but it still cost some money.

40

00:03:09.570  -->  00:03:17.930
So if a company has 10 million customers and even if it costs one tenth of a cent to send an e-mail

41

00:03:17.940  -->  00:03:24.300
right so that's sort of you're going to want to get a good to make a $10000 just to send all of those

42

00:03:24.420  -->  00:03:30.480
e-mails and obviously the marketing department has other activities to do so they might allocate a certain

43

00:03:30.780  -->  00:03:36.120
amount of money just for this specific activity and might not be sufficient to cover all of the customers

44

00:03:36.120  -->  00:03:37.160
of the company.

45

00:03:37.380  -->  00:03:39.980
And in that case you have to pick and choose who you send to.

46

00:03:40.080  -->  00:03:46.710
If you don't have a model then you will have to send to a random sample of let's say let's say you have

47

00:03:46.710  -->  00:03:49.700
10 million customers and you can only send it to five million.

48

00:03:49.800  -->  00:03:53.640
In that case you would have to select a random sample of five billion just send it to them.

49

00:03:53.700  -->  00:03:57.540
But if you have a model then it's very obvious who you're going to send it to you're going to send it

50

00:03:57.540  -->  00:04:04.830
to these first 50 percent that are ranked here in the top 50 percent because they have the highest likelihood

51

00:04:04.830  -->  00:04:05.710
of responding.

52

00:04:05.850  -->  00:04:09.870
And in fact you can tell right away from the cap curve you can go back to the marketing manager and

53

00:04:09.870  -->  00:04:16.230
say look I have a model I've built a model for you and you can if you even if you send to 50 percent

54

00:04:16.290  -->  00:04:20.270
of the overall base of all customers you said this offer.

55

00:04:20.460  -->  00:04:22.930
You will already hit 80 percent of the Chanters.

56

00:04:23.040  -->  00:04:30.150
So yes ideally or 80 percent of the people who are most likely to take up the offer let's fix up this

57

00:04:30.150  -->  00:04:34.050
access here so it's not confusing us.

58

00:04:34.080  -->  00:04:37.190
So maximum will be one right.

59

00:04:37.700  -->  00:04:38.880
It's close that.

60

00:04:38.910  -->  00:04:46.540
So that makes more makes it a bit better to visualize right so what are you saying is it would be ideal

61

00:04:46.650  -->  00:04:52.780
if the marquee magic could send it to everybody and then he would obviously hit 100 percent of the people

62

00:04:52.770  -->  00:04:56.200
that are likely to actually take up the offer.

63

00:04:56.340  -->  00:04:57.910
But you're kind of.

64

00:04:58.380  -->  00:05:03.690
You understand you and the market manager that you both understand that this is budget constraint and

65

00:05:03.880  -->  00:05:07.370
you can only send it to 50 percent of customers if you sense it randomly.

66

00:05:07.440  -->  00:05:07.650
Right.

67

00:05:07.650  -->  00:05:12.710
If he sends it to a random 50 percent of his of the customers of the company he'll obviously hit you

68

00:05:12.730  -->  00:05:18.030
look at you looking at this blue line he'll obviously only get 50 percent of the people that churn which

69

00:05:18.030  -->  00:05:18.660
makes sense right.

70

00:05:18.670  -->  00:05:23.260
If you take 50 percent of a sample you'll get 50 percent of.

71

00:05:23.400  -->  00:05:28.060
I keep saying you'll get 50 percent of the people that are actually going to take up the offer.

72

00:05:28.260  -->  00:05:35.700
But if he uses your model then if he sends it to 50 percent of the people in the company according to

73

00:05:35.700  -->  00:05:43.230
your moral according to your ranking then he will actually benefit because you'll contact who knows

74

00:05:43.240  -->  00:05:49.420
that he'll contact about 80 percent of the people who will take up the offer so he's getting more for

75

00:05:49.410  -->  00:05:51.740
the value more for the money that he's investing.

76

00:05:51.750  -->  00:05:55.570
He's expecting to he only get 50 percent of the people that will take up the offer.

77

00:05:55.600  -->  00:05:57.020
He'll actually get 80 percent.

78

00:05:57.150  -->  00:06:03.010
And that is how these models and the cap curve can help you in situations with a budget constraint.

79

00:06:03.000  -->  00:06:09.690
So even if he can only contract 25 right over here you might see that defect is even even stronger So

80

00:06:09.690  -->  00:06:13.300
here you're going from 50 sort of 50 you're going to 80 percent.

81

00:06:13.440  -->  00:06:13.780
Yeah.

82

00:06:13.870  -->  00:06:21.490
So that's a 30 percent increase so a relative increase of just over then just more than half right over

83

00:06:21.490  -->  00:06:21.750
here.

84

00:06:21.750  -->  00:06:25.110
This this part is just more than half of this part.

85

00:06:25.220  -->  00:06:31.240
Well whereas if you only have 25 right if you go and you can take 25 percent of the people then you're

86

00:06:31.240  -->  00:06:38.220
going from 25 percent of the people will take up the offer you go all the way to 55 percent of people

87

00:06:38.230  -->  00:06:41.700
to go for your more than doubling his expectation over here.

88

00:06:41.700  -->  00:06:43.170
So that's that will.

89

00:06:43.200  -->  00:06:49.480
That's like a normal thing to observe whenever you're to the left of the halfway line you're more likely

90

00:06:49.480  -->  00:06:54.880
to increase the benefit substantially when you go to the right.

91

00:06:54.880  -->  00:06:59.570
The benefit is increased less because the curve is much steeper here.

92

00:06:59.620  -->  00:07:04.650
So you can already tell that whatever budget constraint you have you can add a lot of value to the business

93

00:07:04.660  -->  00:07:10.750
so like even here instead of Qanta if you can say it's 8.3 percent of the customers you can help him

94

00:07:11.110  -->  00:07:15.520
reach twenty two percent of the people that are likely to take up the offer.

95

00:07:15.510  -->  00:07:18.720
What's a value add to the business.

96

00:07:18.730  -->  00:07:20.810
Marketing Manager will love you for this.

97

00:07:20.810  -->  00:07:22.890
This is this is incredible stuff.

98

00:07:23.130  -->  00:07:28.280
So that's that's the one first main benefit of the cap curve.

99

00:07:28.440  -->  00:07:31.750
And the second benefit of the cap curve is efficiency.

100

00:07:31.750  -->  00:07:38.980
So sometimes you might not have a budget constraint like this but at the same time what's the point

101

00:07:39.000  -->  00:07:47.790
of sending the email to a hundred people when you can send it 100 percent when you can send it to less

102

00:07:47.860  -->  00:07:50.590
and still get approximately the same result.

103

00:07:50.590  -->  00:07:57.010
So let's go back to our example of Tzschirner is right here.

104

00:07:57.000  -->  00:08:02.100
For instance let's say you you can contact all of your customers in your company and then you'll definitely

105

00:08:02.110  -->  00:08:03.430
hit the 100 percent mark.

106

00:08:03.610  -->  00:08:09.600
But at the same time you already know that these people on the on the back of this curve they're very

107

00:08:09.610  -->  00:08:11.310
unlikely to leave the company.

108

00:08:11.310  -->  00:08:15.180
The likelihood of churning is very low compared to these people.

109

00:08:15.220  -->  00:08:15.420
Right.

110

00:08:15.430  -->  00:08:16.510
So that's number one.

111

00:08:16.500  -->  00:08:22.890
Number two is even if you contact So this is somewhere about 80 percent no that's on 80 percent that's

112

00:08:22.930  -->  00:08:24.100
80 percent.

113

00:08:24.100  -->  00:08:25.140
So this is even less.

114

00:08:25.140  -->  00:08:26.850
This is about 70 percent.

115

00:08:26.880  -->  00:08:33.350
So even if you contact about 70 percent of your customers in your bank you will already conta you will

116

00:08:33.360  -->  00:08:40.740
already cover approximately 91 percent of the people that are likely to leave your company.

117

00:08:40.770  -->  00:08:41.940
They are likely to leave your bank.

118

00:08:42.030  -->  00:08:45.230
So that is very close to 100 percent.

119

00:08:45.250  -->  00:08:46.070
That's number one.

120

00:08:46.070  -->  00:08:51.150
Number two is that the remaining nine percent are actually very very unlikely to leave your bank.

121

00:08:51.150  -->  00:08:53.400
The likelihood is is minimal.

122

00:08:53.560  -->  00:08:59.410
So therefore you're saving these 30 percent the money that you would spend on contacting these people

123

00:08:59.400  -->  00:08:59.610
.

124

00:08:59.620  -->  00:09:04.240
And not only the money that's also messaging people were followed.

125

00:09:04.330  -->  00:09:11.160
You can't send too many e-mails to the same person in a month or even in a quarter because they'll consider

126

00:09:11.150  -->  00:09:14.370
it as spam and they'll you know it's not a good customer experience.

127

00:09:14.380  -->  00:09:18.250
So you're saving the money and you're saving the people the trouble of having to read this e-mail which

128

00:09:18.250  -->  00:09:19.830
isn't that relevant to them.

129

00:09:19.950  -->  00:09:27.530
And you're still getting a lot of the potential churn is getting 90 percent of the people that are there

130

00:09:27.690  -->  00:09:28.670
actually going to churn.

131

00:09:28.670  -->  00:09:35.250
So getting 90 percent of the people that will churn even if you contact just 70 percent of the customers

132

00:09:35.560  -->  00:09:36.890
you get 91 percent.

133

00:09:37.090  -->  00:09:39.340
So I think that's that's a good tradeoff.

134

00:09:39.370  -->  00:09:45.810
You save money you save people the trouble of reading your e-mail and you get the most likely ones that

135

00:09:45.820  -->  00:09:51.330
are going to churn the company just by contacting about 70 percent of the customers so this talks about

136

00:09:51.340  -->  00:09:57.880
efficiency how you can add efficiency to existing business processes through looking at the cap curve

137

00:09:57.900  -->  00:10:04.040
and creating models like this and that those are the two main benefits that you can derive.

138

00:10:04.060  -->  00:10:05.850
So budget constraints and efficiency.

139

00:10:05.910  -->  00:10:10.980
Let's recap quickly on what we learned in this tutorial because I feel this is quite important stuff

140

00:10:11.560  -->  00:10:12.820
inside from your cap.

141

00:10:12.850  -->  00:10:15.480
The first one was actually before the cap curve.

142

00:10:15.550  -->  00:10:19.800
This is the likelihood score and this is the score that you get for your customers.

143

00:10:19.810  -->  00:10:27.730
It adds another dimension to your understanding of your customers and allows you to work with food and

144

00:10:27.730  -->  00:10:33.970
create offers based off of it or segment of customers according to that new dimension.

145

00:10:33.960  -->  00:10:39.630
It's a very insightful feature that can be used across the business for different for lots of various

146

00:10:39.630  -->  00:10:45.240
things that you might be required to do with your customers.

147

00:10:45.250  -->  00:10:51.970
Number two is budget constraints so you can use a cap curb directly to understand who to contact to

148

00:10:51.960  -->  00:10:53.820
get the best bang for your buck.

149

00:10:54.420  -->  00:10:59.170
If you have a budget constraint in your marketing department or whatever department you're creating

150

00:10:59.160  -->  00:11:08.440
this model for this can really really help get the best outcome for the investment into this activity

151

00:11:08.450  -->  00:11:08.760
.

152

00:11:09.370  -->  00:11:13.040
And three efficiencies sometimes you won't even have budget constraints.

153

00:11:13.050  -->  00:11:21.990
But creating a model and building a cap curve will help you increase efficiency in terms of understanding

154

00:11:22.200  -->  00:11:27.100
where to stop when when to draw the line of who you want to call into a food you want.

155

00:11:27.110  -->  00:11:32.190
You don't want to contact and this doesn't only have to do with contacting people and in customer related

156

00:11:32.190  -->  00:11:36.750
companies this can be in any type of organization where are you creating this model.

157

00:11:36.750  -->  00:11:39.050
It will help you understand where to draw that line.

158

00:11:39.270  -->  00:11:42.240
And actually the last thing I wanted to mention before we go.

159

00:11:42.450  -->  00:11:45.520
Sometimes the cap won't have a flat profile like this.

160

00:11:45.510  -->  00:11:50.970
Sometimes there might be kinks in here even even in our cap Carucci a little bit of a kink over here

161

00:11:51.180  -->  00:11:57.280
a little bit of a kink over here then a bit of a kink a few kinks that were here but they're not that

162

00:11:57.490  -->  00:11:58.300
pronounced.

163

00:11:58.380  -->  00:12:03.010
If you have more pronounced kinks which of course you have to make sure that they're not crazy if your

164

00:12:03.000  -->  00:12:06.540
cap curves are going all over the place and something is wrong with your model.

165

00:12:06.630  -->  00:12:11.430
But if your kids are a bit more pronounced than they are here then that can give you some hints where

166

00:12:11.430  -->  00:12:13.070
to set the cutoff points.

167

00:12:13.120  -->  00:12:16.540
So let's say for instance you want to set a cutoff point in terms of efficiency.

168

00:12:16.620  -->  00:12:19.890
Somewhere between 20 percent.

169

00:12:19.990  -->  00:12:26.320
So between this line here and let's say 40 percent so between the story here and you don't know where

170

00:12:26.320  -->  00:12:29.860
to set it you can pretty much set it anywhere you can set at the maximum at the minimum.

171

00:12:29.980  -->  00:12:34.660
But then you see a Kinko over here and you see that the cap curve is growing really fast before the

172

00:12:34.800  -->  00:12:38.840
kink and then let's say on anything it flows out and then it grows slowly.

173

00:12:38.980  -->  00:12:45.270
Well that getting a hint that any investment additional investment that you make after the kink into

174

00:12:45.270  -->  00:12:51.240
this specific project or into this specific activity is going to yield a much lower return on investment

175

00:12:51.310  -->  00:12:53.100
than what you had before the king.

176

00:12:53.230  -->  00:12:58.570
And that might be a good place for you to set the cutoff point so you set a right before the kink if

177

00:12:58.570  -->  00:13:01.220
it if the curve that flattens out afterwards.

178

00:13:01.480  -->  00:13:08.190
And that way whatever you're losing between the place where you set off the kind of point and your maximum

179

00:13:08.190  -->  00:13:11.380
threshold for the kind of point is not going to be as great.

180

00:13:11.380  -->  00:13:16.560
So basically you're finding a great place to set your cutoff point just by looking at the profile of

181

00:13:16.570  -->  00:13:17.720
your Kepcher.

182

00:13:17.940  -->  00:13:19.390
Once again that's are all the time.

183

00:13:19.380  -->  00:13:27.840
Sometimes the model will give you hints and ideas like that and going back to our presentation one two

184

00:13:27.990  -->  00:13:28.700
and three.

185

00:13:28.710  -->  00:13:31.300
Likelihood score budget constraints and efficiency.

186

00:13:31.380  -->  00:13:34.580
Those are the three things that you can derive from your model.

187

00:13:34.600  -->  00:13:37.830
The last two are directly from a cap curve.

188

00:13:38.050  -->  00:13:44.190
And I hope that these techniques will help you to help other people in your company and also worked

189

00:13:44.190  -->  00:13:48.440
around budget constraints and add efficiency to existing business processes.

190

00:13:48.520  -->  00:13:50.100
And I look forward to seeing your next slide.

191

00:13:50.160  -->  00:13:51.690
Until then happy analyzing
