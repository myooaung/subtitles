00:00:00.720  -->  00:00:03.430
This tutorial we'll be talking about data warehousing.

2

00:00:03.720  -->  00:00:09.560
As we discussed the data preparation phase consists of two major steps T.L. and database.

3

00:00:09.570  -->  00:00:12.240
We will cover off the tail step further in the course.

4

00:00:12.240  -->  00:00:18.150
And today we'll talk about the database step data warehousing simply means storing the data in a relational

5

00:00:18.150  -->  00:00:19.080
database.

6

00:00:19.080  -->  00:00:23.960
However the term data warehousing implies that this is not a transactional database.

7

00:00:24.060  -->  00:00:30.990
Rather it is specifically designed to store data that will be analyzed and visualized to derive insights

8

00:00:30.990  -->  00:00:31.700
.

9

00:00:31.710  -->  00:00:34.110
So what is a relational database.

10

00:00:34.200  -->  00:00:38.700
And here before we continue I just wanted to quickly say that if you are already very comfortable of

11

00:00:38.700  -->  00:00:42.530
databases then feel free to skip the rest of this tutorial.

12

00:00:42.540  -->  00:00:43.010
All right.

13

00:00:43.110  -->  00:00:47.300
So here you can see that there is an asterix near relational.

14

00:00:47.310  -->  00:00:50.510
This is because there is also another type of databases.

15

00:00:50.700  -->  00:00:55.710
Non-relational however to keep things simple we won't talk about them right now.

16

00:00:55.710  -->  00:01:01.590
We will discuss no relational databases in the introductory section of Hadoop.

17

00:01:01.650  -->  00:01:08.490
Later on in this course or relational database as the name suggests is a one where the relations between

18

00:01:08.490  -->  00:01:11.320
data within the database matters.

19

00:01:11.490  -->  00:01:16.650
In simplest terms this means that data is stored in tables which have rows and columns and the tables

20

00:01:16.650  -->  00:01:19.560
can be linked through common columns.

21

00:01:19.620  -->  00:01:22.230
Here you see an example of a relational database.

22

00:01:22.230  -->  00:01:29.100
Basically a database is very similar to an Excel document and tables in a database are just like tabs

23

00:01:29.130  -->  00:01:30.880
in the Excel spreadsheet.

24

00:01:30.960  -->  00:01:34.760
However a database has numerous advantages over Excel.

25

00:01:34.770  -->  00:01:36.890
Let's have a look at some of them.

26

00:01:36.900  -->  00:01:43.380
Number one integrity while in excel every cell is separate and you can place anything you want into

27

00:01:43.380  -->  00:01:43.620
it.

28

00:01:43.620  -->  00:01:48.060
For example date number a text and so on.

29

00:01:48.180  -->  00:01:54.090
In a database comb's have predefined types and therefore if your column is designed to contain numbers

30

00:01:54.180  -->  00:02:00.480
it cannot contain a text or it cannot contain a date or any other type of information and vice versa

31

00:02:00.490  -->  00:02:00.860
.

32

00:02:01.230  -->  00:02:06.090
The second advantage is that combining data sets in a database is easy.

33

00:02:06.090  -->  00:02:09.560
That is how they are designed as you will see further in the scores.

34

00:02:09.570  -->  00:02:15.690
It is very natural to join tables to create new tables and derive insights on the other hand.

35

00:02:15.690  -->  00:02:21.840
In Excel you would have to use tools like the view lookup function which is much more complicated and

36

00:02:22.110  -->  00:02:28.650
much less efficient and a great plus of databases is that they are easily scalable.

37

00:02:28.650  -->  00:02:35.190
You can have five rows or five billion rows and Iran crash whereas Excel is much more limited in that

38

00:02:35.190  -->  00:02:40.270
sense and its performance becomes much slower as your daughter said grows.

39

00:02:40.440  -->  00:02:44.440
There are more advantages of databases which we won't go through at this stage.

40

00:02:44.460  -->  00:02:50.280
You will discover them as we progress through this course and to sum up databases of the next level

41

00:02:50.280  -->  00:02:51.190
up from Excel.

42

00:02:51.210  -->  00:02:55.870
Once you get a grip over databases you won't want to use Excel anymore.

43

00:02:56.160  -->  00:03:00.060
By the way here's the icon that represents databases and diagrams.

44

00:03:00.060  -->  00:03:05.570
Get used to it because you will be seeing it quite often and to finish off today's tutorial.

45

00:03:05.730  -->  00:03:11.110
This course will be working with skill database's skill stands for structured query language.

46

00:03:11.160  -->  00:03:15.720
That is because to manipulate data in this type of database you need to write queries.

47

00:03:15.780  -->  00:03:21.760
For example this code was used to display the table you saw in the previous slide but don't be aware

48

00:03:21.790  -->  00:03:21.890
.

49

00:03:22.080  -->  00:03:27.000
Skewl scripting language is very simple and you will see this from further tutorials in this course

50

00:03:27.010  -->  00:03:27.970
.
