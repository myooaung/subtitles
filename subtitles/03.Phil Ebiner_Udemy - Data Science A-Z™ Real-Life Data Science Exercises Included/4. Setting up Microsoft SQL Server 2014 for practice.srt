00:00:00,860  -->  00:00:06,210
In this tutorial we're going to install a school server on to our computers and if you really have a

2

00:00:06,210  -->  00:00:11,580
SQL Server installed or if you're doing these exercises at work on your server there then feel free

3

00:00:11,580  -->  00:00:12,940
to skip this tutorial.

4

00:00:13,020  -->  00:00:19,890
However to have a look at the next one where I explain the importance of creating a test database and

5

00:00:19,920  -->  00:00:26,040
how to talk to your database administrator at work to make sure that you can set up a safe environment

6

00:00:26,310  -->  00:00:33,990
where you won't damage any of the existing databases and tables by doing these exercises to start off

7

00:00:33,990  -->  00:00:43,110
with if you're going to need a browser go to Google and search for a school Server Express and then

8

00:00:43,110  -->  00:00:46,840
just click on the top link that should take the right place.

9

00:00:46,840  -->  00:00:51,630
Now bear in mind that this Web site changes all the time and it might look different at the time you're

10

00:00:51,630  -->  00:00:55,240
taking this Clauss But never mind.

11

00:00:55,560  -->  00:00:59,290
As long as you can get a skill Server Express that is great.

12

00:00:59,520  -->  00:01:04,340
And here you can see that express the Express Edition is the free edition.

13

00:01:04,350  -->  00:01:05,190
It's free to use.

14

00:01:05,190  -->  00:01:12,520
It has limitations in terms of capacity of the database and how much ram it can use and so on.

15

00:01:12,630  -->  00:01:18,720
But that doesn't really concern us because we're going to be using it for educational purposes and here

16

00:01:18,720  -->  00:01:20,500
you can download a SQL Server.

17

00:01:20,580  -->  00:01:27,260
Before we proceed I would like to say that we are going to be working with reskill server 2014 in this

18

00:01:27,260  -->  00:01:28,700
series of tutorials.

19

00:01:28,890  -->  00:01:34,290
If there is a later version when you're watching the Clauss you can go ahead and take that one although

20

00:01:34,350  -->  00:01:39,450
it would be a bit more beneficial if you had the exact same version that we're working with here so

21

00:01:39,450  -->  00:01:43,080
you can probably search for it up at the top.

22

00:01:43,080  -->  00:01:48,550
But nevertheless just go with the version that you find first.

23

00:01:48,570  -->  00:01:54,660
For instance if it's the latest one go for that and just click download over here you will need a Microsoft

24

00:01:54,660  -->  00:01:55,020
account.

25

00:01:55,020  -->  00:01:59,550
So if you don't have one already just create an account.

26

00:01:59,610  -->  00:02:01,170
It's very easy to create.

27

00:02:01,170  -->  00:02:03,730
So you can click sign up now.

28

00:02:04,320  -->  00:02:10,400
I'm just going to use my account and here in this download section.

29

00:02:10,560  -->  00:02:13,310
What is very important is for you to select the right version.

30

00:02:13,470  -->  00:02:16,900
So for us we need a SQL Server.

31

00:02:17,010  -->  00:02:19,640
We definitely the management idea.

32

00:02:19,830  -->  00:02:25,600
But if you don't know management studio by itself you will just get the management studio where you

33

00:02:25,600  -->  00:02:29,070
need the database engine as well.

34

00:02:29,070  -->  00:02:32,090
So we're going to go for a skill server.

35

00:02:32,100  -->  00:02:35,600
2014 express with advanced services.

36

00:02:35,790  -->  00:02:41,460
So the name at the time when you're downloading this program might be a bit different or the description

37

00:02:41,460  -->  00:02:42,770
might be different.

38

00:02:42,810  -->  00:02:49,050
In essence what you're looking for is both the database and the management studio and on top of that

39

00:02:49,050  -->  00:02:54,230
there's some additional features that we will be requiring in other sections of course.

40

00:02:54,240  -->  00:03:00,030
So just download the most advanced version and you can find and do make sure that you're downloading

41

00:03:00,030  -->  00:03:02,510
the right one for your type of system.

42

00:03:02,550  -->  00:03:06,860
So how to find out whether you need a 32 or 64 bit studio.

43

00:03:06,870  -->  00:03:08,160
Very easy.

44

00:03:08,200  -->  00:03:14,730
Here's my computer I can if I go and right click on it and I go to properties here you will see that

45

00:03:14,730  -->  00:03:18,510
it tells me that I have a 64 bit operating system.

46

00:03:18,510  -->  00:03:22,770
If yours is 32 then you will need the other version.

47

00:03:22,770  -->  00:03:27,080
So I'm just downloading the 64 bit operating system version.

48

00:03:27,330  -->  00:03:32,510
And in English here just uncheck all these subscriptions.

49

00:03:32,550  -->  00:03:33,560
Click Continue.

50

00:03:33,900  -->  00:03:35,870
And that should start to download.

51

00:03:36,120  -->  00:03:42,750
And bear in mind that this is quite a large file I think it is 1.3 gigabytes it will take quite some

52

00:03:42,750  -->  00:03:51,270
time to download so maybe get yourself a cup of tea and I will fast forward this tutorial and we will

53

00:03:51,270  -->  00:03:54,130
continue once the file is downloaded.

54

00:03:54,570  -->  00:03:57,900
OK so once the file is downloaded it will look like this.

55

00:03:58,140  -->  00:04:03,930
And if you double click it what it will ask you is where it should extract the files.

56

00:04:03,930  -->  00:04:11,130
Here you can specify where you'd like to extract your files and once the files have been extracted then

57

00:04:11,220  -->  00:04:13,920
the installation process will begin.

58

00:04:15,030  -->  00:04:18,420
OK now we're selling us kill server on our computers after this.

59

00:04:18,420  -->  00:04:19,590
A window pops up.

60

00:04:19,590  -->  00:04:25,470
You need to select the first option which is new skills or a standalone installation and that will start

61

00:04:25,470  -->  00:04:30,240
the process of installing a are on to your machine.

62

00:04:30,480  -->  00:04:30,750
OK.

63

00:04:30,750  -->  00:04:33,670
So this is going to be quite a lengthy process.

64

00:04:33,670  -->  00:04:37,060
About half an hour it takes to install SQL Server.

65

00:04:37,060  -->  00:04:38,490
Here you've got the license terms.

66

00:04:38,490  -->  00:04:43,960
Just have a look through them to make sure that you agree for everything and then check the box that

67

00:04:43,970  -->  00:04:45,140
you accept.

68

00:04:45,180  -->  00:04:46,960
Click next here.

69

00:04:47,340  -->  00:04:55,080
Microsoft will conduct a few checks on your computer and then it will proceed to some other menus that

70

00:04:55,080  -->  00:04:59,400
you'll have to also look through the installation process is quite simple.

71

00:04:59,400  -->  00:05:04,200
You don't need to change anything at all as long as you downloaded the correct package everything should

72

00:05:04,200  -->  00:05:06,360
be select pre-selected for you.

73

00:05:06,360  -->  00:05:12,210
I'm just showing you here what everything looks like like for instance local D-B does not have to be

74

00:05:12,210  -->  00:05:12,810
selected.

75

00:05:12,810  -->  00:05:17,970
We won't be needing that in our tutorials in this course.

76

00:05:17,970  -->  00:05:23,370
And so from here you just leave all the default options and you click next to proceed.

77

00:05:23,370  -->  00:05:26,970
And don't forget to change the root of it directly if you like to.

78

00:05:26,970  -->  00:05:29,850
I prefer to keep it the default one.

79

00:05:29,850  -->  00:05:34,640
Once again all options stay as the defaults.

80

00:05:34,710  -->  00:05:40,210
Same thing just keep clicking through here just leave it on Windows Authentication mode.

81

00:05:40,460  -->  00:05:47,010
Select the first option install and configure and then the installation process will begin.

82

00:05:47,010  -->  00:05:51,780
This part of the session process took me about 18 minutes so depending on your machine it might take

83

00:05:52,170  -->  00:05:52,870
a bit longer.

84

00:05:52,870  -->  00:05:54,360
Might go a bit faster.

85

00:05:54,480  -->  00:05:58,170
I won't show you the whole installation process.

86

00:05:58,170  -->  00:06:01,260
I will fast forward through it over here.

87

00:06:01,260  -->  00:06:06,700
There's one thing I did want to mention that when you get to the end of the installation process you

88

00:06:06,700  -->  00:06:09,530
will see that this bar gets to the end.

89

00:06:09,540  -->  00:06:14,070
But that's not actually that and there's still some things that need to be done so be patient.

90

00:06:14,070  -->  00:06:18,870
You will be notified when the installation process is complete and you will see a window which looks

91

00:06:18,870  -->  00:06:20,600
like this.

92

00:06:20,760  -->  00:06:23,400
All right so this is the final window.

93

00:06:23,580  -->  00:06:26,450
You should hopefully see this on your computer as well.

94

00:06:26,670  -->  00:06:33,100
And here it says the status for every single element of the installation every single feature.

95

00:06:33,120  -->  00:06:39,540
So just have a look through them to make sure that everything was installed successfully and after that

96

00:06:39,540  -->  00:06:42,540
you're good to go.

97

00:06:42,540  -->  00:06:47,010
All right now that Asgill server has been successfully installed Let's have a look and see what we can

98

00:06:47,010  -->  00:06:48,170
find it.

99

00:06:48,180  -->  00:06:52,540
You will notice that a desktop I can has not been created for this program.

100

00:06:52,890  -->  00:06:56,430
And in order to find Asgill server we have to go through the start menu.

101

00:06:56,430  -->  00:07:00,500
So I'd like to go to the start menu of your computer and in the Start menu.

102

00:07:00,510  -->  00:07:07,890
Go to all programs and here just scroll down until you find the letter M and M You will see Microsoft

103

00:07:07,910  -->  00:07:09,620
s file server 2014.

104

00:07:09,930  -->  00:07:13,440
And if you open up that folder you will see an icon here.

105

00:07:13,530  -->  00:07:18,800
You'll see many icons but you need the one with the yellow database and the top left corner.

106

00:07:19,080  -->  00:07:23,790
And so which is going to right click it and will select Send to desktop.

107

00:07:23,790  -->  00:07:29,310
Create Shortcut and knowledge's drag this from my other screen onto this screen and there you go.

108

00:07:29,310  -->  00:07:31,740
That's a shortcut for our server.

109

00:07:32,100  -->  00:07:36,460
So we'll just double click it and see what it looks like inside.

110

00:07:36,510  -->  00:07:40,400
It might take a minute to load especially for the first time.

111

00:07:40,470  -->  00:07:41,110
And there you go.

112

00:07:41,130  -->  00:07:47,610
So you can see your server name of course just on server name will be different because it depends on

113

00:07:47,700  -->  00:07:53,670
your computer name and all you have to do here is just click connect and there you go.

114

00:07:53,670  -->  00:08:00,000
So you have connect to the server successfully and you can expand databases here and in the next tutorial

115

00:08:00,030  -->  00:08:05,580
I will show you how to create your own test database.
