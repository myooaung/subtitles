1

00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:00,930
All right.

2

00:00:00,930  -->  00:00:05,670
So our data is imported and now we're going to run our very first linear regression model.

3

00:00:05,670  -->  00:00:07,100
Hope you're excited about this.

4

00:00:07,110  -->  00:00:08,610
Let's get straight into it.

5

00:00:08,610  -->  00:00:15,600
So in Grettel we need to click this menu up at the top model and then we'll just select the ordinary

6

00:00:15,600  -->  00:00:20,240
least squares which is our simple linear regression.

7

00:00:20,280  -->  00:00:25,860
So here we're going to take a salary and we're going to put it into the dependent variable because that's

8

00:00:25,980  -->  00:00:28,410
the variable that we want to predict.

9

00:00:28,620  -->  00:00:32,450
And years of experience we want to put it into the regressors.

10

00:00:32,580  -->  00:00:37,620
So that's going to be the independent variable and we want to see what is the relationship between salary

11

00:00:37,620  -->  00:00:38,570
and experience.

12

00:00:38,820  -->  00:00:45,150
And also here you see that there is a variable here by default which Grinnel puts and therefore is constant

13

00:00:45,160  -->  00:00:45,400
.

14

00:00:45,520  -->  00:00:50,160
It's always going to be there by default and we're going to leave it in there as well.

15

00:00:50,310  -->  00:00:54,850
Okay so we're going to click OK now and voila.

16

00:00:54,900  -->  00:00:57,430
This is the magic screen.

17

00:00:57,450  -->  00:01:03,840
So if you have not seen this before then you should start getting used to it because depending on how

18

00:01:03,840  -->  00:01:09,990
you structure data says carrier you will either see this a lot and all the time or you might see it

19

00:01:09,990  -->  00:01:17,900
occasionally infrequently but you will still eventually have to deal with this report.

20

00:01:17,910  -->  00:01:24,930
And this is actually the result of running your model and this report will be exactly the same wherever

21

00:01:24,930  -->  00:01:30,250
you run your regression whether it's an SAS SPSS are python anywhere.

22

00:01:30,280  -->  00:01:31,700
Their report will look like this.

23

00:01:31,710  -->  00:01:38,550
So let's learn how to read this report and let's learn how to extract the valuable data that we need

24

00:01:38,560  -->  00:01:38,880
.

25

00:01:39,180  -->  00:01:45,120
So at the top you've got the observations that were used the type of regression.

26

00:01:45,150  -->  00:01:49,840
So ordinarily squares in this case then you've got the dependent variable name.

27

00:01:49,870  -->  00:01:52,040
It was salary next.

28

00:01:52,080  -->  00:01:54,320
There's two parts to this part.

29

00:01:54,510  -->  00:02:03,660
And then this part this part is a breakdown of information of statistics per independent variable.

30

00:02:03,660  -->  00:02:08,430
Right now we only have two independent variables so the constant which is actually a variable is just

31

00:02:08,540  -->  00:02:11,970
just a constant and then we've got this independent variable.

32

00:02:11,970  -->  00:02:16,910
Years of experience and then here you've got information which relates to the model overall.

33

00:02:16,920  -->  00:02:18,660
So let's start with the first block.

34

00:02:19,230  -->  00:02:20,440
What are we seeing here.

35

00:02:20,460  -->  00:02:22,530
Well here you see the coefficients.

36

00:02:22,590  -->  00:02:28,230
Those are the coefficients that we discussed in our formula and constant being twenty five thousand

37

00:02:28,230  -->  00:02:35,970
seven hundred ninety two point two dollars means that the line of the linear regression crosses the

38

00:02:35,970  -->  00:02:42,000
vertical axis at twenty five thousand seven hundred ninety two point two which means that if you have

39

00:02:42,000  -->  00:02:49,710
zero years of experience so if this variable is 0 then according to this model your salary should be

40

00:02:49,980  -->  00:02:53,890
twenty five thousand seven hundred ninety two dollars and 20 cents.

41

00:02:53,970  -->  00:02:59,760
And then the coefficient for years of experience is nine thousand four hundred forty nine point ninety

42

00:02:59,760  -->  00:03:00,750
six dollars.

43

00:03:00,750  -->  00:03:01,560
What does that mean.

44

00:03:01,560  -->  00:03:12,860
Well that means that for every one year increase in experience the salary goes up by 9000 $449 and 96

45

00:03:12,900  -->  00:03:14,580
cents in the modeled world.

46

00:03:14,580  -->  00:03:21,030
So not it doesn't necessarily happen like that in real life but from what we've modeled and we'll see

47

00:03:21,030  -->  00:03:23,500
that in a second when we look at the graph.

48

00:03:24,000  -->  00:03:29,070
This is the way things work in the model world with somebody who has three years of experience starts

49

00:03:29,070  -->  00:03:34,350
with this salary and then for every year of experience the salary increases by so much.

50

00:03:34,350  -->  00:03:38,760
And if it's a fraction of year your experience or if it's half a year then it'll be an increase of half

51

00:03:38,760  -->  00:03:39,210
of that.

52

00:03:39,330  -->  00:03:43,200
And that's all in line with the linear regression formula.

53

00:03:43,530  -->  00:03:48,810
Then you've got the standard error here you've got the t ratio and you've got the p values for each

54

00:03:49,140  -->  00:03:57,130
of your constant or variables in this section or in this part of the course will be folks of course

55

00:03:57,130  -->  00:04:02,130
these are all important and it depends on what you're doing with your data science project you might

56

00:04:02,220  -->  00:04:03,570
you might need to work with these.

57

00:04:03,570  -->  00:04:09,900
But in this particular part of of course we're going to be talking about the P-value is mostly why well

58

00:04:09,900  -->  00:04:17,280
that's because the p values allow us to understand the statistical significance of individual variables

59

00:04:17,370  -->  00:04:22,440
and we will be focusing this on this quite a lot in the further sections of this part of the Course

60

00:04:22,440  -->  00:04:29,090
because it will allow us to filter out variables that are not actually predicting anything.

61

00:04:29,100  -->  00:04:31,190
So I'll give you an example here.

62

00:04:31,290  -->  00:04:37,340
Right now the P-value is very very small so it's a one fourteen looks quite a lot.

63

00:04:37,350  -->  00:04:44,490
But then you've got multiply this this over here is a scientific term for 10 to the power of minus 20

64

00:04:44,510  -->  00:04:44,710
.

65

00:04:44,880  -->  00:04:51,150
So that's you've got to multiply one point fourteen times ten to the power minus 20 which makes it a

66

00:04:51,270  -->  00:04:54,060
very very small value tiny value.

67

00:04:54,280  -->  00:04:59,400
And well that is a good thing the smaller the P-value the better.

68

00:04:59,550  -->  00:05:02,960
That means that this variable actually predicts something.

69

00:05:02,970  -->  00:05:09,490
So if you had a P-value which is great which is quite high for instance even higher than 0.05.

70

00:05:09,540  -->  00:05:17,190
So in percentage terms higher than 5 percent that is already considered of a high P-value.

71

00:05:17,190  -->  00:05:24,930
And what what it's saying is that when you change the independent variable it won't actually be associated

72

00:05:24,930  -->  00:05:27,660
with any change in the dependent variable.

73

00:05:27,690  -->  00:05:33,210
So you can only you got to pick and we'll talk about this further in this part of the course and the

74

00:05:33,210  -->  00:05:34,470
modeling part of the course.

75

00:05:34,470  -->  00:05:37,020
But you've got to pick a threshold for your P-value.

76

00:05:37,020  -->  00:05:43,650
So for instance if you stick to 5 percent which is probably the most used p value or the conventional

77

00:05:43,650  -->  00:05:49,200
P-value threshold then if your P-value is above 0.05.

78

00:05:49,200  -->  00:05:55,980
So if here is above 0.05 and there's no multiplying by 10 to a very negative number then that means

79

00:05:55,980  -->  00:06:02,850
that your p values about 5 percent and that means that the relationship between these two variable salary

80

00:06:02,850  -->  00:06:05,510
and the years of experience isn't statistically significant.

81

00:06:05,530  -->  00:06:13,350
And so basically your model in layman's terms it's not actually working so this variable is not predicting

82

00:06:13,350  -->  00:06:14,280
anything.

83

00:06:14,280  -->  00:06:18,620
So that's how you read this part of the report.

84

00:06:18,630  -->  00:06:20,830
Let's move on to the second part.

85

00:06:21,090  -->  00:06:23,820
So here you've got some stats about the model overall.

86

00:06:24,120  -->  00:06:29,610
And the ones that will be focusing on in this course that are most important to us are the R-squared

87

00:06:30,130  -->  00:06:32,760
way here and the adjusted R-squared.

88

00:06:32,970  -->  00:06:38,790
And we've already spoken about these two parameters back in the previous section were talking about

89

00:06:39,060  -->  00:06:40,770
refreshing our stats knowledge.

90

00:06:40,890  -->  00:06:45,870
So we will see how we're going to be using them further in the course especially when we're building

91

00:06:45,900  -->  00:06:48,120
our customer segmentation model further on
