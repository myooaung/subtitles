Is

2

00:00:07.500  -->  00:00:12.180
welcome to this part of the course on communication and presentation in this section I'll be sharing

3

00:00:12.210  -->  00:00:15.710
with you my experiences of being a data center.

4

00:00:15.960  -->  00:00:22.470
So I'll tell you about how I communicate with people how I would across different departments what I

5

00:00:22.470  -->  00:00:28.290
think of when you how you need to say no to people I'll give you my tips and hacks I'm presenting I'll

6

00:00:28.290  -->  00:00:34.500
give you case studies and it all be coming from experience so I would like to make sure that we're on

7

00:00:34.500  -->  00:00:40.950
the same page here that these things are going to be talking about are basically what I have been through

8

00:00:40.960  -->  00:00:41.400
.

9

00:00:41.550  -->  00:00:46.650
They're not hard written facts or they're not set in stone rules.

10

00:00:46.740  -->  00:00:51.370
But basically the way I see things my philosophy around science.

11

00:00:51.390  -->  00:00:57.060
So how many take them with a grain of salt maybe just to be cautious of that.

12

00:00:57.080  -->  00:00:58.730
That's your experiences.

13

00:00:58.890  -->  00:01:00.350
Eventually might be different.

14

00:01:00.720  -->  00:01:05.220
But I thought it'd be fun to share what I've been through as a scientist.

15

00:01:05.350  -->  00:01:10.140
And another thing is that we're just going to have a casual style Territorials because these are not

16

00:01:10.680  -->  00:01:11.830
technical or anything.

17

00:01:11.880  -->  00:01:17.700
We're going to take a break from being very technical with all the tools that we learned and all the

18

00:01:17.700  -->  00:01:19.730
skill that we've really picked up in this course.

19

00:01:19.770  -->  00:01:26.410
So we're just going to sit back and chat like this and I'll I'll show some my experiences here.

20

00:01:26.430  -->  00:01:31.210
So grab a coffee grab grab a cup of tea and let's kick this off.
