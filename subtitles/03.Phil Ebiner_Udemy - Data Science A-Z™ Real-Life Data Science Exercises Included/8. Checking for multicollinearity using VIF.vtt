00:00:00.990  -->  00:00:07.560
Ok so today we're talking about multicollinearity effects as I recall last time we created a new variable

2

00:00:07.560  -->  00:00:13.740
which is a wealth accumulation which basically equals balance divided by age and we include in our model

3

00:00:14.080  -->  00:00:19.390
and all we can see right away is that it doesn't have any significance.

4

00:00:19.650  -->  00:00:25.980
However that sometimes can happen when you have multicollinearity in your independent variables and

5

00:00:25.980  -->  00:00:31.380
what that means is that they're correlated and therefore as we know it's not a good thing when you're

6

00:00:31.650  -->  00:00:33.440
independent variables are correlated.

7

00:00:33.600  -->  00:00:35.790
It can cause a moral to break.

8

00:00:35.790  -->  00:00:42.600
So wealth accumulation balance and age or in this case log balance are all linked because wealth commission

9

00:00:42.610  -->  00:00:44.860
is basically balance divided by age.

10

00:00:44.880  -->  00:00:49.460
So how do we check if there is any multicollinearity present in our model.

11

00:00:49.740  -->  00:00:57.270
Well there's a very simple step first step which is to use the variance inflation factors and to get

12

00:00:57.270  -->  00:01:02.420
to that in Grendal you just have to go to a moral Klik test and click on coaling charity.

13

00:01:02.940  -->  00:01:05.720
And as you can see here we've got a new screen that popped up.

14

00:01:05.850  -->  00:01:14.070
It's got Varians inflation factors and it's got some basic information for you here right away.

15

00:01:14.070  -->  00:01:19.510
Minimum possible values 1 values over 10 may indicate culinarily peculiarity problem.

16

00:01:19.530  -->  00:01:26.070
So here you can see that lawk balance and wealth accumulation actually have a 5.8 and 5.7.

17

00:01:26.070  -->  00:01:33.420
Now that's not over 10 but that's already greater than the rest of the variable so it's indicating that

18

00:01:33.420  -->  00:01:34.930
something might be going on.

19

00:01:35.280  -->  00:01:41.940
So what else we can do right now is we can't rerun this model but we'll take a look balance out and

20

00:01:41.940  -->  00:01:44.220
see what happens to wealth accumulation.

21

00:01:44.220  -->  00:01:50.430
Let's go to a model limited logic binary and I'm going to take simply take wealth accumulation out of

22

00:01:50.430  -->  00:01:55.070
the mall load balance out of the model and rerun it like that.

23

00:01:55.080  -->  00:01:58.000
So I'm I'm running out of space here.

24

00:01:58.080  -->  00:02:01.750
I'll put it down here so we're comparing this to this.

25

00:02:01.800  -->  00:02:04.800
Here you can see that welfare Commission doesn't have any significance.

26

00:02:05.010  -->  00:02:09.890
Here you can see right away it became very significant and it even changed its sign.

27

00:02:10.230  -->  00:02:13.590
So that is always interesting here.

28

00:02:13.590  -->  00:02:16.720
You remember a lot of balance was positive.

29

00:02:16.770  -->  00:02:22.290
The greater the somebodies balance the more likely they are to leave here low balance was positive as

30

00:02:22.290  -->  00:02:22.840
well.

31

00:02:22.890  -->  00:02:26.680
And the coefficient increased wealth accumulation had a negative side.

32

00:02:27.030  -->  00:02:29.760
And but it was insignificant we didn't care about the sign.

33

00:02:29.910  -->  00:02:33.700
But now it became significant and it has a positive sign.

34

00:02:34.260  -->  00:02:39.930
That is a good indication that perhaps what is happening is that load balance and willful accumulation

35

00:02:39.930  -->  00:02:45.000
because their current correlated the regression model was giving them opposite signs so that they would

36

00:02:45.000  -->  00:02:46.050
negate each other out.

37

00:02:46.050  -->  00:02:52.530
And don't forget that this is actually attempts tend to power minus 5 so while doesn't doesn't really

38

00:02:53.130  -->  00:02:54.680
affect our conclusion.

39

00:02:54.690  -->  00:03:00.470
But anyway so there is a chance that because they're correlated they're getting different sides.

40

00:03:00.470  -->  00:03:05.910
And since you had one of them this one got her an opposite side that switched its side and also became

41

00:03:05.910  -->  00:03:06.410
significant.

42

00:03:06.410  -->  00:03:10.840
That's a good indication that there is some sort of correlation for go to tests again and go to school

43

00:03:10.850  -->  00:03:11.830
in yesterday.

44

00:03:11.970  -->  00:03:15.030
Now you see that everything is below two.

45

00:03:15.040  -->  00:03:18.590
So it's a wealth accumulation drop that already.

46

00:03:18.810  -->  00:03:19.150
OK.

47

00:03:19.170  -->  00:03:20.440
That's interesting.

48

00:03:20.940  -->  00:03:28.560
So what we can do now is in order to explore the effects of culinarily even in more detail what it will

49

00:03:28.560  -->  00:03:33.420
do is will create another variable so for now I'm just going to put all of these here you can see how

50

00:03:33.420  -->  00:03:36.900
it's growing very steadily is growing.

51

00:03:37.320  -->  00:03:44.390
And we'll talk about this more later about you know manually creating models in the summer for the section

52

00:03:44.400  -->  00:03:44.650
.

53

00:03:45.000  -->  00:03:53.130
But as you can see we're doing a lot of work and a lot of thinking and we are using business knowledge

54

00:03:53.130  -->  00:03:59.220
to make corrections to the model and things like that so something a machine can't really do.

55

00:03:59.520  -->  00:04:00.590
Not at this stage anyway.

56

00:04:00.600  -->  00:04:03.170
So that is important.

57

00:04:03.180  -->  00:04:10.500
I just want you to remember this picture mentally when we talk about models the way we created the model

58

00:04:10.500  -->  00:04:12.400
in the summary for this section.

59

00:04:12.410  -->  00:04:16.240
Anyway moving back to what we're doing now is creating a new variable.

60

00:04:16.440  -->  00:04:20.690
Let's create a variable which is a log of your wealth accumulation.

61

00:04:21.060  -->  00:04:28.770
Define your variable log underscore w a for wealth accumulation equals.

62

00:04:28.770  -->  00:04:35.230
So be the same log 10 balance divided by age plus 1.

63

00:04:35.250  -->  00:04:37.160
Because balance can be zero.

64

00:04:37.350  -->  00:04:38.500
Looks good.

65

00:04:38.610  -->  00:04:39.030
All right.

66

00:04:39.040  -->  00:04:39.530
There it is.

67

00:04:39.530  -->  00:04:48.330
So now what we want to do is how about we include this variable along with Flugge balance just like

68

00:04:48.330  -->  00:04:51.170
we had here we had low balance and wealth accumulation.

69

00:04:51.210  -->  00:04:52.080
How what.

70

00:04:52.140  -->  00:04:57.990
Just to amplify the effect and the possible effect of correlation will include these two because they're

71

00:04:57.990  -->  00:05:03.150
more similar than wealth and LUGG balance these two are way more civil and that way we'll be able to

72

00:05:03.150  -->  00:05:06.210
explore correlation a bit better.

73

00:05:06.210  -->  00:05:12.570
So let's go to logit binary and we'll take on wealth accumulation and instead we'll include

74

00:05:15.380  -->  00:05:20.910
load balance and log wealth accumulation and we'll click OK.

75

00:05:20.910  -->  00:05:25.910
And now let's look at what we have here.

76

00:05:26.010  -->  00:05:31.620
So here you can see that both loved baluns and LOEG wealth accumulation is significant.

77

00:05:31.620  -->  00:05:33.480
Very interesting observation right.

78

00:05:33.520  -->  00:05:41.520
So they're both significant variables they both have a impact or have association with the independent

79

00:05:41.520  -->  00:05:43.720
variable a dependent variable which is exited.

80

00:05:44.040  -->  00:05:46.930
However again you can see that they have different opposite sides right.

81

00:05:46.950  -->  00:05:49.920
So one is improving.

82

00:05:49.920  -->  00:05:54.060
So one is actually means that people are more likely to exit.

83

00:05:54.060  -->  00:05:55.620
One is saying less likely.

84

00:05:55.620  -->  00:06:00.760
Another thing that you might want to notice is that back here log balance had a positive sign.

85

00:06:00.780  -->  00:06:03.970
Now it has or it has and still has a positive side.

86

00:06:03.990  -->  00:06:06.780
So LUGG wealth accumulation though has a negative sign.

87

00:06:06.780  -->  00:06:11.750
So here wealth accumulation had a positive sign here LOEG wealth accumulation is a negative sign.

88

00:06:12.090  -->  00:06:16.760
Let's go ahead and check for our.

89

00:06:17.490  -->  00:06:20.170
What are we checking for Colin Geraghty over here.

90

00:06:20.190  -->  00:06:27.580
So here you can see that the vivs for load balance and Log W.A. through the roof they're not just overturned

91

00:06:27.600  -->  00:06:27.630
.

92

00:06:27.660  -->  00:06:28.910
They're well over 10.

93

00:06:28.930  -->  00:06:30.970
They're 700 plus.

94

00:06:31.200  -->  00:06:38.940
So that is the model screaming at you saying that you have included two variables that are basically

95

00:06:38.940  -->  00:06:39.880
the same thing.

96

00:06:40.080  -->  00:06:44.130
And this is a very very bad for the model.

97

00:06:44.130  -->  00:06:46.410
It's pretty much breaking it.

98

00:06:46.410  -->  00:06:51.090
So we want to definitely exclude one of them when you see something like that you need to exclude one

99

00:06:51.090  -->  00:06:53.580
of the variables.

100

00:06:53.820  -->  00:07:01.740
And in this case we're going to exclude alog W.A. because in our scenario low balances I believe better

101

00:07:01.920  -->  00:07:03.080
but we can still explore.

102

00:07:03.120  -->  00:07:09.780
So if we want to understand which I don't want to exclude How about we just take LUGG balance out leave

103

00:07:09.830  -->  00:07:16.120
log W.A. and now I go to this model which had bought which had LOEG balance.

104

00:07:16.140  -->  00:07:21.170
No the one that that didn't have w at all so this model right.

105

00:07:21.330  -->  00:07:23.290
And here we can just compare the two.

106

00:07:23.310  -->  00:07:31.450
This one had 1 5 1 0 6 and this one is 1 5 0 8 7 so our Square went down when we place look balanced

107

00:07:31.450  -->  00:07:36.700
with love W.A. and just so what does accuracy do.

108

00:07:36.870  -->  00:07:42.690
Well increases a little bit but in this case so there's no point in replacing balance with a more complex

109

00:07:42.690  -->  00:07:43.130
variable.

110

00:07:43.140  -->  00:07:44.770
We'll just keep balance.

111

00:07:44.820  -->  00:07:47.220
So there you go.

112

00:07:47.370  -->  00:07:48.720
Put this one here.

113

00:07:48.870  -->  00:07:52.740
Dangerously running out of space.

114

00:07:52.740  -->  00:07:53.830
All right.

115

00:07:53.850  -->  00:08:07.560
Whereas my model so low that we're out lock balance in that's checking for multicollinearity using the

116

00:08:07.690  -->  00:08:08.360
VIF
