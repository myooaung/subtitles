00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.680
Congratulations on completing the course.

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.120
If you followed all of the steps you should be now Google and certified and have that tangible evidence

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.760
of your analytic skills on your resume if you haven't taken all the steps yet I really encourage you

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.660
to go ahead and do it because it will enable you to get a high paying job.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.750
When freelancing clients and readers understand how to use Google Analytics is a powerful tool to grow

6
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.910
a business.

7
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.800
So thank you for your attention and congratulations.

8
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.100
And I also have one final request.

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.200
I would really appreciate it if you would leave a course review if you are certified you can say that

10
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.520
in the review.

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.390
And that really is important for me to see the students are getting the results and of course it's extremely

12
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.840
motivating to me but also it maybe even more importantly it's really encouraging to other students who

13
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.660
are thinking of enrolling and if they see that they can gain real skills that can get them a job and

14
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.880
tangible results and they see other people are doing it they're really going to take the course and

15
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.590
follow the process as well.

16
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:11.790
So for my motivation and for other students as motivation is well please the course review and say if

17
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.920
you got certified.

18
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.220
So thank you very much and thank you for attention and I hope to see you soon.

19
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.430
One of my other courses.
