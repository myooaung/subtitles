00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.220
In this video I'm going to show you five different ways to promote your Google Analytics certification

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.020
so you can get a job earn more and when freelancing clients.

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.800
So the first thing you need to do is get your certification and you do that.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.850
You can log into your academy for Radzik and come up to the right hand corner click on my profile and

5
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.240
here you should see all the certifications that you have.

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.540
So you can just click into the Google Analytics certification and the first way to really promoted is

7
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.610
just to print it out and put it on your desk so you can click on the print button here and then you

8
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.820
can print that I'd put that on your wall in a frame.

9
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.040
You can put that on your credit cubicle desk to really show your colleagues in your team members that

10
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.100
you have this qualification and that really can get you lined up for more responsibility within the

11
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.900
team or even a promotion.

12
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.470
So printing it out is the first way that you can promote it.

13
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.010
Now what you can also do at this stage is maybe open it up in a PTF.

14
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.570
If you see that option there and just download this to your desktop that's going to be important for

15
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.750
some of the other ways that we want to promote this.

16
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.650
I'm just going to move this to my desktop and save it there for one of the other ways we're going to

17
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.500
promote it.

18
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.290
So the next way that you can promote it is really just to add it to your CV.

19
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.000
So if you don't have a resume or CV there is a great template you can come into Google Docs just type

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.860
that into google quick into Google Docs and then you can see that they have some templates here so you

21
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.890
can click open the template gallery on one resume template that I think looks particularly good.

22
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:53.880
Is this resume called Spearman's and what she can do then is just an under awards you can add in Google

23
00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.770
Analytics certification and put in your date or whatever that is 18.

24
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.400
So that is the second way you can promote it just by simply adding it to your CV.

25
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.990
That's going to look great if you're applying for jobs that can really see that you have these skills.

26
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.670
Now another way that you can promote it is by adding it to your LinkedIn profile.

27
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.440
So just log into your linked in a case then you want to scroll down.

28
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.200
And what we want to do is grow and this section here where it says certifications are accomplishments

29
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.240
so we can just click that certification what you want to do is just type in the certification name so

30
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.430
Google Analytics

31
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.330
certification now your certification authority or certification authorities are going to be Google.

32
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.600
So putting Google dot com the license number you're going to see this on your certification.

33
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.340
Let me just pull my one up here.

34
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.650
So you can see you have an I.D. here.

35
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.160
So copy that and paste that in there.

36
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.180
Mayor also going to have to look at this again just to put in the FROM days on the expiry date.

37
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:32.420
So for me it's from from August 2009 teen to August 2000 or 90 and then all we have to do is click save

38
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.520
and you can see here.

39
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.960
This is the one here.

40
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.710
Now we have the certification at it.

41
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.090
Now you'll notice that there isn't a link to the certification here like I've done and these are the

42
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.780
ones.

43
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.420
So what I can do is show you how to really get a link to those certifications as well that just gives

44
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.630
that extra level of credibility.

45
00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.070
So if you want to get a link to it you Hoxha after you actually save it maybe on your own google drive

46
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.540
so you can come into Google Drive or Dropbox or anything like that just set up a little folder for your

47
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.680
Google certification and then what you can do is upload the file that you've just downloaded to your

48
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.380
desktop add it in there and then what we're going to do is just get the link from this.

49
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.190
So I've uploaded this to my own personal google drive.

50
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.270
I'm going to share this.

51
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:36.170
Just create a link that everybody can view create my share sharable link copy that come back into Linked-In

52
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.180
and the certification is set up.

53
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.520
Then the bottom here you can see the option to add in the certification you are l.

54
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:52.360
Now the advantage of doing that is just that people can click through and see your certification.

55
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.110
And that's really just adds another level of credibility.

56
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.920
Now by adding it to say a Google Drive like this or Dropbox or whatever you're using you couldn't really

57
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:12.260
then add this link to any freelancing platform whether you're a pro fallen work or five or dot.com or

58
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.460
anything like that.

59
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.440
You can just copy and paste this link in just like we've done there so people can really click through

60
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.650
and see your credibility.

61
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.990
So that was really the third way.

62
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.010
By just adding it to LinkedIn under accomplishments and certifications.

63
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.690
So now let's look at the final way that you can promote it and it's on Linked-In again.

64
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:41.330
So if you come in and click on home you're going to see this option to create a post and what you can

65
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.730
do here is really say something like.

66
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.290
And you can even say thanks to me.

67
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.530
Thanks to our

68
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.240
Deborah Walsh you should see this pop up.

69
00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:08.370
And I'm the Google Analytics certified and what this is going to do is really send this message to all

70
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:15.060
of your contacts on LinkedIn that will really inform them that you're know you now have tangible evidence

71
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.620
of your analytics skills and if there's any jobs that they're aware of and they can reach out and get

72
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:27.300
you it's a great way just to start conversation about getting a job or earning that promotion or freelancing

73
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.430
clients need to make this even better.

74
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.310
What you can do is upload an image.

75
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:40.500
So what you need to do is really get that PTF that you've downloaded and now convert this to a jpeg

76
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.700
or an image file because you can actually upload a PTF to LinkedIn.

77
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.350
So what you can do is open this up and it might be slightly different on your computer.

78
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.280
But I'm going to export this and change this to a jpeg.

79
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.740
And this is just going to go back to my desktop and now I have a jpeg or an image file version of this

80
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.620
PDA.

81
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.520
Now I have a Mac so the process might be slightly different for you but if you have any trouble with

82
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.940
this what you can do is type into Google convert PTF T.J. Baig.

83
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.900
There's a load of free services that you can do this with.

84
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.010
So very very simple.

85
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.110
And then what you want to do is just copy that image.

86
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.730
You can see icons on the PDA.

87
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.580
That's why it changes.

88
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:36.360
Open that up and then that's going to be part of the post that you send to all of your contacts on LinkedIn

89
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.230
really letting them know that you are now Google on it's certified.

90
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.480
So post that then that's all you do.

91
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.260
And that'll go to all of your contacts.

92
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.060
So those are five ideas to promote your Google Analytics certification number one was printed I put

93
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.780
it on your desk.

94
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.250
Number two is added to your resume resume.

95
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.940
Number three was adding it to your LinkedIn profile.

96
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.630
Number four was promoting it not linked in like this.

97
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:08.350
Number five was getting that link on Google Drive and adding it to all the freelancing platforms.

98
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.640
So go ahead and implement those.

99
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:17.420
So you can get a high paying job get freelancing clients and earn that promotion.

100
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.440
So go ahead and try those that.
