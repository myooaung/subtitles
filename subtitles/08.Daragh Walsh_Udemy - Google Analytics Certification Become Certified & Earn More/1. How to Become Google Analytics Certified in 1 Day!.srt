about Google Analytics and I've really designed this course so you can get that certificate in the shortest
12

13
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,340
amount of time possible and I really designed this for you to get it in one day.
13

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,070
And here is how you're going to do it.
14

15
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,320
So first you're going to access some key Google Analytics resources.
15

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,840
Second you're just going to watch the Google training for beginner.
16

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,240
I prepared this myself.
17

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,250
The slides are available for download.
18

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,840
It's extremely detailed.
19

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,570
We cover a lot in just 60 minutes.
20

21
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,730
Then you can watch the Advanced Google and training that I prepared for you in just 45 minutes.
21

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,370
And then you can take the practice test which is really based on the questions in the real exams.
22

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,570
This is incredible preparation.
23

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,710
And then you create your academy for ads account. Just takes five minutes.
24

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,640
This is where you take the exam and then take the official exam another hour and a half and then I'm going to show
25

26
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:44,250
you how to add the certification to your resume linked in profile and freelancing sites so you can really get those
26

27
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,280
high paying jobs.
27

28
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,810
And win those freelancing clients.
28

29
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,370
So in total it's actually much less than a day to become certified It's just five hours you can do this.
29

30
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,890
Right now go straight through and do it all.
30

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:02,580
And it's a really a tangible profound result in a short amount of time and the process really does work.
31

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,130
You can easily become certified just like these students here.
32

33
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,460

35

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,260
So there is nothing holding you back from becoming a Google certified professional.
36

37
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,220
You don't need to be part of a company to take the exam.
37

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,340
You don't need to have any on the job experience and you don't even need to spend a penny to take the
38

39
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,740
