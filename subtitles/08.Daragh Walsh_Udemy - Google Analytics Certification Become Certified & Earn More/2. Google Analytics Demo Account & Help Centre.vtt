00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.600
There are two free must have Google Analytics resources that I recommend you get access to straight
1

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.110
away.
2

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.380
And the first is the Google Analytics demo account.
3

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.620
Now this is a fully functioning Google Analytics account.
4

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.630
All of the data actually comes from a Real's Web site which is the Google merchandise store where they
5

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.810
sell merchandise for Google hats T-shirts that type of thing.
6

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.370
So this is real data.
7

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.480
And by getting access to this account you can really get hands on practical experience with Google analytics
8

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.510
that you can bring into a job or use before you start to work for a client etc.
9

10
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.360
Now even if you do have a web site I'd still recommend you add this to your Google Analytics account
10

11
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.860
because they have a lot of advanced configurations set up like custom dimensions and metrics filters
11

12
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.800
goals and so by coming in looking at this you really have a guide that you can look at and it's a real
12

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.810
working account.
13

14
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.500
So what I'm going to do is put this link in the description of the video.
14

15
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.790
You just need to click access demo can't.
15

16
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.260
It'll prompt you to set up a Google Analytics account if you don't have one.
16

17
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.130
And if you do have one you can just add this in and have it alongside all of your other Google Analytics
17

18
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.860
properties.
18

19
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:25.430
So fantastic I must have to get that practical hands on experience working with a real account.
19

20
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.690
It will save you from setting up a Web site and having to implement the tracking code and all that stuff.
20

21
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.090
Now the second resource is the Google Analytics help center and this is incredible.
21

22
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.330
I referred this all the time.
22

23
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.430
There's a lot of sections broken down here for help and you can also just type anything in if there's
23

24
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.360
a metric like the bounce rate that you don't understand what that is when you're looking and report
24

25
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.810
just come in and find it.
25

26
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.830
So those are the two resources that demo account and the help center. I put the links in the description
26

27
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.480
and the key thing that you should know is that you can not only use these to better prepare for the
27

28
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.180
exam but you can actually use these during the Google Analytics certification exam as well.
28

29
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.460
Not a lot of people know that the Google and certification exam is an open book policy.
29

30
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.770
So if you get stuck you can come in here look at the specific reports and try and figure out what the
30

31
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.680
question is about or Type in you know some of the keywords from the question in here and you'll be
31

32
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.280
able to really help you use this to help you answer those tougher questions and pass the exam first
32

33
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.700
time.
33

34
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.170
So links are in the description.
34

35
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.260
Go ahead and get access to them right now.
