00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
In this lesson, we'll be talking about sections and snippets.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.020
Snippets is quite basic and easy to understand.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.435
Basically, if we put code into a snippet,

4
00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:12.540
we can include it in multiple places in our theme.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.865
It allows us to reuse code,

6
00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:17.310
but also to organize our code better.

7
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.370
Sections on the other hand are a little bit more intelligent and

8
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.165
we'll see why that is in this lesson.

9
00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:27.225
If we go back to our theme.

10
00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:33.335
liquid layout, we can see a really obvious need for a section here.

11
00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:38.055
That is, we've got all this header content inside our layout.

12
00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:44.570
Now what you would usually do in a Shopify theme is have a header and footer section.

13
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.250
What I'm going to do is I'm going to cut all of this so that's in my clipboard.

14
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.045
I don't want to lose it, and then I'm going to replace that with a call to a section.

15
00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:58.870
Going to write section header.

16
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.415
Now when I hit save,

17
00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:04.520
it's going to link to that section which we haven't created yet.

18
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.125
We're going to go in,

19
00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:10.290
create a section with the same name, header.

20
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.520
The editor will automatically add the extension of dot liquid for us,

21
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.570
so we don't need to do that,

22
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.615
and it also automatically adds in a schema,

23
00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:25.195
style sheet and JavaScript tags, very handy.

24
00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:30.290
Okay, we'll get into schemas in depth in the next lesson but for now,

25
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.005
what I'm going to do is paste that liquid and HTML code directly into here.

26
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:39.949
If I hit save, refresh

27
00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:44.075
any page because every page in a theme right now uses the same layout,

28
00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:46.610
we'll see that nothing's changed, okay?

29
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.805
Actually something has changed,

30
00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:57.380
and that is that we have now got all of this encapsulated in a Shopify generated div tag.

31
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.665
It gives it an ID of Shopify section dash,

32
00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:03.475
and then the name of the section.

33
00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:07.115
It also gives it a class of Shopify section.

34
00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:09.575
Let's create another section,

35
00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:13.130
and let's call it footer.

36
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.235
After the main content,

37
00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:21.050
we usually have a footer and we can put that into its own section.

38
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.740
If I save that, it will link to a footer that doesn't exist yet,

39
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.790
so we need to create it.

40
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.010
I'll create this footer.liquid file in my sections.

41
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.345
I will go up here and let's just open up a footer tag.

42
00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:39.380
Close the footer tag,

43
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.630
and maybe just put some copyright information there copyright, Christopher Dodd.

44
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.670
There's one thing I'v forgotten to do and that's to

45
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.385
actually name the section in the schema.

46
00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:52.405
We want to change this to footer,

47
00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:54.470
and then in our header,

48
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.485
we want the section name to be header.

49
00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:00.850
This is what's going to show up in the customizer.

50
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.320
As I said, we'll go more into schemas,

51
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.380
but basically all of this is for the customizer.

52
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.545
If I go back into any page because they all use the same layout,

53
00:03:12.545 --> 00:03:16.700
we can see that we've got a similar tag generated for the footer as well.

54
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.080
Shopify dash, section, dash and the name of the section which is footer,

55
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.175
and of course the class Shopify section.

56
00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:25.700
Now you can see down here,

57
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.425
it's not nicely formatted,

58
00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:33.230
but inside you've got the footer tag with copyright Christopher Dodd.

59
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.130
Now what I want to show you is how that looks in the customizer.

60
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.120
This is a good visual representation of what's going on here.

61
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.540
All I did there was I right-clicked on

62
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.425
customize theme to go to the customizer for this theme.

63
00:03:48.425 --> 00:03:53.300
Now you'll see on the homepage we have header and footer.

64
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.885
These are the sections as they appear enact theme customizer.

65
00:03:57.885 --> 00:04:01.175
If we go to any page, any template,

66
00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:03.740
because we are using the same layout file,

67
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.575
we'll get header and footer on every page.

68
00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:08.710
Go back to the homepage.

69
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:15.860
I'm actually going to remove footer from our theme.liquid file.

70
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.220
Just to show you how that would show up in the customizer.

71
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.990
If I go to the customizer,

72
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.305
refresh the page, then we only see the header.

73
00:04:25.305 --> 00:04:28.400
This is something I covered in the last class

74
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.000
so that should be just a recap for most of you.

75
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.685
But as you can see what this really bear theme,

76
00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:39.255
we have created all the sections that exist in this theme.

77
00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:41.435
If we go to any other page,

78
00:04:41.435 --> 00:04:46.975
there is no section in-between header and footer for this theme yet.

79
00:04:46.975 --> 00:04:49.085
If we go to theme settings,

80
00:04:49.085 --> 00:04:55.190
we only have the default checkout list of customizations here.

81
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.380
We can add to this as well.

82
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.945
Here you can see the official version of this.

83
00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:01.895
It's the theme kit, template theme.

84
00:05:01.895 --> 00:05:06.535
Again, this is just the one you get by running theme new in theme kit.

85
00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:09.335
Alright, so to create our next section,

86
00:05:09.335 --> 00:05:11.210
one thing we can modify,

87
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.765
and this is something that is quite common is to take

88
00:05:14.765 --> 00:05:18.500
all the code within a template and move that into a section.

89
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.465
Now that might sound a bit weird at first,

90
00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:22.700
but we'll explain why that is in just a second.

91
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:30.595
I'm going to call this section collection template because that's essentially what it is.

92
00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:36.105
Then I'm going to create that section.

93
00:05:36.105 --> 00:05:38.835
Now and here we've got a schema,

94
00:05:38.835 --> 00:05:43.880
and I'm just going to paste the exact same code we had in our collection template.

95
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.320
I'm going to call this collection template in the actual schema.

96
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.605
That is the name that'll show up in the customizer.

97
00:05:51.605 --> 00:05:55.650
If we go to our collection page,

98
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.480
now we'll see collection template,

99
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.740
which is the name we defined in the schema to be a section in here.

100
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.340
As you notice, because we have no settings in our schema,

101
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.850
it says here no content or settings.

102
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.655
We can actually customize this.

103
00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:16.115
The reason why we would have

104
00:06:16.115 --> 00:06:20.450
an basically an empty collection template file and link

105
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.130
straight to a section with all the code for that template there,

106
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.290
is because we can now customize it using the customizer.

107
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.745
If we just left that code here,

108
00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:34.580
it would sit outside of a section and then we wouldn't have

109
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.745
access to a schema for which we can edit with.

110
00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:41.480
That's not necessarily true in the sense that there

111
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.010
is a settings schema for the theme as a whole,

112
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.990
but we want to section the settings for this particular template.

113
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.420
We want to move it into its own section.

114
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.670
Okay, right now we haven't really done anything because we haven't set any settings.

115
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:04.520
Maybe I want to create a setting here and we do that in the settings object.

116
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.975
What's something I might want to customize as the user about this page.

117
00:07:08.975 --> 00:07:12.780
Well, maybe I want to control the pagination.

118
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.180
Remember when I say user,

119
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.595
I'm talking about the shop admin who's using this customizer in this case.

120
00:07:19.595 --> 00:07:21.755
Maybe I want to control the pagination.

121
00:07:21.755 --> 00:07:25.795
What I'm going to do is open up an object,

122
00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:29.735
and inside this object I'm going to be writing,

123
00:07:29.735 --> 00:07:31.640
this is all JSON format by the way,

124
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.510
so we're going to be opening up a double quote,

125
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.185
and what we need to do here is insert an input.

126
00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:46.800
The place you can learn more about that is if we just Google Shopify input settings.

127
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.965
I believe it's in configuring theme settings right here.

128
00:07:50.965 --> 00:07:55.705
If I search for input settings,

129
00:07:55.705 --> 00:07:58.900
here we can see the basic input settings.

130
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.565
Text for instance, this is the input setting that we would put in.

131
00:08:03.565 --> 00:08:07.240
We can also put in like an image picker,

132
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.970
we can put in a set of radio buttons,

133
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.555
a dropdown, all things, checkbox.

134
00:08:13.555 --> 00:08:18.280
For pagination, I think it makes sense to use a range slider.

135
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.945
It'll show up like this.

136
00:08:19.945 --> 00:08:22.660
The reason why a range slider would be good in this instance,

137
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.595
is because we want to restrict the user's input to something reasonable.

138
00:08:27.595 --> 00:08:30.745
We don't want to paginate any less than say two,

139
00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:34.780
and we don't want to paginate any more than say 25.

140
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.330
Otherwise, it'll take too long to load the page.

141
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.320
What we can do is we can copy this example right here,

142
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.910
go back into our code.

143
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.950
Which tab was that? Okay, here we go.

144
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.185
Rather than writing this word for word,

145
00:08:47.185 --> 00:08:49.525
I'm just going to copy and paste it in.

146
00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:54.625
Now we have got an object which represents our setting.

147
00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:56.950
The first thing we need is the type,

148
00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.860
and this defines that this is going to be a range input.

149
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.510
The ID is what we can use to access it in liquid.

150
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.185
We need to change this to something that makes more sense.

151
00:09:08.185 --> 00:09:10.165
I'm just going to call it pagination.

152
00:09:10.165 --> 00:09:13.780
Then right here, we need to insert a minimum value.

153
00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.810
Because this is a number, I'm going to get rid of the double quotes and

154
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.605
put in let's say five.

155
00:09:20.605 --> 00:09:23.335
The maximum they can paginate by,

156
00:09:23.335 --> 00:09:25.180
I'm going to say is 25.

157
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.125
The step is the increment that they can use.

158
00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:34.600
I only want them to be able to make a selection in five step increments.

159
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.475
Units, we can put in here as products per page,

160
00:09:39.475 --> 00:09:43.420
but unfortunately this unit attribute has a limit of three characters.

161
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.870
So I'm just not going to use the unit in this instance.

162
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.750
Label is what gets shown to the user.

163
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:55.555
We're going to write in here products per page,

164
00:09:55.555 --> 00:10:00.610
and the default value I'm going to make is five.

165
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.460
If I hit save here,

166
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.185
there are no errors,

167
00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:09.430
thankfully, and then I can refresh the page.

168
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.620
Then once I go into that section,

169
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:17.170
we can actually find our range slider in here and update it.

170
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.365
Now of course, we have created this selection,

171
00:10:20.365 --> 00:10:22.615
but we haven't actually done anything with it.

172
00:10:22.615 --> 00:10:25.420
We're going to need to go back to our section,

173
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.410
and reference this setting value by its ID.

174
00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.275
Instead of here where it says by five,

175
00:10:32.275 --> 00:10:36.505
what I'm going to do is reference that ID.

176
00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:39.910
The way we do that is through the section object.

177
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.300
Because we're in a section, we can access the data within

178
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.525
a schema of a section through this section object.

179
00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:49.645
I start by grabbing that section object,

180
00:10:49.645 --> 00:10:55.540
and now I essentially have access to this and we want to go inside here.

181
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.725
What I'm going to do, put.settings.

182
00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:02.440
Now, I have access to all the settings,

183
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.470
and inside I want to access this one,

184
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.810
which the ID is pagination.

185
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.335
I'm going to type pagination,

186
00:11:11.335 --> 00:11:15.415
and that should be all we need to get this to work.

187
00:11:15.415 --> 00:11:18.520
Going back, refreshing the page.

188
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.195
If I go into collection template now,

189
00:11:22.195 --> 00:11:25.390
and I set it to 10,

190
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.135
should be 10 showing up per page.

191
00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:31.945
This collection only has about 10 products.

192
00:11:31.945 --> 00:11:35.210
Let's go on the old collection.

193
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.500
Now we're in a collection that has more than 10 products.

194
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.135
You can see here, it's defaulted to five, 1, 2, 3,

195
00:11:46.135 --> 00:11:50.845
4, 5, but I can change it to 10, hit "Save."

196
00:11:50.845 --> 00:11:52.570
The page will refresh,

197
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.795
and now we will paginate by 10 instead of five.

198
00:11:55.795 --> 00:11:58.180
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

199
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.990
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

200
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:07.975
That's one way we can make our collection template customizable,

201
00:12:07.975 --> 00:12:13.885
by using a section and giving it a input setting in its schema.

202
00:12:13.885 --> 00:12:15.385
In terms of this section,

203
00:12:15.385 --> 00:12:17.590
the collection template, I'm going to leave it there,

204
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.185
because we're going to talk more about schemas,

205
00:12:20.185 --> 00:12:23.065
and add some more options in later videos.

206
00:12:23.065 --> 00:12:26.020
But what I want to show you is how we can

207
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.935
create a dynamic list of sections on our homepage,

208
00:12:29.935 --> 00:12:33.015
using the special tag content for index.

209
00:12:33.015 --> 00:12:34.845
Now first of all, we're going to have to create

210
00:12:34.845 --> 00:12:38.940
a section that we would want to put on the homepage.

211
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.020
A good idea, something that's pretty common in a lot of themes.

212
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.955
Let's just go to the homepage,

213
00:12:44.955 --> 00:12:46.355
so we can have a look.

214
00:12:46.355 --> 00:12:48.180
There's currently nothing here,

215
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.030
then maybe it'd be nice to have a row of products

216
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.165
show up as a featured collection on the homepage.

217
00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:57.110
Let's actually create that section now.

218
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.560
Going back into our editor,

219
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.435
I'm going to create a new section,

220
00:13:01.435 --> 00:13:06.130
and I'm going to call it featured-collection.

221
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.330
The dot liquid extension gets added automatically, of course.

222
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.550
The first thing I'm going to want to do is change

223
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.940
the section name to "Featured Collection."

224
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.935
Now with this section,

225
00:13:17.935 --> 00:13:22.450
we're not going to specifically include it on any template,

226
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.805
or layout like we've done here.

227
00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:28.630
But we're going to be able to include it in the homepage,

228
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.930
through this dynamic content for index tag.

229
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.285
You'll see what I mean in just a second.

230
00:13:34.285 --> 00:13:39.445
What I'm going to do is I'm going to set up a loop.

231
00:13:39.445 --> 00:13:43.255
Let's copy the loop from here,

232
00:13:43.255 --> 00:13:45.865
for our featured collection.

233
00:13:45.865 --> 00:13:49.105
What we need to do because we're no longer going to be

234
00:13:49.105 --> 00:13:52.465
placing this in the collection template,

235
00:13:52.465 --> 00:13:55.210
is to specify a specific collection,

236
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:59.035
and that's where we now see the assign tag.

237
00:13:59.035 --> 00:14:01.930
Assign allows us to create our own variables.

238
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.400
What I'm going to do here,

239
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:09.310
is select what collection I want to be the collection objects for this.

240
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.670
Again, we're not in the collection template anymore.

241
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.840
We don't know what collection to loop through.

242
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.165
Let's specify this and we can do that using the global collections object,

243
00:14:22.165 --> 00:14:25.405
and accessing its handle.

244
00:14:25.405 --> 00:14:31.285
I'm going to access the Featured Collection,

245
00:14:31.285 --> 00:14:34.885
and let's end to that tag.

246
00:14:34.885 --> 00:14:38.935
Going to hit "Save," and now we should have

247
00:14:38.935 --> 00:14:41.890
a featured collection which allows us to

248
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.940
show the featured collection wherever we include it.

249
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.140
Unfortunately, we can't include it in our content for index section,

250
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.570
without whats called a preset.

251
00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:56.350
We need to write a preset array here.

252
00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:01.640
For that, I'm going to go back into the Shopify documentation.

253
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.560
I think it might be on a different page to this one.

254
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:11.470
There's two pages I end up switching between all the time when I'm programming sections.

255
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:16.990
It's not this one, let's type in, "Presets."

256
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.415
I believe it's in this one, theme sections,

257
00:15:21.415 --> 00:15:25.690
this should be it, if I type in presets,

258
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.665
here we can find the details for presets.

259
00:15:29.665 --> 00:15:33.655
What we can see here is when a section has one or more presets,

260
00:15:33.655 --> 00:15:38.500
each preset becomes a dynamic section emerging can add to their theme homepage,

261
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:43.720
if the content for index object has been included in index.liquid,

262
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.595
so they say it right here,

263
00:15:45.595 --> 00:15:49.445
we need to set a preset at least one preset,

264
00:15:49.445 --> 00:15:51.870
so that we can use it in our content for index.

265
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.605
I'm just going to copy this array that they've set here,

266
00:15:55.605 --> 00:15:57.885
we don't need all these details.

267
00:15:57.885 --> 00:16:02.115
The main purpose behind presets is that we can set

268
00:16:02.115 --> 00:16:06.225
some default settings for the section when it gets included on a page,

269
00:16:06.225 --> 00:16:08.550
but for our purposes we just want to meet

270
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.790
the requirement so that we can actually use it on our homepage.

271
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.190
I'm going to get rid of the settings object,

272
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.150
we only really need category and name for this one,

273
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:23.690
and we're now missing end curly bracket I believe,

274
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:29.295
and we're missing end array tag as well.

275
00:16:29.295 --> 00:16:33.910
Here in category, I'm going to leave that as custom content,

276
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.805
and I'm going to name this featured collection,

277
00:16:36.805 --> 00:16:39.580
and you'll see where this name comes up later.

278
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:45.910
All right so now that we've created this section and it has a preset,

279
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.315
we can now include it in our content for index,

280
00:16:49.315 --> 00:16:50.875
so we need to create that tag,

281
00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:53.395
I'm going to go to the index.liquid page,

282
00:16:53.395 --> 00:16:56.860
replace all of these with that special object,

283
00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:01.975
content_for_index, save that, and now,

284
00:17:01.975 --> 00:17:06.175
when we go to our homepage in the customizer,

285
00:17:06.175 --> 00:17:09.505
might need to refresh the page.

286
00:17:09.505 --> 00:17:14.665
We can now see this button for adding a section, interesting,

287
00:17:14.665 --> 00:17:18.400
let's click it and we'll see here our category

288
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.470
and our name of our section appears in this little menu,

289
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.280
so if we go back to the featured collection,

290
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.720
that's what we wrote here,

291
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.545
the category and the name shows up here,

292
00:17:32.545 --> 00:17:35.890
so now we can click on it, preview it,

293
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:40.135
looks good, and then we can add it right in.

294
00:17:40.135 --> 00:17:42.760
Again we don't have any settings for this yet we're going to set up

295
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.145
some settings in the next video,

296
00:17:45.145 --> 00:17:49.195
but now we have this feature collection and we can add multiple of them,

297
00:17:49.195 --> 00:17:53.440
right now we've had coded the collection that we want to use,

298
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.575
but we can also reorder these,

299
00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.405
turn this off and on,

300
00:17:58.405 --> 00:18:01.990
and this is really user-friendly for the person who's going to

301
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.010
be working with the theme and they don't have to actually touch the code,

302
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.605
so that's why sections are super powerful,

303
00:18:08.605 --> 00:18:12.085
I'm going to hit "Save" on that so it definitely gets included on the page,

304
00:18:12.085 --> 00:18:16.390
that should wrap up this little introduction to sections.

305
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:24.880
We're going to remove all of these for now and let's talk about snippets.

306
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.980
A snippet as I said before,

307
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.515
is a reusable piece of code,

308
00:18:29.515 --> 00:18:33.940
something that is common in Shopify theme development to reuse

309
00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:39.355
multiple times is a product that's shown in a list of products,

310
00:18:39.355 --> 00:18:42.985
so we've done that twice in our theme so far,

311
00:18:42.985 --> 00:18:45.610
we can go into this featured collection here,

312
00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:50.965
and inside this loop we can actually make this a snippet,

313
00:18:50.965 --> 00:18:54.069
and that way when we're looping through products,

314
00:18:54.069 --> 00:18:58.765
maybe not in a featured collection maybe somewhere else and we want to use the same code,

315
00:18:58.765 --> 00:19:03.700
we can just include this snippet without having to write this out every single time,

316
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.480
so I'm going to cut this so it goes to my clipboard,

317
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.815
and I'm going to write the tag to include a snippet,

318
00:19:11.815 --> 00:19:14.785
it's going to be product-item,

319
00:19:14.785 --> 00:19:18.100
I guess I can call it, and I'll hit "Save",

320
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.670
now I will go into snippets and create product-item,

321
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.225
we'll paste that code directly in,

322
00:19:28.225 --> 00:19:32.320
and now anywhere where this snippet gets included,

323
00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.150
it will include this code here.

324
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.715
Now an important thing to note with snippets and sections,

325
00:19:38.715 --> 00:19:42.105
is it gets access to the product objects still,

326
00:19:42.105 --> 00:19:47.985
and it also will get access to the settings within the schema here,

327
00:19:47.985 --> 00:19:53.325
so that way nesting works in Shopify is it feeds from layouts down to templates,

328
00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:55.110
down to sections, down to snippets,

329
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.780
but snippets can be included anywhere.

330
00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.625
What I mean by that is,

331
00:19:59.625 --> 00:20:02.745
if I set a variable here in theme.liquid,

332
00:20:02.745 --> 00:20:07.410
I could access that anywhere in my theme that uses that layout.

333
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:12.860
If I'm in a template for page for instance,

334
00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:17.950
and I included a section that I intended to include on pages only,

335
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:22.105
I could reference the page objects specifically in that section,

336
00:20:22.105 --> 00:20:23.815
and the same goes for snippets,

337
00:20:23.815 --> 00:20:24.925
so for this snippet,

338
00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:30.180
we know that we can use the product object anywhere where we have access to it,

339
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.910
so if we include a product item right

340
00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.825
here in the loop where we've given access to a specific product,

341
00:20:37.825 --> 00:20:41.005
then it'll feed right into the snippet, okay,

342
00:20:41.005 --> 00:20:43.615
so if you include this snippet on a place that doesn't have

343
00:20:43.615 --> 00:20:47.155
a product object specified it will break,

344
00:20:47.155 --> 00:20:51.250
it will not work, but as long as we can rely on this snippet being

345
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:56.200
used in a place where there is a product object, it'll work fine,

346
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.530
just like on sections we can trust that will have access to

347
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.685
a collection if it's on the collection template,

348
00:21:03.685 --> 00:21:08.290
or we can do what we did here and assign the collection specifically,

349
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:13.285
so that's about it for snippets and a good introduction to sections as well hopefully.

350
00:21:13.285 --> 00:21:16.510
I just want to talk about a few more things to ground

351
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.500
out Shopify theme programming, and that is,

352
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.430
we talked about CSS and JavaScript in earlier video,

353
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.750
but let's just demonstrate how we would add some JavaScript to our application,

354
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.860
I can just throw in an annoying alert right here,

355
00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.310
''You loaded the page'',

356
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.275
hit "Save" on that,

357
00:21:38.275 --> 00:21:43.675
now any page I go to in my theme it'll load that JavaScript,

358
00:21:43.675 --> 00:21:47.665
obviously not the best example, but you get the point,

359
00:21:47.665 --> 00:21:50.920
this JavaScript gets loaded into every page,

360
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.155
just that I demo that quickly,

361
00:21:53.155 --> 00:21:55.000
and the same thing for CSS,

362
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.450
if you want a rule to apply everywhere within your theme,

363
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.340
you can put it in here,

364
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:05.020
so maybe we want the font size of everything,

365
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.815
the body font size to be something ridiculous,

366
00:22:08.815 --> 00:22:10.465
let's say 40 pixels,

367
00:22:10.465 --> 00:22:15.470
it's pretty ridiculous if you ask me, refresh the page,

368
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:23.030
nothing's happened, let's see what's going on here in our console,

369
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:30.040
we don't actually have access to our application.css.scss,

370
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.780
let's have a look at that,

371
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:37.870
I think that's because the wrong name has been set,

372
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.630
looks like a bug with the new theme,

373
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:45.115
we're going to go into theme.liquid and change the ordering here,

374
00:22:45.115 --> 00:22:49.720
so it's supposed to be css.scss,

375
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.890
save that, refresh the page,

376
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:58.675
now you'll see all of our font-size gets way bigger,

377
00:22:58.675 --> 00:23:04.705
obviously that's a pretty silly example so I'm going to remove that style.

378
00:23:04.705 --> 00:23:06.520
We've talked about layouts,

379
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.600
we talked about templates,

380
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.295
we've talked about sections,

381
00:23:09.295 --> 00:23:10.945
and we've talked about snippets,

382
00:23:10.945 --> 00:23:12.775
and then we've talked about assets.

383
00:23:12.775 --> 00:23:17.410
Config we'll talk about in the next video when we dive deeper into JSON,

384
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:21.520
but locales, just to mention briefly what that is,

385
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.705
as you can see the title of this file is en.default.json,

386
00:23:25.705 --> 00:23:30.625
and what this file does is hold specific language for English users,

387
00:23:30.625 --> 00:23:32.875
we can create other locales,

388
00:23:32.875 --> 00:23:39.355
and then we can call the right word that we need to use in a specific instance.

389
00:23:39.355 --> 00:23:42.295
We can actually edit this in a user interface as well,

390
00:23:42.295 --> 00:23:47.334
we can go here and click "Edit languages",

391
00:23:47.334 --> 00:23:53.290
and we'll see the same options not in JSON form but in a user interface,

392
00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:58.450
see right here, if I was to actually go in and change this,

393
00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.495
maybe I say, ''Page not found'',

394
00:24:01.495 --> 00:24:03.790
hit "Save" on that,

395
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.625
and I go here notice how this will change,

396
00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:12.744
this is the actual data of what we've set in that user interface,

397
00:24:12.744 --> 00:24:15.625
there we go, page not found,

398
00:24:15.625 --> 00:24:17.050
and it works both ways,

399
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.150
if I was to edit it here in the data file,

400
00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.025
hit "Save" on that,

401
00:24:21.025 --> 00:24:23.605
go back to the user interface,

402
00:24:23.605 --> 00:24:28.825
refresh that, you'll see it's the value we just changed it to.

403
00:24:28.825 --> 00:24:32.920
Now, why this is important for us to understand is when we see

404
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:38.170
these attributes or these objects being called in the actual theme code,

405
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.810
so this one is for the 404 page,

406
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:44.650
and it defines the language that will be on the 404 page,

407
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.675
so let's go to the 404 page,

408
00:24:46.675 --> 00:24:53.320
and we can see here we've got these special tags that are filtered with this t filter,

409
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.275
so if I just remove that,

410
00:24:56.275 --> 00:24:57.505
what do you think is going to happen?

411
00:24:57.505 --> 00:25:01.690
Let's have a look, usually the 404 page comes up if you type

412
00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:06.610
in an address that doesn't exist so I am going to just type in ha ha ha ha ha,

413
00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:13.390
and now instead of seeing the translated version of that you'll just see the code,

414
00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.295
so like I said,

415
00:25:15.295 --> 00:25:19.210
if you just put in a string in an output tag with quotes,

416
00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.180
it's the same thing is just literally putting that on the page,

417
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:27.055
so we need this t tag and what that's going to do is say, ''Hey,

418
00:25:27.055 --> 00:25:33.100
look up this object and then get the value of it and put it on the screen'',

419
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:37.510
so if we see general.404.title,

420
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.445
we go into here,

421
00:25:39.445 --> 00:25:41.290
we start with general,

422
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.840
then we dig into 404 object,

423
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.405
and then we get the property of title,

424
00:25:46.405 --> 00:25:52.910
so now if I refresh the page now that we've replaced or put back in that t tag,

425
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.035
you can see that value comes through.

426
00:25:55.035 --> 00:25:57.960
This is important to note when you're going through editing

427
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.500
your theme and you come across one of these language variables,

428
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.750
maybe you want to create your own which is totally cool,

429
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.715
you just update this JSON file right here,

430
00:26:06.715 --> 00:26:11.125
but it's important to note that when you're programming Shopify themes.

431
00:26:11.125 --> 00:26:13.870
I think this has been quite a long lesson,

432
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.240
a few of these are probably going to be long lessons,

433
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.965
so I'm going to end it there.

434
00:26:17.965 --> 00:26:21.040
In the next video we're going to go deeper into JSON,

435
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.800
so you're going to learn more about how this works and

436
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.920
how to work with JSON in the next video, so I'll see you there.
