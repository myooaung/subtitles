So that pretty much concludes this class on Shopify Theme programming.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.235
For your class project,

3
00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:07.680
I want you to create your own template section,

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.770
snippet, or whole theme if you're feeling adventurous.

5
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.120
As we've seen in this class,

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.480
combining liquid code and JSON Schema allows us to

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.140
create our own customizable templates and sections.

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.720
Now it's your chance to create something you wish

9
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.050
existed and share it with the class if you so choose.

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.430
If you would like to learn more about Shopify theme development and theme programming,

Finally, if you need any tips or guidance on what we've covered in today's class,

13
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.190
be sure to leave a comment in the discussion box

14
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.775
