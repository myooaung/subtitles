1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,010
All right guys, in this lesson we're going to put

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,710
together everything we've learned so far about

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:11,730
Shopify Liquid and JSON Schemas to practice creating our own section.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,335
What I'm going to do is create a gallery section,

5
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:20,940
which will be a section that we can include on the homepage for content,

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,260
for index or on a specific page and it'll just show a gallery of

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,750
images that the user in the customizer specifies.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,570
What I'm going to do, head over the sections,

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,920
add a new section,

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,830
and I'm going to call it gallery.

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,695
As usual, Shopify gives us

12
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:46,675
a Schema and we just need to change the section name to gallery.

13
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:48,860
Hit "Save" on that.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:56,290
I'm going to just set up a div with a class of gallery and there you go.

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,925
Now, how this gallery is going to work is,

16
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:04,925
I'm going to allow the user to specify how many columns they want per row,

17
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:06,950
and then also the height of the image,

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,220
and then I am going to allow them to

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,155
insert blocks which are going to be the images that we will include.

20
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:19,370
Going over to the documentation and looking at the section on

21
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,475
blocks within the document on theme sections,

22
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:28,875
let's scroll back down there again for blocks.

23
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:34,415
You can see here that we can put in blocks which are containers of settings and content,

24
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:35,855
which can be added, removed,

25
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:37,835
and reordered with intersection,

26
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:40,385
and that is ideal for what we're doing here.

27
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:45,695
We want them to be able to add in as many images as they want and reorder them,

28
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:49,580
and we just need the same settings for each.

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm going to skip over the settings array for now and create a blocks array,

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,275
and in this blocks array,

31
00:01:57,275 --> 00:02:00,860
I'm going to open up a block.

32
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,060
Now, for a block,

33
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,810
what we need is a type and a name,

34
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,860
as it says here,

35
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,620
a block must have a name and a type.

36
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,055
A block's type may be any value set by the theme developer.

37
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:16,729
So the type is not something that's specific in Shopify,

38
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:20,520
it's just something that we set ourselves.

39
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,495
I'm going to make the type and image,

40
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:27,095
and you'll see later we can add in

41
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:31,895
different types and then check the type within our section.

42
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:37,665
I'm going to give it a name and call it image block.

43
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:42,185
This is going to be the label that gets shown up to the user.

44
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:46,730
Now, I believe we can just create a settings array just

45
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,610
like we would do on the parent object here.

46
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,150
I'm going to add a settings array,

47
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,415
open that one up and inside start with the first object,

48
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:02,390
which is going to be an image input.

49
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:07,895
For that, we're going to swap over to this part of the documentation called

50
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:13,405
configuring theme settings and I'm going to look for image.

51
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:17,225
The input setting type for an image is

52
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:23,120
image underscore picker and we can just copy the setting value here.

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,590
It's going to be image picker,

54
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,925
we just need a type,

55
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:27,655
ID, and the label.

56
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:33,460
Going back to our code here, pasting that in,

57
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,385
we're going to change the ID to image,

58
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:42,565
and we're just going to put image here, very basic.

59
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:48,440
So that is the settings that we'll have for every block.

60
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,330
If I hit "Save" on that,

61
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,220
let's see if there's any errors, no, there isn't.

62
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:01,265
What I can do now is I can create a loop through all the blocks in OWL section.

63
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:05,630
I'm going to create this loop and I'm going to say,

64
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:12,545
"for block in section.blocks," and then I'm going to enter the loop.

65
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:16,160
We'll format this, make this look a bit nicer in a little bit,

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,995
but for now let's just get this content out in the page.

67
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:26,060
Now, we can reference block directly and I'm just going to create

68
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:33,125
an image tag with the image that gets set, so block.settings.image.

69
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:38,540
Remember how we access different attributes is just navigating this JSON object.

70
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,010
So at the top here,

71
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,825
we find blocks on the section object and now we're looping through

72
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:50,030
an individual block and then we have access to what's in here,

73
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,475
the settings object, and then within that,

74
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:55,280
we can access the attribute using its ID.

75
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,265
That's what's going on here.

76
00:04:57,265 --> 00:04:59,630
If I just output this,

77
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,605
what I'll get is just the image address.

78
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:04,360
Before we can actually look at it, however,

79
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,000
we need to include it somewhere and what I'm going to do for that is

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,340
create an alternate template for page template,

81
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:18,110
and then we're going to use the ultimate template to display this section.

82
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,230
Fortunately, there's a few steps involved with doing this.

83
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:28,790
We need to first go into our templates folder and add an alternate page template.

84
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:34,255
I'm just going to call this one gallery, create the template.

85
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:37,750
One thing that's frustrating with Shopify is we're going

86
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,040
to have to create this on the current theme as well.

87
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,330
So if you're currently working on the theme that you're

88
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,270
previewing and not actually live on your website,

89
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,820
you have to create the same template on your current theme as well otherwise,

90
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,915
you won't be able to select it.

91
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:56,215
But for now what I'm going to do is include this section on here.

92
00:05:56,215 --> 00:06:01,210
So I'm going to strip out all of this and in this custom page template,

93
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,985
just call the gallery section,

94
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:07,615
and I'll hit "Save".

95
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,145
Now as I said,

96
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:11,620
in order for us to select it from the list,

97
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,225
I'm going to have to go into the current live theme,

98
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:22,325
which is debut and create the same template which I may have already done here.

99
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:26,915
There is already a template with the name page.gallery.

100
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:29,124
If that didn't exist,

101
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:31,830
I can just delete that one,

102
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,850
go into add page,

103
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,800
exact same way we've done before for the other theme,

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,445
and what we'll do will insert the same content as the regular page template.

105
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:49,850
So you don't need to worry if you switch this within the page,

106
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,185
it's still going to show the same page template on this theme,

107
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:56,170
if that makes sense.

108
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:01,650
Now, if I go into pages and I add a page,

109
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,565
call it gallery, I can use

110
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:09,070
that specific template that we just created by selecting it here.

111
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,280
If I save the page,

112
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,235
now we can look at what the address of it is.

113
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,895
It's going to be @pages/gallery.

114
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:23,730
So let's go back into the code.

115
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:32,215
As we saw, we have already included the section on that alternate template.

116
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:36,405
Now, we just need to go to the page that we just set up.

117
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:38,970
Pages gallery.

118
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,470
Right now we haven't added any content so nothing is going to show up.

119
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,710
What we want to do is open this page in the customizer.

120
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,210
We're going to have to first refresh because we've made

121
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,880
changes to our theme codes since we had this

122
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,700
open and now we should be able to see that we can edit the gallery template.

123
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,170
Picking on that. Now we can see the section for Gallery.

124
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,005
Just taking it a little bit slower,

125
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:14,140
we're in the page for gallery and as it's using this specific alternate template,

126
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,770
it's going to link directly to this section and

127
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,670
then within that page now for the customizer,

128
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,835
we can see the section showing up here.

129
00:08:24,835 --> 00:08:26,635
So in the gallery,

130
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:28,180
you can now see that there's going to be

131
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,080
this content section and you can add an image block.

132
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,400
That is all from the settings we set up in our gallery section.

133
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,570
So we don't need this anymore,

134
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,955
we just need that one tag.

135
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:44,230
We can start working directly from the gallery section right here.

136
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:50,004
But remember, we called it an image block and so here in the customizer,

137
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:51,475
it's add image block.

138
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:53,260
If there are multiple types,

139
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,275
we'd be able to click this and it give us different options,

140
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,480
but we just have the one option for now.

141
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,450
As you can see, there's our image setting that we've got here.

142
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,940
We can now add an image.

143
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:15,640
We've got men on the front and we can add another image, block,

144
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,205
the guy with the suit and you can see here what happens when I do that.

145
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:22,990
Instead of the actual image,

146
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,650
we've got a URL section.

147
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,730
What's happening here is that the image being

148
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,615
selected is not actually going to give you an image tag.

149
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,180
So in order to get the image tag,

150
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:42,810
what I'm going to do is use the image tag filter right here.

151
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,145
Now, we may need to specify a distinct path as well,

152
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,920
let's have a look, so there you go,

153
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,485
they are showing up and because we didn't

154
00:09:52,485 --> 00:09:55,680
add a parameter they are showing up quite small,

155
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,075
this should be 100 by 100.

156
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:03,040
If we have a look, so the width is a 100 and

157
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,890
then the height is relative to the width in terms of its aspect ratio.

158
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,995
We're going to need to make them a bit bigger.

159
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:17,480
I'm going to add in a parameter for this image tag of, let's say 500x.

160
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,220
So now they're going to be five times as bigger,

161
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,545
five times as big, rather.

162
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:27,340
I've made a mistake here and I see that the parameter,

163
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,275
it actually represents the alt tag.

164
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:33,895
If you want to put in alt value, that's where you put it.

165
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:38,530
What I need to do is chain another filter in here.

166
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:42,730
I'm going to filter this for image URL like

167
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:48,235
before and that's where I can specify the dimension of the image.

168
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:51,445
I'll save that, refresh the page,

169
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:55,820
and now the image is five times as big.

170
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,535
What we've got here is we've got,

171
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,520
if I just refresh the page in the customizer,

172
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,290
we've got this gallery.

173
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,675
So we can add another image block.

174
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:09,955
If the image isn't set yet,

175
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:12,640
Shopify just inserts a place holder,

176
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,560
which isn't very beautiful,

177
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,620
but it shows us that there is at least supposed to be

178
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,010
an image there and I can add in another image,

179
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,500
and basically what's going to happen is they're all going to

180
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,560
be 500 wide and they're just going to

181
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,185
stack across the horizontal and vertical space of our page.

182
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:33,880
If I refresh the page,

183
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,250
maybe this is good enough for your gallery,

184
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,250
but I want to make this way more responsive.

185
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,650
What I'm going to do is I am going to give this

186
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:50,650
a responsive width and create a height that the user can change.

187
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,560
What I'm going to do is in here,

188
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,350
instead of just outputting an image,

189
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:03,535
what I'm going to do is create a image wrap and in this image wrap tag,

190
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:09,460
I'm going to give it a background image of the image that we set here.

191
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,520
The benefit of doing this if you're not familiar,

192
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:18,160
is that we can control the height and width of the div and then the image will fit within

193
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,370
that and it'll crop based on the dimensions of this div tag right here.

194
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:30,010
What I'm going do is add in a style attribute and have

195
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:35,604
background image URL and I don't need the image tag anymore,

196
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:38,980
and I can insert this here.

197
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,145
Now we need to give it some dimensions.

198
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:44,830
Just to give it something straight away,

199
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:52,060
I'm going to give it a width of 500 pixels and a height of 500 pixels,

200
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,560
and then I'm going to give it a [inaudible] ,

201
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,090
create some space here.

202
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:08,350
Here we go. Then I'm going to give it a background size of cover. Save that.

203
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,545
See what happens when we refresh the page.

204
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:14,725
You'll see now, if we have a look,

205
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,630
these aren't image tags anymore,

206
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,550
they are actually divs,

207
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,880
and that's why they're stacking on top of each other because these are

208
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,375
set to default to display block,

209
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,820
as you can see here in the computed values.

210
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,635
We want them to display next to each other, so inline-block.

211
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,720
Now, we can either set it up in

212
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:42,700
our main CSS file or we can do it in the actual section by refactoring this to style,

213
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,675
not style sheet and putting in our styles here.

214
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:48,280
Now, in this case,

215
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,270
I'm going to put it in the actual section and there's a good reason for that,

216
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,465
because when we use these style tags,

217
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:59,605
we can see things live update in the customizer.

218
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:04,540
We could always just throw in styles using HTML.

219
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,895
But if we do this,

220
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:10,495
if there is a user generated style within here,

221
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:13,960
like something they set in the customizer and we changed that.

222
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,660
It's not going to show up straight away.

223
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,900
So using these liquid tags,

224
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,810
we can actually store our styles in

225
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,950
the section and that's going to make it easier to find.

226
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,590
But also we're going to get the ability to see

227
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:34,180
those live update if we use customize a data in here.

228
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,700
So I'll show you what I mean by that in just a sec,

229
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,295
but first I'm going to create a style rule in here

230
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,535
for image rap and what I'm going to do is

231
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:49,315
set all image wraps to display inline block and if we go over to our page,

232
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:54,595
even the customizer or over here and refresh the page.

233
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:58,660
We'll see they are now stack next to each other.

234
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,350
If we go over here,

235
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,775
we'll see that we've got display inline block.

236
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:08,540
This is a little bit better because if we resize the window,

237
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:14,730
so I'm going to move this over to the side and see how the window resizes.

238
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:19,310
It's going to knock it down to the new line if there's no space.

239
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,770
But to make it a bit more responsive,

240
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:28,380
what I'm going to do is I'm going to set the width to a relative value.

241
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,040
Going back into here,

242
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,125
we're going to set image rap to width of 33 percent.

243
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,350
That way we get three in a row.

244
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,100
So I'm going to remove this value right

245
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:52,970
here and actually let's move these values into the class just to make it a bit cleaner.

246
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,530
Right here, these are going to be the same for every image rap,

247
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:06,010
so we're going to put this down here in the actual style row here.

248
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:12,010
Refresh the page and now you can see our images are responsive.

249
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,505
So again, if I was to resize,

250
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:19,105
you can see there's always going to be three on a row

251
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:24,835
and they're going to resize in order to achieve that on any screen size.

252
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:29,000
Now, for the user, they might want to choose how many images they're up for

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,190
a row and they also might want to be able to change the height of the images,

254
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,670
because, as I said,

255
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,945
with responsive images, they automatically crop.

256
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:39,725
Like we saw before,

257
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:41,480
if I reduce this,

258
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,400
they're always going to be three on every row,

259
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,940
so now we're losing parts of the image.

260
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:52,990
So maybe we want to make this less tall if we're using a lot of images per row.

261
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,320
Anyway. So I want to give the option to the user to be able to

262
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,360
affect this value and also the ability to affect this value.

263
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,985
Because this is going to happen to the entire grid,

264
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:07,280
this is going to be a setting up here,

265
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,110
not in a specific block.

266
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:18,895
The first setting I want to do is I think I'm going to have a select.

267
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:20,810
We haven't used select before.

268
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:27,335
So let's go into the different input types we have available to us and look at select.

269
00:17:27,335 --> 00:17:30,740
I'm going to grab the example as

270
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:36,775
a starting point and replace this empty objects with the example.

271
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:40,135
So we've got the type of select,

272
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:42,055
I'm going to set this to,

273
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:47,615
per row and it's going to show to the user products, oh sorry,

274
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:51,710
images per row, and then for our options,

275
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,795
we don't need a group,

276
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:56,880
we just need a value and a label.

277
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,095
In our options array,

278
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:03,725
I'm going to have three different values and this is going to be the widths.

279
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:06,545
If they choose two per row,

280
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,145
it's going to be 50 percent.

281
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:13,370
So two per row and if they choose three per row,

282
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,615
it's going to be 33 percent, three per row.

283
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:20,230
We need to duplicate that across,

284
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,590
ends this one 44 per row,

285
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,470
is going to be 25 percent.

286
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,100
Let's just do five per row as well.

287
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:37,900
Add in another option and we'll make this one five per row.

288
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,615
The default, it has to be one of these.

289
00:18:40,615 --> 00:18:42,940
Let's make the default three per row.

290
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,640
That's going to be 33 percent and the info we don't, really need.

291
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,430
I'm going to hit "Save" here and I've deliberately added in a error,

292
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,660
or I've deliberately left an error in my JSON schema.

293
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,445
Now, unfortunately,

294
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:04,915
in Shopify in their code editor and when you're using theme kit as well,

295
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:09,565
they just say error invalid JSON and if you have a big schema,

296
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,910
it could take you forever to figure out what the issue is.

297
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,310
So I know what I've done wrong,

298
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,565
but maybe you can't pick it right now.

299
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:22,375
Luckily, because it is just a JSON object,

300
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,870
we can actually put it through a JSONLinta and

301
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,115
see what the issue is.So I just want to show you how to do that right now.

302
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:34,435
I know that the issue right here is that we've got a comma at the end here.

303
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:36,760
So remember we remove that value.

304
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,955
The last value cannot have a comma after it,

305
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:46,435
but we might not know that so one thing we can do is use a online JSONLinta,

306
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:51,010
so I've just copied the whole JSON object and I'm

307
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:56,570
going to go to a website called jsonlint.com I believe.

308
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,910
I'm going to paste in our JSON object,

309
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,760
doesn't matter that it represents Shopify data.

310
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,110
All this does is take the format of the JSON and check whether it is correctly formatted.

311
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,535
So right here, we have a much more detailed error message,

312
00:20:12,535 --> 00:20:15,430
which is we've got an error on line 24.

313
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:20,410
It expected a string it got a closing curly bracket.

314
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,775
So that's still might take a little bit deciphering to figure out what the issue is here.

315
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:27,655
But at least we get a specific line number and we can say,

316
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:29,995
oh, I've got this comma here.

317
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,065
So if I go back,

318
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,525
take away that comma,

319
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:39,490
hit save, now you'll see that we have no errors.

320
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,805
So the next thing I need to do is actually reference

321
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:45,760
this value that's been set in the customizer here.

322
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,910
So instead of 33 percent I'm going to,

323
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,090
as we have done numerous times throughout this class,

324
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,250
reference the section object,

325
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,345
go into its settings and grab per row.

326
00:20:58,345 --> 00:21:04,465
I'm going to hit save on that and let's go back into our customizer and refresh.

327
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:09,130
All right, so now I'm going to go into the gallery section and you can see that we

328
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,900
now have a drop-down for selecting how many images per row.

329
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,625
If I change this to two,

330
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:20,290
it doesn't work with 50 unfortunately but if I change this to four,

331
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,990
you can see this live updating.

332
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,670
Unfortunately, there are some margins that are affecting how

333
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,140
many can fit per row so we just need to change that.

334
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,465
But you can see this is live updating.

335
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:39,160
So going to hit save on that,

336
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,159
you can see if we look at this in the browser,

337
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,590
these are each going to be 50 percent.

338
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,230
This is a little bit of an issue with inline-block,

339
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,100
but if we reduce it by 0.5 percent,

340
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,160
that should get around the issue of margins and now you can

341
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,370
see we've got a two by two grid.

342
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,680
So I'm just going to go back into our code here.

343
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,335
Change two per row,

344
00:22:05,335 --> 00:22:09,050
give it a percent of wiggle room.

345
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,590
Same thing here, and same thing here.

346
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,005
That should hopefully get around that issue.

347
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:20,965
Now if we refresh the page on both of these,

348
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:26,830
let's do it in the customizer so that we can actually live update this.

349
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,870
Change it to three per row,

350
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,195
change it to two per row,

351
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:35,365
four per row and we don't have five,

352
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:37,720
but if we did have a fifth one,

353
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,130
it will show up here.

354
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,335
All right, pretty cool.

355
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:42,820
Now, as I mentioned,

356
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,800
if we're showing two per row,

357
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,295
then we've got a nice aspect ratio going on here.

358
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:51,565
But if we set it to four per row,

359
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:54,070
we're going to lose a lot of the image because remember they

360
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,680
crop automatically in order to stay responsive.

361
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,665
So I also want to give the user the ability to specify the height of all these images.

362
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:04,510
So let's add that in now.

363
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,065
I'm going to add it in as another select.

364
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:15,220
So, whoops, let's go copy that example again from

365
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:24,505
the documentation and replace this empty object with that.

366
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:27,115
This one is going to be the heights,

367
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,250
and I'm going to call it image height.

368
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,900
We don't need group,

369
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,370
as I mentioned before,

370
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,340
the default value is going to be,

371
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,090
let's say, what do we have right now, 500 pixels.

372
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,655
Let's say it's going to be 500 pixels.

373
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,515
Don't need need info.

374
00:23:44,515 --> 00:23:54,760
So we'll make the last 1500 pixels and this 1300 pixels.

375
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,195
Now we probably want to make more options.

376
00:23:58,195 --> 00:24:02,245
So let's just create one extra option,

377
00:24:02,245 --> 00:24:03,970
you probably want a few more as well,

378
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,310
but it's the same process for each.

379
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:10,330
So let's just put this somewhere in between 400.

380
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,150
Now before I hit save on that,

381
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,130
I'm going to actually insert it.

382
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,235
So just like I've done here,

383
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:22,180
instead of coding or hard-coding in a height,

384
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:28,870
I'm going to reference this setting so put it in there as height.

385
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,365
Again, we've got an error in JSON schema.

386
00:24:32,365 --> 00:24:37,405
I know that just from the last one we've got the same era we've got this comma here.

387
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:38,890
If you didn't pick that up,

388
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,815
you can always put it for the JSONLinta.

389
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:46,285
So now if I look at this in the customizer,

390
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,445
we've got an issue here.

391
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:53,320
Let's have a look on what we might be doing wrong here.

392
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,900
I forgot to put the semicolon on the end, refresh the page.

393
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,225
So now we should be able to,

394
00:25:01,225 --> 00:25:02,980
as the user in the customizer,

395
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,070
change the image height. There you go.

396
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,055
So if we're doing a four images per row,

397
00:25:09,055 --> 00:25:12,385
we probably want the image height to get smaller as well.

398
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,010
So we can set a smaller image height.

399
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,785
We can set it to 400,

400
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:21,565
it's 500 so a good combination,

401
00:25:21,565 --> 00:25:24,610
maybe on two per row we have it set to 500.

402
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,920
But if we're doing four per row,

403
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:32,710
we set it to something a little bit shorter, like 300.

404
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,160
Now, I know this video is probably pretty long already,

405
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,175
but I want to show you one other thing, and that is,

406
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:42,925
we can add in different types of content in this gallery.

407
00:25:42,925 --> 00:25:44,680
Doesn't need to just be photos,

408
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,700
we can actually add in embedded videos as well.

409
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,030
For this, I don't want to be writing a lot of codes,

410
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,085
I'm going to be copying across something,

411
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:57,145
but it should be pretty simple to understand regardless,

412
00:25:57,145 --> 00:26:00,850
what I'm going to do first because we're going to use a different type,

413
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,740
is put in a conditional.

414
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,565
I'm going to say block type, remember,

415
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:10,390
we now have access to the individual block because we're looping through,

416
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,360
and if the block type is image,

417
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,815
then I know I'm going to have an image setting.

418
00:26:17,815 --> 00:26:23,485
I'll close that, and if now because all of our block so far,

419
00:26:23,485 --> 00:26:25,360
the type of image,

420
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,450
nothing should change when we refresh the page.

421
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,475
Now, everything is normal,

422
00:26:30,475 --> 00:26:35,965
but we can add in a different type here.

423
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:40,940
Instead of wherever we got here,

424
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,855
I'm going to add in another block for a video embed.

425
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:50,640
I'm just going to copy and paste to make this a little bit quicker,

426
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,455
and this one instead of image is going to be a video block,

427
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:59,620
and this is going to be the label that shows up to the user,

428
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,939
and for the settings,

429
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:05,620
I'm going to, I believe it's called a video URL,

430
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:12,790
and so the ID of that is going to be video URL is it's just called a video URL as well,

431
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,720
and the label is going to be video URL.

432
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,745
I think there are a few more attributes I've got right here to look at,

433
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:25,525
we can put in what it accepts as well.

434
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:31,840
We can make it except YouTube and Vimeo.

435
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,210
We're going to need to remove that comma of the end,

436
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,965
otherwise, we'll get an error.

437
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:39,535
If I hit Save on that, hopefully no errors,

438
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:43,720
and now when I refresh the page and our customizer,

439
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,670
and I go to the gallery,

440
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,620
instead of add image block,

441
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,270
it's just going to say add content.

442
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,340
The reason why is when I click this,

443
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,165
it's now going to give me the option to add in the different types.

444
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:58,090
I can add in another image block like before,

445
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,285
or I can add in a video block.

446
00:28:01,285 --> 00:28:05,845
In here I can paste a YouTube or Vimeo link.

447
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:09,640
For that, I just need to find a YouTube video,

448
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,185
I'm going to quickly find one from my own YouTube channel.

449
00:28:14,185 --> 00:28:16,420
What better video to use then,

450
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,125
one of my videos from my series on Shopify theme development,

451
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:24,565
let's use that as the example video right here,

452
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:26,275
and let's hit save.

453
00:28:26,275 --> 00:28:28,855
Now, even though we've saved this video block,

454
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:31,675
we need to actually output something to the screen.

455
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:35,410
What I'm going to do is copy across some logic here,

456
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,880
but what I'm going to do is because it's going to be different code for

457
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,560
the video block instead of

458
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,030
the image block is I'm going to put the conditional in straight away.

459
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:51,100
This value here is what we created here,

460
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,495
so we've got type, image,

461
00:28:52,495 --> 00:28:56,230
type video, this is what we are checking right now.

462
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,690
Now, I'm going to copy and paste in some code,

463
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,090
to save us a bit of time.

464
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,090
To briefly explain this code,

465
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,965
what we've got going on here is if the block type is video,

466
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:10,735
we know that this is a video block,

467
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:13,000
and if the URL is blank,

468
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,800
we're going to put in a placeholder video with these different attributes.

469
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,090
If it isn't blank,

470
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,590
then it definitely has a value,

471
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,380
so we just check if the type is YouTube,

472
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,875
if so, we use the YouTube embed link, if not,

473
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,915
we check for Vimeo,

474
00:29:28,915 --> 00:29:30,100
and if it is Vimeo,

475
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,820
we use the Vimeo embed link,

476
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,960
and then we grab the ID of video URL.

477
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,885
This is a bit more of a complicated one because

478
00:29:40,885 --> 00:29:44,514
we actually get an object out of this video URL,

479
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:49,360
and so we've got an ID and a type on that object.

480
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,450
That's why I copied and pasted this code because it is a little bit more

481
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,780
complex and it's not very common that you would use this anyway,

482
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,970
but this is a good example here of having different types.

483
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:08,840
What we're going to need to do to finish this off is also have this effect our iframe.

484
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,960
In each of these scenarios,

485
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,930
the iframe is going to contain the video,

486
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,960
so I have just added the iframe onto here as well.

487
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,840
It's going to have display inline-block width

488
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,375
and height that we've set in the customizer.

489
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:25,209
This one is not going to make any sense for the iframe,

490
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:27,175
but hopefully it still works,

491
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:30,430
if I go now into,

492
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,145
let's have a look in the customizer.

493
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:38,515
You'll see we've got my video showing up, unfortunately,

494
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:41,125
the width isn't correct,

495
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:45,115
so let's refresh the page,

496
00:30:45,115 --> 00:30:46,795
see what's going on.

497
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:48,880
Here we've got our image wraps, image wraps,

498
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,460
image wraps, and then we've got the iframe here,

499
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,280
which doesn't have any styles attributed to it,

500
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,350
so it's just doing width and height.

501
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,735
Let me look at what I could've done wrong here,

502
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:03,689
and I can see I've put a dot in front of iframe,

503
00:31:03,689 --> 00:31:05,220
presuming it's a class,

504
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,440
but I'm targeting the element itself,

505
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,780
so I don't need to use that dot.

506
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,945
If I refresh the page,

507
00:31:11,945 --> 00:31:17,020
you'll now see that it conforms to our grid that we've set up.

508
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,390
Let's customize that in the customizer,

509
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,050
maybe let's set it to five per row.

510
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,900
Let's do five per row,

511
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,830
and now you can see that the video embed is

512
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:34,880
the fifth item in this row and we can actually reorder the content.

513
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,540
Now, the user can go in,

514
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:42,040
add any number of image blocks and video Blocks,

515
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:47,020
maybe some nice women's fashion videos and photos,

516
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,345
and that'll go on to the new line.

517
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:51,715
We might need to play around with mobile styles,

518
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:53,815
change the grid to be different on mobile,

519
00:31:53,815 --> 00:31:55,555
so we're going to need some media queries,

520
00:31:55,555 --> 00:31:58,420
but that is perhaps a project for yourself to take on,

521
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,820
I just wanted to give us some practice with schemas and liquid,

522
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,780
and what better way to do that is through a section.

523
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,810
If we want to be able to put this on the homepage,

524
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:15,085
don't forget, we need to insert a preset on here.

525
00:32:15,085 --> 00:32:17,620
Let's just do that to finish the lesson,

526
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,880
so we'll put a Presets array, and again,

527
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:28,285
I'm going to go back to the reference numerous times presets right here,

528
00:32:28,285 --> 00:32:33,560
we just need one with a category and a name.

529
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:39,220
Going back here, put in an object,

530
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,780
I've put up that object.

531
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,250
We've got category of what do we call the other one.

532
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,750
I think it was custom content,

533
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,404
so you can get it to show up in the same category,

534
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:52,780
and we'll give this a name of gallery,

535
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,745
hit Save on that.

536
00:32:54,745 --> 00:33:00,535
Now, this section will be able to be included on the homepage as well.

537
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:02,230
If I go to the homepage,

538
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:07,465
add a section, we've got a problem here. That's right.

539
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:10,630
I haven't reloaded, a customizer yet,

540
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,685
always remember to do that guys.

541
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:14,410
Now when I add in a section,

542
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,360
you'll see gallery is here,

543
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,970
and it won't hold the same data as the place over here,

544
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,310
because every time a section is included,

545
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,365
it's got its own data.

546
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:31,240
We can go in and create different galleries.

547
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,920
There we go, let's put it in another image block, the woman's fashion,

548
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,130
and let's make the last one a video,

549
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,455
let's see if I got the add up.

550
00:33:41,455 --> 00:33:43,600
Haven't got the video link,

551
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,670
but there you can see the placeholder there.

552
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:51,505
We've got our custom gallery section,

553
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:53,860
we can put it into our homepage now,

554
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,165
we can use it on specific pages, and by now,

555
00:33:58,165 --> 00:34:04,569
you should have a pretty solid understanding of a Shopify liquid and schemas.

556
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:09,205
Now of course, the more experience you gain with Shopify liquid,

557
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:10,480
the better you'll get at it,

558
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,645
but I believe this should be a good foundation for you guys.

559
00:34:13,645 --> 00:34:21,235
Remember the documentation, the liquid reference right here, where is it?

560
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:23,905
Liquid reference there you go.

561
00:34:23,905 --> 00:34:26,680
This is your textbook,

562
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,330
this is your documentation,

563
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,025
you've also got my article,

564
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:34,720
which I'll highly recommends to give you a different perspective on Shopify liquid,

565
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,240
and then you've got the cheat sheet as well,

566
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,455
but that's more of like a quick reference.

567
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:42,450
For anything to do with learning all the different parts,

568
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,995
maybe there's an area of liquid

569
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:47,280
you don't know too much about and you want to learn more about.

570
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,540
Either check out the blog post or check out the official documentation.

571
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,135
Look it up, see if you can gain an understanding that way,

572
00:34:55,135 --> 00:35:01,870
because now we'll be moving on from liquid to talk about the Ajax API.

573
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,480
Remember, I said that Shopify liquid is like

574
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,970
the back-end programming language with Shopify.

575
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:10,045
If we want to do something purely on the client side,

576
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:12,819
we're going to need to use JavaScript, and luckily,

577
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,490
within our theme, we've got this API called

578
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,150
the Ajax API to allow us to do certain things.

579
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,850
We'll learn all about that in the next lesson

580
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,505
and maybe two lessons if it's a particularly long one,

581
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:28,130
anyways, I'm excited for the next one, I'll see you there.
