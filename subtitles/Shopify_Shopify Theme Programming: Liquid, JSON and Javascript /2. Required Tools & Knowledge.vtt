00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
As this class is the SQL to Shopify theme development,

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.225
how to build and customize your own online store,

3
00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:09.150
it is advised that you take that class first as

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.480
this class assumes you understand what a development story is,

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.560
how themekit works, and the folder structure of your Shopify theme.

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.200
Understanding theme structure is especially important

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.780
for this class as we'll be jumping straight into

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.330
the files without talking too much about

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.255
where they all fit into the Shopify themes structure.

10
00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:32.625
The focus of this course is exclusively on the programming aspects of Shopify themes.

11
00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.885
Of course, if you need more of that theoretical knowledge around themes,

12
00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:39.600
definitely check out the first class.

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.725
Now, because this class is all about code,

14
00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:44.150
you're going to need a good code editor.

15
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.980
The one I will use in this class will be the online editor in the Shopify admin but it is

16
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.750
highly recommended that you use

17
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.430
your own code editor and use themekit to download your theme code.

18
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.195
Secondly, you obviously need a web browser,

19
00:00:57.195 --> 00:00:59.895
and third, you'll need your own Shopify store.

20
00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:01.830
This store doesn't need to be a real store.

21
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.145
Of course, it can be a development store.

22
00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:07.620
You don't need to actually pay Shopify to work on themes.

23
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.170
If you don't know what I'm talking about,

24
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.055
checkout lesson 3 of the previous class.

25
00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:13.560
Now, I mentioned before, themekit,

26
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.685
if you haven't already,

27
00:01:14.685 --> 00:01:19.295
head to shopify.github.io/themekit and grab that now,

28
00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:20.690
I highly recommend it.

29
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.520
That's basically it for the tools.

30
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.915
But in terms of knowledge,

31
00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:25.715
besides knowing about themes,

32
00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:31.595
you're going to need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

33
00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:35.120
These are the three important languages that make up the web,

34
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.240
and we won't be covering them specifically in this class

35
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.870
so if you need to gain an understanding of any of these,

36
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.805
simply check out some of my other classes first.

37
00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.400
That was quite the list.

38
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.405
Let's quickly summarize before we move on.

39
00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:52.730
In terms of knowledge, you're going to need to have at least

40
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.030
a basic understanding of the Shopify Platform,

41
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.710
the structure of Shopify themes,

42
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.555
I'm talking about layouts, templates,

43
00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:02.030
sections, etc., and finally,

44
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.705
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

45
00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:08.405
For the tools, you'll need a code editor, a web browser,

46
00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:10.610
and a Shopify store to work on,

47
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.115
and Shopify Themekit if you're working with your code locally.

48
00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:17.600
If you've got all of that, you're now ready to

49
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.260
jump straight into the next lesson so I'll see you there.
