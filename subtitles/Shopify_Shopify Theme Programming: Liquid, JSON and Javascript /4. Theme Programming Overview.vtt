00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.734
For the majority of this class on Shopify theme programming,

2
00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:06.045
we're going to be talking about liquid.

3
00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:09.615
Liquid is the templating language of Shopify themes,

4
00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:14.460
you can think of it as the back-end programming language of your Shopify theme,

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.785
and therefore your online storefront.

6
00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:22.155
Of course, we can create online storefronts that link to Shopify as data in other ways.

7
00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:28.365
But the majority of the time when somebody is using Shopify to host an online store,

8
00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:32.610
they are using this online store sales channel in the way that

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.975
you customize the look and feel of your online store is through a theme.

10
00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:42.210
You should be well familiar with this if you need to learn more about theme development,

11
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.370
what is a theme, and where it sits in the context of your store?

12
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.625
I have a series on YouTube and a previous class

13
00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:53.560
on Shopify theme development here on Skill Share.

14
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.400
So this class is going to be primarily concerned with Shopify theme programming,

15
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.630
as the name suggests,

16
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.950
and so we're going to be learning more about programming patents,

17
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.270
so we're going be working with Liquid a lot.

18
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.250
That being said, last class,

19
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.440
we worked directly with the Debut theme,

20
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.150
which is an already built theme that looks like this,

21
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.340
if you're not familiar,

22
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.605
it's a already built theme.

23
00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:19.760
You don't really need to go in and build basic features,

24
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.910
unless you need to create something that doesn't exist already.

25
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.605
Because if you look at the code of this theme,

26
00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:30.065
it's already quite full,

27
00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:35.604
so if I look at any given section,

28
00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:38.775
you'll see it's quite full of code.

29
00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:40.890
In this class, what I'm going to do,

30
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.720
is instead of starting from the point of an actual theme,

31
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.020
which is more practical if you're actually doing Shopify theme development,

32
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.580
I'm going to start with a very bare-bones theme called New Theme.

33
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.265
This theme right here you can see is very bare-bones.

34
00:01:58.265 --> 00:01:59.900
The homepage has nothing on it,

35
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.265
if I click Catalog,

36
00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:04.790
it takes me to the collection where I see all products,

37
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.320
and it's currently paginating by two products at a time.

38
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.955
Keep in mind that in order for you to test and actually program a Shopify theme,

39
00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:15.830
you're going to need some store data,

40
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.785
so I've put in this dummy data already.

41
00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:24.125
You'll need to put in some test products as well if you want anything to display.

42
00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:25.550
If I click on Blog,

43
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.410
you can see I've copied over some blog posts from the official Shopify website.

44
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.510
Now, if you want to code along,

45
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.370
and use this exact theme,

46
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.185
the way I generated this theme,

47
00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:39.230
and the reason why it's called the New Theme is,

48
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.805
because I used a command in Theme Kit, called,

49
00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:47.000
Theme New, so for those of you who aren't familiar with Theme Kit,

50
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.399
we're not going to go into great detail,

51
00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:55.070
I have a 20 minute lesson in my last class here on Shopify theme development,

52
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.150
all about how to set it up and configure it,

53
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.370
but this is what I'm talking about when I talk about Shopify Theme Kit.

54
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.350
It's basically a command line tool that you can use to download your theme,

55
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.410
and then you can edit it with your own computer.

56
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.310
I highly recommend if you're doing Shopify theme development seriously,

57
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.715
you use the Theme Kit.

58
00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:19.880
But as this class is not really about development workflow and just about programming,

59
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.580
I'm going to be using the online code editor,

60
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.905
so I'm going to just click Edit code here,

61
00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:31.105
and we're going to edit it straight from here.

62
00:03:31.105 --> 00:03:33.010
Now I should mention

63
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.210
one other framework and tool that you can use to create Shopify themes,

64
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.205
it's called slate, so if I type in Shopify Slate into Google,

65
00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:45.040
you can learn more about it.

66
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.695
As you can read on this GitHub page,

67
00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:52.420
slate is on low maintenance.

68
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.550
Slate is a project that Shopify have

69
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.265
created but they're not really maintaining at the moment,

70
00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:58.855
that could change in future,

71
00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:03.430
and slate is a lot more technical and hard to setup,

72
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.540
so we're not going to be focused on slate in this class as well.

73
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.940
I just thought it would be remiss of me not to mention,

74
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.470
and again, if you want to learn more about slate,

75
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.930
there is a bonus video in the previous class

76
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.480
on Shopify theme development, go check it out.

77
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.870
It is the second last video.

78
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.490
Now, getting rid of that tab there and going back to our New Theme here,

79
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.500
the reason why I wanted to start with the New Theme is it's quiet bare,

80
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.905
so we can see here there's not a lot Liquid code,

81
00:04:33.905 --> 00:04:36.920
there's only 10 lines in the index file,

82
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.630
there's only one layout,

83
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.180
and if we go down here to sections and snippets,

84
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.235
they are completely empty.

85
00:04:43.235 --> 00:04:48.500
There's only one language file and one CSS file,

86
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.435
and one JavaScript file.

87
00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:51.859
This is pretty bare-bones,

88
00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:54.905
and it's going to allow us to learn the concepts

89
00:04:54.905 --> 00:04:58.190
of Liquid programming easier without having to

90
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.080
sift through a whole bunch of HTML and CSS that would exist on a fully built theme.

91
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.560
As I previously mentioned,

92
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.270
you can consider Liquid the back-end programming language of Shopify themes.

93
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.760
What I mean by that is that all this code is generated on the server side,

94
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.895
and then it comes through the client side in HTML and CSS.

95
00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:28.190
Just to demonstrate that for those of you who the concept is not particularly clear,

96
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.430
look at all these liquid tags,

97
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.590
these aren't going to come through on the front end,

98
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.750
is all generated on the server side,

99
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.190
and then it comes through on the front end as just HTML and CSS,

100
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.670
so if I click on this page,

101
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.025
which gets me to the collection template,

102
00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:49.100
and I inspect what's going on here,

103
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.520
I won't see any Liquid code whatsoever.

104
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.520
The Liquid code is all on the server side,

105
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.680
so the reason why that's important is,

106
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.445
because anything I want to do that I want on the client side,

107
00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:03.470
still has to be done with JavaScript,

108
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.530
and that becomes an issue of how do we access that data using JavaScript,

109
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.495
and then work with it on the front end without having to reload the page.

110
00:06:14.495 --> 00:06:19.065
You should be familiar with the difference between server side and client side, if not,

111
00:06:19.065 --> 00:06:21.415
check out my first class on Skill Share,

112
00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:24.940
I have a video on the difference between front-end and back-end.

113
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.940
But that is just something to note.

114
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.385
Liquid covers most of Shopify the programming, but of course,

115
00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:33.680
if you want more interactive features,

116
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.630
if you want to avoid reloading the page,

117
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.230
you're going to have to use JavaScript.

118
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.400
Back to the code, you can see a bunch of Liquid tags,

119
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.285
and you can see that they even start with a curly bracket and a percentage sign,

120
00:06:47.285 --> 00:06:50.150
and end with a percentage sign curly bracket,

121
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.265
or there are just two curly braces,

122
00:06:53.265 --> 00:06:55.880
and the difference between these two tags is,

123
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.545
this is for logic,

124
00:06:57.545 --> 00:06:58.850
and this is for output.

125
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.200
What I mean by that is,

126
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.610
if I just throw collection dot title in-between these double curly braces tags,

127
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.755
it'll just output the collection title.

128
00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:10.850
There's no operations or logic happening on it,

129
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.410
unless of course, I use a filter which is down here.

130
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.850
Obviously, there's a lot of concepts and syntax within Liquid,

131
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.850
and for that, I have created my own documentation for that.

132
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.295
This is my blog post which is not currently out yet,

133
00:07:28.295 --> 00:07:30.900
but will be out by the time you're watching this video,

134
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.315
so I'm still working on it.

135
00:07:32.315 --> 00:07:37.580
But essentially, this is going to be the textbook or reference for this class,

136
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.380
so it's a very long article,

137
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.075
I cover all the objects,

138
00:07:42.075 --> 00:07:46.305
all the filters, all the tags within Liquid,

139
00:07:46.305 --> 00:07:48.365
so for this class,

140
00:07:48.365 --> 00:07:50.825
I thought of going through all the theory,

141
00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:55.510
but I thought it's going to be a lot better for you to actually read up on this stuff,

142
00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:00.090
and then we can actually practice and see it in action in our theme,

143
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.930
so I'm going to create these patterns and break this down,

144
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.180
but for reference, we're going to use this document.

145
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.390
This article is going to be at christhefreelancer.com/shopify_liquid_guide,

146
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.995
so definitely open that up,

147
00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:17.390
have a read, you don't have to read the whole thing.

148
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.530
I definitely recommend you skim-read once it gets to the objects,

149
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.195
but this is going to be your reference.

150
00:08:23.195 --> 00:08:26.240
Also, there are two other resources that I want to link you to,

151
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.100
and they're actually linked in the article,

152
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.795
the actual official documentation,

153
00:08:30.795 --> 00:08:35.695
so on areas where it gets in-depth from we talk about the list of attributes,

154
00:08:35.695 --> 00:08:38.375
the Liquid reference is still going to be

155
00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:42.755
a great place for you to learn all about the different objects,

156
00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:45.430
tags, and filters within Liquid,

157
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.160
so it has an incredible amount of detail, for instance,

158
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.870
if I go into,

159
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.795
let's say the product object,

160
00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:56.750
you'll see all the attributes,

161
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.455
and you can learn all about them,

162
00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:03.665
so this article is not intended to replace the documentation,

163
00:09:03.665 --> 00:09:05.090
but it's a good starting point,

164
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.000
and I think a good overview of how it all works,

165
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.220
and it links to the documentation numerous places.

166
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.835
There's also the famous Cheat Sheet,

167
00:09:14.835 --> 00:09:17.310
so open that up in another tab,

168
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:22.175
and this right here is all of the objects, tags,

169
00:09:22.175 --> 00:09:25.020
and filters on the same page,

170
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.900
for instance, if I wanted to figure out how to get the title of a product,

171
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.695
I could Control-F product,

172
00:09:32.695 --> 00:09:37.280
and then I find this little accordion here for the product object,

173
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.225
gives me all the same things we were looking at before in the documentation,

174
00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:44.149
but in this tight little accordion,

175
00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:47.545
and then it gives me a little bit of information about that,

176
00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:53.515
then I can click Learn more and it'll take me straight back to the documentation.

177
00:09:53.515 --> 00:09:57.530
These are the resources I recommend having open,

178
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.010
or having ready while you take this class,

179
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.539
the Cheat Sheet for quick reference,

180
00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:05.320
got the documentation for anything detailed,

181
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.600
and of course my article as an overview of Shopify Liquid,

182
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.335
and if you're struggling to understand,

183
00:10:13.335 --> 00:10:15.240
what one of these things are,

184
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.175
where you can find these objects,

185
00:10:17.175 --> 00:10:20.365
my guide is what is intended to help that.

186
00:10:20.365 --> 00:10:25.670
As I've written here at the start of the article,

187
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.135
"While Shopify's Liquid Reference and the famous Cheat Sheet are great,

188
00:10:29.135 --> 00:10:31.460
I feel like there's a lot of details missing and that's why

189
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.330
I've decided to write my own documentation."

190
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.735
So as I mentioned,

191
00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:39.335
there's a few things that Shopify doesn't really talk about,

192
00:10:39.335 --> 00:10:41.074
the different types of objects,

193
00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:45.155
and where they're available in the scope of your Shopify theme,

194
00:10:45.155 --> 00:10:49.325
that is the main reason why I wrote this article, you can see here,

195
00:10:49.325 --> 00:10:51.305
not only can you learn more about objects,

196
00:10:51.305 --> 00:10:53.060
but you can also learn,

197
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.355
do they hold multiple objects?

198
00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:57.125
Where can you access them?

199
00:10:57.125 --> 00:10:58.520
Can you loop through them?

200
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.370
So just an extra reference there for you.

201
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.674
If you have any questions,

202
00:11:02.674 --> 00:11:04.520
specific questions about Liquid,

203
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.440
please check the blog post first,

204
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.425
and then if you're still struggling,

205
00:11:09.425 --> 00:11:11.660
definitely leave a comment in the discussion box.

206
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.260
Now, we mentioned JavaScript before as the way we're going

207
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.260
to do anything interactive on our Shopify theme,

208
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.490
and one way that Shopify allows us to access and

209
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.300
manipulate data from our Shopify theme using JavaScript is,

210
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.160
through the Ajax API,

211
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.915
so if I search for,

212
00:11:30.915 --> 00:11:40.020
Shopify Ajax API, you can learn more about it here.

213
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:45.415
But we're going to have a full lesson or two on the Ajax API. Don't worry.

214
00:11:45.415 --> 00:11:51.805
Just making you aware that we have an API for doing client-side request as well.

215
00:11:51.805 --> 00:11:54.070
The other code you're going to write when you're programming

216
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.420
shopify themes is CSS or SCSS.

217
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.219
You should be familiar with CSS.

218
00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:02.530
If you're not familiar with SCSS,

219
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.674
it is a form of SASS,

220
00:12:04.674 --> 00:12:09.250
which is basically a programming language for CSS.

221
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.160
It is not required to know the syntax of SASS.

222
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.700
SASS is backwards compatible with CSS and in fact,

223
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.950
once the code gets to the front end,

224
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.485
it's always compiled to CSS anyway.

225
00:12:20.485 --> 00:12:23.950
If you want to put in CSS specifically in here,

226
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.650
you can do so as normal but,

227
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.420
if you know how to use SASS,

228
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.220
you can use it as well.

229
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.545
For those of you who do know how to use SASS,

230
00:12:32.545 --> 00:12:36.955
one warning is that shopify uses an older version of SASS.

231
00:12:36.955 --> 00:12:40.150
I believe it's 3.3 or something like that.

232
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.120
It just means that all of the features of the latest version of

233
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.545
SASS won't be available to you when you're developing shopify themes.

234
00:12:47.545 --> 00:12:50.830
If you come across anything a little bit weird, that's breaking,

235
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.959
that is perfectly fine syntax,

236
00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:57.280
it might be because you're using an older version of SASS.

237
00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.320
Another warning there. Don't worry.

238
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.195
If you don't know anything about SASS,

239
00:13:01.195 --> 00:13:03.220
CSS is totally fine.

240
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.255
The final syntax that you'll have to get used to with shopify themes,

241
00:13:07.255 --> 00:13:08.680
of course we've got Liquid,

242
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.060
we've got JavaScripts, and we've CSS/SCSS.

243
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.570
But you'll also see here we've got JSON files.

244
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.555
If I open up settings_schema.json,

245
00:13:19.555 --> 00:13:25.000
this is JavaScript Object Notation, aka JSON.

246
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.050
It's just a way of easily presenting data.

247
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:34.030
It mimics the structure of a JavaScript object but it has some differences.

248
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.075
You can read more about JSON on Google,

249
00:13:37.075 --> 00:13:39.325
but it's quite simple to understand.

250
00:13:39.325 --> 00:13:42.280
Right here we have an array opening up,

251
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.770
and then inside we have an object.

252
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.665
If we wanted to write another object in here,

253
00:13:47.665 --> 00:13:54.610
we would do so like this and we can give it keys and values here.

254
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.120
All the keys need to be with a double quote.

255
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.860
That's one of the key differences with JSON and any strings obviously with quotes as

256
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:09.450
well unless we are putting in a number which we don't need quotes for.

257
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:17.350
Alright. The areas that you'll see JSON in these settings_schema.json file,

258
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:26.320
the settings_ data.json file and your locale files, en.default.json.

259
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.560
Again, we're going to go over JSON and how that all

260
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.715
works with these various files in a later video. Don't worry about that.

261
00:14:33.715 --> 00:14:38.050
Just giving you a quick overview before we jump into the liquid stuff.

262
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:42.850
That pretty much covers all the areas of your Shopify theme.

263
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.955
You should know about themes structure from the last class.

264
00:14:45.955 --> 00:14:48.580
We've got layout, templates, sections,

265
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.210
and snippets for structuring our shopify theme.

266
00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:56.725
Then we've got our assets which hold the CSS and JavaScript,

267
00:14:56.725 --> 00:15:00.490
config which holds data and the settings that we're

268
00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.660
able to change and locales for storing language.

269
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.625
The final thing I need to mention in

270
00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:11.545
this introductory video is something that's very important to Shopify Theme Programming,

271
00:15:11.545 --> 00:15:14.500
and that is the idea of templates and scope.

272
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:21.145
If we go and preview our theme and navigate to certain pages,

273
00:15:21.145 --> 00:15:25.435
you can see our template structure in the URL structure.

274
00:15:25.435 --> 00:15:27.790
Right now we're on the root domain.

275
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:32.095
Don't be confused about this little extra attribute there.

276
00:15:32.095 --> 00:15:33.370
But we're on the root domain,

277
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.575
which is the index template.

278
00:15:35.575 --> 00:15:37.480
If we go to here,

279
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.175
you can see that the URL changes to collections/all.

280
00:15:42.175 --> 00:15:45.565
This means we're on the collection template.

281
00:15:45.565 --> 00:15:48.640
If I change the actual collection that we're looking

282
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.885
at to one I have in my store called featured collection,

283
00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:55.060
you can see everything looks the same,

284
00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.720
It's just the title of the collection that gets displayed

285
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.785
here and the actual products that show up on the page is different.

286
00:16:02.785 --> 00:16:07.240
All of this is controlled by the one collection template.

287
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.280
If I click on any one of these products,

288
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.785
you'll see that we get products and then the name of the product in handle form,

289
00:16:14.785 --> 00:16:16.690
we'll talk more about handles later,

290
00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.895
gets added to the URL.

291
00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:22.465
Now we know where in the product template.

292
00:16:22.465 --> 00:16:28.825
If I go back to my collection page and I click on this product,

293
00:16:28.825 --> 00:16:31.210
you'll see it shows up pretty much

294
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:35.890
the exact same way as the other product because it uses the same template.

295
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.325
How this looks in our code is,

296
00:16:39.325 --> 00:16:41.275
we go into our templates here,

297
00:16:41.275 --> 00:16:48.650
and here is the code that will show up for every single collection page.

298
00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:54.760
The reference to collection here really depends on what collection you're on.

299
00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:00.160
But it's completely dynamic so that any collection you're on gets fed into here through

300
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.520
the collection object and you can manipulate whatever collection gets

301
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.315
passed in the same way you would another collection.

302
00:17:07.315 --> 00:17:11.650
When you're on the product page,

303
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.605
you are on the product template.

304
00:17:14.605 --> 00:17:18.160
It's the same code for every product that

305
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.610
gets displayed on your website unless you use alternate templates,

306
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.575
which we talked about in the last class,

307
00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:28.750
but essentially, everything that will change on the page is the dynamic content

308
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:34.105
and that is brought in here with this product object.

309
00:17:34.105 --> 00:17:39.370
I talk about this in the article I call templates specific scope.

310
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.710
If we scroll down,

311
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.425
I talk about the objects that can be accessed from

312
00:17:44.425 --> 00:17:47.320
anywhere in your theme as global objects.

313
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.500
If you know the actual name of your product,

314
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.585
you can access it from anywhere in your theme by using its handle.

315
00:17:55.585 --> 00:18:00.220
The same can be said for pages, blogs, articles, images.

316
00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.295
Images is through the file name there.

317
00:18:03.295 --> 00:18:09.085
But then you get to template specific variables if you scroll down,

318
00:18:09.085 --> 00:18:11.905
template specific objects rather.

319
00:18:11.905 --> 00:18:16.480
These objects are available when you're in the respective template.

320
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.370
If you're in the product template,

321
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.845
you have access to the product object

322
00:18:20.845 --> 00:18:23.845
and that product object is whatever product you're viewing,

323
00:18:23.845 --> 00:18:26.635
and you can see that from the URL.

324
00:18:26.635 --> 00:18:28.660
We are looking at black leather bag.

325
00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.935
When we do things with the product object in the product template,

326
00:18:32.935 --> 00:18:35.290
we're looking at that black leather bag.

327
00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.560
The templates that we have here all

328
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.680
have their own objects which should be labeled the same.

329
00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.190
In the collection template, we have access to the collection object.

330
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:50.110
In the blog template we have access to the blog object.

331
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.600
Templates right here, and this is something we'll

332
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.680
get more into coding templates and layouts in the next video,

333
00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:03.100
but templates is basically the different groups of pages that show up in your website.

334
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.855
Sections very powerful and snippets great for reusing code.

335
00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:11.545
We'll talk about them in the lesson after the next one.

336
00:19:11.545 --> 00:19:16.615
But I think I've talked at length already about Shopify Liquid.

337
00:19:16.615 --> 00:19:19.465
Again, these are all great references.

338
00:19:19.465 --> 00:19:22.795
I don't want to go through the entire document because it's huge.

339
00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:24.130
But in the next video,

340
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.295
we're going to jump straight into coding

341
00:19:27.295 --> 00:19:32.680
