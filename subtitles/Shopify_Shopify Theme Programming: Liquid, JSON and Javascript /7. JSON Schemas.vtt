00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
In this lesson, we're going to learn all about JSON.

2
00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:07.425
JSON is a popular way of representing data and Shopify themes,

3
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:12.510
the way you represent all of your data and your Shopify theme is through JSON files.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.230
We saw in the last video we've got language file here,

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.435
which is stored in JSON.

6
00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:22.580
We can also edit that through the theme language editor,

7
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.770
which we also saw in the last video.

8
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.390
This is quite basic.

9
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.145
We have access to the keys and attributes within that object,

10
00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:35.060
and we can just edit this directly through here,

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.395
or we can edit it on the actual data file itself.

12
00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:44.570
What I want to discuss more in depth in this lesson is JSON Schemas.

13
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.004
If I click out to that and I go into settings_schema,

14
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:53.320
we can see the schema for our entire website.

15
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.015
Now, I know we haven't looked at this just yet,

16
00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:57.605
but we have of course,

17
00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:03.215
looked at schemas briefly as it relates to individual sections.

18
00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:06.860
Right here, the schema that we see here is very

19
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.880
similar to how it operates here in our settings_schema.JSON.

20
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.785
If you want to learn more about JSON itself,

21
00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.695
stands for JavaScript Object Notation.

22
00:01:19.695 --> 00:01:22.715
It's a way of representing data that looks

23
00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:26.149
similar to how you would represent data in JavaScript,

24
00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.120
but it's not exactly the same.

25
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.730
Some major differences include having double quotes around the property names.

26
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.780
But if you want to learn more about JSON,

27
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.565
a quick Google search,

28
00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:44.820
it's just J-S-O-N, and you have a world of information open up to you about JSON.

29
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.080
It's quite simple.

30
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.260
It's not summing to study

31
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
a whole course on unless you really want to get in depth with it.

32
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.955
But for our purposes,

33
00:01:52.955 --> 00:01:56.070
all we need to understand in

34
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.650
JSON schema we've got arrays just like we would in JavaScript,

35
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.475
and then an object is represented by these curly brackets.

36
00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:08.315
So as we saw with the language file,

37
00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.850
this is the object overall.

38
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.095
Then inside this object we can target the general object.

39
00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:17.080
Then when we're inside the general object,

40
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.945
we can grab the "404" object and then grab attributes or nested objects within that.

41
00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:27.905
We saw that coming into our output here.

42
00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:29.870
Going into the locales,

43
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.580
picking out the general object,

44
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.755
going into the nested "404" object and grabbing the title of that.

45
00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:40.640
All right, so that's a little bit on JSON and the syntax behind it.

46
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.150
But let's talk more about schemas and how it all works in Shopify.

47
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.445
We saw the schema as it relates to specific sections in previous videos.

48
00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:56.070
But I want to show you settings_schema.JSON.

49
00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.875
If we go back to our customizer and we go on any page,

50
00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:05.050
you see we've got sections in the first tab here.

51
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.620
We can see our sections as we saw before,

52
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.310
and any schemas within those sections will generate these inputs.

53
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.670
But there's also this other menu called theme settings.

54
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.250
Here we can place groups of settings that we can access throughout our theme.

55
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.960
There are some limitations though.

56
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.890
One of the features of a settings in sections is that we can have blocks

57
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.130
which we'll see very soon in the overall theme settings.

58
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.770
We can't do blocks.

59
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.855
That's one limitation, but otherwise they work pretty much the same.

60
00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:42.185
Let's go in and show you an example.

61
00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:49.565
After this object, I'm going to create a new object and give this a name of,

62
00:03:49.565 --> 00:03:52.935
let's just say, general styles.

63
00:03:52.935 --> 00:03:57.190
This is like how you would define a section as well.

64
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.425
Then just like we would in a sections schema,

65
00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:04.000
we define a settings array.

66
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.900
Inside this settings array,

67
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.605
we can create any types of inputs that we want.

68
00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:13.070
For this video, I've already loaded up the two areas of

69
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.375
the Shopify documentation that will help you with creating these JSON Schemas.

70
00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:22.960
The first one is: @themes/development/sections.

71
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.055
The title is themed sections.

72
00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:30.090
This one is handy for learning about how to structure your schema.

73
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.610
You've got the different tags we saw presets in an earlier video.

74
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.450
We will also learn about blocks here today as well.

75
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.240
Over here in configuring theme settings,

76
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.285
it's frustrating that they put it in a separate page.

77
00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:49.675
But this is the page where you'll learn about all the different input settings,

78
00:04:49.675 --> 00:04:51.905
so text, text area,

79
00:04:51.905 --> 00:04:55.250
image picker, radio, select checkbox range.

80
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.800
Those are the basic ones and then they've got

81
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.490
some advanced ones down here, I believe, yes.

82
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.329
We can create inputs for color, fonts, collections,

83
00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:07.040
products, blogs, pages, links,

84
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.905
lists, URLs, lots of different stuff.

85
00:05:09.905 --> 00:05:15.095
If you want to see if there is something that you can make a user input,

86
00:05:15.095 --> 00:05:18.185
chances are it's going to be in here.

87
00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:20.270
Going back to here,

88
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.505
we need to create a setting.

89
00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:26.900
What I'm going to do just for demonstration purposes is create

90
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.075
a setting for the color of links. Let's just say.

91
00:05:32.075 --> 00:05:36.300
I'm going to use the color picker.

92
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.270
Let's just copy the example.

93
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:47.760
I'll go into here and replace my empty object with the object from the documentation.

94
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.335
The type is already set is going to be color.

95
00:05:50.335 --> 00:05:52.690
We just need to give that an ID.

96
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.855
I'm going to call this link color,

97
00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:58.480
and the label is what gets shown to the user.

98
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.250
I'm going to call it link color.

99
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.465
I'm using the American spelling just to be consistent and the default value,

100
00:06:07.465 --> 00:06:08.740
we'll just say blue.

101
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.690
This one here info allows us to put in an extra little bit of text.

102
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.120
I don't think that it's necessary in this instance,

103
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.970
but just to show you what it does for when you do need it,

104
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.650
I'm going to write a description here.

105
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.900
This is for the link color.

106
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.895
If I save that,

107
00:06:28.895 --> 00:06:31.205
you can see we've got an error.

108
00:06:31.205 --> 00:06:35.390
Setting with link color default must be a CSS color.

109
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.265
We can't use blue,

110
00:06:37.265 --> 00:06:38.780
it has to be a HEX value,

111
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.025
so let me just do black. Try that.

112
00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:47.685
Must be a CSS color.

113
00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:51.885
There we go. Not the best at running hex codes.

114
00:06:51.885 --> 00:06:53.130
I usually just look them up.

115
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.565
All right, but now we've got this hex code which represents black.

116
00:06:57.565 --> 00:07:03.785
If we go into our customizer now and refresh the page everything looks the same,

117
00:07:03.785 --> 00:07:05.900
but we can go in here.

118
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.145
Now we've got this section for general styles.

119
00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:12.615
Click on that, and we have link color.

120
00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:18.215
The default value has been set to #000 and it's filled in the other zeros.

121
00:07:18.215 --> 00:07:23.650
We can go in, change this to that blue color and hit "save."

122
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.370
Now just like we did with the settings in the section schema,

123
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.275
this isn't going to do anything unless we actually reference that value.

124
00:07:33.275 --> 00:07:37.135
That is what, of course the ID is for.

125
00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:43.820
Let's go ahead and make all the links in our theme according to this link color.

126
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.585
Now, where we should put a style that's going to be on

127
00:07:47.585 --> 00:07:53.940
every page of our theme is in our global CSS file.

128
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.610
But what we want to do is reference liquid in this instance because we're going to

129
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:04.295
need to access the settings object in liquid in order to access this value.

130
00:08:04.295 --> 00:08:08.525
One feature of Shopify themes that you may not realize

131
00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:13.475
is that you can use liquid on your CSS files as well.

132
00:08:13.475 --> 00:08:23.080
What I'm going to do is change this file name and add.liquid to the end of it.

133
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.310
Then, I'll hit ''Done''.

134
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.450
Now it's going to have a ridiculously long extension, but, oh, well.

135
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:37.750
Now what I'm going to do is target all links using CSS,

136
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:43.915
and change the color attribute based off what is set in here.

137
00:08:43.915 --> 00:08:45.205
As I just mentioned,

138
00:08:45.205 --> 00:08:48.835
the way to do that is through the global settings object.

139
00:08:48.835 --> 00:08:52.270
I can create an output tag,

140
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.660
access my settings object,

141
00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:01.855
and then I'm going to go into the setting with the ID of link color.

142
00:09:01.855 --> 00:09:06.235
I'm going to put in link color here,

143
00:09:06.235 --> 00:09:10.510
and then I'm going to close it with a semicolon.

144
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:15.070
Now, we might actually have to change the name of this inner theme.liquid,

145
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.480
but let's go and have a look and see if that works now.

146
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.930
I'm going to bring up the DevTools.

147
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.690
There's no errors in the console.

148
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.675
Let's go down to where we bring in the link.

149
00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:36.325
If I open the CSS file,

150
00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:37.675
open in a new tab,

151
00:09:37.675 --> 00:09:41.320
you'll see that we have our CSS,

152
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.030
but instead of the liquid tag,

153
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.270
which remember gets all generated on the server side,

154
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.250
we have the actual output.

155
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.540
Just like we calculate liquid on the back end with all of these,

156
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.059
and it just spits out HTML and CSS,

157
00:09:55.059 --> 00:09:57.205
we've got the same thing happening here.

158
00:09:57.205 --> 00:09:59.680
We can put a.liquid at the end of this,

159
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.165
then Shopify those to pause any liquid within here.

160
00:10:04.165 --> 00:10:06.685
Then by the time it gets to the front end,

161
00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:11.665
as we saw, it is just a css.scss file.

162
00:10:11.665 --> 00:10:13.239
There's no liquid extension,

163
00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:20.170
and it calculates all of the liquid and puts in the actual value. Very cool.

164
00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.490
So we can programmatically affect our style sheet.

165
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.060
I'm going to go back into the customizer here and let's

166
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.750
see if we can get our link tags changing.

167
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.245
I'm going to refresh the page to make sure that everything's current.

168
00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:36.970
Go into general styles,

169
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.300
and change this to something really obvious, like red.

170
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.010
I'm going to hit ''Save'',

171
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.410
and right now it isn't updating.

172
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.860
Let's have a look inside theme,

173
00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.285
oh, wait. Here we go.

174
00:10:49.285 --> 00:10:51.715
Now we can see that by default,

175
00:10:51.715 --> 00:10:54.040
all the links are red,

176
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.100
because we just set that right here in our general settings.

177
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.780
If we refresh the customizer,

178
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.850
we should get the same result here as well.

179
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.165
Maybe it's caching a little bit.

180
00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:09.355
Not sure why it is not affecting in the customizer,

181
00:11:09.355 --> 00:11:13.990
but is definitely affecting it on the front end here.

182
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:19.975
That's a great example of creating theme settings and putting it in here.

183
00:11:19.975 --> 00:11:21.625
This is for anything general,

184
00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:24.369
link colors, heading colors,

185
00:11:24.369 --> 00:11:27.070
fonts, anything like that that you want to

186
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:30.265
affect the whole theme would go in theme settings.

187
00:11:30.265 --> 00:11:35.125
But most commonly, you're going to be setting settings in your section.

188
00:11:35.125 --> 00:11:42.130
I'm going to just go back and change this because it doesn't look too good being red.

189
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.930
Hit ''Save'' on that,

190
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.490
and go into here and refresh the page. There we go.

191
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.070
Now we've got the color that we set.

192
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.795
Cool. All right.

193
00:11:55.795 --> 00:12:03.820
Now let's go into one of our sections and let's look at the featured-collection section.

194
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.560
The first thing we want to do is allow the user to actually choose

195
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.000
the collection that gets featured rather than hard coding it in.

196
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.810
I'm going to go in my settings here, open that up.

197
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:22.810
As always, I'm going to go in and check what inputs I have available.

198
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.925
Remember we saw one for collection.

199
00:12:24.925 --> 00:12:26.785
I'm going to click on that one.

200
00:12:26.785 --> 00:12:31.045
Here we've got an example which I can just copy word for word.

201
00:12:31.045 --> 00:12:32.725
I'm doing this fast,

202
00:12:32.725 --> 00:12:34.540
because I don't want to get caught up on the theory.

203
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.900
But if you want to read about what we're doing here,

204
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.690
it's all on the documentation.

205
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:49.070
Go back, replace our empty object here with the attributes that we need to edit.

206
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.970
The type is already set for us.

207
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:55.035
I'm going to change the ID to collection because it just makes the most sense.

208
00:12:55.035 --> 00:12:57.420
Call the label collection,

209
00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.150
and we really don't need an info line here,

210
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.400
because it's quite simple.

211
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.540
Then up here, we can set the collection to,

212
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:11.790
instead of featured-collection, we can actually reference the settings.

213
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.885
So I'm going to grab this section object,

214
00:13:14.885 --> 00:13:18.715
go into its settings and find collection.

215
00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:21.325
Then I am going to save.

216
00:13:21.325 --> 00:13:23.935
Now, this will break it because we don't have

217
00:13:23.935 --> 00:13:27.925
a default set that then we can easily go and update it.

218
00:13:27.925 --> 00:13:34.735
If I go into the homepage where this featured collection section is,

219
00:13:34.735 --> 00:13:38.095
it says no matches because we haven't actually inserted anything.

220
00:13:38.095 --> 00:13:41.290
Now the content's not showing up.

221
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.590
Let's have a look. What have we done wrong here?

222
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.300
Everything's looking fine.

223
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.155
Maybe we forgot to update or refresh our customizer.

224
00:13:50.155 --> 00:13:51.715
Let's do that right now.

225
00:13:51.715 --> 00:13:55.285
We should still get no matches because we haven't set a collection yet.

226
00:13:55.285 --> 00:13:59.635
But now we can see that collection is now an input.

227
00:13:59.635 --> 00:14:02.140
Now we can, as the user,

228
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.375
have this lovely user interface to select a collection that we want to bring in here.

229
00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:09.550
Then as we select it,

230
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.460
it should be used by our section.

231
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.785
So I'm going to hit ''Save'' and we've still got an issue.

232
00:14:17.785 --> 00:14:23.215
Let me go and check on the front end if it's erroring as well.

233
00:14:23.215 --> 00:14:27.595
No matches. So let's go back again, have a look.

234
00:14:27.595 --> 00:14:32.830
What I think we're experiencing here is an issue I find with Shopify themes,

235
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:37.405
where calling a resource object gives us its name,

236
00:14:37.405 --> 00:14:39.520
but not the object itself.

237
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.005
Just to confirm this,

238
00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:43.330
I'm going to create

239
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:48.685
an output tag and see if we just get the collection name if I put our collection.

240
00:14:48.685 --> 00:14:52.240
I suspect that this will definitely be the case.

241
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.475
If I refresh the page,

242
00:14:54.475 --> 00:14:58.090
you can see the handle of the collection shows up.

243
00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:01.360
If we were actually accessing the collection object,

244
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.265
we would get a different result.

245
00:15:03.265 --> 00:15:06.415
This is a frustrating thing within Shopify.

246
00:15:06.415 --> 00:15:10.765
You would think that if we linked a collection here and then we code it,

247
00:15:10.765 --> 00:15:12.670
we would get the collection object,

248
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:16.240
but instead, we get the collection handle.

249
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.380
The way we can get around this is by using the collections global.

250
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:29.290
I'm going to go "collections" and then I can use this dynamic value as the handle.

251
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.200
Maybe this looks a bit complicated, but trust me,

252
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.245
it's not as complicated as you might think.

253
00:15:35.245 --> 00:15:40.885
This is essentially the same thing as doing featured-collection,

254
00:15:40.885 --> 00:15:43.000
which is exactly what we had before.

255
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.465
We just replaced that handle with the handle we get from the user down here.

256
00:15:49.465 --> 00:15:53.640
I'm going to hit ''Save'' and see if we get a different result.

257
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.600
Now you can see that we're actually getting

258
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.910
the collection object and we're able to loop

259
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.790
through the products in that collection object.

260
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.910
Now I'm really glad we came up against that problem

261
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:09.545
because this is something that's not particularly obvious in Shopify theme programming,

262
00:16:09.545 --> 00:16:12.425
and it's something that trips me up quite a bit as well.

263
00:16:12.425 --> 00:16:15.230
But from experience, I knew that

264
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:20.330
sometimes you expect an object but get something else back in Shopify.

265
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.110
Remember when we put this out before we got the collection handle.

266
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:29.270
Let's now put out collection and see what we get instead.

267
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.750
This is what we were expecting to get when we

268
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.185
put out this object or what we thought was an object.

269
00:16:36.185 --> 00:16:38.690
If we go back and refresh the page,

270
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.485
we can see words come up called CollectionDrop.

271
00:16:42.485 --> 00:16:45.380
Now this is special terminology in liquid,

272
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.010
which basically says this is the collection object.

273
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.810
So if it was an empty object,

274
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.175
it would say empty drop.

275
00:16:52.175 --> 00:16:53.600
If it was a product object,

276
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.235
it would say product drop.

277
00:16:55.235 --> 00:17:01.520
Unfortunately, we can't output the whole object as we would maybe in JavaScript.

278
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.255
It just tells us that this is a collection object.

279
00:17:05.255 --> 00:17:09.110
So now we know because before,

280
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:12.230
remember we took the collection

281
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:17.090
here from our section settings and we outputted that as well.

282
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:20.135
If I break those up with a break tag,

283
00:17:20.135 --> 00:17:23.840
you can see that the first one is

284
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.685
the handle of the collection and the second one is the actual collection object.

285
00:17:28.685 --> 00:17:31.910
Okay, I probably went too much off on a tangent there,

286
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:37.250
but something that really trip you up in Shopify theme programming and something

287
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:42.740
I've learned the hard way is when you select resources in your customizer,

288
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.865
sometimes you just get the handle and not the actual object.

289
00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:50.480
At that point, you have to actually use a global,

290
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.815
reference the handle, and then pick it off the actual global object.

291
00:17:54.815 --> 00:17:56.450
So that's what we've done here,

292
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.655
and we've got it working.

293
00:17:58.655 --> 00:18:01.310
So now the user can select

294
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:05.495
what collection gets shown in that featured collection section.

295
00:18:05.495 --> 00:18:08.030
Okay. If I refresh the page here,

296
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.190
we should get the same result.

297
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:14.540
Yeah. So I could add any kind of other settings here.

298
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.015
I could show the sale price,

299
00:18:17.015 --> 00:18:19.805
show wherever it's sold out on not, show vendor.

300
00:18:19.805 --> 00:18:26.345
Basically customize pretty much anything about this section for these section settings.

301
00:18:26.345 --> 00:18:28.700
So that's what we do right here.

302
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.405
Okay. Now, the final thing to cover off with

303
00:18:32.405 --> 00:18:37.190
schemas is the question of where does the data actually gets stored?

304
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.685
Remember I said all data in Shopify is stored

305
00:18:40.685 --> 00:18:44.840
in Shopify themes specifically is stored in JSO N format.

306
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.865
So where do we find that?

307
00:18:46.865 --> 00:18:49.325
Well, all the data for your Shopify theme,

308
00:18:49.325 --> 00:18:53.060
gets stored in settings_data.json,

309
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.995
regardless of where it's coming from,

310
00:18:54.995 --> 00:19:00.005
settings_schema, or it's coming from a specific section.

311
00:19:00.005 --> 00:19:04.520
So here we have schemas, and each of these.

312
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.475
The actual value that gets stored,

313
00:19:07.475 --> 00:19:08.975
all of it goes in here.

314
00:19:08.975 --> 00:19:12.095
So you can see this current object at the top,

315
00:19:12.095 --> 00:19:15.860
and in our current object we have the link color stored.

316
00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.880
Okay. So if I was to go in,

317
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.855
change that link color again. All right.

318
00:19:23.855 --> 00:19:31.050
I want you to notice that this value here is the same as that value there.

319
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.135
Now, if I change it to red again,

320
00:19:35.135 --> 00:19:39.020
I think this is a slightly different shade of red,

321
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.315
and we refresh this data file.

322
00:19:41.315 --> 00:19:44.550
I want you to look at what happens to the data file.

323
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:52.085
As you can see, the value of link color has changed in the data file,

324
00:19:52.085 --> 00:19:55.595
and just like we did in the language file,

325
00:19:55.595 --> 00:20:00.800
we can actually change this value and it will change in the user interface as well.

326
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.285
This is the back-end data that is linking to the user interface.

327
00:20:05.285 --> 00:20:08.390
So this will change it in the customizer and

328
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.825
change the value wherever it's cold in the theme.

329
00:20:11.825 --> 00:20:17.615
So if you go in here, the link color is back to black because I changed it in this data.

330
00:20:17.615 --> 00:20:21.259
Now this is important because whenever you're migrating

331
00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:26.075
themes or copying themes or trying to merge two themes together,

332
00:20:26.075 --> 00:20:29.600
you need to take care of this data file.

333
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.150
I'm not going to talk too much about staging because I do

334
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.820
have a video on YouTube about that.

335
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.400
Just search for Shopify theme development

336
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.950
on YouTube and hopefully you'll find my channel.

337
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.495
If I'm doing my SEO, right.

338
00:20:41.495 --> 00:20:44.845
But this is something just to be aware of with your data file.

339
00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:46.270
It all gets stored here,

340
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.580
so be very careful with the data file.

341
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.530
Try to avoid touching this.

342
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:55.090
But if you do need to merge data from two themes, this is how you would do it.

343
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.340
All right, with that side note out of the way,

344
00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:03.295
I want to draw your attention to a few more things in this settings_json document,

345
00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:06.415
and that is we have this section's object right here.

346
00:21:06.415 --> 00:21:09.810
Now you can see all the sections that we have.

347
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.170
We have header, collection template,

348
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:16.205
footer and this one is referenced by its ID.

349
00:21:16.205 --> 00:21:22.475
I'm not sure why it's referenced by its ID instead of its name, but regardless,

350
00:21:22.475 --> 00:21:25.220
we've got a featured collection here,

351
00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.425
and you can see in our settings,

352
00:21:27.425 --> 00:21:33.335
we have a key value of collection with the featured collection handle.

353
00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:36.005
So if I go in and change this to a different handle,

354
00:21:36.005 --> 00:21:40.865
that would update it in the selection I have here for my featured collection.

355
00:21:40.865 --> 00:21:47.480
All right, again, this is just a lovely user interface to change what's written in here.

356
00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.770
The other thing I want you to notice is the content for index array.

357
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:56.045
It takes all the IDs of the sections that are in use and puts it in here.

358
00:21:56.045 --> 00:22:01.115
So if I just remove that ID and hit "Save".

359
00:22:01.115 --> 00:22:03.320
Now when we go to our "Homepage",

360
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:09.005
that section that the ID referenced is now missing from our Homepage.

361
00:22:09.005 --> 00:22:11.720
Okay. But we can always add it back in.

362
00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.150
Add in the featured collection.

363
00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:18.590
Choose a collection that we want to feature.

364
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.480
I've just called mine featured collection.

365
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.770
Save that again, and if we refresh the data file,

366
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:33.395
you'll see that that data file in the content for index array is back in there.

367
00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:38.150
Okay. So settings_data.json stores

368
00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:42.650
all the data that's generated from all your schemas in the one place.

369
00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.035
There is of course, your locales photo,

370
00:22:45.035 --> 00:22:48.245
but this is all just for locales.

371
00:22:48.245 --> 00:22:50.660
This is separate to schemas, okay?

372
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.389
All of the settings that you set up in your settings_schema.json,

373
00:22:53.389 --> 00:22:57.395
and the schemas within your individual sections.

374
00:22:57.395 --> 00:22:59.060
All of those selections,

375
00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:03.590
the selection itself goes into this file right here,

376
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:09.650
settings_data.json, and that is basically for JSON schemas.

377
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:14.795
You've seen how to add a setting on your overall theme settings.

378
00:23:14.795 --> 00:23:16.880
So we saw that here,

379
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:23.060
and we've seen another example of inserting a particular setting into a section right

380
00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:28.865
here by allowing the user to choose what collection gets to be featured.

381
00:23:28.865 --> 00:23:33.020
Okay? Also, just to recap,

382
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:37.535
we learned about a little bit of a gotcha in Shopify Liquid.

383
00:23:37.535 --> 00:23:40.850
If you do select a resource like a collection,

384
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.535
the object value will just be a handle,

385
00:23:43.535 --> 00:23:44.900
not the object itself.

386
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:49.550
So we still need to look that up using a global object like collections,

387
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:55.760
like all products, all of the global objects you can find right here in the blog post.

388
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.985
See how, if I scroll down to "Collections".

389
00:23:58.985 --> 00:24:01.940
This one just shows you how you can loop through collections,

390
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.795
but we access a particular collection via its handle.

391
00:24:05.795 --> 00:24:09.425
You can do the same with the old products object.

392
00:24:09.425 --> 00:24:11.930
You can access a product via

393
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:16.445
its specific handle and then that becomes the product object.

394
00:24:16.445 --> 00:24:21.125
Okay. So we should be pretty clear on JSON Schemas.

395
00:24:21.125 --> 00:24:25.820
Remember, you're probably not going to know off by heart what settings to put in here.

396
00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.345
So make sure that you reference the documentation.

397
00:24:29.345 --> 00:24:33.460
This page has all the different input settings that you can put in there.

398
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.735
On this page, theme sections,

399
00:24:35.735 --> 00:24:39.425
you can learn about stuff like presets and blocks.

400
00:24:39.425 --> 00:24:41.900
Blocks is something we're going to learn about in the next video

401
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.585
where we actually create our own section.

402
00:24:44.585 --> 00:24:46.385
So I'm looking forward to that video.

403
00:24:46.385 --> 00:24:49.200
I will see you in the next one.
