00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,385
Hey students, I just wanted to jump in here before we start and make sure you're

2
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:08,745
aware of something Shopify are calling Online Store 2.0.

3
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:10,020
As you can probably tell,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,310
this video was recorded a few years after the original class was posted,

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,570
but I thought it was important to jump in here and let you know about some updates.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,165
If you know what I'm talking about here with Online Store 2.0,

7
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:23,790
feel free to skip this video.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,020
But for the rest of you,

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,210
I just need to update you on a few changes to

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,410
the online store experience since this class first went live.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,225
Just to address some of your concern students,

12
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:37,130
the content in this class is still all relevant.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,720
Liquid is still in that same form.

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,690
JSON is still used for section schemas and locales.

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,480
The JavaScript APIs I talk about in this class all still exist at the time of recording,

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,040
but we just have a new format for template files.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,965
So now templates can be of either Liquid or JSON.

18
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:57,320
We'll get further into this in the class.

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,740
You should probably by now know what a template is.

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,530
But previously, templates were coded as only

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,970
Liquid and you had to hide program in the sections.

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,605
Now, in order to allow for sections everywhere,

23
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:14,305
Shopify have enabled the use of JSON templates.

24
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:17,600
So now instead of storing Liquid directly in your template,

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,495
you store a JSON object in your template,

26
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:23,900
and that JSON object has the list of sections that

27
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,180
you can then reorder in your theme editor,

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,970
and this allows you to create re-orderable sections in all of your templates,

29
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,985
not just your homepage.

30
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:36,680
If you want to learn more about JSON templates,

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,595
I go deeper into it in Lesson 11 of the previous class.

32
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:43,940
I just added a new video in that class for you guys so you can

33
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,495
learn what JSON templates are and how to use them.

34
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:49,955
That being said, it's going to change

35
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:54,500
your development tool now if you want to use JSON templates.

36
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,085
In the next video, I mentioned Slate.

37
00:01:57,085 --> 00:02:01,580
I don't recommend you use Slate unless you're picking up a legacy project.

38
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,870
Slate is well expired now.

39
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:11,090
Shopify ended support officially for Shopify Slate back in January 2020.

40
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,120
I don't recommend you use it unless of course,

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,330
you have to because you're taking on a legacy project.

42
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,750
But even then, I would recommend migrating off of Slate.

43
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,905
In the last video,

44
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:24,380
I mentioned a tool called Theme Kit,

45
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,355
but there's also a new tool now called Shopify CLI,

46
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:32,480
and it's important to note Shopify CLI here

47
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,105
because it's the tool that you're going to have to use if you want to use JSON templates.

48
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:43,440
For whatever reason, Theme Kit hasn't been adapted to work with the new JSON templates.

49
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,800
So if you want to use JSON templates,

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,445
you're going to have to use Shopify CLI.

51
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:53,540
Those are the main changes to note before we get into the class.

52
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,325
As I said, Liquid is still the same,

53
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:56,660
JSON is still the same,

54
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,075
JavaScript API still exist.

55
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:01,820
The latest change from Shopify is that

56
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,020
template files can now be of either Liquid or JSON.

57
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,580
Again, to learn more about Online Store 2.0,

58
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,605
you can check out the three new videos I added to the Shopify theme development class,

59
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:14,690
I mentioned the JSON Schemas one.

60
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,850
If you want to learn about the CLI,

61
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,565
that's in Lesson 6, I believe,

62
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:23,625
so Lesson 6 of my previous class,

63
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:28,625
and there's also an intro to Online Store 2.0 in that class as well.

64
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,540
I also have a Online Store 2.0 playlist on YouTube

65
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,535
that you can check out for more information about Online Store 2.0.

66
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:38,255
But with that being said,

67
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:45,210
let's return to the class and learn how we can program in Shopify theme development.
