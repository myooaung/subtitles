00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.464
In this lesson we're going to be focused on programming,

2
00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:05.715
layout and template files.

3
00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:12.075
The template that we're going to be focusing on is the collection.liquid template.

4
00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:14.820
The reason why I decided to use this one is

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.195
because products are central to any Shopify store,

6
00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:20.205
or at least should be, because essentially

7
00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:23.640
an e-commerce store is set up to sell products.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.945
Products are the most important resource in your Shopify store, most likely.

9
00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:34.175
One of the ways that people can browse

10
00:00:34.175 --> 00:00:37.025
through different products is through a collection.

11
00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:43.310
We can see here a pretty simple loop here for the collection template,

12
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.650
but there is still a bit going on here.

13
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.520
What I want to do is simplify this and tackle this line by line.

14
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.120
First of all, I'm going to preview this in a new tab.

15
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.200
We can go to here and we can make sure we're in

16
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.850
a collection template by checking that collections is in the URL.

17
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.815
Now we have our front end,

18
00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:13.335
how it looks with our template that we're editing.

19
00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:16.610
The first thing I'm going to do is remove pagination

20
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.055
and strip this down to just a simple loop.

21
00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:24.530
Pagination is handy, but I don't want to confuse you straight up,

22
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.365
so let's just remove it for now.

23
00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:30.890
Let's see what happens when we do that.

24
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.395
If I refresh the page,

25
00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:39.125
you'll see now every product in our store is showing on the one page.

26
00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:42.050
Usually you don't want to do that because you could have

27
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.110
hundreds or thousands of products and that would take forever to load one page.

28
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.990
Pagination is very handy,

29
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.560
just removing it for simplicity sake.

30
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.680
Now to make it even simpler,

31
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.665
I'm going to remove that code and strip it down even further.

32
00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:06.175
We just got this loop now and let's have a look at how that looks on the front end.

33
00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:07.925
Refreshing the page.

34
00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:13.340
You can see we now just have a list of products with a link to view them.

35
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.950
If I click on the first one, awesome sneakers,

36
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.230
I'm now on the product template looking at this product, awesome sneakers.

37
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.610
But we're focused on this collections loop here.

38
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.765
Let's break down what we got going on here.

39
00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:31.520
In liquid, as I've mentioned before,

40
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.665
we have two types of tags.

41
00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:36.650
There's actually three, and we can put in

42
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.445
a dash here and here and that just reduces whitespace,

43
00:02:41.445 --> 00:02:43.925
it doesn't actually change the functionality at all.

44
00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:45.800
I won't worry too much about that.

45
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.470
But essentially we just have two different types of tags,

46
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.225
the output tag and the logic tag.

47
00:02:52.225 --> 00:02:56.165
When we just want to straight out output something to the page,

48
00:02:56.165 --> 00:02:57.680
we just use the output tag.

49
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.215
Right now we are taking an attribute on the collection object of title.

50
00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:07.860
Here you can see, this is the collections title.

51
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.365
Now it's a bit different with the old collection because it's an auto generated

52
00:03:12.365 --> 00:03:17.659
collection by Shopify but if we go to an actual collection that I created,

53
00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:23.555
featured collection, you can now see that the title of that collection is right here.

54
00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:26.555
If I was to go back into my back end, change that,

55
00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:30.850
it would change it here and anywhere else we reference collection.title.

56
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.245
Then going into a loop now,

57
00:03:34.245 --> 00:03:39.050
what I'm doing is I'm taking the products attribute of the collection,

58
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.420
which gives me access to all the products within

59
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.305
that collection and I'm looping through them using

60
00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:49.820
the word product as my hook in order to

61
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.760
access the different attributes of that particular product.

62
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.335
This word could be any word I wanted it to be,

63
00:03:57.335 --> 00:03:58.820
but product makes sense.

64
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.110
It makes it more readable.

65
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.320
For product in collection.products,

66
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.610
we're going to do this for every single product.

67
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.060
Now, something that exists in for loops in Liquid,

68
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.835
which I don't know if it exists in any other language,

69
00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:16.550
is you can actually have an else statement.

70
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.215
This is if collection.products is empty,

71
00:04:21.215 --> 00:04:25.100
it won't loop through it and instead it'll output this.

72
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.715
The else in this instance is for when the objects that you're looping through is empty.

73
00:04:30.715 --> 00:04:34.760
It's just a shorthand for if I was to put an if statement up here,

74
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.070
checking if the length of this was bigger than zero,

75
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.185
and then if not putting that out,

76
00:04:39.185 --> 00:04:43.790
we can save ourselves some code and write it this way.

77
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.285
For every product in collection.products we're going to start

78
00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:53.045
a div and inside this div we're going to have a link.

79
00:04:53.045 --> 00:04:56.630
For the actual address of that link,

80
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.565
we're going to put in the product.url,

81
00:05:00.565 --> 00:05:02.925
so the link to the actual product.

82
00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:06.345
Then we have got this pipe here.

83
00:05:06.345 --> 00:05:11.345
This pipe here is what defines a filter in Liquid.

84
00:05:11.345 --> 00:05:13.140
We can remove this,

85
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.760
it's going to work pretty much just as well without that.

86
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.330
First of all, let's look at it with that filter.

87
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.010
If I go and inspect here and I look at the URL,

88
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.135
you can see that the URL has

89
00:05:28.135 --> 00:05:33.295
featured-collection and then on the ends, products/awesome-sneakers.

90
00:05:33.295 --> 00:05:37.609
But if we remove that code and hit Save,

91
00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:41.330
that filter will not apply and the URL we'll get

92
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.770
instead is just products/awesome-sneakers.

93
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.255
This filter we have here within collection,

94
00:05:50.255 --> 00:05:54.500
it just makes the URL of the product append to

95
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.270
the URL that we're currently on for

96
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.955
this collection instead of cutting out the collection.

97
00:05:59.955 --> 00:06:05.735
That's handy for if we want to have logic on the product template and we can

98
00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:08.990
reference the collection that we navigated to

99
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.790
because a product could be part of many different collections.

100
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.815
Going back to the collection page here,

101
00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:17.765
the next part, very simple.

102
00:06:17.765 --> 00:06:20.605
We just output the product title.

103
00:06:20.605 --> 00:06:22.545
You can see that here,

104
00:06:22.545 --> 00:06:26.885
we've got a link and inside it's the product title and

105
00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:31.295
the a href is the link to that product.

106
00:06:31.295 --> 00:06:32.500
Very simple stuff.

107
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.390
Let's add in the next line that we had here.

108
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.130
I'm going to add in all of them,

109
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.335
remove all of them except one,

110
00:06:41.335 --> 00:06:43.545
and hit Save on that.

111
00:06:43.545 --> 00:06:47.880
What we've got here is we're now outputting the price as well.

112
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.960
Very basic product.price and we're using another filter called money,

113
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.680
which formats it in a nice currency format.

114
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.095
If I was to remove that filter again,

115
00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:02.220
you'll see it'll still work.

116
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.335
Let's refresh the page.

117
00:07:04.335 --> 00:07:10.760
You'll get the price of all these products coming up in the pure number form.

118
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.590
In Shopify, the pure number form of a price includes the cents.

119
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.440
You can see here this is going to be 8,000 cents,

120
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.085
this is 11,000 cents so on, so forth.

121
00:07:23.085 --> 00:07:25.260
Obviously that's not going to look that great to

122
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.790
the end-user so what we usually do is filter it with

123
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.730
the money filter and that's going to transform

124
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:37.085
that number into a much nicer formatted currency format.

125
00:07:37.085 --> 00:07:43.200
Now we can see that 8,000 cents becomes $80 and we've got those decimals.

126
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.645
We can use other money filters to filter out the decimals if we want,

127
00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:50.030
but money is the standard one.

128
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:56.040
Let's add in the next line and remove the final line.

129
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.460
Now we've added in an unless statement.

130
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.230
The unless tag is basically the opposite of the if tag.

131
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.140
It reads in a different way.

132
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.330
Unless the product is available,

133
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.755
we're going to do this.

134
00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:12.550
We can easily transform this into an if statement,

135
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.230
we just have to change the condition here.

136
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.270
I think in this instance it makes more sense that

137
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.445
in terms of understanding the code to make this an if statement.

138
00:08:21.445 --> 00:08:27.440
I'm going to remove the unless words and what we need to do here,

139
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.054
if product available is false,

140
00:08:31.054 --> 00:08:37.020
or we could also do if product available is not true.

141
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.635
Let's just do false.

142
00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:45.545
We need to do for comparison double equal signs or triple equal signs,

143
00:08:45.545 --> 00:08:50.105
because a single equal sign is for assignment, not for comparison.

144
00:08:50.105 --> 00:08:55.085
Remember that guys, that's quite a common basic beginner mistake.

145
00:08:55.085 --> 00:08:58.940
I think this reads a lot nicer if product available is false,

146
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.755
as in the product is not available,

147
00:09:00.755 --> 00:09:02.300
we want to show sold out,

148
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.310
and this will work in the exact same way.

149
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.335
If I go over to here,

150
00:09:06.335 --> 00:09:11.440
you'll see none of these actually sold out so nothing is going to show up anyway.

151
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.520
But if I go back to the old collection,

152
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.820
I have set up a product that is sold out.

153
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:23.005
I just called it product with no image and no stock and you can see here it's sold out.

154
00:09:23.005 --> 00:09:30.560
If I go and put this back to how it was before and I hit Save on that,

155
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.920
you'll see we get the exact same result.

156
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:41.755
Unless is just a way to make your code more readable.

157
00:09:41.755 --> 00:09:44.620
In this case, I think it makes more sense to use

158
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.490
if but they've decided to use unless here.

159
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.705
Saves them from having to write a comparison operator.

160
00:09:52.705 --> 00:09:54.610
I guess that's why they did it.

161
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:59.875
The final line inside this loop is this link tag.

162
00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:05.875
We're again creating a link with the same tag and filter as above here.

163
00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:11.635
This is going to link to the product URL, the actual product.

164
00:10:11.635 --> 00:10:14.935
We're going to include the image.

165
00:10:14.935 --> 00:10:18.280
The real thing to look at here is line eight,

166
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:23.710
because we're constructing an image tag here with some attributes and some filters.

167
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.610
I'll hit "Save" and we'll quickly look at how that looks.

168
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:32.920
Now you'll see we've got the images included here like before.

169
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:39.655
Let's break it down. Let's first remove this filter here and see what happens.

170
00:10:39.655 --> 00:10:47.500
Now we just loading up the product featured image source in this source tag.

171
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.900
Image is an object as well.

172
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.905
That's why we can chain another dot here to get the actual src of the image.

173
00:10:53.905 --> 00:10:57.040
You can see here we're getting a different attribute of the image here,

174
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.770
the alt tag, but we'll get to that in just a sec.

175
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:07.435
If I save and I go back to the collection page.

176
00:11:07.435 --> 00:11:10.600
Right now you'll see that all the links are broken.

177
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.630
If I inspect one of them,

178
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:16.495
you'll see we have a relative URL,

179
00:11:16.495 --> 00:11:19.404
but it's not going to work in Shopify.

180
00:11:19.404 --> 00:11:24.160
What we need to do pass that image through a filter.

181
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.270
The filter we had is image URL.

182
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.150
Here you can see a parameter of large,

183
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:37.450
but we can remove that parameter and just have the image URL tag with no parameter.

184
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:40.075
If we go back, refresh the page,

185
00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:42.385
you'll see we get images showing up,

186
00:11:42.385 --> 00:11:45.370
but they all show up at a 100 pixels wide.

187
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.095
That is the default behavior.

188
00:11:47.095 --> 00:11:51.850
But we can actually change this to whatever you want.

189
00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.845
Maybe we want it to be 200 by 200.

190
00:11:55.845 --> 00:11:57.945
We can do something like this,

191
00:11:57.945 --> 00:12:01.965
or if we want it to be the same width and height.

192
00:12:01.965 --> 00:12:05.085
We don't actually need to put the value after x.

193
00:12:05.085 --> 00:12:08.415
We can just hit "Save" on that.

194
00:12:08.415 --> 00:12:13.720
Now we should see our image is being twice as big. There you go.

195
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.840
I think that's a quite good middle ground between

196
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:22.195
those really large images and the ones that come out by default, which is a 100.

197
00:12:22.195 --> 00:12:25.450
Now this is really handy to have this as you can

198
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.600
put in a really big image into your Shopify dashboard,

199
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.775
but as long as you write code that limits the size of that image,

200
00:12:33.775 --> 00:12:38.200
then that is how big the image will be loaded in the browser.

201
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.435
What I mean by that is if we actually go and click on open image in new tab.

202
00:12:43.435 --> 00:12:51.670
Whether the original image we uploaded was a 1,000 pixels wide or 200 pixels wide.

203
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:57.475
It's only going get served from Shopify servers as a 200 pixel by 200 pixel image.

204
00:12:57.475 --> 00:12:59.935
That's good for image optimization.

205
00:12:59.935 --> 00:13:02.200
So rule of thumb here,

206
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.775
if you're including an image,

207
00:13:03.775 --> 00:13:06.970
always use parameter here and specify

208
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.270
the max dimensions that you think that image needs to be.

209
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:16.090
Because there's no point serving an image that is way bigger than what you need it for.

210
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:21.850
This final tag is for the alt attribute of your image.

211
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.235
Should be familiar with alt attributes.

212
00:13:24.235 --> 00:13:30.295
They describe the image for robots and people that can actually see the image.

213
00:13:30.295 --> 00:13:36.250
Here you can see alt awesome sneakers If I remove the escape filter here,

214
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.560
you probably weren't noticed a difference.

215
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.685
Go back, refresh the page.

216
00:13:42.685 --> 00:13:44.860
You'll see we still get the same result.

217
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:51.655
But what the escape filter does is if there is any HTML in this attribute,

218
00:13:51.655 --> 00:13:53.245
it makes sure to escape it.

219
00:13:53.245 --> 00:13:57.910
This is something that can catch you out at any point with Shopify theme programming and

220
00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:05.160
Shopify theme development is HTML that is coming from an objects in Shopify,

221
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.995
being injected into your code and breaking everything.

222
00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:10.440
Just a tip if you see anything really weird,

223
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.580
you're whole pages breaking and you didn't write any code for that to happen.

224
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.710
The code might actually be coming from a value that you're bringing through and liquid.

225
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.935
Good practice just to be safe, escape it.

226
00:14:22.935 --> 00:14:26.610
Now I don't think there's going to be HTML in your alt tag typically.

227
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:30.625
But just a safe little option there.

228
00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:34.750
You don't want any HTML coming through in this alt attribute.

229
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.810
Now, it's not style nicely.

230
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.000
We need to still styled with CSS.

231
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.875
But we've got the major points coming through.

232
00:14:41.875 --> 00:14:44.700
We've got title, the price and the image,

233
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:51.075
and both the image and the title link to the actual product for us to go check it out.

234
00:14:51.075 --> 00:14:53.445
Let's go back to the collection page.

235
00:14:53.445 --> 00:14:58.365
Now we just need to introduce back the paginate object.

236
00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:01.950
For that, because I don't know off the top my head how to do it

237
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.700
because it's already written for us most of the time in Shopify.

238
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.995
I'm going to access the docs end.

239
00:15:07.995 --> 00:15:10.210
This is a good opportunity to follow

240
00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.360
along as well because this is what you are going to be doing as well.

241
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.120
If I just type in Shopify liquid,

242
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.510
what I'm looking for is the liquid reference,

243
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.320
say right here. What are we looking for?

244
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.545
We're looking for the paginate tag.

245
00:15:26.545 --> 00:15:28.825
I will go into tags.

246
00:15:28.825 --> 00:15:33.655
I think it'd be closed as a theme tag, and it is.

247
00:15:33.655 --> 00:15:36.880
You can click here, and there you go.

248
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.855
All you got to do is wrap these tags

249
00:15:40.855 --> 00:15:45.790
around a for-loop and you get pagination. Pretty simple.

250
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:50.770
Pagination is a pain in the ass for a lot of other programming,

251
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.605
but Shopify makes it really easy for us.

252
00:15:53.605 --> 00:15:57.910
We are on the collection template so we can just copy this example.

253
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.935
I can go back here.

254
00:15:59.935 --> 00:16:04.135
I think five per page is an all right number for us.

255
00:16:04.135 --> 00:16:12.190
We can code mri end tag as well here and paginate.

256
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.320
I'm going to hit save on that.

257
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.210
Go back into here,

258
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:22.990
refresh the page and you'll see that only five items show up per page.

259
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:27.670
Now, what it doesn't give us is the navigation to actually paginate.

260
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.930
Because we are missing one piece of code from the start of here.

261
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:37.645
To check that we can actually go and click on here and look at older versions.

262
00:16:37.645 --> 00:16:42.169
Let's look at the original before we made any changes.

263
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.395
We can see here,

264
00:16:44.395 --> 00:16:46.300
we've got this conditional.

265
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.630
I'm just going copy this and go back to our current.

266
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.200
At the end of the for-loop,

267
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.910
I'm going to paste that code that I took from the original code.

268
00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:02.470
Now we can access the paginate object,

269
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.155
which is available within the paginate tag.

270
00:17:05.155 --> 00:17:08.995
This is a helper object that Shopify gives us so that we can

271
00:17:08.995 --> 00:17:13.900
actually check how many pages there are in this pagination.

272
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:20.440
You check the attribute code pages and we check to see if there's more than one page.

273
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:26.620
Now we can use the paginate object again with a easy to use filter,

274
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:31.720
which will transform the paginate object into a default pagination.

275
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.645
A lot of magic is going on behind the scenes here.

276
00:17:34.645 --> 00:17:36.940
If you want to customize your pagination,

277
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:42.340
you can access the attributes on this paginate objects and manipulate them how you want.

278
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.320
But for our purposes,

279
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.410
we're just going to use the default pagination.

280
00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:51.055
I refresh the page here after saving,

281
00:17:51.055 --> 00:17:55.750
and now you can see we've got this default pagination.

282
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.835
Usually, what you would do,

283
00:17:57.835 --> 00:18:01.045
because you probably wouldn't be using the default pagination in

284
00:18:01.045 --> 00:18:05.755
a proper theme because you'd want to look nice and according to your style.

285
00:18:05.755 --> 00:18:10.375
You'd usually create a pagination snippet and include it here.

286
00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:13.045
In the next video, we'll be talking about sections and snippets.

287
00:18:13.045 --> 00:18:15.775
Not long to learn about snippets,

288
00:18:15.775 --> 00:18:17.755
but to finish off this lesson,

289
00:18:17.755 --> 00:18:20.770
I need to talk to you about layouts.

290
00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.705
We could have started with a layout,

291
00:18:22.705 --> 00:18:31.030
but I wanted to start with the 18 line file rather than this one which is 43 lines.

292
00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.840
For those of you who need a little recap on what a layout is,

293
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.940
this is what gets served as a wrapper on all your templates.

294
00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:44.230
Unless you specify an alternative layout on a template,

295
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:49.375
this will be the wrapper that goes around every single template in your store.

296
00:18:49.375 --> 00:18:51.925
Assuming we only have one layout here,

297
00:18:51.925 --> 00:18:55.030
and it's using the default name theme.liquid,

298
00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.915
this is going to be the wrapper that wraps around every template,

299
00:18:58.915 --> 00:19:02.665
and the point which it wraps around is right here.

300
00:19:02.665 --> 00:19:08.095
This special tag, content_for_layout is where your template gets loaded.

301
00:19:08.095 --> 00:19:10.690
I want to show you that in practice right now.

302
00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:15.985
We can see that this main tag comes in the layout file,

303
00:19:15.985 --> 00:19:18.295
and then within that, we're loading the template.

304
00:19:18.295 --> 00:19:22.195
Let's go to our collection template again,

305
00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:25.000
and we'll see it starts with a h1.

306
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.440
If I look in here and inspect the code,

307
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.915
I already have the inspect open,

308
00:19:31.915 --> 00:19:35.710
but you'll see we've got the h1 of the collections template,

309
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.675
and then we have main.

310
00:19:37.675 --> 00:19:41.170
Everything above here is going to be the same apart

311
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:45.085
from the dynamic content that gets loaded in on every single page.

312
00:19:45.085 --> 00:19:48.385
If I go to the blog page,

313
00:19:48.385 --> 00:19:52.330
you'll see the head and the start of the body is the same,

314
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.000
and you've always got this main here,

315
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.215
then inside the main,

316
00:19:56.215 --> 00:19:59.335
you have all the code of the template.

317
00:19:59.335 --> 00:20:03.350
Going back to the collections page.

318
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.680
Content_for_layout,

319
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:11.020
that's where the template of the page you're currently looking at is loaded.

320
00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.020
But of course, we've got all this other content around it.

321
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.435
Right here is a navigation.

322
00:20:16.435 --> 00:20:18.490
Right here is a link to a cart.

323
00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.660
If customer accounts enabled and a customer is logged in,

324
00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.600
we will show a link to access their accounts.

325
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.995
If they're not logged in,

326
00:20:26.995 --> 00:20:28.910
but accounts is enabled,

327
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.810
we'll give them a login link.

328
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:35.265
We're going to move that into its own section in the next video.

329
00:20:35.265 --> 00:20:37.080
There's a very good reason for that,

330
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.170
but that makes up the whole body section of your layout.

331
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.805
Then you've got the head section,

332
00:20:42.805 --> 00:20:48.925
which you only really need to worry about if you're going to be including extra assets.

333
00:20:48.925 --> 00:20:52.495
You can see all the standard stuff that you would have in an HTML head.

334
00:20:52.495 --> 00:20:54.685
The title, meta tags,

335
00:20:54.685 --> 00:20:57.085
these objects for SEO.

336
00:20:57.085 --> 00:21:01.225
The page title is whatever the title of the page is,

337
00:21:01.225 --> 00:21:04.060
it's not the same as page.title because it's not

338
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.035
a Shopify page that the ones that you would customize here,

339
00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:10.900
it's whatever page you're on,

340
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.435
the website, that's the page title.

341
00:21:13.435 --> 00:21:16.660
Then page_description is your SEO description,

342
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:22.645
you add your SEO data here and then you have this special tag called content_for_header.

343
00:21:22.645 --> 00:21:24.250
As it says here,

344
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.650
this is simply a header hook for plugins.

345
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.970
This is a point that plugins and I

346
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.950
believe code that you put or preferences that you put here.

347
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.915
If I go into preferences,

348
00:21:37.915 --> 00:21:41.515
basically anything you want added to your head dynamically,

349
00:21:41.515 --> 00:21:44.680
it'll get inserted where that tag is.

350
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.255
I believe some of this,

351
00:21:46.255 --> 00:21:50.244
if you add it in a Pixel or a Google Analytics,

352
00:21:50.244 --> 00:21:53.560
and the place where it would insert it in the head is right here,

353
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.630
but you don't have to edit that at all.

354
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.430
In fact, I think the editor will error,

355
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.455
if you try and change that,

356
00:21:59.455 --> 00:22:02.005
that is what content_for_header is.

357
00:22:02.005 --> 00:22:03.370
Don't need to change it,

358
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.065
just leave it where it is.

359
00:22:05.065 --> 00:22:08.395
Then right here is when we bring in our assets.

360
00:22:08.395 --> 00:22:10.480
We've got some filters here,

361
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.330
and I'll just show you what these do quickly.

362
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:22.929
We've got this application.scss.css and if we just output that on the layout by itself,

363
00:22:22.929 --> 00:22:26.560
number one it'll break any styles we created which we didn't,

364
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:31.300
but you'll see here, it just literally outputs that text to the screen.

365
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.320
If you create an output tag and just literally put a string in there,

366
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.255
you're basically doing nothing.

367
00:22:37.255 --> 00:22:41.410
You could remove this from either side and it'll be the same result.

368
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.310
But what we're doing here is we're taking that and we're filtering it,

369
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:49.710
we're finding the full asset URL of that asset.

370
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.125
Let's just do that first.

371
00:22:52.125 --> 00:22:56.475
Refresh the page and now you can see this becomes

372
00:22:56.475 --> 00:23:02.000
a full URL generated by Shopify server that will link you to the asset.

373
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.710
Then finally, with the last filter on there,

374
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:10.765
it transforms that URL into a fully constructed stylesheet tag.

375
00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:13.750
If I hit save, refresh the page,

376
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:19.270
you'll see that the URL doesn't show up now because it's encapsulated in a HTML tag.

377
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.940
If I look down here,

378
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.195
there's a lot of generated tags in there.

379
00:23:25.195 --> 00:23:28.030
You can see that one now bringing it into

380
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:31.915
our project for a link tag and not just outputting it on the screen.

381
00:23:31.915 --> 00:23:37.810
We can actually just copy that HTML word for word,

382
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.000
put it in here like this.

383
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.330
Then if we remove that,

384
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:50.710
which generates the stylesheet tag and just replace the href with that value,

385
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.975
we should get the same result.

386
00:23:52.975 --> 00:23:58.150
Now we should see it showing up twice, actually.

387
00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:02.395
Of course, because I took the stylesheet tag off this one.

388
00:24:02.395 --> 00:24:05.575
This one is just showing the asset URL

389
00:24:05.575 --> 00:24:10.750
and this one is the fully formed link to the asset.

390
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.450
What I just did that with this line is essentially

391
00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:18.160
the same thing as if I used the stylesheet tag filter there.

392
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.145
Not important for you to understand in terms

393
00:24:21.145 --> 00:24:24.580
of editing this because you probably don't want to touch this,

394
00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.600
but it's important to know how it works you're not confused when say, for instance,

395
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.750
you want to include another stylesheet tag,

396
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.900
you would just have to duplicate this, put it under,

397
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.685
and then maybe your next file is just called styles.css.

398
00:24:39.685 --> 00:24:44.530
That is how you would include a new asset that you included here

399
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:49.375
in your Shopify theme everywhere that this layout is included.

400
00:24:49.375 --> 00:24:51.490
But in terms of transforming that into

401
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:55.810
a fully fledged asset URL and then creating a tag out of it,

402
00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.925
you don't really need to mess with.

403
00:24:57.925 --> 00:25:01.165
The same is happening here with JavaScript,

404
00:25:01.165 --> 00:25:03.580
where taking the filename,

405
00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.670
creating a fully fledged asset URL from Shopify

406
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.180
and then transforming that into a script tag.

407
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.755
I'm going to save that.

408
00:25:11.755 --> 00:25:14.350
This is more of a theme structuring thing.

409
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.240
But just to demonstrate,

410
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.100
I am going to show you how to do an alternate template.

411
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.055
Here we can create,

412
00:25:24.055 --> 00:25:25.870
I'm just going to call it alternate.

413
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.315
You can call it whatever you want.

414
00:25:28.315 --> 00:25:34.690
Let's just remove all of this navigation content and hit save.

415
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:39.010
Now we've got this alternative layout that we can use.

416
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:44.650
How we would actually make that layout apply to a certain template is

417
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:50.560
we can go to the start line of any template and use the layout tag.

418
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.610
Instead of theme.liquid, now it's going to be theme alternate

419
00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:59.770
and if I put that tag at the start of our template,

420
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:04.780
refresh the page, you'll now see there's no navigation.

421
00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:10.270
All right. If I remove it and hit save,

422
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:15.325
now you'll see that we have the same theme as before.

423
00:26:15.325 --> 00:26:17.395
Most of the time,

424
00:26:17.395 --> 00:26:21.025
it's not important to have a second layout,

425
00:26:21.025 --> 00:26:22.615
but it is there as an option.

426
00:26:22.615 --> 00:26:26.920
I'm just going to delete that one because we don't want to have to make changes

427
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:31.510
to multiple theme layouts for this project and for this class,

428
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.880
we only really need one layout file,

429
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.580
but the option is there to create different layouts.

430
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.075
Maybe you want a page with less content on it.

431
00:26:40.075 --> 00:26:43.000
Maybe we don't want the header or footer, for example.

432
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.175
We can remove that from an alternative layout and then use that layout on the template.

433
00:26:48.175 --> 00:26:51.965
Hopefully, that has made it really clear what's going on in

434
00:26:51.965 --> 00:26:57.630
a basic template like here for collection and your layout file.

435
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:01.140
What I want to leave you with before we go into sections and snippets,

436
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.605
is this part of my documentation,

437
00:27:05.605 --> 00:27:07.765
which is template-specific objects.

438
00:27:07.765 --> 00:27:10.765
Talked a bit about it in the previous video.

439
00:27:10.765 --> 00:27:13.720
But I just want to make sure you fully understand this.

440
00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:20.470
We start with the layout file and then the template for the page where currently

441
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.560
looking at gets loaded inside this container

442
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.940
here because we've put this content_for_layout tag here.

443
00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:34.285
Now we have access to the particular objects that goes with that template.

444
00:27:34.285 --> 00:27:39.055
What I want you to understand here is when we're on the collection template,

445
00:27:39.055 --> 00:27:41.605
we don't have access to a product

446
00:27:41.605 --> 00:27:45.130
because we don't have any concept of what product we're looking for.

447
00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:48.550
Unless we loop through a collection and access its products,

448
00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:53.070
then we can affect a particular product from within a loop.

449
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:56.360
Same can be said for if we're in a blog.

450
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.450
When we're in a blog template,

451
00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.055
we're looking at a specific blog.

452
00:28:00.055 --> 00:28:02.125
We can use the blog object,

453
00:28:02.125 --> 00:28:08.800
but we can't actually access a article unless we loop through the articles in that blog.

454
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.635
The same thing with collections and products.

455
00:28:11.635 --> 00:28:15.835
But then when we go into the product or the article page,

456
00:28:15.835 --> 00:28:18.520
we've already seen the product page or product template.

457
00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.725
Let's look at the article template.

458
00:28:20.725 --> 00:28:24.745
We can access the article object specifically

459
00:28:24.745 --> 00:28:29.995
because this is the template that gets loaded when an article is being viewed.

460
00:28:29.995 --> 00:28:32.200
I just wanted to make that super clear.

461
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.775
If it still doesn't make sense,

462
00:28:33.775 --> 00:28:36.250
give me a comment in the discussion box below,

463
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:41.800
but that is template scope and templates-specific objects.

464
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.475
That's why templates are really important.

465
00:28:45.475 --> 00:28:47.035
But at the same time,

466
00:28:47.035 --> 00:28:50.095
you might not want to include a lot of code in your template.

467
00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:54.610
You might want to link directly to a section and there's a very good reason for that,

468
00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:57.620
which we'll go into in the next video.
