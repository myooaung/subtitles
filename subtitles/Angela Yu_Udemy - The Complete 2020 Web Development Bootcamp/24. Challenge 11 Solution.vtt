All right, let's go through the answer to this challenge.
1

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.290
The steps that we need to perform are we need to create a global container inside our app.js to
2

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.260
be able to store each of the posts that come in through this post route
3

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.700
when we compose a new blog post. And then we need to be able to redirect from this post route to our get
4

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.470
route for the home page or the root  route.
5

6
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.130
And there we're going to console log all of the posts that we've saved.
6

7
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.010
So the first step is creating that global variable. You might have created something using a var
7

8
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:46.740
and we said that we should call it posts which is plural to save all of our individual posts. And then
8

9
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.850
we're going to set it to an empty array to begin with.
9

10
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.190
So now inside our post route we're able to tap into that posts array,
10

11
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.560
remember the s.
11

12
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.540
And then we're going to use the push method to add elements into the array And you can easily find this
12

13
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.790
out
13

14
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.940
if you google for how to add new items to an array for example. There's a lot of methods and a lot of keywords
14

15
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.210
but you don't have to remember any of them.
15

16
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.520
Remember that programming is just like an open book exam.
16

17
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.170
Everything is out there on the Internet for you to find and you don't have to resort to memorizing these
17

18
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.490
things at all.
18

19
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.580
You just have to know that they exist and roughly how they work.
19

20
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.570
So now let's use this method push to add our you post item into it.
20

21
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.610
At this stage we should at least have one item inside our new post array.
21

22
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:49.890
Next it's time to use res.redirect in order to send our user back to the home page or the root
22

23
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.680
route.
23

24
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.340
And what this line will do is it will take us right over here and jump into this root route.
24

25
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.910
It's at this stage where we'll console log our posts array so that we see all the posts that are currently
25

26
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.220
stored inside.
26

27
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.620
So now let's give it a spin.
27

28
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:18.060
If we head over to our compose page and we add some mumbo jumbo in here, hit publish, we get redirect back
28

29
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:26.250
to the home route and inside our console we get that new post printed and you can see that denoted by
29

30
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.420
the square brackets,
30

31
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.410
this is inside an array.
31

32
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.120
The final thing that I would like to change is we know that this has to be a global variable,
32

33
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.190
it has to be reached by all of these functions.
33

34
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.750
So this is why it's right up at the top and it's outside of any of these other functions.
34

35
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.580
The only thing I would change about this as we mentioned many times before,
35

36
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.120
instead of using a var, you want to go from a let.
36

37
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.790
So a let is a safer version of a var.
37

38
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.330
So this is the solution to challenge 11.
