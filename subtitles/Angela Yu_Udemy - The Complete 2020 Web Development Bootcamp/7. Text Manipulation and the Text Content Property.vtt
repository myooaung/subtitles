Up till now we've seen that we can change the text inside the selected HTML element using this thing
1

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.280
called innerHTML, but there's actually another property that you can tap into,
2

3
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:20.510
and it's called the textContent. And it might seem at first glance that they do exactly the same thing,
3

4
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.850
they basically just change the text of whichever element that we select,
4

5
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.260
right?
5

6
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.510
But actually it's slightly different because the innerHTML does exactly what it says on the tin,
6

7
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.420
it actually gives you the HTML that's in between the element tags.
7

8
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.860
So for example if I tried to get the current value of the HTML, it's Hello.
8

9
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:53.750
But let's go into our code and if I add a strong tag around the word Hello, then I also get the strong
9

10
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.990
tags. But if I tried the same thing with textContent, then that's kind of exactly what it is,
10

11
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.200
right?
11

12
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.980
It just gives you the text content.
12

13
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:11.450
So what this means is that if you select the h1 element and then use innerHTML, then it will literally
13

14
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:20.360
give you all of the HTML that is inside that element tags, including any other HTML tags.
14

15
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.490
So this means that if you use innerHTML, you can also add HTML code on the fly.
15

16
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.030
So, for example, if we wanted our Hello to not only change its text to Good Bye,
16

17
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.960
but we also wanted that word to be emphasized,
17

18
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.640
so to be italicized effectively, then we can assign an em tag around the word,
18

19
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.650
and that goes into the innerHTML of the h1, and you can see that we changed the text and we also
19

20
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.710
applied that HTML element to the text.
20

21
00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.510
But remember that when you're writing code like this, the HTML also has to go into quotation marks, because
21

22
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.690
the value has to be a string, because otherwise it's going to think it's Javascript code, and this is
22

23
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.550
certainly not Javascript code, right?
23

24
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.550
So remember that when you're changing this, be it innerHTML 
24

25
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.990
or the style value, you always have to specify it as a string.
25

26
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.210
So have a play around with that and see if that makes sense, and apply some HTML using your Javascript.
26

27
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.540
And in the next lesson we're going to talk about the last thing that we can manipulate which is the
27

28
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.970
attributes of each element.
