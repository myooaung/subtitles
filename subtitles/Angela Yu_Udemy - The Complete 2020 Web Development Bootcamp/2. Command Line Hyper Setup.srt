00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,570
Now in the next few lessons we're going to be learning about something that's really really powerful,
1

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,890
and it's the command line. And a lot of people will tell you that you can only truly call yourself a
2

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,920
developer if you know at least how to use the command line.
3

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,710
Now this depends on who you ask.
4

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,580
But at the end of the day it's a really really powerful way of interacting with your computer without
5

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,300
the need for a graphical user interface.
6

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,830
And we're basically just issuing commands to the computer and getting it to do whatever it is that we
7

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,520
want it to do.
8

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,080
So in order to get started though we're going to install the Hyper Terminal.
9

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,740
Now on a Mac
10

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,470
you already have a terminal application.
11

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,730
But the reason why we're installing Hyper is because, one, we're going to stay consistent between Windows
12

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:56,110
and Mac users, but also hyper is super customizable, and you can check out a whole bunch of themes if
13

14
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,120
you wanted to.
14

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,860
And, similar to Atom, it's got a whole bunch of plugins that you can put in which customizes and makes
15

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,330
Hyper more powerful and does more of what you want it to.
16

17
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:13,510
So, first and foremost, if you're on a Mac just head over to hyper.is and click on Download Hyper
17

18
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,930
for macOS.
18

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,420
And once you've downloaded it it's just a matter of double clicking to unzip it.
19

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,480
And now you have downloaded and installed the Hyper application, and all you have to do is just to move
20

21
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,380
that again into your applications folder.
21

22
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,770
Now on Windows it's a little bit more involved but all you need to do is, again, go to hyper.is, and
22

23
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,170
then click Download Hyper for Windows.
23

24
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:43,540
If the web site doesn’t automatically detect which platform you’re using, then click on Other Platforms
24

25
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,240
and select the Windows.exe. And once you've downloaded that, you should have something called 
25

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,590
hyper-setup.exe.
26

27
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:59,400
So just double click on it to run the setup instructions and once it's done it should show you this
27

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,190
Hyper Terminal, and you can see it right here.
28

29
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,850
Now there's a few other things we have to do before you're ready to go.
29

30
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:12,570
We're going to install something called Git, which we're going to learn about a little bit later on, but
30

31
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,760
we're going to install it now because it comes with something called Git Bash, which is a way for us
31

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,460
to be able to use Bash to be able to interact with the command line.
32

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,360
If you head over to git-scm.com, and by the way all of the links that I'm mentioning are available
33

34
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,940
of course, again, on the Course Resources List, including where to download Git as well as what we're going
34

35
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,830
to show right now.
35

36
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,150
So git-scm.com.
36

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,200
You’re going to head over to Downloads, and then you're going to click on Windows to download it for your system,
37

38
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,950
and it should automatically pick the version that you need.
38

39
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:57,270
So once that's downloaded then simply just double click on the exe file and go through the installation
39

40
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:04,140
wizard, making sure that you have Git Bash checked as something that you're going to install.
40

41
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:11,670
So we're going to keep all of the default options and then we're simply going to keep clicking next
41

42
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,810
until you get to a screen which allows you to install and that will automatically install Git Bash onto
42

43
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,290
your system.
43

44
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,530
Now once that's done I recommend restarting your computer.
44

45
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:31,260
And then we're going to configure Hyper to use Git Bash. And again in that list of links there's a link
45

46
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:36,160
that links to the Hyper configurations, which is this page right here.
46

47
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:43,740
And I want you to simply copy all of this, and we're going to go into Hyper, and you're going to click
47

48
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:52,200
on this little button here, and you're going to go into Edit and Preferences, and it's going to open up
48

49
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,980
your configurations.
49

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,660
So here I want you to delete everything that's currently in there and paste what you just copied over
50

51
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:10,520
and now if you just go ahead and click save and close it down, then Hyper will update its configuration.
51

52
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,860
You should now close down Hyper and then reopen it again from the start menu in order for those configurations
52

53
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:23,470
to go through. The very last thing to do is to check and make sure that the installation has been successful.
53

54
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:32,400
So if you open up a Hyper window and you type echo $, and then SHELL in all caps, and
54

55
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,180
hit enter, you should see /bin/bash.
55

56
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,150
If that is the case then congratulations, you're successful, and you can continue on with the module. If
56

57
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,280
you don't then be sure to review the previous steps we've gone through and it’s especially important
57

58
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,040
that you've installed Git Bash and you've updated the configuration file as shown in the video.
