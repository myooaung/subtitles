Are you ready for challenge 11?
1

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:12,540
Now in this challenge I want you to put this newly created post object inside a global variable called
2

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,780
posts, with an 's' at the end.
3

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:22,590
We're going to have an array that is going to store all of these new posts but it's going to be a global
4

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,800
variable.
5

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,000
You need to create a new empty array that is a global variable and then you're going to add this new
6

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,670
post object to that new array.
7

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,160
And finally at the end of this route you're going to redirect to the root route. And inside the
8

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,570
root route we're going to log all of the posts inside the post array that you created.
9

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:56,190
Once you've completed this, what should happen is I should be able to put in a post hit publish
10

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:04,500
and then let's go back to compose again and let's put in another post and hit publish.
11

12
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,420
And firstly you notice that we get directed to the root route or the home page
12

13
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:18,390
once we've finished composing the post. And then if you take a look inside our terminal you can see that
13

14
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,850
my entire array is being logged
14

15
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,540
and the first time it only contained a single object, the 'Day 1 post, and the second time this array
15

16
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,690
contained two Javascript objects both of my posts, 'Day 1' and 'Day 2'.
16

17
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:42,730
This is the end goal of this challenge and it's time to pause the video and tackle this challenge.
17

18
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,380
All right so here's my first hint.
18

19
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:53,360
What we want to do is to be able to save this post object into an array which we can then log inside this home
19

20
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,410
route.
20

21
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,290
Now in order to do that we need a global variable.
21

22
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:04,850
Remember that global variables have to be declared outside of all of the other functions in the page.
22

23
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,940
So that means you probably have to do it somewhere up here
23

24
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,610
outside of all of the other functions and routes.
24

25
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,360
All right so here's hint number 2. In order to create an empty array
25

26
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,480
you will need to write something like this.
26

27
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,260
Let's say that we were creating a global var variable and we call it posts and then we would create an
27

28
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,950
empty array and assign it to this variable by saying =
28

29
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:42,180
[ ] ; and this would be an empty array that has nothing inside until we add something
29

30
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,740
to it.
30

31
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:53,750
All right so now this is my final hint and that is in order to move from the app.post to the apt.get
31

32
00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:01,370
we're going to need to use something called res.redirect. And this is a method that allows you
32

33
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,100
to redirect to another route,
33

34
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,640
so essentially make a get request on any of the other routes. And if you wanted to redirect and inside
34

35
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,830
the parentheses you would put the route that you want to redirect to.
35

36
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,730
Those are all of my hints and see if now you can complete this challenge successfully.
