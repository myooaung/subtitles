00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:08.200
All right guys. So this module is going to be all about Express. Now Express is a Node framework.
1

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.360
So do you remember in previous modules, we learned that we could add jQuery onto our Javascript to add
2

3
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.930
extra features and make it easier working with Javascript?
3

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.740
Well, Express does the same thing for Node.
4

5
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.420
It's a framework, or basically a bunch of code that somebody else wrote, that adds extra features and
5

6
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.150
helps to organize and structure your code, specifically for web applications built with Node.
6

7
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.400
Now in the last module we said that Node.js was made to basically liberate Javascript from the browser
7

8
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.230
and allow programmers to use Javascript to interact with the computer directly,
8

9
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.310
for example on a server. And that means it has a broad scope.
9

10
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:56.300
It's a low level technology that allows you to interact directly with the hardware of the computer.
10

11
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.020
Now that means that you can create desktop applications using Node. For example Atom,
11

12
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.730
what we've been using so far to edit and write our code, is actually built on Electron which is built
12

13
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.570
on Node.
13

14
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.160
So the scope of Node.js is really really broad.
14

15
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.550
Now Express does something really specific. Now an example of this might be that you could own a single
15

16
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.520
Phillips screwdriver and you can screw all the screws you want using it, right? Any type of screw.
16

17
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.640
So that's Node.
17

18
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.460
It lets you interact with the computer any way you like.
18

19
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.150
But, as we know, if you've done a lot of DIY work, screwing in screws manually using a Phillips screwdriver
19

20
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.740
can get pretty tiring,
20

21
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.560
and you're really at risk of repetitive strain injury, especially if you have a lot of Ikea furniture.
21

22
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.300
So that means in certain cases, for specialized uses,
22

23
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.570
for example if you're doing a lot of DIY, then you might need a motorized screwdriver.
23

24
00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.230
And that's basically Express. It was built to make you write less repetitive code when you're building
24

25
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.760
web applications, and it's made specifically for web developers.
25

26
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.520
So sometimes using Express versus using Node straight out of the box, you're saving yourself 5 to
26

27
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.040
10 times the amount of code that you have to write,
27

28
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.150
and therefore a lot of time as well. And we programmers hate repetition,
28

29
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.180
so Express is really really popular.
29

30
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.340
In fact, if you go onto npm.com and you scroll down, you'll see that the most depended upon packages
30

31
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.940
include Express. And if you have a look at the State of Javascript, which is this annual survey for Javascript
31

32
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.630
programmers, you can see that when they surveyed these people on the back end frameworks, even they talk about
32

33
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.820
it.
33

34
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.420
People really depend on Express.
34

35
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.430
And if you have a look at this graph, you can see that ‘I've used it before, and I would use it again’ is
35

36
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.100
massive for Express, whereas it can't really be said for the other sort of frameworks that help you to
36

37
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.200
do the same thing.
37

38
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.060
So it's a really really big deal in the Node web development community, and this is what we're going
38

39
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.960
to be learning in this module.
39

40
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.630
Now let's go ahead and build a real server using Node and Express to see how we can get our server to
40

41
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.700
start running code on the server side and start doing a lot of the heavy lifting,
41

42
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.130
so we learn how to build a proper backend for our web sites.
42

43
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.270
So once you’re ready, head over to the next lesson.
