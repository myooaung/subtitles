00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.080
All right guys.
1

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.180
It's Angela from The App Brewery again.
2

3
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.510
So at this stage I'm presuming that you've probably at some point in your life done a tutorial or a
3

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.470
lesson somewhere else out there on the Internet and inevitably at some point you'll probably get stuck
4

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.460
on a problem.
5

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.890
Now I spend a lot of time thinking about how I can make the course such that you get stuck less often
6

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.170
but with programming it’s almost a core part of the learning process that you do get stuck and you get
7

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.540
yourself unstuck.
8

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.710
So I tend to find that when I get stuck on something I try to see it as a challenge because usually
9

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.800
when I solve it and when I figure it out there is a huge sense of satisfaction and there's usually some
10

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.900
associated growth.
11

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.530
Now having taught over 100000 students online and offline I've seen people struggle in lots of different
12

13
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.120
ways.
13

14
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.740
And I just wanted to summarize the steps that you can go through when you get stuck on any sort of programming
14

15
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.090
problem and the framework that you can use to get yourself unstuck in the quickest way possible.
15

16
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.420
Now the first step is to evaluate what is the expectation versus what is the reality.
16

17
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.120
What did you expect your code to do or what did you expect to happen and what actually happened.
17

18
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.310
So every time you run your code,
18

19
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.860
think to yourself what do I expect to happen and then see what really happened and try to figure out
19

20
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.910
what is causing the difference.
20

21
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.870
Now while you're writing code it's inevitable that you will end up creating errors. And this can happen
21

22
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.790
when you've made a mistake or spelled something wrong or even when you're just trying to install a piece
22

23
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.270
of software. And those errors are usually accompanied by bits of text or the error message. And you can
23

24
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.170
see this in your browser or in your code editor.
24

25
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.450
And most of the time it might seem like these error messages are written by aliens because they don't
25

26
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.820
seem to make any sense.
26

27
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.190
But you can quite easily figure out the human meaning in English for it by just putting it into Google
27

28
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.310
and you'll usually get lots of different answers as to what the cause might be and how you can fix the
28

29
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.060
problem.
29

30
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.190
And one of the web sites, if you don't already know about it, it's going to shortly become your very best
30

31
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.900
friend, and that is stackoverflow.com.
31

32
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.620
So I recommend searching for any errors that you come across into Google and then heading towards the
32

33
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.530
Stack Overflow web sites that come up as a result.
33

34
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.450
And this is exactly what real life developers do every single day.
34

35
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.820
And in fact I've worked in teams where we will all just go to the pub and have a drink and end the day
35

36
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.100
if Stack Overflow is no longer working.
36

37
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.600
So it's all a part of the developer workflow.
37

38
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.970
Now if that still doesn't help, or you’re confused by the results that you're getting back, then it's a good
38

39
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.750
idea to re-watch some of the video up to the point when the code started breaking or it started doing
39

40
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.200
something unexpected, because in the videos there are always step by step instructions and it's really
40

41
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.010
important that you check to make sure that you haven't made a typo here or there or you haven't capitalized
41

42
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.240
something that shouldn't be capitalized and just re-watch the video right before when your code broke
42

43
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.960
in order to try and figure out what might have gone wrong.
43

44
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:19.200
Now the next step is you can check your code against my code. At the end of every tutorial module,
44

45
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.610
there is a completed project that you can download, and you can scroll through the completed code, compare
45

46
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.450
it to your own, and see if there were any typos, any errors, any mistakes, and if it helps you can even
46

47
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.810
copy and paste sections from the completed code into your own module just to see if that line or that
47

48
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.530
paragraph helped to fix the issue.
48

49
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.190
And if that still doesn't solve it then the next step is head towards the Q & A.
49

50
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:55.620
So, underneath every lesson there is a Q & A section, and it's a good idea to check in the lesson when
50

51
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.060
your app has broken to see whether if anybody else had similar issues to you. And, if you can't find anybody
51

52
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.260
with the same issues, then ask in the Q & A. But make sure that you ask your question in the lesson
52

53
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.810
where you're having the issue. That way it makes it much easier for other students to be able to learn
53

54
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.450
from your mistakes and also for me to be able to quickly identify what the problem might be.
54

55
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.630
And if you have a question about anything in the tutorial it's a good idea just to include the timestamp
55

56
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.810
at which it occurs in the video so I can quickly watch it and figure out what you're referring to so
56

57
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.700
that I can better answer your questions.
57

58
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.280
Now, when you are asking questions in the Q & A, the way to get the most helpful responses and solutions
58

59
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.480
is by following a four step approach.
59

60
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.190
So firstly, tell us, to myself and other students,
60

61
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.570
what did you expect to happen, then
61

62
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:57.060
what actually happened, and then include a screenshot of all of your code that corresponds to this situation,
62

63
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.010
and then include a screenshot of the debug console that includes any errors,
63

64
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.620
if there were any errors or if your app has crashed.
64

65
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.290
Now, to take a screenshot of part of the screen in Windows, all you have to do is hold down the Windows
65

66
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:17.320
key, Shift and S, and then you'll get these little crosshairs show up and you'll be able to take a section
66

67
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.410
of your screen as a screenshot, and, once you let go of the mouse, it will save this to your clipboard ready
67

68
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.710
to be pasted into Paint or any other application.
68

69
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.040
If that doesn't work for you be sure to just Google how to take a screenshot of part of the screen and
69

70
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.660
you'll see lots of videos that can help you with this as well.
70

71
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.380
If you're using a Mac computer, on the other hand, this shortcut is gonna save you a lot of time, and it
71

72
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.140
might be worth noting this down in your notebook. When you use Command, Shift and 4, you get this little
72

73
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:53.350
crosshair that shows up and you can start clicking and dragging the area that you want to take a screenshot
73

74
00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:00.760
with and it will save it automatically to your desktop, which then you can upload into the Q & A area
74

75
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.910
for the lecture.
75

76
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:09.220
So that's just a brief step by step process on what to do and how to get help when you get stuck and
76

77
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.610
it's important to remember that everybody gets stuck sometimes.
77

78
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:19.060
I've spent days trying to find a bug in my code and it turns out to be just a comma that was misplaced
78

79
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:26.170
or a semicolon that was accidentally deleted, and one of the greatest joys, for me anyways, is figuring
79

80
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:32.980
out these problems and fixing them. So don't worry if you do get stuck. Everybody will try to help you.
80

81
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.470
And just remember that getting stuck and solving it is all a part of the learning journey.
