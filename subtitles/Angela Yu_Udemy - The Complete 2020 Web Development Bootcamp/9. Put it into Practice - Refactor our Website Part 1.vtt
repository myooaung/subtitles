WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.470
So, the first thing I want to do is, I want to structure our code so that we keep all of our HTML
1

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.600
element selectors together.
2

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.890
So we've got the body up here and we've got a row of red.
3

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.430
This is just something I like to do because it's so much easier to navigate.
4

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.130
And when you're trying to find things it can be such a pain when you've got things dotted all over the
5

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.000
place, especially in your CSS.
6

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.010
So, now that we've got all of these HTML elements up here, you'll realize that some of these are actually
7

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.620
doing very specific things.
8

9
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.900
For example, this section of code, even though it’s targeting all of the h1s, it's actually only really
9

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.460
applying the style specifically for this title here.
10

11
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.490
So these styles should not really be applied to the h1.
11

12
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.540
Instead it should be applied more specifically to a type of heading. The kind of styles that you want to
12

13
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:59.850
place across all of the h1, h2 and h3 are very very broad, things like, you know, font-family maybe, or
13

14
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.090
a particular color
14

15
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.320
if you have a color scheme. You don't want specific things like, you know, a font size or a line height, because
15

16
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.000
that's something that should really occur more specifically to a particular class.
16

17
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.450
So let's go ahead and change this. Instead of targeting the h1,
17

18
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.860
I'm going to add a class to the h1 and I'm going to call it big-heading.
18

19
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.960
So this is the biggest heading that we have basically and I'm going to place that class somewhere down
19

20
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.490
here and I'm going to have a section that's dedicated to headings and this one is the big-heading.
20

21
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.980
So the big-heading is basically going to be all of this code, so I'm going to cut it and then I'm going
21

22
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.840
to paste it in here.
22

23
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.370
So now what should we use the h1, h2, h3 selectors for?
23

24
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.030
Well, you might notice that a lot of these elements already have the font-family Montserrat-Bold inside
24

25
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.540
them.
25

26
00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.740
So it's worth actually targeting all of the heading elements, so h1 through to h6, and giving it the
26

27
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.700
same font-family that you would want for a heading.
27

28
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.690
And we can do that quite easily by simply saying h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6.
28

29
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.990
And what this does is it applies the CSS rules inside these curly brackets to all of these heading
29

30
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.540
types.
30

31
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.470
And it's the equivalent of basically saying h1, font-family is Montserrat-Bold,
31

32
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:38.430
h2, font-family is Montserrat-Bold, h3, and instead all we need to do is just to put it inside here.
32

33
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.480
And that applies that font-family to all of the headings that we have.
33

34
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.100
And this makes a lot of sense because if all of our headings have the default font of Montserrat-Bold and
34

35
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.910
all of our bodies for the rest of the text has the font-family Montserrat, then it's very easy to customize
35

36
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.870
the appearance of individual headings from there on out.
36

37
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.860
So now we can delete all of this and this and this.
37

38
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.390
So less repetition,
38

39
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.390
much better structure, and more modular code.
39

40
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.280
So those are the things that we are aiming for.
40

41
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.520
Now if we go ahead and hit save and refresh our web site, now we're not expecting to see any changes.
41

42
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.320
We're refactoring the code.
42

43
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.910
We're not trying to change the style.
43

44
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.000
In fact, if it does change then we might have broken something,
44

45
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.610
and we have to check regularly to make sure that our refactoring is not breaking our web site.
45

46
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.160
So let's head back and let's look at the next thing we've got here which is the h2.
46

47
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.500
Now let's take a look at where they occur.
47

48
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.280
So we've got some of these which are the testimonials.
48

49
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.910
And then we've got other ones which are the section headings.
49

50
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.970
We've got another one which is the price in our pricing table.
50

51
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:08.580
So, instead of having an h2 where we add all of these styles, I would recommend to actually give each
51

52
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.050
of these h2s a specific class.
52

53
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:20.820
So, in this case, this class might be called price-text and we can add the same class to all three of
53

54
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.010
the price text h2s.
54

55
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:33.600
And then we can go into our styles.css, find the pricing section, and then target the price-text and
55

56
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:42.880
change its font-size to 3rem and line-height to 1.5.
56

57
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.520
And let's go back over here and refresh and just make sure that we haven't broken anything, looks exactly
57

58
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.050
the same,
58

59
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.200
so that's all good, and then we can head back and we look for the next place where we used an h2.
59

60
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.750
So the other place are these testimonial titles.
60

61
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:11.160
So let's go ahead and add a class here, and we'll just call it testimonial-text, and I'm going to add
61

62
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.520
that class to the other testimonial also, which is here.
62

63
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.040
And then we're going to hit save and we're going to go and find the testimonial section and we're going
63

64
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:32.370
to add the class selector testimonial-text, and we're going to say that the font-size is 3rem and the
64

65
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.040
line-height is 1.5. And the last place where we've got an h2 is this section heading.
65

66
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:45.600
So I'm just going to give it the class of section-heading, and this means that if we decide at a later
66

67
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.900
date to give our web site  more sections, sections that require section headings, then we can apply the
67

68
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.130
same style by simply adding this class to whatever new section we need to create.
68

69
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.000
So now let's go in here,
69

70
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.340
and, in the headings section we've got up here, we've got a big-heading and we're now going to add our
70

71
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:14.840
section-heading, which is going to have a font-size of 3rem and a line-height of 1.5 rem.
71

72
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.410
So now we're able to delete this h2.
72

73
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:25.470
And you might be wondering why I'm going to all this trouble of essentially, you know, kind of going back
73

74
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.930
on what I said earlier, right?
74

75
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.780
We said, ‘Don't repeat yourself’,
75

76
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.810
and that's important when you're trying to refactor your code.
76

77
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.850
But, at the same time, say if you're looking at your web site and you realize, wait a minute, there's something
77

78
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.720
a little bit wrong with, you know, this part of the text.
78

79
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:50.520
Well, then it's as easy as going to Inspect and finding the class that we've got here which is testimonial-
79

80
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.370
text,
80

81
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:58.740
then scrolling to the right section, and we know exactly which part of our code affects the style of
81

82
00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.820
that section.
82

83
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:06.790
And it's very unlikely that on your web site that’s the same at the h1 and h2 level.
83

84
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:13.500
So this is what we mean about modularity, so it allows you to drill down on a specific section very very
84

85
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:20.220
easily and figure out what the problems are or change the style of one particular section without affecting
85

86
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.290
the rest of the web site.
86

87
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.540
Now the last heading element that we've got here is an h3.
87

88
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.000
And in our case we're setting the font size to 1.5 rem.
88

89
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:39.720
So let's check the h3s that we've got on our page. And we've got some of these h3s for our card-header.
89

90
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:49.080
And then we've got some h3s for our CTA heading, which is actually overwritten with the cta-heading
90

91
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.850
class over here.
91

92
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.150
And we've got one more h3 which are the feature titles.
92

93
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:06.060
So it might be a good idea to add a class here and we call it feature-title, and we can
93

94
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:11.100
apply this class to all three of these feature titles.
94

95
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:21.010
And now, if we go into our features section, we can target the feature-title and we can update its style to
95

96
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:32.210
have the font-size 1.5rem, and we can now delete this rather specific h3 styling.
96

97
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:40.170
So now all of our HTML elements are pretty much doing very very broad stroke across the web site
97

98
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.830
type of styling, and there's nothing specific in here.
98

99
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:50.730
Whenever you're trying to apply some specific styles you probably want to ask yourself if you want to
99

100
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.190
use a class.
100

101
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:58.340
Now, in our case, I've been a little bit lazy about adding classes as we're going along with our coding,
101

102
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.350
all because I wanted to save up all of this juicy goodness for our refactoring lesson,
102

103
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:10.830
but normally what you would do is, as you go along, as you're writing the code and as you realize opportunities
103

104
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:16.440
for refactoring, you would do it there and then, rather than waiting for some large refactoring session
104

105
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.340
that's probably always going to be procrastinated on and it's never going to happen.
105

106
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:20.600
All right.
106

107
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:26.730
So the other thing that we noticed while we were scrolling through our HTML code was that if we look
107

108
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.250
at the CTA heading here, it's got a class of cta-heading,
108

109
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:37.050
but actually, if you look at it, it's basically the same as our big-heading.
109

110
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:43.590
So in this case this kind of repetition is not really necessary because we can simply give it the rather
110

111
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:53.700
specific class of big-heading. And you'll see that nothing changes here because the same CSS style is
111

112
00:09:53.790 --> 00:10:00.990
specified inside the cta-heading and also inside the big-heading. And this is almost like, you know how
112

113
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:07.230
we're using Bootstrap classes which have defined specific styles for different types of headings or
113

114
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:11.000
buttons and all we need to do is just add the class,
114

115
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.200
well, we're kind of doing this for ourselves.
115

116
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.700
We want our big headings to look a particular way,
116

117
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.670
our section headings to look another way, and we can reuse these classes across our web site.
117

118
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:27.840
Now the next thing that will be a bit of an eyesore that you might have noticed while you're scrolling
118

119
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:34.770
through the web site is that you see text-align center. Let’s just control or command find that, and you
119

120
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:42.450
can see that there's seven instances where we had to declare text-align center, text-align center, all
120

121
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.240
over the place.
121

122
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:49.410
So if it's occurring this commonly, and it's pretty much in every single section that we've had
122

123
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:57.150
to add text-align center, then it makes sense to simply add this web site wide. So we can make the entire
123

124
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.200
body of our web site text-align,
124

125
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.140
and that way we can delete all of these other instances.
125

126
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:15.210
But remember to keep the one inside your media query, because that's a different use case, that's for
126

127
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.870
when our title goes into the mobile mode.
127

128
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.500
We still want to change it to text-align center.
128

129
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:27.280
So let's hit save and refresh and you'll see that not much has happened, which is good,
129

130
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:34.710
apart from the fact that our title section is now text-align centered and no longer text-align left,
130

131
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.080
which looks kind of weird. But that's no problem.
131

132
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:45.440
It's much easier to write text-align left once, rather than write text-align center seven times,
132

133
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:45.990
right?
133

134
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:54.750
So inside our title section we're going to set the text-align to left, and now everything is good as
134

135
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.620
gold.
135

136
00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:07.790
The other thing that we see repeated pretty much across our CSS is this padding 7 percent 15 percent.
136

137
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:16.650
And if I hit find then you see we've actually specified it in four places and we’ve repeated our code sort
137

138
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.900
of needlessly like this.
138

139
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:28.140
So this kind of padding is usually the container's job, but in our case the container-fluid has kind
139

140
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.820
of been adapted specifically for our title section.
140

141
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:40.140
This is the only place in our HTML where we've used container-fluid so far, because we've made the
141

142
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:47.160
style too specific for this section, whereas it's meant to be something that you should really reuse.
142

143
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:55.950
So let's change container-fluid to 7 percent top and bottom and 15 percent left and right, and then let's
143

144
00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:04.350
put some container-fluids around all of the areas where we had this particular padding style specified.
144

145
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.630
So the first one is inside features.
145

146
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:17.500
So let's scroll to the features section and let's add a div that is a container-fluid and move the closing div 
146

147
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.530
down to the bottom.
147

148
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.110
All right. And then let's go on to the next one.
148

149
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.280
Next one is the carousel-item.
149

150
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.970
So let's find the carousel.
150

151
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.080
It should be inside the testimonial section.
151

152
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.540
So here's our carousel-item.
152

153
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:40.060
And instead of applying the style of 7 percent top and bottom 15 percent left and right to the carousel-
153

154
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:49.690
item, all we need to do is just add container-fluid to the list of classes for this div. And we're going
154

155
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:57.980
to do it over here as well so that both carousel-item divs also have this container-fluid.
155

156
00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.350
Make sure that you don't have any typos like I just did just there.
156

157
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:07.290
So let's go to the next place where we've got our padding 7 and 15, so that's the cta and the footer,
157

158
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.160
and I think that's the last of it.
158

159
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:16.480
So let's go to our cta section and add a div that is going to be container-fluid,
159

160
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.360
and the same in our footer.
160

161
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:31.560
And I'm just going to beautify our code so that it's a little bit easier to see.
161

162
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:38.430
So now that we've narrowed down all of our padding 7 and 15 percent so all the places where this occurs
162

163
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.740
then it's a good time to delete it because we no longer need it.
163

164
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.360
It's now covered by the container-fluid.
164

165
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:52.840
And in fact if you do keep it you end up with two sets of paddings which is not what you want.
165

166
00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.570
So now there's just one found and that's for the container-fluid.
166

167
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.030
So that's perfect.
167

168
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:06.100
So now if we hit save and refresh our web site still looks OK.
168

169
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:14.080
Now the only one that doesn't look the same is our title. Because the container-fluid has 7 percent top
169

170
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:22.770
and bottom padding, then it pushes down our nav bar by quite a bit at the top, which is not what we want.
170

171
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.510
So how can we change this?
171

172
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:32.380
Well, let's inspect using our Chrome Developer Tools, and you can see that we've got this container-fluid
172

173
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:40.160
here that has all of that padding at the top, 100 at the top, 100 at the bottom, which is roughly the 7 percent.
173

174
00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:45.770
So all we need to do is to change this to a value that's a lot lower.
174

175
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.090
So let's say, I don't know, say 3 percent, right?
175

176
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.920
And we restore it to the previous look.
176

177
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.910
So how can we implement this in our code?
177

178
00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:02.480
Well, one way of doing it would be, let's say that we decided, oh, you know what, I'm going to abandon this
178

179
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.040
class, container-fluid.
179

180
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:09.530
I'm going to give it a custom class like title-container or something else like that.
180

181
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:15.200
But remember container-fluid is actually a Bootstrap class, which is quite helpful when we're keeping
181

182
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.540
our web site responsive and all of that.
182

183
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:23.440
So we do want to keep it and we don't want to just, you know, give up and give it a custom class.
183

184
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.580
So how else can we do this?
184

185
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:33.550
Well, what if we changed the padding for title? What if we targeted this specific id instead of the container-
185

186
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.480
fluid?
186

187
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.800
Well that doesn't really work.
187

188
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.900
Let me show you why.
188

189
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:44.120
So, at the moment we've got the container-fluid selected, but now I'm going to select the title section
189

190
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:52.760
and, if I change the padding up here to 3 percent, you'll see that it'll actually add more padding on top
190

191
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.050
of the padding that we've got for the container.
191

192
00:16:55.190 --> 00:17:02.090
So now the container-fluid has some padding and the the title section has some padding, so that doesn't
192

193
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.820
work either.
193

194
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:08.410
We're not overriding this by adding a padding to another HTML element.
194

195
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.330
So what can we do?
195

196
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:16.930
Well, we can combine some selectors in order to say that,
196

197
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.420
all right,
197

198
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.210
so the general container-fluid should have this padding,
198

199
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.280
but in the title section,
199

200
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:33.340
so let's make sure that we actually have a title section that's commented out and let's move our container-
200

201
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:38.320
fluid up here because it's no longer just belonging in the title section, right?
201

202
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:47.210
And we'll call this Containers, and I'm going to move the title section to below the navigation bar, say
202

203
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:54.140
around here, so that it's together with the title image and the download buttons.
203

204
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:59.870
All right. So instead of adding the padding to our title section, what we're going to do is that we're
204

205
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:06.320
going to select the container-fluid, but we're going to say that we only want to change the style of
205

206
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:13.850
the container-fluid, and we're going to set it to have a different padding of say 3 percent at the top,
206

207
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:18.050
15 percent left and right and 7 percent at the bottom.
207

208
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:23.780
But this is going to apply this padding to all of the container-fluids, and that will conflict with
208

209
00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.080
our previous container-fluid selector.
209

210
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:34.940
But what we can do is we can say that for the container-fluid class that is contained inside the title
210

211
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.380
section then apply this specific padding.
211

212
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:46.640
And because this rule is more specific than the one that only targets the container-fluid class, then
212

213
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.430
this will override the previous one.
213

214
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.330
So now let's hit save.
214

215
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:57.320
And if you refresh, then you can see that we've gotten back our previous layout for our top container-
215

216
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:57.870
fluid.
216

217
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:03.770
And if you inspect, and you click on the container-fluid in this top section, you can see that the previous
217

218
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:08.520
padding was overridden by the more specific one that we created just now.
218

219
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:14.920
And I'm just going to pause here for a moment because I want to explain to you how you would combine
219

220
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.800
selectors in CSS. So, to learn about that and more,
220

221
00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:19.910
I’ll see you on the next lesson.
