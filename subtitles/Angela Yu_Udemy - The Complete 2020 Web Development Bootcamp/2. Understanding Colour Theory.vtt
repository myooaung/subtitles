00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:08.520
Now one of the first things I want to talk about is Color Theory. And color theory is the art and science
1

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.760
of creating the right palette for your website.
2

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.040
So take a look at this example.
3

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.690
Now let's say you had a logo where you have flowers which are brown, paintball which is pink.
4

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.960
It looks all very weird and very inconsistent.
5

6
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.960
And take a look at the actual logos. Like what are you thinking when you see these color palettes on
6

7
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.560
the words. The color of the flowers looks a bit like dirt I guess but it also looks a bit like something
7

8
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.460
else. And the paint ball being pink
8

9
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.120
I'm not really sure who that target audience is. But take a look at this.
9

10
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.630
If we flip the color palette, it suddenly all looks like it's meant to be like this.
10

11
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.710
It suddenly all looks a lot better right?
11

12
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.940
It looks consistent with the actual message.
12

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.770
So when you're picking colors you have to be aware of the mood of your color palette.
13

14
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.780
So the predominant color that is going to be in your design really tells a story and it conveys a message
14

15
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.530
to the user.
15

16
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:20.490
For example, Red conveys love, energy, intensity. Which is why you see a lot of car adverts which have a
16

17
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.980
red car on a red background.
17

18
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.250
It's because they're trying to tell you,
18

19
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.560
"Hey buy this car and you'll feel energetic
19

20
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:38.220
and the intensity of this car even if you're 89." Now yellow is more about joy, intellect, attention.
20

21
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.290
And the most important thing about yellow though is how attention grabbing it is because it's almost
21

22
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.550
impossible to not look at something that is very yellow.
22

23
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.530
For example this ad. Now a few years back
23

24
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.220
this ad caused an uproar because it has this lady in a yellow bikini
24

25
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.500
and it says, "Are you 
25

26
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560
beach body ready?"
26

27
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.740
And a lot of people got really really upset about it.
27

28
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.090
They took to the Internet,
28

29
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.420
they raved about it.
29

30
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.390
And I remember thinking to myself at the time, "You know, this is not so different from a lot of the other
30

31
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.880
ads that are trying to tell women how to look."
31

32
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.100
And it's not a great message.
32

33
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.580
But why is it causing so much anger and causing so much attention drawn to it?
33

34
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.270
And I think the reason is because it's actually bright yellow.
34

35
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.450
It's impossible to ignore this advert when you come across it.
35

36
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.420
So when you're creating a logo or when you're creating some sort of headline, then yeah yellow is a great
36

37
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.090
choice. But when you're creating something that's designed to be looked at for a long period of time
37

38
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.290
then yellow can be too attention grabbing. It might actually hurt your user's eyes
38

39
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.000
if you tried to read a whole article that's backgrounded in yellow.
39

40
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.670
Now the next color that we're going to talk about is green which is all about freshness, growth, safety.
40

41
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:13.110
And that's why you see a lot of grocery companies like Hello Fresh or Amazon groceries use this color
41

42
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.120
as their predominant color palette. Because it's trying to tell you, "Hey look! This thing is edible.
42

43
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.620
This is what we're selling."
43

44
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.870
And so if you have a company that has anything to do with food, this is usually a safe bet to go with.
44

45
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:37.440
Now Blue is about stability, trust, serenity. And so you see a lot of companies which need to convey that
45

46
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.980
"Hey, we're really trustworthy"
46

47
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.930
use this color. For example,
47

48
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.640
look at all the financial companies, look at companies like PayPal or the cryptocurrency companies like
48

49
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.680
Coinbase. They all choose this color because they want you to know that they're not going to run away
49

50
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.060
with your money.
50

51
00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:01.170
In fact, there was a really interesting psychology study where they compared interviewees wearing different
51

52
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.550
colored shirts.
52

53
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.700
So for example, a group of them would wear a green shirt,
53

54
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.410
another group would wear a blue shirt and they compared how they were perceived by the interviewers.
54

55
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.050
And it showed that just by changing the color of your shirt to a blue one you vastly increase the amount
55

56
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.180
of trust in you
56

57
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.970
that's given by other people.
57

58
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.390
So have a think about that the next time you're going for an interview.
58

59
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:34.950
Now the final color is purple and it's meant to signify royalty, wealth, femininity. And strangely enough
59

60
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.160
I've come across a number of payday loan companies which use this color palette especially ones which
60

61
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.900
are targeted at women.
61

62
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.690
So, the important thing to think about is that you're making a conscious decision when you're choosing
62

63
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.920
a color palette.
63

64
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.040
It's not just whichever color you like or your favorite color. But it's actually 'what message am I trying
64

65
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.930
to convey to the user' and then picking an appropriate color. Now, usually you're not just going to be
65

66
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.180
using a single color for your design. You're probably going to be using two or three.
66

67
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.850
So at some point you have to think about which different colors to combine.
67

68
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.680
And this is probably the most scientific part of color theory.
68

69
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:28.740
Now very often, designers will rely on scientific ways of combining colors. For example taking two colors
69

70
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.560
that are right next to each other on the color wheel.
70

71
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.170
And this way you create what's called an analogous color palette.
71

72
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.600
And these designs look incredibly harmonious and they really work well together.
72

73
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.450
So this color palette can be really good for things like navigation bars and the body of your website
73

74
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.300
or things like a logo and it's background.
74

75
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:59.160
Now, what it's not so good at though is standing out. If you really want your design to pop, you're better
75

76
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.490
off taking two colors from opposite ends of the color wheel creating what's called a complementary color
76

77
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.280
palette or a clashing palette.
77

78
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.270
Now this complementary color palette really creates that pop.
78

79
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.490
And it really brings out each of the colors.
79

80
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.130
So the next time you go to a supermarket, I want you to take a look at the meat aisle and see if they've
80

81
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.910
used this complementary color palette to make things pop.
81

82
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.620
So, one of the things that you often see is they'll take these fake plastic bits of greenery like fake
82

83
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:42.720
grass or fake bushes and they'll put it in between the meat. And because the green and the red are complementary
83

84
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:50.160
colors it makes the red meat pop out a lot more and gives you this idea of freshness
84

85
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:57.750
even if it's a little bit past the best dates. But what you shouldn't do with clashing colors or complementary
85

86
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:04.710
colors is to try to style text and text background with it because it actually looks very very jarring
86

87
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.440
and you can feel your eyes sort of getting a little bit fuzzy
87

88
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.940
looking at this particular combination. So don't do this when it concerns text.
88

89
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:20.670
Instead, keep it to things like logos or icons or things that you really really want to stand out from
89

90
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.990
each other.
90

91
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.350
Now, there's a lot of other ways that you can combine colors like drawing an equilateral triangle to
91

92
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:34.170
create a triadic color palette or drawing a perfect square.
92

93
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:40.200
Now if you want to, you can head over to a website called Adobe color which lets you mess around with
93

94
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:47.430
all of these different color combinations. So select a triadic color palette or a square color palette
94

95
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.990
and then drag it around the color wheel so that you get different combinations of colors.
95

96
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:59.100
And once you come across a palette that fits the mood of your project, then you can pick the hex codes
96

97
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.790
and just put them straight into your website.
97

98
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.950
Now if all of that sounds like it was a little bit too much work ,then I got you covered.
98

99
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.470
You can also use a website called colorhunt.co.
99

100
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:17.550
This is a website where professional designers have curated some of their favorite color palettes
100

101
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.130
and you can nab the hex codes straight off the website.
101

102
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:28.530
So take a look at the hot and popular sections of this website and use it to guide the pilot scheme
102

103
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.810
for your next project.
103

104
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:37.350
Now when you create a website that has a beautiful consistent color scheme like the one for the LIEBE
104

105
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:44.760
yogurt, you can see how much it makes the design stand out and it becomes really colorful and really
105

106
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:51.000
playful and you can convey different messages using your choice of colors and your color scheme.
106

107
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.060
So think about your color choice and your color palette
107

108
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:59.760
the next time you design your website to make sure that it is consistent with what your brand is about
108

109
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.140
and what your product is about and it conveys the message you want to convey.
