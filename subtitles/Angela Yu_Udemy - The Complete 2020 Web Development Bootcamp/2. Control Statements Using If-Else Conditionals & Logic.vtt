00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.360
Now, in the last lesson, we created what is the basic structure of a love calculator using randomisation
1

2
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.580
and Javascript.
2

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.890
Now, wouldn't it be nice if we could give the user a custom message based on what they got as their love
3

4
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.910
score?
4

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.080
Now in order to do this we need a way of checking what score they got and responding differently based
5

6
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.960
on that score.
6

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.610
And to do that we need to use conditionals. The way that conditional statements work is, you can use the
7

8
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.100
keyword if to evaluate a statement.
8

9
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.440
For example, in this case, if the track is clear. And, if that statement is true, then it will carry out
9

10
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.800
a particular sequence of code.
10

11
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.870
But if that statement is false,
11

12
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.510
so the track is not clear,
12

13
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.950
then you can have an ELSE keyword that tells the computer what it should do instead
13

14
00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.850
in that case. And this, in programming, is known as control flow. We're essentially controlling the flow
14

15
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.420
of our code depending on the current conditions.
15

16
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.940
By the way I had a lot of fun building that toy train set in Keynote. In case anybody else is living
16

17
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.150
in a cramped London apartment and you don't have the space for a full toy set, and you're probably too
17

18
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.660
old to play with them anyways,
18

19
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.610
Keynote is your best bet. Now,
19

20
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.700
this is how we might express our little track scenario in code.
20

21
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.670
So we have the keyword if,
21

22
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.440
and then we have some parentheses.
22

23
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.910
And inside the parentheses are some conditions.
23

24
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:40.220
So if the track is equal to clear then we take the flow of the code into the curly braces straight after
24

25
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:49.110
and then we run the function goStraight. However, if that condition is not true, i.e. track does not
25

26
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.130
equal clear, then the code flows to the else statement,
26

27
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.120
and we run the function turnRight instead.
27

28
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.920
While this is an easy way of seeing how our code works, it doesn't look very good when we have lots and
28

29
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.160
lots of code inside the if and else statement,
29

30
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.940
so more commonly you'll see this code structured like this by Javascript programmers.
30

31
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.130
So we say if, we test the condition, and that's followed straightaway by the block of code that will
31

32
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.160
get carried out if that condition is true, and then we open up the else statement to specify what should
32

33
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.710
happen if that condition is not true. And essentially, through the testing of these conditions, we get
33

34
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.010
to control the flow of code,
34

35
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.560
and that's why they're called conditionals. So let's use what we learned to edit our code in the love calculator.
35

36
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.220
So we have a love score here and we know that we get a number between 1 to 100.
36

37
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.710
So that will be the condition that we will test.
37

38
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.310
So we will say if, which is the keyword here, and then we'll open up some parentheses to add our testing
38

39
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.310
condition.
39

40
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.850
So let's say that our condition was that loveScore is equal to 100.
40

41
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.090
And in order to test for equality we're using three equal signs.
41

42
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.340
And if that is true then this block of code will be executed.
42

43
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.720
But if it's not true, i.e. else, then this block of code will be executed instead.
43

44
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.380
So let's say that, if loveScore was equal to 100.
44

45
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.730
Well that's pretty crazy, right?
45

46
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.760
Then we should say something like, alert "Your love score is " this amount.
46

47
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.990
And then we should give them an interpretation.
47

48
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.190
Like, for example, "You love each other like Kanye loves Kanye.".
48

49
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.420
But otherwise we just give them the plain old normal message where we tell them their love score.
49

50
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.780
Now some might have realized that I would have to go through this many many times until I happened to
50

51
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.430
get a love score that is 100, which is quite unlikely.
51

52
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.680
I mean it's 1 percent likely, right?
52

53
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:07.470
So what if we simply wanted to test for a range, say for example if the love score was between 70 and
53

54
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.270
100, or if the love score was between 0 and 30?
54

55
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.960
Well, in order to do that, then we would have to use something like greater than.
55

56
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.980
So if love score was greater than 70 then we should get this alert,
56

57
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.700
otherwise we get this simple one instead.
57

58
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.680
So let's try this out and we get 58 on the first go.
58

59
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.320
There we go.
59

60
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.160
So we finally got above 70.
60

61
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.780
We've got 76 percent.
61

62
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.730
And we get told that we love each other like Kanye loves Kanye.
62

63
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.300
I used to love Kanye.
63

64
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.750
I thought I was Kanye. What if Kanye made a song about Kanye?
64

65
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.710
Man that would be so Kanye.
