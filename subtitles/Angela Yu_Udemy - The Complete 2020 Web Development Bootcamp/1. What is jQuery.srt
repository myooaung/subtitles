00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,230
All right guys.
1

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,530
Now in this module I want to introduce you to the most popular Javascript library and it's of course
2

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,870
jQuery.
3

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,090
Now there's thousands of Javascript libraries out there, and in later modules we're going to be exploring
4

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,380
some of these libraries,
5

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:23,310
but none of these libraries have been used or downloaded as often as jQuery.
6

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,900
So why is that?
7

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,830
Well let's take a look at some code that we've written before.
8

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:33,690
So if we break this code down, essentially what it's doing is it's looking inside the entire document
9

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,450
and it's querying for all the elements that have the selector of button,
10

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,440
so all of the HTML button elements. And then we're going to add an event listener that is going to detect
11

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:52,470
for clicks on the button. And when it does get detected then we're going to run the callback function
12

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,980
to again look through the document and query for the selector of h1, and then we're going to change
13

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:06,720
the style, namely the color of that h1 to the color red, and we're using a for loop to traverse through
14

15
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:14,820
all of the buttons on our web page in order to add this event listener and this behavior to all of those
15

16
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,330
buttons.
16

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,810
So we wrote this code in our drumkit.
17

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,460
And this is pure Javascript and it's actually a little bit crazy, if you really think about it, in order
18

19
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,580
to do something relatively simple,
19

20
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,380
why does it require so many lines of code,
20

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,270
and who's going to take care of all our joint pain from all this typing?
21

22
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,770
Now you know how sometimes you have these thoughts and you moan and complain about it a little bit and
22

23
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,430
then you kind of get over yourself, right?
23

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,030
But not this guy.
24

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:49,190
This is John Resig, and he was really unhappy with the way that Javascript worked in web development.
25

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,590
He was really frustrated by how unnecessarily complex and lengthy the code had to be.
26

27
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,830
So whereas most of us probably had that thought and we promptly forgot about it,
27

28
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:06,840
not this guy. John decided that he was going to write a library that would do exactly the same as all
28

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,700
of this Javascript code,
29

30
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,480
but it was as short and as sweet as this.
30

31
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,580
And so jQuery was born.
31

32
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,260
It's a library,
32

33
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:23,130
so a bunch of code that somebody else wrote that you can incorporate into your own projects and use to
33

34
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,770
improve your own projects or to make your life simply a lot easier.
34

35
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,100
Now we've come across libraries before.
35

36
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:36,660
Previously we created web sites and we incorporated the Bootstrap library in order to be able to incorporate
36

37
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:44,760
code that somebody else wrote in the Bootstrap library to make our lives much easier and make it much
37

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,840
quicker to improve the user interface of our Web site.
38

39
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,510
Now what jQuery allows you to do is take a line of code, say this, where we're looking through the
39

40
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,490
DOM of our web site, we're selecting the document and we're querying for the selector h1.
40

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,280
So we're looking for the h1 element in our web page.
41

42
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:09,420
Now if we were to use the jQuery library, then we can get rid of all of that and simply say 
42

43
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,430
jQuery("h1").
43

44
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:18,080
And if you want to be even shorter, the shorthand way to write jQuery is simply a dollar sign.
44

45
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:28,230
So $("h1") does exactly the same as document.querySelector
45

46
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,910
("h1").
46

47
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,030
And you can see that it's a lot lot shorter and that will make our Javascript code a lot easier to read,
47

48
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,540
a lot easier to debug and a lot faster to write,
48

49
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,530
so we don't have to end up breaking our fingers by typing so much Javascript code.
