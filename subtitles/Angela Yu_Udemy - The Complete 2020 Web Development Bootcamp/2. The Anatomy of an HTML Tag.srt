1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,170
All right. So let's talk about the anatomy of an HTML tag and break it down to its component parts
1

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,150
so that we can actually understand how they're structured and how we can use them.
2

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,490
So we've written HTML elements like so.
3

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:24,210
So here we have the words Hello World and they're enclosed by an opening tag and a closing tag and in
4

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,870
between those tags is the content that we want to apply that structure to.
5

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,790
So if you think back to the days of marking down a manuscript it's exactly the same as putting down
6

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,230
a squiggly line underneath certain words or phrases and asking the publisher to make it bolded to effect
7

8
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,870
the structure of certain parts of the text.
8

9
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,770
Now in this case the publisher just happens to be our browser.
9

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:57,720
So these tags make requests to the browser asking it to structure and display our plain text in the
10

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,540
way that the web designer wanted it to be shown.
11

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,370
Now the other type of tag that we just saw are tags that don't have a closing tag.
12

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,300
They're expressed simply like so and these are called self closing tags.
13

14
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,170
And we've seen that with the break tag and there's a few more others that work like this also.
14

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,060
Now how do we find out if something requires a closing tag or is self closing?
15

16
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,810
Well this is where we head to the documentation again.
16

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,960
So if we have a look at the documentation for the heading elements you can see that there's this part
17

18
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:42,870
in the table that says ‘Tag omission’ and it says that both the starting and ending tags are mandatory
18

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,130
so that you can specify which portion of your text you want to apply this structure to.
19

20
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:56,720
Now if we have a look at the br or the line break element you can see that under ‘Tag omission’
20

21
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,340
it says that it must have a start tag and must not have an end tag.
21

22
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,820
So this is how we find out how we write our tags.
22

23
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:13,710
Now while we’re here I want to introduce you to another element called the horizontal rule or the hr tag
23

24
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,220
and this will allow us to create these horizontal lines above and below our portion of text.
24

25
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,640
So as you can see in the documentation under ‘Tag omission’ it also says that it must not have an end
25

26
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,300
tag.
26

27
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,310
So this is also a self closing tag.
27

28
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,510
So let's head back over to our pen so that we can add these two horizontal rules above and below our
28

29
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,340
text.
29

30
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,210
So the first one is going to go here
30

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,740
and the last one is going to go here so you can see that our web page now has two horizontal lines above
31

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,440
and below our main portion of text.
32

33
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:59,130
Now if we have a closer look at this web site you can see that their horizontal rule is a little bit
33

34
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,710
thicker than ours.
34

35
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,450
So how can we make ours look more like theirs?
35

36
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,540
Now this is the part where I show you a neat trick. On any web page that you open in Chrome,
36

37
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:18,240
you can simply right click on the element that you're interested in and click Inspect in order to look
37

38
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:25,200
at the HTML and CSS code that's being rendered in the background by the browser. So you can see here
38

39
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:32,450
they've got an hr element, horizontal rule, but they've got also all of this going on afterwards.
39

40
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,590
So what exactly is that?
40

41
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:44,790
Now we know that the first part of the tag is the HTML element and it's br or hr or whatever it
41

42
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,550
is that you want to use.
42

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:55,710
Now the second part inside the angle bracket or inside our tag is new and this is called an HTML attribute
43

44
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:05,040
and it basically gives more information to the browser to specify modifications to that HTML element.
44

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,540
So in this case we're saying that we want a horizontal rule but we want it in size three.
45

46
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:18,040
Now what does size three mean and how do we know that we have these HTML attributes available to us?
46

47
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,440
You've guessed it. We’re going back to the documentation.
47

48
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,690
Now I know I'm making a big deal about going to the documentation but it really really is an important
48

49
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:34,440
skill, understanding and being able to look up the documentation, being familiar with the structure of
49

50
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,430
it and where to look in order to find out how to implement or do certain things.
50

51
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,890
So if we have a look at our documentation for hr you can see that there's this section called
51

52
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,840
attributes and that's what we spoke about just now.
52

53
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:58,750
The attribute comes after the main HTML element and is separated from the element by a single space.
53

54
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,670
In this case the horizontal rule element has actually quite a few attributes including align so you
54

55
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:12,150
can specify whether you want your horizontal line to align to the left or align to the right or
55

56
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,730
be centered. You can specify the color of the horizontal rule.
56

57
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,420
You can set whether you want the horizontal rule to have shading or not.
57

58
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:29,160
And you can also set the height in pixels of that horizontal rule which is what we saw earlier on over
58

59
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,580
here.
59

60
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:37,080
So in this case the reason why their horizontal rule looks different to ours is because ours is by
60

61
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:46,080
default only one pixel high or one pixel in size whereas theirs if you inspect in the HTML is three pixels
61

62
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,220
in height and they've also specified no shade i.e. no shading to the horizontal rule.
62

63
00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:00,510
So if we want to make our website a seamless copy of what we see here then we also have to specify those
63

64
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,710
attributes.
64

65
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,940
So if you remember the horizontal rule is a self closing tag.
65

66
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:11,940
And so inside the tag we're going to make a space and then we're going to specify the name of the attribute
66

67
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,600
which we know from the documentation to be called the size attribute.
67

68
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,680
And we're gonna set it to equal three pixels and then we're going to specify that it is no shade i.e.
68

69
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,230
no shading and we know all of this from the documentation.
69

70
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,390
So now once our code updates you can see that this brand new horizontal rule looks completely different
70

71
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,890
from what it was before.
71

72
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:42,120
And we can copy this over to the top as well so that our horizontal rules look exactly the same as what
72

73
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,680
we've got over here.
73

74
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,210
So now we've seen HTML elements that require an opening tag as well as a closing tag.
74

75
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,520
We've also seen HTML elements that have a self closing tag.
75

76
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:01,440
And finally we've seen that HTML elements can also have an attribute where you can specify modifications
76

77
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,810
to the default element.
77

78
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:11,190
Now all we need is just to add one final tag called center to our HTML file and we would have now
78

79
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,730
faithfully copied what this web site looks like.
79

80
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:22,050
So you can have a look through the HTML by, remember, right clicking and inspecting in Chrome and you
80

81
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,640
can look through to see how they've structured the rest of the document as well.
81

82
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,510
Now this is a good point to mention
82

83
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,930
our first challenge.
83

84
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,640
So we've got this code pen now where we've been messing around with the HTML.
84

85
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,740
Now you can either save this anonymously or you can create a free account in Code Pen in order to be
85

86
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:48,230
able to access this later on. But I want you to create a brand new pen and this pen is going to be our
86

87
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:54,500
code playbook and you're going to use this document as an interactive notebook if you will.
87

88
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,470
And I want you to document here all the new things that you've learned as we progressed through the
88

89
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,750
course.
89

90
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,920
So for example in this and the last lesson we learn about the h1 tag.
90

91
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,910
So in our code playbook the first thing that's gonna go in is your h1 tag and you can say that this
91

92
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:22,090
is a level one heading created using the h1 tag.
92

93
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,490
Go ahead and close it off and you can look through the documentation to perhaps copy some of these code
93

94
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:35,300
snippets over but make sure that whenever you're copying pasting code that you understand what the code
94

95
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,200
does.
95

96
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,570
There's nothing worse than copy and pasting code that breaks your website because you didn't understand
96

97
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,370
what you've put in there.
97

98
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,680
So we can go ahead and then modify each of these so that when we're creating our own websites and we
98

99
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,920
want to come back to our playbook and have it as a point of reference then we'll be able to see easily
99

100
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,750
at a glance all of the elements that we've used and that we've learnt about before.
100

101
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:07,970
So my challenge to you is to create your very own code playbook and to start keeping notes on all the
101

102
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,180
things that you're learning in this course.
102

103
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:17,070
Now sometimes with certain elements for example the line break you won't be able to put any text inside
103

104
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,600
the line break in the same way that we've done so for the h1 tag.
104

105
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,310
This is a point where you can use a comment instead in your HTML file.
105

106
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:34,970
Comments are portions of text which are marked out to be ignored by the browser and they're usually
106

107
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:41,550
places where you write notes yourself or notes to fellow programmers who might be looking at your code.
107

108
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:51,140
So in HTML we create a comment by using the angle bracket, an exclamation mark, two dashes, and then to close
108

109
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:58,190
off the comment we use another two dashes and a closing angle bracket and everything in between here
109

110
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:05,630
is a comment. You can see that it usually gets highlighted in a different color and none of it gets interpreted
110

111
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,380
into the web page.
111

112
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:15,200
So this is where you can put sections for your notes for example self closing tags, you can make it into
112

113
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,840
several paragraphs just by putting the closing tag at the bottom and you can write notes on the elements
113

114
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,370
as we come across them and keep this for your own reference.
114

115
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,250
By the time when you're ready to create your own Web sites it will be a goldmine of a resource to jog
115

116
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,010
your memory on all of the lessons that you've learned.
116

117
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:40,340
So in the next lesson we're going to be building our very first web site and it's going to be really
117

118
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,140
really awesome because we're going to be using a real text editor and we're going to be putting that
118

119
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,480
web site live onto the Internet.
119

120
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,480
So there's all of that and more yet to come.
120

121
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,580
So I will see you on the next lesson.
