00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.640
So in the last lesson we've started this brand new project where we're going to recreate a professional
1

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.940
web designer’s personal site, and we're going to make it look as beautiful if not more beautiful than
2

3
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.380
what we see here.
3

4
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.960
So we started off strong by adding a favicon to our web site, but our web site is right now just a blue screen
4

5
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.640
which is not that professional and not that pretty.
5

6
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.090
So let's go ahead and change it.
6

7
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.380
So head over to Atom and the first thing we're going to do is we're going to get rid of that awful background
7

8
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.570
color and I'm actually going to just delete this entire body section here.
8

9
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.120
I'm going to begin by having no styles whatsoever and I'm going to first specify the structure of our
9

10
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.880
web site.
10

11
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.520
Let's start off by recreating the content of this top part.
11

12
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.210
So there is what seems to be an h1 and something that's just a paragraph just below it and then
12

13
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.740
there's a few images and then we go onto the next part.
13

14
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.380
So let's do that for ours as well.
14

15
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:14.420
So let's go into the body and we're going to create an h1that's going to say ‘I'm Angela’, and after that
15

16
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.860
we're going to create a paragraph that's just going to say ‘a programmer’, and let's hit save and let's
16

17
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.000
check it out.
17

18
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.640
So there we go.
18

19
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.560
Looks pretty boring, right?
19

20
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.580
And it looks nothing like this.
20

21
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:38.180
So the difference here is that you see these two parts are kind of grouped together in what might be
21

22
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.300
a box.
22

23
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.860
And if you look at ours, and if I turn on Pesticide, which is a really really useful tool when you're
23

24
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.210
debugging your CSS.
24

25
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.670
Now you don't need to download it because I'm going to show you what I'm doing but if you want to have
25

26
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.700
it as a tool then you just head over to pesticide.io and you can download and install it on Chrome
26

27
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.900
for free, so you can see that what it does is that it highlights all of your HTML elements and essentially
27

28
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.110
all of the boxes that are on screen.
28

29
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.340
So as we mentioned before essentially all that we're doing when we're using CSS is we're specifying
29

30
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:24.110
the style for how each of these HTML elements should be displayed and each element is basically just
30

31
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.050
a box, so you can see that we've got a box up here which is the h1 and a box down here which is the
31

32
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.110
paragraph,
32

33
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.460
and that the box that's all around them is actually the body.
33

34
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.640
And using Pesticide you can confirm this by holding down the control button and hovering over each section
34

35
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.840
that you're interested in.
35

36
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.750
So if I hover over here you can see that this is showing me that it's a paragraph element and up here
36

37
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.850
is an h1,
37

38
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.340
and in between and all around is the body.
38

39
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.930
And that's what the blue line is.
39

40
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.730
So this can be quite useful.
40

41
00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.950
Now what you might realize now is that we might want to have a box that's around this heading and the
41

42
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:12.710
paragraph tag that we can expand its height and also push down our text to the center of it. So we can do
42

43
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.190
this in a number of ways.
43

44
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.340
But the way that I'm going to talk about here is an HTML element called the div..
44

45
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:29.540
So let's go back into our index.html, and I'm going to create a new element called a div and we're
45

46
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.830
just going to ignore the class for now.
46

47
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:40.130
This div is a special HTML element that allows us to divide our content up on our web site so that we
47

48
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.120
can structure each div separately.
48

49
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.260
Now by itself it doesn't do anything.
49

50
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.590
So if I save this div here and I head back over to Chrome and I turn off Pesticide and refresh,
50

51
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.350
you can see that nothing, absolutely nothing, has changed.
51

52
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.940
And that's one of the reasons why we're talking about an HTML element inside our CSS module. And 
52

53
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:11.270
it's because divs amongst other things don't do anything unless you use CSS with it.
53

54
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.590
So if we turn on Pesticide again you can see that this top part of the body has now got a little bit
54

55
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.840
thicker of a line.
55

56
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:28.460
And if you right click on it and try to inspect it then we can select that div over here inside the
56

57
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.690
Elements tab.
57

58
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.970
And if you scroll this graphic up you can see that it's showing you that it has a width of 1424 pixels
58

59
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.530
and a height of zero pixels which is why we can't see anything.
59

60
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.010
It's something that's 0 pixels high even though it has a width so it doesn't appear.
60

61
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.530
Now what you see up here where it says the outline.
61

62
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.580
Now this comes from Pesticide and that's trying to show you where that div exists even though it has
62

63
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.010
no dimensions.
63

64
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.720
Now if we turn it off then that goes away.
64

65
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.060
And this is what our code actually looks like.
65

66
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.920
So in order for that div to have a function or in order to do anything we have to use CSS. So let's
66

67
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:21.050
select that div inside Chrome Developer Tools, and let's specify some CSS for it inside our Developer
67

68
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.830
Tools.
68

69
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.050
So remember anything that we specify here doesn't get saved and it's only purpose is for us to experiment
69

70
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.790
and see it live immediately.
70

71
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.870
So let's give it a background color of blue,
71

72
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.060
my favourite color.
72

73
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.650
And you can see nothing has changed.
73

74
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:46.940
But if I give it a height of say 100 pixels then immediately you can see it now appears.
74

75
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.980
And here is our div.
75

76
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.690
This is where it is.
76

77
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.330
And if you hover over it that's what's going to be highlighted.
77

78
00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.590
And if I turn on Pesticide again you can see now if I hold on control and hover over you can see that
78

79
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.260
if I turn on control and hover over this section it's showing you this is the div, this is the h1 and
79

80
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:12.590
this is the p. So the div is only there for you to structure and divide up your content.
80

81
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:20.450
So if we wanted our div to perform a similar function to what we've got up here which is the top part
81

82
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:27.890
of the content, where he's grouped together a title, a subtitle and an image, then we can do that using
82

83
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.260
a div.
83

84
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.460
Now remember what I said before about how the changes that you implement in the Chrome Developer Tools
84

85
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.730
don't persist in your code.
85

86
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.030
So if you check back in Atom you won't see any extra code being added.
86

87
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.100
And if you refresh this site then all of those things that you entered inside here will disappear.
87

88
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.140
So that's just for testing basically.
88

89
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.550
So let's head back to Atom and let's do something with this div.
89

90
00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:02.990
So essentially a div stands for a content division element and it basically allows you to split up or
90

91
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:09.430
divide your content into separate containers or boxes so that you can affect the layout of each box
91

92
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.700
separately, so that you can say that maybe these two things should be grouped together, and I'm going
92

93
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:24.280
to structure it and style it separately from other content in my web site. So divs, as we saw before,
93

94
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:32.800
can have a height if you specified it using the styles but you'll also have a height if it has content.
94

95
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:41.230
So if we go ahead and move our heading and our paragraph inside our div here and hit save,
95

96
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:49.050
then you'll see that if we bring up the Chrome Developer Tools again that this div now has a height
96

97
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:56.730
has a height of seventy six point something pixels and that's just enough to fit all the content that's
97

98
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.050
inside, which is the h1 and the paragraph.
98

99
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.280
Now let's give it a permanent background color so that we can see it more easily.
99

100
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.980
And to do that we have to go into our stylesheet.
100

101
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:15.300
But before we do that let's go to Color Hunt and find a good color that we might want to use.
101

102
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.600
So I'm actually going to stick to the same color palette I had before.
102

103
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.300
And so maybe something like this.
103

104
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:28.470
And if we head back into Atom and go into our stylesheet, then we can select our div.
104

105
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.380
And we're going to change its background color to that particular hex code.
105

106
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:43.410
Now if we hit save and we go back to our web site and we hit refresh then you'll see that our div now has
106

107
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.420
a background color and we can see that box of the div more clearly.
107

108
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:56.750
Now the strange thing is, why does that div not go all the way to the end on the left and on the top?
108

109
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.810
It sort of stops just about here.
109

110
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.950
Why is that?
110

111
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:07.700
Well, remember how we said that the browser inserts their own default CSS, the style things?
111

112
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:13.880
For example how the horizontal rules should look like or how the h1s should look like.
112

113
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:21.450
Well, if you take a look at the body element then you'll see that there's this user agent stylesheet
113

114
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:27.180
which we know to be the default styles that are applied by the browser, and you can see that it has a
114

115
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.730
margin of 8 pixels from all the edges.
115

116
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:39.180
So if we change this, and we can do that just down here by double clicking on it and then let's enter
116

117
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.980
zero.
117

118
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:46.200
Now if I hit enter you'll see that that left margin now disappears.
118

119
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.700
Now you might think that we can do the same thing with the top margin.
119

120
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:55.650
So if I delete that and hit enter then you would think that maybe our div would go all the way up to the
120

121
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.510
top, but it doesn't.
121

122
00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.860
Now why is that?
122

123
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.650
Well, because there's also default rules for our h1.
123

124
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:11.850
And as you can see, when I hover over the h1, it already shows you the entire space that it's taking
124

125
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.880
up and you can see that, inside the user agent stylesheet,
125

126
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.260
it’s got a whole bunch of default styles.
126

127
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:27.770
For example, it says that it should have a margin-before, of this amount, and a margin-after, of this amount.
127

128
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:35.400
So margin-before is at the top, margin-after is at the bottom, margin-start is on the left, margin-end
128

129
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.080
is on the right.
129

130
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:43.200
So this margin is what is responsible for that gap that we still have.
130

131
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:51.060
So if I go ahead and change this to zero then you can see now our div is now sticking right to the top
131

132
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.370
of the page.
132

133
00:10:52.440 --> 00:11:00.670
Now as you remember these changes, whether I edit it here or if I edit it inside the style section here,
133

134
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:09.860
so I can say margin-right is zero pixels as well,
134

135
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.740
then I get rid of that right little space, but remember none of this is permanent.
135

136
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:23.740
So the challenge for you is to go and implement these styles in order to override the default browser
136

137
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:32.030
styles and make our div go all the way to all three edges: the left, the top, and the right.
137

138
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.990
So, pause the video and give that a go.
138

139
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:44.950
All right. So all we need to do is just to transplant these changes we made here over to our stylesheet.
139

140
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:51.350
So you'll notice that when I select for example the heading and I double click on the margin and I hit
140

141
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:59.210
0 then you'll see that it inserts this line of code here where it says the margin top should be zero
141

142
00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.870
pixels.
142

143
00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.610
So I'm just going to do that again for the bottom here.
143

144
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:03.810
I’m going to hit 0.
144

145
00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.990
And I want you to watch over here what shows up.
145

146
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:14.460
It's written some more code telling us that the margin-bottom should be 0 pixels as well.
146

147
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:20.330
So we now know what is the CSS that we have to write for our stylesheet in order for it to have the
147

148
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.010
same appearance.
148

149
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:27.230
So let's head over to our stylesheet and let's go ahead and select
149

150
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.570
firstly the body element.
150

151
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:34.180
And we're going to override that 8 pixel margin that it has.
151

152
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.790
And we're just going to say margin is 0.
152

153
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.800
And this means that all four sides is going to be set to 0 pixels for its margin property.
153

154
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:51.230
The other one that we wanted change was the h1, and this one we don't really care so much about the
154

155
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:59.660
other three sides. All we care is about the margin-top, and we want to set this to 0 pixels. So when it's
155

156
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.050
0 you don't actually have to specify the unit,
156

157
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.060
so pixels or whatever else it may be.
157

158
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:13.520
So now go ahead and hit save and head back to our web site, and let's close this down and refresh, and
158

159
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.170
you can see that our div now goes to all three edges.
159

160
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.300
Now what is this diagram all about?
160

161
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.840
It's got this margin border padding and all of these things.
161

162
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:31.030
Well that's what we're going to dig into in the next lesson where we talk about the CSS box model.
162

163
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.080
So I'll see you there.
