1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,590
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:07,110
So in the last lesson we looked at how to use HTML lists that were ordered as well as unordered.
2

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,120
In this lesson
3

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,040
I want to talk about the image element and how we can incorporate images into our web site.
4

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,580
So the image tag is again a self closing tag so it doesn't need to be closed.
5

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,580
But for the image element just providing an image tag isn't enough.
6

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,350
You also need to specify the source and that's the source of the image that will be displayed.
7

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:42,120
So that can either be a URL so it can fetch it from the internet or it can be a local image that's included
8

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,900
in the same directory as your web site.
9

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,770
So we're going to look at both types.
10

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:56,240
But the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to look for an image of myself online and let's have
11

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,290
a look see if there's any images that are actually me.
12

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,960
Oh there we go.
13

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,600
So we already found one.
14

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,610
So this comes from my Twitter.
15

16
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:12,710
And you can also go to your own Twitter or your Facebook and you can right click on the image and simply
16

17
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,010
copy the image address.
17

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,660
Now if I paste it here you can see the whole URL of where that image is located.
18

19
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,650
And if I hit enter my browser will fetch that image from that location.
19

20
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:37,030
So now if I copy this image address or image source and I add it to my website as a HTML element.
20

21
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,700
So just above my h1.
21

22
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,190
So just above my name here.
22

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,580
I want my image to show up.
23

24
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,230
So I'm going to use the image tag and the source.
24

25
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,480
I'm just going to paste in that URL that I got from earlier on.
25

26
00:01:53,570 --> 00:02:00,720
Now the next attribute here that comes up automatically is the alt or the alternative text.
26

27
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:09,440
And this is the case for say if a browser can’t render the image then it will simply display an alternative
27

28
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,740
text to the user to describe what that image was about.
28

29
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:20,600
So I'll just put the alt text as Angela profile picture.
29

30
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,390
Now if you're interested in search engine optimization and getting your web site ranking for certain
30

31
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:32,650
key words this is something that Google looks at to try and figure out what your web page is about.
31

32
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:41,240
So if you're making a web page that's about burrito recipes and you add an alt text that says finished
32

33
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:49,100
burrito product image one then it helps Google to index and figure out that maybe your web page is related
33

34
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,730
when somebody is searching for burrito recipes.
34

35
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,940
All right so let's hit save and let's refresh and check it out.
35

36
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:03,920
And I've now incorporated my first image onto my personal web site so you can either look around for
36

37
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,400
an image of yourself on Facebook or Twitter or anywhere that would host it.
37

38
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:15,890
Alternatively if you can't find any images of yourself on the web which is probably a good thing you
38

39
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:23,270
can also create an account on Photobucket and upload your own picture in order to get a URL and after
39

40
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:31,580
you do so you can simply click on the image and right click to copy the image address and paste it into
40

41
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,170
your source between the quotation marks.
41

42
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,440
It will work exactly the same.
42

43
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,090
There we go.
43

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,300
Angela is now a box of biscuits. Great.
44

45
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:47,810
Now when my browser looks through this file to see how it should load it up and display it when it comes
45

46
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:56,870
across this image tag it has to go and ping the servers of Twitter to try and obtain this image.
46

47
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:03,620
And if it gets permission to download this image then they will grab that image and display it over
47

48
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,030
here.
48

49
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:12,170
So currently my image is hosted on Twitter's servers and my browser has to download it from there in
49

50
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,780
order to display it inside my web page.
50

51
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:23,210
Now what if Twitter goes down, what if they die, what if nobody wants to send tweets anymore.
51

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,290
Well then their server is going to be shut down.
52

53
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:33,860
And my image will no longer be available for download and you will instead end up with something that
53

54
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,660
looks a little bit like this and you might have come across it in the past when you've been loading
54

55
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,750
up Web sites.
55

56
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:47,420
It means that the image is no longer available or is no longer hosted at the address that’s specified
56

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,870
in the source.
57

58
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:57,430
So in order to remove our reliance on Twitter we can also put an image into our folder
58

59
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,870
HTML - Personal Site and refer to it inside our source.
59

60
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,670
So let's go ahead and do that.
60

61
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:11,120
Now if I go onto my desktop inside Web Development inside the folder HTML - Personal Site 
61

62
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:20,570
I can drag and drop or paste an image of me into this folder and now my index.html and my picture
62

63
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,760
called angela.png is in the same folder and I can refer to it inside my code.
63

64
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:36,500
So instead of using a web address as the source of my image I can simply refer to the file name because
64

65
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:44,150
they are at the same level so index.html and angela.png are at the same hierarchical level. They’re both
65

66
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,430
inside my site.
66

67
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:57,930
Now if I had an images folder and I put my image into there then I would have to add a path to get there.
67

68
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,240
So it would be something like this.
68

69
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,440
Now both ways work and you can do it either way you like.
69

70
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:13,620
And now if you hit save and you go to my site you'll notice this image change from square which is what
70

71
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,880
it got from Twitter to circular which is what it got from my local file.
71

72
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,780
Now in my case I cropped my image to a circle using Photoshop.
72

73
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:30,840
But if you wanted to create your own circular image you can use a tool like crop-circle.imageonline.co
73

74
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,100
crop-circle.imageonline.co
74

75
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,980
And here you'll be able to upload an image and crop the part of the image that you're interested and
75

76
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,890
get it as a circle and be able to download it to use it in your website.
76

77
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,200
And there we go.
77

78
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:50,340
We've managed to brighten up our homepage by adding an image of ourselves to the top of it using the
78

79
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:57,360
image tag and we've started to look at these HTML attributes and you can see that every single
79

80
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:04,260
HTML element in the MDN in reference also has a section on attributes and we're really only touching
80

81
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,870
the surface here because there's other attributes that you can add to the image element or most other
81

82
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,600
elements that you decide to use.
82

83
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:17,750
And we're gonna be looking at these attributes as we come across them for different HTML elements.
83

84
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,880
Now in the next lesson we're going to be looking at anchor tags and how we can start adding links into
84

85
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:30,330
our website and how we can create new pages that can be linked to from our homepage.
85

86
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,360
So for all of that and more I'll see you on the next lesson.
