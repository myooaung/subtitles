0
1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,360
Now we're getting really really close to the end result now.
1

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:11,850
And all we need to do is start getting our Skills section laid out in a way that looks a little bit
2

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,100
better than this.
3

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,440
So the first thing to notice is that, if I switch on Pesticide, you can see that we've got the Skills
4

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,900
section, and inside the Skills section,
5

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,070
there’s two divs. And if you look in the code then you'll see exactly the same structure here.
6

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:36,180
So this div is the Skills div, which contains two further divs, which are the Skill rows. And if you prefer
7

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,320
to visualize this a little bit easier by seeing which is the opening tag for the div and which one is
8

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,450
the closing one,
9

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:53,500
you can actually head into Atom and change your preferences in your Editor section to show the indent guides.
10

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:01,020
So now you can see that you've got these lines that show you which div matches with which closing element.
11

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,830
Now I actually prefer this off just because I find it too cluttery.
12

13
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,320
But it all depends on how you wish to visualize it.
13

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,840
But the important thing is that we've got these two divs that represent two skill-rows and I want you
14

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,450
to make each skill-row have only 50 percent of the width of the screen.
15

16
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,710
So at the moment it's 100 percent because it's a block element.
16

17
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,980
But I want you to change that to make it only 50 percent.
17

18
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,230
So pause the video and complete the challenge.
18

19
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,670
All right so this shouldn't be too hard. If we head into our styles.css, and we go ahead and add our
19

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,720
skill-row, and just make sure that you check to see if you've got any typos between the way it's named
20

21
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,610
here in the class attribute and the way that you've targeted it over here.
21

22
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:04,940
So we wanted to change the width to 50 percent, and we can hit save and refresh, and you can see that
22

23
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:11,180
even though our width for the div is down 50 percent because it's no longer 100 percent,
23

24
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,720
it’s no longer centered in the middle of our web site.
24

25
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,480
So how can we fix this?
25

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:26,390
We've seen this before, and as a challenge I want you to restore this skill-row to the center of the
26

27
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,180
web page.
27

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,140
So pause the video and see if you can figure out how to do that.
28

29
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:38,840
So as we've seen before, the way that we achieve this is by setting the margin to be auto on the left
29

30
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,320
and on the right.
30

31
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,400
So let's go ahead and do that.
31

32
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,770
So we can set the margin for this skill-row to be auto.
32

33
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:55,100
And that just means auto on all four sides, which will center it if we refresh our web page.
33

34
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:02,340
Now at the moment that div is a little bit too close to the top heading and to the next div.
34

35
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:10,010
So how can you change the margin property so that we end up with a 100 pixel margin at the top and 100
35

36
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,840
pixel margin at the bottom,
36

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,770
but keeping this margin auto on the left and right?
37

38
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,960
Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge.
38

39
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,440
All right.
39

40
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,890
So this goes back to the circle shorthand.
40

41
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:31,280
So if we start from the top as we always do we're going to add a 100 pixel margin at the top.
41

42
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,130
Next we come clockwise to the right which we want to keep as auto.
42

43
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,630
Next we go down to the bottom which we said again we want 100 pixels margin.
43

44
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,810
And finally we have the left which we are going to set as auto.
44

45
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,440
So the left and the right are auto, our top and the bottom are 100 pixels.
45

46
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,870
Let's hit save and let's refresh and we can see that margin now in action.
46

47
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,810
Now the next thing I want you to do is, I want this text, both the part for the Design & Development
47

48
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,500
as well as the description text, to be left aligned.
48

49
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:14,180
So can you figure out which property you need to change and where in order to make that happen.
49

50
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,980
So pause the video and complete the challenge.
50

51
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,960
Right. So all we need to do is to go into the skill-row and change the text-align property.
51

52
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,810
Remember we changed this previously to make the text center aligned for most of the body.
52

53
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,870
And that in itself aligned the images to be centered as well as all of our text.
53

54
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,500
But in this skill-row here, we want the text to be left aligned, so we can change that value to left
54

55
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,160
and that will override the center text-align in the body.
55

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,770
So now if we hit refresh, you can see the text inside the Skills section is now left aligned,
56

57
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,040
but outside of it it’s still center aligned.
57

58
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,130
Now the next thing I want to do is to make the paragraphs of the text in here a little bit more spaced
58

59
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,120
apart by changing the line height.
59

60
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,390
So can you double the line height by changing the line height property? So
60

61
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,990
pause the video and complete the challenge.
61

62
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,610
All right. So in this case we're again going to be inside the skill-row and we're changing the line-height
62

63
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,160
property to 2.
63

64
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:32,730
And remember in this case we don't actually have any units and we're simply specifying a scale.
64

65
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,770
Let's hit refresh.
65

66
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,790
And you can see that our text is now a lot more spaced out and much easier to read.
66

67
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:45,330
Now the last thing I want to do before we look into the positioning of our skill-row is we need this image
67

68
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,900
to be a lot smaller.
68

69
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,450
So go ahead and change the width of the image to 25 percent.
69

70
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:57,740
All right.
70

71
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,820
So in order to target the image we need to specify their class names.
71

72
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,770
So one is called code-img and one is called chilli-img.
72

73
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,800
Now this is just the classes that I've added for my own images.
73

74
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,110
You might have named these classes differently because you might have different images.
74

75
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,520
Just check what you have as your class name before you start implementing this and make sure that it
75

76
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,330
works.
76

77
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:28,020
So I'm going to cluster that with the other images, and the first one is called code-img, and I want
77

78
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:35,790
to change the width to 25 percent of its parent, and the next one is the chilli-img,
78

79
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,610
and this again is going to have a width of 25 percent.
79

80
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:47,190
Let's hit save and let's refresh and you can see that they are now the same size even though they weren't
80

81
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:54,150
before because they're now scaled down based on the width of their parent which in this case is actually
81

82
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,330
the skill-row.
82

83
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:02,220
So it's now a quarter the width of the skill-row, which itself is only 50 percent the width of the
83

84
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,320
entire page.
84

85
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,110
So now comes the really interesting thing.
85

86
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,910
How can I make my text wrap around my image?
86

87
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,320
So I want this skill-row to be a lot stouter,
87

88
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,750
so less in height, and I want this image to be on the left but I want my text to be on the right of the
88

89
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,830
image and wrapping around the image as necessary.
89

90
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:34,560
Well, this is where the topic of this lesson comes in and that is of course floating. So we can make
90

91
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:43,240
the image float to the left of the text and make the text wrap around it by simply changing one property.
91

92
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,560
And that is the float property.
92

93
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:54,960
So if we go into our code-img and we change the float property to float left and we hit save, once
93

94
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,650
we refresh you'll see that our image is now on the left of our skill-row,
94

95
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:10,100
and our text is now wrapping around the image in order to display both of these on the same line.
95

96
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,720
Now it looks a little bit odd having the text right up next to the image.
96

97
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:22,440
So can you figure out a way of having 30 pixels of space between this text and this image?
97

98
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,840
So pause the video and see if you can complete the challenge.
98

99
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:33,330
Now there's a couple of ways you can do this, you can think about padding or margin.
99

100
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:39,810
In this case in order to apply a margin to the text it would be kind of difficult because they're completely
100

101
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,020
separate at the moment.
101

102
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,560
We've got an h3 and we've got a paragraph.
102

103
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,720
Now you could add a div to wrap them together and add a left margin to that div.
103

104
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,380
But what's much easier is to simply add a margin-right to our image.
104

105
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:05,900
So let's head into our code and change the code-img margin-right property to 30 pixels.
105

106
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:13,350
And once we refresh you'll see that our image now has a bit of space between it and the text and the
106

107
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,960
text, because it's wrapping around and now it has less width to be displayed,
107

108
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,820
it’s actually taking up the full width of that div.
108

109
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,820
And this looks a lot better than previously.
109

110
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:34,710
Now as a challenge I want you to use the same principles of floating to make this image appear on the
110

111
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,440
right over here,
111

112
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:43,170
and for the text to wrap around that image and to have the same amounts of 30 pixels of space between
112

113
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,840
the image and the text.
113

114
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,440
So pause the video now and see if you can complete this challenge.
114

115
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,640
All right.
115

116
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,320
So pretty much the same principles here.
116

117
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:59,700
But in this case we're not floating left anymore because we want it to be on the right of the text.
117

118
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,540
So in that case we have to change the float property to right instead of left.
118

119
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,670
And that will mean that the text will wrap around the image on the left and then we just have to add
119

120
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:19,590
in that margin-left of 30 pixels on the image in order to get it to have the same amount of space as
120

121
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,110
we had up here.
121

122
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:29,520
So this is looking pretty sweet and we're getting very very close to our end result that we're looking
122

123
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,950
for.
123

124
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:36,510
Now sometimes when you float an element you might not want all of the text to be wrapped around it.
124

125
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:44,700
So for example say if we only wanted that title to wrap around this image and to be on the right of
125

126
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:52,200
the image then we can actually use another property to make sure that this text does not wrap and end
126

127
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,250
up at the bottom
127

128
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,870
over here, below the image, and that property is called clear.
128

129
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:07,080
So if I target the paragraph here. Let’s give it a class. Let’s call it, maybe, code-skill-description, and
129

130
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,940
I'm just going to copy and paste it down here.
130

131
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:21,350
And if I use the clear property to clear its left side then that prevents it from wrapping anything
131

132
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,660
on the left.
132

133
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:27,040
So let's go ahead and try that clear left.
133

134
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,970
Hit save, refresh.
134

135
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:35,510
You can see that that paragraph is now pushed to below the image which is floating but that heading,
135

136
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:40,530
that h3, is still wrapping around the image that's floated to the left.
136

137
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:47,160
If you think about clear as almost like the anti float then that starts to make a little bit more sense.
137

138
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:53,170
So we're saying that float this image to the left and all text will wrap around it on the right.
138

139
00:11:53,390 --> 00:12:01,190
But for this paragraph we said to clear it's left which means make sure that that left margin is clear
139

140
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,350
and not wrapped around anything, then that basically prevents it from carrying out the default behavior.
140

141
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:16,640
Now as a challenge, can you make this paragraph appear below this image rather than wrapped around it?
141

142
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,350
Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge.
142

143
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,590
All right. So, it's exactly the same concept here.
143

144
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,610
Now let's go ahead and just give that paragraph a class.
144

145
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,420
Let's call this chilli-skill-description.
145

146
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,100
And again I'm going to copy it,
146

147
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,200
save the file and paste it down here.
147

148
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,660
And of course remember that dot in front because it's a class.
148

149
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,370
And in this case I still need to use clear,
149

150
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,150
but I have to clear it’s right side in order to make sure it doesn't wrap around the image, because you
150

151
00:12:54,150 --> 00:13:00,120
can see that if I tried the same thing and I cleared its left side nothing changes because it's not
151

152
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,870
wrapping anything on its left.
152

153
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:10,200
But if I change this to right then you'll see that it now appears below the image and it's prevented
153

154
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,500
from wrapping the image that's floated to the right.
154

155
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:22,920
Now I'm actually going to go ahead and clear both of these CSS rules because I actually prefer
155

156
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:28,160
the look that we had previously and I'm going to get rid of these classes as well.
156

157
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,350
And this is the final result that we want to keep.
157

158
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,000
Now as they say with great power comes great responsibility.
158

159
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,270
Float is one of the most commonly used and abused CSS properties.
159

160
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,350
The thing to remember is that it has a whole bunch of corner cases.
160

161
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:57,950
And I recommend to only use float when really really necessary and only use it for what it's meant, which
161

162
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:04,040
is wrapping text around a certain element, and don't use it for positioning.
162

163
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,750
Instead use what we learned about positioning like relative or absolute positioning or using the margin
163

164
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,670
and the padding for the layout and the positioning of your web site and to leave the float property only
164

165
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,870
for the cases of wrapping text.
165

166
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:25,550
Then you will surely get into less trouble and less problems than if you try to use a float
166

167
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:32,470
just as a sort of free for all layout property, which you see a lot of people mistakenly do.
167

168
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:40,970
So we are really really close to the end of this module and in the next section I've got a challenge
168

169
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:49,340
for you to look at a specification of how we want the web site to be finally laid out, and instead of
169

170
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,780
me guiding you step by step through all the little properties that you need to change,
170

171
00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:00,350
I want you to figure out what you need to change in order to achieve the layout that I've specified.
171

172
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:07,340
So in the next lesson you'll see text instructions for you to complete the final big challenge and get
172

173
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,510
this web site looking beautiful.
173

174
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,990
So for all of that I will see you on the next lesson.
