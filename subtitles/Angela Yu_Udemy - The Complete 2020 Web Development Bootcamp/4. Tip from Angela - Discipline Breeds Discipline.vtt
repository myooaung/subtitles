Hey well done for completing yet another module.
1

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.860
You're really really getting the hang of this. Now,
2

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:20.080
in this roommie catchup that we have, I wanna talk to you about discipline because, you know like a lot of
3

4
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.290
people mistake motivation, like the concept of motivation, for excitement.
4

5
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.490
Like you ask yourself you know if I want to be a programmer so much like why am I just not like jumping
5

6
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:40.660
out of bed and wanting to code, you know. Like those days do happen and I have those days too. Like
6

7
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.700
there are days when I wake up early and I think I can't wait to work on this project.
7

8
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:56.500
But there's also days where I like wake up and like I don't want to look at a computer for a year. So
8

9
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:07.210
you know like at the end of the day, motivation is about you wanting to do something because you're trying
9

10
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.460
to get someplace.
10

11
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.080
You're trying to achieve your goals.
11

12
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.780
Now this might be a good time to have a look back at the goals that you wrote out in the first module.
12

13
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.920
Like why are you doing this?
13

14
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:29.740
Because in these moments when motivation is low, then you have to look at the reasons for why you're putting
14

15
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.020
in this work right?
15

16
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:40.870
And in most cases what it comes down to is just discipline, like you've got to have the discipline to
16

17
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.820
just sit down and do the work and put in the hours and the great thing about discipline though is that
17

18
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.460
discipline breeds discipline.
18

19
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:59.260
The more that you do it, the easier it gets. The more that you sit down every day, do an hour of coding,
19

20
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.120
the easier it is on subsequent days in order to keep doing this.
20

21
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:14.100
So you're doing the right thing, just plough on and me and the office unicorn and the office crustacean
21

22
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.890
we're both gonna be here cheering on for you.
22

23
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.200
So keep going and you'll get there.
