0
1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:00,920
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,440
So in the last lesson you would have heard about the pros and cons of SQL databases as well
2

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,920
as noSQL databases but nothing is truer than having tried it yourself.
3

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,800
So let's have a go at creating a database using a SQL  based database and seeing for ourselves exactly
4

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,770
how it works.
5

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:27,150
A great resource in terms of documentation for a SQL is on w3schools.
6

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:33,960
So if you head over to w3schools.com/sql or just hit the tab here
7

8
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:42,530
then you can see all of the SQL or the Structured Query Language syntax being documented here and
8

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:48,670
it's a really good guide on getting familiar with this essentially new programming language. The way
9

10
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:58,180
the SQL works is you have these keywords such as SELECT or FROM or CREATE or TABLE and you tend
10

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:05,140
to write them in uppercase and using this Structured Query Language we can create tables, manipulate
11

12
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,430
them, update, destroy, etc..
12

13
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:15,520
Now with every single type of database the main things that you'll be doing with it is simply create,
13

14
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,070
read, update, destroy. Or in database lingo
14

15
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,630
it's known as CRUD.
15

16
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,430
So for every single database the first thing to do is to get yourself used to doing CRUD using that
16

17
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,680
particular database.
17

18
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,350
So let's try it out with a SQL based database.
18

19
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,100
In the resources for this lesson you will find a link to
19

20
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,340
sqliteonline
20

21
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,530
.com
21

22
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:51,010
and this is a website that creates a playground environment which allows you to try out using a SQL 
22

23
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:57,640
like database and to get familiar with some of the query language and just see how it works.
23

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:05,300
If you click on the link you will get taken to this database where I've  already created a single table called customers.
24

25
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,230
And if you right click on customers and click on Show table then you can see that it's got two rows
25

26
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:18,970
or two records already pre-populated. There's only four fields or four columns and that's the id, the
26

27
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,010
first name, last name, and the address of our customer.
27

28
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,550
The first thing we're going to do is we're going to replicate that table structure that we saw earlier
28

29
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,780
on in the last lesson.
29

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:36,780
We're going to recreate this Products table that we had but this time using real SQL code.
30

31
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,860
So what do we do whenever we need to do something with a new piece of technology?
31

32
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,680
We check out the documentation.
32

33
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:48,040
If you scroll through this left side pane, you can see that there's a whole lot of different things that
33

34
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,800
you can do.
34

35
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,610
But in this case we want to create a new table to store our products.
35

36
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,950
And if you scroll through it you'll find this section called SQL Create Table. And here is the syntax
36

37
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,690
for how you would create a table using SQL.
37

38
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,670
So the key word here are in all caps and that's CREATE TABLE.
38

39
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:15,130
And then we provide a name for the table and then we open a set of parentheses and inside the parentheses
39

40
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,170
we detail the names of each column and the data type that it will contain.
40

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,970
And these are separated by commas.
41

42
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,140
So let's try and create this table using what we just learned.
42

43
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,390
If we head into our SQL-like browser and would delete all the code that's in this section and we're
43

44
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,780
going to write our own SQL code.
44

45
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,320
So remember the key words were CREATE and TABLE.
45

46
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,370
So this creates a new table and then we provide the name of our table.
46

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,170
So it's going to be called products and then we open a set of parentheses,
47

48
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:57,260
so round brackets. And inside the round brackets we add in all of the names and the data types of our
48

49
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,320
columns.
49

50
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,950
So the first one is going to be an id
50

51
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:07,870
and this is going to be an integer data type and that is going to store the unique id or the primary
51

52
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,600
key for our products table.
52

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:18,150
So we'll be able to identify each row by its id. The next one we're going to call name
53

54
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,650
and this is going to be a string.
54

55
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,470
Now remember we're not writing Javascript here anymore
55

56
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:30,300
so there's no colons and there's actually just a space between the name and the data type.
56

57
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,880
And there's a comma in between each one of these columns.
57

58
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,320
The next one we need to store is the price of a particular product.
58

59
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,930
And so it's going to be called price.
59

60
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,900
But the data type is actually going to be something slightly different because we want to store a data
60

61
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,990
type that is going to hold a monetary value.
61

62
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,570
If you head back to the documentation and you scroll all the way down you can see that there's a reference
62

63
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,810
for SQL data types and there's loads and loads of different data types.
63

64
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,220
The most commonly used ones are things such as string or text or characters of a particular size.
64

65
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:15,670
So if you said cha (255) then it can only store up to 255 characters and you can limit your
65

66
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,250
data in that way.
66

67
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:24,210
Now if you scroll down to the number data types, you can see one of these is really applicable to us.
67

68
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,250
We can use a data type such as money or even small money to save our data type.
68

69
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:36,550
And this will make it formatted in the same way that most prices are formatted with commas and decimal
69

70
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,460
places.
70

71
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:46,990
Let's go back and let's say that the data format for price is going to be of type money. The final thing
71

72
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:53,980
that we're going to add to our schema or the structure of our table is something called a primary key.
72

73
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:01,750
Again scrolling through the documentation you will find a section on SQL primary keys. And what this
73

74
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:10,380
does is it allows a particular column to uniquely identify each record in a database.
74

75
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:17,530
So that means that this record here with name of pen and price of 1.20 will be uniqueli
75

76
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,580
identified by this 1 and there won't be another product with the id of 1.
76

77
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:30,520
So whenever we say products with id of 1 then it refers to one specific record. And to do this we
77

78
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:38,830
have to set a particular column as the primary key for the table. In order to do that using SQL 
78

79
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,210
you can see that we have to write the word primary key,
79

80
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,710
so these are special keywords,
80

81
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:52,840
and then inside a set of parentheses we specify the field that is going to be the primary key which
81

82
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,130
in our case is going to be this one called id.
82

83
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:05,910
So let's go ahead and add primary key and a set of parentheses and then the name of the field on the column
83

84
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,740
that is going to be the primary key.
84

85
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,340
So in our case it's again id.
85

86
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,070
Now if you see in this documentation something else you might notice is that for when they created their
86

87
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:22,280
id field, they added another keyword next to it which is not null.
87

88
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:28,590
This guarantees that whenever new records are being created inside this table if the record doesn't
88

89
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:34,080
provide an ID then it will not allow it to be created so it cannot be null.
89

90
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,810
And this makes a lot of sense when you're setting a field as a primary key because if you had a record
90

91
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,590
that didn't even have an ID then that will be a big problem when you try to identify it later on.
91

92
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,200
So let's go ahead and do that for our field as well.
92

93
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:58,370
Let's make our ID field not null. Now that we've created the schema for our new table called  products
93

94
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:04,180
we can go ahead, check to make sure that we've got a comma between each of these fields that we don't
94

95
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,370
have any colons anywhere
95

96
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:13,370
and then we can go ahead and click run. All going well you should end up with a new table.
96

97
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,930
Now if you end up with some errors down here with error messages then make sure you read the error message
97

98
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,200
and take a look back at the video and make sure that you haven't got any typos anywhere and that everything
98

99
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,460
looks exactly the same as what you see on the screen.
99

100
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,160
So now let's go ahead and check out this table products.
100

101
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,580
So let's click on Show table and you can see we currently don't have anything for our table.
101

102
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,310
It's completely empty.
102

103
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,250
So we have to add some data into it.
103

104
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:50,160
The data that we want to add is an id of 1, name of Pen and a price of 1.20.
104

105
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:58,530
Let's head back to our documentation and if you click on a SQL insert into, then you'll find the documentation
105

106
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:06,230
for how to add data or insert data into your table. As they say
106

107
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,330
there's two ways of inserting data.
107

108
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:15,270
One is you write INSERT INTO table_name and then you provide the names of the columns that you want
108

109
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,860
to insert data to and then you provide the values one by one.
109

110
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,120
Now this is a little bit more roundabout.
110

111
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:29,070
If you were to insert values for each and every single column, then you don't actually need this part
111

112
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,390
and you can simply just specify all the values.
112

113
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,260
Let's go ahead and do that for our product table.
113

114
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:44,210
So again let's delete this line and we're going to write INSERT INTO and then the name of our table
114

115
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:50,100
which is products with an 's' and then we're going to provide the values.
115

116
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,430
And this is going to be contained inside a set of parentheses and then we separate each of the values
116

117
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,550
with a comma.
117

118
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:03,980
The first value is going to be the id which is going to be 1 and then the second value is the string
118

119
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,800
that is pen.
119

120
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:11,720
So because it's a string it also has to be inside some quotation marks and we're going to put the string
120

121
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,600
that is pen and the last item is the price which is £1.20
121

122
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,420
if you remember.
122

123
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,130
So now check your code.
123

124
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:27,340
Make sure that there's nothing at the end of the sentence especially no semicolons because this is
124

125
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,350
actually expressed in SQL on pretty much the same line.
125

126
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:37,500
It's a single line statement but you'll often see it separated like this to make it easier to read.
126

127
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,580
Once you've checked your code go ahead and hit run.
127

128
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:45,730
And that should have added this value into our products.
128

129
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:52,960
So now if you right click on products and hit show table we now have a single record that is the product
129

130
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:59,420
name Pen, price 1.20 with an id of one.
130

131
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:06,630
Now if we wanted to skip a field so for example if we were to add another record which is not the product
131

132
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,900
we have which is pencil but at the moment we haven't yet priced up the pencils so we don't have a value
132

133
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:23,700
for its price yet. If we wanted to insert into our table products but we don't yet have the value for all
133

134
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,140
of the columns
134

135
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:32,250
then you can simply open up a set of parentheses as you see over here and provide the names of the columns
135

136
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,790
that you have values for.
136

137
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:41,610
So we can insert into our products table the data that we have by specifying the columns that we have
137

138
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,260
data for.
138

139
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:48,150
So in this case we have data for the column for ID as well as name but that's it.
139

140
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:55,080
We don't have the price data. And The values will be contained in a set of parentheses and the id will
140

141
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,490
be 2 and the name will be the string that is
141

142
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,210
Pencil. And now make sure you check your code.
142

143
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:08,660
Make sure that all the key words are colored purple and in all caps and then go ahead and hit run.
143

144
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,370
And now when we show our products table again then you can see the second record has an id, has a name
144

145
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,060
but it doesn't have a price.
145

146
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:25,820
Price is actually null right now. Now remember earlier on when we created our products schema,
146

147
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:33,450
so you if right click and say SQL schema, you can see that the id field cannot be null.
147

148
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:43,620
So if we were to write the code for our products table and we said something like INSERT INTO products
148

149
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:55,190
but we were only going to insert into the field that's name and price then provide the values which
149

150
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:01,820
is, I don't know, Rubber and 1.30.
150

151
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:10,250
If I hit run you'll see that I get an error in here and it says, 'NOT NULL constraint failed'.
151

152
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,130
It's because products.id cannot be null.
152

153
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,310
And in this case we're making it NULL because we're not providing a value for it when we're creating
153

154
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,780
this new record.
154

155
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:27,020
This is just a little bit of validation to keep your database well organized and following the structure
155

156
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,420
that we specified.
156

157
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:35,200
So that was how you would create a new table using the Structured Query Language and also how you would
157

158
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,090
start inserting pieces of data into your table. In the next lesson
158

159
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:45,850
we're going to look at how we would read and how we would search through our table to find particular
159

160
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,020
pieces of data.
