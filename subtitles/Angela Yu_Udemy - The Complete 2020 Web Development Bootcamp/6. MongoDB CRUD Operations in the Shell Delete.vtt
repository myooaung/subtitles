00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.410
So previously we've seen how to create, read and update using MongoDB in the Mongo shell. And now
1

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.000
it's time to look at how we would delete data from our collections.
2

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.170
And again if I scroll down in this CRUD documentation we've got a section that tells us how to do this.
3

4
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.650
And you can see that the two main methods we'll rely on is deleteOne and deleteMany.
4

5
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.370
And this is an example of how you would use it.
5

6
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:35.460
So you would say db.collection name.deleteMany or deleteOne and  in the filter you would specify
6

7
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.510
which records you want to delete.
7

8
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.700
This is a good opportunity to translate what you see in the documentation to actual working code that
8

9
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.750
does what you want it to.
9

10
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.490
I want you to remove this second record that we added which is the pencil record by reading and using
10

11
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.590
the documentation on MongoDB.
11

12
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.160
Pause the video now and give that a try.
12

13
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.120
OK.
13

14
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.920
As we saw over here all we need to implement is db.collection
14

15
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:15.520
.deleteOne. And we're going to say db.products.deleteOne and then we're going to provide
15

16
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.850
the filter to find the particular record that we want to delete which in our case it would be easier
16

17
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.850
to just specify the id
17

18
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.950
and in this case that's going to be equal to 2.
18

19
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.150
So now if I hit enter then you can see that my request has been acknowledged and one record has been
19

20
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.040
deleted.
20

21
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.070
And now if we use that find method again you can see we only have one record in our products collection.
