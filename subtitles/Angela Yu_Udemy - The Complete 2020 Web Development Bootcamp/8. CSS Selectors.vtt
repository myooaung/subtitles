00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:10.710
Now in the last lesson we looked at the simplest type of CSS selectors and that is selecting based
1

2
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.200
on the HTML tags.
2

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.900
Now in this lesson I want to show you the other things that you can use as selectors in order to make
3

4
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.000
more specific changes to your web site. 
4

5
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.870
So for example we have this image of a piece of bacon.
5

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.930
Now what if I wanted to have another image that was a broccoli and I want to show people how much I
6

7
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.280
dislike broccoli.
7

8
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.170
Then I could go to emojipedia and I could search for a broccoli and I found my broccoli.
8

9
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.320
And this is a really cool web site because it lists all of the emoji graphics from different operating
9

10
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.070
systems.
10

11
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.420
So this is Apple's version of a broccoli emoji.
11

12
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.390
And this is Google's. This is Microsoft. Not sure that this really looks.
12

13
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.450
This looks more like a tree than a broccoli.
13

14
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.500
But feel free to go through this list and see what emoji you prefer.
14

15
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.120
I quite like this one I think it's most realistic.
15

16
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.650
And then just go ahead and right click and copy the image address and we're going to use that as the source
16

17
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.810
of our image.
17

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.460
And you can see up here.
18

19
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.800
This is exactly the same way how I got the image for our bacon and I'm just going to add an alt text
19

20
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.150
just in case the image doesn't display.
20

21
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.260
And I'm going to say this is the broccoli-img.
21

22
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:37.400
So now if I hit save and I go to my bacon fansite you can see that my broccoli now shows up.
22

23
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.590
But the curious thing is that my broccoli also has a red background
23

24
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.380
even though I just put it on screen, I didn’t even have time to look at the styles yet.
24

25
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.900
So why is that.
25

26
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.020
Well if we take a look inside style.css you can see that by targeting the image tag,
26

27
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.150
we’re applying this red background color to every single image inside our web site.
27

28
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.900
And that might be what you want but in most cases that's not really specific enough.
28

29
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.770
And in my case what I'd like to do is that I want to have the bacon to have a green background color
29

30
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.670
to say eat more bacon.
30

31
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.110
And the broccoli to have a red background color to say broccoli is evil.
31

32
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.090
So how can I achieve that.
32

33
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.090
Well I can’t do that just by using tag selectors.
33

34
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.690
So I have to go a little bit more advanced in my CSS and I have to use class selectors.
34

35
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.420
So if you head into index.html and after the image tag we're going to add another attribute.
35

36
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.860
So remember HTML attributes are things like the source or the alt tag etc..
36

37
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.700
And the one that we want to add now is the class attribute.
37

38
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.610
Now the class attribute allows us to differentiate all of our different HTML elements.
38

39
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.530
So for example for this bacon image I'm going to give the class a name of bacon.
39

40
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.000
And for the broccoli image I'm going to name this class broccoli.
40

41
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.190
So now what I can do is instead of coloring all the images red so I'm going to go ahead and comment
41

42
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.040
this out.
42

43
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.960
So in CSS commenting is a little bit different from HTML in the sense that we have to use a forward slash
43

44
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:45.840
a asterisk and then to end the block of comments we use another asterisk and a forward slash.
44

45
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.830
So everything in between the asterisks will be commented out and won't be considered as code.
45

46
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.690
So let's give our css files some sections, shall we?
46

47
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.330
Let's say that the top section are our tag selectors.
47

48
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.480
And the next section are our class selectors.
48

49
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:18.090
So inside this section I'm going to tap into that bacon class in order to only change the styling for
49

50
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.470
the bacon image and give it a background color of green.
50

51
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:32.910
So to target a class rather than a tag the only difference is a full stop or a dot in front of the class.
51

52
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.760
So my class is called bacon.
52

53
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.900
So to use it as a selector I just say .bacon and the rest of the CSS rule looks exactly the same.
53

54
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.820
And I'm going to say that for the bacon class I want the background color to be green.
54

55
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.380
But for the broccoli class.
55

56
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.260
Now make sure you don't have any typos because if you misspell the selector, the property or the
56

57
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.250
value you might not get what you expect.
57

58
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.440
For example what I've done here because they all need to be spelt exactly the same way as you spelt
58

59
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.440
it inside
59

60
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.000
your html code when you gave the class a name.
60

61
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.380
So for our broccoli image we want the background color to be red.
61

62
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.230
So now if we hit save then what's going to happen is that different styles will be applied to our two images.
62

63
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.570
So even though they’re both image html elements, because this one has a class of bacon it's going to have
63

64
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.330
a background color of green as we specified.
64

65
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.020
And because this one has a class of broccoli it's going to have a background color of red.
65

66
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.790
So let's just quickly verify and there we go.
66

67
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.890
We've got our bacon that's colored in green telling you how healthy it is.
67

68
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.250
We've got broccoli colored in red telling you how it's probably not edible.
68

69
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:06.110
So for things like paragraph elements or image elements or anchor tags then it's very very rare that
69

70
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.580
you'll want to style them exactly the same way.
70

71
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:18.650
So by using the class as the selector you can better differentiate and and make more specific styling
71

72
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.540
choices for your web site elements.
