Hey it's Angela again.
1

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:10,430
And if you're seeing my video then that means you've completed another module so pat yourself on the
2

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:10,830
back
3

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:18,260
if nobody else is going to do it and congratulate yourself on really showing up and getting the work
4

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,960
done.
5

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,630
Now I want to talk a little bit about sort of going beyond your own limitations.
6

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:36,360
So in terms of my own story when my parents first relocated to the UK I was very young.
7

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:46,500
I was about 10 years old and at the time they didn't really have the foresight to teach me any English.
8

9
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:53,510
So when I first arrived and went to school, I couldn't say anything.
9

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,880
I didn't even know hello like that was the extent of my knowledge.
10

11
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,110
And it was a real struggle.
11

12
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:08,800
And you know there were long periods of time where I thought like you know I'm kind of just done for
12

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,050
now. I'm never going to be good at school because I can't understand what people are saying.
13

14
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,110
I'm really going to struggle making friends because they don't understand what I'm saying.
14

15
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:27,130
But you know at one point I realized well, is this the life I want to live like?
15

16
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,670
Am I just gonna be some sort of recluse
16

17
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,330
like for the rest of my life or am I just gonna go and try?
17

18
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:41,920
So I ended up just trying to use the few words that I had to talk to people
18

19
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,070
and surprisingly I made friends even though I really didn't actually understand what they were saying
19

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,440
especially things like British sarcasm and British humor.
20

21
00:01:52,510 --> 00:02:00,340
And it was they used a lot of air quotes all the time. So you know kids can be cruel but like you are also
21

22
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,520
more willing to try as a child.
22

23
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,290
I think for somebody who's maybe a lot older as if I was at my current age going into a completely new
23

24
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:19,120
environment and being thrown at a task which I felt like I was severely disadvantaged against, maybe
24

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:27,790
I wouldn't have the bravery or the the ability to really just say, you know what? I'm going to overcome
25

26
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,990
this thing you know because I think as we get older it's much easier to blame a lot of things
26

27
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,360
right?
27

28
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:43,960
Like maybe I'm too tall, I'm too short, I'm too thin, I'm too fat, I'm too bad at English, I'm too bad at
28

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,750
Maths. And the number of like things that you can blame on is like limitless.
29

30
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:57,290
There are just so many things and everybody has different things that they focus on. But the point is
30

31
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:05,210
those things don't really help you especially if you decided that something you can't change like your
31

32
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:12,440
gender or your age is the reason why you can't do something then nobody can help you
32

33
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,300
right?
33

34
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:23,640
So even if those things were true like even if life would be easier if you were you know like looked
34

35
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:31,040
like Brad Pitt and you you know had like a really rich family or you know you had all the resources.
35

36
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:37,870
Like even if that was the case, I'm sure those people have their own things that they focus on.
36

37
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,730
So don't focus on things that you can't change, even if they are there.
37

38
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,540
Instead focus on the million other things that you can change.
38

39
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,420
Maybe you can wake up earlier one hour earlier than everybody else,
39

40
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,710
maybe you can work that much harder than everybody else,
40

41
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:06,570
maybe you will just you know like do more repetitions. And you know at the gym the people who are the
41

42
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,070
strongest are not the people who showed up with the most muscles
42

43
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:18,150
the first time they went to a gym. It's the people who go there every day, it's the people who are dedicated,
43

44
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,550
who are motivated.
44

45
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:27,200
And so I guess what I'm trying to say is that you are the master.
45

46
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:35,640
You can determine where your life will go no matter how old you are or how female you are or how male
46

47
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:35,890
you are.
47

48
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:43,000
It doesn't matter. Just focus on things that you can change and those things alone will make a huge difference.
48

49
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:53,370
So, I reckon whatever it is that you decide to do, you can do it. And I'm willing to support you every
49

50
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,180
step of the way.
50

51
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:07,150
And you know if you manage to get to where you are and you're able to overcome a lot of these hurdles
51

52
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:14,110
or you know things that stop you, then you'll become a stronger person and you can take on even bigger
52

53
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,390
challenges and bigger challenges.
53

54
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,920
You know, the world is your oyster.
54

55
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,820
So keep going and keep learning.
