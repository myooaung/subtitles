1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:09,820
Now in the last lesson, we looked at how we can implement a CSS style and apply it to all instances of
1

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,930
a particular HTML element on a single page.
2

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:23,710
So we changed the style for our horizontal rule and by adding this internal CSS to our index.html page
3

4
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,920
we managed to affect the style of all the horizontal rules on the same page.
4

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:37,780
Now we're going to take it one step further and we're going to change our web site that uses internal
5

6
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:47,040
CSS to external CSS and to do that we first have to create a new folder in our personal site.
6

7
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,510
So I'm going to create a new folder that's called simply CSS.
7

8
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:58,450
And inside this folder I'm going to create a new file and that file is going to be called 
8

9
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,570
styles.css.
9

10
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:06,460
So with that extension the browser will recognize it as a CSS file.
10

11
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:14,320
So once you hit Enter you'll see that we have this brand new file called styles.css and we're
11

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:22,740
going to move our code for the body and the horizontal rule over to this page.
12

13
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:28,270
I'm going to hit save and we're going to remove the style tag.
13

14
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:35,020
So now if I hit save and I refresh our web site you can see that all the style that we've applied is now
14

15
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,550
gone because we've deleted it from the style tag in the header.
15

16
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:46,250
Now instead what we're going to do is we're going to create a new link.
16

17
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:55,630
And if you write link and you hit enter then it will autofill to say that this link has a relationship
17

18
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,750
of something called the stylesheet.
18

19
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:07,000
So when your browser reads your web page it'll go from the top to the bottom and once it hits this line
19

20
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,540
it’ll see that "oh this is where the stylesheet for this web page resides".
20

21
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,090
And I can go over here to fetch it.
21

22
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,610
Now we need to change this href to point towards our styles.css.
22

23
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,050
So the first thing we need to change is the file name.
23

24
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,740
Our file’s not called master.css, it’s called styles.css, and the other thing that we
24

25
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,210
have to change is this forward slash here.
25

26
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:41,560
Now if an href starts off with a forward slash then it's pointing towards the root of your web site.
26

27
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,940
It's saying that you'll find this file inside a folder called css
27

28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,330
inside the root of your web site. Now we're going to talk about the root a little bit later on especially
28

29
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,650
once we start getting into Javascript.
29

30
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:01,730
But for now just know that when you have a static web site that's not yet hosted anywhere,
30

31
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,770
you can't tap into this file using the root.
31

32
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:12,730
So instead we're going to say that this file resides in a folder called css and it's on the same level
32

33
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,860
as this current file.
33

34
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:23,680
So index.html is here and on the same level as it there is a folder called css inside of which there
34

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,380
is a file called styles.css and that is going to be our stylesheet.
35

36
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:37,840
So your browser then takes this file here then applies all of these styles to the specified elements
36

37
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,100
inside your index.html.
37

38
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:48,050
So let's hit save and let's refresh our page to make sure that it worked.
38

39
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,990
And it has.
39

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,360
So this is what we call the external CSS.
40

41
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:04,510
And if we apply this style sheet to our Contact Me page as well as our Hobbies page then you'll see
41

42
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:13,900
that once we go to it then you'll see that all of our styles gets applied across all three pages and
42

43
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:21,810
all we have to do is just add this simple link that points towards this external stylesheet.
43

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,340
And anything that we change in this single location will affect all three web pages.
44

45
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,310
So we'll know that the style is consistent across all three pages.
45

46
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:46,510
Now as a challenge I want you to select the h1 and the h3 elements on all three pages and I
46

47
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:52,280
want you to change its color property to this particular color that we had on colorhunt.
47

48
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,620
So 66BFBF.
48

49
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:02,130
And by the end of it you should end up with your site looking similar to this where on all three pages
49

50
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:08,800
the h1s and the h3s are colored in this new shade.
50

51
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:15,660
Now remember if you don't know which CSS property to change or if the property that you're trying to
51

52
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:26,790
change isn't working you can always go to Google and say ‘change text color css’ and that will help you
52

53
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,760
figure out which property you need to change.
53

54
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,340
So go ahead, pause the video and give it a go.
54

55
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:38,870
All right.
55

56
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,670
So how did that go?
56

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,820
Well if you have any difficulty figuring out which property you need to change, because it's a property
57

58
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,840
that we haven't used before,
58

59
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,340
then you needed to look at some of the documentation.
59

60
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,440
And in this case, for example changing the text using CSS,
60

61
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:05,440
the first thing that it talks about is changing the text color, which is exactly what we want to do.
61

62
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:12,470
And it tells you that the property that you need is something called color and you can specify the color
62

63
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:19,240
just as we did before for the background color with a name or with a hex value or with an RGB value.
63

64
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,430
So our value that we had was here, which is 66BFBF,
64

65
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,320
we’re going to copy it and we're going to go into the styles.css,
65

66
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,590
so our external style sheet,
66

67
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:40,650
and we're going to select the element that we want to change which is the h1 as well as the h3.
67

68
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:49,410
And the property that we want to change was called color and the value that we're going to give it is the
68

69
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,790
hex code 66BFBF and we want that to be true
69

70
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,420
in both cases.
70

71
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:04,110
So now if you hit save and you go over to your site and you hit refresh then the black text becomes
71

72
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,720
that nice green turquoise color.
72

73
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,670
And the changes are also reflected in Hobbies and Contact Me.
73

74
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,350
So did you get that right?
74

75
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,270
Did you manage to figure out which property you needed to change?
75

76
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,270
If yes then great.
76

77
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:29,120
Perfect. If you want to take this challenge even further then you can style the text in more ways than
77

78
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,490
we've specified here
78

79
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,330
by looking through the documentation and changing anything that you want to change.
79

80
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,380
So, for example, it's a bit odd to have the h1 the same color as the h3.
80

81
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,260
So you could differentiate those two by making the styles of each of them different.
81

82
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:52,160
Now if you've created something wonderful, wacky, or completely different from what I have then it's a
82

83
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,070
good time to show off what you've done and head over to the Q&amp;A section and show all of your fellow
83

84
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,600
students and post a screenshot of what your web site looks like and which CSS properties you changed
84

85
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,080
in order to achieve it.
85

86
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:13,640
Now in the next lesson we're going to look at some potential bugs that you might come across and ways
86

87
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:20,950
in which you can help yourself by diagnosing what the problem is and how you can fix it yourself.
87

88
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,010
So we're starting to learn about the important skill of debugging.
88

89
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,640
So for all of that and more I'll see you on the next lesson.
