00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.500
So, now that we've spoken about how the Internet works, in this episode I want to talk about: How exactly
1

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.980
do websites work?
2

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.800
What exactly does HTML, CSS and Javascript do exactly?
3

4
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.850
Now, in order to access a web page, we all know that you need a browser, right? And that can be Chrome, Safari,
4

5
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.160
Firefox - whatever is your favorite one.
5

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.810
These are all pieces of software that allow you to look up the IP address of your website and be able
6

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.860
to receive data that it can render into these beautiful websites that we see. Now, the data that you
7

8
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.410
receive from the server usually consists of three types of files:
8

9
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.270
HTML, CSS and Javascript.
9

10
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.570
And it's very likely that you would have come across these types of files or these words before because
10

11
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.490
they're so common and they're so integral to how websites work.
11

12
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.850
But what exactly do they do and why are there so many different types of files?
12

13
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.440
Why can't we just have one file that's, you know, a website?
13

14
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.260
Well, they actually have very different jobs.
14

15
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.520
The HTML code file is responsible for the structure of your web site.
15

16
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.990
So if a website was a house, then the HTML would be the builder who would come in to build the walls
16

17
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.780
or put in a toilet.
17

18
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.630
Basically they establish the structure of your house and when you write HTML code, you also build up the
18

19
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.620
structure of your website. So you could use HTML to add an image or button or text box - whatever it
19

20
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.890
is that you need in your website.
20

21
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.950
Now the second type of files are CSS files. And these files are responsible for styling your website.
21

22
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.740
So, if you are building a house, then this would be the painters and decorators. They would be going around
22

23
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.610
painting the walls or adding stylistic flourishes to your place and generally making the place look
23

24
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.110
the way that you want it to.
24

25
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.380
And that's exactly what CSS code does as well.
25

26
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.000
When you incorporate CSS, it allows you to specify how you want your website to look.
26

27
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.410
So you could say that "Yes, I have a button that I got from my HTML, but that button, I want it to
27

28
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.040
be red. And I want the text to be white. And I want the font of the text to be in Aerial." That is all done
28

29
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.960
using CSS code.
29

30
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.830
Now the final component is the Javascript code. And this is the code that allows your website to actually
30

31
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.410
do things or have behavior.
31

32
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.180
And if you were building a house you would have the electrician come in, who would be able to connect
32

33
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.520
the wires so that your lightbulbs actually switch on. Or somebody who comes in and does the plumbing
33

34
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.360
so that your toilet can actually flush. And the Javascript code does exactly that.
34

35
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.000
It allows your website to actually do things and have behavior.
35

36
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.970
So, for example, that button I added earlier on with my HTML code - only when I have the Javascript
36

37
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.620
code can I actually make it do something interesting like send off an email.
37

38
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.470
So if we take the Google website as an example again. Once we receive these files from Google server
38

39
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.110
when our browser loads up the HTML files, we'll get to see the structure of the website.
39

40
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.900
Namely there's one image which has their logo.
40

41
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.130
There's two buttons. And there's a text box where we can enter our search.
41

42
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.560
Now when we receive the CSS files, then that will modify the appearance of all of those components.
42

43
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.590
We don't have any more buttons or any more images, but they now look the way that Google wanted it to.
43

44
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:41.150
And finally when we incorporate the Javascript files, then our website actually starts having behavior.
44

45
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.540
It has functionality and it's actually able to do something rather than just display some images and text
45

46
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.140
to us.
46

47
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.390
Now, with the knowledge that we've already acquired, we can already start messing around with websites
47

48
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.640
on the Internet.
48

49
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.760
So open up chrome and head over to techcrunch.com.
49

50
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.080
And if you're not familiar with it, it's basically a technology news website where I get my latest tech
50

51
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.780
news.
51

52
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:13.180
Now, once you're over here, I want you to right-click on the title here and click on "Inspect".
52

53
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.760
Now, this brings up the Chrome developer tools. And we're going to be exploring this in a lot more detail.
53

54
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.610
But for now, we're going to use it to do something really simple.
54

55
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.020
You can see that when I right-click on that heading and click "Inspect", it automatically opens up the
55

56
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.100
entire code file that was used to render this website.
56

57
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.740
So these are all of the elements that make up this website.
57

58
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.720
And when you click on "Inspect", it will highlight to you the part of the code that corresponds to the
58

59
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.380
thing that you right-clicked, right?
59

60
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.720
In this case it's this title.
60

61
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.340
And inside this title, you can see that there is a link, which means that when you click on it.
61

62
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.770
It'll go to another web page, but it's also got a bit of text.
62

63
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.580
So right inside Chrome developer tools, if you double click on the bit of text that corresponds to the
63

64
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.640
title, you can actually edit it.
64

65
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.380
So let's go ahead and change the front page of Tech Crunch.
65

66
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.520
Let's say something like ...
66

67
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.400
So this is a great way of pranking your friends. Especially when they can see that you're on
67

68
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.040
techcrunch.com
68

69
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.540
And the title, of any of the text on the website, is what you wanted to say. And this is a great joke
69

70
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.850
to play on friends who are maybe not quite as technologically advanced as you because they haven't taken
70

71
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.330
the course that you have. Now unfortunately
71

72
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.300
when I hit refresh on this website, all of my good work is gone.
72

73
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:49.660
And the reason is because when I'm editing it here, inside my browser, I'm actually changing the local
73

74
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:56.950
copy of this file that I got back from the Google servers. But when I click refresh, then that makes a
74

75
00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.280
new request to the Google servers to load up a fresh copy of the website.
75

76
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.110
So, of course, then it updates to the original content. But in the coming lessons, we're going to be working
76

77
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:15.960
with HTML, CSS and Javascript so that you can create and host - live on the internet - your very own web
77

78
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.340
sites. And through learning how to code and how to build websites, you're going to be able to make websites
78

79
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.250
that say anything that you want it to, look the way that you want it to, and have the functionality that
79

80
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.230
you need.
80

81
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.150
So all of that and more,
81

82
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.780
I'll see you on the next lesson.
