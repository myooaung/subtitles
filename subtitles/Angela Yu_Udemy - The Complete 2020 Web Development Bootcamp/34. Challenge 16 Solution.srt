All right so here comes the answer.
1

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,880
Before you do anything I recommend reading through the docs and seeing how these parameters work.
2

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,390
And remember that we're using the colon and then we're going to give our parameter a name so that we
3

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:21,540
can tap into it later on using req.params. the name that we specified.
4

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,030
So now we can head into our app.js and you can create that route any way you wish.
5

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,930
I'm going to put it just before the end right down here
6

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:36,510
just before my app.listen. And I'm going to say app.get  and then I'm going to specify /
7

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:44,250
posts/: and then here comes the name of my parameter which you can call anything you
8

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,930
wish as long as it makes sense to you
9

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:55,200
but I'll call it postName. And then I'll add my callback, my req and res and then inside my callback I
10

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,070
am going to tap into that parameter called postName.
11

12
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:09,360
So I want to console log it. So I'm going to log the req.params.postName. And it has
12

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,450
to be spelt exactly the same as you see here after the colon.
13

14
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,410
But there's no colons down here
14

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,700
remember that. This is all that you need in order to tap into a dynamic
15

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,890
URL right?
16

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,890
Because we're using this parameter to decide what it is that we should do inside our app.get.
17

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,360
So we can now say if they said I wanted you know the post that has a post name of testing then we will
18

19
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,770
send them over there
19

20
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:43,940
and if they wanted the post that had a name of ordinary I love pets then we will show them that page.
20

21
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,450
So this is the first step towards getting a dynamic website created.
21

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,570
And this is all down to using Node and Express, nothing else.
22

23
00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:01,060
Now we can test this and if we head over to posts/ anything you want to write afterwards then
23

24
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,320
it will get logged down here in our console.
24

25
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:11,080
So this is the first step towards achieving our dynamic website and feel free to mess around with it,
25

26
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:17,080
try out different parameter names, try out multiple parameters as you can see where they've got
26

27
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,420
this one which is a single parameter and this one which is another parameter
27

28
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,780
and you can actually tap into both just by using req.params. the name of your parameter in your 
28

29
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,590
URL.
29

30
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,450
So play around with that and once you're ready we'll head over to the next challenge.
