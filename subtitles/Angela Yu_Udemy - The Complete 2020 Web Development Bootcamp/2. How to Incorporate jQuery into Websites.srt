
1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:00,950
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,820
So I've spoken so much about how awesome it is. How can we get it and incorporate jQuery into our
2

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,110
web sites to start benefiting from all of its awesomeness?
3

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,340
Well if you head over to jquery.com, you can see that, just like Bootstrap, you can download all the
4

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,250
jQuery code files through their download page, or you can simply use a CDN.
5

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,120
Now previously we explained what CDNs, or Content Delivery Networks, were and how they work.
6

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,490
So if you're at all confused about this then take a look back at the Bootstrap module when we talked
7

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,020
about this in detail.
8

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,100
Now the most popular option across the web is to use Google's CDN.
9

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:46,540
And, as we mentioned before, the beauty of using a popular CDN is that if a user has been to another web
10

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:53,670
site that uses the same CDN to fetch the jQuery library, then they'll likely have it already cached
11

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,430
and saved in their browser, which means that when they want to load up your web site they won't have
12

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,880
to fetch a fresh copy of jQuery,
13

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,250
they've already got it loaded and ready to go,
14

15
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,550
giving your web site a much faster load rate. So we're going to be using the latest version of jQuery, 
15

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,600
3.3.1.
16

17
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,580
Now at the time when you're watching this video it might just be that it'll be 3.3.2 or a larger
17

18
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,120
number,
18

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,520
but I want you to get the latest version with the script tag,
19

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,080
and we're going to copy it and we're going to create a new project.
20

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,610
Now I want you to go into your Web Development project folder and create a new project, and we're going
21

22
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,890
to call this jQuery, and then we're going to drag and drop this into Atom, and then we're going to
22

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,320
hit a in order to create a new file,
23

24
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,920
and this is going to be index.html
24

25
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:50,080
as well as styles.css and also our index.js.
25

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:56,530
All right. So we've got all three files lined up and now let's head into our HTML, put in our boiler plate,
26

27
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,020
and we're simply going to call our web site title just jQuery.
27

28
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,510
We're going to hit save,
28

29
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:09,410
and now I want you to pause the video and incorporate our CSS as well as Javascript into this HTML web
29

30
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,250
page.
30

31
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,000
So pause the video now and see if you remember how and where to do that.
31

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,090
As we said before our style sheets should go into the head section of our web page.
32

33
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,510
So in here just below the title I'm going to create a link that has a relationship of stylesheet, and
33

34
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,290
the href is going to be styles.css.
34

35
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,920
Now let's hit save and let's just test this to make sure that it's definitely working.
35

36
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,560
So we're just going to change the background color of our body to red.
36

37
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,070
And now if I copy the full path of my index.html and paste it in here,
37

38
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:50,900
there we go.
38

39
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:57,970
All right. So our CSS is working and linked up, next step is to include and link up our Javascript.
39

40
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,020
Now if you completed the last module then you would know that,
40

41
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,900
preferably, you should include your Javascript at the end of your web site just before the closing tag
41

42
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,070
of the body.
42

43
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,720
So over here we're going to include a script with an external source and the source is going to be index.js.
43

44
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,040
I'm going to hit save.
44

45
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,020
And we're going to include some Javascript code in here just to check that it's working,
45

46
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,480
and if so we'll just send an alert that says "Working".
46

47
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,110
So now if I hit refresh and I get an alert as well as my background being red,
47

48
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:38,170
so I know that everything is all linked up and I can safely delete these bits of code.
48

49
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,850
Now in our index.html I'm going to include a number of HTML elements.
49

50
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,530
So first I'm going to have an h1 that just says Hello.
50

51
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,380
And then I'm going to have a whole bunch of buttons and the buttons are just going to say Click Me, but
51

52
00:03:53,410 --> 00:04:00,090
I'm going to copy this and paste it so that we have five buttons in total as well as an h1.
52

53
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:06,280
All right. So now let's hit save and I'm going to use the same code that I showed you in the last lesson
53

54
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,810
to write some jQuery
54

55
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,430
that's going to change the text color of each one to red.
55

56
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:20,350
So we're going to start off with the dollar sign which is short for jQuery, so you can either write
56

57
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,720
it like this or you can write it like this.
57

58
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,290
They both do exactly the same thing in jQuery. Almost everybody will be using the dollar sign, as a lot
58

59
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,720
of the reason why we're using jQuery is to shorten our code and do less typing.
59

60
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,150
OK. So I'm going to target the h1 in our document and I'm going to change its
60

61
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,680
CSS, namely the color property, to red.
61

62
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,020
All right. So now we've got our jQuery code.
62

63
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,720
We're going to be going through all of this code much much deeper later on.
63

64
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:57,700
But now all you need to know is that we're using this to select the h1 on our web page and we're changing
64

65
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,280
its
65

66
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,710
CSS, namely the color property, to red.
66

67
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,550
If I refresh my web site you'll see that nothing has happened because we need to incorporate jQuery
67

68
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:14,200
in order for this to be valid because right now if you open up the console you can see that it's telling
68

69
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,720
you that the dollar sign is not defined on Javascript line number two.
69

70
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,800
Now that's because the dollar sign, if you remember, is jQuery,
70

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,650
so if we don't have any jQuery then it's not really going to work.
71

72
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,430
So let's incorporate it.
72

73
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,740
Now head back to the Google Hosted Libraries page and copy the script tag,
73

74
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,720
and we're going to paste that above our Javascript script tag.
74

75
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:47,290
And now if you hit save and refresh then you can see that we have no more errors in our console and
75

76
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:54,650
the text is now being turned red using our jQuery code inside our index.js.
76

77
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:01,900
Now the position where you place your jQuery script tag is really important.
77

78
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:10,780
For example, if we placed it below our index.js, then you'll see that it no longer works,
78

79
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,430
and it no longer colors our text red, and we get the same problem that the dollar sign is not defined
79

80
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,370
in our index.js on line 2.
80

81
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:27,340
Now the reason is because if you remember the browser will read the code from top to bottom and the
81

82
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,820
first thing that it will try to process is are index.js.
82

83
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,290
So it heads over here,
83

84
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:40,490
and it tries to make sense and carry out the instructions in here, and when it sees that dollar sign at
84

85
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,300
this point it hasn't got a hold of the jQuery library yet,
85

86
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,940
so it still doesn't know what this dollar sign and all the short code is all about.
86

87
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:55,010
So that's why if you're going to use jQuery inside your Javascript code, then make sure that you
87

88
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:00,000
place the script tag above it so that by the time it gets into this file,
88

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,080
it already knows what the dollar sign is and how all of these shortening methods work.
89

90
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:12,680
Now the other way that it might mess up is that if you had both of the script tags inside the head section
90

91
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,760
of your web site, then when you refreshed your web site you'll notice that again it doesn't work.
91

92
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:25,370
And in this case it's not even giving you a proper error. And you have to be really careful about including
92

93
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:32,870
the CDN for our jQuery library in the head section of your web site, because what might happen is that
93

94
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:40,730
before we've actually finished loading up the entire jQuery library, our index.js might already be
94

95
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,990
trying to access it.
95

96
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:50,030
So one of the ways that you can safeguard against this is to check whether if our jQuery library is ready,
96

97
00:07:50,690 --> 00:08:00,800
and we do that by using the dollar sign to select our document and then we use the ready method and
97

98
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,820
we have a callback function in here.
98

99
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:10,290
And that means that once our document is ready then it's going to call this code.
99

100
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:17,980
So now if we hit save and we refresh then you can see our code now works because we waited until our
100

101
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:24,740
jQuery library has finished loading and then we access the h1 to change its color.
101

102
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,840
Now when you come across web sites, you'll often see this line of code.
102

103
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:37,450
But another way of doing exactly the same thing is simply to include all scripts at the end of our web
103

104
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,120
site right before the closing body tag.
104

105
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,510
And this is exactly the same thing as this line of code.
105

106
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:52,460
So when you see me writing jQuery code in the coming lessons, then you'll notice that I don't use
106

107
00:08:52,460 --> 00:09:00,110
that ready method because I always have my jQuery script at the end of my web site, and that way I only
107

108
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:07,070
try to tap into and manipulate my HTML element after they've been loaded up and rendered on screen.
