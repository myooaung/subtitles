00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.740
Now, the last thing that I want to show you that you can do with strings is, you can use a method called
1

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.260
toUpperCase()
2

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.890
that changes all of the characters in your string to uppercase.
3

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.100
So as we have done before, we simply take the variable, and then we write a dot, and then we use toUpperCase
4

5
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.070
to turn every single character in the string to the uppercase version of it.
5

6
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.750
So let me show you what this looks like in real life.
6

7
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.670
So I have a variable that is called name and it contains the string Angela.
7

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.990
Now, if I write name.toUppercase, and then I add some empty parentheses, and finish off my statement
8

9
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.870
with a semi-colon,
9

10
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.760
and now if I hit command enter, you can see that in the console I get the string that's contained a name
10

11
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.980
printed out with every single character changed to the upper case.
11

12
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.200
Now at the moment this functionality is completed and then this data is lost.
12

13
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.410
So inside here, for example if I just wrote name, which is my variable, you can see that it's still lowercase.
13

14
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.960
So if you wanted this to be saved to this variable then all we need to do is say that name equals the
14

15
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.250
old version of name, which is this, changed to uppercase, and then reassigned to the same variable.
15

16
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.730
So now if I hit run and I type name into the console to try and pull up the value that’s contained inside
16

17
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.420
this variable, you can see it is now all capitalized.
17

18
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.070
Now we can change it in the other direction as well.
18

19
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.630
So, for example, if I wrote name now equals the previous version of name, which at this point is all
19

20
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.200
uppercase, .toLowerCase, then
20

21
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.780
now, the final version of name is actually all fully lowercase,
21

22
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.250
even the first a. It’s all been turned into lowercase.
22

23
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.630
Now that's pretty easy and it's pretty useful as well because sometimes you might want to ask the user
23

24
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.220
for, say, a prompt and you ask them for ‘What is your name?’.
24

25
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.380
And they end up giving you their name in, say, all lowercase, right?
25

26
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.500
And that doesn't really look very good when you print it out, say in an alert.
26

27
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.030
It doesn't look that great and it won't be consistent across different users.
27

28
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.150
Now if you've been watching along with the previous lessons and you've absorbed the knowledge then you
28

29
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:37.280
should now be able to use everything that you've learnt including how to slice strings up, how to concatenate
29

30
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.430
strings, and also how to change the casing in order to complete the next challenge.
30

31
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.350
So what I want you to do is to create a prompt that asks the user for their name,
31

32
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:57.170
but if they give you a name that is uppercase or lowercase, I want you to be able to send them an alert
32

33
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.860
that says Hello,
33

34
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.680
and then their name, so for example Angela, but the name has to be capitalized, but only for the first
34

35
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.930
character and none of the rest of the characters.
35

36
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.210
So I want you to think about this problem,
36

37
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.570
and break it down into smaller chunks that you can tackle one at a time.
37

38
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.680
Now, while there are much easier ways of doing it if you search Stack Overflow or Google, I want you
38

39
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.480
to only use the things that we've talked about in this module.
39

40
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.810
So everything that you need to complete this challenge is within the lessons of this module.
40

41
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.710
So pause the video now and see if you can complete this challenge.
