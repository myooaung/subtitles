00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.690
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.060
So here's the answer to the challenge.
2

3
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.480
Now if you had any trouble trying to figure out how to create an object in Javascript then you would've
3

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.490
come across the syntax for an object that looks something like this.
4

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.180
So you would start with the keyword var to show that you're creating a new variable, then you would give
5

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.270
that variable a name whatever it is that you wish,
6

7
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.780
then you have an equal sign and you open a set of curly braces.
7

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:33.050
Now inside the curly braces you have your key value pairs and you can have as many pairs as you wish
8

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.540
and you can even nest key value pairs as the value for a particular key.
9

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.770
So in this case the key and values that are in red is actually bunched together as a value for the second
10

11
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.360
key.
11

12
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:55.320
So with this refresher on Javascript objects in mind let's head over to our app.js and let's delete
12

13
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.970
this console that log. And instead of console logging our post body and post title we're going to store
13

14
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.390
it inside a object.
14

15
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.950
Let's use the same syntax as we saw previously in the slides.
15

16
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.000
So that's create a var and we'll call it a post and we're going to use the equal sign and then we to open
16

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640
up a set of curly braces.
17

18
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.090
And this is the start of any Javascript object. Inside the curly braces
18

19
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.810
I'm going to put in my key value pairs.
19

20
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.210
So the two keys that I want are the title and the content.
20

21
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.570
Now all I have to do is just to add the values of each of those keys. So we know that the content is
21

22
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.630
basically this
22

23
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.370
right?
23

24
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.750
It's request.
24

25
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.700
body.postBody.
25

26
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:51.800
And- So the title is structured very similarly request.body.postTitle and then we have a comma
26

27
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.850
separating our key value pairs and we complete object by closing it off with a semicolon.
27

28
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.470
So now we can delete our console.log and we now have our brand new object that's called post that contains
28

29
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.400
two key value pairs separated by a comma,
29

30
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.380
one is going to be the title and one is going to be the content. And these values are passed over
30

31
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.820
when that post route is triggered.
31

32
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.390
Now the final thing to consider is that we mentioned previously that you should try to avoid using vars
32

33
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.940
if at all possible.
33

34
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.120
And the best type of programming practice is to start with the most restrictive type of variable which
34

35
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.490
is a const.
35

36
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.370
And as you remember consts cannot be changed after they've been created. And we're not planning on
36

37
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.280
changing it inside here after it's been declared. We're only interested in storing it and then we'll
37

38
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.350
use it inside one of our pages.
38

39
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.880
So a const is probably the best keyword to put over here. Now if you use the var or if you use the let,
39

40
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.430
that's completely fine. But just take a refresher of what we talked about in the scope lesson and
40

41
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.230
when we mentioned these three types of variables.
41

42
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.720
So now we're ready to move on to the next challenge.
