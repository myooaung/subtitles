00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,260
All right.
1

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:09,270
So here's the starting file for the React components practice. And the aim of the game is to separate
2

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,130
out all of this code into a separate component. By the end
3

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,850
you should have a single component which is called App inside your index
4

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:33,160
.js. And then you should have two separate JSX files, a App.jsx and a heading.js
5

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,330
x. And you should be able to use what you learnt from the previous lessons to separate out a lot of this
6

7
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,870
logic into different components.
7

8
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,300
Pause the video, fork the sandbox and see how you get on.
8

9
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:53,870
All right.
9

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:01,880
So here I've got the original code and we're rendering a single h1 element which is the heading which
10

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:09,210
is showing up right here. And what we want to do is we want to clear out all of the code from our index.
11

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,550
js so that it's only rendering a App component.
12

13
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:23,360
So let's go ahead and cut this h1 element and move it over to our heading.jsx. And also
13

14
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,330
the code that's required to render the heading,
14

15
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,760
so all of this logic we're going to cut it out of our index.
15

16
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,650
jsx and move it over here as well.
16

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,240
Now remember we need our React module in order to render JSX. So let's go ahead and import React
17

18
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,550
from "react".
18

19
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:50,460
And now we're going to create a function that is going to be called heading.
19

20
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,840
And this function is going to enclose all of this code.
20

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,360
So I'm going to cut this part out and then move it to the bottom here.
21

22
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:05,390
The final thing we need to do is we need to give our function an output, so tell it what it needs to
22

23
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,080
return
23

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,040
and it's of course going to be this h1 with class name of heading with style that's dynamically
24

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,030
determined by a code above and the greeting is also determined by the time of day using our Javascript
25

26
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:29,040
code inside this adding component. The final thing we need to do with our heading component is to export
26

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:39,530
this heading function. So let's go ahead and export default heading and now we can save it and use it
27

28
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,460
inside our App.js. So our App.
28

29
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:49,240
js is going to be the starting point of our component tree.
29

30
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:56,060
So it's going to import from React and then it's simply going to have a function called App and we're
30

31
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,510
just going to return one component in this case.
31

32
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,990
So normally you would probably have a div with multiple components.
32

33
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,890
In our case we could have the div or we could simply leave it out because all we want to return is just
33

34
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,590
that custom heading component which of course comes from the heading.jsx file which we'll need
34

35
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,650
to import if we actually want to use it.
35

36
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:29,230
Finally we're going to export our app as the default export from this file and then we're going to go
36

37
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:36,640
back over into our index.js and we're going to try and use that app element inside the ReactDOM render
37

38
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,220
method.
38

39
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,110
So let's go ahead to
39

40
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,660
import App from ./App.
40

41
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,650
And remember what I said in the last lesson that normally you would have a directory called components
41

42
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,430
to store all of these JSX components
42

43
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:03,260
and in that case then instead of ./App, it would be ./components/App and we get
43

44
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:09,200
back exactly the same website that we had in the beginning, but now we've got a starting point for our
44

45
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,060
app which is the App.jsx component and then inside that App.jsx
45

46
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:21,040
we've got a child component which is the heading that is worked out from the custom code right here.
46

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,410
So did you manage to get it right?
47

48
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,820
If not be sure to have a review of the last lesson.
48

49
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:34,280
But in the next lesson, we're going to do a deep dive on this import and export keyword that we've been
49

50
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,770
seeing a lot in the last few lessons.
50

51
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,470
And this is something that comes from ES6.
51

52
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:47,180
If you're interested in learning more about how imports and exports and how modules work in ES6, then
52

53
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,800
head over to the next lesson.
53

54
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,000
But if you're already really familiar with this and you've already used it and you're comfortable with
54

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,550
it, then feel free to skip the next lesson and continue in the curriculum.
55

56
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,480
So whichever way you choose,
56

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,040
I'll see you on the next lesson.
