00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,080
All right.
1

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:09,660
So once you have downloaded and extracted these starting files then you should have a folder structure
2

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,340
that looks like this.
3

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,520
And this will include all of the starting files.
4

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,650
So let us first take a look at it.
5

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,000
So we're going to be using EJS to template and layout our website.
6

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,280
So we've got a header and a footer. And in the header all you have are just some style sheets.
7

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,880
We're going to be using font awesome
8

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,820
and we're going to be using Bootstrap. And then I've got a link towards the custom style sheet which
9

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,960
is over there and all it does is it sets the body and set certain things centred and also gives the
10

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,390
secret text a little bit of formatting.
11

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,650
Now on our home page we've got a jumbotron so that comes from Bootstrap.
12

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:00,870
If you've got it, take a look at the documentation and it's centred using our custom CSS over here. Inside
13

14
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:10,950
the jumbotron I've got a icon of a key and an h1 and a paragraph. And then there are two buttons down
14

15
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,850
here: one that says register and one that says login and these buttons each hit up their respective
15

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,660
routes which we will set up in our app.js. very shortly.
16

17
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:31,320
Now on the login page it's laid out using Bootstrap so our logging form takes up a third of the width
17

18
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,540
of the website
18

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,070
and this uses Bootstrap grids and we covered that in detail in the Bootstrap section
19

20
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,260
so I'm just gonna go ahead and show you the most important part of this page which is our form over
20

21
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,510
here.
21

22
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:51,900
And this form makes a post request to our login route and it sends over a username which is going
22

23
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,610
to be the user's email and also a password which is gonna be set by the user.
23

24
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,440
And finally there's a submit button which is going to read log in and that's going to send the post
24

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,520
request to our login route and it's going to be caught in our server.
25

26
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,500
Now on our register site it's pretty much identical
26

27
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,380
other than the fact that this keeps up the register route making the POST request and the button says
27

28
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,640
register.
28

29
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,800
So it's a very very simple registration form.
29

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:33,270
And then once they have registered or logged in successfully they're able to finally access this secret
30

31
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:40,350
page. And this page is going to be the one that requires authentication to access and we're going to
31

32
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,960
make sure that there's no way of accessing it unless the user is logged in.
32

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,330
And finally there's a Submit page which we're going to look at a little bit later on when we want our
33

34
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:59,550
users to start submitting their own secrets. And this form is going to send a POST request to the submit
34

35
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:05,100
route and it's going to send over the secret that the user types into the text field
35

36
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,560
and this is all that there is.
36

37
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:14,250
Now finally if you take a look inside our app.js you can see that we've just got the very basic
37

38
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:23,670
modules that we always use express, body-parser and ejs. And we're adding our public folder as a static
38

39
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,510
resource,
39

40
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,990
we're setting our view engine to be ejs
40

41
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,560
and we've also set up body-parser.
41

42
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:35,510
And at the very bottom we've just got some code to start our server on port 3000.
42

43
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,670
So this should be intimately familiar to you by now.
43

44
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,220
But if not, make sure you have a look back at the beginning of the Node module where we covered this
44

45
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,630
in detail.
45

46
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:52,800
Now in our code we're requiring all of these packages. But you'll notice that in your project folder
46

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,680
we don't yet have a packages.json
47

48
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,580
and that is because we haven't installed these packages. Now we're going to open up our hyper terminal
48

49
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,070
and you're going to cd over to wherever your project folder is.
49

50
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,870
So in my case the project files for the secrets project is on my desktop
50

51
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,770
so I'm going to cd into them.
51

52
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,540
Yours might be in download or wherever it may be.
52

53
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,980
Once we're there, we're going to run npm init and I'm going to set the y flag to answer yes to everything
53

54
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,730
as usual and then I'm going to install some packages. And the packages that we pretty much always need
54

55
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:35,260
are express and ejs and body-parser.
55

56
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,310
So let's go ahead and install all three of those packages.
56

57
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:48,690
So once it's completed doing that then we should now have our package.json updated with our three dependencies:
57

58
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,660
body-parser, ejs and express.
58

59
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,990
So we're ready to go and build out our server
59

60
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,670
now. First things first, we want to be able to view some of these websites. So we're going to have
60

61
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,470
to add some app.get in here.
61

62
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:13,270
So I'm going to target the home route or the root route and here I'm going to render my home page. So
62

63
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:20,010
I'm going to just use res.render and we're going to render the page that is called home.ejs.
63

64
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,580
And then we're going to do the same
64

65
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,980
and I'm just gonna copy and paste it
65

66
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:33,190
so you doing it bored watching this. And we're going to change it to the login route, the register route
66

67
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,940
and we're gonna change the render to the login page and the register page and that's it.
67

68
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:49,230
So now let's go ahead and just double check our code that we don't have any forward slashes in the res.
68

69
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:57,640
renders and we saved our file and we can go ahead and start nodemon app.js and you can see our service
69

70
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,250
start on port 3000.
70

71
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:08,620
So let's go ahead and check it out. So here is our home page rendered and you can see that's where our
71

72
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,790
little font awesome icon comes from,
72

73
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:19,290
h1, our little title there and we've got our register and login buttons.
73

74
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,990
So if I click on register, it should take me to /register.
74

75
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:30,380
And that's because that button makes a GET request to that route which we target in here
75

76
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:37,230
and it renders the register page which looks something like this. Very simple, just two fields, email and
76

77
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:46,470
password set up very simply using Bootstrap cards and Bootstrap forms. And if we go back and click on
77

78
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,710
login then it takes us to the login page which looks pretty much identical.
78

79
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,860
So now our website is pretty much set up and ready for us to start adding some authentication to it
79

80
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:06,840
so that we can see if a user is registered or logged in before we allow them to view the secrets page.
80

81
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,840
So in the next lesson
81

82
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,550
that's exactly what we're gonna be doing.
82

83
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,820
We're gonna be creating our user's account on a MongoDB database and we're going to be authenticating
83

84
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,320
them using our level 1 security authentication.
84

85
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,740
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
