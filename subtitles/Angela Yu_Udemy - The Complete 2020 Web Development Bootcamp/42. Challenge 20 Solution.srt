00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:00,680
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,740
So here's the answer to this challenge.
2

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:09,020
Now in order to solve this challenge you have to remember that programmers don't memorize things.
3

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,120
Instead we always search for what it is that we need and the skill is being able to apply it to your
4

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,580
current problem.
5

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,390
Good old Google.
6

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,950
I'm going to start off by searching inside Google for what it is that I want and it tends to be verb
7

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,300
object and the programming language that I use.
8

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,510
So in this case I want to truncate a string using Javascript.
9

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,680
This is a good format to use whenever you're trying to solve problems.
10

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,290
Don't have anything that's really specific in here.
11

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:45,150
Say if I just said truncate string to 100 characters, then I would limit my search to only the people
12

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,930
who explained how to truncate a string to 100 characters right?
13

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,360
Somebody might have wanted to do it for 20 characters or 5 characters. So don't have anything specific
14

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,360
in there, just have a verb, an object
15

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,350
and the programming language and that tends to work pretty well.
16

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,050
So let's explore the first answer.
17

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:10,440
And it seems like this person also just want to truncate something using pure Javascript down to a set
18

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,930
number of characters.
19

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:18,030
Now the first answer explains to you that you can use the substring method and they very kindly link to
20

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,360
the documentation. And you can see that here if you have a variable that say hello world which is a string
21

22
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,390
then you can use the substring method on that string in order to cut it down.
22

23
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:37,650
So in this case if we're saying that we want to cut it down from 1 to 4, then remember that programming
23

24
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,260
starts from 0
24

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,760
so we would take the first character of our Hello world
25

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,930
so at this position, and then we would end up the fourth character.
26

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,230
So if I now hit Try it you can see that I just get ell . And if I change this to say 0 and 3 then
27

28
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,880
I will start from the beginning and I'll only take the first three characters.
28

29
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,880
So now if I hit run and hit Try it, then I only get Hel.
29

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,820
So let's apply this substring method to our code to make it do what we want.
30

31
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,360
The part that we want to truncate is our post.content and we want to do it inside our home.ejs
31

32
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,300
where we got access to each and every post's content. Right at the end here
32

33
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:31,290
I'm going to tag on that method substring and then I need to specify a from and a to.
33

34
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,080
So the from is going to be from the very beginning,
34

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,100
so the zeroth character and the end is going to be at the 100th character,
35

36
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:47,610
so 0 - 100. And then at the end of all of this string, I'm going to append or add onto it space and then
36

37
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,460
...
37

38
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,530
And this should indicate to the reader that this is truncated
38

39
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,430
and if they wanted to read more than they have to click on something.
39

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,550
So let's hit save. And we head back to our home page and we hit refresh
40

41
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,740
then you should see that all of our blog posts are now truncated down to only 100 characters and we
41

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:14,710
just have that ... at the end to show that there's actually more. To complete this entire module
42

43
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,010
there is only one more challenge.
43

44
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,110
So I'll see over there.
