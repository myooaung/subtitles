00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.430
All right here comes the answer for challenge 5.
1

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.200
Now as I mentioned, the first thing to address is our contact.ejs page and our about.ejs page.
2

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.430
We essentially want to replicate what we did in our home.
3

4
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.300
ejs. And for time's sake
4

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.230
I'm just going to copy and paste what we had in our home.ejs into these two pages.
5

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.350
Now in our contact.ejs we want to include the head partial and the footer partial but instead of
6

7
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.920
having an h1 that says home, it should now say contact. And instead of passing in the starting content
7

8
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.820
we're going to pass over the contact content as the name of the variable.
8

9
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.790
And I'm going to do the same inside about page.
9

10
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.490
So I'm going to change the h1 to about and the content to about content.
10

11
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.410
So now let's hit save on both of those pages and we're ready to go into our app.js to define the
11

12
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.370
routes.
12

13
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.090
So we're going to again use app.get because the user is trying to get these web pages. And the first
13

14
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.320
route we're going to target is /about and then we're going to add our callback function our req
14

15
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.260
and res.
15

16
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.890
And inside this function we're going to again res.render.
16

17
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.180
But this time instead of rendering the home page we're going to render the about page. And then we're
17

18
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.060
going to pass over a Javascript object that has to be named about content.
18

19
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.860
So I'm just going to copy this over here and use it as the key inside this Javascript object.
19

20
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.060
And I'm going to add my colon and I'm going to pass in the variable that I want to have inside my About
20

21
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.320
page which is this thing about content.
21

22
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.480
So I'm going to go ahead and add that there and then we'll close everything off with some semicolons
22

23
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.980
and that should now get us are about page.
23

24
00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:01.130
Now notice how over here passing in this object I try to make it clear by saying that the variable name
24

25
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.700
that's going to be passed over is called starting content and that is what we'll have access to
25

26
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.820
now inside home.ejs once that gets passed over. And the data I'm passing over is called home starting
26

27
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.650
content which comes over here.
27

28
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.130
So that value is what's going to be passed over.
28

29
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.980
Now inside this route, I'm keeping more in line with the Node and Express standard formatting which is
29

30
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.530
where they use the same name for the key and the value.
30

31
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.880
Now if you find this confusing
31

32
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.850
feel free to do it exactly the same way that I've done it here just to make it clear what's the value,
32

33
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.170
where's it from,
33

34
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.560
and what's the key and what's being passed over.
34

35
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.530
And depending on your comfort level, name your variables whichever way you wish.
35

36
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.060
Now all we have to do is just add our last path which is an app.get method for the /contact
36

37
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.920
page.
37

38
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:06.940
And then here's our anonymous callback function. And we're going to res.render our contact page
38

39
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.660
and we're going to pass over our contact content.
39

40
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.950
And the value of that is going to be from this current page with a variable called contact content.
40

41
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:29.620
And let's again close off with semicolons and now we should be able to test our code and refresh our
41

42
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.550
page.
42

43
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.700
And now if we go to /contact we can see that we're getting this data here which of course
43

44
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.710
comes from this variable.
44

45
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:45.880
So that means we've successfully passed over contact content over to our contact.ejs and we're including it
45

46
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.850
inside a paragraph type.
46

47
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:56.530
And if we head over to /about then we get the about content that we had over at the top of
47

48
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.800
our app.js.
48

49
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.490
So that was just a refresher on how we create our routes and how we pass data around using EJS.
49

50
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.690
And we did this plenty of times in the EJS module.
50

51
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.120
So if you're at all confused, be sure to take a look back at those videos.
51

52
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.270
But once you're ready it's time for the next challenge.
