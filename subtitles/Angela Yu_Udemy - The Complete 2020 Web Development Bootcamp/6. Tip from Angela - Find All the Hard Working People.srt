Hey.
1

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,020
Well done on
2

3
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,690
completing yet another module.
3

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:12,370
Now I want to talk to you about something that I find helps me with motivation.
4

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:19,050
Now I know that as computer programmers we have this kind of reputation for not really wanting to interact
5

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,100
with other humans but you know that doesn't have to be true right?
6

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,840
And we can in fact interact with other humans.
7

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,170
Let's say you're in a library where like everybody is doing their own thing and you don't have to talk to
8

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,620
anybody.
9

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:37,860
But the point I'm saying is that when you're working at home and you're all alone and you're trying
10

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,490
to study through this thing it can get really hard.
11

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,870
But if you're in a place where everybody else is working and you look up and you look at the intenseness
12

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,480
to which everybody's working, it makes you want to work hard as well.
13

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:59,610
So I find even though I've graduated from my university many years ago now, I have an alumni card which
14

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:06,450
means I can still go back to the university library and I do that whenever I have to do something that
15

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,070
I procrastinate a lot on.
16

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,910
So if I have to do something difficult and when I'm at home I just keep passing it over
17

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,780
when I'm at work
18

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,490
I just can't really do it,
19

20
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,360
I go to the university library and this is really really helpful.
20

21
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,020
It's just like the exam time when everybody's studying really hard.
21

22
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,550
It's like you know you feel inspired to work hard because you're kind of twiddling your thumbs while
22

23
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,060
everybody else is studying really hard you feel kind of silly
23

24
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,330
right?
24

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:44,340
So see if you can find these opportunities where either you have a study buddy or if you have a local
25

26
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,900
library that you can access where everybody's quiet and then working hard.
26

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:55,680
See if you can try to use that to increase your own level of motivation and see if that helps you get
27

28
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,000
further.
28

29
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,650
But the key thing is keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going.
