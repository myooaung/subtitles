00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:07.410
Now that we've learned about some of the principles of web design such as Color Theory, Typography, User
1

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.730
Interface design and User Experience design, the four pillars, it's time to apply what we've learned and
2

3
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.040
build a design together.
3

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.220
Now there's a website called Daily UI which gives you a task to design every day for 100 days.
4

5
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.610
It's free to sign up and it's something that really does improve designing skills by just that repeated
5

6
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.060
practice.
6

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.070
Now if you take a look at a website called Collect UI you can see they've collected together all the
7

8
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.290
designers attempts at designing each of these daily challenges and you can see examples what each of
8

9
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.800
these challenges are.
9

10
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.810
For example, anything from creating a sign up screen to a flight website to a hotel booking website.
10

11
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.630
So we're going to take some of these ideas as inspiration and create our own website design
11

12
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.190
applying the four pillars that we've learned in this module. The first thing I want you to do is head
12

13
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.980
over to a website called canva.com.
13

14
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.430
Now this is a online graphics editing program and you don't have to download anything and it's completely
14

15
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.660
free to sign up.
15

16
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.580
So sign up for a new account and then go ahead and create a new design.
16

17
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.720
So we're going to pick custom dimensions and I'm going to choose 1400 pixels by 800 pixels high.
17

18
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.750
Once we're inside our design we're going to take this as the first screen that the user sees in our
18

19
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.740
website.
19

20
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.270
And then when they scroll down they'll see the next page and then they scroll down and see the final
20

21
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.350
part of our website.
21

22
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.060
So let's design the first title screen.
22

23
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.780
Now I'm going to choose this free template which gives me a backdrop already but I'm actually just going
23

24
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.380
to use it for some texture. I quite like the way that this pattern looks.
24

25
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.030
So I'm going to apply the pattern and then I'm going to change the background.
25

26
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.080
Now I think the background looks a little bit bland with just a single color.
26

27
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.600
So I'm going to choose a photo instead and I'm going to search for a beach, like this one.
27

28
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.960
So now that I've got my image I'm going to drag it out so that it's sized as large as it needs to be.
28

29
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.200
So going all the way to each of the edges. And then I'm going to reposition it so that it fills up the
29

30
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.200
entire screen. Like this.
30

31
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.500
So now I have a background image, some sort of texture on it
31

32
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.810
and I can go to the elements to keep adding to this design.
32

33
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.920
Let's take a look at some of the gradients here.
33

34
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.930
And I'm going to pick something that'll fit in with this theme.
34

35
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.590
Now, of course, how you design this is completely up to you.
35

36
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.710
And I'm just providing an example of how I go through this process of designing.
36

37
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.510
So now I've got a circle here.
37

38
00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.670
I'm going to add some more shapes maybe a square of some sort. We can click on see all to see all the
38

39
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.870
other ones.
39

40
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:12.270
And then I'm going to put a square which I'm going to make it so that it goes right to the end of each
40

41
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.340
of the sites.
41

42
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.310
So here and then we're going to make it line up with the center of the circle roughly like this.
42

43
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.460
And let's just change that color to white.
43

44
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.080
Now we have this nice white border, some abstract shapes and patterns and an image.
44

45
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.530
Now I'm going to add a heading text. This heading text is going to be the name of our hotel.
45

46
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.140
After all we're designing a website for this unknown Hotel which I'll call "A Hotel".
46

47
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:49.410
A really easy way of making something look authoritative and like it's been around forever is by changing
47

48
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.170
the typeface to a Serif typeface.
48

49
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.470
So I'm going to highlight this font and I'm going to click the dropdown and find a serif typeface like
49

50
00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.790
this one cardo.
50

51
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.870
And notice how instantly our hotel looks a lot more established like it's been around for longer.
51

52
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.530
Now I'm going to change the color of this also to white.
52

53
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.710
So notice how we're starting to establish a color palette of greens and turquoise and blue and white.
53

54
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:26.870
And we're going to increase the font size to maybe something really large like 120 or 144. And
54

55
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.070
I'm going to change this so that it's all caps like so.
55

56
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.050
So that's actually a little bit too big
56

57
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:41.360
so let's drop it down a notch. And I can increase the spacing of the letters to again make it look more
57

58
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.450
fancy, more expensive and more authoritative.
58

59
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.710
Here's the name of our hotel, A Hotel,  centered in this box.
59

60
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.400
And now I'm ready to add a subheading and my subheading is going to be some sort of tagline
60

61
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.560
right?
61

62
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.020
And I'm going to go with something really obnoxious like "Lose Yourself to find yourself".
62

63
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.070
I feel like I'm ready to open a hotel tomorrow.
63

64
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:17.170
Let's Now contrast this serif typeface for the title with a San-Serif sort of body or subtitle.
64

65
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.010
And this is what we learned about in the typography section.
65

66
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.260
It creates contrast in the design.
66

67
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.820
So I'm going to pick this Glacial indifference typeface and I'm again going to choose white and then
67

68
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.590
make both these lines left-aligned so that I can align them to the same position.
68

69
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.700
And that is how when you drag elements around on canvas it automatically gives you these alignment grids
69

70
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.670
so that you can more easily position it so that they are actually all aligned together.
70

71
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.710
And notice how big a difference that looks
71

72
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.190
just having it off alignment and then on alignment. It's suddenly just looks a lot more proper
72

73
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.170
right? Now I'm more or less done with my title page.
73

74
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.830
I'm going to move on to the next one which is going to be a page for selling the features of the hotel.
74

75
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:11.330
Let's start off by adding some images. And I've got some that I've already found before.
75

76
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:18.290
I've got a picture of a bedroom which I'm going to make it a little bit smaller like so and then I've
76

77
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.950
got a picture of a breakfast of some sort.
77

78
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.290
So you've got food at this hotel.
78

79
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.460
You're not going to starve.
79

80
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.770
That's pretty important for people to know.
80

81
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.510
And I'm going to size it so that it's actually the same size as the other one.
81

82
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.930
So I'm just going to put it on top.
82

83
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.000
Now the last one is going to be a pool.
83

84
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.610
So you've also got a pool.
84

85
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.830
You don't get bored if it gets too hot.
85

86
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.650
You can always just go into the pool.
86

87
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.780
This is turning out to be a great hotel
87

88
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.690
by the way, I really want to stay here.
88

89
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.600
Now the goal of our features page is to have three images which are probably going to be about the same
89

90
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.470
size.
90

91
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.920
So I'm actually going to need to crop this last photo so that I get rid of maybe a little bit of this
91

92
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:05.520
right edge but have it just about the same size as my other photos.
92

93
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.780
And now I need to resize each of these photos so that it actually can fit onto this page.
93

94
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.850
So I'm just going to throw them one on top of the other and resize them
94

95
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.670
so they're all the same size.
95

96
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.210
And now I can place them around this web page.
96

97
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.730
So when you move towards the edge of each page you can see this grid show up.
97

98
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.500
So I'm going to line up the left with the left side of the grid the right with the right side of the
98

99
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.410
grid and the middle right in the middle.
99

100
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:39.160
So now these three are evenly spaced apart and I can now add some more design features to it because
100

101
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.430
it's looking a little bit bland just as photos.
101

102
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:48.180
Now one of the easiest things to make photos look nice is to just jazz it up with a frame.
102

103
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.440
Now because all hotel is very modern, it's contemporary,
103

104
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.210
it's been featured in Vogue,
104

105
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.820
I want to make sure that the framing also looks equally contemporary.
105

106
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:04.780
So I'm going to find a circle and I'm going to put this circle around this square image which is going
106

107
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:11.590
to make it look quite nice and contemporary. And then I'm going to give it a background color like that.
107

108
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.520
And we've now framed our picture.
108

109
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:22.150
So now, all I have to do is just copy it and put it onto all the other images like so.
109

110
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.490
And now I've got three features.
110

111
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.830
You've got a bed, you've got food, you've got pool.
111

112
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.650
What more do you want? The next part is probably going to be some sort of explainer
112

113
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.210
right?
113

114
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:39.790
So add a subheading of these sections and the subheading is going to be something like you get beautiful
114

115
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:45.160
food, you have beautiful rooms and you have a beautiful pool.
115

116
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.070
So three things that we've got. And I'm going to left-align
116

117
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:59.500
each of these again so that I can make it aligned with the left edge of each of the pictures like this.
117

118
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:07.240
So all three of these pieces of text are on the same horizontal level and they're also vertically aligned
118

119
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.360
with the start of each image.
119

120
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.240
Now each of these will need to be designed so that they have the same typeface as what we had in the
120

121
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.370
title page so that it's consistent
121

122
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:18.950
right?
122

123
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.670
We're reflecting the same thing that we saw before.
123

124
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:29.890
So I'm gonna change that again to Glacial indifference and do the same for all three bits of text.
124

125
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:36.370
And now we can afford to increase the spacing in the text a little bit to make it look a little bit
125

126
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:41.270
more roomy. So I think I had 18
126

127
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:46.940
on the other one so I'm going to put 18 here as well and 18 here as well.
127

128
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.350
There we go.
128

129
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:55.760
So we've got all three bits of text and now all we need is just a little bit of body text. For the bod
129

130
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.200
text
130

131
00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:04.460
I'm going to use a Lorem Ipsum. So I'm going to use one of these generators and just get some text generated
131

132
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:12.200
and I'm going to copy a little bit of it and put it into my design. Replace that text with this
132

133
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.420
and that's a little bit too much.
133

134
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:22.280
So let's make it a bit smaller. And we're going to have some text which is going to go just below this
134

135
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.540
section.
135

136
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.850
So it's still a little bit too much.
136

137
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.730
Let's get rid of the last sentence. That looks pretty good.
137

138
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.340
Now again we want to keep our design consistent.
138

139
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:37.190
So we're going to make sure it's again left aligned using the same font as before.
139

140
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:44.360
And we've now got a bit of body text which I'm going to further style by changing the color of each
140

141
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.310
of these.
141

142
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:53.700
So I want to go for maybe like a dark-grayish like one of these and the same for the body text.
142

143
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.750
That way it doesn't sort of stand out so much.
143

144
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.350
And I'm going to copy this
144

145
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:03.620
so that I put it on all of the other features.
145

146
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.410
Notice the alignment here.
146

147
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.390
I've got all the pictures aligned with each other,
147

148
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.570
all of these circles center-aligned with each picture,
148

149
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:17.610
I've got all the text lined along the left and this just makes the design look a lot tighter
149

150
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.910
and a lot more consistent.
150

151
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:25.330
And notice how with the layout I've tried to keep it interesting by having some pictures that break
151

152
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:31.130
up the text and making sure that each body of text is not overwhelming. It's not too long
152

153
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.570
like a big long sentence.
153

154
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.440
But instead it's short enough to be easily read quickly.
154

155
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.790
Now, the other thing you'll notice is that there's a degree of hierarchy that's being established here
155

156
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.450
right?
156

157
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:46.630
Clearly the thing that I really want people to know is that my hotel is called A Hotel.
157

158
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.800
But in addition, I've also got beautiful food being more important than the body text
158

159
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.640
that explains that paragraph.
159

160
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:59.750
And each of these images also being more important because, let's face it, most people look at the pictures
160

161
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.100
and don't read anything right?
161

162
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.930
So that's our second part of the website
162

163
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:03.530
done.
163

164
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.270
And we're now onto the last part which is going to be the contact page.
164

165
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:15.080
So this contact page I'm again going to search for maybe a photo of something that's quite fashionable,
165

166
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.530
contemporary, tropical.
166

167
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:21.020
Maybe we can just find a picture of a pineapple.
167

168
00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.130
And this one looks pretty good.
168

169
00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:30.320
Let's go ahead and position this photo so that it's the same size as the design.
169

170
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.330
And now I can move it up so that only the bottom shows up my pineapples.
170

171
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.080
So there we go.
171

172
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:43.100
We've got 1, 2 and 3 and the last part is just a contact me page. The contact me page is also
172

173
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.280
going to need some titled text.
173

174
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.360
Let's just call that Stay.
174

175
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.940
So when they want to stay they can take a look at this section. And we're going to again copy this style
175

176
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.510
that we had from before so that we can actually replicate it down here
176

177
00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.830
and we keep our design again consistent.
177

178
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:06.800
It has the same theme, the same color palette, the same typography.
178

179
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:13.280
This is a little bit too big though. So let's make it a bit smaller so it fits onto this page.
179

180
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:19.100
And again I'm going to be consistent with our geometric shapes which is lending that sort of modern
180

181
00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.830
feel. I've got a sort of rectangle, a circle, more circles.
181

182
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:31.880
So let's pick another shape from here. Maybe some sort of a hexagon. That looks pretty good.
182

183
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.260
Let's add the hexagon,
183

184
00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:43.490
make it a bit smaller, we can maybe move our pineapples down a bit and change this so that it's white
184

185
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.930
and make it even a bit smaller.
185

186
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.000
I think something like that would do quite well.
186

187
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:57.380
So now the final thing I want to add is some sort of mailing address, email address, phone number, which
187

188
00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:02.200
is going to go in here and it's going to be nicely aligned with this word stay.
188

189
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:10.190
So let's go ahead and take this word and make it right aligned so that this line pops up when I try
189

190
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:16.810
to align it like so and let's just make sure that it actually still fits in.
190

191
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:23.450
So maybe we have to move this text up a little bit, reduce the spacing a little.
191

192
00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:29.210
I think a lot of times you do have to play around with your design just so that it starts looking good
192

193
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.040
to you.
193

194
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:35.240
You might have to shift things a little bit and be flexible with those rules that we've talked about.
194

195
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:43.610
So now all we need to make sure is that the word is right-aligned and our text is also right-aligned
195

196
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.240
so that we can actually line them up together so that they actually look like they're on the same vertical
196

197
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.830
alignment.
197

198
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:59.720
Now, if we can just mess around with the size of the hexagon and make sure that everything is still within
198

199
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:05.960
the hexagon and we've pretty much finished our design now. What did that take? Maybe 20 minutes. And
199

200
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.330
we managed to apply a lot of things that we've learned from User Interface design or User Experience
200

201
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:19.700
design, Color Theory and Typography to create this 3-page very modern looking website for A Hotel.
201

202
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:26.000
So at this point, there's a really cool feature in Canva which lets you just publish the website.
202

203
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:33.830
So if you click on this publish button and you scroll all the way down and you click on website then
203

204
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:40.820
you can actually select the Web style as standard and then open this as an actual web page.
204

205
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:46.100
Notice how it's placed my three pages together into an actual web page
205

206
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.390
and I can scroll down and also navigate to it through the navigation bar.
206

207
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.920
Now of course we don't have mobile optimization,
207

208
00:15:53.930 --> 00:16:01.130
we don't have any code that has any functionality, we can't add javascript to it. But at least we can quickly
208

209
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:06.440
throw up a design, visualize it and share it with other people to see what they think.
209

210
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:11.050
And this is probably one of the best ways of building up your design muscle.
210

211
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:17.510
Just practicing again and again until you get to a point where pretty much unanimously everybody thinks
211

212
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:22.520
that your design looks great and people start asking you to actually build websites for them.
212

213
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.940
So study a lot of the websites that you come across,
213

214
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:30.320
the ones that you think look really good. And think about what makes them good and then try to take some
214

215
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:37.700
of those aspects along with everything you've learned in these lessons to create designs that humans
215

216
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:38.840
love.
216

217
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:47.370
So I hope you'll take a moment now to pause the video and have a go at creating your own hotel website.
217

218
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:54.020
So use the same tools that you saw me use on Canva and try to design a slightly different type of hotel.
218

219
00:16:54.020 --> 00:17:00.500
What if it had to be a more traditional hotel that was around the time of Henry the 8th or something? It's
219

220
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:07.200
like some really old hotel and they want to show how decadent they are, how glamorous they are, and trying
220

221
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.090
to design a different type of website.
221

222
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:16.370
So pause the video, give that a go and then try to apply everything you've learned in this module into
222

223
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:17.580
that design.
223

224
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:24.140
And once you've created your design share this link that you can see at the top of Canva so that we
224

225
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.950
can all see your design and we can comment on how beautiful it looks.
225

226
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.670
So have a go at doing that and make sure that you let us know what it looks like in the comments below
226

227
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:39.990
and have fun doing it. Now I hope you really enjoyed this module on web design.
227

228
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.550
It's a little bit different from what you've been used to so far.
228

229
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:48.530
There's no coding in this module but instead we tried to get you to think about all of the design principles
229

230
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:54.380
that actually ends up creating beautiful websites, websites that people will love. And hopefully
230

231
00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:59.150
you'll take these pillars and this knowledge through the next time you build your product or you build
231

232
00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:06.110
your website and you'll apply it alongside with your code so that you have beautiful features and beautiful
232

233
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.450
interface.
233

234
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.440
Now once you've created your own designs and you've shared it with us then it's time to get back to
234

235
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.310
the coding and 
235

236
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:18.570
we're going to continue tackling more web development. So for all of that and more,
236

237
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.280
I'll see you there.
