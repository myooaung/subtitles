Hey guys.
1

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:09,820
So far our React websites have looked pretty ugly and it's because we haven't been able to add any CSS
2

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,250
styling.
3

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,920
We've been using these standard HTML elements that were rendering using React.
4

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,970
So in this lesson I want to talk about how to style your React elements and how you can use attributes
5

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,690
in JSX.
6

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:35,670
Go ahead and get hold of your own copy of this current code sandbox and then go ahead and fork it.
7

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,970
So if you remember from our lessons on CSS, let's say that we wanted to change this
8

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,300
h1's color to red,
9

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,450
then we might go into our styles.css and create a class style.
10

11
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,850
So let's just call it heading and then we change the color to red.
11

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,030
So pretty simple style.
12

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:08,460
Now if we head back into our index.js, if this was actually an HTML file then adding that class
13

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:15,320
to this h1 would be as easy as adding a class attribute and setting it to heading.
14

15
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,170
Now in this case it still works.
15

16
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:26,850
And when we apply this heading class style from over here into our h1, you can see that it does in fact
16

17
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,800
change the color to red.
17

18
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,230
But let's see what problems we get.
18

19
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:39,330
If I pop this out in a new window and we go ahead and hit COMMAND + OPTION +I to bring up all Chrome developer
19

20
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:46,920
tools and in the console here you'll see that you get a warning saying invalid DOM property class, did
20

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,680
you mean 'className'?
21

22
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:57,000
So remember that this, even though it looks like HTML, it's still being rendered down to JavaScript. And
22

23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:04,800
in JavaScript the property to access all of the classes that exist on an element is a property called
23

24
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,000
class name.
24

25
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:14,520
Now React has done some handling behind the scenes so that even if you did leave this as class, it
25

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,170
would still work.
26

27
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,240
But there are some hairy situations that you might get yourself into.
27

28
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,390
And the proper name of this attribute is class name. And you'll see that as soon as I change this to
28

29
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,540
class name and we go back and reload this site
29

30
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,090
now that warning goes away. While we here
30

31
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,910
if you're curious what this warning is about and why it's telling us that in our inde.js file
31

32
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,350
on line 1, it doesn't recognize this angle bracket.
32

33
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,850
Well the reason is because it doesn't know that this index.js file is in fact a JSX file
33

34
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,630
that includes HTML elements rather than just a bog standard normal JavaScript file.
34

35
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,370
So how can we tell it that this is a JSX file?
35

36
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:10,630
Well if we go into our index.html and the place where we're importing our script here,
36

37
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:19,320
normally when we add a JavaScript script we provide the source and we provide the type as a text file
37

38
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:25,680
with Javascript code. But in our case this is still a text file but it's now JSX code.
38

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,530
So we've got to change this to JSX and if we hit save we go back and reload our website.
39

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,080
You'll notice that warning is now gone because it knows that this is a JSX file that can includes
40

41
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,890
HTML-like code.
41

42
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:50,400
The other thing that some of you guys might have noticed is that when we add an attribute in normal
42

43
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:59,460
HTML, it's not camelcase like this where the first word is lowercase and the next words are capitalized
43

44
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,710
like the end for name here.
44

45
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,520
Instead it looks like this.
45

46
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,350
So here I've got a list of all the HTML global attributes.
46

47
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,470
So these attributes can be used on any HTML element.
47

48
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,950
And one of these is called contenteditable.
48

49
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,800
And notice how it's not camel cased, it's all one word.
49

50
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:27,900
But when we head back to our JSX file the convention that you should follow is to name it like as
50

51
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,360
if it's Javascript.
51

52
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:36,930
So if it's called contenteditable then we're going to call it contentEditable and you can see that
52

53
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:43,610
already the auto suggest from the JSX code completion is telling me to write it
53

54
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,850
camel case like so and let's set it to true.
54

55
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:57,930
Now if I hit save and go ahead and click on my h1 you can see that it's now a editable element. And if
55

56
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:06,570
we set it to false then this is not editable like a normal h1 should be.
56

57
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:13,770
So if I change this back to the HTML attributes style where everything is not camelcase and
57

58
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,820
I hit save,
58

59
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,540
you'll notice that it no longer works the same. Again
59

60
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:27,930
I lose my Javascript powers. So remember that whenever you're writing attributes in HTML  to make them
60

61
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,320
camel cased.
61

62
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:37,300
Anything that you know of from HTML attributes you have to change it to the camel case version.
62

63
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:44,070
So if I go ahead and make my h1 editable again by setting this to true and I start typing some mumbo
63

64
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:50,120
jumbo, you can see that normally if you're within Chrome you get your spellcheck activated.
64

65
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:57,270
Go ahead and pause the video and take a look at this list of global attributes to see if there's a way
65

66
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,820
for you to turn off the spellcheck so that we no longer get these red underline
66

67
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,420
happening here. Pause the video and try to complete this challenge.
67

68
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,630
All right.
68

69
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:16,880
So as you can see we have a attribute called spellcheck and we can specify whether if the element is to
69

70
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:24,710
have it's spelling checked. Let's go ahead and convert this attribute all lowercase into camel case and
70

71
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,010
add it as an attribute in our JSX file.
71

72
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,530
So already we've got spellcheck being suggested to us and I'm going to set it to false.
72

73
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:41,330
So now when I start editing my h1 and writing some complete gibberish, it's not trying to check
73

74
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:49,220
my spelling anymore. So the most common attribute that you're gonna be adding is going to be the class
74

75
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:56,250
name because this is the preferred way to add styling to your React elements.
75

76
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:03,020
And as you'll see in the next lesson, while there are other ways that we can style these elements including
76

77
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:11,180
inline styling the documentation still recommends to apply all your styling through classes that you
77

78
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:20,380
specify within a CSS file and then applying it to your JSX file using this class name attribute.
78

79
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:26,480
Now remember that just because we're using React to create these HTML  elements and we're learning
79

80
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:34,550
about how to use these attributes in JSX, the rest of what you've learned about CSS or HTML doesn't
80

81
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,380
just become invalid
81

82
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:36,710
right?
82

83
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:45,530
So for example I've got a ul here with a bunch of list items and I can just as I would in normal CSS
83

84
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:54,230
target the ul elements on my page just by writing the word ul and then I go ahead and change the color
84

85
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,150
to blue.
85

86
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:06,120
And now when I go back and refresh my page my ul or my unordered list should turn blue.
86

87
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,920
So in this case I'm not adding any attribute.
87

88
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:16,040
I'm simply saying that on the page if there are any unordered list items make sure that everything inside
88

89
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:23,050
all of its children gets turned blue. So you can target classes using CSS,
89

90
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:30,610
you can target IDs and you can target HTML  elements directly as well. Although in reality, it'd be very
90

91
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,950
rare for you to just broad-stroke
91

92
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:41,860
tell all of the UI elements from now until forever to have a particular style like what we've done here.
92

93
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:48,590
Now I'm going to go ahead and delete this unordered lists and I'm going to replace it with a div.
93

94
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:59,500
Now inside this div I'm going to add three image elements and these are images I found in Google to
94

95
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:05,710
replace each of those things that I've listed in my unordered list.
95

96
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,590
Now here's a challenge for you.
96

97
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:18,100
I want you to do the same thing namely create three image elements like what I've done here and to find
97

98
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:27,250
images via google image search and then to copy the image address and paste it in as the source of the
98

99
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,230
image.
99

100
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:38,320
But here's the catch. I want you to use CSS to change each of these images to have the same size, to be
100

101
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:50,300
squares 100 pixels by 100 pixels. Pause the video and try to complete this challenge.
101

102
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:50,900
All right.
102

103
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:58,090
So we know that in order to change each of these images to 100 by 100, we have to change something
103

104
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,560
in our CSS.
104

105
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:07,520
Now what I want to do is I want to create a class which I'll called food-img and remember that
105

106
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:15,260
in CSS the convention for all of these essentially variable names that you're creating is what's called
106

107
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,520
kebab case.
107

108
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,620
So they're all lowercase and they're separated by a dash.
108

109
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:26,870
Now for all of the elements which get the food-img class I'm going to change its height to 100 pixels
109

110
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:32,260
and its width to a 100 pixels as well.
110

111
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:40,880
Now all I have to do is to apply that class to all three of these image elements. And a neat trick inside
111

112
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:49,040
code sandbox is you can hold down the OPTION or ALT key on your keyboard and take your cursor to all
112

113
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,640
the places where you want to type simultaneously you can see it's now flashing on three lines.
113

114
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:03,110
And here I'm going to add a new attribute called class name and I'm going to set that to equal to that
114

115
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,730
class name that I created just now which is called food-img.
115

116
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:16,370
And now when we hit save and we refresh our website you can see that they are now all rendered as 100
116

117
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:29,330
by 100 pixel images because my CSS is being applied. Now you can also insert JavaScript as an attribute.
117

118
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:37,440
So for example let's use a service called Lorem Picsum where they generate stylish random images
118

119
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,600
just by tapping into a particular URL and specifying the size.
119

120
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,510
So I'm gonna go ahead and copy this URL for the image and then I'm going to create it as a constant and
120

121
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm going to call it img.  And then inside here I'm going to paste a string that holds the URL for
121

122
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,580
a random photo from Picsum.
122

123
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:10,650
And now inside my div I'm gonna create a image element and I'm gonna add the source to be equal to this
123

124
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,100
particular image constant.
124

125
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,840
So as soon as I do that you can see that it shows up over here
125

126
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,690
and if I hit save in fact, you'll see that this closing tag for the image element should disappear and
126

127
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:30,660
it turns into a self closing tag because there are no children or there's nothing in between the opening
127

128
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,250
and closing tags.
128

129
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:42,270
Now remember that normally if you wrote code like this in HTML  where it just has the opening part and
129

130
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,900
no closing part, HTML will forgive you for this.
130

131
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:54,450
You can see that if I go ahead and cut this out of my JSX file and paste it into my actual HTML 
131

132
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:03,210
inside this div, you can see that it will work if I have this backslash which denotes a self closing
132

133
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,810
HTML  element or if I don't,
133

134
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:13,150
which is actually just the opening tag. HTML is really very forgiving
134

135
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:20,400
but JSX is not so forgiving. If you don't have this closing tag then this is not valid
135

136
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:29,730
JSX and you will get an error telling you "Unterminated JSX contents" and we have to add a termination
136

137
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,700
to say that this is the end of this element.
137

138
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:44,400
In this lesson we've seen how we can use Javascript properties as attributes in our JSX, so all of
138

139
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:51,000
the attributes that you are already familiar with from HTML such as src or href
139

140
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:57,600
or all of those things you can use in your JSX. But for all of the attributes that have more than one
140

141
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,640
word, then you have to turn it into a camelcased version of it in order for it to work.
141

142
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:12,960
We also saw that you can use Javascript expressions as the values for the attributes as long as you
142

143
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,520
include them inside a set of curly braces.
143

144
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:23,760
So for example Picsum allows you to turn all the images into grayscale by appending this query
144

145
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,500
"?grayscale" to the end of the URL.
145

146
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:35,700
So in our case we can simply change our Javascript expression to be the image URL plus the
146

147
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,480
?grayscale.
147

148
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:47,940
And now when you refresh it should show you all the images but converted to grayscale. And we're able
148

149
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:56,670
to do this because we're able to use Javascript as the value of our attributes. Now if you're wondering
149

150
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,720
why we're getting so many warnings
150

151
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:06,930
well it's because code sandbox comes pre-built with a linter from eslint. So it will pick up on the
151

152
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,250
things that you're not doing quite right.
152

153
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:16,590
So for example in terms of our image elements, we should always have a alt text that describes to people
153

154
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:23,340
who aren't able to see, who are looking at these websites through screen readers etc., what these images
154

155
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,600
are actually of.
155

156
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:31,460
So if we add some alt text in all of these places, we'll write
156

157
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,450
alt equals
157

158
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:40,460
something space and we can say that this one is random,
158

159
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:46,980
this one is bacon and this one is jamon
159

160
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,290
and this one is going to be noodles.
160

161
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:58,060
So now we get rid of all our warnings from the linter and we provide people with screen readers, who can't
161

162
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:05,090
see, a better description of what's actually on the screen. So I'm going to include the code in this completed
162

163
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,940
lesson as a link in the course resources.
163

164
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,670
So if there's anything that you want to mess around with and especially revisit some of those topics
164

165
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:18,920
that we discussed in this lesson and trying it out for yourself if you haven't already.
165

166
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:25,700
If this is at all confusing I really recommend to just delete the whole thing and then try to recreate
166

167
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:32,510
the end website yourself and see if you can achieve the same results using the things that you've learned
167

168
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:38,210
in this lesson. And you can always refer to this completed code whenever you need to.
168

169
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:45,860
Just take a moment, take a breath and try to get used to this idea of using these attributes and using
169

170
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,220
it to style you'll React elements.
170

171
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,770
Once you're done and comfortable, then head over to the next lesson where we're going to talk more about
171

172
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,080
inline styling in JSX.
