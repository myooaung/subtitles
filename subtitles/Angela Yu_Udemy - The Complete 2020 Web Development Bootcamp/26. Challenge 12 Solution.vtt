00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.120
All right. So here's the answer to challenge
1

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.710
12. We've deleted the console log inside our root route and instead we want to be able to log this array
2

3
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:19.550
called posts inside our home.ejs so that when we create a new post through the compose page then
3

4
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.670
once we get back onto the home page, we should be able to log that new post as well as any others that
4

5
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.750
we've created previously. In order to do this
5

6
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:36.920
we first have to pass over this posts array into the home.ejs  page when we render it. In order to do that
6

7
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.320
we need to add another key value pair to this
7

8
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.710
essentially what is a Javascript object
8

9
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.490
right?
9

10
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.730
Let's add a comma after that one
10

11
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.580
and then let's add our second object.
11

12
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.250
And I'm just going to reformat this so that you can see it a bit more clearly.
12

13
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.480
So the first object has a key of startingContent and a value of homeStartingContent which comes from
13

14
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.060
here.
14

15
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.130
The second object I'm going to call posts and I'm also going to pass over the posts array which comes
15

16
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.150
from over here.
16

17
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.570
So that means that once I render the home.ejs page I should have access to something called posts
17

18
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.590
which should be the array of posts that I've created so far. Inside the home.ejs, all we need to do
18

19
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:32.720
is to console.og that posts array. And remember that this won't work unless we add those EJS  scriptlet
19

20
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.830
tags which look like this.
20

21
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:44.120
And remember that even small things such as curly braces or just a single closing curly brace also need
21

22
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.560
these scriptlet tags for them to work.
22

23
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.390
So let's go ahead and wrap this line of Javascript inside some EJS scriptlet tags which is an angle
23

24
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.680
bracket, percentage sign and then we're going to close it off with again percentage angle bracket.
24

25
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:09.230
So now if we hit save and we head back to our home page and we go over to the compose screen and we
25

26
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:15.710
just compose some sort of post, hit publish and we get redirected back to the home.
26

27
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.200
ejs at which point we should have passed over that posts array.
27

28
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.740
So now if we check our console you can see that logged in here is the same post that we composed earlier
28

29
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.240
on
29

30
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.650
but in this case it's actually being logged from within our home.
30

31
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.310
ejs.
