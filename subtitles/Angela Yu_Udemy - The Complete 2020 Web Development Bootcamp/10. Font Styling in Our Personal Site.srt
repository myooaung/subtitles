00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,120
Now one of the most important decisions that you will have to make when you are designing your web site
1

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,450
is what are the fonts that you're going to choose. And a lot of web designers will start off by figuring
2

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,900
out a color palette as well as a font scheme.
3

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:23,760
So in this lesson we're going to learn about how we can change the fonts for all of our text in our
4

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,580
web site.
5

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,680
Now there are two major font families and that is the Serif and the Sans-serif fonts.
6

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,850
So you can tell Serif and Sans-serif fonts
7

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,860
apart from each other by looking for these little feet at the edges of all of the letters and these
8

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,370
little feet are called serifs.
9

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:54,910
Now we can broadly define whether we want a Sans-serif or a Serif typeface for any text on our website.
10

11
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,390
So let's go ahead and do that.
11

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:08,050
If we go into our stylesheet and we change the font-family property for our body, then we actually affect
12

13
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:17,170
all the text on our web page, and you can see that there's five major families listed here, now only three
13

14
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,560
of which are you actually going to use.
14

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,110
So we've seen Serif and Sans-serif.
15

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:30,910
Now monospace is when each of the characters inside the text take up the same amount of width and that's
16

17
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:36,210
usually a typeface that we use for coding because it makes everything super easy to read.
17

18
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:44,380
For example if this word 'align' was styled in a Serif or Sans-serif typeface, then the i would be squished
18

19
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,500
right next to the l and the g.
19

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:55,190
But because our code is represented in a monospaced font, then you can more easily read each of the letters.
20

21
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,810
So you use these two for your normal web site styling.
21

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,440
And when you do have code on your web page sometimes people like to style it using monospace.
22

23
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:11,560
Now cursive and fantasy are two families that you're never really going to use, firstly because they have
23

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,790
low readability, and secondly because they generally don't look that great when used in the body of a
24

25
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,590
web site.
25

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,570
So cursive is meant to be handwritten style of fonts.
26

27
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,970
And fantasy is meant to remind you of Avatar,
27

28
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:34,590
basically. So let's take a look at what each of these families look like.
28

29
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:42,510
So let's first define a font family of Serif. And let's head back over to our web site and we hit refresh.
29

30
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,370
You'll notice that nothing happens. By default
30

31
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,440
we already have a Serif family.
31

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,710
You can see that at the end of the I's
32

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,930
we've already got these little feet.
33

34
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,270
Now if we change that to Sans-serif, however, we will get a noticeable change.
34

35
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,770
And those little feet or those little serifs now disappear, and we have a different style.
35

36
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:12,210
Now for most browsers the default Serif is the Times font and the default Sans-serif is Arial, and this
36

37
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,640
is the Arial font.
37

38
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,660
Now if we changed this to fantasy then it will still work,
38

39
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,520
it just now looks like I'm producing the next Avatar.
39

40
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:32,000
So let's head back to a Sans-serif typeface, and I'm not really satisfied with just an Arial
40

41
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,490
font.
41

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,320
What if I want a different Sans-serif font?
42

43
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,870
Let's say that, instead of Arial, I would rather have Verdana as the font for my website.
43

44
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:49,800
Now what I can do is instead of specifying just the Sans-serif broad stroke family, I can add a specific
44

45
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,350
font or typeface in front.
45

46
00:03:52,470 --> 00:04:01,290
For example, if I wanted the Verdana font, then I can simply type verdana, and then have a comma, and then
46

47
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,650
separate that from the sans-serif family.
47

48
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:12,160
And now if we head back over here and refresh you can see I'm now using the Verdana font.
48

49
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:19,320
And what this line of code does is that it sets the font family for all the text inside the body but
49

50
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:25,620
it first asks the browser to try and render all the text in the Verdana font.
50

51
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,980
Now if for some reason the browser or the operating system that the user is using doesn't have this
51

52
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:39,290
font installed, then it will default to whatever is the Sans-serif font that is installed on their system.
52

53
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,060
Now that's a little bit scary because that kind of means that I might think that I've designed my web
53

54
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,200
site to look like this,
54

55
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:52,830
and I think it looks perfect just like this, but on somebody else's system or browser they might be getting
55

56
00:04:52,830 --> 00:05:00,450
a completely different style with different font heights and just a different look and feel.
56

57
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,970
So there is such a thing called web safe fonts.
57

58
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:13,500
Now what this means is that there is a set of font families where most operating systems will be able
58

59
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,560
to render it correctly.
59

60
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:22,860
And for the Serifs that includes Georgia, Times New Roman, for the Sans-serif that includes Arial, Comic
60

61
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,120
Sans, Impact, etc..
61

62
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:31,950
Although these are called web safe fonts and it's basically saying that if you choose these sets of
62

63
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:39,210
fonts then you have the maximum chance of getting it rendered correctly as you're seeing yourself when
63

64
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,190
you're designing it,
64

65
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,550
but actually no font is actually 100 percent web safe.
65

66
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:53,400
And if you had ever to see cssfontstack.com, then somebody has actually painstakingly listed all
66

67
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:00,570
of the fonts that are in common usage and what is the percentage of users who have it installed, separated
67

68
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,690
by their operating system.
68

69
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,990
So as you can see the font that most people have is Arial.
69

70
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:13,490
So 99.8 percent installation of Windows, 98.7 percent on the Mac.
70

71
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,690
Now that is really really high.
71

72
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:23,040
But for some other fonts you'll see a difference between the Mac and the Windows operating systems and
72

73
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,390
we're not even including Linux users here.
73

74
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:32,220
So for example if you look at something like Helvetica which is a Apple specific thing, then on Windows
74

75
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,580
installation rate is really really low.
75

76
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,820
And on Mac it's 100 percent because it comes pre-installed with all Mac OS.
76

77
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:48,960
So what can you do if you want to use a font but you're not sure if everyone has it installed, right?
77

78
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,840
For example if I want to use Helvetica then there's only 7 percent of users on Windows who are going
78

79
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,040
to see it rendered in that font.
79

80
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,960
Well then you would need fallbacks.
80

81
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:08,700
So if we click on this little icon here on Font Stack, then we actually copy a set of fallbacks for this
81

82
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,970
Helvetica font.
82

83
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:20,370
And if I go ahead and paste that and replace our font family, then you can see that we have a stack of
83

84
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,460
fallbacks.
84

85
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:28,890
So I'm basically saying that I want the font family to be Helvetica Neue if they have it, and if they
85

86
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:35,340
have an Apple system then it's very likely that they will have this font installed. If they don't have
86

87
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,080
it, then default to the next best thing which is Helvetica.
87

88
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,770
And if they don't have that then default to Arial.
88

89
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,320
And finally just go with whatever Sans-serif they've got installed
89

90
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,840
if they don't even have Arial, which is very unlikely, but you can see how we're going from specific
90

91
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:59,560
to less specific and all the while ensuring that we're getting roughly a similar sort of typeface and
91

92
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,910
similar sort of feel no matter which fonts the users have installed or not installed.
92

93
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:13,480
So if we hit save and we go back to our web site, then you can see that on the Mac I do indeed have Helvetica
93

94
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,940
Neue installed.
94

95
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,090
And that's what's currently being rendered on screen.
95

96
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,670
But if I was on Windows then I might be seeing Arial
96

97
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,410
in this case.
97

98
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:28,060
And you can go ahead and give it a go and have a look at these font stacks and copy them over to your
98

99
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,360
web page and see what you're able to get.
99

100
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,080
Now what if we were even more picky as designers?
100

101
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:43,270
What if I really want everybody who looks at my web site to see exactly the same thing as I designed
101

102
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:43,450
it?
102

103
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:49,450
I want them to see the design that I intended instead of whatever font it is that they happened to have
103

104
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,950
installed.
104

105
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:57,340
And for example if I was using Helvetica then pretty much like 93 percent of Windows users are just
105

106
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,520
going to see Arial.
106

107
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,210
What if I really hate Arial?
107

108
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:08,590
What can I do to ensure that everybody has the same viewing experience with regards to the fonts on
108

109
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,400
my web site?
109

110
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,120
Well, you could use something called font embedding.
110

111
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:20,650
So if we head over to fonts.google.com, then you can see that they've got a whole bunch of font
111

112
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,520
families that you can choose from.
112

113
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:31,700
And these are all fonts that are free for commercial use that you can simply embed into your website.
113

114
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,600
And there's a large choice of font families that you can pick through so you can choose whether you
114

115
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,670
want just Serif fonts to look through, or Sans-serif, they have these cool articles about which fonts
115

116
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,660
go well with which and a whole bunch of really really useful stuff actually.
116

117
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:58,500
But in my case I already know what it is that I want. I want a font called Merriweather for my body.
117

118
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:05,770
So I'm just going to add this plus sign, and this is a pretty kind of Serif font. If you click on it, it actually
118

119
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,770
shows you what the characters look like,
119

120
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,940
who designed it,
120

121
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,150
what is it about,
121

122
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,210
what is the usage currently,
122

123
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,140
what are the different styles, different weights,
123

124
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,920
what do they all look like?
124

125
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,570
It's even got things like loading speed and popular pairings, for example.
125

126
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,620
So this is one of the fonts that I want and that's going to be for the body text.
126

127
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:35,340
So I'm just going to go ahead and click add. Now I'm going to go ahead and add a few more different fonts
127

128
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,710
before I show you how we're going to incorporate this.
128

129
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,570
So the other one that I'm going to pick up is a handwriting font actually.
129

130
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,540
It's called Sacramento and this I'm going to use as the font for my h1,
130

131
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:53,730
so a very stylish sort of font where we don't really need people to read it that clearly.
131

132
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,720
So it's not like a body font, where it would be quite painful to try and read through, you know, 300 words all styled
132

133
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,820
like this.
133

134
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,530
So let's go ahead and add that to.
134

135
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:10,300
So we've got now two selected, and the last thing that I want is my main heading font, and that is going
135

136
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,400
to be a Sans-serif, and one that I'm quite partial to is the Montserrat,
136

137
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,630
so I'm going to go ahead and add that as well.
137

138
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,760
So now I've got three font families selected.
138

139
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:31,090
And I can embedd it into my website as easily as copying this link and pasting that at the top of my
139

140
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,800
index.html. I'm just going to paste that link in there.
140

141
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:43,660
And this specifies a location where, if users don't have these fonts already installed or cached on their
141

142
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:51,250
system, then the browser will take them to this location and grab those fonts for them.
142

143
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:57,900
And then if we go into the styles.css, then I can specify a font family that I want to use.
143

144
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:06,220
So the one that I want for my body is the Merriweather font, and I'm going to paste that in here and it
144

145
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,530
will default to Serif
145

146
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,370
if something terrible happens, say the Internet connection went down in the middle of downloading the
146

147
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,870
font etc., but you can see it's not a large font stack because in pretty much 99.9999
147

148
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:24,030
percent of the time this is the font that everybody is going to see because we are embedding
148

149
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,240
it instead of presuming that people already have it.
149

150
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:38,040
Now for my h1 I'm going to use the Sacramento and for my h2 and also h3s
150

151
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,810
I'm going to use the Montserrat.
151

152
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,310
So let's go ahead and put those in there.
152

153
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,610
And let's just hit beautify to rearrange everything.
153

154
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,350
Let's hit save, take ourselves back over to our web site,
154

155
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,630
hit refresh and voila.
155

156
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:03,050
Our text is now beautifully styled using the fonts that we chose from Google Fonts.
156

157
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:09,070
So feel free to have a mess around with the different fonts that you might like or you might want to
157

158
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,830
incorporate to your web site and then simply add them to your selection,
158

159
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:23,080
include the link in your index.html, and start using them in your CSS like so. Now in the next
159

160
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,800
lesson,
160

161
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:30,160
I want to go and do a deep dive on different fonts and different typefaces, what are the different families
161

162
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,930
and how they came about.
162

163
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:39,380
So just a lesson on one of the most crucial parts of digital design and that's of course typography.
163

164
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,970
So if you're interested then that is what you will get on the next lesson.
164

165
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,670
If you're not interested then you can feel free and go ahead and skip ahead to the next lesson where
165

166
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:56,650
we explore some of the other font and text properties that we can use to style our text on our web site.
166

167
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,100
So I'll see you on the next lesson.
