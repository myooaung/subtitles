00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.710
Now a lot of students are taking this course because you want to get a job.
1

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.130
And I have some pieces of advice that I often give students who are in your position.
2

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.390
One of the first things to do is don't worry about your qualifications. Your interviewers will care far
3

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.100
more about what you can do than where you've studied.
4

5
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.890
Now admittedly, there are companies where they have a blanket rule where nobody gets in the door unless
5

6
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.610
they have X degree from X university but the majority of companies aren't like this.
6

7
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.420
They'll look at what you can do.
7

8
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.030
So show them what you can do,
8

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.630
build a portfolio.
9

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.750
Have a look at some of the job listings on Indeed or LinkedIn and look at the skills that the recruiters
10

11
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.130
are looking for.
11

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.620
And then based on those skills and those pieces of-- and those expertise and the expertise that they're
12

13
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.140
looking for, try to build a project that demonstrates that.
13

14
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.910
And then once you've built up all your projects
14

15
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.090
think about how you can help other developers like answering questions on Stack Overflow or going into
15

16
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.940
the Q/A and helping other students because another really really important thing for recruiters
16

17
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.730
is knowing that you work well with other people, including people who are senior to you
17

18
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.950
so people who you can learn from, and people who are junior to you, people who you can teach.
18

19
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.180
So I believe that at any moment in time there's always people who will be above you and below you.
19

20
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.420
And a true team worker, somebody who's going to perform really really well in a company, is somebody who
20

21
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.610
can handle both sides really well.
21

22
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.830
So practice and see how you can demonstrate that to a recruiter.
22

23
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.260
Start building up your Stack Overflow reputation or start doing some code reviews with some developers
23

24
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.860
who are more senior to you.
24

25
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.490
And this way you'll be able to demonstrate not only are you really capable based on your project but
25

26
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.700
also you have the interpersonal skills to make it at the company.
26

27
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.890
So have a think about how you can pursue some of those things
27

28
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.120
I spoke about and keep going.
