1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.630
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.700
So at this stage you should have already downloaded the starting project and you would have installed
2

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.940
all of the required NPM modules.
3

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.230
If you haven't, make sure you take a look at the last lesson where we did this so that we're ready to
4

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.250
proceed.
5

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.980
Now once you're done then you're ready to tackle Challenge 1.
6

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.280
So in order to complete challenge 1, you should be able to head over to localhost:3000
7

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:33.540
and when you hit enter it should render the home page and it will have an h1 but just says Home.
8

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.340
So in your home.ejs you'll need to create an h1 that says Home and by writing some code inside
9

10
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.330
app.js, you should be able to get this to show up on localhost:3000.
10

11
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.820
So that's Challenge 1.
11

12
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.040
Pause the video and see if you can complete the challenge.
12

13
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.410
All right so if you completed that challenge and you manage get the same result as I showed you when
13

14
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.000
I introduced the challenge then that means you get a gold star for this challenge.
14

15
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.400
Then you can skip the rest of this lesson and head over to the next lesson
15

16
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.630
where I'll show you how I implemented the answer.
16

17
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.070
Now if you're stuck on this challenge and you don't know how to proceed then after the spoiler alert
17

18
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.520
there will be a five second countdown.
18

19
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.380
Now you can either pause during the countdown, try and work out the challenge yourself or you can let
19

20
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.710
the video play and I'll give you your first hint.
20

21
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.250
So here comes the countdown.
21

22
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.990
All right.
22

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.830
So this is Hint number 1.
23

24
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.450
So the first hint is we know that inside home.
24

25
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.020
ejs
25

26
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.210
we've got our h1. And this page is what we need to render from our server.
26

27
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.320
So the place where we normally write our routes and where we render our EJS pages is between the app
27

28
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.290
.set app.use and our app.listen.
28

29
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.080
So we've got a gap right here that's already prepared for you to add your code.
29

30
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:11.580
Now if you're remember, we create routes inside our server by saying app.get. And then we specify
30

31
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.400
what route we want to target and then we add a callback function
31

32
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:27.530
so a req and a res. And we open up a set of curly braces and inside the set of curly braces is where
32

33
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.140
we render our Web page.
33

34
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.530
So have a think about what you need to put in between these quotation marks in order to render the home
34

35
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.590
page and then have a think about what you need to write inside here
35

36
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.730
in order to render our home.ejs.
36

37
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.320
So pause the video now and use that hint to complete the challenge. Still stuck?
37

38
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.020
OK.
38

39
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.070
Here's hint number 2.
39

40
00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.070
In between the quotation marks we need to specify the route that we want to target. And in our case we
40

41
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.190
need to target the home route or what's known as the root route.
41

42
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.770
So when we have something like "www.facebook.com/", that is the root route.
42

43
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.020
So in our case that's just localhost:3000.
43

44
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.800
So that means inside here, all we have to write is just a single forward slash to specify that we want
44

45
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.960
to target this route.
45

46
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.300
Now inside our app.get is where we're going to render our home.
46

47
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.400
ejs.
47

48
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.630
And the method for that is res.
48

49
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.960
So this is the result that we are going to send back from the server to the user who's requesting this
49

50
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:46.660
page and we're going to use the render method that Express gives us to be able to render our home.
50

51
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.700
ejs.
51

52
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.500
So have a think about what else you might need to put in between those parentheses in order to get this
52

53
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.710
code to work.
53

54
00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.910
Have a play around with the code and pause the video now to see if you can now complete the challenge.
