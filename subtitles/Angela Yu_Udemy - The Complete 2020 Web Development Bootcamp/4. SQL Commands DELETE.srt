Now in the last lesson we looked at how to update records in our tables and we looked at the SQL 
1

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,210
UPDATE statement.
2

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,610
Now in this lesson we're going to look at the last letter of CRUD which is DELETE.
3

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:24,460
And if we wanted to delete records then we can simply write DELETE FROM table name where something meets
4

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,950
a certain condition.
5

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,590
So for example if I want to delete my record of my pencil say if I no longer sell pencils anymore in
6

7
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:47,030
my shop then I can simply say DELETE FROM products table where the name is equal to pencil or what would
7

8
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:53,410
be better is if I actually use its id, where id is equal to 2. Now
8

9
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,500
again be careful that you don't run the statement without a WHERE statement because that will delete
9

10
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,870
everything in your products table and you'll end up losing all of the data.
10

11
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:12,320
So it's again a dangerous statement to execute and make sure that you check your statement before you
11

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,860
hit the run button.
12

13
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:22,800
And now our products table only has one entry left. But through this process you've seen how we can use
13

14
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:30,990
the Structured Query Language to Create, Read, Update and Delete data from our SQL table.
