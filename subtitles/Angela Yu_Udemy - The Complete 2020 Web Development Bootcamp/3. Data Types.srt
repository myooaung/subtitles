1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,060
All right.
1

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,280
Welcome back guys.
2

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,280
In the last lesson we saw how we could use the alert keyword in javascript to create a pop up in our
3

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,420
browser and the pop up would say whatever is in between the two round brackets. In this case it would
4

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,510
be Hello.
5

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:25,020
Now how does the browser know which part of this code is actual code i.e. keywords like alert and which
6

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,240
parts of this line is the text that we want to display?
7

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,210
Well there’s something that we've added here that tells the browser that this is a string, and the secret
8

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,360
is of course these two little quotation marks because everything that they enclose gets interpreted
9

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:50,240
by the computer as a string so that it gets taken out of the code and gets interpreted as text.
10

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,400
And this is really important because all the code that we write is written with text, right, with characters
11

12
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,940
in the English alphabet.
12

13
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,700
And it's really important that the computer knows which parts are the code and which parts are the text.
13

14
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,500
And this is a great place to introduce you to something called data types because a string is exactly
14

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:10,860
that.
15

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,380
It's a data type.
16

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,610
It's a way of classifying data to tell the computer how the program intends to use the data.
17

18
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,960
In this case it's simply the text that we want to be displayed in our pop up and you will see this data
18

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,030
type across all programming languages and it's pretty much always called a string.
19

20
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,070
And that's because it's simply a string of characters just as you would have a string of pearls.
20

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,090
And in the coming lessons whenever I refer to string I'm always talking about text that's not meant
21

22
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,070
to be interpreted as code or just a string of characters.
22

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,340
Now there are other data types other than strings.
23

24
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,140
For example there are numbers, and numbers, because they have different symbols from the alphabet than
24

25
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,760
we use for code,
25

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,330
then we don't actually need any special symbols to tell the computer that this is a number.
26

27
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,350
We can just simply type the number. And finally, the last data type I want to show you is the boolean.
27

28
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,190
And this is the data type that describes data that is either true or false.
28

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,090
And we're going to be using a combination of all of these data types in order to create the programs
29

30
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,020
and the web sites in the coming lessons and modules.
30

31
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,750
So this really is the groundwork and it's the fundamentals of how all programming languages work.
31

32
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,330
So let's take a look at this in more detail.
32

33
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,580
I want you to open up your console so you can do that by going to View, Developer, Javascript Console,
33

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,490
and you'll see it show up down here. And, in the console,
34

35
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,400
you can do a number of things. So you can, for example, add numbers to each other.
35

36
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,140
So 2 + 3 equals 5.
36

37
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,470
And you get an output after you hit enter. You can also write the code that we wrote before which is the
37

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,610
alert keyword and that tells the browser that we want a pop up that says the output of 2 + 3.
38

39
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,100
So once I hit enter I will get a pop up that says 5.
39

40
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,210
Now I want to show you another keyword other than the alert,
40

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,070
and this is called typeof.
41

42
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,670
And this actually tells you what is the data type of whatever it is that you put within these round
42

43
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,240
brackets.
43

44
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:21,050
So, for example, if I put 23 in here, then I will get the output of,
44

45
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:29,010
this is a number, but if I wrote something like typeof my name inside some quotation marks, then I
45

46
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,400
get told that this is a string.
46

47
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,490
And finally, let's just, for completion sake, use a boolean, for example true, then I get told that this
47

48
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,920
is a boolean.
48

49
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,510
So in the coming lessons and modules we'll be using all of these different data types in order to create
49

50
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:51,000
our web sites and web apps. And understanding the fact that different pieces of data can have different
50

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,240
data types will be a foundation block towards building those web sites and web apps.
51

52
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,570
Now, in the next lesson we're going to talk about another foundation block for all programming languages,
52

53
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,510
which is the variable.
53

54
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,610
So for all of that and more, I’ll see you on the next lesson.
