1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,780
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,530
So first things first. Let's first install MongoDB onto our local system so that we can actually
2

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,850
start using it.
3

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:16,860
So if you head over to mongodb.com and just click on get MongoDB then this should take you to
4

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,760
the downloads page. And you can see that they have three options for you to choose from: cloud which is
5

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,110
MongoDB Atlas
6

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,700
and this is what we'll explore a little bit later on when we deploy our application.
7

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:38,820
But for now we need to click on servers and we're going to choose the free community server and make
8

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,040
sure that you've got your version selected as current release. The development release is kind of like
9

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,280
the beta version and then there's previous versions which are a little bit older which still work just
10

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,080
fine but at the time when you're watching this video the current release might no longer be 4.0.3
11

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,340
but I still want you to choose the current release because we will be keeping the videos up to date
12

13
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,980
so that you'll be able to work with the latest versions.
13

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,850
And then it's automatically detected that
14

15
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,870
I am running on a Mac.
15

16
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,070
Now we're ready to go ahead and click download and it's not too large a file so it should be done pretty
16

17
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,870
quickly.
17

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,190
Now if you open up your Downloads folder you should see that compressed file that we just downloaded.
18

19
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,150
And this is what we'll need to get MongoDB working on our local system.
19

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:36,590
So now just double click on it to extract it and we can delete the tgz file that we initially had.
20

21
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,610
This is going to allow us to use MongoDB on our local system.
21

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,880
Now there's a couple more things that we have to do in order to get it to work.
22

23
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:52,140
And if you scroll down here, you can see there's this part where it says Quick Start Guide. And there's
23

24
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,450
a few things here that we still need to do in order to get set up with MongoDB.
24

25
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,930
So on this page if you scroll down a little bit up to the point where it says installing MongoDB community
25

26
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,860
edition manually, we've already done step 1.
26

27
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,590
We've really downloaded the tarball and we've extracted the files.
27

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,190
So now we're on to step 4.
28

29
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,660
Not quite sure where it jumps from 2 to 4.
29

30
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:25,120
But either way now we have to ensure that the binaries are in a directory listed in your PATH environment
30

31
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,200
variable.
31

32
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,480
Ok so this is a little bit confusing but I'll walk you through it step by step.
32

33
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,380
All right so now that we've extracted the files we're going to open up a new terminal using hyper and
33

34
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:45,970
then we're going to type sudo mv and we're going to use this command to move our existing file currently
34

35
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:52,660
inside our downloads folder to a location that will be in the root of our computers so that all users
35

36
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,300
will be able to access it.
36

37
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,810
So we're going to specify what it is that we want to move first and then we're going to add a space
37

38
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:06,340
and then we're going to specify where we want to move it. And the location is going to be / user
38

39
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,480
'usr' /local/mongodb.
39

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,470
And this is all lowercase and it's really really important that you check that you've got that first
40

41
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,170
forward slash there before the user and that you've spelt everything correctly.
41

42
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,390
Otherwise this will not work and it will have more issues down the line.
42

43
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:33,720
So all we did was we typed sudo move and then we clicked and dragged the location of our current MongoDB
43

44
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,010
binary
44

45
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,930
and so that's inputted that entire path in order to get to that file.
45

46
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:47,290
Now if we hit enter it will ask us for our password because we're using that sudo there which is super
46

47
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,100
user do.
47

48
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,180
So we need admin privileges.
48

49
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:56,770
So just go ahead and type the password that you normally use to log on to your Mac under your current
49

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,180
user name.
50

51
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,070
So for me that's angelayu.
51

52
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,490
And then go ahead and hit enter.
52

53
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,110
Now when you are typing that password you're not going to see any asterisks or anything move.
53

54
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,290
So just make sure that you actually type it out correctly.
54

55
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,030
And if you get it wrong it'll just prompt you to type it again and you'll just have to do that blind.
55

56
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,220
But once you're done you should get back your prompt which is your user name and the dollar sign which
56

57
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,010
means that you're ready to go for your next command.
57

58
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,400
So now we're going to just check to make sure that it did get moved there.
58

59
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:38,350
So we're going to type open /usr/local/mongodb just to open up that
59

60
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,760
folder inside Finder.
60

61
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,450
We can see
61

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,050
Oh yes
62

63
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,140
all of those files all of those binaries have indeed been moved into a folder called mongodb inside
63

64
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,630
something called local inside something called user.
64

65
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:57,970
And you can see this user is actually a little bit of a light colored blue for its folder icon and this
65

66
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,560
is because it's normally hidden.
66

67
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,380
So unless when we were using this command we wouldn't normally be able to navigate here.
67

68
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,960
All right so now that we confirmed that everything has been moved correctly, the next step is to add
68

69
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,710
the MongoDB binaries to something called environment variables.
69

70
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,030
And this is basically this step here.
70

71
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,440
And we basically need to tell our Mac when it starts up
71

72
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,670
what is the file path to access our
72

73
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:30,690
MongoDB. In order to do this we're going to make sure that we're in our home folder.
73

74
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:37,860
So if you're not sure just type cd ~ and that will take you to your home folder which is here.
74

75
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,930
And you could also just write 'pwd' which is print working directory to make sure that you are inside
75

76
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:50,860
/usr/your current user name because it is at this location that we're going to create
76

77
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:56,430
a new file and this file is going to be called .bash
77

78
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,920
_profile and you're going to go ahead and hit enter.
78

79
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:09,390
So now if we do an ls -a you should see that file that we created just now inside the list of hidden
79

80
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:09,770
files
80

81
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,670
and that's what that little dot means it just means that it's a hidden file where normally if you just
81

82
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,650
hit open at this location you shouldn't be able to see it.
82

83
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,110
OK so now that we've done that, the next step is we're going to edit that file and we're going to use
83

84
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,050
a editor on the command line called vim.
84

85
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:38,100
So we're going to say vim .bash_profile to open this file that we just created inside
85

86
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,000
vim.
86

87
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:46,140
Now vim is notorious for being difficult to work with because it doesn't have a graphical user interface,
87

88
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,100
it doesn't have buttons for you to click on.
88

89
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,840
It just has a whole bunch of text commands.
89

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,520
And the first thing you have to overcome to actually be able to even write anything inside vim is figure
90

91
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,530
out how you get into insert mode because at the moment you might not even be able to start typing.
91

92
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,000
So in order to get into the insert mode, all you have to do is hit i
92

93
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,190
and this takes you into insert mode as it's shown down here.
93

94
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,630
And now we can start typing.
94

95
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:26,510
So what we want to type in here is export PATH=$PATH:/usr/
95

96
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:32,180
local/mongodb/bin.
96

97
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:38,370
If this is a bit painful for you to type or you just wanted a guide on how to do this
97

98
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,290
then remember you can always head over to our blog post which are how to install MongoDB on Mac
98

99
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,500
which is linked to in the resources page.
99

100
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,660
So now if you just go ahead and copy this line inside
100

101
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,760
step 4
101

102
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:00,020
and now we just have to copy this line and you can simply paste it into vim if you wish.
102

103
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,290
So essentially once we've done that and we're happy with this being spelt exactly correct
103

104
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,830
and again if you're not sure and you have any problems then just try and paste that in.
104

105
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,910
The next thing we're going to do is we're going to exit insert mode which we'll do with the ESC key
105

106
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:22,970
and now we have the opportunity to save and exit vim which again is a bit tricky.
106

107
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:30,970
We have to type :wq! and this will just save what we've currently
107

108
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,990
got and quit vim.
108

109
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:39,610
So now when we hit enter we should be back on our familiar command line and our bash_profile should have
109

110
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,710
been edited.
110

111
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:49,010
The next step is we're going to create a folder on our computer where we will store all of our databases.
111

112
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,770
So we're going to simply just copy this command make directory at the root path which is what that forward
112

113
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,850
slash means and then create a folder called data
113

114
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,870
ff it doesn't exist and inside that folder create one called db. And that p flag
114

115
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,450
just makes sure that we create all of the folders that we require all in the same go instead of creating
115

116
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,810
data and cding into data and then creating db.
116

117
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,300
So it was just a little bit of a shortcut.
117

118
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:21,620
So we're going to go ahead and copy and paste that into our command line and hit enter and it doesn't
118

119
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,880
actually matter where you are in your command line.
119

120
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,260
You can be at your home folder or you can be anywhere else because this forward slash that starts
120

121
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,990
this line off indicates that we should go to the root or the Macintosh hard drive and then create our
121

122
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,870
data folder there. Now that we've created that folder there if you wanted to just check you can always say
122

123
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:49,460
open /data/db and that will open it inside our Finder and you can see we've created
123

124
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,500
two new folders in one go
124

125
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,050
using that line there.
125

126
00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:00,350
All right so now that we're done here the next thing is to set permissions for that data directory so
126

127
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,420
that the current user can have read and write permissions.
127

128
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,070
And before we do that you first want to know what your current user name is.
128

129
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:15,320
So it's pretty obvious if you just look at the prompt, the part before the dollar sign is basically your
129

130
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,960
username that you want to be able to set to have read and write privileges on those new folders that
130

131
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,030
we created.
131

132
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,280
But if you're ever unsure you can also just type
132

133
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,720
whoami
133

134
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,830
into the command line and
134

135
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,470
it'll tell you this is your username.
135

136
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,640
So now that we've got our user name we're going to set those privileges so
136

137
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,320
we're going to write sudo code to invoke our admin privileges and then we're going to write chown
137

138
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:46,820
so 'chown' and then we're going to write our username which is what I got here after I typed
138

139
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,690
in who am I.
139

140
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:54,530
So for me it's angelayu and then I'm going to type the directory path that I want to own which is
140

141
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,830
going to be /data/db.
141

142
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:05,780
So now my current user angelayu actually has read and write admin privileges to that db folder
142

143
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,160
and I'll be able to create databases in there, read to it, write to it
143

144
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,900
etc.
144

145
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,720
So now once I hit enter it will ask me for my password again which I'll just type in.
145

146
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,310
And now we should be good to go.
146

147
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:26,630
Now before we test it, the first thing to do is to simply quit the terminal. And we're going to open up
147

148
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,570
a new fresh instance.
148

149
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:38,150
And here we're going to type mongo --version and when we hit enter
149

150
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:43,850
if you get something that looks like this where it tells you MongoDB shell version is 4.0.3
150

151
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:51,070
then that means that everything is all set up and you are ready to go and proceed to the next step where
151

152
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,000
I will learn all about MongoDB.
152

153
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,590
Now if at this stage you get something like bash mongo not found then it means that there might have
153

154
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:05,560
been something that would have gone wrong in the steps that led to this point.
154

155
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,480
So it might be worth just reviewing the steps again in the blog post and just go ahead and step by step
155

156
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:21,680
confirm that everything's been done to the exact spelling and exact casing and just make sure that you
156

157
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,900
haven't missed out any steps as well.
157

158
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,480
But if you've gotten to this stage then
158

159
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:31,520
well-done congratulations. You've finally managed to install MongoDB on your local system and you are
159

160
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,060
ready to proceed to the next step.
