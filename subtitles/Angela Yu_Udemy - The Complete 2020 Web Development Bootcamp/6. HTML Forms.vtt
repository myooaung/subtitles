00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:00.990
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.300
So I've added a few more details here and there to this personal site and it's now really coming along
2

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.110
and starting to look like a real web site that you might come across
3

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:18.520
browsing the web. Now, the next thing that I want to do is, when we go to the Contact Me page, it's a little
4

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.890
bit sparse at the moment.
5

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.740
It's only got my fictional address, my fictional number and my fictional e-mail.
6

7
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:32.050
Now what if I could add a form at the end of this where I allow people to put down their name and their
7

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.250
e-mail and they could message me using that form.
8

9
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.560
How would we do that in HTML?
9

10
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.280
So of course first place to head to is the MDN Web Docs.
10

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.250
And we've got our form element.
11

12
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.030
Now you can read through all of these attributes and start getting an understanding about how a form
12

13
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.410
works and how you can put one together.
13

14
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.940
Now in order for forms to really come alive and to work as you would expect them to,
14

15
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.000
it actually requires a little bit more than just HTML, because we need to specify the behavior of the
15

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.480
form so we can design the form and we can structure the form for our web site.
16

17
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.870
But until we learn about Javascript we won't be able to tap into its full functionality just yet but
17

18
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.340
we can get pretty close.
18

19
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.710
So let's go ahead and create a brand new form inside our contact-me.html
19

20
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.000
page, so just below the last paragraph tag.
20

21
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:39.970
Let's add a brand new form and you can see that with the auto suggest these are the default things that
21

22
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.960
come up.
22

23
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.790
Now I'm going to keep them as they are.
23

24
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.550
We're going to go inside the form tag and we're going to create our first label.
24

25
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.730
Now our first label is simply going to be called your name.
25

26
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.950
So this is where we ask our user for their name input and in order to store that information or allow
26

27
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.930
them to type that information we need to add an input and the type of input is going to be text.
27

28
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.490
So it's just going to be a text box that allows them to put in their name.
28

29
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.780
And if we hit save and check out what our web site looks like at the moment then you can see we've got our
29

30
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.090
label here and we've got a box where somebody can type in some inputs.
30

31
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.070
Now the thing that we’re missing is a submit button. Now a submit button also falls under the inputs of
31

32
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.130
a form and you can see it right here.
32

33
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.430
It's simply an input; instead of having a type of text,
33

34
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.610
it has the type of submit, and all you need to do is to change the word text to submit and delete the value
34

35
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.700
attribute and hit save and refresh.
35

36
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.440
You'll see that you get the submit button without having to put in any extra effort.
36

37
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.430
So that's the beauty of some of these form inputs.
37

38
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.020
And we can check out some of the other ones inside the docs by going to the related topics and there's
38

39
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.890
loads of different types of inputs.
39

40
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.030
There's buttons which are inputs, there’s checkboxes, color, date...
40

41
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.250
Let's give some of them a try and see what they look like on screen.
41

42
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.510
So just before the submit button let's add an input that has type maybe color.
42

43
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.560
And of course remember you have to spell it the American way with a single o instead of ou.
43

44
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.150
So let's hit save and refresh and you can see we now have a color picker on our Web site.
44

45
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.260
And when you click on it it brings up the color picker where we can select any color we like.
45

46
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.800
And you might submit a form that maybe has your favorite color or change the website using a color picker
46

47
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.690
input.
47

48
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:55.340
Another cool one is the checkbox so we can add a checkbox by using input and changing text to check
48

49
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.020
box, hit save,
49

50
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.850
hit refresh, and you see we now have a little checkbox. So you can have,
50

51
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.740
so usually what would happen is,
51

52
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.270
so let's just put a line break here forcing this to go onto the next line.
52

53
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:21.150
Let's create a label where it says ‘Do you want to sign up to the email list?’, and hit save, refresh.
53

54
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.920
You can see you've got this classic checkbox.
54

55
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.180
‘Do you want to sign up to the email list?’, check or uncheck and hit submit, or you can put something like ‘Have you read
55

56
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.200
the terms and conditions?’, or any other thing that might fit with a checkbox.
56

57
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.640
Now the last one that I want to show you before we proceed was the password input.
57

58
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.280
So let's delete the checkbox and let's add a password input.
58

59
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.060
So the cool thing about the password input is that when you type anything inside this box,
59

60
00:04:51.110 --> 00:05:00.240
so ideally you'd want a label, of course, here to show that this is the password, but we know this is a
60

61
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.110
password field because you can either right click and hit inspect and you'll see that this is our password
61

62
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:13.530
input or you know that the next thing that comes after the password label is of course the password
62

63
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.310
input.
63

64
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.540
But whenever you type anything in here by default everything you type is masked.
64

65
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.200
So these are the fields where you don't want somebody overlooking the user to be able to see what their 
65

66
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.480
password is.
66

67
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:33.090
So feel free to have a bit of fun and try out all of these different input types and see what they look
67

68
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.330
like and see what they do.
68

69
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.620
And once you do that you'll come to realize that a lot of the things that you see on the web are just
69

70
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.270
very simple HTML inputs.
70

71
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.800
And as we build our knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript, we're going to come back and see how
71

72
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.740
forms work in more detail. So have an explore of that and see what they all look like when you just
72

73
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.000
add them to your web site.
73

74
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.160
But we'll experience a full functionality
74

75
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.700
a little bit later on.
75

76
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.890
Now let's just quickly review what we've learned about HTML forms.
76

77
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:12.900
So we use the form tag to define what should go into our form and this by itself doesn't actually do
77

78
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.680
anything.
78

79
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.310
So in order for the form to do anything you'll need two important HTML elements, and that's the label
79

80
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.970
and the input and between the opening and closing label tags you can write some text that will be displayed
80

81
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.580
as a label inside your form.
81

82
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:36.210
Now the next most important HTML element that is associated with forms are the inputs and the input
82

83
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.580
is a self closing tag.
83

84
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.760
So it doesn't have a closing tag.
84

85
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:48.300
Instead you can define the input type by using the type attribute and there's a whole bunch of input
85

86
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.190
types that you can tap into to use inside your form.
86

87
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.960
For example in this case the type is set to text.
87

88
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:03.300
So we get a text box where the user can input their name but you can also use an input element that
88

89
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.150
has the type attribute set as submit.
89

90
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.250
And this creates a button.
90

91
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:15.570
So you can see that by setting the attribute type to various predefined keywords you actually end up
91

92
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.820
with completely different things on your website.
92

93
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:26.580
And it might seem strange that even though we're using the same HTML element, i.e. the input, we're actually
93

94
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:33.240
getting completely different objects on our website anywhere from text boxes to patterns to color pictures
94

95
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:39.150
and a myriad array of different things that we can create just by changing that type.
95

96
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:45.060
Now aside from just the text and submit input types if you have a look at the MDN docs you'll see that
96

97
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:50.370
there's loads more different keywords that you can use for example the input type where you allow the
97

98
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:58.110
user to upload a file or the date picker or the radio button or a range and you can see that I've only
98

99
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.350
got static images in my slide to show you what they look like.
99

100
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:10.230
But I want you to look through the MDN documentation for the input HTML element, and I want you to create
100

101
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:17.760
a new HTML file that you're going to put onto your desktop and you can open it in order to see it
101

102
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.170
live in action.
102

103
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.650
For example the date picker now works and my range can be toggled.
103

104
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.840
I can switch my radio button on I can choose a file and a whole bunch of things.
104

105
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.860
So use it as a living notebook if you will.
105

106
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.730
So that should have been really easy.
106

107
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:39.380
And just to quickly show you this is what you could have created in order to achieve this.
107

108
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:46.590
Now at the moment we're not yet looking into the other attributes for our form or for our inputs and
108

109
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:55.290
we're only changing the type attribute to some of these predefined keywords that you can see are listed
109

110
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.590
on the MDN developer docs.
110

111
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:05.130
Now in order for us to use and understand the other attributes we'll need to learn a little bit of Javascript
111

112
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:05.790
first.
112

113
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.030
So we'll leave those other attributes until a little bit later on.
113

114
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:17.230
Now in the next lesson we're going to continue setting up our form on our contact me page so I'll see
114

115
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.690
you there.
