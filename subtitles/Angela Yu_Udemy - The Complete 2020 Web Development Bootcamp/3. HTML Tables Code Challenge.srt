00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,750
So now that we've got Books and Teaching or Education and Work Experience listed in chronological order,
1

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,200
the next thing that might be nice to add are listing some of the skills that you have.
2

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:22,080
So I want you, as a challenge, to create a table where you've got an h3 for the skills subtitle and then
3

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:29,340
you've got all your skills listed in a column on the left and on the right you've got some rows where
4

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:37,740
you've listed using emojis to show how familiar you are with each skill ranging from five stars to
5

6
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,090
one star.
6

7
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,480
Once you're done you should have a web site that looks something like this.
7

8
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:50,520
So you've got your h3 as a subtitle and then you've got a table that lists your skills as well
8

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,250
as the number of stars that you would rate yourself, and to get bonus points
9

10
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:01,170
you can also use tables to affect the layout of your skills, so you end up separating your skills into
10

11
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,510
two columns and making it look a little bit like this.
11

12
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,990
And this is what you should end up with.
12

13
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,480
Or rather this is what you're aiming for.
13

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:16,110
So I've added an extra skill so that we have four skills and they are laid out side by side so that
14

15
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:23,820
there's two columns of these skill sets and it's really important to note these two sections should
15

16
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,800
be distinct from each other.
16

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,070
So if you added a 1 pixel border,
17

18
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,540
this the structure that you will see - two sets of skills side by side distinct from each other.
18

19
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,120
So if you want to give that challenge a go,
19

20
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,780
then this is a good time to pause the video and give it a try.
