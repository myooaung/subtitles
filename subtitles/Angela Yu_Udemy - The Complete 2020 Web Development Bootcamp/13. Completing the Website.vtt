00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.510
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.290
So our code is now a lot more modular
2

3
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.350
and much more readable because we've implemented a better structure.
3

4
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.800
So for example, our HTML broad stroke web page wide styles are up here,
4

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.240
and then we've got our headings,
5

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.370
classes, our sections classes, our navigation bar
6

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.780
classes, our buttons, titles section, features, and it's now a lot easier,
7

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.290
say if something goes wrong in our code, to try and figure out the part of the code that's causing the
8

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.050
problem.
9

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.710
So you could further refactor this, although there really is a sweet spot before you start, you know, getting
10

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.440
rid of all your code and trying to mush it all together into a single giant class which doesn't really
11

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.160
work either.
12

13
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.760
So just because something repeats itself isn't itself a good enough reason for you to try and get rid
13

14
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.230
of it.
14

15
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.900
So even though we have for example the price-text that has a font-size of 3rem and line-height
15

16
00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.280
of 1.5 and also the testimonial-text also has the same dimensions,
16

17
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.230
it's not necessarily a good enough reason to simply bunch them together into a single class, because
17

18
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.070
even though, you know, in our case we've kind of kept them the same,
18

19
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.190
in reality it's probably not likely that you're going to have exactly the same styles applied to many
19

20
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.630
bits of your web page that are not really related,
20

21
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.930
right?
21

22
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.890
The testimonial-text and the pricing-text,
22

23
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.230
it's just a pure coincidence, or rather partly laziness on my part to keep them styled exactly the same.
23

24
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.170
In reality it's probably not going to be. So
24

25
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.450
our web site is now complete.
25

26
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.710
Now of course the href for these buttons etc. and your social icons are not working at all,
26

27
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.260
because we don't really have anywhere to point people to.
27

28
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.050
But if you did have a web site then you can already see how you now have the skills and the tools and
28

29
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.650
the know how to build a fantastic looking web site yourself using Bootstrap and CSS and HTML.
29

30
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.850
So I hope you had fun with me in this module and in the next module we've got even more exciting things
30

31
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.760
yet to come for you
31

32
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.800
because we're going to learn about Javascript.
32

33
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.380
So not only are we going to have style but we're also going to have a functionality. And this is really
33

34
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.190
where the real fun starts, because we can start making our web site do things by using some real code
34

35
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.340
and not just HTML and CSS.
35

36
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.010
So I'm really excited to see you on the next module and I hope you will be too.
36

37
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.330
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next module.
