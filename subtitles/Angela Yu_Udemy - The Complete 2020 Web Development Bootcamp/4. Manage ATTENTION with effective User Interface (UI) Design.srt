1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,410
So now that we've talked about some of the fundamentals of design like Color Theory and Typography, the
1

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,790
next thing I want to talk about is User Interface Design.
2

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,340
Now take a look at this picture.
3

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,200
In most cases, 99% of you would have read "YOUR EYE HERE" first, "then here" then
4

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,360
"Isn't that fascinating?"
5

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,620
So this is just a way that our brains work.
6

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,560
We're always drawn to the bigger bolder square of things.
7

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:39,450
And As designers, we can use this knowledge to define hierarchy. So let's say that you were to write a
8

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,770
birthday invites to Jane.
9

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,340
You could write it like this. But all of the information has equal weighting.
10

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,060
So as a reader, I have to go through the entire paragraph and I can't just skim through it to get the
11

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,470
important bits.
12

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,300
So it's gonna take me a lot longer
13

14
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:04,980
right? Now on the other hand if I apply the rules of hierarchy then the most important information gets
14

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:12,420
conveyed over first and I make sure that Jane actually knows whose birthday party it is, where it is
15

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,570
and when they should go.
16

17
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,000
So we can establish hierarchy in a number of ways.
17

18
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,930
The most obvious is through the use of color.
18

19
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:29,400
So colors that really pop and stand out and have contrast with that background tend to be used for high
19

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,640
hierarchy.
20

21
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:37,100
So for example in this case if all the colors were the same, then it feels like they all have equal importance.
21

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,110
But on the other hand, if we have something that's very bright very standoutish versus something that's
22

23
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:50,370
a bit more grade, a bit more muted, then we know exactly where our eyes will go to first.
23

24
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,880
Now if you take a look at this example this is the ASOS website. And their predominant color palette
24

25
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:03,570
is the sort of gray and white color. But they've really cleverly used their accent tone, this green and
25

26
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,560
red, to really tell the user what they think you should really look at.
26

27
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,860
And it seems like ASOS really cares that you know that they have an outlet and also that you add your
27

28
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,250
product to the bag so that they can actually make money off you.
28

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,850
So, in this case, they're using that green accent tone to really pull the eyes to that button and make sure
29

30
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:30,430
that the user actually completes their transaction. Now in addition to color, you should also think about
30

31
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,460
size because as I said, the bigger items often draw your eyes to it.
31

32
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,740
So, for example, if you look at the Coinbase website which you can use to buy cryptocurrency, we can see
32

33
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,740
the first thing they want to tell you is you can use this website to buy and sell cryptocurrency.
33

34
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:55,960
Now the next biggest thing on the page is this huge email input and a button that says "Get started".
34

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:02,570
So because a lot of these companies run ads and they're paying for users to land on their page, it's really
35

36
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,630
important for them to capture the emails.
36

37
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,930
This is kind of what this design is representing
37

38
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,760
right?
38

39
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,560
As long as you land on this page, you're probably going to want to look at this place where you put in
39

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,380
your email address and get started so that the company can capture your information.
40

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,970
Now in addition to establishing hierarchy in terms of user interface, you should think about the layout
41

42
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,460
of your website.
42

43
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,710
You can of course, on one hand, have this big block of text which is just your website where everything
43

44
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,040
is all laid out in the same kind of way
44

45
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,970
or you can create more interest by creating a block of text and then interspersed with pictures and
45

46
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,160
then create some different sizes and different shapes and different hierarchies to make your design
46

47
00:03:52,160 --> 00:04:02,820
look more interesting. Now the Wikipedia pages are a example in bad design because just look at how bland
47

48
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,300
it looks.
48

49
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,760
It really is trying to be an encyclopedia but it doesn't have to be like this. Now
49

50
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,600
one of the most noticeable things about Wikipedia is just the length of each block of text.
50

51
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,870
Just look at how long each line of text is.
51

52
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:24,830
It's very hard for a user to keep their eyes tracking along the same line.
52

53
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:32,250
And in fact, in terms of user interface design, there's an optimal line length. Too long and it gets a
53

54
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,870
little bit tedious to read. But too short it feels a bit too choppy and it's a bit awkward to read.
54

55
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,940
So you want to aim for something around 40 to 60 characters per line so that it feels comfortable to
55

56
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,910
the user and they'll be able to get through the information and still be interested in your website.
56

57
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:58,850
Now when you have good layout like Grammarly's website, it's not only interesting but it also chops
57

58
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,880
up the content into smaller pieces so that you actually get through more of the website and you take
58

59
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,050
more of it in.
59

60
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,610
Now another thing I want to talk about is alignment.
60

61
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:17,360
This has to do with how you position each of the elements on the screen relative to each other.
61

62
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,200
So take a look at the example on the left. The top title is center-aligned whereas the body text is
62

63
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,370
left-aligned. And it makes it look a little bit awkward like they're not really meant to be together.
63

64
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:38,000
Now on the right however just by shifting the alignment so that both starting points are the same for
64

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,410
the title and the body, it suddenly looks a lot more consistent and a lot more designed.
65

66
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,960
Now one of the easiest ways of making any sort of design you create look professional is just to reduce
66

67
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,780
the number of alignment points.
67

68
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:59,840
So let's say that you're creating a slide deck for your next presentation or you're creating a poster
68

69
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,680
for your birthday party,
69

70
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:09,290
take a look at all the things that are on the design and identify a line which goes through the beginning
70

71
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,870
of each item.
71

72
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,240
Now if you can reduce the number of lines like we have done here on the right then suddenly the design
72

73
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,490
looks a lot more coherent like all the pieces are meant to be together.
73

74
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,100
And it just looks a lot more professional.
74

75
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:31,400
So use these grid lines in your designed to help you visualize where the starting points of each element
75

76
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,490
is and try to line them all up.
76

77
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:40,490
Because even if you do nothing else but just alignment, you can see in this case the left looks a lot
77

78
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:47,780
more sloppy and the right looks a lot more designed and more professional. And all that's changed, there's
78

79
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:54,950
no change in the color, there's no change in typography, it's just the alignment. Now a really important
79

80
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:03,630
concept in all design is White Space. And white space refers to the empty space that's around text or round
80

81
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,210
your elements.
81

82
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:12,230
Now sometimes when I'm on the high street I come across one of these luxury handbag or shoe shops and
82

83
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,580
I look through the window.
83

84
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,540
Now here's an experiment.
84

85
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,780
Take a look at this shop that sells handbags and take a look at this one.
85

86
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,790
Now how much are you willing to pay for a handbag from this shop versus this one.
86

87
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,330
Now this is really a use case for white space.
87

88
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,030
A lot of luxury shops, luxury designer stores,
88

89
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:53,850
one of their simplest tools is just injecting white space around their products, space things out and it
89

90
00:07:53,850 --> 00:08:00,690
makes everything suddenly look a lot more expensive. Whereas when you have everything all tightly crammed
90

91
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,120
together and you have a lot of product on show, it makes it look like it's some sort of discount store.
91

92
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,030
And the same principle applies when it comes to digital design as well.
92

93
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,290
Let's say you have an ad for noise cancelling headphones.
93

94
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:21,490
If you have loads of things on screen, there's "New", "Only $20", "100% noise cancellation".
94

95
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:28,590
It makes the product look really cheap. Whereas if you injected some white space, all of a sudden it looks
95

96
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:35,370
like Apple made it right? Just by adding that space around each element on the screen
96

97
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,090
you can make your design a lot more minimalist and at the same time elevate it.
97

98
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,650
Now the last thing on User Interface design I want to talk about and probably the most important is
98

99
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,170
design for your audience.
99

100
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,110
A lot of things I've said, including not using comic-sans,
100

101
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,830
it really depends on your audience.
101

102
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,810
Let's say you're designing a children's concert poster, the one on the right looks like something that
102

103
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:06,530
children might actually want to go to. The one on the left looks a bit like a funeral advertisement.
103

104
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:15,030
It's so serious. It's so black and white and it's so severe looking that no child is kind of want to
104

105
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,290
go to that concert.
105

106
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,360
So think about your audience.
106

107
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,380
Think about what would appeal to them and what's important to convey to them. That it's going to be a
107

108
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:32,530
fun concert or that it's going to be boring adults who are going to be reading newspapers and some sort
108

109
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,480
of classical band in the background. When you're designing websites design it for your audience even
109

110
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,940
if it's something a little bit messier, a little bit bolder in terms of color, as long as it fits your
110

111
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,360
audience and that's perfectly fine.
111

112
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:54,300
So have the flexibility in your design so that you're not just creating one style all the time. You're
112

113
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,870
creating one style for a particular audience like teenagers who want to buy clothes and you're creating
113

114
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,990
a different style for people who want to buy and sell cryptocurrency or have a medical website.
114

115
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:14,100
So the flexibility in your design skills is really important when it comes to User Interface design.
115

116
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:22,350
But keep in mind those five things: hierarchy, layout, alignment, white space and your audience and you'll
116

117
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,420
be well on the way to creating more beautiful user interfaces for your websites.
