Hey there.
1

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.960
You've completed yet another module.
2

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.870
And that last one had a really difficult challenge.
3

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.850
So if you managed to get through this far, then you really really do deserve a pat on the back.
4

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.670
Now I want to share with you one of the things that I've noticed among students I've taught in person
5

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:28.740
and it usually happens just about this kind of time where you are right now. And, the thing is, you start
6

7
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.720
feeling like, well, you know, when I'm watching the tutorials everything makes perfect sense,
7

8
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.700
like I totally get it.
8

9
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.450
But when I have to do something myself, like in the challenge, all of a sudden it's like I've learned
9

10
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.260
nothing at all.
10

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.300
It's like I can't do it.
11

12
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.930
So what's actually going on there?
12

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:59.640
Well, you know, now one of the biggest problems is that when we're just watching things and we're
13

14
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.760
sort of following along with it, it's very easy to think,
14

15
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.110
yeah, yeah, I get that,
15

16
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.530
that’s fine. But when you actually have to do something yourself, when you actually have to put it into
16

17
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:19.680
practice, to solve a challenge or to build your own project, then all of a sudden you're using completely
17

18
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.230
different skills, right?
18

19
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.330
And you have to be able to conjure up how to do things and pull it out of your brain, which is very different
19

20
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.630
from just absorbing things in.
20

21
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:42.930
So one of the ways of combating this is to constantly do the pulling out, the retrieving of information,
21

22
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.140
the retrieving of your skill. Try to practice as much as you can.
22

23
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.020
Try to look up exercises around the Internet or try to make up questions for yourself, quizzes for yourself.
23

24
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.610
Test yourself on variations of what you've done in the tutorials, or even better, anticipate what the
24

25
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.100
tutorial is about to do
25

26
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.320
and then just do it beforehand.
26

27
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.260
Pause the video before I actually show you how to do something.
27

28
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.350
Once you know what needs to be done, see if you can do it yourself.
28

29
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.240
That is fundamentally different from actually just listening to me, because, you know, we can all sit and
29

30
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.640
listen to lectures all day long, but if we're not focused, if we're not using the skills we're learning,
30

31
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.390
then it's as if we haven't learned at all.
31

32
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.750
So if you do more of this I promise things will become more within your reach and you will feel like
32

33
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.720
you have a better grasp of the skills than if you had just sat and listened without trying it out.
33

34
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.040
So have a go of that and keep going in the course. You’re getting really far and I’m really really proud
34

35
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.860
of what you're able to do now.
