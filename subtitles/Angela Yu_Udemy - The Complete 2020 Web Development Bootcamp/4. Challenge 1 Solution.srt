1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,570
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,630
So here comes the answer to challenge 1.
2

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,730
If you've already completed challenge 1 and you just want to see how it's done then continue watching
3

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,500
the video.
4

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,820
If you've gone through all of the hints and you're still stuck and you really don't know what to do
5

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,420
then also keep playing and I'll show you the answer.
6

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:24,460
But if you still want to keep trying then pause the video before I reveal the answer.
7

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,470
All right here we go.
8

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,050
So inside our home.
9

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:27,610
ejs,
10

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,510
we're going to create that h1 that just says home. And then we're going to go into our app.js
11

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,130
which is our server code to try and render that page.
12

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,760
And the route that we're going to target is going to be the home route.
13

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:46,440
So we're going to say app.get and we're going to target the home route or the root route.
14

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,590
That's the one that's just the /.
15

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:55,140
And then we're going to put in a callback function with our req and res as per usual.
16

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,790
And then inside this function is where we're going to render our home.ejs.
17

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:08,790
And if you remember the method for that using Express is res.render and then we specify what it is
18

19
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,070
that we want to render.
19

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:16,830
And remember the page that we want to render has to be something.ejs and it has to be inside a folder
20

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,800
called views in the root of our main project folder
21

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,550
in the same hierarchical level as app.js.
22

23
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,230
Now the page that we want to render in this case is home.ejs
23

24
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:37,140
so all we have to specify is the string home inside a set of quotation marks. And then we'll close everything
24

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,180
off with some semi-colons.
25

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,230
So now if we hit Save and we make sure that we're inside our ejs-challenge folder then we're going
26

27
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:54,020
to use nodemon  to start our app.js and run our server. So service starts on port 3000
27

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,700
I'm going to head over to localhost:3000
28

29
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:02,530
and this is how we achieve the goal for Challenge 1.
29

30
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,280
Now if you manage to get here without needing any of the hints then that's a huge pat on the back and
30

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,710
a gold star for you.
31

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,460
Now if you needed to have a look at a few of the hints then that's fine as well.
32

33
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,860
See if in the coming challenges you can reduce the number of hints you need and rely more on Sstack Overflow
33

34
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,910
or Google to achieve what it is that you want instead of looking at the hints or the answers. And only
34

35
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,690
use them when you're well and truly stuck and you can't move forwards without watching a hint or two.
35

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,140
So that's all for challenge 1. In the next video we're going to head over to the next challenge.
