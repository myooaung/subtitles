0
1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,980
So the first thing you're going to do is open up your Hyper Terminal.
1

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,400
So the first thing that you might notice is that my preferences or my display or the skin on my terminal
2

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,280
might look different from yours.
3

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,480
Now I have it this green on black,
4

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,180
just because I do a lot of development at night and it helps my eyes and it helps me going to sleep
5

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,210
afterwards.
6

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,170
And also there's the added benefit of when you're sitting in Starbucks and doing a lot of Bash scripting,
7

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,470
people look at you really funny, like you're going to hack into their phone or something.
8

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,570
And if you really want to take it to the extreme, and you've never seen this web site called hackertyper.com,
9

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,990
you can actually pull it up on your browser and you can basically just bash the keys
10

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,130
and you look like you're writing some insane piece of code.
11

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,680
This is actually part of the Linux kernel, in case anybody's interested,
12

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,200
and it's written in the C programming language, so that also is something that you can impress your friends.
13

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,050
Now coming back to our actual lesson let's talk about the first command that we're going to learn today
14

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:15,360
which is ls, which stands for list, and this lists all the items inside a particular directory. So you
15

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,000
can see the location of where you are by whatever shows up after the colon.
16

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,380
So at the moment this tilde shows me that I’m in my user directory. So that, in the Finder world, is basically
17

18
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,120
here.
18

19
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,240
So for example if we go back.
19

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,110
So the root or the highest level in the hierarchy is your Macintosh HD.
20

21
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,720
And then the next one is your Users folder.
21

22
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,400
And on this computer my user name is angelayu.
22

23
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:53,380
And when you see that tilde sign, you are at this level, you are inside this folder right now.
23

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:00,000
So if I wanted to list all the items that are inside that folder then I simply write the ls command and
24

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,920
hit enter.
25

26
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,230
You can see it prints out all of the folders and files.
26

27
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:10,740
So I've only got folders inside my root directory and you can see that it’s exactly the same as what you
27

28
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,810
see in Finder.
28

29
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,590
Now this is the location that you are taken to by default
29

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,910
when you open up your terminal.
30

31
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,260
This is the starting point.
31

32
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,800
Now what if you don't want to be inside this folder?
32

33
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,810
What if you want to navigate to a different directory,
33

34
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,220
right?
34

35
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:34,110
Say for example if I wanted to go into my Documents, and I want to go into Learn, and I've got this folder
35

36
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,730
called Languages.
36

37
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,490
And right now I'm learning German and the International Phonetic Alphabet in case anybody's interested.
37

38
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:47,490
So how do I get myself from here all the way inside here?
38

39
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,760
Well this is where the change directory, or the cd command, comes in handy.
39

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,420
So we know that we are here right now because of the tilde sign.
40

41
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,420
Let's navigate one level down.
41

42
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,570
Let's go into our Documents folder. So I can simply write cd Documents.
42

43
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,390
Now I can type out the entire thing myself but as a developer we're always looking for lazier ways of
43

44
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,590
doing things and faster ways of doing things.
44

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,620
So if you start typing Doc and you hit tab you can see that the terminal will auto fill the remainder
45

46
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,360
of your folder name.
46

47
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,540
Now you need enough letters for it to know what you're talking about.
47

48
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,280
So for example if I just wrote Do, then it will tell me that there's Documents and Download.
48

49
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,710
Which one do I want?
49

50
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:41,980
So if I add a w and then I hit tab, then it knows that it can only be Downloads for example.
50

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,240
Okay.
51

52
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,530
So let's change directory to Documents, and you can see that the location has changed.
52

53
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,280
This directory name after the colon is now saying Documents.
53

54
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,030
So that means I am currently inside here. I am at this level.
54

55
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,530
So if I wanted to go into this level, I would have to navigate into the Learn folder.
55

56
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,970
So if you're following along, what would you type?
56

57
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,430
Give it a go.
57

58
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,410
Similar as what we did before we’re simply writing cd Learn and hit enter.
58

59
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:23,130
So now we're inside Learn. Now it's a little bit tedious to navigate through directories one by one by
59

60
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,550
one,
60

61
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:23,850
right?
61

62
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,880
So if we already knew that we want to go all the way into here then we can actually specify the entire
62

63
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,380
path to get there.
63

64
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,570
So for example right now I'm inside Learn.
64

65
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:45,590
So let's go back to our root. So I can say cd tilde and hit enter and now I'm back at my root directory
65

66
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,720
which is here.
66

67
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,750
So let’s map out the path that I need in order to get to here.
67

68
00:04:51,890 --> 00:05:01,220
I need to go into Documents and then Learn and then Languages. So I can simply write cd Documents/Learn/
68

69
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,980
Languages/.
69

70
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:11,450
And now if I hit enter I am inside Languages, which is over here. And that's a lot more succinct and a
70

71
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:19,520
lot quicker than going through the directories one by one. Another really time saving feature of Terminal
71

72
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,430
is the up and down buttons.
72

73
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,080
So if you wanted to use the last command that you typed all you have to do is just hit the up button
73

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,880
and you can see that I can use that change directory command again.
74

75
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,180
But in my case I actually want to use the ls command.
75

76
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,160
So obviously it's easier to simply type out ls rather than cycling through all those.
76

77
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,180
But I just want to show you that you can actually go through your entire history of previous commands
77

78
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:50,760
and you can then hit enter to execute it, and you can see that inside the Languages folder
78

79
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:59,390
I have two other folders called German and IPA. So you can tell that we are at this level in our directory.
79

80
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:05,460
Now sometimes typing out an entire path like this might seem like it's a lot of work.
80

81
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,490
So I want to show you another neat trick that you can use when you have the Finder open and you just
81

82
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,900
want to navigate to a deep directory without having to type out the entire path.
82

83
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,770
So let's cd
83

84
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,000
back to here,
84

85
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,260
to our root directory for your user.
85

86
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,250
So do you know how to do that? If you do, go ahead and do it now.
86

87
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,790
So I'm going to cycle back and I found it.
87

88
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,330
It's the cd tilde.
88

89
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,630
And if I hit enter I am now back at my user’s root directory.
89

90
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:41,180
Now once we're inside this Languages folder, how do we change directory back to the parent folders?
90

91
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,500
How do we go backwards in this path?
91

92
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,670
We're still going to be using the change directory or the cd command, and then after a space we're simply
92

93
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,470
going to type two dots.
93

94
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,260
And this takes us back one level,
94

95
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,430
so from Languages I'm now in the Learn folder,
95

96
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:05,030
so I'm now here. And I can keep doing this until I'm back at my root directory right here.
96

97
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:10,080
So it took me three cd .. to get back to my roots.
97

98
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:19,130
And the reason why you might want to do this is because, say if I was inside the Languages folder, so
98

99
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,770
I'm now at the Languages directory, and I wanted to navigate
99

100
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:32,390
now to my Music directory for example. I can't simply write cd Music. That’s not going to work because
100

101
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,900
it's looking inside this Languages folder.
101

102
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,040
It's looking to go forwards.
102

103
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:44,480
So if I wanted to go backwards in the directory I either have to specify the entire file path,
103

104
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:55,250
so that would be cd /, which is my Macintosh HD, Users/angelayu/Music.
104

105
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:02,630
So I would have to specify the entire file path to go backwards and I can only specify just the name
105

106
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,420
of the folder if I'm going forwards in terms of this hierarchy.
106

107
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:15,110
Now what if I wanted to edit this at some point in the middle of this entire command? Because you can
107

108
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:22,820
see that if I click at any of these places it doesn't really do what you expect it to do in a graphical
108

109
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,910
user interface, right,
109

110
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:31,280
namely allowing you to edit these parts. Your cursor is here and you can only type where your cursor
110

111
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:39,290
is. So you can of course use the left arrow to go all the way back, but this is obviously very time consuming,
111

112
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,530
especially if your command is very long.
112

113
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,510
So a neat trick is holding down the option or the alt button and it gives you this little plus sign,
113

114
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:55,000
and now you can click on one point in your command and you can now move the cursor to that position.
114

115
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,080
So that's quite a neat trick as well.
115

116
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,460
Now for people who have come from a long history of using graphical user interfaces such as you know
116

117
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:11,990
your Mac OS or your Windows, having these little tricks like using the option click can be quite neat,
117

118
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:21,680
but if you are a puritanical command line user then ideally you're aiming for never having to touch
118

119
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,710
the mouse and you can do most things that you would want to do with the mouse very easily and quickly
119

120
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,930
just using your keyboard.
120

121
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:36,770
So for example if I wanted to go to the beginning of this line then I can simply hold down control and
121

122
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,520
press A,
122

123
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:44,570
so my cursor is now at the beginning. And if I hold down control and press E then I go to the end of my
123

124
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,820
command line.
124

125
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,840
Now you've already seen that I can cycle through my previous commands by using the up and down button.
125

126
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,640
But what if I wanted to clear this current command without executing it?
126

127
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:03,240
So to do that you can again hold down control and hit the U button, and that clears your entire line,
127

128
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,450
so you can write a new command.
128

129
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,150
So in the next lesson we're going to cover directories, making directories and secret folders.
129

130
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,380
So I will see you there.
