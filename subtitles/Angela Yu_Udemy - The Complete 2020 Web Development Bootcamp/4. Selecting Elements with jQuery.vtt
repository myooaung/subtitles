00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.920
Now the most basic thing we need to do when we're creating our web sites is to select the elements in
1

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.030
our web page in order to manipulate it at a later date.
2

3
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.210
Now we saw that we can do this in Javascript by saying something like document.querySelector
3

4
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.000
and inside here we would add the selector that we want to select,
4

5
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.740
right?
5

6
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.580
So for example if we wanted the h1 then we can simply say querySelector("h1").
6

7
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:36.020
Now if we were to write this in jQuery then we can remove all of this part and instead only have the
7

8
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.760
dollar sign which is short for jQuery.
8

9
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.540
So now we're using a jQuery method to select our h1, and you can see how much shorter it is.
9

10
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.750
Now this works very similarly to querySelector in the sense that inside the parentheses we're specifying
10

11
00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.010
the CSS selector that we would use if we were to select our elements in CSS.
11

12
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.420
And this is because it's the most flexible, the most adaptable, and also can be very specific.
12

13
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:16.370
So for example it allows us to say things like we want the h1 that has a class of title, or we want
13

14
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.890
the h1 that's nested inside a div with the id of header.
14

15
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.860
And that works exactly the same.
15

16
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.180
There's no changes there.
16

17
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.680
But what the querySelector allows us to do is when we're trying to select all of our buttons, if you
17

18
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.870
remember from previously, we had to say something like document.querySelectorAll, and then we
18

19
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.320
would select the button in here.
19

20
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:54.050
Now, with jQuery, the dollar sign again replaces all of this and it will select all of the buttons
20

21
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.690
on screen and there's no difference between selecting one or selecting many.
