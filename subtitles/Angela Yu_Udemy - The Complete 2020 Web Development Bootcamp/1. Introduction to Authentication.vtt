All right guys.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.450
Welcome to a brand new module.
2

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.980
And in this module we're going to tackle the topic of authentication. And it's something that is often
3

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.390
thought of as incredibly complicated but it doesn't have to be.
4

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.750
And we're going to take it step by step from beginning to end so that you get an overview of the entire
5

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.540
process of setting up authentication from scratch.
6

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.120
So why do we need to authenticate?
7

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.700
Well, as we're creating our website or web app for users to use then these users are going to start
8

9
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.700
generating data in the website.
9

10
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.210
They might like certain posts, they might interact with other users,
10

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.960
there might be messages created or recipes created.
11

12
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.820
There's always going to be some user data created. And in order to associate those pieces of data with
12

13
00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.360
individual users, we need to create an account for each user so that they would sign up to our website
13

14
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.110
using a username and password and we would essentially create kind of like an ID card for them to
14

15
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.120
uniquely identify them on our database and to save all of the data that they generate onto that account.
15

16
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.640
So the next time that they come back onto the website they'll be able to use their username and password
16

17
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.490
and log into our website and be able to access all of those possibly private pieces of information.
17

18
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.480
So this way you don't end up with everybody being able to see you know what private messages you're
18

19
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.670
sending around on Facebook or see your direct messages on Twitter.
19

20
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.330
So that's pretty simple.
20

21
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.390
Now the other reason why you might want to add authentication to your website is to restrict access
21

22
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.070
to certain areas of the website depending on the status of the user.
22

23
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.810
So for example if you were Spotify or Netflix and you charge a subscription for accessing certain parts
23

24
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.570
of the website then once the user pays, you have to update their account in your database to say that
24

25
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.800
they have paid and they'll be allowed to access the TV shows or songs that they're entitled to.
25

26
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.540
So those are some of the reasons why you might want to add authentication to your website. But authentication
26

27
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.030
can be done in a number of ways.
27

28
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.690
Creating a website where we sign up and login users seems simple enough but the difficult part of
28

29
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.290
authentication comes from how secure you're going to make your website.
29

30
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.680
And we're going to tackle this problem of authentication by going through the different levels of security.
30

31
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.000
So we're going to go from very basic creating an account, adding the user to our database, saving their
31

32
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.850
username and password to enable them to log in, all the way up to covering things such as OAuth and social
32

33
00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.710
logins including creating things such as sessions and cookies and hashing and encrypting passwords.
33

34
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.260
And it's going to be more than you'd ever want to know about this topic but it's really really important
34

35
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.990
that you learn it in the beginning because later on once you've understood and you've built authentication
35

36
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.290
from the bottom up then I'm going to show you some ways of simplifying and making your life easier
36

37
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.130
using third party libraries like Passport.
37

38
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.090
So we're going to learn how to progress from essentially a website that's basically secured with a
38

39
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.050
chito to something that is a lot more serious and more consistent with industry standards of good
39

40
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.670
security on a website.
40

41
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.130
So if you're not interested in learning how to authenticate users from the very basics all the way up
41

42
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.030
to the most complicated if you just want to skip ahead right to the end where we cover auth using third
42

43
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.840
party social loggins such as Google or Facebook, then feel free to do that.
43

44
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.130
But I strongly strongly recommend that you follow along the entire tutorial not only because there's
44

45
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.720
some pretty good jokes coming up
45

46
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.590
if I might say so myself, but also because it will help you build a foundation of knowledge around this
46

47
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.090
topic so that when you see it in the wild you won't be stumped.
47

48
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.540
So once you're ready we're going to get started building a website that keeps secrets.
48

49
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.640
Makes sense right? Authentication.
49

50
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.900
So there is a app called Whisper that you might have come across and it's a really simple concept basically
50

51
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:40.200
allows people to submit their secrets anonymously. So whatever  they post are not associated with a email
51

52
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.650
or a user name and it means that people can express themselves I guess more freely.
52

53
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.930
It's quite a fun website
53

54
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.680
and this is what we're going to try and replicate by the end of this module.
54

55
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.610
So the structure of our website is really really simple.
55

56
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:05.280
It has a home page which has two buttons that allows you to either go towards register or go towards
56

57
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.490
log in and once the user has been registered or logged in and they have been authenticated then they
57

58
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.600
are able to access the secrets page.
58

59
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.610
So I've kept the remainder of the website pretty simple because we're going to be focusing on a pretty
59

60
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.770
complex topic.
60

61
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.530
So I've created some starting files for you to download so that we can focus our efforts on learning
61

62
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.100
authentication and not get distracted by things like Bootstrap and styling.
62

63
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.380
So once you are ready, head over to the next lesson and download the starting files and then we're gonna get
63

64
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.060
started with our level 1 security authentication. So I'll see you there.
