00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,350
All right guys. In the last few modules we've covered a lot of stuff and it's really really important
1

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:07,950
stuff.
2

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,100
So it's time to challenge yourself and see if you've understood the concepts that were presented in
3

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,640
the last few modules.
4

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:24,840
So this module is the EJS challenge although it also relies on your knowledge and skills from the Express
5

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,920
module as well as everything that we've learned about Node.
6

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,980
Now this challenge is slightly different from previous challenges because we're now at a point where
7

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,740
you can create fully fledged Node.js backed websites.
8

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,010
We're going to take you to the next level.
9

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:50,310
So by the end of this module we would have made a beautiful personal blog or personal diary website
10

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,320
that would look like this.
11

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,970
So it's very minimalistic and it's got a header up here with a nav bar and your brand
12

13
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,290
and then at the bottom it's got a sticky footer
13

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,700
and you can put in your footer text.
14

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,810
And here we've only got three pages:
15

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,730
the home page, the about us page and also a contact us page. And all of this is going to be generated using
16

17
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,170
EJS partials,
17

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,820
so using those layouts that we learned about in the last module.
18

19
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,220
Now when you head over to the home page, this is going to have all of your blog posts on here listed
19

20
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:33,630
in chronological order but the actual blog content will be truncated to only 100 characters.
20

21
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:40,860
Now when you click on read more, it will take you to an individual page of each of your blog posts and
21

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,330
you can read them independently on a single page.
22

23
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:50,670
Now there's also a hidden page which will allow you to compose your diary.
23

24
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,030
So if we create a new post here
24

25
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,310
and let's just copy and paste some Loren Ipsum into the post and hit publish.
25

26
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,760
Then you can see it gets put right on the home page and a brand new page has been created just for that
26

27
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,470
new post. And now right in the URL
27

28
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,870
we can change this to something like /posts/another-post 
28

29
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:21,960
so the title of our new post that we created. And we hit enter and we get taken to the page where that blog
29

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,860
posts exists. So you can see by using EJS we're able to create dynamically single pages,
30

31
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,920
new web pages for each and every blog post that we're making.
31

32
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,180
And through the challenge you're going to realize just how easy it is to use templating to achieve this.
32

33
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,750
Now just before we get started, I want to show you what to expect in terms of the format of the challenges
33

34
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,650
because there is a pretty dramatic step up from the previous ones that you've attempted.
34

35
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,450
Now firstly you should complete the challenges in order because they are the steps that are required
35

36
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,350
to create the final product.
36

37
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,220
And when you view the challenge video, I'm first going to introduce to you what it is that I want you
37

38
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,470
to achieve by the end of the challenge,
38

39
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,300
so what is the goal of that particular challenge.
39

40
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,060
And then you can pause the video and try to complete the challenge.
40

41
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,960
But if you get stuck at any point and you really can't figure out how to proceed, instead of rewinding
41

42
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,560
back and watching previous modules videos, I want you to go ahead and press play on the video again which
42

43
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,430
will take you to a hint.
43

44
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,910
And this is where I'm going to give you a couple of hints that should help you complete the challenge.
44

45
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,150
And once you've gone through a hint, you should pause the video and head back to the challenge and 
45

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,310
give it another go.
46

47
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,460
Now if that hint wasn't enough there might be a second hint or a third hint.
47

48
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,250
So after each hint there is going to be 10 seconds for you to pause the video. So to complete the challenge
48

49
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,910
I want you to use as few hints as you possibly can but the ultimate goal is to complete the challenge
49

50
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,780
by yourself.
50

51
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,440
So if you find that you need more hints then just press play and watch the next hint and then pause
51

52
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,680
and try and see if that helps you with the challenge.
52

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,660
Now at some point you're going to see a red screen on the video and it's going to tell you that if you
53

54
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,820
proceed any further
54

55
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,980
this is basically the spoiler right?
55

56
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,440
This is where I'm going to reveal to you the answer to completing that challenge.
56

57
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:26,070
So if you don't want to see the answer before you've given a proper go at the challenge, then I recommend
57

58
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,780
you really pause and give the challenge at least an hour to try and see if you can figure it out.
58

59
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:38,460
Now in the resources of each lesson, you'll find a download link to the solution code.
59

60
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,550
So if after completing the challenge watching through all the hints and answers and your code still doesn't
60

61
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,370
seem to work the same way that you see on screen,
61

62
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:53,190
then you should download the completed code for that lesson and compare against yours to see whether
62

63
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,310
if you've made any typos or if you've created any bugs.
63

64
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:03,900
Now the point of these challenges is to test yourself and to break down a large problems such as creating
64

65
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:10,890
this web app into small chunks that you can tackle one by one. And it's really really important that
65

66
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,530
you promise me that you'll give it a real good go because this really is the way that you're going to
66

67
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,070
learn.
67

68
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,030
This is the part that's really going to take you from a student to an actual developer.
68

69
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,830
And I've put so much thought and heart and soul into creating these challenges so that they can benefit
69

70
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:35,580
you. So please please please give it a real good go before you go through to the next hint or to the
70

71
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,690
answer.
71

72
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,500
Now if you got through the challenge without looking at a single hint then you get a gold star.
72

73
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,000
Whereas if you had to look at one hint, then you get a silver and if you had to look at two hints then
73

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,500
you get a bronze.
74

75
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,590
But we've done a lot of research on this and we've tested this method on real students through many
75

76
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:02,130
many iterations and in person trials and this works fantastic as long as you have the perseverance
76

77
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,110
and the will to give it a go.
77

78
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,090
For the students who've gone through it, you'll realize just how fun and experience this is and how you
78

79
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,360
can really see your skill level grow through these challenges.
79

80
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,150
Now without further ado, if you head over to the next lesson we're going to get started with challenge
80

81
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,860
1.
