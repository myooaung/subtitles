00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.010
All right.
1

2
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.660
So as promised we're going to talk about how you can pick and mix your CSS selectors.
2

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.910
So one of my favorite childhood pastimes, picking and mixing sweets, until the dentist told me to stop,
3

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.320
otherwise he's going to pull out all my teeth.
4

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.560
So, dental horrors aside, let's talk about how you can combine different CSS selectors in order to apply
5

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.980
styles more specifically.
6

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.320
Now the first type is the easiest to understand and we've seen this when we combined all of our different
7

8
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.710
heading types, h1 through to h6, and applied the font-family Montserrat-Bold to all of these HTML
8

9
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.840
elements on our web page.
9

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.030
So the idea here is that you write one selector, you add a comma and then a space, and then the next selector.
10

11
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.270
So the space in this case is actually optional but it's quite nice to space it up just so that you can
11

12
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.910
see it more clearly.
12

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.200
But, later on, as we'll see in other cases, the spacing is really important, but when you're combining multiple
13

14
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.690
selectors it's not a big deal.
14

15
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.180
So selector1, selector2.
15

16
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.870
That's a good style to follow.
16

17
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.900
Now, the way that it works is, say that we have an h1 and a paragraph, and we want to apply the same color
17

18
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.660
to the text in both cases.
18

19
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.470
Then we can either write out you know this long winded approach of h1 color red, p color red, or we
19

20
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.910
can simply combine it by writing h1, p.
20

21
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.150
And in this case we're applying the color red to both of these elements.
21

22
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.110
And this is just a way of shortening your code and grouping similar things together.
22

23
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.150
You're going to see this most commonly at the HTML element level, and it's mostly for things like h1 through
23

24
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.000
to h6.
24

25
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.730
But this is very very simple.
25

26
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.320
Now it gets a little bit more complicated when we start talking about hierarchical selectors, and that's
26

27
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.480
because in order to use this properly we have to understand how the HTML is structured.
27

28
00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:01.740
So in our case we wrote this code that targeted the container-fluid class that is inside something that
28

29
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.050
has the id of title, and we gave it a different padding.
29

30
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.580
The syntax here looks like this.
30

31
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.820
So you have selector1, then you have a space then you have selector2.
31

32
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.410
And this is what I was talking about earlier on. Spacing
32

33
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.670
in this case is crucial.
33

34
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.740
You should have one space and the order is that the first selector is from the parent and the second selector
34

35
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.580
is from the child.
35

36
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.910
So let's take a look at this in more detail so that we can really get to grips with it.
36

37
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.520
So in this case I've got a div that has a class of container-fluid,
37

38
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.480
and I also have an h1 that has the id of title.
38

39
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.770
So if we had some code that was written like this then this is a hierarchical combination of selectors.
39

40
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.470
So you would read this from right to left.
40

41
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.690
And so does the browser.
41

42
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.750
So it's good to look for all of the h1s that are contained inside a div.
42

43
00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.480
So in this case it would work and it would change the text color to red because our h1 is indeed
43

44
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.460
contained inside a div.
44

45
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.460
But you might realize that this is very very broad.
45

46
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.610
All of your h1s that are inside a div is going to be colored red.
46

47
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.250
So you might want to make it a little bit more specific.
47

48
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.570
Say in this case we're saying that the element that has an id of title that is contained inside a parent
48

49
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.990
with the class container-fluid should have the text color of red.
49

50
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.250
Now this is a lot more specific because firstly you're only going to have one id that is going to be
50

51
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.590
title on your whole page.
51

52
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.260
And by using the class of the parent you're also getting very very specific.
52

53
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.850
Now in this case this is actually kind of redundant code because if you wanted to apply this style to
53

54
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.420
an element with an id of title, as we said before, ids have to be unique across the page, so there can only
54

55
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.660
be one thing with the id that is title.
55

56
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.470
So you would never write this code, you would simply just target the id title,
56

57
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.810
right? But this is probably the most legitimate code that you will see.
57

58
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.630
So in this case we're saying that all the h1s on the web page that is the child of an element with
58

59
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:18.060
the class container-fluid should be colored red. And this is a very specific way of applying styles to
59

60
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.760
a particular element inside your web page.
60

61
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.800
And this allows you to really drill down your CSS, because you're not applying your styles to all the
61

62
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:33.750
h1, but instead you're saying that only the h1s that are inside a parent that has the class container-
62

63
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.830
fluid should have this style.
63

64
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.870
Now it's really important to remember that you should read the hierarchy from the right to the left.
64

65
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:51.330
So in this case it's the element that has a class of title that is inside a parent that is a div that
65

66
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.560
should have the color red. The one on the right is the child, the one on the left is the parent.
66

67
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:04.730
And this syntax will only work in a parent child situation. You can't have, for example, a div that has
67

68
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.850
the class of title and you're trying to use this syntax.
68

69
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.440
It just simply won't work.
69

70
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.950
Something has to be contained in something else. Something has to be a child of something else
70

71
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.390
for this type of hierarchical syntax to work.
71

72
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:24.530
Now the last type of combination I'm going to talk about are when you simply combine selectors, and in this
72

73
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.830
case that space is gone.
73

74
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.750
There is no space between your two selectors that you're combining and you can see something like this
74

75
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.780
so an HTML element combined with a class, or it could be an HTML element combined with a id,
75

76
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.280
it doesn't really matter.
76

77
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.980
But they have to all occur in the same element.
77

78
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:52.580
So in this case if I tried to change the color of the Hello World and I wanted to combine my selectors,
78

79
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.390
I would say something like the h1 that has an id of title should have the color red, and this is how
79

80
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.690
you should read the syntax. When there is no space you're reading from left to right. When there is space
80

81
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.350
then it's hierarchical and you're reading from right to left.
81

82
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.600
So it's a little bit confusing but you'll get used to it once you start applying it and using it yourself.
82

83
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.350
So it doesn't matter if it's an id or if it's a class that's being combined with an HTML element, that
83

84
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.970
doesn't matter at all.
84

85
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.010
And as long as there's no space between your two selectors it will work just fine.
85

86
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.800
So in this case we're saying that the div that has a class of container-fluid should have the text color
86

87
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.480
of red being applied to all of its content.
87

88
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:41.920
But this doesn't work if you're saying that the div with an id of title should have the text color red.
88

89
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:49.610
This is not valid code because currently on screen we don't have a single div that has the id of title.
89

90
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.490
We only have a div that has a child with the id of title and this doesn't work.
90

91
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.370
We're going to have to use a hierarchical selector if you want to do something like this.
91

92
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:04.820
So at this point a lot of students will ask, well what exactly is the difference between the one where
92

93
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.350
you have a space between two selectors and the one where there is no space?
93

94
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:15.990
So I've got this bit of HTML here that I've pre written to save you the boredom of having to watch me type.
94

95
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:22.910
But essentially we've got a div that has a class of container and it contains an h1 that has the class
95

96
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.030
of title and it says Hello World.
96

97
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.950
Then we have another div that has the class of container-fluid and it has an h1
97

98
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.220
with the class title as well.
98

99
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:39.220
Now I've removed all traces of Bootstrap from this Code Ply because it's not important.
99

100
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.500
I want to show you that what we're doing here,
100

101
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.570
this is just pure CSS.
101

102
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.780
It's not related to the Bootstrap classes or the framework at all.
102

103
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.910
This is just CSS knowledge that we're learning here.
103

104
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:59.540
So what if I wanted to apply some CSS styles in order to color the Hello World in red? What would I
104

105
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.260
need to do?
105

106
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:08.300
Well, unless I was willing to change the HTML, there is no way of applying a style selectively to this
106

107
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:15.050
Hello World and not the Good Bye World without combining our, selectors because, for example, if I said, let's
107

108
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:21.770
target the h1s and change the text color to red, then it's going to change both of the h1s.
108

109
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.820
And this is the same if I try to use their class which is title as well,
109

110
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.350
right?
110

111
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:34.940
So I would need to combine my selectors and in this case the difference between these two titles is
111

112
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:40.680
just that they're contained in different divs or divs with different classes rather.
112

113
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:48.710
So I can use that fact to structure my CSS code. So I can say, for example, the text that has a class
113

114
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:58.880
of title that's inside an element that has the class container should have this color red applied
114

115
00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:59.890
to it.
115

116
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.310
So remember we're reading always from right to left.
116

117
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:09.740
So we're saying that an element with a class called title that's inside an element with a class called
117

118
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.340
container should have this style applied.
118

119
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:20.090
So let's hit run and you can see that we've managed to isolate the Hello World from the Good Bye World
119

120
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.880
simply by using hierarchical selectors.
120

121
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:32.990
Now if I delete that space there, this code will no longer work, because what this now reads is, look for
121

122
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:40.250
an element inside the HTML that has a class of container but also a class of title.
122

123
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:45.920
So essentially what you're saying here is you're saying that it is an h1 that has two classes and
123

124
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.080
it looks like this.
124

125
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:53.090
So that is what this code is saying. When you're combining code together with no spaces,
125

126
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.690
all of the selectors have to be within the same HTML element.
126

127
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:05.400
So, you could say, an h1 that has a class of container and also a class of title should have this
127

128
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:05.780
style.
128

129
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.080
And when I run the code you can see this still works exactly the same.
129

130
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.360
But this has no parent or child relationship at all.
130

131
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.870
And you would be targeting two classes in the same element.
131

132
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.500
But when you do combine selectors like this it doesn't really matter if you're combining classes with
132

133
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.540
ids or ids with HTML elements.
133

134
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.880
So let's give this an id.
134

135
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:34.060
Let's call this heading, and let's change our class back to title and hit run.
135

136
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:44.400
And now I'm able to change the h1 by saying h1#heading. This will target an h1 that
136

137
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.670
has an id of heading and that is of course our Hello World.
137

138
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:57.840
I can also say h1.title, but this now targets all the h1s that have a class of title, and that
138

139
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.280
is both Hello and Good Bye.
139

140
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:06.760
So I hope that illustrates a common confusion point which is space versus no space,
140

141
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.720
and what is the difference between a hierarchical and a simple combo.

142
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.800
So this takes a little bit of time to really sink in,
142

143
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:22.500
and I really urge you to build your own code playground and mess with your code to try and target specific
143

144
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:28.070
things without having to add in more custom classes into your HTML,
144

145
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:33.180
so try to use combinations instead of adding new classes that you can target.
145

146
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.130
So have a play around with that and in the next lesson we're going to get back to refactoring our code
146

147
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.310
so that we can finish off our web site.
147

148
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.310
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
