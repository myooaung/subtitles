All right time for the answer. See if you got it right.
1

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.950
So inside our home.ejs we know that we need to render a paragraph element. Inside the paragraph
2

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.580
element is where we're going to pass over a variable and we're going to render the content or the value of
3

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.990
that variable into the paragraph.
4

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.300
So in order to get the value of the variable we use the  EJS tag that is angle bracket percentage
5

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.410
sign equals and then the name of the variable which we'll just call starting content. And then to close
6

7
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.580
off the tag we add another percentage sign and angle bracket.
7

8
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:46.950
So now we can hit save over here and we can go back to our get route and inside the res.render method
8

9
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.900
instead of just simply rendering the home.ejs page,
9

10
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.350
we're going to pass in another parameter.
10

11
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.880
And this is going to be a Javascript object
11

12
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.120
so inside a set of curly braces and it's going to be a key value pair.
12

13
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.550
Now the key in this case has to match with the variable name inside our home.
13

14
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.200
ejs because that is going to be the variable that we're going to pass over. So we can just simply select
14

15
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.590
Copy and paste it into here as the key.
15

16
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.560
Now the value is going to be whatever data it is that we want to pass over.
16

17
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.070
So over here that's going to be the constant home starting content so that we can pass over all of this
17

18
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.870
text into this variable called starting content and be able to render it inside his paragraph tag.
18

19
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.090
So let's go ahead and change the value to our home starting content.
19

20
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.180
So now if we hit save and we head over to our localhost then you'll see that we're rendering the home.ejs
20

21
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:57.090
page with the h1 and also a paragraph element that has the same content as what we've got inside here.
21

22
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.990
So did you manage to complete that without using too many hints?
22

23
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.910
If so then great job.
23

24
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.730
If not, then try and reduce the number of hints you need in the next challenge which is coming right
24

25
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.150
up.
