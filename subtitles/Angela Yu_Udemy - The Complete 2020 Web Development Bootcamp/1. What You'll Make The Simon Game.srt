Hello and welcome to your challenge.
1

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,100
So in this challenge module you will be building a game that is modeled off the game
2

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:17,620
Simon. So the way that it works is that you can press any key to start and it will show you a tile that
3

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,560
you have to click on.
4

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:27,760
And as you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated, and at some point you're going
5

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,300
to screw up,
6

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,040
and it's going to tell you that youâ€™ve got it wrong
7

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,310
and game is over,
8

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,540
so you can press any key to restart the game.
9

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,760
So this is going to be a challenge but it's also going to be really really fun and it's going to test
10

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,520
out your skills and what you've learned in the last module on jQuery, as well as some of the modules
11

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,560
that we have tackled previously.
12

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,110
So once you're ready,
13

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,890
head over to the next set of lessons where you'll find the instructions as well as the starter code
14

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,170
for your challenge.
15

16
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,360
So I wish you the best of luck and I'll see you on the other side.
