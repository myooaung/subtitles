00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.820
[Autogenerated] once you identified mission,

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.940
learning is the right fit for your business problem.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.040
You're next step will be to identify the right learning practice.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.640
Machine learning has three learning types.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.340
The first one is super waste learning.

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.890
This is similar to a child learning under the

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.740
guidance off a supervisor or a teacher.

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.430
Super is learning uses what we call as a label.

9
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.010
Data,

10
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.090
which means the outcome are the correct answer is already know it

11
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.950
tries to model a relationship between the inputs on the output from

12
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.260
the training data so that it can predict new outcomes for the test

13
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.540
data that you may feed later.

14
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.540
The second one is unsupervised learning.

15
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.540
This is similar to a child trying to figuring out things all by itself,

16
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.740
without any guidance or supervision.

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.240
In this technique,

18
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.940
you allow the model to work on it soon on discover information.

19
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.180
Unsupervised Learning uses unlabeled data and tries to

20
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.040
predict unknown patents in the data.

21
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.040
Third technique is reinforcement learning.

22
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.540
Imagine every time your kid exhibits a good behavior,

23
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.390
you reward our incentivize a kid to strengthen our reinforce

24
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.070
that specific behavior reinforcement learning uses the same

25
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.240
strategy on their is no level data.

26
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.910
It tries to study the problem and try to retrofit its model in order to improve.

27
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.640
Consider business questions like how much will be the monthly sales next month?

28
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.320
How many customers are likely to renew the

29
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.040
subscriptions off this specific services?

30
00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.340
How many customers are likely to reorder the product in our website?

31
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.340
The answers to these questions are quantitative are continuous in nature.

32
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.940
To address business problems like this,

33
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.340
you'll be using any of the regression algorithms.

34
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.640
Regression Model studies the data for a relationship between input variables,

35
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.940
also known as independent variables,

36
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.640
with its corresponding output variables also learn is dependent variables.

37
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.340
With this knowledge, it can predict output responses for new, unseen data.

38
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.140
Regression models can be further classified into two broad categories.

39
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.340
First one is linear regression.

40
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.540
In a simple linear regression.

41
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.250
You have one independent variable X on one dependent variable.

42
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.120
Wi-Fi and algorithm will try to fit a slope line through all the point so

43
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.860
that the distance between the point in the line to the actual point is

44
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.040
minimum to check the accuracy of the model.

45
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.790
If you just sum the errors, it could possibly be zero,

46
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.040
because a positive error URL could potentially negative and negative error,

47
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.680
so you should Squire the error on then some disk wired error.

48
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.170
URL second one is a multiple.

49
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.140
Regression are multi variant regression.

50
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.980
In this case, you have one dependent variable.

51
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.540
Why, with multiple independent variables,

52
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.440
Polynomial regression is a special case off multiple regression where

53
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.670
the dependent variable Why is model as end the degree polynomial off

54
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.840
the input feature Our dependent variable X.

55
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.340
You primarily use this when the relationship doesn't look linear,

56
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.100
and you can use a polynomial line to minimize the

57
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.440
error and better fit the morning.

58
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.560
Now consider business questions like Is a patient

59
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.340
affected with the wine is or not?

60
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.770
Will the customer renew?

61
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.740
The service is a email, Spam or not?

62
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.540
The answers to these questions are discreet in nature.

63
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.730
To AD DS business problems like these,

64
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.290
you will use classifications algorithms when the number of

65
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.550
discrete possible outcomes is a simple yes,

66
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.540
no are true falsy.

67
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.440
It's called a binary classifications.

68
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.540
When the number of distinct classes is more than two,

69
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.540
it is called a multi class classification.

70
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.790
A simple example of a multi class classification is when you want

71
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.500
the model to predict the handwritten digits.

72
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.140
In this case, the digit can be anywhere between 0 to 9.

73
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.640
To predict the accuracy of the model,

74
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.130
you typically draw a confusion metrics and Docker metrics

75
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.840
like accuracy position on F one score.

76
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.480
We will see all these metrics in details later on.

77
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.740
In this course,

78
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.930
consider business questions like what are the top most common complaints by

79
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.450
customer while using this product or a service to others?

80
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.750
Business cases like these you will use unsupervised learning.

81
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.440
On specifically, you will use clustering algorithms.

82
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.210
Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that try to

83
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.010
find patents of similarity on relationship.

84
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.840
Among the input data samples on then cluster these samples into various groups,

85
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.540
such that each group, our cluster of data,

86
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.310
has some similarity.

87
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.940
Sometimes when you have a lot of data features,

88
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.700
the model training process will become extremely complex

89
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.020
because off memory on space constraints.

90
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.840
This is also called us curse off dimensionality.

91
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.740
Dimensionality reduction is another type off unsupervised

92
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.980
learning that can be used in cases like these to reduce the

93
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.740
number of features from the input data.

94
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.540
As you start collecting and processing data,

95
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.040
you may see that there are some data points that are outliers.

96
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.340
This can be rare evens and may occur infrequently.

97
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.340
Unsupervised learning can be used for anomaly detection.

98
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:36.000
A normally detection is extremely popular in real life scenarios like security violation, identifying network issues and so on.
