00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.870
Git has been around for a while,

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.580
so you might wonder whether this training covers the

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.940
version of Git that you're using, and it probably does.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.490
I'm recording this in 2021,

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.890
but almost everything we'll say here works the same on

6
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.640
even much older versions of Git, with a couple minor exceptions maybe.

7
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.420
The most noticeable exception by far is,

8
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.120
in this training we'll use the git switch command to move to another

9
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.290
branch. And that command is relatively recent.

10
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.190
A few years ago you used git checkout instead of

11
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.150
switch to move to another branch.

12
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.400
So if you see that switch doesn't work on your version of Git,

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.820
use checkout, and you're golden.

14
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.740
For the purpose of this training, they work the same way.

15
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.170
Anyway, I'll remind you of this when we get there,

16
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.140
so you don't need to take a note about this.

17
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.410
And if a new version of Git ever changes anything that we say in this training,

18
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.710
then I'll update the training as soon as I can.

19
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.570
That doesn't happen often,

20
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.120
because we'll cover fundamental features of Git that change regularly.

21
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.230
Last time it took over 5 years before I had to tweak

22
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.940
the information in this training.

23
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:20.000
But if you do notice anything obsolete, please let me know. Post a comment on the discussion board, and I'll be on it.
