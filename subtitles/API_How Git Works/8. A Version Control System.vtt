00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.820
So, let's recap.

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.060
Branches, merges, rebases, tags, these are the main features to target from a

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.540
stupid content tracker into a full revision control system.

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.820
It took us a lot of talking, two entire modules,

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.350
half of this training, to go through the version features, but

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.840
we finally completed this layer of the onion.

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.880
Now we only have one more layer to go, and then we will know the entire onion.

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.000
We'll have the full picture of Git and how it works. So let's talk about that last layer.
