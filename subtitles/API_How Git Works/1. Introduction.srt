Hello, and welcome to the last module of How Git Works.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,460
We're only missing one last layer in our description of the Git onion,

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,740
but it's a really important one, distribution.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,900
So far, we imagine that there is only one computer in the world,

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,240
the computer that you are running Git on.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:28,000
Now let's see what happens if you use Git the way it's used in practice to share a project across multiple computers.
