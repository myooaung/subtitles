00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.740
At the beginning of this training, I promised that by the end of it,

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
you would understand how Git really works.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.940
Congratulations!

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.440
Now you do.

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.070
To get here, we started right from the core of Git,

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.550
a simple map of hashes to objects, then we looked into those objects,

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.290
and we got to the point where we could see Git as a stupid content

8
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.740
tracker that tracks changes to your files and directories.

9
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.660
From there, we moved on to the revision control features of Git.

10
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.390
We talked about branches, and merges, and rebases.

11
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.820
And finally,

12
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.680
we looked at the distribution‑related features of Git that are probably

13
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.340
the main reason why you use Git in the first place.

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.840
And there it is, the whole Onion.

15
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.340
We wrapped our heads around the entire thing.

16
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.240
This is all you need to go on exploring Git on your own.

17
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.290
Sure, if you are planning to use Git a lot,

18
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.920
and then there are still plenty of things that you might want

19
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.440
to learn about, more advanced features, dozens of command‑line options,

20
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.530
okay, actually hundreds of command‑line options.

21
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.990
But now that you understand the fundamentals,

22
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.640
you can confidently keep learning without fear of getting confused.

23
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.340
And if you liked this training, you might want to do two things,

24
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.120
first, rate this training on Pluralsight,

25
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.840
and if you have a minute, even leave me a comment here with feedback.

26
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.140
I love ratings, and I love feedback.

27
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.680
And also,

28
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.220
you can move on to this other training that I published here on Pluralsight.

29
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.670
It's called Mastering Git,

30
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.440
and it goes a few steps further than describing the Git Onion.

31
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.190
In a sense, it tells you how to cook the onion.

32
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.700
It explains the more sophisticated commands and techniques that you will

33
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.940
want to know when you're using Git in your daily job.

34
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:58.000
That was it. Thanks a lot for watching this training and have fun on your way to Git mastery.
