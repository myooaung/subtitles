00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.932
The last section of the course was fast and furious,

2
00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:07.348
but we managed to get a working API application up and running.

3
00:00:07.348 --> 00:00:08.352
Now that we have that,

4
00:00:08.352 --> 00:00:10.988
we can take a deeper in-depth look at how to

5
00:00:10.988 --> 00:00:14.266
customize our app the Spring Boot way.

6
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.104
If you're working on an application as a team,

7
00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:19.907
you often run into the problems like how do you prevent coding in the

8
00:00:19.907 --> 00:00:23.944
production database credentials in a configuration file and then checking that

9
00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:27.994
into source control where everyone can have access to it,

10
00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:32.327
or how do I set up application configuration for different environments?

11
00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:34.886
In staging, you want to enable full logging,

12
00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:38.686
but in production, you want to only log errors and warnings.

13
00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:39.732
We'll answer these questions,

14
00:00:39.732 --> 00:00:47.000
as well as dive into a few other good to know Spring Boot configuration tips and tricks, coming up next!
