1
00:00:01,408 --> 00:00:04,570
Let's take a moment and look at the Pluralsight LIVE conference site to get

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,430
an idea of some of the concepts that we'll be coding up.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,417
This was the agenda for the 2019 Pluralsight LIVE

4
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:14,784
conference held in Salt Lake City.

5
00:00:14,784 --> 00:00:19,303
Towards the top, there is a general overview of the agenda with the schedule.

6
00:00:19,303 --> 00:00:22,234
And as you scroll down, it takes us to the Breakout sessions.

7
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:25,942
These sessions are essentially what we'll be creating.

8
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,250
We'll have some data structures and endpoints around

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,655
sessions and speakers for a conference.

10
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:34,044
An example of a session would be LESSONS LEARNED

11
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:37,731
BUILDING A GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY ORGANIZATION.

12
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:40,995
Sessions obviously have speakers or presenters associated with it,

13
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:45,132
and in this case, you can see that there are two presenters,

14
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:48,330
Shawn Malhotra and Thomson Reuters.

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,028
If you expand the session title, you can also see a summary of the session.

16
00:00:53,028 --> 00:00:55,726
The topic in the description will be also something

17
00:00:55,726 --> 00:00:58,401
that we'll include in our application.

18
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:01,167
There are a lot of other things like session tags and the session

19
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:04,661
schedules which we won't be building simply due to time,

20
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:07,349
but that will give you something to work on on your own.

21
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:10,857
The more practice you have building and working with Spring Boot and Spring,

22
00:01:10,857 --> 00:01:12,264
the better you'll get.

23
00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:18,000
So now that we have a basic general idea of what we'll be building, let's go ahead and get started.
