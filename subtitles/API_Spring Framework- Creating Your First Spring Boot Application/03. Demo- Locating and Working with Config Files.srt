1
00:00:01,261 --> 00:00:03,725
Apps set up with an even layout separate out Java

2
00:00:03,725 --> 00:00:06,247
source files from other types of files.

3
00:00:06,247 --> 00:00:09,008
This means that the application property files for your

4
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,886
Spring Boot app are located in src, main,

5
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:12,419
resources.

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,984
So I'm going to go ahead and open up that folder,

7
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:18,449
and you'll notice there's a file called application.properties.

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,527
We'll reopen that because we've already made some changes to this file.

9
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:23,765
When we set up the app,

10
00:00:23,765 --> 00:00:27,086
we added the data source in jpa.properties to this file

11
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:29,533
so that our app would work correctly.

12
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:32,131
One thing that you should know is these properties are actually

13
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:37,523
overrides of Spring Boot default properties.

14
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:38,508
I've jumped over to a browser,

15
00:00:38,508 --> 00:00:43,530
and I've opened up this URL to this Spring Boot Common application properties.

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,597
If this URL goes out of date in the future,

17
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:49,000
simply go to a Google search and look for Spring

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,369
Boot Common application properties, and you'll be able to find this Appendix A.

19
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,458
Spring Boot and Spring Boot starters provide a setup of default properties,

20
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,523
and these properties provide sensible defaults,

21
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:03,609
as well as provides an application developer the ability to customize

22
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:07,312
the application with having to write or change code.

23
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:09,127
If I take one of the properties we configured,

24
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:13,316
like the spring.datasource .url, and search for it,

25
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:15,478
you can see the default, which is null,

26
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,158
and see what starter or system the property comes from.

27
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:22,617
In this case, it's handled by the DataSourceProperties.

28
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:25,266
As I scroll up, you can see it's coming from DataSourceProperties,

29
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:30,068
as well as the DataSourceAutoConfiguration class that Spring

30
00:01:30,068 --> 00:01:33,597
Boot provides in the Spring Data JPA starter.

31
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:37,591
Let's try taking another default property and changing it in our application.

32
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:38,722
The app, by default,

33
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:42,953
runs on port 8080 as you've seen when you ran it after we built the app.

34
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:45,355
So let's go ahead and change that.

35
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,428
We want to find a property called server.port.

36
00:01:48,428 --> 00:01:51,120
You can see that the default value is set to 8080.

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,954
So how do you think that we could change this to say port 5000?

38
00:01:56,954 --> 00:02:00,456
Well, all we need to do is simply put this in our property file and override it.

39
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:05,727
So I'll go ahead and copy this value and jump back to IntelliJ.

40
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:07,849
Back in the application.properties,

41
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:12,363
we can simply add that new property to the end of the file

42
00:02:12,363 --> 00:02:14,641
and override the value to port 5000.

43
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:17,438
If I save that file and restart the application,

44
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:25,696
come down to the Run tab to do that, and start up the application,

45
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:28,451
you can see now that Tomcat is started on port 5000,

46
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:32,556
and that's all it takes to override the Spring default common

47
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:35,762
application properties to simply put it in your application and

48
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:44,000
provide the value that suits your needs. Next, let's take a look at overriding app properties with external configuration.
