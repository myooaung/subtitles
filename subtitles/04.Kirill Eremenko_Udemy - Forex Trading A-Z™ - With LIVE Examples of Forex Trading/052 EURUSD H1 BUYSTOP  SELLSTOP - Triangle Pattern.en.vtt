00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.230
Hello this is Kirill from four explode dot com.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.850
And welcome back to the course on forex trading in today's tutorial we will continue trading on our

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.610
live real Forex account.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.680
And today's actually going to be quite a different tutorial and that's because we're not going to open

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.290
a market order but rather we will open to pending orders on our account.

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:32.400
As you can see in front of us here we have the Eurodollar hourly timeframe and I've marked out some

7
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.710
findings that I have located on the chart.

8
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.590
So with the yellow lines this concentrate on the yellow lines to start with.

9
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.450
We've got a triangle marked up and we just triangle's previously on this course.

10
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:55.560
And as you remember triangle's mean that the market is kind of getting into a consolidation phase or

11
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.870
something that's going to happen just now in the market.

12
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:06.090
And so in this already time friend Eurodollar has been in this triangle formation for several days so

13
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.870
these periods separators indicate days and that's one two three four five six or five and a half days

14
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.640
or five full days.

15
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.430
The market has been in this triangle and as you can see there's no escape out of this triangled the

16
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.270
only way the market can go is either up or down can just continue the triangle because it's coming to

17
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.570
an end over here.

18
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.180
So and that's what we're going to take advantage of.

19
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.100
But before we get to that let's just have a look at how the Eurodollar has been moving in the past couple

20
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.520
of months.

21
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.010
So I'll zoom out a bit and if we go back you'll see here is another triangle that had occurred previously

22
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.850
this was in January of this year.

23
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:58.110
And as you can see the price was in a triangle for several days and then it burst out downwards I marked

24
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.250
it with a red line here where the burst occurred.

25
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.540
So that's a that's that triangle over here.

26
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.980
And then previously before that there was another triangle.

27
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:19.080
Once again the price was in a triangle for a while and then it burst down before that the price was

28
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.170
in a channel soldiers amount.

29
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.690
As you remember we also discussed channels and we used them in our trading quite a bit already.

30
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.230
The price was in the channel and then it crossed the border and burst down here.

31
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.400
The price was in a triangle and then burst out upwards.

32
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.530
But then so went down.

33
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.910
Also let's see if you can spot a channel right here.

34
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.310
I'll just mark it out so you can see a channel here.

35
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.380
It's changed to yellow

36
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:02.440
and there so as you can see the prices in the channel here then burst outwards downwards.

37
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.960
So there have been a couple of instances where the price was either in a channel or in a triangle and

38
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.630
there was a burst.

39
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.780
Another thing that you will notice is that currently we are in a downward trend.

40
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.860
And all of these both of these triangles that have already happened and this channel the most recent

41
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.220
one they all burst downwards.

42
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.970
So it is much more likely that this triangle's also going to burst downwards because we are in a downward

43
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.970
trend so the dollar is strengthening the euro is declining.

44
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.150
That's important to remember because that will tell us which trade is more riskier too.

45
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:52.200
Another thing is that even though this triangle here it burst out upwards the price still continued

46
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.600
downwards afterwards.

47
00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.350
And that was because this temporary movement this upward movement was actually a retracement of the

48
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.240
overall downward trend that we can observe.

49
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.220
So if we zoom out even more you can see that the euro has been in a downward trend for quite some time

50
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.880
now.

51
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.900
And so too many ways lives now.

52
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.770
All right so that tells gives us a good indication that the downward trade is more reliable.

53
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.670
The upward trade is less reliable.

54
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:37.200
In fact you might not even want to conduct this upward trend or prepare it because it's it's quite quite

55
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.910
risky compared to the cell trait that will do both.

56
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.670
And in this situation and we'll manage our risks accordingly.

57
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.660
So we've gotto buy stop and sell stop ready.

58
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:59.930
As we discussed previously triangles generally tend to burst out for about half of their base.

59
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.440
And so if this orange line marks the base here then this is a copy of that same orange line.

60
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.180
Then half of it is about where this little orange line sticks out.

61
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.850
And same way here.

62
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.940
Half of it is about where this little orange line sticks out so it can burst further than that but can

63
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.740
burst just about that exact distance and that's where we will set out take profits so this cell stop

64
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.710
as we discussed in the tutorial on pending orders.

65
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:36.040
It'll be triggered once the price crosses the line and hopefully the price will keep going and then

66
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.900
it will trigger out take profits so we'll settle take profit actually a bit higher than this orange

67
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.360
line.

68
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.290
And for that buy stuff we'll set the taper off at a bit lower than or like the stop losses for the sell

69
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.540
stop will set the stop loss at the level of the Bicester border and for the buyer stop will set the

70
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.440
stop loss at the level of a sell stop order.

71
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.080
So that's all taken into consideration.

72
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.760
The last thing we have to go into account is our risks.

73
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.750
So to do that we will have to find out how many pips are in a stop loss and there's about 90 pips and

74
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.850
the stop loss.

75
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.160
So I'm just going to bring up the slides that allow us to calculate lots.

76
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.290
So I've got the formula up in front of us here for a sell order we're we'll risk about 10 percent of

77
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:29.770
our balance and that's about 10 percent of $659 about $66 will plug it into a formula.

78
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.030
Now all we have to do is enter the number of people in our Stop-Loss which is about 90 pips.

79
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:46.630
So that gives us 66 divided by 900 which is approximately zero point zero seven lots.

80
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:52.300
Now let's perform the same calculation but for the buy order we we're willing to risk less.

81
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:59.030
About half as much so 5 percent of our balance and that's about $33.

82
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:06.470
Let's plug that in and I'm doing this calculation thirty three divided by 900 and that's because the

83
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.780
distance of the stop loss is exactly the same.

84
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.240
And that gives us about zero point zero three six which is approximately 0.04 So let's put that in.

85
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.940
Zero point zero was.

86
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.850
So now let's create these orders.

87
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.530
We click and you order 30 Eurodollar volumes are a point 0 7 that's going to be our sell order sell

88
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.130
stop.

89
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:37.180
It's going to be a pending order we have to click that in the pending order we are going to choose a

90
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:43.390
sell stop the price is going to be one point 1 2 9 0.

91
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:49.020
The stop loss as we agree is 1 point 3 9 0 to take profit.

92
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:59.650
I've got to treat it down here so it's going to be one point 1 2 5 0 and comment on the number 5 sell

93
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:00.810
stop.

94
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.550
Just take everything very quickly.

95
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:04.910
Looks good.

96
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:10.380
And oh yes we can also set an expiry date for our stop loss.

97
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.160
So how about we set.

98
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.160
We'll give it two days or maybe even one day should be enough.

99
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:26.740
So that is that's today we set this day tomorrow at about the same.

100
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.490
Well not this time do we want to set.

101
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.270
Yeah let's give it just over one day.

102
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:39.320
So we'll place that click place.

103
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.850
That's our pending order placed.

104
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.650
It's hiding behind us sell stuff over here so we can.

105
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.390
Our trend line or here.

106
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.040
Actually I think I said the stop loss at the wrong price so this price should have actually been

107
00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:05.830
18 or 19 and we'll just quickly correct that so if we go to trade and we modify this is how you can

108
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.660
modify pending orders and your stop loss should be just adjusted over here.

109
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.460
It's very simple could modify.

110
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.490
OK.

111
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.530
So the stop loss is not hiding behind the blue line.

112
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.630
And now we will conduct our Buy Stop order.

113
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:32.570
So pending order by stop one point 1 3 8 0 stop loss 1 point 1 2 9 0.

114
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:33.490
Take profitable.

115
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:38.370
I'm going to run down so it's one point 1 4 1 5 comments.

116
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.790
This is number five by stop

117
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.500
and expiry date.

118
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.000
Same thing.

119
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.420
Let it expire tomorrow place.

120
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.730
OK.

121
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:59.630
So let's just see if we can.

122
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:05.170
OK we caught we if you want to see the expiry date and you have to double click on the order and just

123
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.700
check expiry date.

124
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.120
Second of course the second or fourth are perfect.

125
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:15.420
So you just need to quickly double check everything here.

126
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:22.120
For instance I can see right away that I set the wrong volume for the Bicester order and I'm just going

127
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:29.050
to therefore delete this by slip order and reset it.

128
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.770
So zero point zero for

129
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:48.100
pending order by stop 1.1 3 8 0 stop loss 1 1 1 2 9 0 tape profit 1 point 1 4 1 5

130
00:10:50.590 --> 00:11:02.690
5 by Stolpe comment actually expiry date check everything place Okay that should be done.

131
00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.900
So that's our stealth sell stock that's how by stop.

132
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.600
Everything else looks OK.

133
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:17.230
So that was a good example of how you can quickly delete pending orders without any effect on that count

134
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:23.020
because they're actually not in the market they're not they'll really exist as market orders.

135
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:31.750
They're just an intention for you to buy or sell but you'll still see your deleted order here and you'll

136
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:37.960
see in the Commons you'll see that it says cancelled because you manually cancelled this particular

137
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.210
order.

138
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.230
OK so he's just going to leave that account for a couple days and see how all this plays out.

139
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:49.000
So either one of these orders or maybe even both will be triggered and maybe nothing will be triggered

140
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.150
if the price doesn't escape this trial and then the next one hop days.

141
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.910
I look for it see a mix of.

142
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.160
Until then happy trading
