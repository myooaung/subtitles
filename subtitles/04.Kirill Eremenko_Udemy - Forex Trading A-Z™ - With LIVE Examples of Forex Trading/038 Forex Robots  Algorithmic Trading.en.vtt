1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.460
Forex robots.

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:09.000
So in meditative for folks Robers are also called expert advisors and the whole topic that we're talking

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.810
about in this Tauriel is called algorithmic trading.

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.800
So what is it what is algorithmic trading and what are these four attributes.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.580
So far it's rubout can be envisaged as an actual robot but in reality it's a program.

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.100
It's like a computer program which can work through a trader for some programs work for five minutes

7
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.920
or four.

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.090
And the concept behind it is that if you want this program on for a short it's supposed to bring your

9
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.050
profits automatically.

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:46.740
So you basically just set some inputs for the program and you let it run and they just earn the money

11
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.600
in the background.

12
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.460
So let's talk about this for a second.

13
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.670
A lot of traders think this is a hoax this is not possible this is you know the dream of any investor

14
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.750
that you just know nothing and the money is earned in the background.

15
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:14.040
And to some extent it is true it's not it's not entirely possible to just have money coming into your

16
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.600
trading account all the time with with no effort at all.

17
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.800
And there are a lot of scams out there on the market just in the Internet that will tell you by this

18
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.320
forex robot and it'll earn you money and you'll be rich and you'll never have to worry about trading

19
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.640
again.

20
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:41.190
So 90 percent or 95 percent of the stuff you see on the Internet are scams that just trying to get your

21
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.660
money as quickly as possible before their system starts to fail.

22
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.970
But the truth is that algorithmic trading is actually possible and it does work and I'm a live example

23
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.400
of that.

24
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.720
I'm a live example of the success that I've had in algorithmic trading.

25
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:07.260
Most of my trading like people sometimes ask me like what strategies do you use and like how often do

26
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.780
you trade and things like that.

27
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.710
But most of my trade trading strategies are actually all have all been converted into Forex robots and

28
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.460
I have made tens of thousands of dollars just using Forex robots.

29
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.160
And actually I try to stay away from manual trading because of the convenience that trading for X robots

30
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.140
brings which we'll talk about in a minute.

31
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.880
But just I just wanted to emphasize that the training of robots is possible.

32
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.800
It does bring you money and it has massive advantages when you're actually into it when you know what

33
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.200
you're doing it's not effortless.

34
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.270
It's not just switch it on and go away.

35
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:58.380
It does require maintenance it requires certain inputs from the trainer or certain decisions which robots

36
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.990
to put on which ones to take off.

37
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.180
And real optimization and things like that.

38
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.380
But the bottom line is it's possible and it's highly at the stages.

39
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:15.120
So some of the advantages that algorithmic trading brings to you as opposed to our when compared to

40
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.320
manual trading.

41
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.400
Well first one of course is you get the freedom of time like Forex the Forex market does give you financial

42
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.750
freedom in terms of if you master it you won't have to go to work anymore and you can trade from anyplace

43
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.000
on the planet but it doesn't give you freedom of time.

44
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.310
You still have to follow your trading strategy you still have to watch the charts you still even at

45
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.150
least a couple of hours a day you will have to sit in front of your computer and make decisions whereas

46
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:57.450
when you turn your trade strategy into a forex robot you can set it on your chart and just let it run

47
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.210
in the background while you sleep while you have fun with friends and family and you just have to check

48
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.010
up on it once a week or you know several times a week.

49
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:14.550
But generally it frees up the constraints that you may experience when your trainee strategy requires

50
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.590
you to be in front of the computer and that's for me that's a massive advantage.

51
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.200
And like I even took it to the next level through setting up a virtual private server where my folks

52
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.710
are able to run so I don't even have to use my home computer.

53
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.570
So it's just sitting somewhere and it's a free country and the Forest Service was running and I can

54
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.970
just check on it once every couple of weeks even and see that everything is going all right.

55
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.010
The second massive advantage of algorithmic trading which can sum some for some people be even more

56
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:53.910
poor than the first one is second the psychological side of things that when you're trading with your

57
00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:03.150
own like hands and when you brush your own mindset you have to make certain decisions and you have to

58
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:10.700
watch the market and like see your profits and losses and that can be very good.

59
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:20.520
I can have a massive toll on your emotional state and it can devastate you when you see a loss or it

60
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.010
can even being happy about a profit.

61
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.070
So that's that's a good thing.

62
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.670
Maybe you might think it is but in reality it's not you should for it's should be cold blooded and like

63
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.310
ideally it should and shouldn't be happy about profits because if you're happy about profits you're

64
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.870
going to be devastated when you see losses.

65
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.120
Everything should be calculated and you'll see that in our section of live real trading that our risks

66
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:54.510
will be very diligently calculated and we will know exactly how much we are risking to lose and things

67
00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.660
like that so that when the time comes to open a trade you're not emotionally involved and that's very

68
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.650
important.

69
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.180
With forex trading.

70
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.330
So what's for robots allow you to do is they take out the emotional side of things completely.

71
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.250
Because it's a robot training for you and because you don't even look at the market or you're relying

72
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:21.510
on is that your training strategy is correct you've come up for good training strategy and it's just

73
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.300
going to bring your money in in the long run.

74
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.750
So even if you have five profits and one loss then you have you're generally making more money than

75
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.400
you losing then you'll be you know you'll have profits so you don't have to worry about the losses and

76
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.930
be happy about the profitable trades individually.

77
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.720
You just look at the big picture when you have 4 x robot.

78
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.760
So those are the two main game changing advances that forex robots bring.

79
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:55.770
It's not to say that manual trading is not a great option is not is not something that you want to pursue

80
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.920
.

81
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.570
Definitely you have to start with manual training.

82
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.120
And some people just stay mandatories because they get passionate about it and they love what they're

83
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.680
doing and they genuinely enjoy trolling the charts.

84
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:13.020
However just keep in mind that there is this option of trading before x robots and maybe you want.

85
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.200
