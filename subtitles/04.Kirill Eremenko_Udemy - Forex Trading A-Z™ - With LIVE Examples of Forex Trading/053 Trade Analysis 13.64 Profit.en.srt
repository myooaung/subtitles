00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,620
Good morning and welcome back and congratulations as you can see the euro dollar shot through the top

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,520
border of the triangle triggered by start converting into a buy order and here out take profit at the

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,350
top.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,340
So that's a fantastic result.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,230
And I just love seeing these things in the morning when I wake up.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,660
When you leave a trade overnight and even a pending order and you wake up and it's turned into profit

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,120
it's just a fantastic feeling.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,580
OK so let's just drag this onto the chart and see how it went here.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,260
You can even really see it because it happened all so quickly within the space of one hour so that's

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,340
where we entered into the market that's where I'll buy stop order was triggered and converted into a

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:01:00,370
buy order and then it the price kept going up and triggered our take profit and we got our revenue.

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,950
So that's a great result.

13
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:09,090
And if we look down here you'll see that the Buy Stop order was changed to buy order.

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,080
So this by stop order that has nothing to do with it.

15
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,280
That's the one where the lot size was incorrect and we deleted it.

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:25,080
So here all by stop order was triggered and changed into by order and then the profit was reached and

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,040
we got our profit of $13 and 64 cents.

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,630
Now that doesn't sound like a lot but let's put that into perspective.

19
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:40,950
Thirteen dollars and 64 cents represents approximately 2 percent of the balance that we had at the time

20
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,520
.

21
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:47,640
So we earn 2 percent in the space of several hours.

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:57,120
That's incredible when you think that banks will only offer you a couple of percent maybe four or five

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,730
percent maximum on your savings deposit for a year.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,630
That's four or five percent in a year whereas here we were able to make 2 percent in just the space

25
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,910
of a few hours.

26
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,650
So I'll let you think about that.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,570
What are we going to do now is an important bit.

28
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:25,950
And we have to close or delete our pending sell stop orders so as you can see the market is going upward

29
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,070
.

30
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,350
So this order has become obsolete.

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:37,230
The sell stop and we need to get rid of it because yes it will automatically expire sometime later today

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,480
.

33
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:44,670
However we don't want to risk just keeping it in the market because the price might still go down and

34
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,600
trigger it and that's not part of our strategy.

35
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,140
So let's go ahead and do that.

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,420
We'll go to the trade tab and we've got the sell stop order here.

37
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,650
All we have to do is double click the order this window pops up and all we have to do is simply click

38
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,960
delete and that's done.

39
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,610
Now if we go back to our account history you'll see that we've got the sell stop order here.

40
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:16,200
Now the orders are all ranked by their order number if you want to rank them by the time when you close

41
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,650
them just cook time and your cell stop order will be right at the bottom over here because we did close

42
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,110
at last.

43
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,830
All right so that's all for today.

44
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:33,630
Just to sum up in the Prius tutorial in this tutorial we saw how to use Buy Stop and sell stop orders

45
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,630
which was important we know we learn how to modify them how to delete them and just generally how to

46
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,590
use them in combination to create this kind of burst out strategy.

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,980
And also we worked with the triangle a very simple yet powerful feature on the forex market.

48
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,220
A good take away from yesterday's analysis was that if you see consistent behavior in the market that

49
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,030
the market is recognizing for instance triangle patterns and one triangled burst out and then another

50
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,700
burst out and now you see a third triangle forming then is a good chance that this triangle will work

51
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,190
too.

52
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,700
So a better chance than if it's just the first triangle you see on the chart.

53
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:25,650
And that applies across all types of figures or all types of indicators that you might be using a market

54
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,340
and that just means that the market is in that type of phase.

55
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:36,530
And all of the participants are also looking for those same patterns or figures or indicators.

56
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,410
I'll leave it at that.

57
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,830
We had a great trade and now it's time to move on with the day.

58
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,680
By the way if you haven't yet through review please do.

59
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,230
Adrea like to know what you think about the scores.

60
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,530
I look forward to seeing our next tutorial and until then happy trading
