00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.770
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.120
I just woke up and saw the good news and I'm super excited to share with you.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:13.110
So over at night well overnight for me there was a massive movement in the British pound dollar in exactly

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.090
the direction that we predicted.

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.530
And as you can see here here at the bottom I'll trade closed at a take profit and we earned thirty nine

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
and sixty two dollars.

7
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.750
Real dollars on the floor X market with this one single trade.

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.450
So let's quickly have a look at how it exactly played out.

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.330
I was going to take this trade and drag it onto the chart.

10
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.620
As you can see it's now been placed on the chart for me.

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.960
So now if I change these two bars and I zoom in a bit we can see that's our trade over there.

12
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.980
So what exactly happened this red line indicates where we entered.

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:04.410
So we didn't know any of this so when we conducted our trade and the price did come up a closer to moving

14
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.610
our edge again it bounced off the moving average and went straight down.

15
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:17.220
And as you can remember the way we set out take profit was just above this strong support line at about

16
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.340
five fifty six one point fifty six 500 up.

17
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.180
Yes.

18
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.320
Strong support line.

19
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:35.070
And because the price had a potential to be uncertain around that level and jump back from it.

20
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:44.750
So we said I'll take profit at a conservative 1.5 to 6 650 so 5 pips above that line.

21
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.350
And as you can see that's exactly what happened.

22
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.690
The price was very uncertain around this line just as it was back here in the previous days.

23
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.440
This line was quite a strong support line.

24
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:08.040
So the price did exhibit some uncertainty around this area even though it did eventually bounce up and

25
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.220
then down.

26
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.850
So we could have earned potentially more profit if we said out take profit here in this particular case

27
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.900
.

28
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:22.770
We did exactly the right thing by setting to take profit just above that area because there was no guarantee

29
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.670
that the price wouldn't go straight back up.

30
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.840
And moreover imagine sitting in a trade.

31
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.730
And if you take profits over here somewhere and seeing all of this and seeing the price go back against

32
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.150
you there's a strong negative psychological experience when you see this going back up and that's psychology

33
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.480
something we'll talk about it at a different time.

34
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.300
But in any case never beat yourself up if you didn't take the whole movement.

35
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.020
In this case we got what we were aiming for and that is perfect.

36
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.570
So there you go.

37
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.900
That's a good real example of how to trade the moving average on the forex market.

38
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.000
And just before we finish up today I wanted to say that it's a good rule of thumb is to look at the

39
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.860
moving average as a moving support or resistance line.

40
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.280
So usually Esparza's lines are horizontal and they're static.

41
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.610
However the moving average can be regarded as a moving type of resistance or support line.

42
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.090
So in this case soon as the price went through the moving average it went down.

43
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.400
And then the price went back up tried to test the moving average which in this case became the resistance

44
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.280
line.

45
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.300
It couldn't go through and then tried to start again couldn't go through then went straight down.

46
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.780
We got a profit and that was the end of this trade.

47
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.840
So have a look at the moving average in that new fashion and if you find the kind of writer period of

48
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.610
the moving average for your chart then you can actually have quite successful trades through this method

49
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.700
actually very successful trades if you do the analysis properly.

50
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.250
Thanks for your attention and I look forward to seeing you next time.

51
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.690
Until then happy trading
