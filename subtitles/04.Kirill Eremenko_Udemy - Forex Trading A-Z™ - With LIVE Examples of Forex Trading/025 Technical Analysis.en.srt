1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,100
Technical analysis this type of analysis is based purely on the belief that all available information

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,310
in the world is already accounted for in the price and therefore you need to do is analyze the charts

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,110
because if all the information is there any contained in the charts then there's no need to analyze

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,190
news.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:26,250
Interest rates of countries or even events like wars or very good harvests in different countries that

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:33,630
affect these currencies because youre assuming that all of the information is already reflected in the

7
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,780
price at any given point in time.

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,400
Traders who use technical analysis believe that prices move in trends and historical patterns tend to

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,770
repeat themselves and that is what a technical trader would take advantage of seeing a certain situation

10
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,290
that he's seen before and knowing how it resolved in the past.

11
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,770
He can make a certain assumption of how it will resolve today and best not make predictions and enter

12
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:06,550
the market in a way technical trading is more precise and definitive than fundamental trading because

13
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:12,210
in fundamental trading you have to use your own expertise knowledge and assessment of the situation

14
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,350
you are expressing a subjective view on what will happen.

15
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,380
Whereas in technical trading you are looking at patterns which happened in the past and based on that

16
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,330
information driving certain rules for your trading systems to act in the present day.

17
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,300
Therefore you're being objective.

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,720
That's a very big advantage of technical analysis.

19
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:41,970
It's removes psychology from trading so you're not worried about whether you made the right call or

20
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,240
not.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,960
Because you have taken yourself out of the equation once you've set up these rules.

22
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,550
You only have to do is follow them strictly and precisely if you've set them up correctly.

23
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,110
You should make a profit a very high chance of success.

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:03,090
Therefore you're not worried and staying up late at night or not being able to see another good advantage

25
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,230
of technical trading is that in contrast to fundamental analysis you don't have to develop an intimacy

26
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:16,560
with the concept of trading because charts are of course different kinds repairers will have different

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,690
styles of chards different types of movements.

28
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,140
But as so long that you've learned how to analyze one two three four different currency pairs you will

29
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,530
start seeing consistent themes across different currency pairs and you will be able to easily switch

30
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,710
between analyzing different currency pairs.

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,080
You because you're not that invested into the knowledge base of a certain kind of spray you don't have

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,210
to keep economic events about it you don't have to know who the he is box people are for that country

33
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,740
and interest rates and so on.

34
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:55,890
It's very easy to switch between charts and takes a minimal amount of time to adjust yourself to a new

35
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,600
currency pair.

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,060
And therefore we have the luxury of trading a much more diverse portfolio of currencies.

37
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,970
When you're using technical analysis
