00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.330
Hello and welcome back in the previous tutorial we learned how to install the Metro for terminal and

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.920
open a demo account.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.340
Today we're going to learn how to navigate the trading platform.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.150
So I've got the meditator four platform open in front of me.

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.820
Let's have a look what it's called.

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.310
So right away in front of the chart and most likely your chart as God is black in color.

7
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.970
And that happens when you open up a new chart.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.230
By default they're black.

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.280
So we'll have a look at how to change a color in a minute as well.

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.030
Up at the top we've got a panel which most programs have.

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.520
Then we've got some toolbars that we hear on the left.

12
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.960
We've got a market watch window.

13
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.830
Then you've got a navigator window below that.

14
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.590
And then at the bottom we've got a whole panel of windows which are trade exposure account history news

15
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.430
and so on.

16
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.170
And of course in the middle we have the main chart.

17
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.270
So let's start with with the chart.

18
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.360
How do we open a new chart.

19
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.160
Right now we've got the adult 1 hour time frame chart open.

20
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.600
Let's see how we open in Q1.

21
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.860
Well in the market watch we right click on the curve speir that we want to see and weekly chart window

22
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.330
and the window pops up as you can see the window is right away black and that's the default color for

23
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.400
measure 4.

24
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.190
You can change it very easily.

25
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.760
Right click on the chart go to properties and color scheme and then change it to whichever one you want

26
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.950
.

27
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.220
You can specify your own schema on the right here.

28
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.500
OK.

29
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.620
And we've got the chart.

30
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.520
So next or so we can go to properties common and if we uncheck the show grid we won't see the grid in

31
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.790
the background because it can be distracting at times.

32
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.630
So that's good by default is you can see the chart that was open as the British pound dollar one already

33
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.650
time for a chart.

34
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.620
So how do we change the time frame of the chart.

35
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.360
Well this final way here let's get it done and dusted right away.

36
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.790
It tells you which time of the chart you have opened and you can change the time frame by simply clicking

37
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.160
.

38
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:12.980
And as you can see as I click the chart changes and adjust as I adjust to the right timeframe sometimes

39
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.970
a daughter has to be loaded and you'll get this a warning message.

40
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.360
All right.

41
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.210
Well that's loaded.

42
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.010
Let's have a look at.

43
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.960
Let's have a look at the other panels.

44
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.760
So we've talked about the market watch on the bottom here.

45
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.620
We've got a tick chart.

46
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.820
If you want but that's when the market is open because it's Saturday we can see anything here but generally

47
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.280
here you can see every single tick that comes for this current pair.

48
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.340
So let's go back.

49
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.110
The navigator is an interesting one as well.

50
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.100
You can change our accounts here.

51
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.430
Once you've entered them at least once you've got some indicators here which you can drag on to a chart

52
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.630
that's for example drag around them that they're on the Try this one this one's pretty this indicator

53
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.310
as you can see right away we've got an indicator on the chart and this indicator probably will look

54
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.850
better on the black and white sorry on the green and black.

55
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.770
So it's it's a really pretty indicator there.

56
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.170
You can drag to one that we're familiar with.

57
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.100
So.

58
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:22.590
So in the trend we've got moving average we drag it onto the chart specify the width so we can see it

59
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.710
.

60
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.130
And you can see are moving averages there.

61
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.380
If you want to delete an indicator right click it and click delete indicator.

62
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.260
OK so we've got the moving average as you can see everything is pretty simple it's very easy to get

63
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.160
around here all the indicators they hear expert advisers so I wouldn't advise using these because these

64
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.210
are the default ones and they're not very good.

65
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.850
They'll just lose your money so probably don't even look in their scripts.

66
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.550
Just also not at this stage we don't need any scripts right now.

67
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.770
OK so what have you got next.

68
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.470
At the bottom you've got your current state.

69
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.830
For example any open trades will be in the trade tab exposures a new tab in the recent builds men traded

70
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.280
for.

71
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.950
So it tells you once you have open trades which currencies you're exposed to account history it's got

72
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.310
some just general basically trades that you've already conducted.

73
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.540
If you have conducted any and so on so the news alerts mailbox markets you can explore those or not

74
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.770
.

75
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.080
Not that important for your trading.

76
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.460
Maybe the journal is important because it tells you exactly what's happening on your charts and what

77
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.340
it is like if you take profits or stop losses and so on.

78
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.770
So that's maybe an important time as well.

79
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.190
All right so let's move over to the top now at the top we've got the file window file menu.

80
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.950
I don't really use that.

81
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.970
It basically doesn't have anything helpful except for open account so if you want to open an account

82
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:07.350
open in your account you can open one here or if you want to log into an account you can log in into

83
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.490
account here if you have your credentials and you have your server just basically log into account.

84
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.940
And what you're over there next the view.

85
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.710
This one might be useful for you if you're from a different country and your base your home language

86
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.890
or English you just basically use any language and they've got a big variety of big selection of languages

87
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.050
here next.

88
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.170
So in view anything else no.

89
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.270
We'll talk about all of these just now than insurge you can in certain indicators this way as well.

90
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.380
So the most recent ones I think over here.

91
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.330
And then you can pick in the same way as we just did.

92
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.140
You can pick the indicators from here.

93
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.630
He can also insert other things like lines but we also will talk about that in the panels down here

94
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.310
insert lines channels like different elements or analysis technical analysis.

95
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.520
Maybe the only one that that is useful from here is shape so if you want to insert a rectangle you can

96
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.720
and then if you double click it and then you go to properties you can change the color if you want it

97
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.620
you want to highlight something on the chart.

98
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.480
So I'll just delete that.

99
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.060
It's distracting.

100
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:30.270
So insert charts actually don't use this one because all these options are actually available here and

101
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.300
we'll talk about them tools.

102
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:39.810
This is an important one so your options your terminal options are here and you can set these up if

103
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.920
you want.

104
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:48.840
I actually don't think you need to adjust anything here maybe change your account server if you need

105
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.930
to but once again you can do that in the menu we looked at previously.

106
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.380
OK.

107
00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:01.080
And History Center that's if you want to upload history will change it.

108
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:07.320
So we're not going to look at that and again look at any of those window.

109
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:14.130
To be honest this one help can help you tell your windows like if you click if you have several windows

110
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:20.160
open and their message is click here and you click like tell windows.

111
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.550
And as you can see they're right away adjusted into nice neat fashion where you can tile them like this

112
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.760
or you can tell them whichever way you want.

113
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.970
And the Help there's always the help topics if you get stuck with a client terminal.

114
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:41.850
There there's some really good instructions on how to get around and topics that will help you find

115
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:42.440
your way.

116
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:49.290
OK so we'll finish it off today because this story is getting quite long and in the next tutorial We'll

117
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:54.230
talk about these elements of the navigation are here in the quick panels.

118
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.380
OK I I'll see you next time.

119
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.100
Until then Happy training.
