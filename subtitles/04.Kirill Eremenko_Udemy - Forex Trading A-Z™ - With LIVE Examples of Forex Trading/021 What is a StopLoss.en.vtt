00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:08.250
Stop-Loss the concept of a stop loss is very simple to take profit but it is the other way around.

2
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.460
Its opposite actually.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.140
So this is our market movement.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:21.120
We enter into by order and we can embed a stop loss with power by order so it's an additional order

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.050
in the Forex market.

6
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.550
But it is linked to our by order.

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:36.120
So basically what it means is if the price was ever to go and reach this red level or go below it then

8
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.840
the buy order has to be automatically closed.

9
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.130
So that kind of saves you the trouble of monitoring the market and always worrying and checking if the

10
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:53.580
price is going down because you put this rule into your buy order and as soon as condition is met your

11
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.760
buy order will be close.

12
00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.480
So this is the market going down against us so we would think it is going to go up but actually went

13
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.360
down and then bottom price crosses our Stop-Loss and the order gets close.

14
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.980
Of course this yields a certain loss on our account.

15
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.330
So at this stage you would ask why is a stop loss good and if it brings losses.

16
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.400
Well lets see what happens to the market.

17
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.710
Further down the track it goes a bit up and goes down goes up and then goes further down.

18
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.570
So as you can see they could have been potentially a much higher loss.

19
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.780
So this one or even this one so or even more than that.

20
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:45.540
And so its better to control your losses and exit exit according to your trading strategy and exit on

21
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.920
time rather than overweight and bear a very high loss so small losses are much better than bigger losses

22
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.560
and thats where your stop loss comes into play.

23
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:03.060
It helps you exit the market because what what we're doing in trading is we will always win in all of

24
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.610
our trades.

25
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.850
There will be loss losses.

26
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.240
Inevitably there will be losses on the card and it's all about managing those losses.

27
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.240
Managing those risks and getting out of the market on time.

28
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.370
And that's where your stop loss will help you control the losses on your account.

29
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:30.960
It's a very important feature and I highly recommend to always set a stop loss for any of your orders

30
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.490
.

31
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.490
Let's look at a stop loss for a sell order.

32
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.960
So a sell order.

33
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.470
We are anticipating a downward movement in the market.

34
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.230
We can set a stop loss which has to be above the entry price and that's because when we anticipate a

35
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.750
downward movement we will only lose if there's an upward movement.

36
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.520
So let's see what happens in the market goes against us and goes kind of in our favor.

37
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.360
But then it crosses our Stop-Loss and unfortunately there is a small loss on that account.

38
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.700
Let's see what happens the price going forward went up went even further up.

39
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.650
So if not for our stop loss we could have closed or there we could have been closed that there and there

40
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.200
would have been a much much greater loss on the column.

41
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.170
So as you can see stop losses even though they bring losses to their count but they are very very useful

42
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:37.270
and very helpful in controlling your risks and managing any potential losses on their account.

43
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.030
And so just a final note to finish off take profits and stop loss can and probably should be said together

44
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.660
.

45
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.750
As I said all I recommend always setting a stop loss and you can combine it with Fertik profit if you

46
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.080
like.

47
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.920
You can set both of them and attach them to one order.

48
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.400
Finally a word of caution.

49
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:08.880
Sometimes when the market volatility is very very high for example during market news the broker.

50
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.450
Your broker may not be able to execute just applause.

51
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:19.680
It is a very rare condition but sometimes happens when there is just basically no price no takers at

52
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.650
just Stop-Loss level or take profit level.

53
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.500
And what will happen then is a massive slippage can happen.

54
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.940
And even though how a stop loss its not a 100 percent guarantee that the order will be close is too

55
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.400
close.

56
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.630
Its probably like 90 95 percent guarantee but sometimes it does happen that an order can slip through

57
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.820
.

58
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.980
Thats an inherent risk of the Forex market.

59
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:50.220
I have to be aware of that and thats why I highly recommend having a look at my tutorials on fundamental

60
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:57.150
trading and seeing how to kind of understand when theres market movements so you dont you avoid trading

61
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.930
at those time.

62
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.950
Thats what I personally do.

63
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.320
I kind of stay out of the market when I know theres going to be massive movement
