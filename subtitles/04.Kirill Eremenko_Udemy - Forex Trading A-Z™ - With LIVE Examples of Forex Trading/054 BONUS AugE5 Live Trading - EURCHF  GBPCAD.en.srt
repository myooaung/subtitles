1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,090
Hey guys curial here I wonder how you're going with the chorus.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,120
Hope you're enjoying it so far.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,920
You're through the live testing results.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,660
And I wanted to post a quick update.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:19,500
So today's Monday the 24th of August 2015 it's 1:30 p.m. in Brisbane Australia and carga I'm just testing

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,630
out a broker which I'm kind of interested in checking out and I am I've created a few orders today morning

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,010
just just to see what's going on in the market and so on.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:38,520
And I was actually going to share with you another triangle pattern that I found I really I really think

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,050
that they're very powerful and as you saw from the previous videos of the life testing we've had some

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,810
good results.

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,090
And today once again I just wanted to show you what happened here so this is the euro Frank.

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,080
And so as you can see this is triangled switched back to the bars and you can see how nicely it's forming

13
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,650
this is the five minute time frame I could.

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,870
First time I spoke it was like an hour timeframe when you whenever you see on the hour each time things

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,290
turn from something going on like that.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,110
So right now the euro currency pairs are going up.

17
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,620
So euros going up all across the board.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:15,870
And also you can see the franc currency pairs while Dola franc is going down meaning that franc is going

19
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,400
up right.

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,340
So let's buy another one British pound of Swiss franc is going down.

21
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,760
So both.

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,630
What does that tell us that tells us that both the franc is is getting stronger and the euro is getting

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,640
stronger so they I moved onto the euro franc currency pair and I like because they're both getting stronger

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,380
they're kind of battling It's like I haven't made this go into myself like Battle Of The Titans for

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,320
today anyway.

26
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,440
They started the strong strong day both him and that's why you can see like this flat movement because

27
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,300
one is going very strong against other currency pairs and the other is going very strong against other

28
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:48,950
currency pairs.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,740
And it's for them it's like they're fighting for the first place you can say it that way.

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,170
And when you see something like this on a high timeframe you move down slowly and you see that it's

31
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,520
actually it's not just the flat it's actually a triangle that's forming here.

32
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:09,720
And once I saw that I was like yep I'm in I'm going to get into a get in on this and once again this

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,750
is just because I'm testing out the broker I don't want to you know commit to a full throttle trading

34
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,730
strategy or anything that this is I'm just you know kind of having fun but this is a real real accounting

35
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:20,850
.

36
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:27,600
Just to clarify I've got 2000 Australian dollars and today I made 55 Australian dollars just by testing

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,210
a broker.

38
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,880
So I don't really.

39
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,750
This is test funds this is this is not money that I'm like relying on or or battling for oil or you

40
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,910
know working to get this is just just to test it out anyway.

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:49,110
So so the triangle and decided to put as I advised or not advise I don't advise as I showed you in the

42
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:55,310
course as I normally do I put two orders so one by stop you can see row here.

43
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,030
So I'll just put a line through it.

44
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,240
That's a by stop and the cell stop was over here you can see it on the chart because it's gone.

45
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,770
But let's see what happens if I drag it on.

46
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,230
So there's a cell stop and just delete that.

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,790
That's where I put the cell stop.

48
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,170
And you can see where I put it.

49
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,260
So this vertical line I'm going to UPS that's not a vertical line.

50
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,200
Gonna fix this one up.

51
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:24,130
This is an unplanned tutorial for this course so excuse me if it's a bit ad hoc.

52
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:31,920
OK so I've got the vertical line here and let's make it a bit wider.

53
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:41,460
OK so this is where I placed both the tray the cell stop and by stop so I placed them at this point

54
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,910
in time and was well according to the server time.

55
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,680
By the way this broker doesn't have servers and Australia has servers in America.

56
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,210
Whole different story anyway.

57
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,590
So I pray a place by stop and say stop over here as you can see like triangle.

58
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,470
It just works there.

59
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,760
It's too strong currency at the moment something is going to happen and it happened.

60
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,190
And where did I place my take profit.

61
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,180
You see this line over here.

62
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,790
This is how I measured the base just like we discussed in the course so if I just move this back just

63
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:17,880
remember that we're where the take profit was it was hit exactly at the top of this movement how do

64
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,200
we get the top of the movement.

65
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,700
Well look this is how I got this line in the first place.

66
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,910
I measured the base of my triangle right.

67
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,230
So somewhere like that.

68
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,410
And then I placed it so I thought OK maybe it won't shoot out right away.

69
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:36,360
So from here it won't shoot out like immediately you'll probably shoot out in like a couple of bars

70
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,140
at least.

71
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,200
So then I put the line where I thought it would shoot out.

72
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,000
Right.

73
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,230
And then I put the tape proffered just below half of the base and that's exactly what we discussed the

74
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,510
course that you place your take profit at around half the size of the base of the triangle as you can

75
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,050
see worked perfectly here like the take profit closed.

76
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,820
And then the price turned around.

77
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,370
Well if you look at the bars there was a bit of a movement more upwards right but not that much more

78
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,310
and you don't want to run after these little things.

79
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,780
And the other point is that it didn't go all the whole base of the triangle it just went past half the

80
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,300
base and then turned around.

81
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,320
And so yeah that's that's the triangle Paran.

82
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,290
What else that I did today.

83
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,950
There was a good trade over here somewhere.

84
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,490
This one.

85
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,910
No it was on Gimme a second.

86
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,160
It was see everyone got common here Test 0 2 test 0 5.

87
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,230
Was it through your frank.

88
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,750
No it was the British Canadian.

89
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,740
There we go.

90
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,000
So here was a good trade.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,260
So what can we see here.

92
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,920
I'm going to just switch this grid office so you can see more.

93
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,370
OK.

94
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,650
So here what happened was I don't usually trade against the trend.

95
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,230
Right.

96
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,630
But what you could see here was a strong trend all the way.

97
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,940
And then I just opened the chart I could see this candle forming.

98
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,880
So this is something we haven't discussed in the course.

99
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:08,600
But you know it's another thing you see this candle shooting upwards very quickly so that's a point

100
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,880
that I saw it form extremely quickly as it just went bam very fast upwards.

101
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,720
What happens in these situations if it's not if it's not some news or something that's forcing the market

102
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,510
to go and that's the end is going to keep going that way.

103
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:28,760
It was just like a spontaneous maybe a session opened or you know a company announced it's that it or

104
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:34,230
a bank is having like not a major but a minor intervention or something is happening in the world.

105
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:41,390
Some Joe Joe demographical cataclysm or something something happened very quickly but it's not major

106
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:41,590
.

107
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,940
Right.

108
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,470
So I didn't hear anything on the news.

109
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,580
I know it's not a Friday so I don't think that there's something major going.

110
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,790
What usually happens after that is the currency traces a little bit.

111
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:56,250
So people go in and then what happens people see this movement is going fast if I put the tick volume

112
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:03,960
back on here you see you see the tick volume here in Forex tick volume is basically it's not the same

113
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,630
as volume on the stock market or anything is just how many ticks there were in this bar like how many

114
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,210
times did the price change in this bar.

115
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:18,030
And so there was there's a lot of volume so people will like it was moving very quickly and people could

116
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,410
see that.

117
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:24,180
And what the traders do especially know these traders they try to jump onto that movement they try to

118
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,100
get on to all this that the bars are going fast upwards.

119
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,000
You know I got I got to get in to get in on this.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,270
I'm going to miss out and never do that.

121
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,010
That's that's not good.

122
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,530
If you miss the train you've missed the train so you can see here like it took a couple of minutes this

123
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,490
is the minute time frame maybe like half an hour or something but it was going very quickly like in

124
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,660
a minute here you can see it when what 13 pips.

125
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,070
And then like very quick its just.

126
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,340
This is a Monday morning.

127
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,860
This is just the Asia trading session.

128
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,390
We talked about trading sessions also in this course as well.

129
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,750
And then at the start.

130
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,730
So you know that it shouldn't be very quick it should be kind of like lazy and slow and it's like going

131
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,540
very quick very quick.

132
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:08,160
People are trying to jump onto this movement and what happens the the late traders they jump in over

133
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,850
here and that's when the smart traders start selling like the traders that are late.

134
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,400
They want to buy and that's when the smart traders are selling off this movement that they got from

135
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,600
from the bottom to the top and now they're getting out of the market.

136
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,290
So there's a lot of currency being so British pound.

137
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,490
There's a little British pound being released into the market and all the late traders they're buying

138
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,760
it while the traders came in early they just get rid of the currency and because there's so much currency

139
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,910
excess currency the price is going down and that's when you jump in like it doesn't always happen.

140
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,960
But if you can see that it's happening that this exact scenario is happening then in this case what

141
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:52,050
I did is I jumped in and I just you know capitalized on that movement back like kind of little retracement

142
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:58,640
that happens after quick movements like that quick unexpected and unexplained movements like that and

143
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,050
that's it.

144
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,520
And and then I got out.

145
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,220
I even put a stop order by limit order some way here.

146
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,000
So as you can see it somewhere here by a limit there.

147
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,760
So I was expecting no drag on torture.

148
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:15,510
I was expecting the price to turn around so I knew that it's against the trade trend it's not going

149
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,510
to last forever.

150
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,540
This downward movement is going to keep going up.

151
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,240
Right.

152
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,660
So I put a limit.

153
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,980
And I said OK so if it if this retracement goes through a little bit more then I'll get in on a buy

154
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,270
but it just didn't didn't trigger my limit.

155
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,560
So you can see the price crossed here.

156
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,180
But as you know this is the bid price that's illustrated and by orders get opened at the ask price and

157
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,200
ask price was just about I could see it.

158
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,220
I could see it here and then just it went away and then I was like OK now I'm I don't want to get in

159
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,810
here it's a bit too late because if I got in here on a board I would have to sit through all of this

160
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,340
and not not not good especially if I'm just testing these things out.

161
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,150
So that's the two trading trades that I did today too I did a couple more but those are the two most

162
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,250
interesting ones.

163
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,920
There's another big one somewhere or big you know quotation marks big.

164
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:13,320
ahm no those those are the two bigger ones because I went I went in like zero point to 5 watts and 0.2

165
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,300
Watts anyway.

166
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,800
Hope you enjoyed this.

167
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,010
And my main focus of course was triangle parent.

168
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,680
That it does work.

169
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:30,080
So keep keep you know maybe learning the triangle parent and researching it more and heads up.

170
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:38,280
I'm testing out this broker and maybe maybe just maybe I might update my preferred brokers this soon

171
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,840
and I will let you know if that happens.

172
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:48,960
And until next time enjoy the course and trade well trade safe trade fun and happy trading.

173
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,180
I look forward to seeing you later on.
