00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.970
Hello this is Carol from for ex-beau dot com.

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.200
And welcome back to the course and for extruding it is the Torah.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.270
We will talk about bulls and bears and buying and selling on the forex market.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.400
Perhaps by now you've already heard about the two creatures that dominate the 4 X market and these are

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.420
the bulls and the bears.

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.060
So the bulls stand for forex traders who invest in the growth of a currency pair.

7
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.730
He will give an example of the British pound dollar in an upward trend.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:38.160
And in this case the Bulls would be active and they would be buying this currency pair.

9
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.040
And then in order to close that letter and profit from the growth in price and in a minute we'll discuss

10
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.830
the mechanics behind that bears or people who invest in the decline of a currency pair.

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.720
And this is an example of the euro dollar in a downward trend.

12
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.450
Here the bears would profit from selling this currency pair.

13
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.310
The terms bulls and bears have historical background and they were first introduced a long time ago

14
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.790
in the stock market.

15
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.560
The choice of animals has quite a lot to do with the way they attack a bull would fling up its opponent

16
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.570
into the air and that is similar to how currency pairs move upwards.

17
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.440
A bear would generally attack by using its paws to drag somebody down and that's similar to how currency

18
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.160
pairs move downwards.

19
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.680
There is a bit of a difference between the Forex market and the stock market and that is because the

20
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:44.160
stock market the way it's formed people associate bears with kind of negativity or pessimistic approach

21
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.330
since the Bears are selling.

22
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.710
And when you sell a stock you think that the company is going to underperform is going to fail and you

23
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.570
want to short sell that stock.

24
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.680
I will talk about short selling in one of the future tutorials.

25
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.800
But generally that's a pessimistic kind of approach whereas bulls are happy creatures that are aggressive

26
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.630
that look forward to something growing and becoming more valuable like a stock for example.

27
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.840
But on the forex market that is very different.

28
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.980
Pools are still the same.

29
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.940
They're looking for something to grow.

30
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.810
Bears are not pessimistic bears just invest in the decline of a currency but there is no actual company

31
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.750
behind this currency it's not a stock.

32
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.080
So by investing in the decline of the euro dollar are you just saying that the euro will drop but the

33
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.090
U.S. dollar will grow soon in a way you're actually investing into the growth of the U.S. dollar.

34
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.980
So that's something to remember that bears are not bad.

35
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.460
Anybody can bear a bear.

36
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.950
And moreover most traders will sometimes be a bull and sometimes be a bear.

37
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.570
So you can buy in one case and sell in another case depending on what your analysis tells you.

38
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.070
And we'll talk more about that in the Forex analysis section of this course.

39
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.590
All right.

40
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.470
Moving on today we will talk about bulls and buying on the forex market.

41
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.260
Let's look at a British pound dollar example.

42
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.940
And here we can see an upward trend.

43
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:24.480
Let's assume that a bull trader bought at that point in time marked by the cross and the transaction

44
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.060
was conducted at a quarter price of one point forty four 0 0 for the British banjo's dollar currency

45
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.500
.

46
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.350
As we recall from one of the previous tutorials.

47
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:47.130
This means that at that point in time every single British pound was worth one point one American dollar

48
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.260
and 44 American cents.

49
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.090
Then let's assume that the trainer waited for some time and closed his transaction had the price marked

50
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.610
by the second cross and the quoted price at the time was 1.5 9 5 0.

51
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:12.810
So this bull trader knows what he's doing and he made money through this transaction on the forex market

52
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.980
.

53
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.330
Let's understand how exactly that happened.

54
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.540
Let's look at the mechanics behind it.

55
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:27.660
So let's assume that the bullish trader had 1000 U.S. dollars to invest which he put into the British

56
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.510
pound.

57
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.270
And he quoted price of one point forty four 0 0.

58
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.810
Now as we did previously Let's simplify this example by replacing the British pound with apples because

59
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.520
apples are also tangible we can hold them them measure them weigh them up and we can always replace

60
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.060
them base currency with apples to simplify things.

61
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.550
So no our example says that the trader had $1000 which he invested in two apples at the price of $1

62
00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.700
.

63
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.310
Forty four cents per apple.

64
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.420
This means that he bought six hundred ninety four apples.

65
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:15.870
Next he waited a certain number of days until the price for apples grew to 1.5 9 5 0 0 dollars per apple

66
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.130
.

67
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.780
And at this point in time he still has 694 apples.

68
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.840
What he did with these apples next is he's sold them at the new price and in return he got one thousand

69
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.510
one hundred and seven dollars.

70
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.970
So as you can see he started with $1000 and now he has 1000 $107.

71
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:48.140
So if we break the final amount up we can see that $1000 is the starting amount on his account and one

72
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.540
hundred and seven dollars is the profit that he made.

73
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:59.220
Now moving back to the British pound we can see that nothing changes if we replace Apple's back with

74
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.250
the British pound trading invested a thousand dollars into the British pound.

75
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.510
He goes 694 pounds.

76
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.980
Then he sold them at a higher price got 1107 dollars back.

77
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.880
And that is his profit $107.

78
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.690
So he got his 1000 back and he's got $170 extra on top of that.

79
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.700
So in Forex the first reaction is called buying the second transaction is called closing.

80
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:35.340
So even though he actually sells the British pound for dollars because this is part the second part

81
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:43.110
of a buying transaction or this whole one and transaction it is in Forex we call it closing rather than

82
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.100
selling so that we don't confuse things.

83
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.450
So you're open to the action by buying and then you close that transaction.

84
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:58.500
So these are the mechanics behind a bullish transaction on the Fox market in the next tutorial we will

85
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.700
talk about short selling on the 4 x market and the mechanics behind that.

86
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.250
And further down the track and this course in one of the tutorials we will talk about leverage and I

87
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:15.480
will show you how this trader could have made much more profit using leverage even with the same starting

88
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.360
deposit of $1000.

89
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.050
Thank you for your attention today.

90
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.600
I look forward to seeing you next time.

91
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.270
And until then happy trading.
