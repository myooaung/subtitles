00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:10.620
So leverage as we discussed in order to buy or sell one lot of Eurodollar you need 123 2228 American

2
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.860
dollars on your account which is a lot of money.

3
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:22.050
But even in order to trade with zero point one lots you need twelve thousand American dollars and in

4
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.450
order to conduct a small transaction possible micro Laud's zero point zero one lots.

5
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.910
You still need a thousand two hundred dollars on your account which is a lot of money.

6
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.510
And what happens if we can't afford to have an account of that size or we're just not ready yet.

7
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.500
We are practicing and we don't want to invest that much money into the Forex market.

8
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.030
How do we trade them.

9
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.290
Well this is where leverage comes into play.

10
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.430
The concept of leverage has a lot of negative sentiment around it and people kind of think that it's

11
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.330
bad for your dangerous which is completely not true and in this and the next tutorial we will disprove

12
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.200
those fears.

13
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.460
So what happens with leverage is your broker will actually lend you money in order to help you conduct

14
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.620
transactions on the 4 X market.

15
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.600
So in this picture your money is on the right and the money the brokerage is on the left.

16
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.300
So let's have a look at a particular example.

17
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.980
For instance your balance is $500.

18
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.450
And you want to conduct a transaction with the volume of 0.1 lots on the euro dollar currency.

19
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.200
So you require 12000 322 American dollars to conduct this transaction.

20
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.530
Obviously your balance is insufficient at this stage but with leverage if your leverage is a one to

21
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.000
100 then your broker will actually only require you to have 1 percent of that money and the broker will

22
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.610
lend you 99 percent of the required amount.

23
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.550
So in this case your broker will lend you twelve thousand one hundred ninety nine dollars so you're

24
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.230
borrowing 99 percent of the required amount.

25
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.460
All you have to ask is $123 of your own money.

26
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.830
So that is 1 percent of the transaction.

27
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.230
And that is much more affordable with your balance of power $100.

28
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.810
And in this case you can not conduct this transaction and participate in the Forex market either buying

29
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.710
or selling of your dollar.

30
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.040
So that's how leverage works.

31
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.230
But why would the broker do this.

32
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.780
Why would the broker Ling-Ju money.

33
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.800
Well we'll find to find that out.

34
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.910
We have to talk about equity in margin and we'll do that in next Tauriel
