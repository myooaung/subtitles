00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello this is Kirill from Forex boat dot com.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:09,150
And welcome back to the course and forex trading today we're going to talk about the non-farm payrolls

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,990
and unemployment rate for the U.S. as you can see I've got the calendar open it's calendar open.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,960
I've got the chart behind me.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,290
And as you can see already now the price in your dollar is tumbling down.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,330
And I'll just quickly bring this chart out.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,700
The first five she counted back up.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:33,180
And if we update these news elements you'll see that they have been just released.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,890
The time is 8:29 am and the price is tumbling down for the Eurodollar.

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,240
What does that mean.

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,450
The Under the non-farm was positive for the U.S dollar.

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,360
The unemployment rate didn't really change.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,190
So that means good news for the dollar and that means bad news for the Euro this is a Eurodollar M5

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,540
chart.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:01,440
And as you can see we've got a massive bar going down right now it is exactly 8:30 in New York time

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,520
.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,550
The news has just come out.

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,750
And what we can see is an incredible dip in prices.

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,920
This is December 2014.

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,610
And what is happening is just crazy.

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,350
This is a massive massive drop.

22
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,020
What how much pips do we have here.

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,680
That's about 70 pips in less than five minutes.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,280
Seventy Pip movement in less than five minutes.

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,570
And this is happening right in front of your eyes so we can zoom in a little bit more.

26
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,950
This is a massive candle as you can see this is not something you see often.

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,610
This is the first Friday of December 2014.

28
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,580
The U.S. have just released non-farm and unemployment.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,850
As you can see the market was waiting for this.

30
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,150
There was a consolidation over here.

31
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:53,010
And as the news came out right now the market has already dipped about 70 pips.

32
00:01:53,010 --> 00:02:00,740
Now it's really 70 72 73 pips all in the space of minutes so let's just switch to one chart quickly

33
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,050
.

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,120
You can see this wall.

35
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,140
This all happened in the space of one minute.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,730
And this is this is why trading the news can be profitable but can be very volatile as well.

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,740
We didn't conduct any trades because I find it very risky.

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,660
But some people profit from movements like this.

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,060
This is incredible.

40
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,820
As you saw the price went down in one minute sixty five pips and then kept going and now is going back

41
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,130
up.

42
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,510
That's something that naturally happens sometimes when the price goes down.

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,250
Some traders will try to push it back up at the bottom.

44
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,920
You never know what we're how we'll go afterwards.

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,590
But as you can see that is one incredible move and you don't often see things like this.

46
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,990
But if you do want to see them look for them on the first Friday of every month.

47
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:59,050
So let's go back to the calendar and just reconcile so we've got a lot of news coming out at 8:30.

48
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:07,020
It was 29 when I opened the calendar so I can just refresh this page now to see what's happened.

49
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:13,200
So it's 8:32 but you just have to click this button again because it hasn't come through exactly yet

50
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,010
as you can see the prices going back up right now.

51
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,710
So once again unemployment rate hasn't changed and that just doesn't mean anything.

52
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:29,560
But the non-farm employment change so they were expecting a rise of about 230 1000.

53
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,570
It actually rose by three hundred and twenty one thousand.

54
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,650
And the previous actual was actually worse than the forecast.

55
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,080
This actual is much better than the forecast.

56
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:50,430
So this is nearly by 100000 better so that's nearly by 50 percent better than the because it's actually

57
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,040
less than 50 percent but much better than the forecasted value.

58
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,210
And that's why the U.S. That's very good for the U.S. as you can see here actually green forecasts good

59
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,200
for currency.

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,050
So that's really good for the U.S. dollar.

61
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,160
And that's why the euro dollar tumbled down.

62
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,930
Meaning that the U.S. dollar got stronger as compared to the euro dollar.

63
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,380
And what do we see here.

64
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,550
The price is going went down went up a bit and now it's going back down again.

65
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:29,730
And that's one of those just standard situations when some traders try to push it up and then just keeps

66
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,530
going down.

67
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,630
So we'll keep this chart open.

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,790
And right now what I'll do is I'll open up another chart.

69
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,930
Let's look at the dollar yen.

70
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,310
As you can see here we've also got a massive spike here that's the one on the chart if we look at the

71
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,530
five minute chart you'll see a massive spike here as well.

72
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,700
So let me just get rid of this grid.

73
00:04:52,940 --> 00:05:00,960
So a massive boost in the dollar yen going up Eurodollar still going down.

74
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,230
Let's look at another one.

75
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,120
As you can see the markets are going crazy if you look at the market watch on the left.

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,400
Prices are changing very rapidly.

77
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,900
That's also because the euro dollar.

78
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,830
The euro U.S. markets have just opened up and this news came out at the same time.

79
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:26,130
So lots of factors coming together on a Friday well for me it's Friday night for the U.S. It's Friday

80
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,320
morning in early December 2014.

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,940
Also it's more significant because this is the last time that non-farm and unemployment are released

82
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:42,030
for the year because it's December and that adds to the mix as well.

83
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:48,930
So let's look at dollar Canadian for instance and we'll switch to five right away or even Let's look

84
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,310
at them one chart see what happened here.

85
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,890
Right now this is great.

86
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,120
Get rid of it.

87
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,900
Maybe hit the grid.

88
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:08,370
What do we see here we see a massive increase so this is happening virtually on every currency pair

89
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:16,570
that has the U.S. dollar currency in involved.

90
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,820
So there was a massive increase here massive increase here massive drop here and it just keeps on dropping

91
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,600
as you can see so we can zoom out just look at the magnitude of these movements.

92
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,910
This is already 73 pips in about the space of five minutes.

93
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:40,750
So you can earn massive amounts of money here if you choose to trade fundamental analysis.

94
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:41,430
All right.

95
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,410
So that's pretty much it for today.

96
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,610
Just wanted to mention that.

97
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:55,410
Personally I try to avoid situations like this because if my forex robot or my technical analysis has

98
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:01,410
a certain pattern it's looking for things like this can actually really skew the results.

99
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:08,790
So using the 4 x calendar can be also beneficial for those who use technical analysis because it will

100
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,700
allow you to avoid situations like this.

101
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,190
All right so we'll finish up this Tauriel on that.

102
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,170
Look out for every first Friday of every month.

103
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,400
Very important day because these two pieces of news are released.

104
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,260
Thanks for attention and I'll look forward to seeing you next time.
