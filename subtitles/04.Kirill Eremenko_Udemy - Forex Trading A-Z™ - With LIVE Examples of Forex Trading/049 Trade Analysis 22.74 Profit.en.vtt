00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.950
Hello welcome back.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.930
It has been just over 20 hours since we opened our Australian dollar Canadian dollar.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.040
By order and we have a result the buy order was closed at a profit and we can see this from the card

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.750
history tab down here.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.200
As you can see the green indicates that the order was closed at take profit and this single order brought

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.390
us $22 and seventy four cents of real money from the Forex market.

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.170
So congratulations on that.

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.690
Right now our account is sitting at a total of one hundred nineteen dollars and 20 cents profit.

9
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.780
And as you recall we started off with simply $500 an account.

10
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.920
So if I bring up the calculator now I would divide $100 $19 and 20 cents by 500.

11
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:57.940
We'll see that in total we have earned over 23 percent of profit just through these three trades.

12
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.840
That's an incredible result.

13
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:10.090
It is a result of very precise entries and exits and very calm very well calculated risks.

14
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.060
So we'll talk more about that in the summary for the section and philologists quickly have a look at

15
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.940
how this order played out and what we can learn from this particular trade that we conducted yesterday

16
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.460
.

17
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:33.570
So as usual I'm going to drag the order onto the chart so we can see it there and I'm going to change

18
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.710
the charter bar chart so we can see things a bit better.

19
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.500
And if we go zoom in a little bit we can see here that the order was open where the red line is and

20
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.400
that that's where we entered the position.

21
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.940
Then from there the market went a little bit down kind of crossed over this channel line the bottom

22
00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:02.490
of the the bottom border of the channel hit the moving average trusted a bit tested it and then went

23
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.460
back up slowly to where it's supposed to go.

24
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:15.150
So a couple learnings from this particular example or from this particular order the first one and one

25
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.240
of the most important ones is that it's really good that we set the stop loss in this position where

26
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.350
we did.

27
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.280
And by that I mean that a lot of the time traders tend to set the stop loss right under the channel

28
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.510
.

29
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.860
Right.

30
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.050
Like right over here or maybe over here as you can see in this case it wouldn't have worked.

31
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.470
The market tends to test resistance lines and boards of channels.

32
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.400
And by that I mean that it it can approach them and even go through them a little bit and then go back

33
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.580
.

34
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.790
So finding a good position for a stop loss is a crucial part of your trading in this case.

35
00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.130
I'll remind you that we looked at the psychological level of 95 and that was protecting our Stop-Loss

36
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.620
So we set our stop loss below that level.

37
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.950
Also definitely has to be below this bottom border of the channel.

38
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.330
Another interesting thing about the stop loss is and this is something I didn't mention yesterday.

39
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.290
But it's good to analyze it today.

40
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.060
As you can see the stop loss was also protected by the moving average.

41
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:33.300
So not only the ninety five not only the channel border and the ninety five five psychological resistance

42
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.180
level was protecting or protecting a stop loss but also the moving average was.

43
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.530
And so this is a 96 moving a simple moving average and 96.

44
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.150
There's 24 hours in a day.

45
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.970
And if you multiply 24 by that by four you'll get 96 So this is this moving average kind of represents

46
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.970
the average over four days the average on the Areli time frame over four days.

47
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.610
And as you can see in this particular case the moving average works really well.

48
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.700
The price bounced off the moving average here then bounced off the moving average of it here again.

49
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.730
Then bounced off the moving average here again.

50
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.880
And yesterday after we conducted our trade the price also once again bounced off the moving average

51
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.150
.

52
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:33.540
And that's a very good example of how you can use a moving average as a moving or rolling resistance

53
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.010
line.

54
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.590
So in this case that does another good thing for where we set our stop loss.

55
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:50.370
And finally if we look here at the take profit what happened here is the price has reached the take

56
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.150
profit which is great but it has not yet reached the top border of the channel so there is a potential

57
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.880
for the price to keep going and maybe that will happen.

58
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:07.440
But if you recall the way we set this stock take profit was it had to be below the important psychological

59
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:14.760
level of zero point ninety six which is here which I'm currently showing with the Course or so this

60
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:23.010
is also a very crucial part of your trading to say to take profits at strategic levels like below or

61
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.700
above.

62
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.450
In this case we want we know that the traders will be hesitant to cross the 0.26 line.

63
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:38.130
And therefore statistically it is it kind of reduces your chances of profit if you set your take profit

64
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.270
above this level.

65
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.250
So sometimes it is worth being a bit more conservative and setting.

66
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:51.030
You take profits below these levels so being kind of rather than just going for big bucks being more

67
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.920
strategic about your trading.

68
00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:02.100
So those are kind of the learnings from this example and from this particular trade and I look forward

69
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.600
to seeing in the next tutorial.

70
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.130
Until then happy trading
