00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
generally seizures in those last from 30 seconds to two minutes,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.330
but in some cases may last for an extended duration as well.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.410
This can occur because of the following reasons.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.310
Sometimes senior,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.870
those developed brain tumors that may put pressure on their brains,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.050
leading to seizures.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.650
An injury to the brain can also cause seizures in the door.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.100
If it or low has kidney disease or kidney failure,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.870
Toxins build up in his bloodstream and can't be excreted.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.350
This build up of toxins in the kidneys can cause seizures in him.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.620
Similarly,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.420
if you suffer from liver disease,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.800
liver failure that also can lead to seizures.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.430
Hypothyroidism,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.000
an under active thyroid gland can slow down the metabolism off your dog,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.750
and that's leading to seizures.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.130
In hyperglycemia,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.580
blood sugar level decreases due to which brain doesn't get sufficient supply of glucose.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.540
In order to function properly,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.950
it may result in seizures in your pooch.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.420
This can also occur due to the overdose off insulin in a diabetic dog.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.370
Adverse reaction to certain medications can cause seizures as well.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.020
Further exposure to certain environmental toxins like poisonous pesticides,

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.000
insecticides,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.910
antifreeze,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.410
agents,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.630
etcetera can potentially cause seizures as well.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.250
Adverse reaction toe food allergies or synthetic chemicals.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.240
Emulsifiers,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.120
preservatives,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.150
president back foods can also be a reason for seizures in dogs.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.280
Advanced Cushing's disease can occur because off legions in pituitary gland and when the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.020
size of the tumors increase,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.580
that can put extrapolation on the brain.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.100
That,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.590
in turn,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.050
can lead to seizures.
