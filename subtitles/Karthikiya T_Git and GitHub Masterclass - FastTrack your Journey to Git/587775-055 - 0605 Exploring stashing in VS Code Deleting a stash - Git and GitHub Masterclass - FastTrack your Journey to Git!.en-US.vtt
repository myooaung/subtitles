00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Now let us take a
look at how we can

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.650
perform stashing
Visual Studio Code.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.810
And once again,
for this purpose,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.580
I brought the project
back to what it

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.755
was at the beginning
of this chapter.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:13.890
And we currently have
no stashes whatsoever.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.000
Let us go ahead and make edits
in couple of these files.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.410
May add a line of text like
so an admin dot TXT file.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.500
And let me do the same
in inventory dot TXT

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.310
file, saved the file.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.760
Let's go to Source Control.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.125
Click on these three dots

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:42.830
and you see the option
to perform stash.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.840
So here you find a routine we've

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.180
learned so far in this chapter.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.354
We can perform Stash.

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:52.910
Stash, which also
includes untracked files.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.940
We can apply latest stash.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.245
This is as good as we're running
git stash apply command.

00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:03.620
Or we can choose this option
that says apply stash.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.670
And then we get to choose the
one of the saved stashes.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.135
Let's go ahead and
perform stashing.

00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:14.015
It is asking us to
enter a message,

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:23.490
let Center or
something, hit Enter.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.555
So this must have
saved how changes.

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:33.090
1 second, Let's go to stash.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.725
We can click on
Apply letters stash,

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:40.129
or we can choose this option
that says a plus stash.

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:42.035
And then we get to choose

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:44.735
the stash that we
would like to apply.

00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:46.610
Currently, we just
have one stash

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.305
and say it is getting displayed.

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:50.510
If we had list of stashes,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.430
those would be
displayed as well.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.470
Let me click on this.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.330
And as you can see,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.110
changes for now applied
in both these files.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.255
Let's see what other
options we have.

00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:09.350
We also have the option
to pop the latest stash,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.365
pop a specific stash.

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:17.105
Or we can even drop this dash
or drop all the stashes.

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:21.750
Essentially drop would
mean deleting a stash.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.029
This is similar to running
the command git stash drop.

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.105
And then you're going to
specify this dash ID.

00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:39.320
Or you can just say
git stash, clear.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.510
And this would delete
all the stashes.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.990
We can either do it from

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.930
here or we can also
run the command.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.460
Let me run the command. Now.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.430
If I do git stash list,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.650
you're not going to
see anything because

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.050
we have just deleted everything.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.020
But that's how you
use stashing in

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.080
Visual Studio Code.
I'll see you next.
