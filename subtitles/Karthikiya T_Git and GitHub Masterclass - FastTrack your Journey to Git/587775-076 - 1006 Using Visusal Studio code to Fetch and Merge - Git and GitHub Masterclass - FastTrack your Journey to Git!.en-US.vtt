00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.850
Okay, let us see
how we can perform

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.830
fetch and basically written

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.030
what we've learned so far in

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.135
this chapter in
Visual Studio Code.

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:11.220
First of all, make
sure that you have

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.750
the project opened up.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.220
If you don't see
your project here,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.955
go to File menu and
click on Open Folder.

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:22.170
Choose your project. And
you should be good to go.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.000
Let us switch to
source control section

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.220
to perform git-fetch.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.290
Click on this icon.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.710
And then you see
bunch of options.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.260
Go to pull, push section,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.295
and then you see the option
to fetch the changes.

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:43.610
Once you click on it
for the first time,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.700
you might get a
prompt asking you if

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.260
you'd like Visual Studio Code

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.480
to do that automatically
every time,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.015
you can actually say yes to it,

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:56.930
because git-fetch is
considered safe operation.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.580
And since it's not going to have

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.815
an implication on your
working directory,

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:02.780
you can perform it safely

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.000
without having to
worry about anything.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.740
And once you do that,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.960
you see a status here.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.180
In my case, I see

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.700
one and then down arrow
0, and then apparel.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.650
I'm not sure if you're
able to see this.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.590
But one down arrow would mean

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.355
that we have additional
commits in remote repository,

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:29.000
which can be merged into
a local depository.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.755
0 or pyro means

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:32.630
that we don't have any
additional commitment or

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.300
local depository that we need to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.080
upload our push to the
remote repository.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.420
We're going to talk about how
we can push our changes to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.975
the remote repository
in upcoming lectures.

00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:46.700
Once you have that,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.110
let us say that you have
decided to perform much.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.155
We're going to use this
third party plugin for that.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:55.970
And here you can see that

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.480
the origin new feature
branch is pointing to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.600
this commit and our
local new feature branch

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.810
is pointing to this
particular commit.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.095
Now guess what? I need to merge

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:11.375
these two branches to have

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.660
all the remote changes
in my working directory.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.250
So in Visual Studio Code,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.035
I need to right-click
on the branch

00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:19.835
which I want to merge.

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:22.100
And then you see this option.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.605
Merge into current branch,

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:26.120
our current branches, new

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.520
feature branch as
you can see here.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.310
So let's click on it.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.890
By the way, to explain things
that have brought back

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.045
the project back to how
it was before merging.

00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:40.010
So right-click on it.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.290
Magenta current branch.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.720
We've already talked
about this prompt.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.220
It's exact same prompt.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.020
Nothing different.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.660
But we don't want to create
a new comment though.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.235
And now if you go to
the working tree,

00:02:58.235 --> 00:03:00.720
you see this file,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.919
which is what we're expecting.
