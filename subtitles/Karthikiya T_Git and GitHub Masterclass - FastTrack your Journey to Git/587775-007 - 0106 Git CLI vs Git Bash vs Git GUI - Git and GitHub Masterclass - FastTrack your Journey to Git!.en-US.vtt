00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.465
There are basically three ways
we can interact with Git.

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:04.860
We can either use gets

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.770
CMD or Git Bash or get GUI
or graphical user interface.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.870
Gets CMV is nothing but

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.695
the Windows command processor
we use to run git commands.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:18.510
In fact, we had already
taken a look at

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.285
an example of the same
in our previous lecture,

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:24.345
where we were testing the
installation of getting.

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:28.740
The other option we have
is to use Git Bash,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.920
which is a tool we had
installed along with Git.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.500
Git Bash is similar to
Windows command processor,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.115
except that we can use

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:40.385
standard Linux commands
to interact with good.

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:42.425
This will come in handy,

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:44.105
especially if you're coming from

00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:46.220
Linux background where you're

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.140
used to running Linux commands.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.030
And now let's say that you are

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.145
working from Windows
operating system.

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:54.770
You don't have to take that
additional learning curve to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.670
understand Windows command in
order to interact with Git.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.640
For example, in order to
list down all the files in

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.120
a particular folder inside
Windows command line,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.355
use the command there.

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:09.770
Whereas in Linux, you use

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.205
the ls command to
list all the files.

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:15.830
If you're using a Mac or Linux,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.855
they both come with Unix shell.

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:20.135
You don't have to
install Git Bash.

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:23.555
Git Bash is only meant for
Windows operating system.

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:26.300
If you're not used to
either of these tools,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.190
then obviously it
is always better to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.800
choose Git Bash over good cmd.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.150
And the reason being,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.740
if you're used to Git Bash,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.290
you can also work on
Linux operating system

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.930
at later point in
time, if you were to.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.390
The third option we have is get

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.805
GUI or graphical user interface.

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:45.320
And as the name suggests,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.520
this tool will provide

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.045
a graphical user interface
to interact with Git.

00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:53.630
Now, I do have to mention
that get gooey does not

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.065
have support for all the
features that get has to offer.

00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:59.360
We can do more with
Git Bash or get

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.330
CMD combat to get glory.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.855
That being said, good GUI
has its own role as well.

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:07.220
For example, if
you'd like to take

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.320
a look at the overall picture,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.885
or if you'd like to get
a bird's eye view of

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:14.540
the entire historical
changes, et cetera.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.700
Then you might find
it useful to use

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.160
the get query compared
to get that cash.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.320
However, in the
rest of the course,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.400
we'll be using Git Bash as
this is the best option.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.200
We might as well explore

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.095
get-go way at some
point in the course.

00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:33.815
But we're going to be primarily
focusing on Git Bash,

00:02:33.815 --> 00:02:37.140
which is also the
popular choice.
