00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Let's talk about this branch
protection rule would say

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.500
is required review
from code owners.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.170
Basically github
allows us to create

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.575
a special file with
the name code owners,

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:15.780
Wherein we can specify who owns

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.255
what based on file patterns.

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:20.430
It is somewhat similar to
the patterns that we're

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.765
specifying a dot gitignore file.

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:25.430
But we also specify who owns

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.040
the files that correspond
to those patterns.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.140
And by enabling this option,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.770
called on us would automatically
be requested for review.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.350
Whenever somebody
raises a pull request

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.945
that modifies the
code that they own.

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:40.834
I know this sounds confusing.

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:42.350
And that's why I'm
going to quickly

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.970
demonstrate the same phosphor.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.460
Let us go to our repository.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.280
And I'm in the main branch here,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.505
I'm going to create a new file.

00:00:57.505 --> 00:01:03.275
I'm going to name the
file as code or nurse.

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:07.040
It has to be exact same
name, all capital letters.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.500
And inside this file I'm
going to specify one

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.350
of the owners with a pattern.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.810
For example, I could
say star dot js and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.595
all the files with

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:23.315
dot js extension would
be owned by let say,

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.430
look, we already have look

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.190
at it as one of the collaborate
to solve this project.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.175
So wherever you're
going to add as owners,

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:34.010
they need to have write
permissions to this project.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.280
So let me quickly copied

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.810
the Luke's email address
and pasted here.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.770
You can also add the
username of Luke.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.560
Either way, luke
is now going to be

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.960
the owner of all these files.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.070
Let me come at this file.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:05.000
Now let me try erasing pull
requests with ab.js file 1.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.480
Second, let me just quickly
create some random branch.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.020
And let me quickly
add a new file.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.700
Scripts dot js.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.910
Convert the file. Let's now

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.270
go ahead and raise
the pull request.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.340
And the moment I do that,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.280
you'll see waiting
on code owner review

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.230
from Luke's under Corp. Now
if you go to Luke's account,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.550
if I click on the pull request,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.245
this is Luke's account.

00:02:57.245 --> 00:02:59.735
Look is going to
say this message

00:02:59.735 --> 00:03:03.485
saying that he needs to
review a pull request.

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:06.710
So since the fact that
Luke is the owner

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.470
of all dot js files and

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.990
somebody raised pull request on

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.580
the same branch where Luke was

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.965
added as the owner
of these files,

00:03:15.965 --> 00:03:18.500
get has automatically asked Mr.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.400
Luke to review the changes
or the pull request.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.410
So look, can now do
something with this review.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.590
Let's say that he has
approved of the changes.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.580
And now we can go ahead
and merge all the changes.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.169
This option is already enabled.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.315
I had already enabled it
and saved the changes.

00:03:56.315 --> 00:03:59.585
And hence, this
has taken effect.

00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:01.235
If we disable this,

00:04:01.235 --> 00:04:02.705
then Luke wouldn't have been

00:04:02.705 --> 00:04:05.910
receiving the review request.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.910
Let's go back to the repository.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.190
Generally we keep
code owners file

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.340
in the base branch or
the default branch.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.805
Since this file is currently
placed in the main branch,

00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:28.220
manager or somebody
raises pull request

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.625
asking to merge the
changes to this branch.

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:35.375
That's when this code on a
spiral would take effect.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:38.390
So you'd want to keep
this file in a branch

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.795
where developers would
contribute their code to.

00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:42.560
End.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.280
By the way, there are
other bunch of patterns we

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.200
can use for that you can

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.495
defer to the official
documentation,

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:53.570
are at also provided
notes giving you some

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.419
of the example patterns
along with some description.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.610
I'm going to keep this
as a notes you can

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.895
download and take your time
trying to understand this.

00:05:07.895 --> 00:05:10.010
It's actually pretty
straightforward.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.215
The patterns are
pretty much similar to

00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:15.260
the patterns that we include
in dot gitignore file.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.695
Except we're going to
also specify the owners

00:05:18.695 --> 00:05:22.685
has two horns of files
corresponding to those patterns.

00:05:22.685 --> 00:05:25.460
You can also specify teams.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.444
So team would be owning
particular set of files.

00:05:31.444 --> 00:05:33.695
Like in this case.

00:05:33.695 --> 00:05:35.990
If you take one out
debate memberships of

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.450
GitHub for your organization,

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.360
then you can also add deems.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.380
Hope it makes sense.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.220
I'll see you next.
