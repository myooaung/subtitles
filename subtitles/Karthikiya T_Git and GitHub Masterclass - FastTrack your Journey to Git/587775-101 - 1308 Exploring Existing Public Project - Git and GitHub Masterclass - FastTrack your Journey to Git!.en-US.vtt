00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.850
In this video, we're
going to explore one

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.740
of the existing
projects available on

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.020
GitHub and see if
we can make sense

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.855
out of it based on what you've
learned in this chapter.

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:13.275
If you have any project in
mind that you already know,

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:16.335
then you can search
it up over here.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:19.635
Are you can go to explore,

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:24.280
to explore some of
the public projects.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.320
You can also take a look at

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.785
projects based on a
particular topic.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:33.390
Here you're going
to see a list of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.720
topics arranged in
alphabetical order.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.525
Here are list of popular topics.

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:42.310
Let's click on maybe react.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.560
Let's randomly open up
on all the projects

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.500
here. An x dot js.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.460
I'm just simply going to
pick something random.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.840
Maybe this one iconic framework.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.080
The first thing you're going
to notice once you visit

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.975
the project page is
the read me file.

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:15.490
Readme file would typically

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.949
constitute information
about the software,

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:20.290
how you can install
it in case if you

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.780
want to get started as
contributor for this project,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.780
what are all the steps
involved in that?

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.320
To get started as contributor,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.560
you will find projects
which are plants

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.265
and bunch of such information
in the ReadMe file.

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:37.130
So this is probably
the starting point.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.620
If you want to get started
with a particular project.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.255
Once you go through
the ReadMe file,

00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:48.050
you can actually get started
with the contribution.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.785
But let's explore the Pull
Request section here.

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:53.390
As you can see currently it has

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.270
about 33 actor poor
requests which are yet

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.645
to be merged, are reviewed.

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:01.490
You basically are
going to see a couple

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.515
of types of requests.

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.840
The first one is the one that

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.060
we've talked in our
previous lectures.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.150
The second one is something
that we haven't yet talked.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.940
It is called Draft
pull requests.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.830
You can say that a
particular pull request

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.794
is a draft for request.

00:02:17.794 --> 00:02:19.970
By looking at this icon,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.590
if it is grayed out,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.199
then it is a draft
pull requests.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.555
You might be wondering what
is a draft for requests.

00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:29.435
We're going to talk about
it in upcoming lectures.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:31.550
But basically, if you have
any changes which are

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.680
just proposed changes to have

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.409
the discussion on or
to take feedback,

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.975
but are not really
intended to be merged.

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:41.449
Then you can raise a
draft for requests.

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.490
Just initiate that discussion.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.100
Everybody else can
actually take a look at

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.860
your code changes and
put some comments on it.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.570
And based on that, you
will decide whether

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.130
you want to proceed
with that or not.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.995
You also notice these
so-called labels

00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:00.815
to the right of each
pull requests title.

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:02.390
Again, this is
something we'll touch

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.325
on in upcoming lectures.

00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:06.200
But labels would
essentially allow you

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.375
to classify the poll requests.

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:09.860
In other words,
it would help you

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.720
categorize the poor requests.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.455
For example, if I
click on this label,

00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:18.470
you're going to see all
the pull requests that are

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.575
corresponding to that
particular label.

00:03:21.575 --> 00:03:23.660
As the owner of the repository,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.000
if I would like to
take a look at list of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.120
pull requests that corresponds
to a particular label.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.110
I can do that. You might

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.670
be seeing bunch of other things

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.115
here which we haven't
yet talked about.

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:39.784
We might explore them
in upcoming lectures.

00:03:39.784 --> 00:03:41.120
But I guess you have raised to

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.895
a stage where you can
learn things on your own.

00:03:43.895 --> 00:03:45.110
In fact, that's the goal of

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.510
this course to make
you stand on your own.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.120
I really cannot teach
everything that is out there.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.410
My job is to make you feel

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.150
comfortable with the technology.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.480
And I think so far we
have reached that stage.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.690
It is now up to you
will have to explore,

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.385
go beyond, and do something

00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:03.440
to expand those skills further.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.750
One of the best
ways to do that is

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.035
basically to actually contribute
one of these projects.

00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:10.310
For example, if you're learning

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.635
React or Python or whatever,

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:15.470
just take a look at bunch
of projects that are here

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.235
related to that particular
topic and start contributing.

00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:21.170
Every project must be having

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.605
some instructions on how you
get started as contributor.

00:04:24.605 --> 00:04:26.930
You can go through that and

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.495
get started with contribution.

00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:32.045
So these are all
the pull requests

00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:34.655
raised by people
like you and me.

00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:37.070
And you can see that
this project has been

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.715
forked for over 13
thousand times.

00:04:40.715 --> 00:04:43.260
By the time of this recording.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.129
Let's take a look
at list of issues.

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.610
So there are about
554 issues currently.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.085
If you want to report a bug
or suggest a new feature,

00:04:55.085 --> 00:04:58.985
you can do that as well
by clicking on new issue.

00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:01.385
You can add the report, a bug,

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:04.490
or request for a feature.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.600
You can go through the
documentation, et cetera.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.155
This layout is actually
customized for this project.

00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:14.270
You might see a slightly
different layout

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.865
depending on the project
that you're viewing.

00:05:16.865 --> 00:05:18.740
For example, let's
say that I've used

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.645
their software and
I found a bug,

00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:22.985
and then I wanted
to report that bug.

00:05:22.985 --> 00:05:26.610
So I can certainly
click on this.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.335
And they have designed a
format to report the bug.

00:05:33.335 --> 00:05:35.210
First of all, they wanted
to make sure that I

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.765
read the contributing
guidelines.

00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:43.070
Once I do that, I can
click on this checkbox,

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.535
their code of conduct, etc.

00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:49.550
The Washington, which
bug is deciding?

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.380
What is the current behavior,

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.015
what is the expected behavior?

00:05:53.015 --> 00:05:55.400
Clear steps to reproduce,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.410
and bunch of other
information to

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.970
ultimately help
somebody who wanted to

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.470
fix this bug get

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.740
all the information they
need to fix the bug.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.779
Let's go back to issues.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.870
So you can take a
look at these issues.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.075
If you think you can
fix one of these,

00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:15.935
you already know what to do.

00:06:15.935 --> 00:06:18.110
You just have to
fork the project,

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.135
clone the project,
your local machine,

00:06:20.135 --> 00:06:24.020
fix the bug, push those changes
to the forked repository,

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.240
and then raise the
pull requests.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.605
Like I said before,

00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:34.970
take this as a task and
actually contribute to an odd,

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.850
they're valuable
projects on GitHub.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.545
Once you get your pull requests

00:06:39.545 --> 00:06:42.200
merged or approved
by the code owners,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.645
it's going to give you
a lot of satisfaction

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:47.735
and it will give you some
sense of accomplishment.

00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:50.000
Once you see that happening.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.505
It might take some time

00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:55.160
for the entire
process to complete.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.505
But I highly recommend
you to do that.

00:06:58.505 --> 00:07:01.595
And that way you're putting
everything together.

00:07:01.595 --> 00:07:04.070
What you've learned in
this course so far.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.620
In the rest of the course,
we're going to talk about

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.515
all the missing pieces
in these technologies.

00:07:09.515 --> 00:07:11.285
But like I said before,

00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:14.330
I think we've reached a stage
where you are on your own

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.610
and you've learned all
the essential topics

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.200
of Git and GitHub.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.220
I wish you good luck,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.795
but we're not done
with the course yet.

00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:23.930
We've got a lot of other
topics to discuss as well.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.240
So yeah, take it
up as a task and

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.565
contribute to an off
day valuable projects.

00:07:28.565 --> 00:07:30.720
I'll see you next.
