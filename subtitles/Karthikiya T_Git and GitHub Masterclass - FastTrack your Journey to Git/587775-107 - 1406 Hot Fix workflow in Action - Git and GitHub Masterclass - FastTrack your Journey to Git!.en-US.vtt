00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.325
Okay, let us continue.

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:04.770
Now make an assumption
that on off your customer

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.080
has reported a bug and you

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.430
realize that it is actually

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.729
a critical bug which needs
to be fixed on priority.

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:14.640
And so you're not planning
to have a hot fix.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.125
So what is the first
thing we need to do?

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:22.145
Well, we already
have a branch handy.

00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:28.100
The one we had previously
created with the version name.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.635
This is where it comes in handy.

00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:32.270
We can create another
branch out of

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.775
this branch to fix the bug.

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:36.035
And then we're going to merge

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:38.735
all those changes in
development branch

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:40.535
as well as the release and

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:43.235
eventually on the
master branch as well.

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:47.255
So the customers would get
an update with the fix.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:51.769
So I have chosen this
particular version branch.

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.040
Let us now create
another branch to fix

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.090
the bug and gets the version
we need to give here.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.310
Since you're walking on
hot fix went increment

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.850
the value of patch
version by one.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.830
This time the name of the
branch is going to be 101.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.689
I'm going to create this branch.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.410
Once again to simulate the
behavior of fixing a bug.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.240
Let me just simply
create a file bug,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.395
fixed dot dxdy, whatever.

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:35.719
And I'm going to
commit this change.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:46.475
We now need to merge these
changes to development branch.

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:49.025
We can either do it from here.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:50.930
We can go to pull

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.869
the cross-section and
raise a new pull request.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.180
Choose the branch that
we've just created and

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.465
we're going to compare it
with the develop branch.

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:05.585
So we have this fixed in here.

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:08.690
Create a product class,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.640
and let us out.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.870
So go ahead and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:22.235
merge the bug fix onto
the development branch.

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:26.330
And sure enough, if you go

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.500
back in the development branch,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.780
you see the bug fix.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.290
We're going to follow similar
steps for release as well.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.825
We went to raise a pull request.

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:44.915
We're going to
choose release here.

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:52.350
And the bug fix branch
cleared the pull requests.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:02.490
And that does go ahead
and merge these changes.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.815
Now, after a lot of testing,

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:12.720
as human things
are working great.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.840
We're going to go ahead
and merge the changes from

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.530
Release branch to
the master branch.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.890
As you can see, we now have

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.755
the bug fix in the
release branch.

00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:31.040
Let's create a pull
request real quick.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.405
We're going to compare the
release branch. I'm sorry.

00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:38.285
We're going to compare
the master branch

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:41.310
and the release branch

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.139
and merge all those changes
in the master branch.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.050
To go back and switch
to master branch should

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.955
be able to see the bug fix

00:04:07.955 --> 00:04:11.284
and that's how you
deliver a patch.

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:15.215
Next, we're going to talk
about how we can create tags.

00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:17.630
And in fact, we had
missed creating

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.810
the tag in the previous
version of our software.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.700
But we can also create tags for

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.965
the commits that
were already done.

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:26.030
How we do that,

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.410
there is something we're
going to talk about

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.720
next. I'll see you next.
