00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.760
Now, what are the
changes that Luke

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.770
wants to contribute
to this project?

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.660
Is going to bring in
all those changes

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.790
locally, test them,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.500
and then push all
those changes to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.560
his own forked
repository in order to

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.070
simulate that behavior that
has made bunch of commits.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.590
And of course, as
a good practice,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.465
we're going to
create a new branch.

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:24.195
And that's where we're
going to make our commits.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:25.470
That's what I've been preaching

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.940
all throughout this course.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.320
We would never want to make

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.225
commerce statically
on the main branch,

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:32.265
but rather we'll
create a new branch

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.885
and make hollow contribution.

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:38.060
So let's open this with
Visual Studio code real

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.159
quick and create a new branch.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.990
Let's call it feature ten.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.030
Maybe. Create a new branch.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.460
And I'm just simply going
to add a couple of files.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.565
One dot TXT, for instance,

00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:10.500
go to Source Control,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.730
created one dot TXT.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.620
Commit the changes.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.875
And let me make one
more committed.

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:30.030
Maybe two dot dx, dy, whatever.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.690
Just wanted to make sure that
we see couple of comments.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.890
And this feature branch

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.290
has the word introducing
our changes.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.524
We have feature one branch

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:51.990
and we have made a couple
of comments in it.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.450
You can see it in this
graph here, as you can see,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.920
the feature one branches,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.530
couple of comments ahead.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.625
The main branch.

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:05.165
Now what if, while I'm still
working on this feature,

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:06.830
we have bunch of new updates on

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.845
the upstream repository or
the original repository.

00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:11.990
How are we going to get
all those updates in

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.545
our local machine as well
as forked repository.

00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:18.390
That's what we're going
to talk about next.
