00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
So let's go to
some there second,

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:04.800
to review the changes
done by Mr. Luke.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.660
This can also be account of

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.615
some other collaborator
in this repository.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.715
They can review it as well.

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:13.440
And what they have to do

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.060
to review all the
changes done by

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.030
Luke is that they're

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.730
going to go into Pull
Request section.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.940
Click on it. And then

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.405
there'll be able to see this
option, add your review.

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:34.190
And here they can actually
review all the changes.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.500
If they're not happy
with any of these,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.690
then they can actually
leave a comment saying,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.370
please update another line,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.350
something of that sort.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.755
And rather than choosing
the option that pro,

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.065
I'm going to set
request changes,

00:00:57.065 --> 00:00:58.670
which means I'm not really happy

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.695
with the code introduced.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:02.540
I want to look to bring

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.820
these updates based
on my comment.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.385
Then I want to review again.

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:10.800
So let's click on Submit Review.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.180
On the Luke's account.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.040
He's going to say this
changes or requested.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.310
He'll be able to see the review.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.720
Like so.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.180
Here's the comment
made by cylinder.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.145
Please update another line.

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:32.720
So what Luke is going to

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.750
do is actually going

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.450
to bring in all the changes

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.955
based on the reviewer's comment.

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:46.590
Something of this sort.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.600
Let's commit this change.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.379
We can push all those changes.

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:02.360
Or alternatively, we can

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.150
click this button that
says sync changes.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.144
So this is going to
push our changes.

00:02:10.144 --> 00:02:12.080
And if there are
any changes to be

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.820
pulled upward, be done as well.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.440
Let's go back to GitHub.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.605
And these changes should have

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:29.130
been present and
future one branch.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.280
And as you can see, we're
able to see that new commit.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.935
Now we don't have to raise
another poll request.

00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:42.170
The existing pool request

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.780
would be populated
automatically.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.490
Let's go back to senders
account real quick.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.370
And Nelson lord is able to see

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.525
an update saying that a
new commit has been made.

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:01.880
Typically look nice to send

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.770
an email reminder or something.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.600
Or there might be some
kind of a tool which would

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.210
automatically send
an email reminder

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.875
to all the reviewers.

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:14.195
So sender would view
all the changes

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:17.450
and he would review
all the changes

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.560
and assume that he's very
happy with the changes,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.390
is going to protect
them and saying

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.100
something of that
sort and is going to

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.140
approve the changes like cell.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.600
Let's go back to Luke's account.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.760
Now look in bar from the March.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.100
We're going to talk
about it Up next.
