00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.524
Hold that, let us talk
about interactive rebase.

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:06.060
And for this purpose I
have 1 second brought back

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.520
the project to what
it was earlier.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.030
Before performing the
rebase operation.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.890
Let me switch to feature

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.330
one branch and
perform the rebase.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.690
I want to right-click on the
latest commit off Master,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.750
click on rebase current
branch on this comment.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.840
But this time I'm going to
choose this option which says

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.935
blonde interactive
rebase in new terminal.

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:33.990
This is equivalent to running

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.750
the command git
rebase with dash,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.730
dash interact to option.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.220
Let's click yes rebase.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.875
And this time we'll open
up the text editor.

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:51.770
Here you're going to
see holders list of

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.145
commits that are part of
the feature one branch.

00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:59.090
What interactive rebase would
allow us to do is we can

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.260
actually perform a lot of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.020
customization based
on our needs.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.470
If you see we have
bunch of commands here,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.010
which we can use to tell git

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.510
what we want to do
with the commits

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.235
or feature one branch.

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:17.120
By default, this
command is used pick,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.910
which means we want to
use that committee.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.990
What that essentially means
is we want these comets of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.550
feature one branch to be

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.385
candidates for the
rebase operation.

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:30.410
But you can change
this command to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.825
something else based
on your requirement.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:36.755
For example, maybe I'd like
to use this command reward,

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:38.390
which means use commit,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.745
but added the commit message.

00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:42.980
Essentially, if
you'd like to change

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.975
the message to something else,

00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:47.359
then you can use this command.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.580
Let's, I want to
change the message of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.640
this particular committee.
And let's do that.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.390
I would like to use
this drop command.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.080
To drop this particular commit.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.989
I know that this comment is
going to create conflicts

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:06.650
because we edited product
dot txt file in this commit.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.260
So I'm going to drop this.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.940
Likewise, you got a bunch of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.340
other commands
which you can use.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.905
You can just go through
the description

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:19.790
and see if they fit
for your needs.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.760
Save the file and close it.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.550
So we're going to see
another prompt asking us to

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.955
chain the message
of that commit.

00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:35.270
If you remember what
this particular commit,

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.180
we had used the command reward.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.725
That's where I get
this prompting

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:43.560
us to chain the message
to something else.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.820
You can change this
to whatever you want.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.930
Of course, don't say blah,

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.075
blah, type something meaningful.

00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:53.850
I want to save the
file and close this.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.940
So this time if you notice
we only have five commits.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.310
Because we dropped
one of the commits in

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.020
feature branch where we

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.765
made changes in
product dot TXT file.

00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:07.670
And also for the other
commenting feature,

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.255
one branch would change
the message to blah, blah.

00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:13.460
So go ahead and try
and experiment with

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.460
interactive rebase.
I'll see you next.
