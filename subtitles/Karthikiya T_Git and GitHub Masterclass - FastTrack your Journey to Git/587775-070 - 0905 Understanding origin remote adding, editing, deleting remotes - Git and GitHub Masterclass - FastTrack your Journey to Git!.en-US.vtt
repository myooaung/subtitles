00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.590
Let's talk about origin.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.660
Origin is kind of
like an alias on

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.930
your system for a particular
remote repository.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.895
Let me explain what I mean.

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:12.730
There are certain commands
and get where you'd be

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.240
required to specify the
remote repository URI.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.430
Like in case of git push.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.960
We're going to talk more about

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.645
git push command in
upcoming lectures.

00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:26.050
But essentially what this
command allows us to do is it

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.430
will allow us to push

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.550
our local commits on to
the remote repository.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.920
Well, such commands
requires us to

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.660
enter where we want to push

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.565
our commits to by specifying
the remote repository URI.

00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:41.560
Now how about we
give some name to

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.415
this ERA so that

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:45.725
every time we have to
run such a command,

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:48.410
instead of specifying
the entire ERA,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.545
would just need to type
in that name instead.

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:53.825
That's going to give us
a lot of convenience.

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:56.270
And that's essentially
what is origin.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.640
Origin is kind of like
a shortened name for

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.560
the remote repo study that

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.065
the project was
originally cloned from.

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:05.524
So that instead of
entering the URI,

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:09.815
we could just say
origin, like so.

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:11.150
And it is Asda. We have

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.970
entered the remote
repository URI.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.640
We can rename this name
to something else.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.055
We can also add
additional remotes.

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:21.815
When I say remote is just simply

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.965
a name representing a
particular remote repository,

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:28.040
how we can even
delete these remotes.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.140
Let me demonstrate
you what I mean.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.670
If you go inside
the dot git folder,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.090
inside your project and
open up the config file.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.260
You notice that we have one
remote with the name origin,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.885
and it points to a remote
repository in the URL field.

00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:53.690
This is exactly
what is the mode.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.329
So every time we have
to run the command,

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.270
where would be required
to enter the CR?

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.304
We can just enter the
name origin instead.

00:02:03.304 --> 00:02:05.075
We can also rename this,

00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:08.240
but of course, we shouldn't
do it on this file directly.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.280
Instead going to
run the command.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.980
Let's do that.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.380
Inside the Git Bash.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.960
Let us first create
a new remote.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.480
And yes, we can have multiple
remotes and there are

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.470
scenarios where we might
require multiple remotes.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.725
We're going to talk about
it in upcoming lectures.

00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:30.830
But for now let us see how
we can create a remote,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.320
rename it, and even
delete a remote.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.295
The command for
that is git remote.

00:02:37.295 --> 00:02:40.385
Add name of the remote,

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:41.795
the name that you'd like to,

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.370
to that remote repository.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.760
Let's call it temp,
report, whatever.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.990
And then you're going to specify

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.600
the URI of the
remote repository.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.805
This is just a dummy URL
which doesn't exist.

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:07.740
And if I hit Enter,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.750
and if we go back
to config file,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.790
you'll see that there's

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.820
a new remote created with
the name temporary pole,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.560
whose URL is the URL

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.990
that we've just specified
in the command.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.765
Let me try to
rename this remote.

00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:30.545
Git remote, rename them ripple.

00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:33.200
The name of the remote
would like to rename.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.610
And then you're going to specify

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.650
the name that we would
like to give it.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.705
New temp, repo, let's say.

00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:47.330
And this is going to change
the name to that new name.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.995
Finally, let us see how
we can remove a remote.

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:57.845
Git. Remote remove
is the option.

00:03:57.845 --> 00:03:59.870
Then you're going to specify

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.110
the remote that you
would like to remove.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.390
And that's it. This
has removed remote.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.304
When we had run
the clone command

00:04:15.304 --> 00:04:17.810
to clone a particular
remote repository,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.705
git has essentially
created a remote for us.

00:04:20.705 --> 00:04:23.135
The name of that
remote is origin,

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:27.440
whose URL is the URL we have
used to clone the project.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.110
You'll understand more
about remotes as we

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.210
progress in this course.
I'll see you next.
