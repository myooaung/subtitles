00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.430
Okay, Let's talk about

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.400
this branch prediction rule
that says dismiss tail,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.045
pull request approvals,
new commits are pushed.

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:11.640
What this means is
whenever somebody raises

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.365
a pull request and

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:15.570
also assume that even
the review is done,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.130
but that pull request,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.990
now before merging
those changes on to

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.640
some other branch led to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.350
a dollar per kilometer
team or changes in

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.435
the branch that
we want to merge.

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:25.890
Now, should we allow the changes

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.360
to be reviewed once again,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.830
are not his ward.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.390
This option is saying,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.760
if we enable this option,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.770
that means that we
want to mandate

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.495
the review process, once again,

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:38.490
reviewing all the latest changes

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.860
before it can be merged
onto another branch.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.630
Disable this option, then

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.275
note abuse needed to
merge the changes.

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:50.090
If you've understood
what I've just

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.770
said, that's well and good.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.330
You can skip the next video.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.220
Otherwise, just hold on.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.140
I'm going to
demonstrate the same.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.245
So right now this is disabled.

00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:03.020
Let me go back to

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.160
the depository and quickly
raise a pull request for that.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.210
Let me create another branch
with some random name is df.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.535
And let's also have one commit.

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:19.595
Maybe by adding a new file.

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:21.425
Let's give it some name,

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:22.670
something of that sort,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.170
and commit the changes.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.510
Let's raise pull request.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.700
We're going to compare
main branch with

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.710
the branch that
we've just created.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.310
Create pull request.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.450
Create pull request.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.120
So this has created
the pull requests.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.270
We need at least
one approved review

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.105
before we merge these changes.

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:57.550
Now the same person
who has actually raise

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.880
a pull request cannot
review his own code.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.310
For that. I've already added Mr.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.980
Luke as one of the
collaborators of this project.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.020
Let me know, go
to Luke's account

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.719
and quickly accept the changes.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.425
So here is the pull request
from the Luke's account.

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:20.930
And I'm going to add my review

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.740
I'm going to review these
changes, approving everything.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.340
Now if you go back to
sum those seconds,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.470
you're going to see
that the changes were

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.660
approved and that I can

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.374
go ahead and merge
the pull request.

00:02:43.374 --> 00:02:46.225
But meanwhile, before
merging the changes,

00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:48.565
let me try to make
another commit

00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:52.340
in the new branch that
we've just created.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.340
I'm going to go back to the
code base and to that branch.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.630
And let me add another file
with some other random name,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.030
like so and commit the changes.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.154
If we go back to
the pull requests,

00:03:14.154 --> 00:03:18.340
you're now going to see
those new changes as well.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.280
Right now you can see
that no additional

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.000
reviews needed to merge
the pull requests.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.635
That's because this option
right here is disabled.

00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:32.080
Let me enable this option.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.825
Save Changes.

00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:38.510
Let me quickly
enter the password.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.460
And now if I were to

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.430
make another change and
commit to this branch,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.150
let me do that real quick.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.380
Something of that sort.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.030
Commit the changes.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.439
If I go back to
the pull requests,

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.270
this time, you'll see that

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.130
we need at least one review once

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.580
again before we can
merge those changes.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.955
Well, since Sunday is the
owner of this repository,

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:17.940
is able to see this option

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.180
to actually merge
without waiting for

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.370
the comments to be met or
without the viewing to be done.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.110
But ideally the lapels will

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.015
not be able to see this option.

00:04:29.015 --> 00:04:30.680
But I hope you got the point

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.700
of this branch protection rule.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.870
I'll see you next.
