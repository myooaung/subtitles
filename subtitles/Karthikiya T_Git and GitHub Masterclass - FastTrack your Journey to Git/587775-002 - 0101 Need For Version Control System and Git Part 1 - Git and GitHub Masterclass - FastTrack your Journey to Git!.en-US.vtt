00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.655
Why do we need version
control system?

00:00:02.655 --> 00:00:06.105
Meet Mr. Bob, who is
an investment advisor.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:08.535
And due to all the
amazing work he's doing,

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:11.565
his client base has increased
significantly over time.

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:14.820
And so he sees a need to have
his own personal website.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.375
So Bob had envisioned
a website of its own.

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:20.865
And Bob being a
non-technical guy,

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:22.290
he thought of taking help from

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.645
a freelancer to
get the job done.

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:26.340
So he met sender who is

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.860
a freelance or unexplained
him everything

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.180
what is expecting in

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.780
his website and give the
deadline as 24th of February,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.150
which happens to be his birthday

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.595
to it's under a grade and
started working on the project.

00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:42.095
Insights on those computer.

00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:45.020
There had created this folder
called investment app,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.730
inside which he created

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.550
all these files which
will make that website.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.380
After a few days off work,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.150
cylinder had finally finished

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.265
working on creating the website.

00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:56.555
He tested it.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.160
He also hosted it on

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.489
a hosting provider or on
a Cloud service provider.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.705
God, the application up and
running and shown it to Bob.

00:01:05.705 --> 00:01:09.485
Bob was quite impressed with
the work done by sunder.

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:11.840
And so now he decided to add

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.600
couple of more features
into his website.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.345
And you get the deadline
as 20th of February.

00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:18.950
Two goods sooner once again,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.810
had accepted the deal and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.525
started walking on those
additional features.

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:27.260
And once again, cinder had
added all those features,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.270
hosted it on hosting provider,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.165
got the website up and
running and shown it to Bob.

00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:34.145
But this time, however,

00:01:34.145 --> 00:01:37.115
bob was not completely
satisfied with the work.

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:39.410
Even though the latest
features introduced after

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.365
24th of February,
we're working fine.

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:45.050
The features that were
working earlier seem to have

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.005
broken or are not
working as expected.

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:49.310
So Bob had explained

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.740
the same two cinder
and asked him to undo

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.750
all the new changes
and bring back

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.830
the application to what it
was on 24th of February.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.470
To it soon they're
hesitantly accepted.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.020
But unfortunately for Cinder,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.655
It's not going to
be an easy task

00:02:04.655 --> 00:02:06.305
to undo all those changes

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:08.000
because there's a
lot of new code

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.505
introduced after
24th of February,

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:14.075
and the code has scattered
across multiple files.

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:15.830
It's really hard for sender to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.720
recollect each and every line of

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.455
code that was introduced
and undo all those changes.

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:23.525
However, since the one
to accept the deal,

00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:25.265
to keep the client happy,

00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:27.110
after a lot of sleepless nights

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.955
and after a lot of frustration

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:33.335
and a lot of testing center
finally got the job done.

00:02:33.335 --> 00:02:37.325
However, this time, in the
midst of Bob's deadline,

00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:39.260
and Bob was wondering
why it took so

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.680
under couple of weeks
just to undo the changes.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.030
Well, it only took him

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.520
a few days to create
the entire website.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.830
This has resulted in Bob
being not satisfied and soon,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.940
soon started to see
similar kinds of

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.610
issues with some of his
other clients as well.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.620
They were complaining
that some of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.965
the features were not
working as expected,

00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:02.780
which had worked earlier.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.460
And so they wanted to get them

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.140
fixed or they want to go back

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.280
to previous versions of

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.680
their web applications
which are working fine.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.140
So sunder gave it a thought

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.230
and finally came up
with a genius idea,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.140
which are somewhat
solve this problem.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.720
We'll talk about it
in just a while.
