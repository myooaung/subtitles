00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.825
Welcome to this course
on Git and GitHub.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:05.700
Here are some of
the reasons why you

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.890
should learn Git and GitHub.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.050
More than $83 million per cent

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.015
across the globe use Get up.

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:15.765
90% of Fortune funded
companies use GitHub.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.270
More than 200 plus
million repositories are

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.375
projects are currently
residing on GitHub.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.330
Github is a key component
of your DevOps journey.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.075
In fact, if you want to
pursue DevOps Catia,

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:29.205
GitHub is a starting point.

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:32.175
You're not getting anywhere
unless you learn GitHub.

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:34.650
Github is also the most
popular code hosting

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.735
platform compared
to its competitors,

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.545
like Bitbucket or GitLab,

00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:41.165
get is the most popular
version control system

00:00:41.165 --> 00:00:42.680
to ever exist.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.949
It's almost a must-have skill
for any IT professional.

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.230
And I guess you
already know that.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.945
Here are the goals
of this course.

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:52.370
I'll teach you
everything you need to

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.870
know about Git and GitHub.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.080
I've been using it since
2014 and I've even had

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.520
experienced in managing teams

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.274
and meeting the
project deadlines.

00:01:00.274 --> 00:01:02.584
I have fine-tune the
syllabus accordingly.

00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:04.010
And you don't have to refer to

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.215
any other books
or other courses.

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:07.940
You will learn
everything you need in

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.115
this course alone and
you don't need to go.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:12.110
Anything beyond this.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.600
Make you feel
confident to handle

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.615
any project tasks related
to Git and GitHub.

00:01:17.615 --> 00:01:19.280
Teach you how to contribute to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.500
open-source projects and make

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.140
you confident with interviews.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.500
But why should you
learn from this course?

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.810
Aldi, important and
essential topics

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.745
are covered in the
first few chapters.

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:33.290
And all the topics that are not

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.275
essential or discuss
later in the course.

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:38.990
Just we're watching for
six to ten chapters.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.270
You'll start to
feel confident to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.910
start taking up the
task later to get up.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.440
That being said, I highly

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.360
recommend you to watch
the entire course.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.770
To learn the entire subject.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.700
I combine multiple
related topics in

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.370
the same lecture to save
your precious time.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.260
If it makes sense
for me to combine

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.030
multiple related topics and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.475
teach them together,
I always do that.

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:03.245
Not only to save your time,

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:05.960
but also to teach
more effectively.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.810
I'll teach you this object
with real-world scenarios,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.640
use cases and workflows.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.990
I've handled some of the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.045
toughest project
challenges myself.

00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:17.240
And I can certainly use that
experience to talk about

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.770
some of the real-world
scenarios where you

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.365
can apply all these concepts.

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:23.840
I have unique ability to teach

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.470
very complex concepts into
easy to understand manner.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.555
You'll understand
this by yourself

00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:32.420
once you make progress
in this course.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.085
I also have expectations on
who is watching this course.

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:40.715
Forget about what you already
know and start fresh.

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:42.830
If you already know
something about Git and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.380
GitHub or any related subject,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.390
I want you to just wipe
out everything from

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.315
your mind and start
with a clean mind.

00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:53.345
Otherwise, you might hear some
conflicting terminologies,

00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:56.270
which might then
start to confuse you.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.400
Dedication and
commitment to learn

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.320
the inter-subject were living

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.075
in the world of distractions.

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:04.040
Unless you put efforts to stay

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.130
committed and dedicated to
learn the entire subject,

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.620
you're not really
learning anything.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.065
Practice what I teach.

00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:14.450
Practicing for once
is equivalent to ten

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.255
times of reading set
by somebody somewhere.

00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:19.370
But it makes perfect sense.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.085
You should try to
practice what I teach.

00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:23.750
Otherwise, you
might lose track of

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.765
the subject and get confused.

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:29.180
Stay focused on one course,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.445
whether you take this course
or some other course,

00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:33.650
complete it fully, and then

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.125
switch to other source of
information if you wish.

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:37.955
But don't mix things together,

00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:40.835
which will again create
a lot of confusion.

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:44.675
Dedicate just one hour every
day without distractions.

00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:47.885
It's better to learn for one
hour with complete focus

00:03:47.885 --> 00:03:52.010
than learning for eight hours
with not-so-good focus.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.370
Keep that in mind. Next we'll

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.575
start to understand
what is get Github,

00:03:57.575 --> 00:03:59.090
what is version control system,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.760
et cetera, with
real-world examples?

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.265
And that's a great way
to start our course.

00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:06.360
I'll see you next.
