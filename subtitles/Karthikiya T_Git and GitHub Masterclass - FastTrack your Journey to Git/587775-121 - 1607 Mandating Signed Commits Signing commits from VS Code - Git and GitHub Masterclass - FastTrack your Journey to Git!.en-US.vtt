00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.430
Okay, Let's not talk about

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.985
this branch prediction rule
that we had left out earlier.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.044
It says required signed commits.

00:00:09.044 --> 00:00:11.535
You should be able to
understand this by now.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:12.900
If you enable this option,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.240
what that means is we
only want to allow

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.789
sign comets in the
matching branches.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.670
As simple as that says,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.470
This video is going
to be very shot.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.570
Let me also include
one more thing.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.610
Let us take a look at
how we can have signed

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.240
commits from Visual Studio Code.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.325
For that, let me
open up this project

00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:33.840
using Visual Studio Code.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.830
So the setting for
that is you need to go

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.365
to File menu, Preferences,

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:45.780
settings and search for.
Let me do it again.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.005
Settings and search for GPG.

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.030
You need to enable
this option that

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.270
says enable commit signing.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.775
Close settings.

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:00.980
Let's quickly make
an edit in one of

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.860
the files just so that
we can commit something.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.550
I've been put in some
random text, save the file.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.000
And let me commit the changes.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.975
Sign from VS code,

00:01:20.975 --> 00:01:24.090
something of that sort.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.320
And let me make the commit.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.785
You might be prompted to
enter the passphrase.

00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:32.390
Please enter it and click.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.379
Okay.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:35.525
Since I've already
done this before,

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:38.060
I didn't get that
prompt once again.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.210
But if you go to GitHub now
and you reload the page,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.140
of course, we need to
push those changes

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.430
to be able to see
them on GitHub.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.580
So let's quickly do that.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.955
Let's reload the page.

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:07.250
And as you can see,
we're able to see

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.430
that commit and it
is verified as well.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.980
Hope it makes sense.
I'll see you next.
