00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.490
If you're introducing the dot

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.710
gitignore file in your project,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.660
you don't really have
to brainstorm as to

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.910
what patterns you want
to keep in that file.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.470
You can just simply use one of

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.210
the existing tools with

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.075
a quick Google search
git ignore generator.

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:17.190
I came across with this link.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.590
It stopped al.com.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.765
You could be seeing
some other website,

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:24.180
but they do the same
job of generating

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.530
patterns for you depending on

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.480
the kind of project
you're building.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.950
For example, let's say that I'm

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.335
building an Android application.

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:37.270
So I'm just simply type in
Android and click on Create.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.410
And it has provided me
list of patterns that

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.055
I can add as part of my
projects dot gitignore file.

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:50.460
We're already familiar with
majority of these patterns.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.070
All the lines with hash
would mean comments.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.290
Here we're trying to ignore
DOD Gradle directory.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.735
Here we are trying to
ignore the build directory.

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:07.475
So all the contents of it,

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:08.780
all the files as well as

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.930
the sub-directories would
be ignored for staging.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.290
Here we're trying to ignore

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.630
the local dot properties file.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.880
Star dot log would mean

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.860
we want to ignore
all the log files.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.350
And we've already seen
an example of the same.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.340
Similarly, we've got a
bunch of other patterns.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.139
Let's try typing in Node.

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:42.720
And let's see what it's
going to generate.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.990
Once again, we have bunch of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.490
patterns which you
might want to add

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:57.950
a new node JS project
has an assignment.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.230
Just copy one of these
files and try and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.810
experiment with these
patterns and see what

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.630
are all the files that are
being ignored and motor

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.920
all the files not getting
ignored. I'll see you next.
