00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Okay, Let's talk about this
branch prediction rule that

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.060
says required conversation
resolution before merging.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.570
And by the way, we're going
to ignore talking about

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.310
this option because this

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.170
has something to do
with external tools.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.915
And basically, if you want
to perform many kinds of

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:19.185
checks before merging the
code into another branch,

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.075
you'd want to enable this.

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:24.240
And talking about This is
definitely outside the scope of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.624
this particular course because

00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:29.640
this has something to
do with external tools.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.220
But generally speaking,
if you want to

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.300
perform any kind of checks
like vulnerability scan,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.620
are checking to see for

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.745
any programmatic
errors in the code.

00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:42.305
Our perform continuous
integration

00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:44.900
or maybe deploy the code
onto a build server,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.165
get the build status, et cetera.

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:49.625
If you want to work for
many such kind of things,

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:51.905
whenever somebody
raises a pull request,

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:53.690
you can configure them here.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.940
And this actually
completely depends on

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.860
your organization standards and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.615
we need to follow accordingly.

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:03.680
So maybe we'll cover all this
in other DevOps courses,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.110
but we're going to
ignore it for now.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.240
Let's get back to
this option that says

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.155
required criminalization
resolution before merging.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.030
Let me enable this option.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.940
Demonstrate to you
what it exactly means.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.800
So basically the men to
the password real quick.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.715
So this option is enabled.

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:39.890
Let me go to the pull requests

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.270
that we had raised earlier.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.430
And as you can see, we
can currently perform

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.820
the merge because of their
view is already done.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.010
But let's say that Mr. Luke has

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.485
one comment to add in the code.

00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:00.360
So let's go to Luke's account.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.285
Let me open up the file
from this pull request.

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:12.210
And let's say that we have
bunch of lines of code here.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.875
And Luke is putting
in some comment.

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:24.515
So maybe something like
something of that sort.

00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:26.705
Let me enlarge it a little bit.

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:29.225
So I want to add this command,

00:02:29.225 --> 00:02:33.695
and we're going to click
either of these buttons.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.690
Let me just add single comment.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.880
And since the fact
that we had enable

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.084
that branch protection
rule option,

00:02:40.084 --> 00:02:41.900
if I now go back to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.350
the pull request from
senders account,

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.120
let me reload the page.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.210
You're going to see that
the merge is blocked Once

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.410
again because there are
unresolved conversations.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.620
Let us assume that
sender has addressed

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.050
this comment and he's going to

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.110
mention the same
replying back to look.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.000
Yes, I have checked that.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.320
Something of that sort.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.930
That is once again, go
back to Luke's account.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.420
He's gone to see the reply here.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.610
And once you're satisfied
with the reply,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.930
Luke is going to resolve
the conversation.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:39.740
It is.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:49.410
Then sender can actually
merge the pull request.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.410
If this option is not enabled,

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.990
then conversation
dissolution is not

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.380
needed to merge the
code. I'll see you next.
