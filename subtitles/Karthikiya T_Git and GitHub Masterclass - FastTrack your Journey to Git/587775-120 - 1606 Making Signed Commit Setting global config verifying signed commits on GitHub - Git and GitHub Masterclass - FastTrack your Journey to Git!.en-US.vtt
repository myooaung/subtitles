00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Okay, let us see how
we can make assigned

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.355
commit and get them
verified on GitHub.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:08.895
I already have the mind
public CAP cloned here.

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:11.130
Let me open them, get bash

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.355
on the projects root directory.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:19.889
Let me first run the
command git config list.

00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:21.540
And as you can see,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.950
they use the name and

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.000
email are updated
to that of cinders,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.815
which is not ideal.

00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:30.705
Let's see what's going to happen

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:33.250
once we make assigned to commit.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.665
So let me create a random file,

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:41.680
something of that
sort. Let me stage it.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.155
And by the way, I'm not doing
this on the main branch.

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:47.150
I've just chosen
somewhat random branch.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.075
In this case, the
branch name is QQQ,

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:51.740
which will randomly created

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.780
in one of our previous lectures.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.780
Let me not try to make
assigned to commit.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.365
The command for
that is git commit.

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:02.285
Hyphen uppercase, Yes.

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:03.950
Make sure that
this is uppercase.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.305
Yes. Otherwise, this one walk.

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:08.480
If you want to sign
it tag though,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.640
then it has to be a lowercase.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.460
Yes. So hyphen uppercase yes.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.555
And hyphen md to provide
some message to this commit.

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:22.290
Let's call it my
commit or whatever.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.325
So commit has failed.

00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:28.850
And the message says that
there is no secret key.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.910
For Mr. Sunda.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.170
The user ID of the
key that we have

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.435
created is to that off Luke's.

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:40.220
But the good conflicts are

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.050
having the credentials
often though.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.060
They both did not match Enter.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.835
We're not able to make a
sign to commit in this case.

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:52.500
So let us quickly go ahead and
change the configurations.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.720
Username is going to

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:10.140
be GitHub, username of Luke.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.160
Similarly, we're going to
update the melodramas to that

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.620
of looks like so.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.140
Now let's try to make
assigned commit.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.980
For the first time you do it.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.830
You'd be asked to
enter the passphrase.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.480
I'm going to enter just that.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.410
Hit. Okay? And our
commit to successful.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.830
Let us try to now push
these changes to GitHub.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.520
So we're able to push
this commit that

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.790
has go to GitHub and see what
got reflected over there.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.925
So I'm currently in my
public app repository

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:59.195
and I'm in this branch, QQQ.

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:01.980
Let me reload the page.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.820
And as you can
see, we're able to

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.085
see the comment
that was just made.

00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:11.299
And this time it is
with verified badge.

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.350
So github is able to fetch
the public key of Mr. Luke,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.865
the author of The commit,

00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:21.035
to verify if the committee
is indeed done by Mr. Luke.

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:24.440
That's how the verification
process happens.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.385
If I were to remove the
public key from Mr. Luke,

00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:33.400
then the verified badge
would no longer be there.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.990
You might say Get up saying

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.300
that verification
is unsuccessful.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.075
And by the way, if
you do not want to do

00:03:43.075 --> 00:03:46.225
hyphen S option every time
you wanted to sign a commit,

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:49.700
we can actually introduce
a good conflict for that.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.125
So you're going
to say git config

00:03:53.125 --> 00:04:00.895
global climate dot JPG sign.

00:04:00.895 --> 00:04:03.235
And we're going to
set this to true.

00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:05.770
So every time you want
to make sign commit,

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.190
you don't have to explicitly
provide the hyphen S option.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.910
If you set this flag.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.945
Additionally, if you have
multiple private keys,

00:04:14.945 --> 00:04:16.625
to avoid ambiguity,

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:18.980
you also need to let them know

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.150
which private K12 use
to sign the commits.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.650
The conflict for that

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:34.190
is user signing key.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.710
And you're going to
provide the unique ID

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.970
of the key, GPG.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.330
Keys. You can provide this id.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.755
Like so. Let's say there's a
person with negative intent.

00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:11.480
He has created a private key
using Luke's credentials and

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.760
assume that he has even
pushed the commit to

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.730
the repository on
the GitHub site.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.620
Github will not
be able to verify

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.355
that commit using the public
key on Luke's account.

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:24.560
And that way get up
would be able to

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.090
verify that the committee

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.220
is not actually
coming from Mr. Luke.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.380
Hope it makes sense.
I'll see you next.
