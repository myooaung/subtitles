00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.460
Okay, let us see how we can keep

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.990
our local depository as well as

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.540
the forked repository in-sync

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.330
are up to date with the
original depository.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.150
In order to simulate
the behavior where

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.045
we have some new updates in
the original deposit today.

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:17.760
Let me actually go
to senders account.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.670
Who's the owner of
this repository.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.225
And let me make a commit
in the main branch,

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:28.200
maybe by just adding one file.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.560
Let's give it some random name.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.870
Something of that sort.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.370
Apple dot TXT.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.790
Sorry for the funny names.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.189
I just wanted to
keep things simple.

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:46.230
Let's create this file.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.830
So we have some new changes
in the original branch.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.795
Now there are
multiple ways to keep

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:55.760
our forked repository in

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.740
sync with the
original repository.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.330
The one that I'm
going to talk about

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.120
now is the easiest
approach off all.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.760
So let's now go to
Luke's GitHub account.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.935
Let's refresh the page.

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:13.170
So this is the
forked repository.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.180
Here you see a message
that says this branch is

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.660
one commit behind the cop main,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.650
which is the
original depository.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.360
And here you also
see an option to

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.245
sink fork. If you click on it.

00:01:29.245 --> 00:01:32.305
You'll see the option
to update the branch

00:01:32.305 --> 00:01:34.120
and do take a note that we're

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.310
currently in the main branch.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.770
So essentially the
main branch of

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.630
the forked repository is

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.515
compared with the main branch
of the original depository.

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:46.870
And that's how GitHub is telling

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.670
us that we are
actually one commit

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.055
behind the main branch of
the original depository.

00:01:54.055 --> 00:01:56.395
When you click on sync fork,

00:01:56.395 --> 00:01:59.725
you'll see the option to update
the branch, click on it.

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:03.440
So this would fetch
and merge our changes.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.420
And as you can see,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.730
we have that new file over here.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.195
Now, when it did
fetch and merge,

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:15.760
it is like pool operation.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.925
And that's going to result
in fast forward merge.

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:20.950
And there's no way
that we can get

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.080
conflicts here because
we're following

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.030
good practices of not

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.370
making our contributions
in the main branch.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.250
We created a feature
branch and that's where

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.825
we're bringing in
all the changes

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:33.610
were not touching
the main branch.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.025
So when we think both
the repositories,

00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:37.945
there's no way we're
going to see any kind of

00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:39.820
conflicts in case if you're

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.530
not following good practices

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.765
and you make comments
in your main branch,

00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:45.940
you might as well be
seeing conflicts and

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.525
then you have to deal
with those conflicts.

00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:51.545
Once you have it in
the remote repository,

00:02:51.545 --> 00:02:54.440
all you have to do is to pull

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.580
these changes even in
your local repository.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.680
Let's do that real quick.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.720
And as you can see,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.130
we got the updates from
default repository.
