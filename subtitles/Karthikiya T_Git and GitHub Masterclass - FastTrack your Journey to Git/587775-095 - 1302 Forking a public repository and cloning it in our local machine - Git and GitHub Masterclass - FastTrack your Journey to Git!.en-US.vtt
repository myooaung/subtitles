00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.730
Okay, let us see how we can fork

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.490
a repository to
start contributing.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.970
Now imagine that this is
Luke's computer and he's

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.320
willing to contribute to one of

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.855
the open-source projects
available online.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.600
So let me go to Luke's
GitHub account.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.130
And here it is.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.540
And assume that this is

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.765
the project that Luke is
willing to contribute to.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:25.890
This project is actually owned
by Mr. cylinder and look,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.800
does not have the right
access to this project or

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.030
he's not added as one of

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.685
the collaborators
for this project.

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:34.875
This time, since loop

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:37.170
cannot directly contribute
to this project,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.330
what is going to do is,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.625
is actually going to create
a fork of this project.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.545
So here you see an
option that says ****,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:46.835
you can add the click here.

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:48.950
I'll click on the
drop-down menu.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.060
And you see an option that
says Create a New Fork.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.430
Hey, the way you'd be taken to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.560
this page where you will

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.410
be asked to give a name
for your repository.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.270
You can keep the same name

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.370
as with the original depository,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.265
or you can rename it
to something else.

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:10.265
For example, maybe looks,

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:12.800
app or whatever, doesn't matter.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.320
Optionally, you can also
provide description and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.810
click on this button
that says create fork.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.000
So essentially we have
created a clone of

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.735
the original project on
Luke's GitHub account.

00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:29.870
And Luke can now do
everything what he would

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.560
otherwise do on his
own public repository.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.260
And the fact that
this is actually

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.755
a clone or a forked version
of some other repository.

00:01:39.755 --> 00:01:43.055
You're going to see all the
commit history is branches.

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:44.660
Everything is as is,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.285
except for a forked repository.

00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:49.085
You're going to see this icon

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:51.860
signifying that this is
a forked repository.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.010
And also this text
that says forked

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.915
from the cop 1996
slash my public cap,

00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:02.300
which is the
original depository.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.840
Solute, can now start
contributing to this project.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.660
He can even add
additional collaborators.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.580
If Luke is having a team of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.260
developers who might be

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.390
wanting to contribute
to this project.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.630
You can add collaborators
or branch protection rules.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.290
Everything what one can do
with a public repository.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.905
You can do the same even
with the forked repository.

00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:32.840
Except of course
you're going to see

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.140
a difference of the
original deposited here.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.480
This reference will
come in handy at

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.250
later stage and we're going to

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.829
talk about it in
upcoming lectures.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.095
For now. Let us try to
clone this project.

00:02:48.095 --> 00:02:52.325
Let's copy the HTTPS URL.

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:56.390
Inside looks computer
has just simply going to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.320
clone his own repository.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.090
Git clone and paste the URL.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.340
Let me go into
that directory cd.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.305
And let me type in
the command git

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:24.590
remote hyphen v
stands for verbose.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.960
As you can see, it
has already added one

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.570
remote with the name origin,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.885
and it is pointing to
the forked repository.

00:03:32.885 --> 00:03:34.865
So when I say origin,

00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:37.460
I'm actually referring to
the forked repository.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.260
And down the line would also

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.075
be required to add
another remote,

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:42.650
which is upstream remote.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.490
And that points to the
original repository

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.230
will continue from next one.
