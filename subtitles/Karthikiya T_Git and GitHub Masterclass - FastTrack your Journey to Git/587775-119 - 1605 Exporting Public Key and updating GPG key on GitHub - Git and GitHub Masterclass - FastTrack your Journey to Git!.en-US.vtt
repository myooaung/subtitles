00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
Okay, Now that we have created
public and private keys,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.070
let us now try to export

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.870
the public key so that

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.330
we can put it on
Luke's GitHub account.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.125
And the command for that is,
you're going to set GPG.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.465
Hyphenate stands for armor.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:17.490
This option is to
export the key in

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.205
ascii or mode format
instead of binary.

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.260
And then we're
going to say dash,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.770
dash, export it to
export the key.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.505
And then we're going
to specify the key ID.

00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:33.060
Now what is the key ID from
our previous commands?

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.890
If you notice, where we have

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.295
verified the public key
and private key creation,

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:41.615
it has also printed the key ID.

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:43.640
And if you notice,
the key idea of

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.940
both public and private
keys are exactly the same.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.190
That's because the
private key do

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.575
not have a separate
key ideas such.

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:53.240
And so GPG is just showing

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.020
the public key ID that the
private key is paid to.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.800
I'm just simply going to
copy this identifier.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.120
Alternatively, you can also
use UID stands for User ID,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.775
and we can use the same as well.

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:10.519
But it's generally recommended

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:14.464
that you use the key
ID instead of the UID.

00:01:14.464 --> 00:01:16.520
Because long story short,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.090
it might cause conflicts
if you have a KeyStore.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.780
So let's use this to
export the public key.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.675
We can copy the text from
begin PGP public key block.

00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:41.540
All the way to

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.010
this point where we see

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.755
the text and PGP
public key block.

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:47.915
I'm simply going to copy it.

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:51.395
Alternatively, you can
run the same command.

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:53.885
And using angular brace,

00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:57.485
we can actually export the
public key on their file.

00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:00.214
Public dot key, for instance,

00:02:00.214 --> 00:02:03.575
where the public you
would be exported.

00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:08.790
If you wish, you can also
export the private key.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.145
At the moment. We
don't have to do that.

00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:15.980
But I'm just demonstrating
how we can do that.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.470
So instead of
saying just export,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.100
we're going to say
export dash secret key.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.655
And this would export
private key as well.

00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:30.275
And when you do that,

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:31.910
you're going to get
a prompt asking

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.770
you to enter the passphrase.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.580
In my case, it's just for
character passphrase.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.235
What are the passphrase
you have created?

00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:42.900
Intended that here.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.350
Once I hit Okay,

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.920
we have the private key
dumped into this file.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.250
So let's see if we can go there.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.415
If I open up this directory,

00:02:58.415 --> 00:03:02.090
you're going to see
these two files created.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.860
Let's open public dot key
file with Notepad Plus, Plus.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.275
And you're going to
see the same text

00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:11.900
that were seen on Git Bash.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.555
I'm simply going to copy this.

00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:18.545
And I'm now going to go
to Luke's GitHub account.

00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:21.335
This is looks GitHub account.

00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:23.975
I'm going to click on this icon.

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:26.120
And if you scroll down a bit,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.580
you're going to see Settings.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.275
Click on that. And on
the left-hand side menu,

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:41.010
click on, click on
SSH and GPG keys.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.745
And here you see option.

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:50.360
To give a new GPG key.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.150
Under key section,
you're going to

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.210
paste mortar have just
copied the public key,

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.940
optional Ignacio title,
and click on Add GPG key.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.080
Next we're going to
see how we can sign

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.840
the commits. I'll see you next.
