00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Alright, let us see
how we can perform

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.025
git rebase from Git Bash.

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:07.410
Currently we're in master
branch me to switch to

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.960
feature one branch to be
able to run that command.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.960
And by the way, have brought
back the project back

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.640
to how it looked like

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.100
at the beginning of
our previous video.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.530
So that we can redo
things and see

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.825
how it works from Git Bash.

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:27.010
I'm going to switch
to feature branch.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.160
It can simultaneously
observe what's

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.130
happening in this graph.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.510
Git rebase.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.660
Where do I want to
rebase to do a commit?

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.295
That master branch is pointing
to someone to say Master.

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:48.875
And as you can expect,

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:50.810
we're going to see
the conflicts.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.030
Let us go ahead
and dissolve them.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.500
In my guess, once again,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.700
I wouldn't accept both the
changes, save the file,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.125
and go back to Git Bash,

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.060
went to stage that file,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.955
git add product dot TXT file.

00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:11.940
And then we need to
run this command.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.740
Git rebase, hyphen, hyphen

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.030
continue to continue
performing the rebase.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.490
And I'm going to do just that.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.700
You also have the
option to skip.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.875
If you run this command,

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:28.990
git will just simply skip

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.465
the commit that is
causing the conflicts.

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:33.070
It is as though you haven't made

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.450
the commenting feature branch

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.340
that is causing the conflicts.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.915
If you run this command,

00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:40.705
maybe after successfully
performing the rebase,

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:44.319
you may want to reapply all
those changes manually.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.350
However, since we have
resolved the complex,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.105
you don't have to
use this option,

00:01:49.105 --> 00:01:51.355
but feel free to
experiment with it.

00:01:51.355 --> 00:01:54.200
Once I run this command.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.985
Again, it's going to
show us the message.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.275
We can keep it as it is.

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:01.640
Or if you wish to change it,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.965
you can go ahead and change it.

00:02:03.965 --> 00:02:11.030
Let's close. And as
you can see here,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.110
we have rebased
our feature branch

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.254
with the master branch.

00:02:17.254 --> 00:02:20.150
Let's now go ahead and
perform the merge part,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.470
which we're going
to switch back to

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.370
master git

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.360
merge feature one.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.430
And as you can see,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.310
both the branches are matched.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.220
If a bone from git
log command now,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.300
you're going to see all
the commits introduced in

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.820
both the branches
in linear fashion,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.350
which is what we need.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.385
And by the way, well-performing
rebase operation.

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:58.070
And for some reason you
have decided to abort it,

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.885
then you can use this option,

00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:03.510
git rebase, hyphen,
hyphen I bought.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.900
I'll see you next.
