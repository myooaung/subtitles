00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.365
Okay, let's see how we can
create GitHub repositories.

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:06.690
We can add that important
existing repository.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.965
I'll create a new one.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.200
And I'm going to do just that.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.190
Here.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.905
You're going to see
the name of the owner.

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:16.500
In this case, we
just have one owner.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.155
And that is what is
chosen by default.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:21.540
Here you have to provide
the repository name,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.570
the name of the repository
that you'd like to do.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.910
Now, we have to make up
your mind whether you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.295
want to make the project
public or private.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.564
If your aim is to initiate
an open-source project,

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:34.830
then it might make sense for you

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.285
to choose the
public option here.

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:39.170
Or if you're an
organization where

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.850
your software or
the application is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.205
proprietary and you have

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:45.350
a client for whom
you're working for,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.150
then it might make more sense to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.685
use a private repository.

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:51.755
If it is a public repository,

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:53.930
anybody from across
the globe would be

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.540
able to view the content
of your project,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.365
download your project,
clone it, et cetera.

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:02.855
Whereas if the
repository's private,

00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:04.580
you can choose as to who can do

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.710
what you can contribute
to the project,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.764
who can view the project, etc.

00:01:08.764 --> 00:01:10.970
I'm going to demonstrate
the creation of both.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.760
The repository is assuming that

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.850
I'm creating some kind of
an open source project.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.100
Let me call my app as my
public app or whatever.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.660
If you wish. You can also

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.075
separate these names
with a hyphen.

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:28.280
You cannot have a
whitespace character.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.680
If you do include
whitespace character,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.104
then get would automatically
assume a hyphen character,

00:01:35.104 --> 00:01:37.205
like it is suggesting.

00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:39.740
By the way, I might
use the word Git and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.619
GitHub interchangeably
depending on the context.

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.915
So this is the name of
the app which I've given.

00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:49.260
I can also write a quick
description about the project,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.900
my public app, whatever.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.195
And then get up. It's showing us

00:01:56.195 --> 00:01:58.910
options to include
some of these files,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.395
like Read Me file,

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:04.550
which would have some
details about the project.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.335
The dot ignore file,

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.120
essentially whatever
the file patterns

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.455
you include in this file,

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:12.930
would be ignored
to be committed.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.370
Then we can also choose
the license file.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.145
There are certain
predefined licenses

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:21.455
which we can use if we wish.

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:24.440
For example, if you're creating
an open-source project,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.455
than gpu or general
public license

00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:29.540
might make sense to you.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.450
For the time being, I'm
not going to choose any of

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.655
these because we
can add them later.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.425
But if you choose one of these,

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:38.945
then get will automatically
create a commit

00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:42.020
on our behalf
committing these files.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.920
It's your choice.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.675
You can choose it
or not choose it.

00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:45.905
Both are pretty much same.

00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:49.565
We're going to add them
anyway in coming lectures.

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:51.290
So this is just simply going to

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.985
create a public repository.

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:56.300
Let's click on
Create Repository.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.370
And GitHub is providing

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.070
some next steps which
you don't have to

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.080
bother about because we're
going to explore them

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.675
anyway in coming lectures.

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:10.640
But if you go back here,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.045
you can see that our
repository is listed here.

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:16.860
If you copy the link,

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.685
the link would look
something like this.

00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:24.380
You have GitHub.com and
then the username slash,

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.150
the name of the repository.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.250
And that's how everybody
would be able to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.500
access your public repository.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.650
Now, anybody across the
globe can actually hit

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.960
this link to be able to view

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.570
Watson's our project
because it is public.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.620
Let's now also create
a private repository.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.850
You click on new name of the
repository is going to be

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.509
say, bank app, whatever.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.220
My banking application,
I'm going to

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.250
choose the option private,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.220
so that only the people
that I give access

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.760
to be able to view the
project and contribute to it.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.910
I'm actually talking
about collaborators,

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.655
which we will
explore pretty soon.

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:18.425
This time.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.605
Let me maybe choose
one of these files.

00:04:21.605 --> 00:04:25.460
Maybe I would like to
add a license file.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.480
For instance.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.279
This probably cannot be a
general public license.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.260
But you can use just anything.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.930
You don't have to be really
serious about it unless you

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.260
are a real organization who
is worried about licensing.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.330
I'm just simply
choosing something

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.270
random and create repository.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.095
This time, github has
made one commit for us.

00:04:57.095 --> 00:05:01.805
And in that committed has
committed the license file.

00:05:01.805 --> 00:05:05.765
You can click on that file to
take a look at its content.

00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:09.260
You can change this if you
wish and make another commit.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.910
But we're going to explore all
that in upcoming lectures.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.520
Let's go back to the homepage.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.375
And now you can see
these two repositories.

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:23.255
Now since this is a
private repository,

00:05:23.255 --> 00:05:26.225
this cannot be accessed
by anybody else.

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:29.525
Unfortunately, private
repositories and GitHub

00:05:29.525 --> 00:05:31.220
doesn't have a lot of features

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.080
that public repositories have.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.185
If you want those features
and private repositories.

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:38.750
And more, hint actually consider

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.245
taking some of the paid
tiers offered by GitHub.

00:05:42.245 --> 00:05:44.225
Unless you are an organization,

00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:47.015
it doesn't really make sense
for you to pay for them.

00:05:47.015 --> 00:05:49.760
And for that very reason,
for the most part,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.915
we're going to be using

00:05:50.915 --> 00:05:54.110
the public repository
in this course.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.340
I'll see you next.
