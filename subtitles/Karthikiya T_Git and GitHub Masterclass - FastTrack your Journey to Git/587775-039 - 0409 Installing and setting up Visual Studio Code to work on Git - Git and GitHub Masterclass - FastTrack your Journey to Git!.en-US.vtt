00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Okay, it's time to install
it to and use one of

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.100
the tools available to help us

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.185
manage our project
in a better manner,

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:10.215
because we cannot just keep
on using Windows file system

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:13.050
and Git Bash to work
on our project.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.925
As a project gets more complex,

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:16.860
we need some kind of
a tool that will help

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.050
us manage our project
in a better manner

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.310
and be able to view some of

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.340
the historical changes or
list of commits we had done.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.125
Take a look at list of branches

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.910
while also being able
to perform some of

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.250
the operations without having

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.095
to run commands in the Git Bash.

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:33.914
So there are lots of
tools available online

00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:35.880
and there's no single tool

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.145
that is fit for
all kind of thing.

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:40.320
If you go to the official
website of gate,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.525
which is Git SCM.com,
python SCM.com.

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:47.150
And if you go to this
section grid lines,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.610
you're going to see
that they've listed are

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.609
recommending all these tools.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.915
If you use any of these tool,

00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:58.850
it shouldn't be
hard for you to use

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.115
any of the other
tools available here.

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:03.290
Because although
they differ in terms

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.285
of graphical user interface,

00:01:05.285 --> 00:01:09.210
they pretty much offered the
same exact functionality.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.565
Github, desktop and source tree,

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:16.265
or two of the most
popular choices.

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:19.925
But we're going to be
using Visual Studio Code.

00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:22.700
The reason why I'm
recommending this is

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.230
because Visual
Studio Code is one

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.000
of the popular code editors.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.740
It is one of the
popular choice as to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.749
develop JavaScript
Python applications,

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:31.205
and it has support for

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:33.710
host of other
programming languages.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.485
But what differentiates
Visual Studio code

00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:37.970
from some of these tools are

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.170
valuable here is that its
ability to install extensions.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.665
And that's how we're going
to install a good extension.

00:01:45.665 --> 00:01:48.170
And that will give you some
of the features offered

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.870
by some of these tools.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.400
These tools in here.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.255
Visual Studio Code is
more of a holistic tool,

00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:02.690
rather than just aiming
at get specifically.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.170
Once you're used to using
Visual Studio Code,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.970
it should be very
easy for you to

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.210
understand some of
these tools AND gates.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.875
If you want to choose
one of these tools,

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:14.150
then you can go ahead and do

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.085
that if you're
comfortable with that.

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:18.080
But I'm going to be using

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.225
Visual Studio Code with
a quick Google search.

00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:25.805
We got to this page.

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:27.815
Go ahead and download
Visual Studio,

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:30.290
depending on the operating
system you're using.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.210
I've already done that.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.129
Let me launch the installer.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.110
Installing it is pretty
straightforward.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.430
You can just leave everything to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.820
the defaults unless you
want to change something.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.695
Okay, it's installed.

00:02:48.695 --> 00:02:51.930
Let's launch Visual Studio Code.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.200
First things first, let
us go to the Explorer and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.925
when to open up the project
by clicking on Open Folder.

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:10.290
I'm going to choose my app
that we had created earlier.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.330
In addition to that,
I'm going to go to

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.835
the section called extensions.

00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:19.740
I would search for Get.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.895
Get lens is one of
the popular choices.

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:32.880
Get graph is also a good
choice. Let us install it.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.510
Alright, in the next video,

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.920
we're going to see
how we can handle

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.275
merge conflicts in
Visual Studio code.

00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:44.150
So that will give
you some exposure to

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.130
Visual Studio Code as well as

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.040
mob the get operations
we can perform on it.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.720
I'll see you next one.
