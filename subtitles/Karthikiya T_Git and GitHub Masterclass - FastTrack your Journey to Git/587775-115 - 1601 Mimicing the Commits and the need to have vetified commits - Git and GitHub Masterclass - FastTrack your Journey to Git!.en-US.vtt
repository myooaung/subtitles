00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.914
Now let me demonstrate to
something really interesting.

00:00:03.914 --> 00:00:07.245
I'm sure you'd be surprised
to see this happening.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:09.270
For the sake of this example,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.850
I'm going to be using one of
the existing repositories

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.445
that we've been using
throughout this course.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:15.870
In case if you lost hold of

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.700
what this repository is about.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.900
Just think of this as

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.290
some random repository
with bunch of files in it.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.650
Currently this project has
these two collaborators.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.215
We have sender who is the
owner of the repository,

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:30.260
and Luke, who is one

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.660
of the collaborators
of this project.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.239
Also for the sake
of this example,

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.445
I have disabled branch
production rules

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:38.600
for the main branch.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.940
And hence you're seeing
this message that says

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.150
your main branch
isn't protected.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.070
Now a question to you.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.130
Is it possible that Mr.
Luke make a comment on

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.040
behalf of cylinder without
taking his consent?

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.285
Well, let's take a look.

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:59.449
Imagine that this is
Mr. Luke's computer.

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.325
And to save your time,

00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:03.230
I've already cloned the project.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.060
Let me open up Git Bash here.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.135
Let me run the
command git config

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:17.095
lest to take a look at the
current configurations.

00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:18.940
And as you can see,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.630
username and email are off.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.750
Mr. Luke's username is Luke's in

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.550
the Corp and email address
is looks email address.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.240
Let me try changing
them to Saunders.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.780
I'm going to say git
config global username.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:49.720
I'm going to give the same
dose GitHub username, like so.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.675
And similarly, we're
also going to change

00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:55.400
the e-mail address and

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.249
update it with some
those e-mail address.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.080
I can easily get this in
this name and email address.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.225
But on in the git log command.

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:09.830
And taking a look at some of

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.825
the comments done
by Mr. cylinder.

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:14.645
Now if I do git config list,

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:16.760
you're going to see that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.290
the username and the
e-mail address or no,

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.150
updated with cylinders is a
name and his email address.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.950
Let me now try to make

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.925
a commit and see what's
going to happen.

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:36.720
Let me quickly create a
file with some random name.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.539
And I'm going to stay as
that file real quick,

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:44.440
git add name of the file.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.890
And finally git commit
with some message.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.800
Let's call it wrong commit.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.040
And I'm also going to push

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.650
these changes to the
GitHub repository.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.750
Now let's go to GitHub
and take a look

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.065
at how things got
reflected over there.

00:03:08.065 --> 00:03:11.480
I'm currently in
the main branch.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.175
Let me reload the page
and go to commit.

00:03:18.175 --> 00:03:20.990
And as you can see,
we're able to see

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.770
the commit that was
just made by Mr. Luke.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.155
But if you notice what
is being shown here,

00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:31.520
it says this commit
has been made by Mr.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.395
Sunda and it is pointing
to cinders profile.

00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:38.900
Interestingly enough,
some that does not have

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.585
any clue that this
comment has been made.

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:43.940
For somebody who looks
at the commit history.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.500
They're going to think
that this committee is

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.540
actually made by sunder all day,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.405
does not him who has
actually made this comment.

00:03:50.405 --> 00:03:52.445
This is happening because good

00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:54.650
assumes that what
are they using them?

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.090
An e-mail address
that was set in

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.310
configurations is
the same person

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.900
who is actually
making the commit.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.255
However, that may
not be the case.

00:04:02.255 --> 00:04:05.120
And I've just
demonstrated it for you.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.535
This doesn't necessarily
have to be done

00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:10.235
by existing collaborators
of the project.

00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:12.515
Some random person
for the project,

00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:13.880
and raise the pull request with

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.500
bunch of commits mimicking

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.970
that those comments
were actually done

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.635
by some other user,

00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:19.910
which is obviously not

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.740
something we would
expect to happen.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.020
So we need some sort of
verification process

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.730
in place that checks to

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.860
see if the commit author

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.695
is the same person who has
actually made the committee.

00:04:30.695 --> 00:04:34.445
And that's where verified
commits will come into picture.

00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:37.530
And that's what we're
going to talk about next.
