00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, let us see how we
can download, install,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.925
and configure, get on
our local enrollment.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:08.700
Now assume that I'm a
freelancer and I got

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
a very small project which
I feel I can walk alone.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.595
Forget about team collaboration,

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:17.505
forget about multiple people
involved in the project.

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:20.220
Forget about GitHub
for the time being.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.505
Let's just stay focused on get.

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:26.610
So go to Google and
search for download,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.400
get on the first link,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.455
but makes sure that it
belongs to the website.

00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:32.015
Get hyphen SCM.

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:34.970
That's the official
website of get.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.770
Once you're there, depending on

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.555
the operating system
you're using,

00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:40.325
click on the relevant link.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:42.455
Now by the time you're
viewing this page,

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:44.165
you might see a
different layout.

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:45.485
But you got the point.

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:47.330
You just have to click the
link that is specific to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.640
your operating system.
I'm using Windows.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.355
In my case, if
you're using macOS,

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:54.710
there are a separate
set of instructions for

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.050
the same. Just follow them.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.110
And while installing,
you can leave everything

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.350
to the defaults and proceed
with the installation.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.510
And it's not necessary
that you understand

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.849
each and every step
while installing.

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:09.875
That's perfectly normal.

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:13.445
In case if you have any problem
installing in macOS sets,

00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:16.190
do get in touch with us and
we'll be able to help you.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.930
But since I'm using Windows,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.570
I'm going to click this here.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.250
I basically got
couple of options.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.970
The first of which is the
installer version of Git,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.850
and the other is the
portable version of Git.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.770
If I download portable version,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.920
I can start using Git without
having to install it.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.510
And this might come in handy,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.860
especially if I want to work on

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.900
multiple computers and I don't

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.480
want to install Git on
each and every computer.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.420
I can just dump all these
files onto a pen drive or

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.400
a thumb drive and then start

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.920
using good on all
those computers.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.215
But I'm going to
go with installer.

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:52.850
I'm using 64-bit OS,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.995
so I'm going to click on this.

00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:57.320
Well, for Linux and Mac users,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.615
you might already be
having Git installed.

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:01.985
You can just verify it
by running a command.

00:02:01.985 --> 00:02:03.845
I'm going to show you
that command in a while.

00:02:03.845 --> 00:02:06.320
Or you might already be
having those libraries,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.865
so you just have
to install them.

00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:09.260
You can defer to
the installation

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.400
instructions for the same.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.365
So I have this downloaded.

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:18.380
Let's now start the
installation process.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.480
If you have patients go
through this entire license,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.190
I don't have so
much of patients,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.275
I just clicked Next.

00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:28.630
Now, while installing Git,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.925
you might come across
with certain steps,

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:32.320
are certain prompts, are

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.785
certain terminologies that
doesn't sound familiar to you.

00:02:35.785 --> 00:02:38.830
It's perfectly alright.
As a rule of thumb,

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.810
just remember,
keep everything to

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.125
their defaults and proceed
with the installation.

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:46.630
It's not necessary that
you understand each and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.315
every step in this
installation process.

00:02:49.315 --> 00:02:52.030
Since I have worked on
it for a long time.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.315
I understand what is
being asked here.

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:57.440
But for you, you don't have
to understand everything.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.240
I would only walk you
through the steps

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.770
that I feel you'd be able to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.630
understand based on the level of

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.700
knowledge you've gained
so far in this course.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.245
So I could just leave
everything to the defaults.

00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:12.950
But what this prompt is
basically asking us is it

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.090
is asking us to choose

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.835
the components that
we want to install.

00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:19.645
We're going to talk about
Git Bash and get go.

00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:21.050
In the next lecture.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.880
You can just ignore and

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.190
keep rest of this
stuff to the defaults.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.020
We don't want to get
into too much detail.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.860
It's not what that here it
is basically asking you to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.260
choose a software to
edit dot get files.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.544
I have installed Notepad
Plus Plus in my computer,

00:03:39.544 --> 00:03:41.600
and I can choose that.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.430
And I would also
recommend you to use

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.335
the same software.
It is open source.

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:47.240
You don't have to pay
anything for that.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.430
Download Notepad Plus, Plus,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.185
it's an amazing tool.

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:53.359
Choose that and click Next.

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.550
Leave this to
default because you

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.040
don't know what is a branch
at this point in time.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.020
So it doesn't make
sense for me to

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.945
explain you about this step.

00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:06.560
So we're going to
leave this to default.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.230
Okay, in this tab
is basically asking

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.210
us whether are we going to use

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.400
Git Bash only or are we also

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.965
going to use the command
line of windows?

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:18.694
This step is
specific to Windows.

00:04:18.694 --> 00:04:21.605
You may not be seeing
similar installation steps.

00:04:21.605 --> 00:04:26.060
Effort installing Git on
other OS like Linux or macOS,

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.560
you might be seeing
a different set

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.435
of instructions altogether.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.340
But like I said,
leave everything to

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.430
their defaults and
finish installation.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.070
But here if I
choose this option,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.180
get is actually going to
add a path variable in

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.120
system enrollment variables
so that we can start

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.930
using Git commands on
Windows command processor.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.250
If you choose this option.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.560
However, it's not
going to do that with

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.815
an assumption that would
only be using Git Bash.

00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:56.705
Again, we're going to
talk about Git Bash,

00:04:56.705 --> 00:04:59.760
get gray in next lecture.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.100
Next, I'm going to
leave this to default.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.029
Basically.

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.730
It is asking if they want to use

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.010
the existing OpenSSH or

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.170
if you already have
it installed some.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.330
You can just point to it.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.550
But we're going to
use the OpenSSH

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.355
that comes along
bundled with good.

00:05:21.355 --> 00:05:24.190
By the way, openness that
would essentially allow you

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.535
to connect to the remote
machine in a secure manner.

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:30.980
More on it in coming
lectures for sure.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.790
Leave this to default as well.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.300
Obviously, you don't
understand what

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.055
is combat or this checkout,

00:05:39.055 --> 00:05:42.370
so I cannot explain you
anything about this right now.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.595
Leave it to default.

00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:47.345
Leave the default.

00:05:47.345 --> 00:05:50.000
Okay, this talking
about git pull.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.760
Again, this is too advanced
for you to understand.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.575
Just leave everything
to the defaults.

00:05:54.575 --> 00:05:55.760
I'm British or you may not be

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.400
understanding all
the steps in here.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.175
Don't even try to understand
it's not necessary.

00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:03.950
We're going to explore
everything in coming lectures.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.480
It's perfectly normal.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.590
If you don't understand,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.150
that's perfectly all right.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.710
Trust me.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.820
Hit Next. Enable
file system caching.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.040
Yes, we want to, that
would improve performance.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.574
We can unselect this
too and hit Install.

00:06:21.574 --> 00:06:29.420
Wait for a bit. Alright, I

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.420
don't want to read
the release notes.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.960
Head finish. Okay, we

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.380
have now installed on
our local machine.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.455
Let's go and verify.

00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:45.335
If it indeed got installed.

00:06:45.335 --> 00:06:49.020
I'm window open, Windows
command processor.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.375
And then type in get.

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:57.920
If you're able to see
an output like this.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.520
That means get was
installed successfully.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.590
And the reason we're able
to run git command from

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.600
Windows command processor is

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.800
because somewhere in the middle

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.405
of the installation process,

00:07:11.405 --> 00:07:14.360
we had asked to get to include

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.810
path variable of get in
Windows enrollment variables.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.130
Let me show you what I mean.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.410
Search for enrollment variables.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.800
Click on Edit System
enrollment variables.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.240
If you go to path.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.219
Here you would see
path to get library.

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:48.800
So whenever you run command,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.895
something like that
will just run.

00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:55.220
Windows OS is actually
going to take a look

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.770
at all these parts
listed in here.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.770
And then it come across
with this part where it has

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.430
the code to do something
with GET command.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.295
And hence we're able
to see this output.

00:08:07.295 --> 00:08:08.900
If you remove this,

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.375
we wouldn't be able to
run any Git commands from

00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:13.640
Windows command
processor unless we

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.520
explicitly go to this
directory and do that.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.850
Anyway, if all this sounds
confusing, just simply ignore,

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.440
trust me, you're going to

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.270
understand everything
in coming lectures.
