00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.060
Okay, let us see how we can push

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.520
our local changes or
the local commits to

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.670
the remote repository so that
everybody else in the team

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.850
can actually download those
changes and use them all,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.205
start walking on top of them.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.710
Now in order to
explain things better,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.810
let us clean things up and do

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.360
everything from scratch
as if somebody has

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.580
just joined the team and willing

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.355
to contribute to our repository.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.680
First things first, let me

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.630
login as the owner
of the repository.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.054
I've logged in as Sunda.

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:37.125
This is Saunders GitHub account.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:41.680
And here's the owner of
this public repository.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.700
I go to settings and
then I'm going to

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.300
add Mr. Luke as a collaborator.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.850
I'm expecting some
contribution from Mr.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.850
Luke to this repository.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.765
As you can see, we
have just added

00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:11.480
Mr. Luke as the collaborator.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.750
I also have deleted

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.065
all the branches we
had created earlier,

00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:20.440
except I left the
main branch as is.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.020
So we currently have one branch.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.255
All of the branches
were just deleted.

00:01:25.255 --> 00:01:29.810
Just so that we'll understand
everything clean and clear.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.134
Now let's go to Luke's account.

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:36.070
You can tell that this is

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.220
Luke's account because
this has the white theme.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.890
Here is the email
that's under has

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.050
received to accept
the invitation

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.140
to be a collaborator
on that project.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.030
I'm going to do just that.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.510
The next thing that
loop needs to do is

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.760
to copy the HTTPS link
and clone the project.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.930
For this purpose of
actually created

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.240
a new directory
with the name get.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.855
And this is where we're going
to experiment with things.

00:02:16.855 --> 00:02:19.700
Let me launch Git Bash here.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.960
And let's clone the
project git clone.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.930
And then I'm going
to paste the URL.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.340
This is going to
clone the repository.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.685
One another thing
we need to make

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:39.850
sure is about the credentials.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.980
Let's type in the command git

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.900
config list option so

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.060
that we can see all
the configurations.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.515
And as you can see,
the username is

00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:56.090
my name and the email is
something different, not Luke's.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.460
Now this is not a
mandatory thing

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.575
that you need to update
these credentials.

00:03:00.575 --> 00:03:03.095
But what are the credentials
that you give here

00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:06.485
is what would get reflected
in concrete objects as well.

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:08.495
So when you make local commits,

00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:10.850
these credentials
would be recorded and

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.960
same credentials would be

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.270
seen even on the
remote repository.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.040
Once after you push
all those commits

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.750
to the remote repository,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.900
it makes more sense to
have Luke's credentials

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.400
here because he is the one who

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.170
is contributing to
the repository.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.440
So let us go ahead and
change these credentials.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.315
User.name.

00:03:32.315 --> 00:03:35.045
I'm going to give
the same username

00:03:35.045 --> 00:03:38.460
has with the Luke's
GitHub account.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:47.790
That is also change the
e-mail to Luke's email.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.365
Like so. Now if you
check the credentials,

00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:57.785
you can see that those
who are updated.

00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:00.320
Now let us assume that
Luke was given with

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.035
the task to work on feature one.

00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:05.240
Guess what he's going to do?

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.805
Well, he would create
another branch

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:11.285
and contribute all the changes
related to feature one.

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:13.730
Let's do that real quick.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.325
I'm going to do that
from Visual Studio code.

00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:17.225
If you wish.

00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:19.950
You can do it from
Git Bash as well.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.450
I'm going to open up the
folder with VS Code.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.820
And maybe I'll just add
one additional file.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.824
But before that, we need
to create a branch.

00:04:35.824 --> 00:04:39.140
As you can see currently
we are in main branch.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.595
Let me click on it and let
me type in feature one.

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:45.335
We don't have this branch yet.

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:48.499
We don't have this branch even
in the remote repository.

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.720
Let me go ahead and choose

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.120
this option to create
this branch for us.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.075
Visual Studio Code has
created this branch,

00:04:59.075 --> 00:05:02.090
and it has also switch
to that branch.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.420
Now let me go ahead
and add one file.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.720
Let's call it product dot TXT.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.895
Line one, feature one,

00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:16.175
something of that sort.

00:05:16.175 --> 00:05:20.315
I'm going to use the same
text as the commit message.

00:05:20.315 --> 00:05:23.135
Let us enter the message

00:05:23.135 --> 00:05:27.720
and commit these changes in
local feature one branch.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:35.660
Let us maybe also make one
more comment line to like

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:43.100
so when to copy

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.420
it and have it as the
message for this comet.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.390
Let's take a look at the graph.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.790
As you can see, we
have the main branch

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.875
here and feature branch,

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:04.550
which is a couple of comments
ahead of the main branch.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.890
Let us assume that Luke has done

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.915
whatever he needs to
do for feature one.

00:06:08.915 --> 00:06:11.495
He has tested all
those changes locally.

00:06:11.495 --> 00:06:14.000
And now he's willing
to contribute

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.730
or push all these commits
to the remote repository.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.820
How he's going to do that is
something we'll talk next.
