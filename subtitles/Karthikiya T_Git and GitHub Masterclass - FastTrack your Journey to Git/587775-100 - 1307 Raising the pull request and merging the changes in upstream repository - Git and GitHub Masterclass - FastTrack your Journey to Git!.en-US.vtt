00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
Let us see how Luke can
propose this changes to

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.070
surrender by raising
a pull request.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.185
There are multiple
ways to do so.

00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:10.150
Here you already see an option

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.535
to compare and raise
the pull request.

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:15.040
You can either click
here or you can

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.190
choose the feature
branch in the list.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.690
Then click on the drop-down
menu under contribute,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.499
and you see the same option
to open a pull request.

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.080
Alternatively, you
can also go to pull

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.285
requests section and
raise a new pull request.

00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:36.205
Whichever way you follow,

00:00:36.205 --> 00:00:39.370
you're going to see the
screen where we need

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.215
to compare the branches to see
the difference of the two.

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:45.770
Here we're going to compare
the main branch off

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.710
upstream repository
with the feature branch

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.840
of the forked repository.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.270
The repository here is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.270
referring to the
upstream repository.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.970
And here we have chosen
the main branch.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.740
The head repository here is

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.765
pointing to the
forked repository.

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:06.680
And here we need to choose
the feature branch.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.140
So this is going
to show a summary

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.250
of all the changes we have

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.355
just introduced in
the feature branch.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:17.915
We can now just go ahead and
create the pull request.

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:20.540
The process is pretty
much similar to

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.120
the pull request process
we had talked earlier.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.555
So once after pull
request is raised,

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:31.820
they can actually
review the changes.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.145
He can either accept or deny

00:01:34.145 --> 00:01:38.700
or ask you to work on
bunch of comments, etc.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.690
Let's now go to
cinders dashboard.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.945
Reload the main repository.

00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:58.489
Here is going to see
the pull request.

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:03.860
Let's click on it. We've already

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.200
talked about a variety of
things we can do here.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.820
For example, I can just
say rebates and merge.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.295
But before that, since we have
a branch prediction rule,

00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:21.185
to do at least one review,

00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:23.660
let us quickly review

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.455
the changes and say that I'm
happy with all the changes.

00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:37.710
I'm going to approve
and submit the review.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.615
Now I can actually go ahead

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:46.910
and choose any of these options.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.519
Maybe I'd like to go with merge.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.975
Confirm merge.

00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:58.940
And now all of this feature

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.300
related changes are merged
into the main branch.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.435
So you see all those files here,

00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:10.760
one dot TXT and two dot TXT.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.580
And we're inside
the main branch.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.350
Throughout this entire process,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.990
Luke was never added
as collaborator in

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.885
the original depository or
the upstream repository.

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:23.975
Yet he was able to
contribute to this project.

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:25.370
I hope it makes sense.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.180
I'll see you next.
