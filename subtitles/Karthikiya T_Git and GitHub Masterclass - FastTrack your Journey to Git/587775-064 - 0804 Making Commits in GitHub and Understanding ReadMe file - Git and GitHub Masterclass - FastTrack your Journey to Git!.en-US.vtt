00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.945
Let's see how we can make
our first commit and get up.

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:07.050
And we're going to do that
in the public repository.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.580
What we're going to come at

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.965
is the read me file
for our project.

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:12.990
Now what is the read me file?

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.045
Whatever you want to let know,

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:17.670
the contributors of
your project would go

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.030
inside the read me file
to understand it better,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.220
let's take a look at some of
the existing projects and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.195
GitHub and how depopulated
the ReadMe files.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:28.710
I'm just simply
going to choose one

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.314
of the random projects.

00:00:30.314 --> 00:00:32.250
So I click this link that says

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.440
find reports that
need your help.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.090
I'm just simply going
to choose one of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.700
the random projects
available here.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.360
Maybe this here are the
list of tuples to raise.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.220
Both are public.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.540
Let me choose this one.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.635
All the projects and GitHub

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:02.245
would most likely will
have the read me file.

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:04.525
And it typically goes inside

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:07.150
the root directory
of the project.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.005
So here it is. Let's
see what's inside it.

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:14.875
Basically can write stuff like
your contact information.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:16.300
Some of the links that you want

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.980
to share with the dollar bills.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.885
Or you can instruct
them as to how

00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:21.730
they can raise issues and

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.500
whom to contact to incase

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.100
if there is some issue
with the application.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.500
You can also talk about the
application and its features,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.360
like they're doing here.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.715
Here are the list of features

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:41.400
supported by this application.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.150
They're showing
instructions as to

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.949
how they can download
this project.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.910
And bunch of other information

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.130
that we're sharing
their roadmap so

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.335
that developers will have

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:58.259
the bird's-eye view of
the entire project.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.970
Here they seem to have listed

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.370
all the list of contributors,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.050
or maybe top contributors

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.300
who contributed to this project.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.040
So on and so forth.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.700
Let's go ahead and
create a read me

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.830
file in our public repository.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.180
I'm going to choose the public

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.385
repository that were created.

00:02:19.385 --> 00:02:21.815
And currently we do
not have any commits.

00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:26.345
We can either create a new
file or upload existing file,

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:29.044
or we can choose one
of these options.

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:32.855
And gate will pre-populate
with some content.

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:36.020
We've already seen that
in case of license file,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.185
we already have some
pre-defined templates.

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:41.930
We also have certain
predefined are

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.320
pre-populated templates for
dot ignore file as well.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.790
But we're not going to use that

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.490
because we haven't
yet talked about it.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.770
Let me choose Read Me file.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.585
So it's Read Me dot md file.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:59.029
It's taught MD extension.

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.315
Here. You can write
whatever you want to write.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.755
And once you're done,

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:05.480
you can scroll down and click

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.510
on this button that
says commit new file.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.745
Here you can see that

00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:14.525
some default message is
populated already by GitHub.

00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:17.570
It says Create, Read
Me dot RMD file.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.995
If you wish to change it,

00:03:18.995 --> 00:03:20.135
you can go ahead and change it.

00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:23.960
You can also add the
description about that commit.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.270
But I'm happy with
the default message.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.980
So I'm just simply
going to leave it as

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.245
it is and click on Commit.

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:32.615
No staging step is required.

00:03:32.615 --> 00:03:37.055
This would internally
do that job for us.

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:39.990
Once you commit the file,

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.510
you're going to see
that file here.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.430
Let's make one more commit by

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.950
introducing one another file.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.155
Let me go back and click
this option that says

00:03:54.155 --> 00:03:57.530
Add file, create new file.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.440
Maybe I would like to add
in four dot TXT file,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.155
some content info file.

00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:14.820
Let me expand this.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.170
I'm going to scroll
down. And 1 second.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.095
I'm happy with the
prepopulated text,

00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:26.660
but I can change it to
something else if I wish.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.325
I'm going to leave
this option as it is.

00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:36.460
Since we haven't talked
about pull request.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.260
I cannot explain
you right now as

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.985
to what this option is about.

00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:42.909
We're going to talk about
it in coming lectures.

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.380
Come with the new file.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.355
Now we have a
couple of comments.

00:04:51.355 --> 00:04:53.740
If you click on this commits,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.920
you can see the list of
commits we have done.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.240
Here's the hashCode off each
one of those comments so

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.225
you can copy them by
clicking this icon.

00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:07.430
You can also go to a state of

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.340
a project at a
particular commit.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.950
By clicking this. For example,

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.565
if I click on this, comet
will come at the ReadMe file.

00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:20.105
At this point we don't
have the info file,

00:05:20.105 --> 00:05:22.775
so we don't see it.

00:05:22.775 --> 00:05:28.415
Let me go back. Here. You
get to choose the branch.

00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:30.320
Currently we just
have one branch and

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.900
that is the default main branch.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.320
Otherwise you'd be seeing
list of branches and

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.665
we'd be able to switch
to one of the branches.

00:05:39.665 --> 00:05:42.620
So that's how you make
comments and GitHub.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.010
We created the repository
and also have added some of

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.990
the basic files which makes

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.810
it ready for others to
contribute to our project.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.490
I'll see you next.
