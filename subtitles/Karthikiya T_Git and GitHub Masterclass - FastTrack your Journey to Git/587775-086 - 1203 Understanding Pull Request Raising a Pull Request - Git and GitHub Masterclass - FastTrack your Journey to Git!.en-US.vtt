00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so far we have
created local feature

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.655
one branch and then made
bunch of commits in it.

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:07.020
And we've even pushed

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.330
all those changes to
the remote repository.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.460
And here are all
those changes in

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.350
the remote repository
from GitHub account.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.230
Of course, since this
is a public repository,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.855
anybody would be able to
see all these changes.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.760
Now, loop cannot just try to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.430
emerge all these changes
onto the main branch.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.935
There are certain
practices to be followed.

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.650
And those practices
are in place to make

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.320
sure what gets into the
mainstream of evolution,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.315
which is the main
branch, is clean code.

00:00:37.315 --> 00:00:39.920
So what we need to do
next before we actually

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.175
merge this feature one
changes into the main branch,

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:45.905
is actually to raise
a pull request.

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:47.525
Now what is a pull request?

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:51.125
You can think of pull
request as a review request.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.180
Essentially you're
asking somebody,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.440
in other words, somebody in

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.435
your team, other collaborators,

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:59.450
or the repository
owner to review

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.165
all your changes before
they can be merged

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:05.945
into the mainstream of
evolution, the main branch.

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:07.820
And you might be
wondering why this

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.905
called a pull request.

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:13.970
That word might make sense as
we progress in this course.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.785
But for now you
can think of it as

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:17.570
you are making a request to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.620
pull all your feature one
changes into the main branch.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.110
So let's see how we can
raise a pull request.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.020
I'm currently inside the
Luke's GitHub account.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.515
I want to go to this
section, pull requests.

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:33.215
Currently we do not
have any product quiz.

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:36.080
Let's create one by
clicking on this button.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.405
New pull request.

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:40.430
Here we're going to populate

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.265
all the changes that we've
done in feature one branch.

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:46.114
How are we going to do
that is by comparing

00:01:46.114 --> 00:01:49.115
our feature one branch with
one of the other branches.

00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:50.450
In this case, we're
going to compare

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.535
feature one branch
with the main branch.

00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:54.860
So the difference
between the two are

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.100
the changes that we've
introduced in feature on branch.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.000
Here I'm choosing main branch
as one of the branches.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.950
And the other branch would
be feature one branch.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.915
So you're going to say list of

00:02:08.915 --> 00:02:10.340
changes introduced and feature

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.840
one branch because these are

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.735
the changes that were not
present in main branch.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.820
And if you had multiple files

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.085
involved in all these changes,

00:02:19.085 --> 00:02:22.400
then you'd be seeing all
those changes here as well.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.955
But since all our genius
went inside one single file,

00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:27.875
That's what you're seeing here.

00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:31.100
And it says showing
one changed file.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.940
But anyway, here are all
the list of commits,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.810
all the files that were actually

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.479
modified with all
these comments.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.389
Let's go ahead and
create pull request.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.170
We can write a quick summary of

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.880
what this pull
request is all about.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.705
Introducing feature one,
something of that sort.

00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:02.945
If you want, you can
also leave a comment.

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:06.840
And let's click on
create pull request.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.830
Now we're actually
getting this option that

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.425
says merge pull requests.

00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:21.350
And if I click on one
of these options,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.200
this is actually going
to result in merging

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.500
all the feature one changes
into the main branch.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.139
However, this is not
a good practice.

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.810
Ideally, we want somebody
to review or changes

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.350
before we merge them into
the mainstream of evolution.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.225
At this point in time,

00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:41.945
Luke is able to actually
merge all these changes.

00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:43.655
There's a way to restrict this

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:46.560
and we're going to
talk about it next.
