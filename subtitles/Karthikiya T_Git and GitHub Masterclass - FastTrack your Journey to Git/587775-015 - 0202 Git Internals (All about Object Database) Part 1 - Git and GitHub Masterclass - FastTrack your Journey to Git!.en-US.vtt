00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In order to better explain
how good managers and

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.625
stores the data inside
the object database.

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:08.385
I have deleted everything
inside our project.

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:11.369
So all our commit past history,

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.260
all the changes
we've had introduced

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.995
are now gone for good.

00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:19.175
What we have here is essentially
a brand new directory.

00:00:19.175 --> 00:00:22.070
And I'm now going
to launch Git Bash

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.105
here and create a bunch
of files and directories.

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:28.865
I want to create a couple
of files in this folder.

00:00:28.865 --> 00:00:31.550
So I'm going to use
the command touch one

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.910
dot dx dy and dx dy.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.475
This has created a
couple of files.

00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:39.695
In addition to this, I'm
also going to introduce

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:42.410
a sub directory
inside our project.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.679
It gives the command to
create a brand new directory.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.654
It's MKDIR stands
for make directory.

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:52.835
I'm going to name it as assets.

00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:55.625
So we have assets
that are recreated.

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:58.130
Let's go inside it and create

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.950
bunch of files in there as well.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.680
I'm going to create,
I want to use

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.844
the command touch
one subdata dxdy,

00:01:06.844 --> 00:01:08.989
substance or sub directory,

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:11.090
just for our understanding.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.025
And two sub dot TXT file.

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:21.080
Let's also put some
content in this file.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.825
Let's go back to the
parent directory,

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:26.704
which is our project
root directory.

00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:31.179
I'm going to use
the command echo.

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.865
Next-gen file one.

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:39.620
We're going to populate it
inside one dot TXT file.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.000
And similarly, we're going
to populate some text inside

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.930
the other file, stool, dxdy.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.310
One sub, this is going to go
inside one sub dot dx dy,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.580
which is inside the
assets sub-directory.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.555
So here is our
directory structure.

00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:29.660
We have assets
directory and couple of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.094
files inside the root
project directory.

00:02:33.094 --> 00:02:34.550
And inside assets that are true.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.174
We have these two files.

00:02:37.174 --> 00:02:40.175
Currently this folder
is not get initialized.

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:42.125
So let's do just that.

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:46.235
Get in it to get
initialize this project.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:50.910
And git add all the files.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.650
Git status to see the status.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.130
And as you can see,
everything is staged.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.110
Now let's commit the changes.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.470
Git commit. M.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.030
My first comment.
This should work.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.590
In the next lecture,
we're going to

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.260
understand the different
object types we have in

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.360
Git and how all these files are

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.450
stored inside the
get object database.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.890
I'll see you in the next one.
