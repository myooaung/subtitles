00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Okay, now let us
see everything in

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.280
action and I hope
you're ready for this.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.700
Let us first go ahead and
create a new repository.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.365
Let us call it
maybe super audio.

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:21.490
Maybe we're creating an audio
editing tool whatsoever.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.820
And maybe I'd like to add
the read me file as well.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.230
If you wish, you can actually
go to settings and change

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.120
the default branch name of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.380
main to something
else if you wish.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.610
Maybe we can change
this to master.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.995
It's not mandatory.

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:45.965
But I'm doing it anyway.

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:49.590
I'm going to create
the repository.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.375
As you can see, we have
the master branch.

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:56.405
And this is going to be
the production wrench,

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:57.980
meaning that
whatever goes inside

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.315
the master branch would go
into production enrollment.

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:06.050
Next, let's go ahead and
create the other two branches.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.100
One is going to be the
pre production branch,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.349
and we'll enter
name it as release.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.685
And another branch
is for development.

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:22.440
Let's call it develop.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.630
This branch would be
having the latest of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.340
the latest code from

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.430
all the contributors
are collaborate to us.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.430
Let us now go to
settings and make the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.220
develop branch as
a default branch.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.280
Just so that if somebody
were to clone the project,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.620
they're going to see
the develop branch as

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.800
a default one where
they can contribute.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.170
So we're going to
change this branch from

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.080
master to develop
and click on Update.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.235
Now if I go back,

00:01:55.235 --> 00:01:58.055
you're going to see olive branch

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:00.050
chosen already because
that's going to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.510
be the default branch now.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.480
Now, in order to
simulate the behavior,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.950
to have bunch of features in

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.720
place in the development branch.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.690
I'm simply going to
add a couple of files.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.460
But you need to
make an assumption

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.200
that maybe we have done

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.850
some feature related changes and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.205
contributed to this branch.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:22.700
It might be the case that
somebody else for the project

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.899
and raise pull requests on
this particular branch.

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.405
So whoever folks this project,

00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:30.935
it is expected,

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:33.770
the race pull requests
on the dollar branch.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.235
They do not have any kind
of permission or we do not

00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:38.960
expect anybody to make

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.285
contributions to
the release branch,

00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:44.045
hard the main branch
or the master branch.

00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:47.345
So let us go ahead and
create a couple of files.

00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:53.225
Create a new file, Let's
call it feature one dot TXT.

00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:56.130
Just to keep things simple,

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.785
we're going to create
yet another file.

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:11.630
Create a new file feature
to dot TXT for instance,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.920
and commit the code.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.605
So we have bunch
of commits here.

00:03:17.605 --> 00:03:19.990
The first one was
the read me file,

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.620
and the other two are
for the features.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.255
Now what's the next thing to do?

00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:26.755
Can you make a guess?

00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:29.770
Assuming that we
wanted to release

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.630
our software or the
first version of

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.759
our software to the end-user.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.965
Well, we're going to first
create yet another branch.

00:03:38.965 --> 00:03:41.065
And we're going to
name that branch

00:03:41.065 --> 00:03:43.090
with semantic versioning.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.950
Since this is a
very false version

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.735
of the software we're launching,

00:03:46.735 --> 00:03:52.090
we're going to name it
as we one dot o dot o.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.280
So we're going to
create this branch

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.055
out of the develop branch.

00:03:56.055 --> 00:03:58.250
Meanwhile, other
developers can continue

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.295
contributing to
the dollar branch.

00:04:01.295 --> 00:04:06.605
But what we're going to do
next is we need to merge

00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:08.600
all these changes to

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.315
the release branch from

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:14.165
this particular branch
that we've just created.

00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:16.895
So guess what we
need to do next.

00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:19.175
Way to raise pull requests.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:22.430
Currently, the
release branch does

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.735
not have this feature lead to

00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:26.730
changes when to get them here.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.015
I'm going to go
to pull requests,

00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:37.740
create a new pull request.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.325
Here I'm going to choose

00:04:40.325 --> 00:04:43.010
the release branch and
I want to compare it

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.100
with the version
branch, Let's call it.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.710
So here are all the
features lead to changes.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.860
And I'm going to create
the pull request.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.890
Assuming we've done all
the formalities of review,

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.630
board scanning and all,

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.280
let us go ahead and
merge all these changes.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.020
We don't want to delete
this branch just yet

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.290
because it's going to come
in handy at later stage.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.950
So if you go back to

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.735
the repository and go
to the release branch,

00:05:32.735 --> 00:05:36.230
you would now have all those
features related changes.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.605
So we might be running
some automated tests and

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:43.190
assuming that everything
is working as expected,

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.000
we now have decided to push
all this changes our module,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.210
these changes onto
the master branch

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.170
so that our customers will
start using our software.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:01.320
So once again, we're going to
raise another Pull Request.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.040
New pull request.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.425
Here I'm going to choose
the master branch.

00:06:09.425 --> 00:06:13.950
And here I'm going to
choose the release branch.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.040
And we're going to go ahead
and create the pull request.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.055
Let us also merge all those
changes to the master branch.

00:06:31.055 --> 00:06:33.560
Maybe with three bits and merge.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.670
We can also Squash

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.540
commit to combine all the
commits into a single commit.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.710
But I think we're
good with this.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.660
So we now have
officially released

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.375
our software to the end-user.

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:52.160
So if I click on Master,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.925
you're going to see the
feature lead to changes here.

00:06:55.925 --> 00:06:59.960
Ideally, we supposed to
create a tag right here.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.510
But we're going to
talk about tags in

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.120
upcoming lectures.
I'll see you next.
