00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Okay, let us see how we can
create a GitHub account

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.370
and even create couple
of repositories.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.840
For this purpose, I've actually

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.970
created a fake Gmail account,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.375
which is under Corp
96 at gmail.com.

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:16.995
As if this company is
established in 1996 or WhatsApp.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:19.155
Now cylinder as a freelancer,

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:21.435
he's going to create
a GitHub account

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:23.925
for his own organization so that

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:26.190
everybody else and his
team can now start

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.830
contributing to the
project in GitHub.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.480
Let's click on sign up.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.090
Actually, the instructions
are pretty straightforward.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.250
I don't really have to
walk you through this,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.410
but I'm just doing
this as a formality.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.020
So it is asking us to
enter the email address.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.395
I'm going to do
just that password.

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:56.570
I already have it handy.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.015
So I'm just going to paste it.

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:05.130
Username is going to
be some there Corp 96.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.424
And get up says that
this is not available.

00:01:12.424 --> 00:01:15.170
So we need to change
this to something else,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.660
maybe 1996, now it's
available. Let's continue.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.210
It is asking us if we
would like to receive

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.030
the updates and
announcements via e-mail,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.535
I would say no for now.

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:31.805
If you wish, you can
opt in for that.

00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:33.650
Next. It is asking us to solve

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.290
a puzzle to make sure
that we're not a bot.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.385
I just have to choose
this spiral galaxy.

00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:41.585
In my case.

00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:44.010
I'm going to do just that.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.910
I've done an
excellent job there,

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.670
so I can go ahead and
create the account.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.180
We received this
email with the code,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.810
which I just have to
copy and paste it here.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.245
And we're done with
creating GitHub account.

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:06.860
Pretty much. I just
wanted to skip this step.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.170
If you wish, you can choose
how many team members you

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.050
have and whether you're
a student or a teacher.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.670
But I'm just simply
going to skip it for

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.770
now. And we're done.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.760
Now at the very first glance off

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.440
this welcome page that you see

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.600
once after you login
for the first time,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.280
get up is already giving us

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.385
suggestions as to
what we can do next.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:35.375
We can create repository or
import existing repository.

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:39.005
We can introduce a read
me file in our project.

00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:41.630
We can even explore the options

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.075
to contribute some of
the existing projects,

00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:46.955
which we'll talk about at
later stage in the course.

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:50.210
And there are bunch of
other things which you can

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.710
just take a look at and get

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.350
a sense of what they're about.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.050
You don't have to
go too much deep

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.790
because we're going
to explore everything

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.170
in upcoming lectures.
