00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Okay, let us see how we can
create a new branch and

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.420
even make comments
in it inside GitHub.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.135
For that, let me go to
one of the repositories.

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:12.705
I'm going to be using the
public repository for this.

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:16.395
Here you get to see
a list of branches.

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:18.750
Currently we just
have one branch,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.395
the main branch, which is
also the default branch.

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:26.865
Here you can see this link
that says view all branches.

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:29.490
You can either click
here or you can also

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.520
click this link that
says one branch.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.585
It says one branch because we
currently have one branch.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:39.015
Let's click on this link.

00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:42.160
Here you see the option
to create a new branch.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.955
Just click on this button,

00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:46.040
type in the name that
you'd like to do to

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.140
that branch.
Something like that.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.375
You can also choose
the source branch

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:55.865
from where you want to
create this branch.

00:00:55.865 --> 00:00:58.730
In this case, we
just have one branch

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.390
and it has defaulted
to the main branch.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.919
I'm going to keep it as it is
and click on Create Branch.

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:10.535
This has created
the branch for us.

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:13.040
You can also see specific
list of branches.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.830
For example, if I
click on activate,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.525
this is going to list on

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:19.580
all the list of
Act two branches.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.825
Or in other words,

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:23.000
these are the branches
where there is

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.810
at least one commit made
in past three months.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.615
You're not going to see
the default branch though.

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:33.000
You can see the branch
that will just created.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.960
This tail branches is the
opposite of two branches.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.360
If there are any branches
where you haven't made

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.625
any commits in
past three months,

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:46.010
you're going to be seeing
a list of them here.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.290
If you're the owner
of the repository,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.955
maybe you'd like to
get in touch with

00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:52.850
collaborators are
developers who are working

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.980
on these branches and check with

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.980
them if they still want to
keep these branches or not.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.510
You'll get better idea about

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.105
it as we progress
in this course.

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:05.210
And the branches in this
section would be listed in

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.920
a manner that the branch with

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.085
the oldest commit
would be listed first.

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:13.085
Whereas here in the
active section,

00:02:13.085 --> 00:02:16.070
all those branches would
be listed in a manner that

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.975
the branches with
the recent commit

00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:20.135
would be listed first.

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:22.670
If you click on all branches,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.910
this foot just show
the default branch,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.820
followed by all the other
branches ordered by

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.315
the branches with the
most recent commit first.

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:39.065
You can also delete a branch
and you can restore it.

00:02:39.065 --> 00:02:40.820
If you delete a branch,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.870
refresh the page, then it's
too late to restore it.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.705
So we're able to
create a new branch.

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:51.030
Let us go back to
the repository.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.560
Here we get to choose

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.635
the branch that we
wanted to switch to.

00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:06.110
Switch to feature branch.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.900
This is as if we have run
this which command or

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.080
checkout command mentioning
the branch name.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.700
And if you notice, we now have
two branches showing here.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.180
We can either add a new file in

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.095
this branch or edit one
of the existing files.

00:03:24.095 --> 00:03:28.110
Let's try to add it.
Read Me dot MD file.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.680
I click on this icon,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.960
which will allow me

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:42.335
to edit some message.

00:03:42.335 --> 00:03:44.225
I want to scroll down.

00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:46.970
I'm happy with the default
message if you wish,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.725
you can go ahead and change it.

00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:52.160
I'm going to leave
this option as is.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.590
And click on Commit Changes.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.790
This has committed how
changes in the new branch.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.435
We're currently in main branch.

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:10.115
And if you click on Read Me dot

00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:13.625
md file and check its content,

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:15.620
you would notice that it
doesn't have the changes

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.380
introduced in new
feature branch.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.290
But if you switch
to feature branch,

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.955
as you can expect,

00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:25.010
you're going to see
the changes that

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.169
we've just introduced
and feature branch.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.600
I'll see you next.
