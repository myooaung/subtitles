00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.640
Okay, Let us assume that Luke is

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.950
done with all the
feature ten changes.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.240
And now he's willing to

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.595
propose all these
changes to sender,

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:10.800
who's the owner of the
original depository

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.155
or the upstream repository.

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:16.110
But before Luke even
consider doing that,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.630
he need to make sure that
it has got all the updates,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.440
all the latest updates from
the upstream repository,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.170
and makes sure his forked
repository as well

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.135
as the local depository,
are up-to-date with it.

00:00:28.135 --> 00:00:29.840
We've already seen how it can be

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.645
done in last couple of lectures.

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:34.400
The second thing
that loop needs to

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.170
make sure is to actually

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.785
read this as feature branch
on top of the main branch.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:41.705
So let's do that real quick.

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:45.440
I'm going to switch to
feature ten branch.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.215
I'm going to right-click
on the latest commit

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:50.855
off the main branch.

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:53.330
And then I'm going to
choose this option that

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.240
says rebased current
branch on this.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.695
With this, we get rid off

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:06.155
any possible conflicts
that might occur.

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:08.479
If you come across with
any kind of conflicts,

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.730
you already knew how
to deal with that.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.219
Once you're done with that,

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:17.630
you're actually going to
push all these changes to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.230
the remote repository or

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.300
to the forked repository
or the origin.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.580
So let's push all this changes.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.750
We get a prompt that
says the branch feature

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.065
Dan has no remote branch.

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:35.210
Would you like to
publish this branch?

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.775
I say, okay, I want to
choose the origin acid mode.

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:44.720
That's what I want to
publish or push our changes

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.749
to. It is successful.

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.745
That has go to Luke's account

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:55.324
and see if things got reflected.

00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:57.410
And sure enough, you're now

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.979
seeing let me reload the page.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.309
You're now seeing
this new branch.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.090
Next we're going to see
how we can raise pull

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.720
request to propose our
changes to master cylinder.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.070
I'll see you next.
