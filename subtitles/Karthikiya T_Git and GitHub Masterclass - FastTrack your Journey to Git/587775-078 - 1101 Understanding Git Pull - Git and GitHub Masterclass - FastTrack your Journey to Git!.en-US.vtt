00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Let us talk about git pull.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.425
Now say it with me.

00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:06.045
Git pull is equal to

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:09.255
git-fetch plus git merge

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:11.850
or rebased depending on
the option that we choose.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.980
That's essentially
what is good Pull.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.280
Perhaps this is the shortest
video of the entire course.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.115
However, it may not be
so straightforward.

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:21.660
We're going to talk
about good pull in

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.730
more detail in
upcoming lectures.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.600
I'll see you next.
