00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.365
Alright, it is now time
to talk about GitHub.

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:06.585
We sort of already touched on

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:08.295
this at the beginning
of the course.

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:10.860
But let us try to reiterate
and try to understand

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.060
the need to have

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.060
a centralized code hosting
service like GitHub.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.015
If you're the only one who
is working on the project,

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:20.400
then you do not need
something like GitHub.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.800
You can just get away with
Git that is installed

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.800
locally to manage the
versions of your project.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.190
However, as your project
grows bigger in size,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.720
you might want to hire

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.975
additional people who can
contribute to your project.

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:36.115
Though just one or two people,

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:37.790
then you can easily manage

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.425
without having to use
a service like GitHub.

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:42.890
Tens and hundreds of employees

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.290
who might want to
contribute to your project,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.480
then you surely need a
better way to manage

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.790
your code and it's
version history.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.255
And that's where GitHub
would come into picture.

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:56.405
And GitHub acts like a
centralized code repository

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:58.820
where everybody would
contribute their code.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.400
Essentially, they make
bunch of commits in

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.980
their local Git and then upload

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.830
or push all those changes to
the centralized repository.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.185
And then everybody else
would be able to download

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:12.605
all the changes introduced
by other team members.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.500
Say everybody would
essentially have a copy of

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.365
the entire project on
the local computer.

00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:21.590
As well as we also have
a copy of the project in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.060
the centralized repository like

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.550
GitHub along with
its version history.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.710
And that's what I
get is called a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.380
distributed version
control system.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.470
However, get is not just
about being able to

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.410
host your code or
maintain version history.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.630
It offers a lot
of other features

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.180
which are pretty useful
for an organization.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.130
For example, being
able to manage

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.455
team members as to
who can do what.

00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:48.710
Are being able to review the
changes introduced by one of

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.240
the team members before merging

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.615
them into the mainstream
of development.

00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:54.590
You can do pretty much
everything what you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.630
can do in your local
good software,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.460
like committing the code,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.515
creating branches, et cetera.

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:03.335
It will also offer you to
comment on somebody's work.

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:07.565
We can also discuss things
over community, etc.

00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:10.625
Now GitHub is not the
only option for us.

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:12.410
We've got other
players as well in

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.785
the market which saw
the exact same purpose.

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:17.750
Which one you want to use is

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.585
entirely dependent on
your requirements.

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:22.250
If your organization is using

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.800
Atlassian ecosystem
projects like Jira, bamboo,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.980
et cetera, then Bitbucket
might make sense to

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.670
you because it has better
integration with those tools.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.560
And amongst all of these three,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.030
git lab is open source.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.825
The other two have both
free and paid tiers.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.850
And get lab and Bitbucket

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.130
has better support for
continuous integration,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.170
which is a concept of DevOps up

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.705
discussed it in
my DevOps course.

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:50.420
But GitHub is the oldest
among these three.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.310
There are millions of projects

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.395
that rely on GitHub
and there are

00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:56.540
millions and millions
of developers across

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.225
the globe who are
actively using GitHub.

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:01.910
Github has amazing
community and is

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.685
also the best choice for
open-source projects.

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:07.340
User interface is also
quite minimalistic,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.080
but it comes with
a cost, though.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.000
It doesn't have the
integrated support for

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.525
continuous integration like
with GitLab and Bitbucket.

00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:16.070
But it's okay, you
can use some of

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.915
the third-party tools for that.

00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:19.730
But it doesn't
matter which one of

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.860
these tools you will learn.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.975
They ultimately
have the same goal

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:25.850
of managing your project.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.530
They might differ in terms of

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.860
user interface and terminologies
that are being used.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.769
But otherwise, they all
have the same purpose.
