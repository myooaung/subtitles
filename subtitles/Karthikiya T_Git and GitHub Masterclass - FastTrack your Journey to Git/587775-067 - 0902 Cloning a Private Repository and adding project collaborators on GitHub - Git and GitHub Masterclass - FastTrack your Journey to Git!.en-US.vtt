00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
Okay, let's see how we can
clone a private repository.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.790
Currently I've
logged in as sender,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.830
who is the owner of
these repositories?

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.735
One is the public
repository and the other

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:12.075
is the private repository.

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:15.420
We've already seen how we can
clone a public repository.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.045
Anybody in the world
can actually view it,

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:19.695
clone it onto the system.

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:22.005
But when it comes to
private repository,

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.350
not everyone can actually
access it or be able to clone

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.315
it unless sender address them

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:30.180
as collaborator
of their project.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.055
In order to demonstrate this,

00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:36.120
I've actually logged in as
both cylinder as well as Luke,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.830
who'd be contributing to

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.690
the private repository
of cylinder.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.305
In order to distinguish
between these two accounts.

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:47.630
The one with the
black team belongs to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.770
sunder and the one with the
white team belongs to Luke.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.160
Now you need to
make an assumption

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.570
that these two people have

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.780
actually logged in from
their own computers.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.375
And of course not
from the same system,

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.560
like we're doing here.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.375
Let me copy the link of

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.700
the private repository and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.040
tried to access it
from Luke's account.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.050
And we get an error
that says 404.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.615
This is not the webpage
you're looking for.

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.970
That's because under
hasn't given permission

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.070
to look to access this project.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.840
So what sender needs to do

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.789
is you need to go
into that repository,

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:38.135
go to settings, and then
add Luke as contributor.

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:41.820
Let me enter the
password real quick.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.960
You'll see this option
that says Add People.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.580
I'm going to search for.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.800
Looks under carp.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.660
Since Luke has a content,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.795
github, will be able to see him.

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:08.810
Let me choose them and click on

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.620
Add looks on the Corp
to this repository.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.830
Once we do that, loop
will actually receive

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.850
an e-mail to accept

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.100
the sun does invitation to be

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.420
the collaborator of sender's
private repository.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.000
So let me click on this link.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.080
Click on Accepted Mutation.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.220
Now if you go to the
dashboard of Luke,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.055
you can see that private
repository getting populated.

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:51.545
Let me click on it.

00:02:51.545 --> 00:02:55.265
I can now go ahead and
plot this project.

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:57.200
But it's not very
straightforward

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.985
as with public repository,

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:01.460
we have to actually
authenticate it.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.025
Let me demonstrate it for you.

00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:05.810
So this is looks computer.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.815
Let us assume I'm
inside the F drive.

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:13.940
And let's run the
command git clone

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.000
and paste the URL and see
what's going to happen.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.345
Well, good opens up
this particular prompt.

00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:27.260
And there are multiple
ways we can authenticate.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.690
But I'd like to go
with this option that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.645
says sign-in with code.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:35.075
If you choose sign in
with your browser,

00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:37.370
you'd just be taken
to a web page where

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.800
you'd be asked to login
to your GitHub account.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.795
And that way you'll
be authenticated

00:03:41.795 --> 00:03:44.105
and cloning process
will continue.

00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:47.820
But let's try to
choose this way.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.010
When I click on Login with code,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.025
you're going to see a code

00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:58.230
that we need to use
to authenticate.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.820
Let me open up a
browser window first.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:14.525
I'm going to go to github.com
slash login slash device.

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:18.150
It will take us to this page.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.825
Let me copy this code,

00:04:20.825 --> 00:04:26.220
control C and control
V. And click Continue.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.700
Click on Authorize.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.855
Does asking us to enter the
password of Luke's account.

00:04:35.855 --> 00:04:38.760
Let's do that real quick.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:48.455
That's all. Our cloning
process has continued.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:53.130
And we can now start
accessing the bank app.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:04.220
Groups lists with the
hyphenate option,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.319
but also show the
hidden folders.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.730
From this point on,
everything would remain as

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.235
is as with the
public repository.

00:05:13.235 --> 00:05:14.630
But that's how you clone

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.720
a private repository.
I'll see you next.
