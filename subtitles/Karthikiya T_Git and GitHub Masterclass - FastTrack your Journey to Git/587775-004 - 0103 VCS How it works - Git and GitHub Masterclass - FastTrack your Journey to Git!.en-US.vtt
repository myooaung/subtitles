00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.789
Let us see how the
Version Control System,

00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:06.450
or simply visio software
works at a very high level.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.940
Once again, assume
that we have sunder,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.710
who is a freelance developer,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.920
and cylinder has got
a new client, Linda,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.570
who is a restaurant owner,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.080
and she wanted to have a
website for her restaurant.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.470
So to accept online orders
from our customers.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.660
You can tell based
on their smile

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.850
that he's ready to
take up the project.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.580
But based on his
past bad experiences

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.620
with some of his
other clients who

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.570
now have decided to use

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.665
a VCS software to
manage versioning.

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:39.080
Cylinder in his local computer,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.750
creates a folder with
the name restaurant app,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.210
spends a few days and
introduce all the files

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.315
required to create a minimum
functioning website.

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:49.070
The video software will have

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.840
its own data store to store

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.300
all the historical
data and backups.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.850
When I say Datastore doesn't
necessarily have to be

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.375
a relational database or some
form of database software.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:01.880
It can be as simple
as filesystem.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.310
We sell software is
typically tend to use

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.290
your own file system to store

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.720
the backups and historical data.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.310
As we progress
through the course,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.715
you will understand this
concept much better.

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:16.670
But for now, just assume
that this is some kind of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.590
a backup store to store
the state of the project.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.170
Now assume that cylinder
is quite happy with

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.750
the progress he has
made in his project.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.480
He has got a minimum
functioning website

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.800
and has tested everything.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.090
Everything is working great.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.440
So it has decided to save

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.344
the state of this
current project.

00:01:35.344 --> 00:01:38.375
So to retrieve it
back when needed.

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:41.270
So he's going to instruct
the visio software

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.715
to store the current
state of the project,

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:45.995
typically by running a command.

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:47.750
Once it runs the
command that we see

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.910
software would
essentially make a copy

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.650
of all the files and store
them inside the data store.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.600
Now assume that sender has got

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.670
a new requirement to
introduce feature one.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.020
And assume that all
those code changes

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.565
would need to go inside file,

00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:07.585
bn file, see some that has
made all those changes.

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.220
Once again, is going to run

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.180
the command to save the
state of his current work.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.830
But this time the vizier soft,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.390
we'll store the
information slightly

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.839
different compared to
how it's stored earlier.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.045
This is how it's going to store.

00:02:22.045 --> 00:02:25.315
Since no changes were
introduced in file a,

00:02:25.315 --> 00:02:27.310
the VCU software would only

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.205
store the reference of defile a.

00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:32.830
What that means is it will
just have information

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.059
about the location where they
file a copy is residing.

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:39.250
And the reason for
this is obvious.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.900
We don't want to
unnecessarily make

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.130
a copy of all the files that

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.525
were untouched or unmodified
and take up this space.

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:49.970
When it comes to file B and C,

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.715
though, we have
introduced new changes.

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:55.070
But the easiest
software is not going

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.980
to make a copy of
these files. Adr.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.340
What is going to store is
actually the difference

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.145
between the modified file

00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:06.425
and the latest version
of the same file.

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:09.710
And it's going to store
the same in the Datastore.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.310
We call each one of
these has a bad set.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.520
Essentially, a bad set is
the difference between

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.290
the original file and

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.375
the latest version
of the same file.

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:23.255
And the reason for that
is once again obvious.

00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:26.345
We want to save this space
as much as possible.

00:03:26.345 --> 00:03:28.790
Similarly, assume that
we have new feature

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.265
called feature to
which is introduced.

00:03:31.265 --> 00:03:34.310
And file a and file
B were modified.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.464
And this is how the VCS
software would store the data.

00:03:38.464 --> 00:03:41.675
So we have PAD sets
for file a and file B.

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:44.420
And then for file C,
we're only going to store

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.390
the reference of its
previous version.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.244
And similarly assume that
we have another feature.

00:03:51.244 --> 00:03:53.870
We are going to make
modifications to file B.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.075
And this is how
the VCO software,

00:03:56.075 --> 00:03:57.935
which store the information,

00:03:57.935 --> 00:03:59.825
now assumed that cylinder is not

00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:02.030
happy with the version for

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.310
raw file B and that he wanted to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.370
get back to version
three of file B.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.640
So it's going to insert the
same to the vizier software.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.940
The visa softer would then
pick up the original copy of

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.390
file B and then apply
all the patches that

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.570
came after it till
version three to make up

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.550
the version three file B

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.515
and is going to give
back to Sunday.

00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:26.915
He can do whatever he
wants to do with it.

00:04:26.915 --> 00:04:30.590
Similar listener can also
write the command instructing

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.220
the software to get the
entire project torsion three,

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.015
for instance, and the software
is going to do just that.

00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:39.770
Now, obviously
there are a lot of

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.125
vizier softwares
available in the market.

00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:45.920
We have good Mercurial,
SVN, et cetera.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.260
And they all differ
slightly in terms

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.690
of how the managed
historical data.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.485
But in general, this is how
the manage historical data.

00:04:54.485 --> 00:04:57.290
Now let's dive deep and
understanding what exactly

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.265
happens, what happened, why?

00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:03.815
I don't care how it
works internally.

00:05:03.815 --> 00:05:06.140
It doesn't help me
with my job anyway.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.440
I just want to know how
to use the software.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.660
That makes sense.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.235
That makes sense.

00:05:13.235 --> 00:05:16.580
Just one last video and
then we'll start installing

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.119
the gate and get our hands
dirty with lots of practice.

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:22.070
How about that?

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.275
Thanks.

00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:26.760
You're welcome.
