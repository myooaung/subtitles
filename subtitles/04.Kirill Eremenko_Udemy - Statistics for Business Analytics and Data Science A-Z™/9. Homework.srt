1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,310
Our homework time.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:09,830
I know we have a few traitors among our students and you guys are going to love this today we're going

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:17,180
to Wall Street New York you're going to be working as a quant which is sort of a quantitative analyst

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,270
at one of the investment funds.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,320
Very interesting challenge ahead.

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:28,550
But before we proceed I have to read out a disclaimer because there is like a hint that as if we are

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,340
working on a financial market even all the all of this is made up just to make sure that everybody is

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:34,970
safe.

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,280
I just want to make sure that don't go running and applying this in finances and investments this is

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,050
just for educational purposes so here we go.

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,350
Any information in this tutorial is for educational purposes only and does not constitute personal or

12
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,640
investment advice.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,550
We will not accept liability for any loss or damage including without limitation to any loss of profit

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,970
which may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on such information.

15
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,350
You should seek independent financial advice prior to acquiring a financial product.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,660
All securities and financial products or instruments transactions involve risks.

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,520
Please remember that past performance results are not necessarily indicative of future results and with

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,600
that in mind we can proceed with the tutorial.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,300
OK so the challenge you are a quant or quantitative analyst working for a Wall Street investment fund

20
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,890
the team of traders under your supervision pre-high position.

21
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,860
If you are a team of traders under supervision earns profits which can be approximated zoophile law

22
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:45,560
plus distribution profits have a means of $95 and 70 cents and a whopping standard deviation of 1247

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,330
dollars.

24
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,970
Your team makes about 100 trades every week.

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,200
Questions.

26
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:50,880
Question 8.

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,650
What is the possibility of your team making a loss.

28
00:01:53,660 --> 00:02:01,310
In any given week question be what is the probability of your team making over $20000 profit in any

29
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,150
given week.

30
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,500
An example of a law plus distribution can be found on the following page.

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,790
This is what a description looks like and that's it.

32
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,860
Off we go.

33
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,880
The challenge is set going to reveal some hints or one hint just now.

34
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:23,250
But if you think you're ready if you're prepared to take on this challenge then feel free to proceed.

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,510
And then compare to the solution which you can find at the end of the course.

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,900
All right.

37
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,740
Good luck with that.

38
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:36,740
And now we're going to move onto the hint so we only have one hint today and it's very trivial because

39
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,130
we know everything we need to know apart from this one thing even this one thing we do know as well.

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,280
Does it matter what distribution the profits follow.

41
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,820
Question mark answer.

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,590
No it doesn't.

43
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,050
They'll applause distribution is there just to scare you.

44
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,520
It doesn't matter.

45
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,310
We know the central in that theory.

46
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,780
So we don't really care what distribution the profits follow we can just apply the central limit here

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,810
and there we go.

48
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,520
That was the only hint and I'm sure you knew that already.

49
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,100
So good luck with the challenge and I'll see you in the solution.

50
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,060
And until then happy analyzing.
