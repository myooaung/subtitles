00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.690
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics.

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.790
And today we're talking about the central limit theorem intuition.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.330
So we've already discussed what the central limit theorem is all about.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.790
That's whatever distribution you have in your population the sampling distribution of your sample means

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.370
will be normal.

6
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.410
All be close and Roble given that you take a lot of samples the more Savile's you have and the larger

7
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.940
those samples the closer will be to normal distribution.

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.050
But the point still stands that you will have a normal distribution regardless of what the underlying

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.090
distribution of population is.

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.360
So let's have a look at how exactly this can come to be let's have a look at the intuitive side of things.

11
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.120
So let's start with our distribution very unknown very strange looking distribution here and we'll just

12
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.880
point out where the mean of the situation is and by looking at the picture we can assess that it's somewhere

13
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.230
over there probably.

14
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.470
Next we're going to take a sample from here and we're going to take a sample of 10 random elements from

15
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.510
this distribution and that's what it might look like because it's random and it could look anything

16
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.940
like anything that would come from the distribution and therefore that's one of the examples.

17
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.520
Now let's take another sample and this is what this sample often elements might look like a second other

18
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.660
sample.

19
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.220
This one might look like that.

20
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.030
And this is another one called that.

21
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.620
And let's have a look at another one that we got.

22
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.920
So we've taken five so far of course we need to take way more than that.

23
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.470
We take lots and lots of samples and more the better.

24
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.800
And then what happens is we find them mean.

25
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.830
So we're going through the process of creating the sampling distribution we've talked about in a couple

26
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.510
of times but now we're actually going through the process of creating a sampling description so to create

27
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.710
a sampling distribution.

28
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.190
We need to find the sample means or the mean of every single sample.

29
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.290
So there's all mean of the first sample.

30
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.650
There's I mean the second sample somewhere there there's no third samples.

31
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.820
There's more to the left because you can see there's more elements that came from the left side of the

32
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.860
original distribution.

33
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.870
There's our sample mean for the fourth sample.

34
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.940
And there's Amin for the fifth sample is very far on the right because we don't have anything on the

35
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.460
left and so on so we do that for the rest of them that we've picked out and what we want to do next

36
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.970
is we want to finally plot this sampling distribution of the sampling of the sample mean.

37
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.470
Next what we want to do is take all of these sample means that we've found and project them onto our

38
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.480
new chart and that's what it looked like.

39
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.340
So here we only have five so far.

40
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.500
And of course we'll have way more because of all of those other steps that we're going to take in here.

41
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.990
All of those other samples that we're going to look at but even just five already starts to paint the

42
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.330
picture you can see that this is kind of the intuition behind things so we're going to be understanding

43
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.940
why is it going to be a normal distribution.

44
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.330
So what we expect is a normal distribution.

45
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.860
And there's going to be a couple of other things I will notice just now.

46
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.700
So first of all why would it be a normal distribution.

47
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.970
Well you can see that sometimes you kind of like gets a sample from far away from here from the left

48
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.920
sometimes you get a sample from the right.

49
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.370
But generally speaking because you're sampling randomly from this distribution it's kind of weighing

50
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.450
towards the center.

51
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.540
So even though there's like it's a buy buy model distribution you got left and the right arm they kind

52
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.540
of balance each other out.

53
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.920
So sometimes you get some values from here which will be balance Ahlberg.

54
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.330
So you get these values which are balanced by our bodies.

55
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.030
So this X is still close to the center these values about our bodies Raje this extra cost center then

56
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.970
this time these values in really bad.

57
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.920
This one out you've got an x that is not exactly the center.

58
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.610
It's going to be towards the tail of the distribution.

59
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.470
Then again you've got an x that is balanced and then you go to X that is not balanced out and the natural

60
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.130
question becomes and here is what if you only had one hand you had the hump here.

61
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.480
What if you didn't have this then this X wouldn't be here in the first place this X is always going

62
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.850
to be in the middle that's where it's going to be at the mean.

63
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.780
So that's why it would have been here.

64
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.460
And then the whole thing would be would happen is exactly the same way but around a different mean and

65
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.090
that's the kind of like the the magic to it that this the positioning of this X is the mean and therefore

66
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.070
it's kind of like in-between in the very center of this distribution regardless of what it looks like.

67
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.420
And therefore when you're sampling your new means are always going to be somewhere on the center.

68
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.070
And moreover the model you'll have more of them as as you're closer to the center as you get for the

69
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.520
way it's going to happen rarer because it's it's more rare event to just get parts of the OR JUST GET

70
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.790
elements from this distribution just from here.

71
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.290
Given that if this is the mean then there's an equal amount.

72
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.880
Pretty much that there's an equal probability of getting some from here as well.

73
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.700
So things like this are going to be quite rare whereas this is going to be more common.

74
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.050
And so once you take more of these samples you will get something that was just a sampling distribution

75
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.100
of the sample mean.

76
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.730
And now the key here is that's where an additional insight which we've already talked through is that

77
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.750
the meaning of this sampling distribution is actually going to match up with this mean.

78
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.060
So they're going to be exactly the same.

79
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:29.730
And that's a very powerful and additional powerful feature of the Central Limit Theorem because by constructing

80
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.670
this sampling distribution now you can just look at the mean of the sampling distribution and you will

81
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.500
know the mean in your underlying population because you don't actually know it from the from the start

82
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.360
you don't know this mean but because you now know this sampling distribution you know it's mean you

83
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.280
will know the mean of the population.

84
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.690
So that's a very powerful thing.

85
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.670
So Or if you knew this for some reason you knew this then you can establish what the meaning of the

86
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.250
sampling distribution is is very powerful that they're linked together.

87
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:07.020
So basically if you put that into a sentence then the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample

88
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.710
mean is equal to the mean of the original distribution of the population.

89
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.060
So as you can see that sentence starting to grow and grow with lots of terms but nevertheless it is

90
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.890
quite an intuitive concept when you think about it the way we thought about it.

91
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.020
So let's write that down sampling distribution.

92
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.260
The myu of X bar equals to me.

93
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.830
So every important thing to note here is that well first of all x bar is.

94
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.340
That's ex-parte every single time and therefore that's the sampling distribution.

95
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.620
But remember at the start we said we will have a different notation for samples for samples which are

96
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.660
going to mean we're going to use X bar so that's the sample.

97
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.310
So the question is why are we using here again for the sampling distribution when are we using X bar

98
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.460
of X bar or a different x bar.

99
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.720
Why is not we are not treating this as sample Why are we treating it as a distribution as a population.

100
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.850
Well that is because this is a different thing.

101
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.230
It's not a sample.

102
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.800
So these are samples but this is not a sample.

103
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.810
It's not necessarily a population.

104
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:12.920
This is the population.

105
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.600
But at the same time this is not a sample and that's why we're going to be using the original characters

106
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.460
or Greek letters.

107
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:24.480
So we're going to be using you for the sample mean for the sampling distribution.

108
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.920
That's number one.

109
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.330
So we already know two things about the central limit.

110
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.670
First of all that this is going to be a normal distribution no matter what.

111
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:41.250
Second is that your mean of your sampling distribution of the sample mean is going to be equal to the

112
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.800
mean of the original population.

113
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:50.400
And the third thing about the central and theorem there has to be three of course is that the standard

114
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:59.310
deviation of your sampling distribution is actually very linked directly linked to your standard deviation

115
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.840
of your original population.

116
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:06.870
So the standard additional sampling distribution is basically your standard deviation of the original

117
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:13.950
population divided by square root of the number of observations that you're taking every time.

118
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:19.230
So here would be a square root of 10 and that's a very important thing as well so what it's basically

119
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:24.230
saying we're not going to prove it here because you would need to go into math for that.

120
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:29.480
But what it's saying is that the more you take every single time.

121
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:36.150
So if I wasn't taking that and if instead of 10 we were taking 100 observations for every sample then

122
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:43.050
your normal distribution here would be much narrower because remember the sanitation is a metric of

123
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:51.930
how a variance of how the values here vary and if your and is greater then this value will be lower.

124
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:57.960
So your standard will be lower and therefore this will be much taller and narrower meaning that your

125
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.030
actual results here.

126
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:08.720
Your sample means will be very close to the mean of this of this tradition.

127
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.510
So that's what this means.

128
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:17.340
And it's kind of it probably intuitive that you know the more you take the more accurate in like floating

129
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.450
quotations the more accurate as every single sample.

130
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.310
So there we go.

131
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:26.640
That's our central limit theorem and three elements three main elements to it.

132
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:32.760
That this is a normal distribution that the mean of your sampling distribution of re-assembling mean

133
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:38.430
is equal to the mean of the population that the standard deviation of your sampling distribution of

134
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:45.410
the sample mean is linked to the standard deviation of the original population in that formula.

135
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.010
So hope you enjoyed this tutorial and hope this is.

136
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:55.710
You can now see the power of the central limit theorem that how much value actually brings through these

137
00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:01.900
three elements how much you'll be able to information you'll be able to extract insights.

138
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.870
And we'll actually see it in practice in the coming to terms and I can wait for you to check that out.

139
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.940
And until next time happy analyzing.
