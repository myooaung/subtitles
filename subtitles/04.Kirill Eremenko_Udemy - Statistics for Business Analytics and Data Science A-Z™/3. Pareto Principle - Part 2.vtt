Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.550
Today we're going to be talking about the in the verse Parader principle.

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.130
This is a specific interpretation of the principle that I would like to share with you.

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.970
It is in fact the way to say no more often.

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.140
And finding the good way to do it.

6
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.320
This proto inverse proto principle is primarily applicable to the finite resources that you that you

7
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.080
have.

8
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.050
And I'll give you a few examples.

9
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.590
The most common example is that this is what I mean by final results.

10
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.020
One example is the effective working time that you have per day as an individual.

11
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.510
You can have it more than 24 hours for sure.

12
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.540
So it is already the definition of being finite.

13
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.890
Another example is your savings available for investments.

14
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.610
It could be your span of attention during the lecture including during this tutorial.

15
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.120
So your resources are usually almost always finite.

16
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.410
Why don't we have finite resources and input them into the system to get some output to the classical

17
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.350
perimeter principle suggests that 80 percent of the output will be associated with 20 percent of the

18
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.850
input of your finite results.

19
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:35.770
But the inverse is probably true as well meaning that 80 percent of your final results will lead only

20
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.380
to 20 percent of the output.

21
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.680
Isn't it amazing and mind blowing.

22
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.400
So what one could do in this situation is actually to identify these resources that were spent only

23
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.280
to get disproportionally small amount of output and eliminated.

24
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.930
Don't put it into the system in this case you are freeing up these finite resources to do something

25
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.590
else to apply in totally different other systems.

26
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:14.320
Or finding a better approach to the same problem that you can leverage and utilize your resources better.

27
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.730
I guess more effectively with a higher percentage of output with a higher ratio based on the principle

28
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:30.320
as one of my favorite writers Tim Ferriss said in one of his blog posts what you don't do determines

29
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.390
what you can do.

30
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.620
And I think that's could be.

31
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.130
This slide can be a good representation of his words.

32
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:47.510
If you eliminate your ineffective unproductive time in one of the systems you can use this time and

33
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.550
redeployed.

34
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.860
I want to bring one more quote in this case.

35
00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.870
It is attributed to Warren Buffett that is related to the inverse period of principle in my view Warren

36
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.920
Buffett said the difference between successful and very successful people is that very successful people

37
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.590
say no to almost everything.

38
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.430
In this case I would probably say almost everything is 80 percent.

39
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.630
And on this note I would like to close it out.

40
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.460
I hope you enjoyed it and see in the next tutorial.
