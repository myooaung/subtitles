00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,530
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:10,400
OK so today we're talking about a Student's t distribution a very interesting topic.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:16,800
It may be a bit scary sometimes when you hear it because there's so many things to keep in mind as the

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,300
Zed's statistics which we very talked about.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,520
There's a central limit theorem.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:28,470
There's the p values the Zed test which is the hypothesis test then the proportions are already so much

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,660
and that's why another type of distribution might be a bit off putting.

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,130
But at the same time it's actually pretty simple.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,900
We've had going into the complex math you will see that it is straightforward what is going on and it's

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,340
very easy to apply in practice.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,110
Given that knowledge we already have.

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,830
So there's that straight into it.

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,460
Here we have a gentleman called William Seeley I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:58,460
Gosset and he was a statistician who worked for the Guinness brewery in Ireland.

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:08,010
And he actually published the t distribution under a pseudonym student and there's lots of speculation

16
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,320
about it.

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,260
Like I read on Expedia that maybe Guinness the Guinness brewery didn't want to know it didn't want their

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,800
competitors to know what they're using their distribution for and what he was using it for was he was

19
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:27,840
interested in analyzing chemical properties of samples sizes very small size as few as three elements

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,260
in a sample.

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:36,300
Can you imagine that like we were working with samples with 150 or 100 or 50 or at least 50 or like

22
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,310
larger samples.

23
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,180
Sometimes you might have a sample of thousands if you're doing a poll or something.

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:49,080
And he was trying to analyze you know make inferences about populations from samples as small as three

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,790
elements.

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,730
And so that's that's where the t distribution is like it has its place it has its little niche in the

27
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,820
world of statistics.

28
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,670
It deals with situations where your sample size is rather small.

29
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,650
So this is what distribution looks like.

30
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,660
Look familiar.

31
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,170
It's very similar to the normal distribution factors just like a modification of the normal distribution.

32
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,410
The formulas there on the right we're not going to go through that.

33
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,960
Is there an extra function and there is a thing we will talk about as the degrees of freedom.

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,600
So the normal this distribution it just has a new parameter that which we're going to have to keep in

35
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,140
mind.

36
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,030
Degrees of freedom and degrees of freedom is very simple.

37
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,110
Here it's thrown out one degree of freedom two degrees five or six infinit degrees of freedom degrees

38
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,500
of freedom is basically the number of the size of your sample minus one.

39
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,650
That's all it is.

40
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,770
So you distribution it has heavier tails is very similar to the normal distribution.

41
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,910
In fact we hear this black one the one where the degrees of freedom is infinity.

42
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,410
So your sample size is infinity or is like is huge.

43
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,790
That is a normal distribution.

44
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:04,020
So as new gets larger and larger and larger this whole thing it can register normal distribution.

45
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,300
So there's just something to keep in mind.

46
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,980
So it is a modification of the normal distribution and all it does is let's let's look at this orange

47
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,080
one for instance or the purple one you can see that it has heavier tails and it is useful because these

48
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,420
heavier tails suggests that this distribution that you're creating is you can actually produce values

49
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,730
further away from me.

50
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:31,790
So basically it allows for it facilitates outliers in an easier fashion than the normal distribution

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,870
so it's not as strict as a normal distribution.

52
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,820
And that's kind of like a penalty that you or the price you pay for having a small sample size so if

53
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,490
you still want to apply all of the same logic that we've been applying so far you can by using the t

54
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:50,040
distribution instead of the normal distribution but you will pay the price of it having law hightails

55
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,960
remember what we do have to tell the tale helps us reject the null hypothesis.

56
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,760
So we say if we're at 5 percent for instance in the normal the region we're at 5 percent we can reject

57
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,860
the null hypothesis.

58
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:06,080
Well in the t distribution the tail is thicker meaning your 5 percent it'll be further down on the tail

59
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,820
so if for a normal region the 5 percent sits over here or so if that's minus minus two standard deviations

60
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,540
then remember you're 5 percent sit somewhere like somewhere here below it before that minus 2 standard

61
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,120
deviations.

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,340
Well for a t distribution with few degrees of freedom like 1 your 5 percent will sit further away.

63
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,510
So it is basically it's harder to reject the null hypothesis when you're using the t distribution that

64
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,700
makes total sense because you have a small sample size.

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,830
So if it was as easy to reject the null hypothesis as in the case over a normal distribution then you

66
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:46,080
might get a lot of false positives you might all get a lot of situations where you can reject the null

67
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,540
hypothesis but in reality you shouldn't have rejected a new hypothesis simply because you know your

68
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,320
sample size was small and you had a sampling like you just you were lucky that you were able to reject

69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,270
that one hypothesis.

70
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:03,880
That's what the t distribution combat's the situation where because your sample size small you might

71
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,990
reject a little hypothesis.

72
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,170
In cases where you shouldn't have.

73
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,360
That's that's all it does.

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,810
And therefore it has these white thick or tails.

75
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:16,390
And as you can see as your degrees of freedom increases meaning your sample size increases your tails

76
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:22,810
get narrower and narrower and narrower and they approach and converge to a normal distribution as degrees

77
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,400
of freedom gets to infinity.

78
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,260
In fact it doesn't have to get to infinity as long as degrees of freedom is all around 30.

79
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,680
Your tea distribution is pretty much identical to a normal distribution.

80
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,420
So think of it as 30s at infinity.

81
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,220
So yeah that's what that is.

82
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,320
So it has heavier tails.

83
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,860
It describes as sample sets also important remember that the t distribution doesn't describe your population.

84
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:54,100
It describes a sample but it's kind of like a technicality or it's a more of a it's quite an important

85
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,950
underlying concept but it's not really going to affect us as much because we're going to come up with

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,520
a way we're going to approach it.

87
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:07,480
We're just going to have a standard process that we're going to be going through and we do it will already

88
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,420
take into account the fact that it describes a sample so but it's just probably good for you to know

89
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,910
that describes a sample rather than the distribution originally originally which we've been working

90
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,720
with so far normal distribution.

91
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,220
We use it as a distributor of the actual population but this doesn't stop us from making inferences.

92
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,620
You'll see we'll be able to make inferences using that distribution.

93
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,590
And another thing is the larger the sample the closer is anomalous region we've discussed that already.

94
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,720
So there we go.

95
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,320
Your degrees of freedom increases because up to the top.

96
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,610
So let's have a look at that in action.

97
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,580
And this is all from Wikipedia.

98
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,450
There's your research just look at Bleus your normal distribution ideal.

99
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,490
So that's when you get large sample size large blue is just a normal.

100
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,410
Red is the t distribution.

101
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:58,870
Then what happens is we increase the 1 degree of freedom meaning the sample size is equal to two sample

102
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,070
size equal to three two degrees of freedom.

103
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,180
What's happening is the red is the new t distribution Green is the old t distribution so all of the

104
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,990
old distributions are going to be in green.

105
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:13,900
Blue is still that normal distribution which you as you can see the red distribution's coming closer

106
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,540
so you go from here to here to here to here to here to here.

107
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,620
So as you can see it's getting closer and closer and closer.

108
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,090
So one two three five ten thirty.

109
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,320
So three degrees of freedom while That's the sample size of 31 but which is which is going to look you

110
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,840
can see it's still not exactly on the blue but it's very close.

111
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:40,270
So our cutoff point is going to be 30 and that's where these rules come from that we use a T distribution

112
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,140
or t test.

113
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,190
It's also called the t test.

114
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:49,630
You probably heard that when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small

115
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,970
less than 30.

116
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,980
So very important that both of these conditions are met.

117
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,630
So the way this is this is interesting how it works.

118
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:03,370
The t distribution as you can see here allows you to calculate it remember with using it would normally

119
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,500
have your sampling standard deviation here.

120
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,940
But in this case we have the sample standard deviation divided by the square of degrees of freedom.

121
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,830
So basically allows you to operate in environments where you do not know the standard deviation of the

122
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:27,670
population but at the same time so that is kind of like the normal thing for the t distribution population

123
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,210
that division is unknown.

124
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:38,310
But at the same time as we saw previously when your sample size is 30 or greater your t test your t

125
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,590
distribution is becomes identical to normal distribution.

126
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:47,560
So the question is what's the point of using a t distribution in a case where even though you don't

127
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,550
know the cell division of your population it is identical to normal distribution.

128
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,530
So in that case you just still just use a normal distribution and that's a pretty straightforward and

129
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,690
you can approximate your your standard deviation from your sample standard deviation.

130
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,310
And that's that's all you need to do.

131
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,080
So basically as soon as you hit that 30 mark what happens is your distribution becomes a center becomes

132
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,620
your normal distribution and Eve whichever approach you take.

133
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,710
Romans are you going to be doing the same thing.

134
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:23,110
So we just use n t distribution only in cases when we don't know the population standard deviation and

135
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,420
the sample size is small and is less than 30.

136
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,100
So there we go.

137
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,680
That's a quick intro into the t distribution and in the next part we're going to practice our very first

138
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,590
test.

139
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,930
Very exciting.

140
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,330
Can't wait to get started.

141
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,980
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

142
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,600
Until then happy analyzing.
