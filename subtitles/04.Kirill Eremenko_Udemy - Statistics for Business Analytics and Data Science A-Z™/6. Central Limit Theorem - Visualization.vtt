00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.400
Hello welcome back to the course on statistics in today's tutorial we will see.

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.650
The central limit theorem in practice.

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.590
So it's going to be our first step of seeing it in practice.

4
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.980
We're not going to be solving a business challenge yet but we'll see how it all comes to be.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.410
We'll see.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.530
Will be using this tool here which will help us visualize the process of how the central limit theorem

7
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.210
works.

8
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.550
So you can find this tool at our online stat book dot com slash stat or score sim for simulator site

9
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:38.110
sampling underscored just a session index that he mailed and a shout out to the people behind this for

10
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.090
creating this amazing tool.

11
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.260
So let's have a look.

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.000
Here we've got a distribution which is a normal distribution and we're going to be creating our sample

13
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.060
or our sampling distributions here all the sample mean.

14
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.030
So no it's not fun to work with a normal distribution because we can is still the central limit theorem

15
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.110
still applies to your original description on distribution.

16
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.280
But we want to prove a point we want to show that it will still work we will still get a normal distribution

17
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.150
for the sampling mean for the sampling distribution once with whatever original description we have.

18
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.170
So that's why here you can actually draw.

19
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.220
So let's roll something let's let's draw a distribution of our own kind what ever we want so you can

20
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.170
open up this tool and just draw your distribution.

21
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.680
So here we can we see the distribution with like four parts to it.

22
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.500
Maybe let's cut this down a little bit.

23
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.860
There we go.

24
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.420
So now we can see something that you can draw absolutely any type of distribution you like.

25
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.280
And now we're going to be going through the process so here you can see that you've got the mean 13:26.

26
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.860
There it is.

27
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.790
That's our mean.

28
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.580
So what the central limit theorem says is that if we start taking samples from this distribution and

29
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.580
then taking the mean of each of those samples and then putting them plotting them on their own distribution

30
00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.260
then we will slowly have a normal distribution which is centered around that same mean.

31
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.170
All right so let's have a look with our and is set to five here.

32
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.410
You can change it if you want.

33
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.190
You can change it to whatever number you want.

34
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.660
And that is that is the size of your sample.

35
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.240
So there's a few parameters that are involved here.

36
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.420
This is how many elements you're going to take from this distribution in and inside every single sample.

37
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.840
And then the buttons here they tell you how many samples you want to take.

38
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.400
So I was going to click this one button and we will take one sample.

39
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.110
So there we go we're taking one sample which has five elements and that is the mean.

40
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.780
So you can see it randomly took values from this distribution 1 2 3 4 5 and that is the mean.

41
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.090
Here's another one.

42
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.140
One two three four five.

43
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.980
There it is.

44
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.100
So as you can see that's our series starting to build something solid.

45
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.520
Another one two three four five go.

46
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.170
Either one yes.

47
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.510
This Keep going.

48
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.790
So you can see it's slowly starting to build up so it's just sitting here and doing one at a time.

49
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.660
So there that's another five I clicked it twice.

50
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.300
We can do.

51
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.120
You can see that your reps done five.

52
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.740
We can do it.

53
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.580
We can just do five right away.

54
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.240
We're going to 5 5 5 so you can see already something's starting to build in this area.

55
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.020
So I mean is blue and there we're building something in this area already.

56
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.640
Let's keep building so.

57
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.960
To join the 5 5 5 5 5 and so on.

58
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.120
So as you can see it's slowly starting to build up as solid is starting to look more and more like a

59
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.330
normal distribution and you can see how the mean here is changing how the median standard deviation

60
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.090
Well we're not that interested in the median right now we're just talking about means that deviation

61
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.830
you can see the mean is slowly coming closer and closer to the mean here.

62
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.250
And as I remember Stand deviation will be.

63
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.110
It should be this that deviation divide by the square root of 5.

64
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.220
So because we have five in our sample here.

65
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.500
So keep building keep building keep building.

66
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.220
So there's a 10000 to 10000 You can see it's very close or a normal distribution.

67
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.860
All right so there we go.

68
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.010
Let's do another one let's say.

69
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.130
So that here is a thirteen point sixteen point eighty six and if you take a stand deviation of nine

70
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.770
point fifty two and you divide by square five you will get four point twenty five we can check out on

71
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.000
the calculator.

72
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.390
All right.

73
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.760
So what is the square root of five.

74
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.670
That's the number two point twenty three.

75
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.580
And so if we now take two point two three six.

76
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.440
So if we take nine point fifty two.

77
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:41.590
Nine point fifty two divided by two point two three six 4.2 five seven four point five.

78
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.030
There we go so exactly that is is not theoretical This is actually empirical it's just happening as

79
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.760
we're doing rather than just a calculation and then we just confirmed with the calculation which is

80
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.970
cool.

81
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.270
OK so what do we also do.

82
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.860
Can we do here.

83
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.940
Let's clear the lower three are affecting our distribution.

84
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.510
And now what we want to do is let's change it to.

85
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.030
Of five Let's take two let's see what happens so every inside our every sample is only going to be two

86
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.170
blocks.

87
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:15.280
So here is where you can actually not necessarily break the the concept but it's not going to be as

88
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.940
accurate so if you take 10000 You can see that it's much harder for it to conform to that normal distribution

89
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.630
because simply because as you can imagine by taking two samples it's very very hard just to get all

90
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.420
of the whole range of these values and is going to just take longer but C in some cases it will just

91
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.390
it just might not be possible to obtain the normal attrition just because the sample sample size itself

92
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:47.140
is very small so you can see like it's trying but this is kind of like a precaution to not set the sample

93
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.870
size to two but as soon as you go like five or even 10 10 is usually enough for any kind of distribution

94
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.880
you might have here.

95
00:05:53.890 --> 00:06:01.420
So anything you might Droi here 10 is usually going to be enough in order to make it a normal distribution

96
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.080
in the long run.

97
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.290
So you might have something like that completely random completely strange.

98
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.230
You have like completely empty values here.

99
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.910
So let's have a look at that.

100
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:19.750
So if you take animator's you taking 10 this time and then you get this you know that's you mean you

101
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.020
know what.

102
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.020
Let's clear this and let's do the zoomin 10 here and the zoo five here and see how they you can do them

103
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.420
at the same time let's see how the hully compare.

104
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.490
So we do fine so we're going to do 10 here

105
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.650
and then this is five I think.

106
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.160
That's five for that one so.

107
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:44.410
So this is going to be taking a sample for this chart and this is taking a sample sample and the average

108
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.840
for that.

109
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.750
So we do five at a time.

110
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.980
You can see like this one is already at I mean a 1093 this one's 15 18.

111
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.920
Not too bad but getting there.

112
00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.910
So slowly building up you can see it's it's much harder for these guys to build a normal distribution

113
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.230
this central in that room versus the central limit there.

114
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.780
There's a 10000 You can see that this was good doing.

115
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.440
Not that bad actually.

116
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.130
100000.

117
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.760
OK.

118
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.940
Well it looks like a normal distribution not ideal but already looks close.

119
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.930
So if we were to change this to something else if we increase this even further than our would be even

120
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:23.230
better.

121
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.240
So let's clear them this too.

122
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.770
So 10 apparently is not.

123
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.000
It still looks like an odd description but not ideal.

124
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.690
So if we do 10000 now you can see there you go.

125
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:39.350
And you can also see what we discussed before so is a 10 here 20 here and 25 for instance.

126
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:47.610
And around 10000 You can see that when you increase n this distribution becomes more becomes narrower.

127
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:47.940
Right.

128
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:53.980
So another 10000 you see this one is a bit wider This one is a bit narrower or less to less clear lower

129
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.350
three and as do I 16.

130
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.090
So there you can see the big difference here.

131
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.880
So this one is wider and this one is narrower and that is speaking to the standard deviation and vision

132
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.730
here is three division here is two point forty five.

133
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:13.690
Well that's because our sample size is twenty five here so here are some revisions twelve point thirty

134
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.150
to get this standard deviation need to divide by the square root of 16 which is four.

135
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.960
That's why they have these numbers here 16:25.

136
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:27.430
It's worldwide by square of 16 which is four it gets three so you get about 3 over here and here divide

137
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.020
by a square of twenty five which is five.

138
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.030
So twelve point thirty two I'd buy five.

139
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.160
He had two point forty five.

140
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:39.070
So and that shows exactly that that when our sample size is higher our resulting normal distribution

141
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.800
is going to be narrower.

142
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:47.950
So there you go that's a really cool tool to visualize what's what's going on in the world of the Central

143
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:48.960
Limit Theorem.

144
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.820
I hope you enjoy this story and make sure to check out this tool and play around with it for yourself

145
00:08:53.830 --> 00:09:00.400
and that will really help you solidify this knowledge and kind of like have a visual anchor to remember

146
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.660
what the central limit theorem is all about.

147
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.980
And I look forward to seeing you in the next Tauriel.

148
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.760
Until then happy analyzing.
