mean can be the other way around.
1
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.150
And if it's if it's going either way of is possibly skewed.

2
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.630
OK Mode's at the top.

3
00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.190
What can be what has to be the next one all the golf abettor clear eyed so you can never have the mean

4
00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.830
in-between the median the mode.

5
00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.690
It's always the median is in between two modes here.

6
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.450
Median mean you will always remember which is which.

7
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:14.380
So yeah just just remember that and of course if it's like in this case they couldn't go this way they

8
00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:19.820
always go into the soil was the direction of the long from the more they go towards the direction of

9
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.730
the longer tail.

10
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.450
So just a quick visual trick on how to remember them.

11
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:30.970
So again you're always on top on your feet when you're speaking the statistics language.

12
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:31.650
So there you go.

13
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.900
That's the mean median mode.

14
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.250
Hope you enjoyed.

15
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.600
Historial and look for them.

16
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.170
Until then happy analyzing.
 look at for example the underlying data.

17
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.230
What does the underlying data look like.

18
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.300
There it is.

19
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.320
That's all the underlying data is written out that is characterized by this probability density function.

20
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.970
Again just to reiterate one more time a distribution is something that is attached to the data rather

21
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.200
than a chart.

22
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.140
You don't have to have a chart to have a distribution.

23
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.860
The data has a distribution.

24
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:21.000
We're just visualizing it with this probability density function to simplify our understanding and to

25
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.250
help us visually assess things.

26
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.370
So now we're going to look at as the title for this tutorial just mean median MULHER we're going to

27
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.630
plot these things and understand what they are.

28
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.760
So I mean we just take all values and we take the average of them.

29
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.440
We take average mean they're synonymous.

30
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.680
So we clot the mean here at sixty four point ninety eight.

31
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.370
Somewhere over there on this chart.

32
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.590
So that pretty straightforward we've already worked with them before.

33
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.770
Next we're going to talk about the medium.

34
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.840
So what is the median.

35
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.200
The median is very interesting and that's why I actually wrote out these values here so far for I mean

36
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.560
you can just you know add them up.

37
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.970
But for the media to understand it better it's a really good idea to write them out.

38
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.140
So what you need to do for the median is you need to take an equivalent number of values from the left

39
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.150
and the same number of values from the right.

40
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.480
So let's do that.

41
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.830
There we go.

42
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:23.550
So we've got one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 here and one two three four five

43
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.120
six seven eight nine 10 11 12.

44
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.310
So you need to take it equal values equal numbers of values and the maximum.

45
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.940
So you can take like five and five.

46
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.490
You need to take as many as you can and you will either have a situation where you have one in the middle

47
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.120
if you have an odd number of values in your data or you have nothing in the middle if you have an even

48
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.370
number of values.

49
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.440
In either case just put a vertical A imaginary vertical line between these two.

50
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.480
Even if it goes through some some value if it goes through the value then that is going to be your median

51
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.120
that values going to be a median.

52
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.740
In our case that is the case that 63 or.

53
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.460
If there is no value here then your median will be the average between these two so sixty three point

54
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.250
seven plus 64 divided by two is your media that would have been the case if we if we had an even number

55
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.950
of records in our days.

56
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.510
The important thing to remember here and something that I remember when I was kind of like getting into

57
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.800
this space I always kept wondering is it the case or not the case.

58
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.900
So I think visual anchors are the best I'm going to give you a visual anchor now so you always remember

59
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.260
this thing forever.

60
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.840
What do you do of duplicates.

61
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.440
The answer is you include duplicates so you can see here we've got sixty two point five.

62
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.530
Three times you included in writing out so you don't just write sixty two point five at once.

63
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.610
No not that confusion in my understanding came from the way I think thinking about I was thinking about

64
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.260
as a chart thing I guess so what is this chart doing.

65
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.820
Aha.

66
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.140
OK.

67
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.440
So what if I want to get the middle here.

68
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.190
Do I get the middle of the chart.

69
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.100
Do I take the minimum the maximum and get the middle of the chart.

70
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.140
Well in that case then you want that's that's exactly what would happen if you wouldn't take the duplicate

71
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.620
token because you just have all the values here.

72
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.740
And in fact it's not even what would happen because you know it just happened the middle of the range

73
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.550
rather than the media and that would be something completely incorrect.

74
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.240
But still I was thinking Oh yeah what's the chart doing is the chart taking the duplicates and all gone

75
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.830
or not.

76
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.900
Forget about the chart.

77
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.170
Just think of it the data what does the data doing in the data.

78
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.990
Do you have duplicates if you do have to because you do take them into account.

79
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.610
So there you go.

80
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.170
So you have duplicates here you can see more we have duplicates here.

81
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.330
We have another duplicate value over here so we do write all of the values out regardless of their duplicate

82
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.220
or not we just write all of them out.

83
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.660
Then we get the median.

84
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.120
The beauty about the median.

85
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.580
It's like I mean it's very similar to the mean.

86
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.450
It's a lot of the time you'll actually hear people in analysis use the median instead of the mean and

87
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.620
the reason for that.

88
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.920
Most of the time the reason for that is that the median is not affected by outliers it is affected by

89
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:06.190
outliers but a very it so just think of this example if the incentive 2:53 we had here 1 million.

90
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.380
So you had what is this.

91
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.550
This is height right as height and inches.

92
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.860
OK so we could have one million here somebody could be 1 million inches tall.

93
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.180
Probably not but we could still have one million here if for example in a dataset you have an anomaly

94
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.130
or an irregularity or something or let's say even if we don't have an in a million but we have like

95
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.590
a very tall person 2.5 meters tall the tallest person on the planet.

96
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:37.140
So I'm not sure how much it'll be in inches but let me just quickly check it so I checked and 2.5 meters

97
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.810
is 98 inches so let's say you have somebody who's 100 inches tall here obviously that's a that's an

98
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.450
outlier.

99
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.440
That's somebody who's very much told very different to the rest of our data and the mean is going to

100
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.490
be affected a lot because you're going to calculate add that in your average sense like is pretty much

101
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.810
like adding to people or you know one and a half people into your into your calculation and Eastern

102
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.990
so this mean will increase substantially.

103
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.970
Not the same way but crease as if this was 73 or if this was you know 80 or 65.

104
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.240
Not as if it was a normal value like an expected type of value.

105
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.540
But if you calculate the median if you have 100 inches here the median is going to be the same it isn't

106
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.770
going to change because it's simply you count the number here and the number here you get the middle

107
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.390
you don't.

108
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.520
It does it's not affected by.

109
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.790
So even if you had a million here your median would not be affected.

110
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.550
So that's that's a part of the median and sometimes that is helpful.

111
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.560
Sometimes people do were as you'll see will be using the mean a lot but that just so you know that in

112
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.260
some cases the median can be more useful.

113
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.450
All right so that's mean median and nélisse about the mode.

114
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:50.220
So the mode in in a discrete probability distribution visualization is much easier to see the mode in

115
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.700
this one.

116
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.760
It's also not that hard you just look at the very top part.

117
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.730
So the highest part of your distribution in that case in this case is us there and then you find that

118
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:05.530
that points in your probability density function which is the highest and most amount here is sixty

119
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.570
two point five.

120
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.140
The very very top part.

121
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.880
So you put a line through it and you see where it crosses.

122
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.740
Why is it easier for a discrete distribution.

123
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.930
Because they have buckets and you just basically have rectangles and you just pick the highest rectangle

124
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.140
and you see what buckets associated with.

125
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.990
So it's usually labeled and you can see right away they're here.

126
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.040
Here you have to like actually think about it not think about just like put the slide through it but

127
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.390
and it's easier to understand in the discrete distribution you have buckets so that what is the mode

128
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.820
or the mode is the most frequent value the more.

129
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:44.940
So if you have let's say Germany France Spain and England and you and Germany has the highest bucket

130
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.130
in a in a discrete distribution that means the most frequent value is Germany.

131
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:49.920
That's it.

132
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:55.430
Out of out of your dataset or out of what the distribution function is describing.

133
00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:01.320
Whereas here you can say that because as we discussed the possibility of getting this value exactly

134
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.220
zero.

135
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:08.820
So the mode is actually it's not that intuitive You can't just say it's the most frequent value it's

136
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:15.390
the value that if you take a little area around it it will be the most likely area as opposed to anywhere

137
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:20.280
else you take that same same area of with that type of thing because remember you have to always take

138
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.230
a range.

139
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.590
So that's the mode but the easiest way is just look at the chart and the find the top part.

140
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.530
That's where the mode is so mean median mode.

141
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:36.880
And just to reiterate on the mode as you can see 61 why this is relevant for us or this is the case

142
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.140
was it a said because you see 60 to 60 to 62 62.

143
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.820
He said that he sees that he sees two hundred five.

144
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.860
So you can see it somewhere on there again in a discrete distribution if we like we fool around and

145
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:53.960
all of these down to the first 2 0 decimal points and this will be 60 to 6 to 60 to 62.

146
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.360
And this would be the most frequent value.

147
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.720
That's what we wanted to do if we wanted to bucketed we could market it like from you know different

148
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.900
ways you could do 60 to 50 60 to 65 65 70 is on again we would be able to find them more there as well.

149
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:07.380
OK.

150
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:13.630
So that's that's the mode what I wanted to do is let's have a look at so mean more.

151
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:21.380
Let's have a look at how they are arranged in positively in a negatively skewed as opposed to rescue

152
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.170
distribution.

153
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.380
The others are here.

154
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.330
Let's flip this over and see how their range here.

155
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:32.550
So in a negative skew distribution they are arranged in the following manner.

156
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.560
So naturally they just range in opposite direction to what the mean here.

157
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.300
The median name on it that's always going to be the case for a distribution that was never going negatively

158
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.810
skewed You always going to have the mean the median mode or the possibly skew you're going to have the

159
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:52.140
more the median mean and the way to remember it is I'm going to give you a visual clue how to remember

160
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:58.730
this is like I had to come up with this myself in order to remember in which order they go because I

161
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.190
like it it was obvious now went through it but when you just see a distribution and somebody asked you

162
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.730
where's the median and mode.

163
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.590
And he said maybe just see some points outline but not labeled.

164
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.440
You know it'll be hard to realize which ones which.

165
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.320
But just remember look at them they go alphabetically.

166
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.560
So there's a visual clue.

167
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.720
So if this is the m e a.

168
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.800
So that's the first one.

169
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.490
M e d.

170
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.510
That's the second one em all alphabetically.

171
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.460
That's the way.

172
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:30.310
And just kind of think of it in like if it's a negatively skewed distribution then it's mean median

173
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:35.020
mode that way if it's supposedly skewed distribution it's going to be more median mean.

174
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.160
So you just have to remember one of them you just have to remember mode that it's always at the top

175
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.030
it's always at the peak.

176
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.080
That's where the mode is.

177
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.840
And from there regardless of which way it's facing if it's facing this way like this one if it's negatively

178
00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:51.010
skewed just Gog and Mode's here on the golf Brickley So this has to be the median and it has to be the
1
