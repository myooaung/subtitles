00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,170
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,070
Today's a quick tutorial to introduce the normal distribution.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,140
So let's dive straight in.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,910
Here is the normal distribution.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:18,620
This is what it looks like sometimes called the Bell Curve but that's a bit of a stretch because there's

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,380
a lot of distributions that have the same shape.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,250
The main definition of the normal distribution is its equation.

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,070
That's the equation for the probability density function so it is a continuous distribution as we can

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,080
see where they're going to go into detail that's just to say that there is an equation that describes

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:36,790
distribution.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,130
And as you can see it includes Sigma.

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,810
So our standard deviation Sigma squared variance or standard deviation squared.

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:52,820
And it also includes myu which is our center our median what these numbers mean here are the probabilities

14
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,600
of a random variable which is following the normal distribution to be to actually end up like are coming

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,710
from one of these areas are to be being in these ranges.

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,000
So remember we spoke about the probability for it like for a continuous distribution.

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,910
We help build the density function hence the P over there.

18
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:17,840
You can't say exactly that the probability of being over here or picking a random variable that's going

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,970
to be here you cannot tell what the perimeter of that is because we're going to be zero.

20
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,980
But you can tell what the probability of a certain range is.

21
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:30,110
Well and when you see images of the normal distribution you'll see that it's usually like broken down

22
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,140
into these ranges already so it's if me the mean here is zero.

23
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,120
In this case it's zero.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,800
But you could it could be immune so it's totally fine if it's not center on the earth center on me.

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,930
Then this formula will still apply and then from myu you go right like standard deviation.

26
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,680
Remember we said you can add standard deviations to your mean because they're the same units or you

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,380
subtract one standard deviation so the probability of a variable falling between zero and one standard

28
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,690
deviation is always going to thirty four point one percent for normal distribution or Usually what people

29
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:09,440
say is probability of a variable falling between minus 1 second deviation and one second deviation is

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,760
sixty eight point two percent probability of falling between minus two standard deviations and two standard

31
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:24,970
deviations is ninety five point six percent and the probability of falling between minus two standard

32
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,240
deviations and two standard vision.

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,080
So in this whole area here is about 95 percent and so on.

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,860
So those are a given for you and me and we'll discuss more about the standard or the normal distribution

35
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,480
further down the course.

36
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:43,260
But the question is why is it so popular why is it so so amazing what's so great about the normal distribution.

37
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:50,390
Well what's great about it is that it comes up a lot in the world and things are just just happened

38
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,190
to be distributed normally.

39
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,550
And there's actually a reason behind it.

40
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,440
While some of these things there's a reason behind it so for instance here you've got an example of

41
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,570
what height the heights of a man on the left and heights of women on the right.

42
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,150
So you can see that there are approximately normally distributed.

43
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,630
These are 20 year old people and so the more people you have in your decision in your sample the better

44
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,930
it will approximate to a normal distribution.

45
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,340
And there's there's lots of other events for instance.

46
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,660
Here's one I thought you would be interested to know that the probability density function of a ground

47
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:33,440
state in a quantum harmonic oscillator is exactly normally distributed so I just read that out from

48
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,560
Wikipedia but it just stands to say that this is maybe an approximate normal distribution but they are

49
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,860
things in the world.

50
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,450
For instance in quantum mechanics which are exactly normally distributed which is just mind boggling.

51
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,160
Like why would it be exactly normally distributed.

52
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,470
Very interesting.

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,350
When I mentioned that there are some things that we can explain why it's happening this way.

54
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,060
That's when we apply the Central Limit Theorem.

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,670
The central limit theorem is something we will cover often this course it's very exciting very exciting

56
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,310
topics one of the most powerful if not the most powerful theorems in mathematics in the whole of mathematics

57
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,660
and that is exactly because it deals with the normal distribution.

58
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,550
And when you combine the two central limit theorem and normal disruption it kind of explains a lot of

59
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:22,520
things that we see in the world why they're normally distributed and therefore why we're able to really

60
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,650
progress further with research and lots of these things because we can leverage the normal normality

61
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,270
of those things so that's yet to come in for a down discourse.

62
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,420
It will be very exciting.

63
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,020
But for now there's a quick quick introduction to the distribution.

64
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,880
And yeah so now we can move on for the rest of the trolls in the section.

65
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,100
Hope you enjoyed this trial.

66
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,030
And until next time happy analyzing.
