00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.430
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.150
Today we're going to jump straight into practical application of hypothesis testing.

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.520
I know this might sound a bit crazy that we're doing this right away but the thing is that we've already

4
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.060
discussed the Central Limit Theorem.

5
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.410
So we already have the apparatus that is required to perform hypothesis testing.

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.290
Moreover we've also talked about statistical significance.

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.290
So that will also aid us in today's tutorial.

8
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.340
So let's get straight into it right away we've got a real world challenge.

9
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.460
In 2015 millennials we're watching twenty six point five hours of TV a week with a standard deviation

10
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.450
of 10 hours.

11
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.900
Today you surveyed 50 millennials and found that they watched 24 hours of TV a week has the parameter

12
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.900
decreased.

13
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.900
Now this is a real data sets or some real statistics.

14
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.640
The twenty six point five hours in 2015 for millennials is indeed true.

15
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.050
The 10 hour send deviation that's what I estimated from what I could find on the Internet.

16
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.100
And the question here is very interesting as well because what we've seen in the previous years is a

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.630
trend where people watch more and more and more to see what this result is suggesting that perhaps millennials

18
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.700
have started watching less TVs from 2015.

19
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.590
So twenty six and a half hours now what we're seeing in our sample is 24 hours.

20
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.380
So we want to test this hypothesis that the number of hours per week that they're watching TV has decreased.

21
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.240
And why is this an important problem.

22
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.530
So while this could be a question that a business is faced with for instance if you're working for a

23
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.280
company that produces a certain type of app for the phone or maybe you are producing clothes that are

24
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.840
targeted towards millennials So something that a product that is for millennials and you want to find

25
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.780
out where to do advertising do you want to do advertising on TV or do you want to do advertising on

26
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.360
other mediums such as Internet or through maybe banners somewhere or something.

27
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.020
So you want to understand is TV a good strategy for a business going forward.

28
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.430
And as you can imagine it's a big call to make.

29
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.300
You have to be confident in this decision because ultimately this is something that is going to either

30
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.320
really bring revenue to your business or it's not going to bring revenue is going to just be a huge

31
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.680
expense going forward.

32
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.240
And that's why something like this is important you know important problem to solve and it's important

33
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.120
to understand how to answer this question with statistical significance or with sufficient confidence

34
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.340
in your answer.

35
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.670
So let's go through the steps of testing this hypothesis.

36
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.770
Step one is you need to state the null hypothesis the null hypothesis here is that the parameter has

37
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.170
not decreased or it mean is twenty six point five or greater.

38
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.810
Like it's important to note here that it's just equal to twice of how it could have actually increased.

39
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.830
And that's why equal or greater than or equal to so we're taking the greater than partners well.

40
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.740
Step two is to state the alternative hypothesis which is H-1 the parabola has decreased.

41
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.440
So the mean is less than twenty six point five.

42
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.130
So notice that if we do reject the null hypothesis in the end we can say that the average is 24 hours.

43
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.220
We can only say that the average has decreased compared to what it was that's all.

44
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.970
But just bear in mind that it's important to understand what are the two universes that we're choosing

45
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.030
between the one where it's equal great equal to or greater than 5:26 or it has decreased.

46
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.650
That's all the options we have in the approach of hypothesis testing.

47
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.030
OK so now we're going to look at how we're going to solve it.

48
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.370
And what you'll find is that it will be very similar to what we did with the Central Limit Theorem how

49
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.800
we applied it to solve analytics challenges in the previous section of the course.

50
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.390
So that's going to be a huge plus because it will help us get a head start.

51
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.640
All right.

52
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.880
So first things first we're going to draw our diagram for the sampling distribution and this is just

53
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.490
to refresh our knowledge that the central limit of states that the sampling distribution is always going

54
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.760
to be a normal distribution and that the few other things that you know the mean is equal to the mean

55
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.950
or the population salvation is calculated through the standard patient population divide by the square

56
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.830
root of the sample size.

57
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.270
But basically this is going to be a useful picture for us because we're going to be leveraging what

58
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.450
looks like and we're going to be drawing things on here to understand the intuition behind things.

59
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.500
So let's get rid of these samples.

60
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.920
Basically what we're saying here is that these 50 millennials they come from somewhere in this distribution.

61
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.530
So even though this sample came from the population of millennials of the total population of millennials

62
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.360
we also know is that the all of the possible samples that could have ever existed from that population

63
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.060
whereas the sample size is 50.

64
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.680
They are distributed like this.

65
00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.460
So whether we like it or not this 50 millennial sample came from somewhere in this.

66
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.130
So that's that's kind of what we're operating with here.

67
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.380
So there's going to have those expire.

68
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.350
Well let's draw our mean and Salvation Army in the middle and that's one standard deviation to the right

69
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.940
one to the left to to the right to the left.

70
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.560
OK so let's now start applying the concepts that we already know Mubako me ex-parte is equal to equal

71
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.550
to twenty six point five.

72
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.160
That's one of the things about the central and the theorem this mean is equal to the mean of the population

73
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:35.080
deviation of Sigma X bar is equal to the center of population divided by the square root of the number

74
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.460
of observations is one point for the one in our case and X bar is equal to 24.

75
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.710
So let's plot it over here because this is twenty six point five.

76
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.960
Now I know it may not yet be clear why exactly we're performing all these calculations and what we're

77
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.380
aiming to achieve here.

78
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.040
By the way there's our expert.

79
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:59.200
So let's discuss that let's understand what is our approach here and what is intuition behind all these

80
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.180
things that we're doing.

81
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.480
So what we're aiming to achieve is we're trying to just as with the situation trying to understand is

82
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:14.140
it plausible that what happened everything that we have is that you describe here what happened happened.

83
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.890
Given that the null hypothesis is true.

84
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:25.840
So will we feel OK intuitive terms will we feel OK or yet will we feel OK with the fact that what happened

85
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.430
happened or will we feel suspicious about it.

86
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.630
And what that translates to into is that.

87
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:37.450
All right so let's assume that as we were saying in the null hypothesis that myu is equal to or greater

88
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.770
than twenty six point five.

89
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.480
And in fact we're saying that mews exactly twenty six point five and we'll get to that in a second why

90
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.630
we're saying that it's exactly 26 right.

91
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.710
But let's just agree that where this is equivalent to this so we're saying it's twenty six point five.

92
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:57.610
So we know that new X bar is already here as well so we know that the mean of the sampling distribution

93
00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.110
is twenty six point five.

94
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:05.370
And we know from the sample central limit theorem that this 50 millennial sample that we picked we picked

95
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:11.860
up from the population but at the same time the central limit theorem says that any or all of the 50

96
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.970
millennials or 50 person samples were possibly picked.

97
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.500
They are distributed like this.

98
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.230
That's what the sampling distribution is.

99
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.580
They are distributed like this.

100
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.470
So the sample that we picked has to come from this distribution as well.

101
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.880
And what we're saying is we can see that this is 24 hours this is twenty six point five.

102
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.270
So we're saying we can see this on the left.

103
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:39.310
The question is how likely is it that we just randomly picked a sample and it ended up so far away from

104
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:39.760
home.

105
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.410
We know that was from what we know about the normal distribution is.

106
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:50.530
That's about between the first standard deviation we're here between minus 1 contribution plus was enervation

107
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:57.550
we got about 68 percent of all of the observations they fall in here and between the two standard deviations

108
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.010
so minus two plus two.

109
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:04.480
We have about a ninety five point four ninety five and a half of all the observations fall in between

110
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.350
these two sensations.

111
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:13.720
The question is is it plausible that this X bar which you pick which we just drew here arbitrary We'll

112
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:20.350
find out exactly where it is it might be here might be here might be there but the point is is it plausible

113
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:27.370
that if given that this is twenty six point five that we picked this one at random or so or does it

114
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:35.080
fall so far away from the mean which is might be here might here might be so far away that it is just

115
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.680
unlikely that we would have picked it.

116
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:44.520
So if the solution is true around this mean then we would have been very unlikely to pick this ex-parte

117
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.530
at random that's exactly what we're going to be testing.

118
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.160
So similar to the situation we had with the coins.

119
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:54.640
Is it likely or is it extremely unlikely that this would have been picked at random given that this

120
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.230
is correct and that kind of shed some light on why we're seeing that news.

121
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:07.510
Zachary 5:26 the reason for that is that if we said myu to something that is less than great and then

122
00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:14.260

123
5:26 then the distance will be even greater and will be easier for us to prove that the null hypothesis

124
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.730
is incorrect.

125
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:23.470
So the hardest scenario win or the sonata when it is hardest for us to prove that or to reject the null

126
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:31.420
hypothesis is when this is as close to the new as are the sample mean that we measured as possible.

127
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:37.750
So for example if mu X was not 5:26 but it was so this distribution wasn't here but it was like here.

128
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:43.300
So you x we said is 30 for instance and this question was here then the distance is already so great

129
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:49.750
there will be so easy for us to prove that this would have had this is unlikely to happen at random

130
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.070
and reject the null hypothesis.

131
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:58.360
We want to reject an all hypothesis in the most difficult circumstances for us as possible so that we

132
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.000
take into account all other circumstances.

133
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:07.250
Well and the most difficult way to reject an ill hypothesis is when new is exactly equal to any success

134
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:13.430
because in that case this distance is is already as small as it can get and therefore it's harder for

135
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.700
us.

136
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.620
You know this X bar might actually sneak in and might be very close to new acts and that in that case

137
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.360
it's very likely that we picked this X bar and we can reject the hypothesis.

138
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.650
But that's exactly what we're going to be testing.

139
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:30.560
How far is X bar from new x in terms of standard deviations so that we can reject all hypothesis or

140
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.680
we can't reject all hypothesis.

141
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.470
So there we go.

142
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:34.440
Let's have a look.

143
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.900
Hopefully that clarifies what we're going to be doing now and from here it's just it's all mechanical.

144
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:46.670
So here we just that there's our X bar calculate the Zed score as we did previously in the tutorials

145
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:53.160
on the central limit theorem as renos as core is simply just the distance between the mean and the x.

146
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.360
So we go like OK what's the difference what's the distance.

147
00:10:55.370 --> 00:11:00.290
And now is the way of salvation so we know how many standard deviations we have in the distance.

148
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:06.620
It's 24 minutes twenty six point five do it by one point forty one equals minus one point seventy seven

149
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.390
so we didn't plot exactly correctly.

150
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.520
It's actually supposed to be over here so it's moved where it's supposed to be.

151
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.730
And now we're going to go calculate the p value.

152
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:16.970
Very simple.

153
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.390
So P-value.

154
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:24.500
OK let me just bring it up here so Zed is minus one point seventy seven.

155
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.200
So minus one point seven.

156
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.930
There we go.

157
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:38.950
And pointone So this black line this top line so you can see that here we have ZERO POINT 3 8 4.

158
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.140
OK so that's minus zero point is 3 8 4.

159
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.150
And now let's go back to our presentation.

160
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.060
So there it is zero point zero 3 8 4 so that's three point eighty four percent.

161
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.540
And so what does that mean.

162
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.880
Well that means.

163
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.600
Well that is less than five.

164
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.650
That's that's important.

165
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:04.070
But what that means is that it is only three point eighty four percent likely that we were to pick a

166
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.470
sample in this area.

167
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:12.380
So let's go back to this slide so you can see that this is the probability for a mean actually being

168
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.420
in this low to the left of our statistic.

169
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:23.690
So the probability of us picking a sample in this area and all of this area on the left of this red

170
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:28.820
line is only three point eighty four percent so the further left you go the lesser the probability becomes

171
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.210
it becomes less and less because of tails dropping off less and less and less.

172
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:38.300
But so in this whole area three point eighty four only in this whole area it's three point eighty four

173
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:38.560
percent.

174
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.240
And that's exactly where ex-parte came from.

175
00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.020
So the probability.

176
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:50.090
So what we're saying is that the probability of us picking x bar is only three point eighty four percent.

177
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:56.540
So if the null hypothesis is true in this world that we live in that we've decided that is the true

178
00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:02.680
world in this universe where myu is greater than or equal to twenty six point five.

179
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.040
The probability of this happening what we have.

180
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.320
What we saw the possibility was going out and surveying at random 50 millennials and finding out that

181
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:16.970
they were 24 that the mean of the hours they watch TV per week is 24 hours is so unlikely is only three

182
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:17.840
point eighty four percent.

183
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.420
So in this universe it's only there's only three point eighty four percent chance of that happening.

184
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:28.820
Just like with the coin toss and therefore we get very intuitive terms we get very suspicious.

185
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:34.850
We're like this is very unlikely something is going on here.

186
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.650
This is this cannot be true.

187
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:43.670
We don't we get we get very suspicious about it so we say OK that value is actually less than 5 percent.

188
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:48.590
And so with a 95 percent confidence we're going to reject the null hypothesis.

189
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:53.990
We're going to say that the new hypothesis cannot possibly be well it cannot be true of a 95 percent

190
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.210
confidence.

191
00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:01.190
We're saying that with a 95 percent confidence that the null hypothesis cannot be true because we were

192
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:07.340
able to randomly magically pick out the sample and the mean was so low compared to our assumed meaning

193
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.330
of twenty six point five.

194
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:16.220
And so therefore what is true is the alternative hypothesis and the mean has decreased so the mean of

195
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.910
the population is actually no longer twenty six point five.

196
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.560
It's less than that.

197
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:26.570
And in business terms that's probably a call for you or your company to make on whether you want to

198
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.730
do the advertising on TV or not.

199
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:34.400
Given that the meat has decreased so maybe you are taking to cut this number but which you got from

200
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:39.550
2015 you don't have a new number for 2017 or whatever year you're in now.

201
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.730
So you just went out and surveyed people and you found out.

202
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.800
Oh it's actually decreased.

203
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.030
So we don't know.

204
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.350
There is no statistic.

205
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:52.250
It is no parameter or statistic that's been released publicly from serving companies from like large

206
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.120
census and stuff like that.

207
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.390
But at the same time just through this little quick experiment we were able to nudge 5 percent confidence

208
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:06.880
say that this number is no longer true that it has dropped and therefore we cannot use this number in

209
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.270
our calculations for the revenue.

210
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.710
Are we going to be getting from advertising all the things like that.

211
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.570
So there we go.

212
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:17.710
Hopefully that makes sense and we'll definitely do lots more of these throughout the course and in different

213
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:23.050
variations so you'll get used to them and you'll better understand and get a better feel for the intuition

214
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.000
behind things.

215
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.810
And as I mentioned previously that is as kind of the goal we should have the record because I'm doing

216
00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:34.810
mathematics as you can see is easy it's about intuition and about like visualizing this in your mind.

217
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:40.870
That's the actual the real benefits or the added benefit that you can get on top of just learning the

218
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:41.580
mathematics.

219
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.060
And so if it's not a hundred percent clear yet don't worry about it.

220
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:50.290
We will do more examples and it will become clearer and clearer as we do more of these and you'll get

221
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.410
used to it over time.

222
00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.000
So there we go that's how we do.

223
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:59.800
Those are the steps that are involved in hypothesis testing in the next tutorial we will have a second

224
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.840
approach we'll look at a second approach to this.

225
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.040
This the same steps.

226
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:10.180
There's just like it's a slightly different tours and it's called the rejection region and you might

227
00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:14.890
be if you've done the disappearing might be used to that and also that's just a good approach to have

228
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:15.770
a look at.

229
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.750
So you have to in your arsenal.

230
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.900
So I look forward to an extent.

231
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.520
And until then happy analyzing.
