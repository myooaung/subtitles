2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,020

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,440
Hope you're enjoying the tutorial so far.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,620
Now in this area I'm going to take you on a quick walk through Africa.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,070
How random is that.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,090
So I'm in a small village here and I'm in on my morning walk.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,580
Wanted to show you around while we're here.

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,520
I also wanted to give you a quick heads up.

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,360
Very soon you do me is going to ask you to leave a review for this course.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,910
Now I know it can be difficult to judge the quality and value of course this already on home of the

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,210
Demetri's system has simply changed and they're asking you to leave your views earlier and earlier in

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:40,950
the course.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,030
No we're not going to ask you to leave a five star review here but what I would like to ask is that

14
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:51,880
if you don't know the course well enough you're not familiar with totals well enough to rate a five

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,630
star course.

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,910
Then please scroll through the different topics that we cover and have a look at all the exciting things

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:58,540
that you will or

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,680
and hopefully once you see that that will give you the confidence to write this course the Passaro course.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,130
If on the other hand you feel something is wrong with the course if you are unsatisfied about something.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,940
If you're unhappy about something then please do let us know before you write.

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,790
Of course you can contact the produce and support team directly or you can leave a short message in

22
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,280
the course Q&amp;A.

23
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,790
And if your book is very valuable to us we'll get back to you or we'll fix up whatever the issue is

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,400
