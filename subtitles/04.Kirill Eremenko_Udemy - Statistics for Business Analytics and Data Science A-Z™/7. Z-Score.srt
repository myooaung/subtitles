00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,760
Hello and welcome back to a course in statistics.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,800
Have you ever heard the term normalize.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,050
Let's normalize this data set.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,900
What does that even mean.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,980
Well today you'll find out that and much much more.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,490
So let's get started here.

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,420
We're talking about does that score.

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,530
All right so this is our normal distribution.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,730
And as we've discussed previously there's our center or the mean right now it's zero.

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,260
Then we've got the standard deviations going either way.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,720
And within the first standard deviation left and right you will always have in a normal distribution

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,940
you will always have sixty eight point two percent of your observation so that's how many observations

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,990
are going to fall between minus 1 center mission and a plus months and duration then within the next

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,470
two.

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:58,260
So if you take the total of minus two standard deviations to Tucson which has been in this area you

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,510
will always get ninety five point four percent of your observations and then between ministries and

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,360
missions these penetrations you will get pretty much all of them you'll get ninety nine point eight

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,810
percent of are observations falling inside.

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,550
Three three sandwiches or three.

20
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,300
Either way minus three two plus three.

21
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,210
That's that's really interesting.

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:27,720
But what if I want to find out how many observations will fall into for instance one and a half a standard

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,520
deviation is just no reason.

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,460
We're just curious what will happen if we look at one and a half and deviations or two and a half or

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,540
half a standard deviation.

26
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,690
How many observations will fall into that part of the normal distribution.

27
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,600
And this is where the Zed's score comes in and it's also called the standard score and also is called

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,930
sometimes the normal score.

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,110
Let's have a look at that.

30
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,990
So let's get rid of all of those writings on our standard deviation and more will let's put it at not

31
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,130
at a non-zero mean.

32
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,390
So it's sitting somewhere at a myu.

33
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:07,680
That's the mean it's not centered around 0 percent or on some other value and it will have a standard

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,440
deviation of Sigma.

35
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,530
So just a very general kind of normal distribution.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,900
And now let's have a look at that's one place that we were interested in.

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,400
So let's say for instance that's about 1.6.

38
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,900
We're interested in 1.6 standard deviations.

39
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,210
How many observations are going to fall into this part over here.

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,530
And that's going to mark that as x.

41
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,710
So what we need to do is we need to calculate the distance First of all first.

42
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,290
Well the point here is we need to get to the score.

43
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,560
And so how we're going to introduce it.

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:45,690
We need to first calculate the distance from the center to X and that's done through just you just check

45
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,290
this line.

46
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,740
So basically that's a representation of that.

47
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,770
And there it is X minus mue that's going to be our distance.

48
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,700
If you just subtract one from the other you'll get the difference and bear in mind that this is a side

49
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,190
difference so if you're x's on the left it'll still be X minus MU and will be negative.

50
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,350
So the distance this way is negative that this was this way is positive that's very important as well.

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:13,860
And the zent score is defined as X minus myu divided by Sigma and that is essentially how many standard

52
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,880
deviations a mile away.

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,090
So if that's Sigma that's X minus.

54
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,380
If you divide x my is me by Sigma you will see that it took about 1 second division a ha ok plus about

55
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:31,350
0.6 So one wanted 1.6 are 1.6 standard deviations away from myu that's where X is residing and that's

56
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,760
what that formula is saying.

57
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:39,490
And that also explains the name well not the name not the escort name but the standard score or the

58
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:45,560
normal normal score or name or sometimes are also called these Zad variables it can be called Zed score

59
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:52,290
standard score normal score or it can be called a normal variable normalized variable as well.

60
00:03:52,290 --> 00:04:01,890
So basically what this this kind of relates back to what we said at the start about normalization when

61
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,120
you hear people say Let's normalize this database are not in our database that's different.

62
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,370
Let's normalize this dataset or Let's normalize these values.

63
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,040
That's exactly what they're saying they're saying.

64
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,730
All right so let's find the mean of these values then let's find the standard deviation of these values

65
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,410
of these set of values and let's just subtract X minus mood to put this whole.

66
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,610
When you do that mue because if you put plug myu in here instead of X ules you'll get a zero.

67
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,220
So that basically moves this whole distribution to zero to the mean of zero.

68
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,280
So if you apply that to all of the values and not just to calculate the set score for x you actually

69
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,830
apply to all the values and you'll get.

70
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,520
You'll move this distribution to a mean of 0 and divide Verstand division.

71
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,800
Basically that means that you will raise there in the end you will get a standard deviation of 1 and

72
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,950
so any distribution with a or any normal suspicion with a mean of zero and deviation one is called a

73
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:09,590
normalized standard distribution or normalized it is called normalized because now all of the variables

74
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,590
conform to the to the philosophy that if you take the mean you'll get zero and if you've clicked the

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,010
send additional be one.

76
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,430
And that's that's essentially what does that square you do and furie have a normalized set of variables.

77
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,140
Then the zeds core will just basically.

78
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:29,000
So you'll have zero here you'll have one for standard deviation you have to as citizens score will be

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,220
just your coordinates you won't and you will no longer need subtract because it's already 0.

80
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,490
You will no longer need to divide by Sigma because it's already once so you'll just have to look at

81
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,910
the coordinates and you'll get.

82
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,190
OK 1.6.

83
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,250
In either case it's not normalized.

84
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:49,580
So that's why we calculating X minus MU and Sigma and we can see that visually we can say it's about

85
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,540
one point six standard deviations away.

86
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,820
All right well that's great but how do we now find out what is a probability.

87
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,230
Well we.

88
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:05,720
It is possible and this is how we can do it so we can find the probability of a random variable that

89
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,280
we pick from this distribution of it falling into this shaded area over here on the left.

90
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,280
And how is that done.

91
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,410
Well that is done through a table.

92
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:22,130
Once you have all of these distributions all these Once you have your distribution normalized then you

93
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,830
have the Zed score or you just calculate the zero score you can go and you can find a table basically

94
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,310
just go to Google and if you look for Zed's score table this is the first one that pops up this sounds

95
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,160
pretty good.

96
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,330
So university of Florida I believe.

97
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,470
Thank you very much and for sharing this on the Internet.

98
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,590
So here if you scroll down you'll see what exactly that saying it's saying.

99
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,000
OK so where does that score if that's your score over here on the left because it's negative.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,300
You can see these negatives scores then.

101
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,810
This is the stable We'll tell you the probability of something being here.

102
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,790
If your score is positive like here you'll see that this table will tell you of the possibility of it

103
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,420
being in that whole area.

104
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,340
So that's fine as score I at core as I remember was about approximately 1.6.

105
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,160
So let's do that.

106
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,770
So there's one 1.6 and then this is the next digit So 1.6 this is your first two digits all the digit

107
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,210
before the column or the digit after the comma after the decimal.

108
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,560
And then you add 1.6 and then you 1 0 0 so you don't want another any more digits.

109
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,590
Although if you are in one point sixty one that's then that's your entry.

110
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,090
You win one point sixty two that's your entry 1.6 that's your entry.

111
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,970
So zero point nine four or five.

112
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,890
OK so that is the probability.

113
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,380
94 percent is a probability that a variable is going to fall 94 percent in the ninety four point ninety

114
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,670
four and a half percent is the probability the variable will fall in this area over here which is looks

115
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,220
plausible just by looking at and looking at the size here.

116
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:04,380
But if we want this area over here between the center and this then we need to subtract how much.

117
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,800
I'll let you I'll let you guess this one.

118
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,550
How much do we need to subtract from.

119
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,700
So this is 94 and a half percent.

120
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,560
How much is this part on the left of the center.

121
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,710
Oh that's right it's 50 percent so we just need to subtract 50 percent.

122
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:22,970
So 94 and a half minus 50 makes it 44 and a half cents is 44 and a half percent probability that you

123
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:29,750
will pick a variable between the center and 1.6 standard deviations to the right or in our case between

124
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:37,990
the mean and X whenever x may have been in the original data set before we calculate that score.

125
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,690
So there we go.

126
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,130
That's that's how it works and that's how you get those percentages.

127
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,660
You might be wondering yourself why do we even need to do this.

128
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,940
But all of this will become much clearer in the next tutorial when we will.

129
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,950
We're going to be starting to apply the central limit theorem.

130
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,010
In practice definitely we're going to need this knowledge.

131
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,280
And so here just the notes on these ninety four point five percent that's going to happen here is going

132
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,360
to be picked from here.

133
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,630
And also that actually means that there's going to be five point five percent there's going to be pick

134
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,220
from here.

135
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:16,960
And as a training exercise before the next Tauriel I highly encourage you to double check these values

136
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,030
so just go to the table and find out what's there.

137
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,870
Just verify that this probability is correct.

138
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,400
What is the probability of picking a random variable between 0 and 1 sigma.

139
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,610
So check if you will get thirty four point one percent.

140
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,660
You're going to have to need to do the same process.

141
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,430
You're going to need to take this side subtract 50 percent and see what you get.

142
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:42,010
Or check one of these and see what you get for the left side of things.

143
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,820
And on that belt top your prejudice Tauriel and I will see you on the next one.

144
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,560
Until then happy analyzing.
