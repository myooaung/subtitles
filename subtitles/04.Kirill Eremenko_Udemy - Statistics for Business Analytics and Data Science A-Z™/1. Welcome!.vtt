Hello my name is curial or Manco.

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.190
And welcome to the statistics for business analytics.

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.100
Is that core is

4
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.750
so what's this course all about.

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.820
Well statistics can be a daunting topic to even consider let alone learn or relearn.

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.890
And that's why I decided to put this course together for you for those people who are business analysts

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.040
or data scientists and need a refresher on statistics because the statistics in a business setting is

8
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.310
very important.

9
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.670
It's a skill that is highly under-rated so not many business analyst or data scientists actually actively

10
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.490
apply it in their work but it totally should be because of things like statistical significance and

11
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.880
confidence in your findings.

12
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.140
What's the point of reporting results if you're not confident in those results and how can you make

13
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.160
business decisions or results which are not statistically reliable.

14
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.670
That's why in this course we're going to discuss a lot of things that are specifically applicable in

15
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.960
a business setting when you talk about distributions.

16
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.050
The central limit theorem.

17
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.890
Hypothesis Testing statistical significance confidence intervals and much much more.

18
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.710
This will allow you to take all that knowledge away and apply it in your role in your career.

19
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.580
And moreover this course is made in a very very fun way.

20
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.880
We've got a lot of examples so it's very practical it's just boring theory.

21
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.790
We're actually going through practical examples all the time and they're all tailored to the real world

22
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.860
to the business world these are real challenges that come up in the real world so you get to see how

23
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.970
the ads can actually be applied.

24
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.390
Plus you can always ask any statistical questions that come up as you're going through the materials

25
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.210
and will be there to help you out.

26
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.950
