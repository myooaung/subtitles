00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.900
Helen will come back to the course on statistics for analytics.

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.020
So previously we left off here.

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.970
And by the way we're still we're solving the challenge for Section 1.

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.010
We're talking about the boutique close high end boutique clothes store and the line of clothes are creating

5
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.880
for very tall people.

6
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.360
We create these traditions.

7
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:27.630
The one we sold the challenge a long time ago we found ourselves over here then we've created distributions

8
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.580
for men and women.

9
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.870
The only thing that we're now doing extra is recreating the charts so we create a child.

10
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.420
But the problem here is that when a date.

11
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.420
So if we just go into any cell click enter these random values update the charts don't update and we

12
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.930
don't like that.

13
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.400
We want to we want to have the charts of data as well.

14
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.140
So let's go ahead and find a way to do that I'm going to delete this.

15
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.060
I'm going to delete this as well.

16
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.930
Because we don't need that.

17
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.970
And I just want to get rid of that formatting here so for my pain or pain this way.

18
00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.570
Area.

19
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.200
So we have bins man women.

20
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.630
So let's deal with men for now.

21
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.570
We're going to say here we're going to say men like just a quick way of putting them into these bins

22
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.440
is understand like you we need frequency function and in order to use a frequency function these have

23
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.660
to already be in this form and so we need to put them in the bins.

24
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.560
We can see that the bins are 50 51 So they're basically every inch is and you've been going around disvalue

25
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.300
here so kind of like a quick shortcut.

26
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.660
You'd have to be creative every time like if it was something else like 50 to 60 to 70 and so on then

27
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.840
you would have to find a way to put them put these values into those bits so let's see which B-M each

28
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.970
one of the values goes into.

29
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.670
So we're going to say around that zero digits.

30
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.230
There you go.

31
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.480
So it's rounding like it's rounding it up.

32
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.210
Right.

33
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.120
Or what is it doing this rounding up when like that seventy two point one or down.

34
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.000
So it's just basically around and I think that's fair up or down doesn't matter as long as it's like

35
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.470
below 0.5.

36
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.030
Then it's down above and up.

37
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.760
So that's the rounded values.

38
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.330
Now we want to split them out by Binz.

39
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.700
So we already have the being's values So maybe let's add some some order here.

40
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.230
So we have the beans values that.

41
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.720
And then we have men men rounded for men we want.

42
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.170
Probably the better way then is if we take this I'm going to cut this and put this in here a bit of

43
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.310
creative approach.

44
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.210
So we have men men right now we have the beans.

45
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.180
Now we're going to split these into bins and this is the tricky part.

46
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.020
We're going to move this away so that it's not so that we folks focus on this part of the chart or of

47
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.300
Excel So here we're going to say free and see where you have the bins there.

48
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.530
There are no beans.

49
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.850
Now we want to see how often we see this value in this column.

50
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.230
So this column is really pretty much not going to be used except for that's where the randomness comes

51
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.160
comes from.

52
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.660
So now we want to see how frequent each one of these values is inside this call and to do that we're

53
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.530
going to have a frequency function.

54
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.510
The challenging part here is that it's an airy function and I don't use houri functions that often and

55
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.800
you need them very rarely.

56
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.340
They're very special type of function and you'll see just now.

57
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.920
So if you haven't used these before don't worry it just is just a way to be able to into this cell because

58
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.270
basically what we need to do is we need to calculate the frequency of from here across these viruses

59
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.740
is a lot of it's just like this plus this or something it's across a whole array and then across a whole

60
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.340
array here.

61
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.110
So that's where Indian art functions.

62
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.920
I'll show you how to create one frequency.

63
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:52.490
Then here you say the data array is is these guys consulship down and just go back up comma and in the

64
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.720
bins array since this one will down and then you close the bracket.

65
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.480
But now I'm just going to copy this so I don't lose it.

66
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.750
Now if I if I'm here and I just press enter nothing will happen and I could just copy this down and

67
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.630
it will all be zeros.

68
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.440
What do you need to and just pay attention to this formula here what you need to do is go in so I clicked

69
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.100
have to worry just double click and you need to not just press enter each press QUANTRILL shift center.

70
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.630
And now look at that.

71
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.570
Now it has.

72
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:23.920
If you click on it nothing.

73
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.140
But if you look at it like that what just happened is that again so Press Control shift center.

74
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.700
If you look at it like that you can see that it's got these curly braces around it and that means it's

75
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.740
in every form.

76
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.420
So I'm not going to go into detail on what an airy formula does but which is going to leverage its power

77
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.190
here so we going to copy that.

78
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.380
Then I'm going to delete this because otherwise we're going to have a bit of trouble.

79
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.120
And now what we want to do is we want to start from here.

80
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.900
Press shift go all the way and then type in the value and then press control shift to enter while the

81
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.670
whole the whole thing is selected and then click OK.

82
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.610
There we go.

83
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.620
So now we have values.

84
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.790
Now you can see now it's work and I can see every single cell has got the array.

85
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.970
And so they're kind of all like working together.

86
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.260
So again the following to a lot of detail you can see that we've got our distribution and it looks like

87
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.640
a normal distribution is because of the width of these numbers you can see that the most frequent value

88
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.410
69 which is Amin which is good.

89
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.180
So there's a frequency.

90
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.190
There's Sabean's.

91
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.430
Now we just need to do the same thing here for women.

92
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.410
So we have that's what I want to do.

93
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.770
I want to do same thing.

94
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.300
That's good.

95
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:46.760
So here we can just copy this value this formula down consulship to our answer.

96
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.660
OK.

97
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.960
Bin's because we just need to copy the beans.

98
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.810
Is it just Constans.

99
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.080
I like a specific beans that work for both men and women and frequency.

100
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.200
So now we going to do something similar to make sure not to change the formula there.

101
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:13.420
So we wanted frequency not H-2 to 1001 but we want these the frequency of these good.

102
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.100
And then I scroll back up.

103
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.410
We want this part to be the bins these ones over here.

104
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.410
Good.

105
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.120
And so good to copy that just in case.

106
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.130
Good that I copied it.

107
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.450
OK.

108
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.760
So I'm going to go there put the value in and press control shift and throughout the whole of this column

109
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.690
The selected.

110
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.260
And there we go.

111
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.540
So those are all values.

112
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.650
And so now you see if I click somewhere and I'm click you can see that everything updates not just this

113
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.390
but everything.

114
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.250
So now let's make it a bit.

115
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.880
I need her to make.

116
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:56.870
Like that's it like that we're like this Marsico scroll very far.

117
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.410
So that's OK.

118
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.300
And then I just want to do what's so good one more borders.

119
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:11.450
I know it's a bit tedious but while this is you know data preparation for you as you know in data science

120
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.070
it's the main thing that takes most of time most time.

121
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.360
So that's exactly what we're doing.

122
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:29.240
We're making it look great on Roamer and so we want that's that that's that that that's all we want.

123
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.110
And probably like put a split here.

124
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.040
Or just to be very pedantic put a split here.

125
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.630
OK.

126
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.990
Which one did I want to do.

127
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.560
When did you do the last one.

128
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.520
And and one more thing we've done.

129
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:51.950
OK.

130
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:52.760
There we go.

131
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.840
So we got men and women here and now we want to just draw the shots.

132
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.260
That's what makes space.

133
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:08.770
All right so we select frequency up to their inserts and scroll up.

134
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:15.240
So what do you want when one of these was beautiful and now we're going to just adjust that.

135
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.900
So like data and.

136
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.560
So here what do you want.

137
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.040
Name is going to be men men.

138
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.190
OK.

139
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.600
And then we're going to add another one.

140
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:32.850
It's going to be women and we're going to select frequency from here.

141
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.570
OK.

142
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:40.370
And then probably one more thing we need to do is so that looks OK that looks good but doesn't have

143
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.590
the heights so we need to change that as well.

144
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:49.770
Adam Saag data edit this access label range Sabean's are the same for both.

145
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.240
Which is great.

146
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.590
So I like that.

147
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.390
OK.

148
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:54.820
All right.

149
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.810
So there we go.

150
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.960
That's our Excel chart.

151
00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.720
Boy.

152
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:05.130
And now quickly format's this thing where it is what I want to for my I think it's.

153
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.020
No no not that for my data series.

154
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.740
There you go.

155
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:16.340
So put this to gap with 2 0 and then put this to zero as well look much better like that.

156
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.100
There you go.

157
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.850
And now we can just put it somewhere here it looks nice.

158
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.580
Lovably What does it non-shared legends.

159
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.940
Well anyway we can fix that up later if we need to.

160
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:36.280
It's pretty we know what's going on so we know it would be pretty cool to have the legends surprise

161
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.750
the legends in on here.

162
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:44.710
But anyway we know just from the way we've built it that men are blue and women are orange.

163
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:49.740
So now if I just click anywhere or if I just press control as to save the spreadsheet you'll see it

164
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.820
updates every time.

165
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.310
So you can see that the distributions are updating.

166
00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.650
So you basically like your sampling you're sampling your literature or not updating incorrect term.

167
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.320
What's updating is a sample.

168
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.350
So the distribution is fixed.

169
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.740
There you go.

170
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.860
That's that's your parameters of a distribution what you're updating is.

171
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:09.610
Remember these.

172
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.070
This is coming from these right.

173
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.050
So this is relying on these values.

174
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:21.370
So you're updating your sample sample of 1000 is being updated every time you press control S and as

175
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:27.340
you can see this one is always centered around sixty three point seven this one centered around sixty

176
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.640
nine point one.

177
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:37.060
And you have some variance and also some you know normally like this time you know the mail distribution

178
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.050
is even told in the future.

179
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.940
Well that's kind of like a sampling thing.

180
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:45.920
That's what's a sampling error is that that you just because of where you take a sample.

181
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.980
It's going to be a bit to the left orbit to the right every time is going to be different so generally

182
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.330
because we know that the standard deviation for the men distribution is higher.

183
00:10:55.390 --> 00:11:00.700
That means that this blue distribution is going to be whiter and shorter and there aren't distribution

184
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.470
is going to be because this penetration is low is going to be narrower and taller but it's not always

185
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:10.270
the case as we can see sometimes just because of the sampling you know the distribution is going to

186
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.000
be that that's going to be the case for the distribution always.

187
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:19.180
But for the samples you can see that sometimes this sample is just the way it's sampled because of the

188
00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.330
sampling error.

189
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:21.500
It happens to be.

190
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.690
While this time it's a bit taller than this one.

191
00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:29.780
And again and then another about the same height and distance Stoler.

192
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.510
And this one's taller.

193
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.670
So this is critical I think.

194
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.140
Could you just sit here for a few hours and play around like that.

195
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.590
Do you do you.

196
00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:46.870
I always feel you know like some kind of accomplishment when you've created something like this which

197
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:52.460
is you know like totally our creation we created this all from scratch.

198
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.690
This is so-call.

199
00:11:54.070 --> 00:12:01.690
Anyway I hope you were able to follow along and I think for sticking around can means you're very dedicated

200
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.120
and curious really respect that.

201
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:12.790
And yeah hopefully now this clarifies or give you some opportunities to practice a bit more with a distribution's

202
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:19.270
And if you've never worked with them before you now know a bit more and how they work and what samples

203
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.320
are what the mean is what the standard deviation is.

204
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.650
And now we're ready to proceed with the rest of the course.

205
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.730
And I look for see you there.

206
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.680
Until next I'm happy analyzing.
