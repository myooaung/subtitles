00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:05,075
Welcome at the end of this module.

2
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:09,451
You have considerably expanded your knowledge of JAXB in this

3
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,528
module by learning about the schema-first approach.

4
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:16,589
We started by comparing the code-first and the schema-first

5
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:20,353
approach and looking at what the advantages and

6
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,720
disadvantages of both approaches are.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,358
Then you've learned how to work with the schema-first approach

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:30,276
in practice by using the xjc tool and taking a look at how you

9
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:32,627
can work with the generated classes.

10
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:35,488
In the second half of the module,

11
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:40,755
you've learned a lot about customizing how xjc should generate classes from

12
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:46,000
an XSD by writing binding files to control what xjc does.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,064
We've looked at many different possible things that you can customize,

14
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:54,657
for example, how to customize the names of generated classes and fields,

15
00:00:54,657 --> 00:00:59,584
how to map a complex type to a class that you wrote yourself,

16
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:01,872
how to map a simple type to a class,

17
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:05,936
and how you can avoid having fields of type JAXBElement generated.

18
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:10,632
You've also learned how to automatically generate an adapter class by

19
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:16,621
looking at how you can map a dateTime attribute to a java.

20
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:17,259
time.

21
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:18,536
OffsetDateTime object.

22
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:18,892
Finally,

23
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:22,456
you've learned how you can customize how simple types with

24
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:26,776
enumeration facets are mapped to Java enum types.

25
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:29,591
Congratulations on making it this far.

26
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:35,798
You now already know enough to work with JAXB effectively with both

27
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:39,188
the code-first and the schema-first approach.

28
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:43,563
There are still a number of interesting things to learn.

29
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:49,688
In the next module, we'll take a look at a number of more advanced use cases.

30
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:52,436
It's useful to know about these subjects because when

31
00:01:52,436 --> 00:02:01,000
you're going to work with JAXB in practice, you'll undoubtedly encounter some of these cases in your work.
