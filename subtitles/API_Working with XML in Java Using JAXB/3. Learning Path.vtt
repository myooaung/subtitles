00:00:01.871 --> 00:00:06.558
Let's take a look at what I assume you already know and where this course about

2
00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:11.605
JAXB fits in with other courses available on Pluralsight.

3
00:00:11.605 --> 00:00:12.486
For this course,

4
00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:17.198
I assume that you already know how to program in Java and that you have

5
00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:20.159
the Java Development Kit installed on your system.

6
00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:22.040
If you're really new to Java,

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.399
then I recommend that you make sure you're familiar with Java

8
00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.187
syntax and writing small programs yourself first.

9
00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:32.721
There are many courses available on Pluralsight from which

10
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:35.574
you can learn the fundamentals of Java.

11
00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:39.562
Besides the JDK, you don't need any other tools,

12
00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:41.909
but I recommend using an IDE,

13
00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.024
which will make working with the examples much easier.

14
00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:52.246
I will be using IntelliJ IDEA, but you're free to use any other IDE,

15
00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:54.222
such as Eclipse or NetBeans.

16
00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:58.865
All the examples in this course will use either Maven or Gradle,

17
00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:02.348
So as long as your IDE supports these build tools,

18
00:01:02.348 --> 00:01:05.978
you will to import the example code into your IDE.

19
00:01:05.978 --> 00:01:09.161
I also assume that you have, at least,

20
00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:12.945
some basic knowledge about XML and XML schema.

21
00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:14.304
To refresh your knowledge,

22
00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:18.627
I've included a short overview of the most important concepts you need

23
00:01:18.627 --> 00:01:23.440
to know about XML and XSD at the end of this module.

24
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.327
If you've never worked with XML before,

25
00:01:25.327 --> 00:01:29.826
then you might want to take a look at the following other

26
00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:35.432
Pluralsight courses: XML Fundamentals by Dan Sullivan and XML

27
00:01:35.432 --> 00:01:39.178
Syntax Fundamentals by Ken Holman.

28
00:01:39.178 --> 00:01:44.115
If you're specifically interested in working XML-based web services,

29
00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:58.000
then the following course might be interesting to follow after this course: Building JAX-WS Web Services with Apache CXF by Michael Hoffman.
