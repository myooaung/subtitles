1
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:08,612
Now we will, of course, take a look at unmarshalling XML back into Java objects.

2
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:16,344
Please open the example ps-jaxb-03-unmarshalling to follow along.

3
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:21,049
In the src, main, resources directory, there is an XML file, purchaseOrder.

4
00:00:21,049 --> 00:00:27,044
xml, which contains the XML document from the marshalling demo.

5
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:31,950
Let's see how we can unmarshal that into a purchaseOrder object.

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,538
The first class to look at is class UnmarshallingExample1.

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:42,962
As you know, the first thing you need to do is create a JAXBContext.

8
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:47,432
Then we create an Unmarshaller object by calling

9
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:49,667
createUnmarshaller on the context.

10
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:53,813
Then we call the Unmarshal method to read the XML file,

11
00:00:53,813 --> 00:01:00,094
which returns a JAXBElement that contains the purchaseOrder object.

12
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:03,437
Just like with the Marshal method of class Marshaller,

13
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:07,304
there are actually different overloaded versions of the Unmarshal

14
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:11,282
method that read from different kinds of inputs.

15
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:14,658
Class StreamSource, which I use here for convenience,

16
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,881
is actually from the XML transformation API.

17
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:22,040
There are also versions of the Unmarshal method that,

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,839
for example, read from a DOM Node or a StAX XMLStreamReader or XMLEventReader.

19
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:34,576
Let's quickly look at the second unmarshalling example,

20
00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:37,066
class UnmarshallingExample2.

21
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:42,116
This example shows you how you can unmarshal from a DOM node.

22
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:47,514
In this example, we read the XML using the DOM API.

23
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:50,811
To do that, we need to create a DocumentBuilder,

24
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:54,548
which parses the XML file into a Document object.

25
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:59,755
We can then unmarshal the rootElement of the document by calling

26
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:03,812
the Unmarshal method that takes a DOM node.

27
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:05,405
That's it for now.

28
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:08,597
Please play with the marshalling and unmarshalling examples

29
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:13,440
yourself so that you get a good grip on how it works.

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:23,000
Consult the API documentation if you want to know the exact details of what the JAXB method should do.
