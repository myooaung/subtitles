1
00:00:02,023 --> 00:00:03,058
In this module,

2
00:00:03,058 --> 00:00:06,162
you've learned how you can integrate the JAXB tools

3
00:00:06,162 --> 00:00:09,078
into your Maven or Gradle build.

4
00:00:09,078 --> 00:00:11,994
We first looked at Maven builds.

5
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:18,411
In the first Maven example, we've used the jaxb2-maven-plugin to call schemagen,

6
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:24,980
and in the second example, we've used the same plugin to call xjc.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,072
Second, we've looked at gradle build.

8
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:34,051
In the two Gradle examples, we did the same thing as in the Maven examples.

9
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,598
First, we've used the jaxb.

10
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:41,482
schemaGen task provided by a Gradle plugin to call schemagen,

11
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:44,557
and then we have used the jaxb.

12
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:48,695
javaGen task from the same plugin to call xjc.

13
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:54,359
The examples in this module were small and just meant to give you a starting

14
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,075
point for configuring your own builds in your own projects.

15
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:03,612
You can find more information on both the Maven and Gradle plugins

16
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:07,468
on the web pages for the respective plugins.

17
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:11,439
I recommend that you look at the examples at your own pace and

18
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,201
study the documentation of the plugins to see what the best way

19
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:18,456
is to use them for your own projects.

20
00:01:18,456 --> 00:01:19,382
With this,

21
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:24,755
you now know everything you need to know to be able to

22
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:27,378
use JAXB in real-world Java projects.

23
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,505
In the next module,

24
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,923
we'll be looking at a subject that is a stepping stone

25
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:36,137
for what might come after this course.

26
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,016
JAXB can be used for many different purposes,

27
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:51,000
and one application where it's often used is for XML-based web services. That's what we'll take a look at in the final module of this course.
