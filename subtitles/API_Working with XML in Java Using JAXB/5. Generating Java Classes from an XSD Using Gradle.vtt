00:00:02.079 --> 00:00:03.460
To make the examples complete,

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.373
we'll take a look at how you can call xjc from a Gradle build.

3
00:00:09.373 --> 00:00:11.916
Just like in the previous examples,

4
00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:16.937
this is not very complicated; you just need to have an idea of

5
00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:19.838
how to configure the plugin to call xjc.

6
00:00:19.838 --> 00:00:27.959
Let's take a look at example ps-jaxb-33-gradle-xjc.

7
00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:32.780
In this example, we are using the same Gradle plugin as in the previous example,

8
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.422
but this time, we are using the jaxb.

9
00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:40.708
javaGen task instead of the jaxb.

10
00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:41.771
schemaGen task.

11
00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:47.667
Of course, the configuration of this task is also slightly different.

12
00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:50.906
We are setting three properties here.

13
00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:51.250
First,

14
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.441
the schema and binding properties to point the plugin to the XSD

15
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:59.074
and the bindings file that we want to process,

16
00:00:59.074 --> 00:01:03.086
and then the packageName property to set the name of the package

17
00:01:03.086 --> 00:01:06.677
that we want the generated classes to be in.

18
00:01:06.677 --> 00:01:09.492
Just like in the previous example,

19
00:01:09.492 --> 00:01:15.518
we make the JavaCompile task depend on the jaxb task so that the jaxb.

20
00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:21.006
javaGen task is executed before the JavaCompile task.

21
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:26.504
We can now open a terminal again and run gradle clean build.

22
00:01:26.504 --> 00:01:30.302
The generated classes are written to the directory

23
00:01:30.302 --> 00:01:40.552
build/generated/jaxb/java/example and are included by the javaCompile task.

24
00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:43.514
When we look at what's inside the JAR file that has been

25
00:01:43.514 --> 00:01:48.661
written to the build\libs directory, we see that everything is there,

26
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:57.000
including the class files that were compiled from the source files generated by xjc.
