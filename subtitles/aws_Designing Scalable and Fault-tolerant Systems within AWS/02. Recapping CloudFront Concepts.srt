00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,840
[Autogenerated] Okay, let's begin discussing CLOUDFRONT.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,040
Now.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,650
For those who don't know, let's have a quick review.

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:12,220
Cloudfront is a global cdn offered by a ws for delivering

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,190
content faster via regional edge locations.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,930
So it works together with our origins,

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,770
which will see here in a little bit to deliver

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,740
content at a faster rate via cashing.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,000
Another neat factor is that it integrates with Route

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,960
53 seamlessly so we can use D.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,840
N s resolution globally to hit our cloudfront distributions.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,760
And then it also offers different cashing behaviors

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,480
and types such as Web in our MTP,

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,340
depending on the use case for your particular origin that you need,

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,630
and we'll look at both of these here in the upcoming clips.

16
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,900
Now let's go ahead and discuss cloudfront edge locations.

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,340
Now the back end of Cloudfront is what's called origins.

18
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,300
So origins are the content that we're trying to serve up to our

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,830
cdn that we have in place for people to hit.

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,620
You can see we have examples here on the right of a V B C with

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,530
a load balancer in some E c two instances,

22
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,640
and that's a single origin,

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,210
or we can even have a simple origin of a static site with an S three

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,740
bucket that holds contents for the clients to pull down.

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:25,910
Now,

26
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,940
another key factor here is that CLOUDFRONT is made up of

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,590
those edge locations that we talked about.

28
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,570
And these edge locations pictured here are going to allow

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,030
us to cash content locally in a location that's closer to

30
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,440
the client making the request.

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,320
So, for instance,

32
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,580
thehe mia applying here on the left up top is making a call to some D.

33
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,940
N s name.

34
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,840
It redirects them seamlessly to the nearest edge location,

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,720
and then they hit are streaming distribution that we have

36
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,540
with our ale B and E C two instances.

37
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,100
Now, if that bottom client made the same call,

38
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,840
it would hit the edge location that we see here.

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,710
And in this example, it's hitting a download distribution,

40
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,980
which we'll talk about, and it's just pulling that static site and contents.

41
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,160
But each of these edge locations are geographically close

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,650
to the client that's making the request.

43
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,940
It speeds up any cashing processing that needs to be done.

44
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,690
Now the A pack client on the bottom could also hit this streaming distribution

45
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,360
up top it would just go through a different edge location,

46
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,540
the one we see down here at the bottom.

47
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,680
So it would make it request to the same D.

48
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,590
N s.

49
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,870
Except for this time after the edge.

50
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,200
It would point it to our streaming distribution and hit that origin.

51
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,340
So there's a lot of configurations that go on here.

52
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,020
And don't worry,

53
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,290
we'll go ahead and walk through setting these up here in the upcoming clips.

54
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,940
I just want to give you a general overview of the

55
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,420
infrastructure and how it's architected.

56
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,240
Now, the next big use cases cloudfront restrictive access.

57
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,960
So this is a common scenario on exams within a W s where you

58
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,080
might be asked to go ahead and lock down access toe s three

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,140
buckets via cloudfront on Lee.

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,870
Now, this allows for several security benefits,

61
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,440
such as signed your l's and authenticated requests.

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,060
And what you do is you define an origin access identity, also known as an O A.

63
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,940
I.

64
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,740
And you assign that away i to a cloudfront distribution that is

65
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,630
permitted access to access s three objects.

66
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:40,110
So the permissions on the S three bucket are allowing on Lee this.

67
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,040
Oh aye, Aye, over here in the middle to access the objects in the bucket.

68
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,650
So if we have a client trained, directly access the S three objects,

69
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,680
it gets tonight because it's not coming through our cloudfront

70
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,110
distribution in our origin access identity.

71
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,400
Now let's go ahead and move on to some demos.

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,790
Now the first thing we're going to do is we're going to

73
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,340
create a cloudfront distribution.

74
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,410
We need to see how it works and what we need to do at a

75
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,020
bare minimum to get this stood up.

76
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,710
And then we'll look at setting up an origin access identity

77
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,440
for restricting s3 access to cloudfront.

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,540
We'll even look at some signed your l's as well as we go through there.

79
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,260
So let's go ahead,

80
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,520
will end here and then in the next clip will pick up in

81
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,000
the Consul and we'll start playing around with Cloudfront so we can see how it works.
