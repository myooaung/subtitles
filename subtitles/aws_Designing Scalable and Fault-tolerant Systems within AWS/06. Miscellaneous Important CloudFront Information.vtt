00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.130
[Autogenerated] All right, so last clip in this series of cloudfront clips,

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.850
this one's gonna be short and sweet,

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.490
but I just wanted to show you some of the restrictions we can put in place.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.460
So what I can do here is Aiken set a geo restriction

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.630
based on a few different things.

6
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.620
We can white list locations from a list provided or

7
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.140
weaken blacklist from a list provided.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.010
So if you want a black less from, say, Albania,

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.910
you can add that to the black list and then any requests from that

10
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.020
origin country or that source country will get denied struggle and

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.570
remove this because I don't want a blacklist anyone.

12
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.300
But this is how you can quickly deny any request to

13
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.700
cloudfront based on the country of origin.

14
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.370
So I'm gonna go ahead and cancel out.

15
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.930
I just wanted to quickly show you how you conducive that toe

16
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.040
block your content from different countries.

17
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.260
Now,

18
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.710
one last thing I wanted to show you is you can view your origin

19
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.220
access identities within this cloudfront dashboard so I can go

20
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.880
ahead and edit this if I want.

21
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.630
But really, all I can do is give it a new comment and I have it blurred out.

22
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050
It also provides an I D,

23
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.310
which is what is used for that restricting viewer access to s three.

24
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.250
So that bucket policy that allowed our cloudfront domain distribution

25
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.420
to go ahead and access objects in the back end.

26
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.820
It's translating to this canticle I d.

27
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.490
Right here.

28
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.190
And that's how that works.

29
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.720
Now that'll go ahead and do it.

30
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.340
Like I said, it was a short and sweet clip,

31
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.030
but I just wanted to show you a few of the tidbits that

32
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.000
are kind of hidden within Cloudfront. So let's go ahead and wrap here and then move on to Route 53.
