00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,180
[Autogenerated] all right, way to go.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,720
You've made it through the second module of this

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,490
plural site course Before we end.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,500
Let's just have a quick review and wrap up of what we learned Now.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,740
We had in depth exploration of auto Skilling groups and the components that

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,940
make them up like launch can figs and launch templates.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,320
We passed in user data toe automate some simple

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,640
installs four auto Skilling groups.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,620
And then we placed an auto scaling group behind an application

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,960
load balancer to demo how routing that external traffic works in

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,700
a multi ese auto scaling system.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,940
So all of this built on the previous module of a stateless architecture

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,910
by showing how it quick and easy it is to scale in and out when we have a

14
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,040
stateless design that we architect it now,

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,060
we'll go ahead and wrap up here and then in the next module,

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:10,000
will begin looking at using Cloudfront and Route 53 within different advance scenarios.
