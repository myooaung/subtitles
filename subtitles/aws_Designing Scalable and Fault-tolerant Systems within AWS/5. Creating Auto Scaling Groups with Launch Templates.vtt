00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.310
[Autogenerated] Okay, let's pick up with launch templates.

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:04.540
Now.

3
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.940
Launch templates are similar to launch configurations,

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.030
with a few minor improvements that make a pretty big difference,

5
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.740
compared tow launch configurations.

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.930
Now,

7
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.520
the first big plus for using launch templates is

8
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.200
that they support all of the newer, easy to instance types.

9
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.390
So what that means is we have greater flexibility for our images

10
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.040
in our instance types that we want to use.

11
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.610
So let's walk through this process.

12
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.060
Now we can give it a description, and then we can select auto scaling guidance,

13
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.390
which is an option that says, Hey,

14
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.180
I'm going to use this in an auto Skilling group,

15
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.640
So show me what I need to do now.

16
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.610
What that does is it shows you what's required to go

17
00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.240
ahead and create this successfully, so I'll go ahead and select our Am I.

18
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.990
I'll use Amazon Lennox, too,

19
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.300
but you can see we have several images we can pull from.

20
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.440
We go down to our instance type, and if we do this again,

21
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.180
you'll notice that we have all of the newer ec2 instance types,

22
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.300
which is a humongous list that says a ton of flexibility in

23
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.240
it now we specify our key pair if we want.

24
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.440
So if we want to log in, we can.

25
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.840
And then we can select if we want VPC or Ec2 Classic.

26
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.610
Now Easy to classic is getting phased out, so VPC is the choice for this.

27
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.300
We specify our security groups.

28
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.740
We can specify storage config if we want.

29
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.340
You see there's a default volume one here.

30
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.300
We can give our instance tags,

31
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.840
and we can add additional interfaces for networking.

32
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.350
Now let's expand advanced and you can see we have a

33
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.210
few advanced options and buy a few.

34
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.490
I mean a lot.

35
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.360
We can request spot instances to save on money,

36
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.040
which we talked about in our first module.

37
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.010
We can add an instance profile so all of our instances will have this.

38
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.930
I am roll attached.

39
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.630
You'll see that with auto scaling selected,

40
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.020
some of the behaviors are not able to be customized.

41
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.470
And here we have some other options that you do not get

42
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.270
from a launch configuration itself.

43
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.720
There's different optimization options, reservations,

44
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.810
tendency, a lot of different customizable pieces that we can do.

45
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.900
You can specify the Ram disk i d the Colonel i d.

46
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.200
There's license config Sze,

47
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.220
there really is an endless amount of customization that you can do now

48
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.140
I'll go ahead and put that same script as before.

49
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.060
I'll create our launch template and there we go.

50
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.180
We have now created it.

51
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.940
So let's view it.

52
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.730
And there it iss We have our launch template all of

53
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.190
our settings that we specified.

54
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.640
And if we wanted to,

55
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.520
we could actually go toe actions here and we can create a

56
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.340
new auto Skilling group for this service.

57
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.510
Now,

58
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.140
what I'm gonna do instead is I'm gonna go to our existing auto scaling group.

59
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.140
I'm gonna edit it.

60
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.490
I'm gonna change our desired capacity toe one and you can see

61
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.640
the top option here is launched template.

62
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.800
So I'll select that and you see our launch template name?

63
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.810
We only have one.

64
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.780
We have our template version, which we'll talk about in a second.

65
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.740
We have our description and then our fleet composition.

66
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.710
If we need it, everything else is pretty much the same.

67
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.740
So we'll click on save and there we go.

68
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.100
So we're now leveraging that launch template instead of our launch.

69
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.300
Come pick Now, The cool thing you might have noticed when we were doing that is,

70
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.940
you can create versions.

71
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.460
So unlike launch configurations,

72
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.840
another major factor is we can create a new version of this template

73
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.840
so we don't have to create a new one each time.

74
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.310
So if I go to actions I can create a new version,

75
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.190
will select provide guidance again, and this time I'm gonna remove our user data.

76
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.000
So nothing occurs.

77
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.720
I'll click, create, and there we go.

78
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.990
We have version, too, as you can see at the top.

79
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.930
So now we can look at our different versions that we created for our

80
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.740
launch templates to use in our auto scaling groups.

81
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.440
Now, launch templates can be used to spin up single instances as well,

82
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.910
but their main use cases, usually for auto Skilling groups.

83
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:16.210
So now, if I go down to auto scaling groups one more time, I edited again.

84
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.130
We specify our launch template version.

85
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.750
You can see we have default.

86
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.440
There's version one.

87
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.240
There's version two, and then there's latest.

88
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.440
So if we want to always use the latest version, we can select that.

89
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.240
You see it's selected version two based on our temple description.

90
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:41.710
I'll go ahead and scale this up one I'll save and then I'll refresh.

91
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.220
Now what I'll do here is all pause.

92
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.990
The clip will let it spin up a new instance,

93
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.910
and then we'll verify that it's using our launch template that we specify.

94
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.260
Okay, there we go.

95
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.910
You can see it's spinning up or new instance,

96
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.340
and that's got our prod Web lt launched template that we just created.

97
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.750
So hopefully this demo shows you the key differences between

98
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.740
leveraging launch configurations in launch templates.

99
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.900
You want to start leaning toward using launch templates

100
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.550
due to their custom is ations as well as their advanced

101
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.590
attributes that you can edit.

102
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.450
So let's go ahead, will break here and in the upcoming clips,

103
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:35.000
we're going to start looking at utilizing a W s load balancers with our auto Skilling groups in a multi availabilities own fashion
