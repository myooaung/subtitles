00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,550
[Autogenerated] Let's dive into this second module,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,570
which is going to focus on implementing Brazilian

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,680
auto Skilling workloads in a W s.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,940
Now in this module, we have a few learning objectives.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,660
We want to understand how we can implement auto scaling

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,140
and multi availabilities own systems.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,160
We want to learn how we can leverage load balancers within a W s.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,020
So we'll look at the application load balancer offering as well as the

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,260
network load balance our offering and we'll explore the differences

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,840
between those in the demos that air coming up.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,530
The last main objective is we want to learn the VPC considerations for

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,140
highly available systems when leveraging auto scaling.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,280
So with that,

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:01:01,000
let's wrap up this intro here and in the next clip will dive in tow. Auto Skilling groups and their use cases.
