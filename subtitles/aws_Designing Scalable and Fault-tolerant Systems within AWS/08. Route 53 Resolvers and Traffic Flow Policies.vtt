00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.470
[Autogenerated] welcome back.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.890
So let's talk about traffic flow now.

3
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.390
I'm not gonna create me policies,

4
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.440
but I just want to give an overview of what this is.

5
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.980
So Rue 53 allows us to define traffic flow policies via a visual

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.240
editor so we can handle how we want our traffic to go.

7
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.800
So what's nice about this is we saw how we can set up

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.300
a primary and secondary fail over, but from with in there,

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.430
you can get even more advanced in complex.

10
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.950
So as you can see in their example,

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.590
we have awaited rule on Lee based on our primary record that we set up.

12
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.860
So it's only going to get waited if our primary is passing in the

13
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.510
traffic and those wait traffic on the back end to our two different

14
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.080
load balancers there in the in points.

15
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.570
Now, if that primary fails, that whole waited traffic flow gets ignored,

16
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.040
and it goes to our secondary endpoint as an s three bucket,

17
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.840
which is similar to what we actually just did.

18
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.260
So This allows you to get far more complex and detailed with

19
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.840
your traffic routing that you need Now.

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.610
There's also policy records and he's just build in by associating

21
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.310
traffic policies with domains or sub domain names.

22
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.440
So that's how you associate these policies with domains.

23
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.340
Now I want to skip down here to resolve er's,

24
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.740
and this is a pretty cool in newer edition.

25
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.900
Now, a roof 53 resolve er is goingto let you route your D.

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.550
N s queries between your VPC and your network.

27
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.030
So what that means is you can have your network traffic

28
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.140
route herbal from your VPC internally.

29
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.320
Now,

30
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.310
this is very neat and it's pretty new because originally

31
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.550
you'd have to set up your own instance.

32
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.900
That kind of four is this D.

33
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.780
N s traffic, as opposed to using an in pointe provided by a W s.

34
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.900
So what you do is you spin up an inbound in point for inbound

35
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.070
traffic and you need outbound in points as well.

36
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.140
So you're going to need at least two in points of fully get this benefit,

37
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.610
So I would just go to create, and then I would walk through my v p c.

38
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.580
A security group that we want for our en pointe.

39
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.780
And then you can specify I P addresses in tags.

40
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.840
Now I'm not going to do this because I don't want to pay for this.

41
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.030
But these air a very critical component of Route 53 now

42
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.140
that they're added So it's pretty neat.

43
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.990
You can see we also have rules so you can create your own

44
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.360
custom rules revolving around your resolve.

45
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.740
Er so there's a rule for outbound traffic,

46
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.810
and you can see that for queries that originate in your BBC,

47
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.950
you can define how to afford those D.

48
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.840
N S queries so you can specify your rule type.

49
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.240
You can specify your domain.

50
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.750
So if we're looking at example dot com,

51
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.740
we want to go ahead and pointed toe 19 to 0 to 10.

52
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.270
We choose the vpc that we want to apply this to in the

53
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.800
outbound in point if we have one created.

54
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.940
So this is saying, Hey,

55
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.530
I want to point any traffic to this domain to this I p address on this port.

56
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.990
So this is gonna look at our 192 local address for domain resolution.

57
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.970
It's a pretty cool thing, So that's gonna go ahead and do it.

58
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.730
I just wanted to cover a few more options that we had in

59
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.080
our Route 53 Service and dashboard.

60
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.100
Let's go ahead and wrap up here,

61
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:34.000
and then we'll go ahead and wrap up this module with a quick review and then eventual next steps.
