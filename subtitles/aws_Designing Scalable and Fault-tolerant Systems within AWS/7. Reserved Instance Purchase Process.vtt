00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.280
[Autogenerated] All right, let's continue on.

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.250
And in this clip,

3
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.320
we're going to start looking at reserved instances now

4
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:13.340
that we've seen both spot in on demand, I want to go to reserved instances.

5
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.800
Now you purchase reserved instances,

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.330
and you'll see with this menu here that you can specify your platform,

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.890
the type of instance that you want your tenancy your term so the term can

8
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.010
be one month to 12 months or 12 months to 36 months.

9
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.810
There's an offering class so convertible,

10
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.620
which means that you can convert between instance types

11
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.140
based on the current market value.

12
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.920
Or there's standard where you can only choose one

13
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.940
instance type for your instance reservation.

14
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.010
We have our payment option so you can do no upfront, partial or all up front.

15
00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.500
Now, no up front will offer the least amount of savings amongst all three.

16
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.050
Partial is the middle and then all up front gives you

17
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.880
the biggest savings in the long run.

18
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.780
And what this is doing is essentially telling a ws that

19
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.160
you're committed to using this compute, and in doing so,

20
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.750
they offer you a steep discount.

21
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.110
Swimming.

22
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.650
Go ahead and search and you'll see we have tons of options.

23
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:31.520
So I can have a 12 month term at a 120.62 rate for no upfront payment with a

24
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.140
standard class or if I want to pay a little bit more here,

25
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.020
I can have a convertible instance,

26
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.840
which offers some flexibility in case I want to change my mind.

27
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.210
Now you'll see that the longer the term you agree to,

28
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.310
the bigger the discount you get.

29
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.750
So three years provides almost a 30.2 difference in

30
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.040
price compared to a one year now.

31
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.070
That doesn't seem like a lot.

32
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.720
But when you're scaling up several hundreds or thousands of instances,

33
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.140
that adds up extremely quickly.

34
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.340
And really, that's with no up front costs.

35
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.110
So if we look at the same 36 months for all upfront on a standard instance type,

36
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.900
you can see it's actually even cheaper 0.38 compared 2.43 So

37
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.120
we're saving even Mawr by paying more up front.

38
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.600
So what I would do here is I would specify the quantity I want.

39
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.430
I would add it to my cart.

40
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.160
I would view my cart and then I would order and what this does is,

41
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.070
it builds your account based on the pricing standpoint you chose,

42
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.030
and it would give us a reserved instance for us to look at for our utilization.

43
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.190
Now,

44
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.080
I'm not going to do that because I don't wanna go ahead and

45
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.340
commit to a reserved instance for my demo account.

46
00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.730
But that's how you Congar oh,

47
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.980
ahead and utilize reserved instances in your own accounts.

48
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.230
Now,

49
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.640
a good use case for reserved instances would be something

50
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.140
long running like maybe a domain controller or some type of

51
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.680
easy to with a sequel server on it,

52
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.740
something you know is going to be living for a very long time.

53
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.770
Now that's gonna go ahead and do it for this demo.

54
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.530
On the different instance, lifecycle types there's on demand.

55
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.000
There's spot.

56
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.680
And then there's reserved instances,

57
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.790
so be sure to read through and play around with all three types,

58
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:44.000
and then we'll go ahead and break here and in the next clip will have a quick module wrap up in review
