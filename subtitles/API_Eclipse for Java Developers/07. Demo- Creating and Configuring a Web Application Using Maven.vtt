00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.860
[Autogenerated] let us now create a second project

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.190
using the Maybourne Pugin for Eclipse.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.870
Once again.

4
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.350
Ah,

5
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.740
let us open the pop up menu of this project Explorer

6
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.090
View New Project Select May Virna.

7
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.870
This is a maven project.

8
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.640
Next, we are going to skip the archetypes that external click.

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.400
Next.

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.630
Let us take all the Komada as the group I d may burn a Web app as the artifact I

11
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.100
d zero that wanna for the version of and for the packaging.

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.020
We're not going to select job this time.

13
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.550
But war,

14
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.380
which stands up for Web archive er and which is the

15
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.230
standard maven packaging for Web applications.

16
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.780
Let us click.

17
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.680
Finish.

18
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.170
The projector is being created and we can see that there

19
00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.330
is an error in it When we open it, there isn't an error in the bomb fighter.

20
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.800
Let us open this bomb, filer.

21
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.790
Let us do some clean up in it.

22
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.580
Let us copy paste the default properties that we saw in a maven module

23
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.920
of this course and let us update this maven project,

24
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.710
maybe Web app to make sure that the libraries are the Java eight libraries and

25
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.890
not the job of five libraries now this a roar is still there.

26
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.270
Letters.

27
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.660
Check the error.

28
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.800
Messager.

29
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.410
Maybourne is in fact complaining because it needs a failing

30
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.840
missing Web XML property that has to be set to true.

31
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.540
So let us do that.

32
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.810
Failure on missing exam Ella lettuce put holes for this property.

33
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.030
And now maven should be happy.

34
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.410
Why do we have to put this?

35
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.200
Because in previews,

36
00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.370
versions of Java e This Web XML meta data filer was mandatory and

37
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.240
it has been made optional in an old version.

38
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.920
But maybe in steel supports this old format.

39
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.200
So we need to tell me even that if this web exam it is not there,

40
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.260
it's still okay.

41
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.850
Now let us check the properties are of this project on

42
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.930
the project facets of this project,

43
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.220
especially on let us go directly to the runtime environment and you

44
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.030
can see that creating a Java E project using the Maven play Gainer

45
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.140
does not configure the runtime automatically.

46
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.950
You have to do that by hand.

47
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.730
So let us click here.

48
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.070
Apache Tomcat Re Naina Java is said to eight, which is finer.

49
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.600
The dynamic Web module is said to to that five and

50
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:56.000
we want three that wanna apply, apply in close. And now we have a proper Java e Web application project created with Megan.
