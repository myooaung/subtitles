1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,680
[Autogenerated] For that.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:08,250
I need to import the J unit package if I am using J Unit once again,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,960
this is done in the properties of this project.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:18,650
So all center wants again build path here under library tub there.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,000
J unit is not present in the workspace,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,840
so it is known as an external jar or external dependency of this project.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,880
There are several ways of toe.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,040
Add it.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,670
The most straightforward way is, in fact,

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:41,370
to add it as a library since Jay and it is already known by Eclipse.

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,140
So all I have to do is click on this J unit dependency here.

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,890
Next, select J Unit four.

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,510
Here.

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,150
Eclipse is telling me that it is using the four the 12 a version of

15
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,440
J Unit four and click the finish button here.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,840
Now, J Unit appears as a dependency of this project.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,610
A play on closer and you see that it has been other

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,810
the as a library to this project,

19
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:17,940
so I can use the well known test sanitation to create dis method.

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,750
Let us call it public avoider should return the allure world.

21
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,730
Messager.

22
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,180
Given that I have the message,

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:35,260
service equals new Mr Surveys when I called message service dot Get me surgery.

24
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,670
Let me put this in a variable using the control magic shortcut of Eclipse,

25
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,710
Miss surgery.

26
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,280
Then I am going to assert be care full user,

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,220
the ____ unit acid class and not the other one.

28
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,520
That the expected message is equal to the message I get from my test.

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm going to create a variable expected er this should be a stranger,

30
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,740
and this should be in the world.

31
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,500
I'm going to put this here.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,400
So this tester is a well from test.

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,790
How can I run it?

34
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,060
Well,

35
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,550
there is a plug in for Eclipse for that directly

36
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,230
from the pop up menu of Eclipse.

37
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:30,000
I can run as a as a J unit test and the JN it's plug in will open automatically the J unit view with my test that has been correctly run
