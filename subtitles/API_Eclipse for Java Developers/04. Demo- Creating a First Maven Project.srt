00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,640
[Autogenerated] let us now see how to create a simple maven project.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,940
We are in the Java Sea perspective.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,340
You can check it out at the top right off this interface.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,720
And we're going to use the package explorer of you here and a pop up menu.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,680
And you project we're going here to select project instead off Java project.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,460
Since what we want to do is to create a maven project From

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,550
here we can filter May Virna to suggest the maven options

8
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,250
offered by the new project with ______.

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,260
And we have three options are take out existing married

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,440
project from source control management,

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,340
create a maven module or creative maven project,

12
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,210
and this is what we're going to click next.

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,550
We are going to skip the archetype selection A.

14
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,640
So just create a simple project.

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,040
Next.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,680
As you know, a maven project is known by three elements.

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,630
A group i d.

18
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,450
An artifact 80 and version A.

19
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,240
So let us die.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,300
Pena, A group i d an artifact i d, which is also the name of the Java project.

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,850
A loose Aries.

22
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,410
And let us simplify the version.

23
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:33,750
Number 20 that one letters creek finish and now the a Cliff Smith Virna,

24
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:41,140
begin as created Ello service project which has this form.

25
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,880
I just kept the message service plain java is he

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,340
project opened to see the difference.

27
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,960
A typical maven project as a four folders are two for the source code and the

28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,130
test code and two for the resource is are both main and test resource is this

29
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,070
is the first difference but there is another one.

30
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:11,940
The default maven project is created depending on double fiver.

31
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,280
Java five has been released in 2000 for and there is very

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,650
little chance that this is what you want to do.

33
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,980
So we'll first need to change that.

34
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:32,000
And at last we have the bomb. That example five that has bean created for us.
