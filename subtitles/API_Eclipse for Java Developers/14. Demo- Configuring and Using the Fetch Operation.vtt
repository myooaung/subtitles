00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.840
[Autogenerated] let us now make a modification to the remote git

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.170
repository by adding a read me file to it.

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.140
And this read me file is just finer leaders committed.

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.980
We have now a nice read me filer in our repository,

5
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.950
adding a process we created a new commit.

6
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:32.440
The Sha Wana is seven b wana And if we go back to eclipse,

7
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.850
we can see in our history that the last commit we have is full c four

8
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.160
which is not the last commit in our gettable repository.

9
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.100
So the best thing to do for the moment is to fetch those

10
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.340
modification a get this last commit present on the guitar

11
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.960
repository and not present on our local repository.

12
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.770
So for that,

13
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.090
we need to configure the fetch operation which is the second operation

14
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.710
that we haven't touched yet in this origin noted.

15
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.700
So let us do that.

16
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.900
Configure fetch.

17
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.410
Let us check this.

18
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.160
The u airai is correct.

19
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.840
The ssh protocol has been selected a let us click finish advanced.

20
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.600
We want to fetch all the branches and all the tags are Let us click,

21
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.730
finish and say and you see that the credentials we created for the push

22
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.220
operation have also been used for the fetch operation.

23
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.700
So no password has been asked.

24
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.940
Now we can just fetch the modification locally.

25
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.640
Here is the report.

26
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.260
Let us click.

27
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.920
OK, let us go in the history.

28
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.740
Select the project here and we can see that the Origin Devil branch

29
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.140
is on the same commit as I would Devil Branch.

30
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.600
But the Origin Master branch is one commit ahead.

31
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.400
So what we just need to do is to merger this commit in our master branch.

32
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.030
It is, of course, just a fast forward merger.

33
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.260
And they read me.

34
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.970
That modern fighter has been created locally.

35
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.640
Letters add some content to this.

36
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.440
Read me.

37
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.610
Welcome to sample.

38
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.180
Get for Parasite.

39
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.810
This is a simple repository for my pro cycles eclipse for Java.

40
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.710
Developers are used to push on fetch elements.

41
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.570
By the way, we have a nice preview in the Eclipse interface.

42
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.500
Let us commit this code.

43
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.800
Um added some comments in the read me we can directly commit and push.

44
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.120
Let us do that.

45
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.240
This is the report for the push Operation A.

46
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.440
That is close.

47
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.710
Check the history.

48
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.010
The last commit with the leader was the B four.

49
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:14.000
You see, Let us check here refreshed issue. And indeed, the before we see commit has been properly pushed to get up.
