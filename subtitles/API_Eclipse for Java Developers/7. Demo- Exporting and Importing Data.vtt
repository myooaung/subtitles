00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.740
[Autogenerated] I can also directly export the data of a table in a text filer.

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.940
Using these option Ana the pop up menu of a table Noda extract.

3
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.670
I can choose the Koran Dream eater, comma semicolon,

4
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.040
etcetera the character ________.

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.920
Dairy meter letters click finish.

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.540
So the creation of the user filer is mentioned in the

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.390
sequel results of you and the user file itself is correctly

8
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.540
created in the files of a folder.

9
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.180
Here is the content of the file In plain text,

10
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.380
we can check the contrary letters.

11
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.200
They let the data from the user table.

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.340
I'll see to run this.

13
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.490
If I run the select count once again, I'll see the count is now zero.

14
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.030
So I have dilated the content of the table that is,

15
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.040
Go back to the data source view.

16
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.270
See,

17
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.560
like the user pop up menu data loader navigate to the user

18
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.460
that txt filer import this data in the table.

19
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.540
The sequel results view tells us that six Rosa have been created A

20
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.790
and indeed a If I run the select count once again,

21
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.620
I'll see I have now the six users that are back in my database.

22
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.800
So this import export functionality is also very Andy,

23
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:45.000
especially if you already have data in a text fight that you want to import directly within my secret.
