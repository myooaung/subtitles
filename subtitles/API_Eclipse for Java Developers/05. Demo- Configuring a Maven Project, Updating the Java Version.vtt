00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.240
[Autogenerated] there is begin by opening this bomber that

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.510
exemplified This is in fact the main configuration.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.650
File off any maven project when we open it.

4
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.750
We are presented with a graphical user interface with the content of this pump.

5
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.740
Fight in it and you can interact with this content using this interface.

6
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.600
Personally, I'm not too found of it.

7
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.420
I prefer to interact directly with the XML file

8
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.060
which gives a more precise you off.

9
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.380
What?

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.170
Seen this bomb that XML filer.

11
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.570
You can see the XML by clicking this button Here,

12
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.330
let us do some quick for Matina so we can see that our poem just

13
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.540
took the group I d artifact I D and version that we just typed

14
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.030
in when we created that project.

15
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.020
The first thing we need to do is to fix this Java

16
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.360
five version on the right thing.

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.310
To do it is to go through Maven,

18
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.930
We're going to user this properties elements from

19
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.390
the bomb that examined fighter.

20
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.880
The properties element is a standard element from the palm.

21
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.620
So you had the auto completion to create it and in this properties are element.

22
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.710
We can create two properties.

23
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.640
The first one is the May Virna compiler target.

24
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.640
Let us said this property toe one that eight Onda maven

25
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.760
compiler souls also to wander it It means that we're going to

26
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.690
type in a Java eight source code.

27
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.210
And we expect this source code to be compiled using Java eight.

28
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.630
By the way, we can also add another property which is the for Waner Project.

29
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.790
Build a source and Karina.

30
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.940
And the value of this property here is beautif eight.

31
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.540
Those are the three standard properties every maven project should provide.

32
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.200
Once this is Donna,

33
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.040
we can tell Eclipse We change the version of Java for this project.

34
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.240
Now can you have date automatically your reckless

35
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.940
project taking into account this change.

36
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.180
For that we can use the pop up menu of our project.

37
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.090
Go to the Maidana option here.

38
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.040
Update Project that is Click this up, Jonah, Just click, OK?

39
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.320
And you can see that magically.

40
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:54.000
The Java five default configuration has been changed to Java eight to follow the configuration imposed by the bomb dot XML
