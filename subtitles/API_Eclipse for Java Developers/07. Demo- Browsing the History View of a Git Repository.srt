00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,990
[Autogenerated] to have a look at the state of a given repository in eclipse,

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:12,790
we need to open a special view window show view Other on this

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,560
special view is the history of you Open it on.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,840
It opened this history view in the perspective.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,920
Remember that it should try this on your own eclipse.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,440
This view may appear in a different place as this one,

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,350
but you can drag it on, drop it just like that to see it wherever you want.

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,710
Now there is something confusing with these you is that when you open it,

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,920
there is nothing in it and you can click whoever you want in this package,

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:52,870
explore view or in the Navigator view the is to review remains empty.

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,540
In fact, to browse the content of the git repository,

12
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:02,080
you need to click this icona in the history of you here and it

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,350
will synchronize with the package exploded view,

14
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,670
for instance, and we'll show you the Comets,

15
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,140
pretending to the elements you have selected in a package exporter view.

16
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,700
So those other comets for your project,

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,740
those other commits only for the user class that we created,

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,990
and we can see that we have the beginning of the show one

19
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,540
code of the commit the Master Branch,

20
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,340
the head Vietor branch the different commit

21
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:38,000
messages we have entered a the author, the date, etcetera.
