00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,710
[Autogenerated] let us add a, for instance,

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:12,490
to string method to our use a class by using the card generator

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:19,520
utilities from Eclipse Let us commit this modification A added to

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,610
string method a come it and you can say in the Serie that this commit

5
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,340
is automatically added to the list.

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:36,610
Now suppose we want to check out this commit in particular you know that it is

7
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,700
not a good habit when using gate to check out directly commit you better create

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,330
a branch on that commit and check out the branch.

9
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,050
So let us do this Wrong finger take out and you see

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,540
that a cliffs is giving us a warning.

11
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:59,050
It does is that by doing that we went in the detached head state.

12
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,150
It means that we are not on the local branch.

13
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,750
So if we want to do some modification and check them in, we will have trouble.

14
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,380
We might lose our commits.

15
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,240
So how can we go back one step?

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,090
How can we find a the last commit we had previously?

17
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,800
The problem is that by default this history view only shows the

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,030
current commit on the previews commits of the resource we have

19
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,940
selected And even if we see like the project itself,

20
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,790
it does not show us the commits.

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:37,440
After the comet we have checked out to see all the comets on all the branches

22
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,060
are we need to check this button on the Easter review show.

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,140
Old branches and tags are.

24
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,470
Let us do that.

25
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,050
And there we can see the commit.

26
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,570
We are honor under commits after that so we can go

27
00:01:52,570 --> 00:02:01,000
back to the master branch here, check out this and we are back to the correct state.
