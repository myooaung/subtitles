00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,850
[Autogenerated] Once we have done that,

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:09,480
the first thing we need to do is probably to create and configure the so

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,890
called getting no filer to filter out all the elements from that project

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,700
that we do not want to put in the git repository.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,410
This package Explorer view is not the right one to do that.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:29,340
So we are going to open another view from Eclipse Window Show View,

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,890
other filter the Navigator view on open this you,

8
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,460
the Navigator view shows all the Fizer within a project,

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,910
including the technical files,

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:48,410
are created by Eclipse and the hidden files that we do not usually

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,600
see and we can see that they are 25 on one folder that we want to

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,900
filter out from what get will handle.

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,740
The two fires are the dot class path on the DOT project,

14
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,510
which are Eclipse Technical.

15
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,800
Fizer under folder is, of course,

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,300
the bean folder in which eclipse is going to put the complied classes.

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:15,170
That's what going to right we do not want to under these compiled code using it,

18
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,520
the dot get ignore fied has already been created for us by the beginner.

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,400
So let us open it.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,410
The Bean folder is already there,

21
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:30,910
so we just want to add a the class path on that project filer and we are

22
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:37,380
also going to add the dot Settings folder that is also created by Eclipse

23
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,520
to stall some information on our project on.

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,640
By doing so, you can see that the respect of some file icons have changed.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,830
Now the dot class path and the DOD project fight icons are not

26
00:01:51,830 --> 00:02:00,000
marked with the question mark sign anymore. Only the dot getting no file is.
