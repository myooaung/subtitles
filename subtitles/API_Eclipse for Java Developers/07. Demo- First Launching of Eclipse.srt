00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,700
[Autogenerated] So I have prepared here two versions of Eclipse.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,420
The first one is the Java e Neon, our version of Eclipse,

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,540
which is the first neon version released.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,620
And the second one is the Java e oxygen to pack agia,

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:26,640
which is the last version off the oxygen eclipse available As of today,

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,010
I've also created to short cuts on the desktop to launch.

7
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,950
Those two versions are easily it is very easy to install eclipse.

8
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,940
In fact, you do not need to install it in a windows way.

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,340
All you need to do is to open the zip archive you've downloaded from the

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,910
Eclipse Website on Copy the content in any director you want.

11
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,500
So let us first launch the Java e Neon.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,440
Our version.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,010
The first thing eclipses asking us is to choose a directory in

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,030
which it is going to create the workspace.

15
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,590
Remember,

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,090
the workspace is the director in which Eclipse is going to create our

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,970
project on store all our directories and files.

18
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,740
Er so let us click OK,

19
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,650
neon is launching a and we are soon presented with the welcomes you

20
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,340
with a set of links to various documentation,

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,740
tutorial and configuration settings.

22
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,340
Let us closed is you.

23
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,220
We are now presented with the default Java e perspective.

24
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,740
We can tell that this is the Java e perspective by checking

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,880
the top right corner off this you I here.

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,290
This is the Java e perspective that is selected If

27
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,940
you do not have this perspective,

28
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,730
er it's probably because you didn't download the right version of eclipse.

29
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,530
Probably the java s e warm.

30
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,260
We're not going to go any further with this.

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:11,000
You I for the moment because what I would like to show you is how things can go wrong on how to fix them.
