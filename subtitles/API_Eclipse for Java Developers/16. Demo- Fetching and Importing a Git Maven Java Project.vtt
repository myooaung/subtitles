00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.600
[Autogenerated] the other context.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.380
You may find yourself into it when you want to import an existing Java project,

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.800
but that happens to be a maven project.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.330
Here.

5
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.960
I created another get herb repository called sample Maven.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.890
Get for per site.

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.660
And you can see that there is a Obama that XML file in this

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.240
repository making this project a maven project.

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.190
The previews project we import odor was not amazing project.

10
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.140
It was just a plain A job, a C project.

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.890
And now we have a maven project.

12
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.120
So we are going to clone it.

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.940
Using is this h that is copies to the clip border.

14
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.970
And there is a special Haganah to import this project directly,

15
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.030
making the creation of the Maven project simpler than the Java sea stuff.

16
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.930
Basically,

17
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.620
we will not have to deal with the face that property off this

18
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.990
project as we had to do in the previous case.

19
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.940
Let us see how it works.

20
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.430
We can either imported directly select the maven stuff here and check

21
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.240
out maven project from Source control Management.

22
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.740
Huh?

23
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.380
Create a new project at in the May Vanna note.

24
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.230
Here we have also the same option.

25
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.760
Check out Maven projects from a C.

26
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.010
M.

27
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.470
That s quick next.

28
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.900
Now,

29
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.740
the problem is that the default eclipse installation A comes with no

30
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.040
support off no source control management system.

31
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.530
For that,

32
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.630
we need to install a special Pugin that is not prison by

33
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.640
default in the eclipse installation, we can click on this link.

34
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.140
Find more source control management connectors on the marketplace.

35
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.830
So let us go to this marketplace and what you want

36
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.570
to do is look for em to e dash.

37
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.360
Get select this M two e dash, get plug in here.

38
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.060
Click finish Next.

39
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.440
Next, accept the license.

40
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.770
Finish install anyway, restart your eclipse.

41
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.620
And when this is done, you're good to go.

42
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.610
So let us import.

43
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.710
May Virna Checkouts maven projects from source control

44
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.190
Management Next And now you can see that you have Ah,

45
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.820
the git option which is available.

46
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.180
Let us paste Are the your eye of our repository?

47
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.940
Check out Ed revision za, which is finer.

48
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.220
Click next.

49
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.170
Everything is fine here click OK.

50
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:13.000
And this time the project is directly imported from get herb to our repository and properly configured as a Maybourne Java project
