00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.440
[Autogenerated] let us go back to eclipse.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.770
How can I tell a clips that I want to add a remote repository to my get project?

3
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.940
Well, there is a special view for that.

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.150
So window show view other.

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.640
Select the git elements from that list.

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.660
Open the git repository.

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.710
Here we are going to move these view to here and here We

8
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.550
have a representation off our sample.

9
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.590
Get project whether the branches are local branches,

10
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.240
devil and master on the remote element with nothing in it.

11
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.640
Let us click on this remote element.

12
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.440
Create remote.

13
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.070
Let us keep the default name origin.

14
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.640
This is finer and select the configure push operation A.

15
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.580
Okay,

16
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.640
We need to provide you a wry for this remote repository

17
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.240
for that That is creek on changer.

18
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.970
And since I have copy pasted this your IRA, the based is automatically Donna.

19
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.040
When opening this window, the hostages get up That comma.

20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.570
The repository pass is my user name and simple Get for parasites which is

21
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.660
the name of my repository and for the authentication.

22
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.070
A.

23
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.040
Since this is https,

24
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.960
I need to provide my user name and my password and click finish.

25
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.370
Now the second thing I need to do is to provide what

26
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.660
is called ref map Ing's in a jail.

27
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.100
It tells a gate what branches and what labels to push to the

28
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.790
remote repository razor on the matching between the local

29
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.540
branches on the remote branches.

30
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.750
Here we can click the advanced, but IRNA,

31
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.510
My local git is fetching information from Get Herber,

32
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.740
and since the guitar repository is completely empty,

33
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.830
it does not give me, of course,

34
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.330
any branch or label that would already exists in the remote repository.

35
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.200
If the credentials I have entered are not correct, I will not see this window.

36
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.010
I would be presented with another window to change my credentials.

37
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.800
Here I am going to push.

38
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.790
All the branches are on all the tags are and keep the

39
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.340
names as they are in my local repository.

40
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.330
Let us click.

41
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.230
Finish, they say,

42
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.860
is the configuration off the push operation from my local

43
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.540
repository to the remote repository.

44
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.360
So now we can save it.

45
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.540
If I wanted to push, I could click saving Bush.

46
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.420
But for now,

47
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.450
I'm just going to savor this information on a and you can see

48
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.830
that now in the remotes Noda off these you.

49
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.240
I have this or Aegina repository that is configured A

50
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.520
with a push on the pool operation.

51
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.910
Now I can select the push element.

52
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.360
Click on the push options from the pop up menu.

53
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.910
I have toe enter my name once again.

54
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.040
A since I am using https, let me click.

55
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.340
Ok, And now the push operation has been done.

56
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.120
The Devil branch has been pushed toe a devil remote branch and the master

57
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.080
branch has been pushed to the remote master branch.

58
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.460
Let us close that Check What's happening on the get part?

59
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.440
Let us select this repository.

60
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.000
Indeed.

61
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.460
A.

62
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.760
I have nine commits that have been pushed.

63
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.150
The nine commits I have created on my local repository

64
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.760
and two branches master and deviled.

65
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.870
And I can check also the devil branch that I have created locally.

66
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:09.000
So those other steps you need to follow to push a local repository to a remote git repository, for instance
