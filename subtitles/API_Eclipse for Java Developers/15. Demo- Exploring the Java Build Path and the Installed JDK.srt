1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,250
[Autogenerated] that is configured this project for the And for that,

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,140
we're going to open the properties of this project.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,590
I can reach those properties from the pop up menu on

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,390
the project Node off this package.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,770
Explorer here at the bottom A.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,820
Oh, I can also use this out.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,240
Enter shortcut, which is sometimes much more handy.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,150
It gives made the following panel and I'm going to show you the Java

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,390
bill path option off this panel at first here,

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,840
I can see that our project is running using Devon Aina

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,250
from the libraries here I have the two options of German

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,890
aina the model path with the J.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,020
D.

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,390
K on it and the class path.

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,040
This is a Jabba nine, only optional.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,100
By the way, if you want to learn more about this model path and class path,

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:00,430
you can check the driver nine model calls available here on per site.

18
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,070
There is also a project abba with another module bath and class

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,840
path that we're going to see in a minute and the soul stab that

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,940
we are also going to see in a minute.

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,620
For the moment,

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:20,580
I would like to concentrate on this declaration of the jury by default,

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,130
Eclipse chose er the J.

24
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,280
D.

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,720
K.

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,200
It is using to rent itself as a job application.

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,340
What can we do if we want to develop, For instance, a Java eight project?

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,100
We need to change the declaration of the J.

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,220
D.

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,960
K.

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,010
At the project level.

32
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,240
This is going to be done in the library.

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,870
Taba.

34
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,370
Off this panel, click the Declaration of the J.

35
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:45,500
D.

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,430
K.

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,440
If it's a Java nine a decoration, it will be on the module path.

38
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
Here.

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,280
We can then edit this,

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,900
and we are presented with another panel that would show us all the J.

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,040
D.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,280
K that are known a tow eclipse here.

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,340
If we click the environments button here,

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,050
Eclipse will show us all the versions off the J.

45
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,190
D.

46
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,890
K.

47
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,520
Noser and the associate ID installed.

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,490
Jaedicke eight.

49
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,140
For instance.

50
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,230
If I click on Java a C nine here, it shows me that it knows where a J.

51
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,350
D.

52
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:20,510
K.

53
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,140
Nine is installed on my local machine.

54
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,940
A.

55
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:36,000
If I click on Java eight here, it just tells me that to range over eight, it will be using Java nine in a Java eight compatible way
