00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.620
[Autogenerated] So let us now launch the latest version of the cliffs,

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.840
which is oxygen too.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.720
And let us use the same workspace as the one we used with the neon

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.840
version we just tried to launch a few seconds ago.

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.440
So let's click Launch.

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.070
You see that this work space has been created with an

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.190
older version of Eclipse and in fact,

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.680
inside that workspace in configuration Fiza,

9
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.030
the version of Eclipse used to create it,

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.700
has been recorded.

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.150
So since we're using a more recent version of eclipse than

12
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.230
the one used to create this workspace eclipses going toe

13
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.040
upgrade this workspace for us.

14
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.620
But there is a warning because going back to the old version Una

15
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.140
might lead to loss of information so you can move a workspace from an

16
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.720
old version of eclipse to in your Wallner.

17
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.450
You can also move back to an older version of the cliffs,

18
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.840
but you might lose information in this process.

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.880
So here we are going to do that.

20
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.040
Let us just click, OK and proceed with the launching.

21
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.200
So we are welcome with almost the same view as the old version of Eclipse.

22
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.210
Let us closed is you.

23
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.000
And now what we have is the default Java e perspective in this version of Eclipse
