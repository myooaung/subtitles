1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,060
[Autogenerated] Now what we would like to do is go to the next

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,490
level and create an enterprise level application.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,440
So let us create a second project Nujoma Project.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,830
We are going to use the same Jaedicke 88 version of this project and call

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:26,900
this project message service eclipses warning us because by default we're

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,630
still using a Java nine compiler for that.

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,370
In fact, the Javan nine compiler is still set up at the workspace level.

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,650
So all the Java projects we are creating in this workspace are going to inherit

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:48,140
this property that has finished this open message service.

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,700
Open the properties of it.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,570
Check the compiler and shake here enable the project.

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,540
Specific settings are click on the gun figure project settings.

13
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,480
And now from here we can select Java eight.

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,040
Eclipse is giving us another warning because by default it is going to use

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,300
a Java nine a virtual machina to create our project.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:19,830
We can also override this by selecting here jk eight instead of J d.

17
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,960
K.

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,240
Nine.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,640
Let us apply in close.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:33,000
We will go through a full rebuild, of course. And now things are configured, Jeff eight at the workspace level.
