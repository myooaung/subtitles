00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,020
[Autogenerated] Since this is aware application,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,800
let us create a first very simple HTML page.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,780
We can do that with the pop up menu of the project.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,400
New.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,480
HTML Feiler This HTML file has to be stole.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,010
The in a very special directory off this project on the Maven Pregnant knows

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,320
that it is going to put it in the SLC main Web APP folder,

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,130
which is exactly what we need.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,480
There is called This filer index dot html a next.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,840
That does make it an HTML five filer.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,040
This is finer.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,400
We have this fight created here It is in the SRC main Web APP folder.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,810
This is a were welcome pager that has put some

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,340
Messager welcome to our new Web app.

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,220
Now we have some busy content.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,810
In a way, we're BAP, and what we would like to do is run it.

17
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,180
In fact, it's quite simple to do that.

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,290
All we need to do is see,

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,040
like the project pop up menu on the project of older

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,180
runners and select rent on server.

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,430
Do not select a job application because we do not have

22
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,940
any main method in this project, so the breaking will be confused.

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,790
It is going to ask us.

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,720
Which server do you want to run?

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,610
A This application honor.

26
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,330
Of course, it is the Apache Tomcat server that was just installed.

27
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,790
We can see, like the server runtime environment here.

28
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,120
If we add others that they would appear here in this drop down menu.

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,640
And if we click next,

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,600
we are presented with the configuration of the instance

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,170
of Tomcat that is going to run here.

32
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:50,030
All we want to do is run the maven Web app application a lettuce click finish.

33
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,510
It quickly opens the servers view at the bottom of the screener with a

34
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,140
node representing the Tomcat server that is running A.

35
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,590
If we open this note, we see that I were maven.

36
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,340
Web project has been deployed in this Tomcat server at a welcome page

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,050
that is displayed in the internal browser of Eclipse.

38
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:22,000
We can copy paste this your ella on open it in a chrome browser, for instance for the exact same results
