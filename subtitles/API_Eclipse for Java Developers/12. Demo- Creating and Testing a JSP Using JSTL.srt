1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,600
[Autogenerated] In order for this to work, we need to other too dependent.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,200
Cesar to the pom xml off our Maybourne descriptor.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,030
The first Warner is the devil e dependency from the Djebbour X back Agia

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,240
Here it is on the one we need is the Java e web a p i.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,090
Since we are only using the web profile of the E.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,350
And the second dependency we want to add a is the J S T

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,690
Ella Java server tag labor library,

8
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:38,050
which is either this one on the two or even the Java X that

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,310
several it one do not use the JST l a dash a p I because this

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,350
is not the one we want to use.

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,080
Okay, Once we've done that,

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:56,500
we can create our jsp filer users a dash least dot jsp there is click finish.

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,060
Let us check that these users dash list The jsp is indeed a the

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,360
fight to which we are forwarding the request,

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,700
which is the case.

16
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,770
We are going to other first tag labor Here, take labour.

17
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,010
The prefix is the standard one c and the your eye.

18
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,860
Eser.

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:26,040
Http java dot Sana that comma slash jsp slash j STL slash

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,820
call If you make a mistake in typing this,

21
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,350
you arrive for instance You forget the e u will have an error

22
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,660
message from the Js people again of eclipse telling you that this

23
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:45,020
year I is not recognised So this is Ah, I were uses list.

24
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,240
It's too uses list is the full winger We are going to use the

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,170
forage tagger from the standard tag laborer Reza,

26
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:03,950
let us take a user As of our on items are will be request scope that user

27
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:10,450
list And for each user we are going just to display the user that name

28
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:16,140
Karam User that age our Jsp is now correct.

29
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,710
If we want to runner our project, we can also drag and drop it on the Tomcat.

30
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:27,040
Noda from the servers view Launch Tomcat by clicking on this but IRNA

31
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,500
the console should tell us that everything is fine.

32
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,720
Then go back to our Crume application A make a request on

33
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,750
user Dutch list and here we have the list of the users of

34
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,860
that has been sent by the separate.

35
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,890
We can just check that this is correct.

36
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,300
Let us go back to the Sublette modifier.

37
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,130
The ages.

38
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,740
For instance, 22 here, When you modify or serve, let Tomcat has to be restarted.

39
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,640
Republishing the web is not enough.

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,890
So let us do that.

41
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,320
Restart the server by clicking this button.

42
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,490
This is Donna.

43
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:13,000
Go back to Chroma Refresh. And indeed, the ages have been updated.
