1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,210
[Autogenerated] let us see all this in action.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,540
A letters first, create projects in eclipse and configure git toe.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,840
Handle the source code of those projects.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,610
Then we are going to create commits on play with them.

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,630
We are then going to push a local repository to remote git

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,870
repository in give Herber and create a project from an

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,580
existing remote git repository.

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,040
So let us begin.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,380
We have here a simple java, a C eight project that we want to share with get.

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,840
We want to control the source code of this project using it.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,280
We are going to begin by configure this project and then create

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,050
some content in it and create comets using it.

13
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,570
The first thing we might want to do is go to the preferences of get so

14
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:06,940
window preferences are Let us make this little bigger filter on get here

15
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,950
and we have here a set off configuration option forgets there is one

16
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,440
that we're going to use right now.

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:23,780
This configuration here I am going to add the user that name with my name and

18
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:31,310
user dot emailer with my mail address on those two values are going to be used

19
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:37,300
by gate automatically to feeling the author on the email address under the two

20
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,840
inch Come it let us playing closer.

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,480
Now is the second step.

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,140
Let us create a git repository with this project.

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,880
We can do that with the pop up menu off the project.

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,950
The team option Here, choose a share project here.

25
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,970
If your local eclipse installation has a support for

26
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,740
other source control management system,

27
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,550
then get you will have an intermediate pain with for

28
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:11,940
instance as viene CVS Fear case, etcetera.

29
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,420
Here we have only get so let us create this repository in the parent folder.

30
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,540
Select the project here.

31
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,870
Click Create,

32
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:29,260
Repository finish And then we are done and we can see that visually speaking,

33
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,340
the appearance of the project in the package Explorer has changed the burial.

34
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:41,110
Now I have this greater than a sign in front of the project Icona.

35
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,870
And there is this little golden sitting there on this project

36
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:53,000
Icon to that shows that this project is handled. Bag it
