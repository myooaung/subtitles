00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.240
[Autogenerated] I will not go into much detail to describe what the

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.780
perspective is because thought gentle or did that in his eclipse guided

3
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.340
through calls available here on Parasite.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.740
In a nutshell, Perspective is just an arrangement of a toolbar and a set of user.

5
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.130
Here we have the Project Explorer on the left,

6
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.710
the outline on the right and several views at the bottom of this You.

7
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.240
I let us first create a Java project.

8
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.640
We have several solutions for that.

9
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.520
The first Wallner is to see, like the pop up menu from the Project Explorer on.

10
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.240
Then click on Project here we will be presented with this battle.

11
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.390
We can also get the same panel by clicking the button

12
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.990
here and selecting new project here.

13
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.530
From this, we're going to select the Java project.

14
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.540
Next.

15
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.120
Given a motto our project Let us call it First Project.

16
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.480
Choose a a J.

17
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.630
D.

18
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.130
K.

19
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.150
To run our project by default, Eclipse will use the same J.

20
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.290
D.

21
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.900
K.

22
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.950
As the Wallner.

23
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.390
It is using itself on a project Lee outward and here

24
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.420
we're going to use the default.

25
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.140
Create separate folders for sources and class file.

26
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.790
Let us click.

27
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.910
Finish eclipse is asking us if want to switch to the Java perspective,

28
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.970
which is a little simpler than the Java e perspective.

29
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.990
So let us do that and you see that we have a simple

30
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.830
little bar on an arrangement of use,

31
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.480
which is slightly different and on the top right of this,

32
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.020
why?

33
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.350
Who?

34
00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:00.000
We can choose to go back to the Java e perspective, all to stay on the Java SC perspective.
