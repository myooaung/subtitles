00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,180
So of course you need to know little about Java.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,390
It is mostly life coding and step by step demos.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,770
My goal with this course is really to show you how to find your way

You need to know little about what the job over to mission is.

14
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,590
What by code is the difference between the Java

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,530
development kit on the Java runtime environment.

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,500
Basically, in a nutshell.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,970
In a Java development kit, you have all the tools to create job applications,

18
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,460
whereas in the j.

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,400
R E Java runtime environment, you don't have them.
