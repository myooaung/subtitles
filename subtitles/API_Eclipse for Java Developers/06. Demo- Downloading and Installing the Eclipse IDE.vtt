[Autogenerated] with those first key concept in minder letters.

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.840
Try to launch eclipse in this life growing section.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.440
Er,

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.240
let us make it _____ because eclipse can _____ when it's launched due to bad

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.040
configuration and especially due to bad Java configuration.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.370
So to fiddle with this,

7
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:29.440
we are going to do that and we're going to set up Java projects in it.

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.490
So to download a cliffs, of course,

9
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.090
the first thing you need to do is to visit the official eclipse

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.620
projector that really the value that eclipse that organ on.

and it is the first project that you can download from this page of now

18
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.040
there are two solutions to download and install eclipse.

19
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.360
Either you download the installer with this,

20
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.620
but China download 64 bits on this is going to download a small application

21
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.080
that itself will be able to download the full eclipse.

22
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.910
I d e.

23
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.450
Or you can go to download Package is a here,

24
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.990
and this is what we're going to do from this pager you can choose which pre

25
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.350
package eclipse distribution you want to download er on.

26
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.330
The one we're going to choose for these calls is the

27
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.940
eclipse I D for Java e developers, a version 64 bits.

28
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.290
If you want more details on the content of the back ager,

29
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.240
you can click on this link and you will get to kind of information on this page.

30
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.350
First, the content of the package.

31
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.470
Here you can see that on the Java e developer tradition of eclipse,

32
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.100
you have many things about data, tools, JavaScript,

33
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:09.440
html XML on the like, and you also have informations on the releases of Eclipse.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.140
As of this recording, the conversion is the oxygen version.

35
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.100
The upcoming version will be the photon Virgina,

36
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.400
and the previous one is the neon version.

37
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.330
The major versions of Eclipse are released the on the

38
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.020

We get a new letter each year,

43
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.040
so this year this is the old letter on the oxygen version.
