1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,260
[Autogenerated] let us see now how we can create a several

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,370
million project in the same workspace and create dependency

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,040
between one project on the other.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,900
And for that, we're going to re factor this code.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,320
This is a service, and we all know that in fact,

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,020
the service should have an implementation and an interface.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,940
And the implementation, of course, should implement this interface.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,600
So let us rename this project Re Fekter Rename A Aero

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,140
Services that Megan is not too happy because this artifact

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,180
should be really called L o service.

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,080
Bash him.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,700
So let us do that to have an artifact that matches the name of the project.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,810
This class, we're going to rename it.

14
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:03,250
And I have a shortcut for that, which is al shift our hello service him.

15
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:11,440
And I am going to create another project, New Project Maven Project.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,640
Next,

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,190
create a simple project group I d organ that Tomorrow and the artifact i d l

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:27,500
o dash service The version Ana is going to be 0.1 finish.

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,540
And these ello surveys will contain a a singer into face pack agia ____

20
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,640
that promote that service and creator on interface in it.

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,370
Hello, service finish.

22
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:49,590
Whether this only one method a public string that get message.

23
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,670
And of course, what I would like to do is to say,

24
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,470
All right, you are going to implement a look service.

25
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,190
Of course,

26
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,340
this is not going to combine because the ello service

27
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:11,000
interface is not in the same eclipse project, and I need to create a dependency from this project to the other one.
