automatically connected to the connection profile I have

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.990
selected in the data source Explorer.

8
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.670
So if, for instance,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.610
I type in a another query select count from User see like this

10
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.040

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.190
And if I want to see the results,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.170
I need to click on this button here to see that I have six users in my table,

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.770

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.900
make it a list of Fuser object and print out its user.

18
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.630
That was from this coda as a job application.

19
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.140

20
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.590
I have all the content off my table that is displayed by this coat.

21
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.470
