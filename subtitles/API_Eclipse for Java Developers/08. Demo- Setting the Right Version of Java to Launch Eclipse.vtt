00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.040
[Autogenerated] let us launch near again.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.340
A.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.070
Here we are welcome with an error message telling us that version.

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.380
Want that seven of the Java virtual machine is not suitable for this product,

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.100
and that version wondered.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.780
Eight or greater is required.

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.740
Remember that it lives in the Java software.

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.220
So you need a Java installation on your machine for eclipse to Rhona,

9
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.740
whether you are on the windows machine, my caresses or line ex machina.

10
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.210
But having a simple Java installation is not enough.

11
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.410
You also need to have a recent version of Java wandered.

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.640
Seven is just too old.

13
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.270
How can you check that?

14
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.490
Let us get rid of this error, Miss Asia.

15
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.420
Well, you can just try to die.

16
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.220
Pena Java dash version And indeed, here we have a job, I wondered.

17
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.330
Seven Installation A.

18
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.120
Which is a too old for this version of eclipse.

19
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.880
Now, if you can change this version of Java toe wondered eight for Shanna.

20
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.020
You're good to go when this is what you should be doing.

21
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.920
By the way, Wondered seven is an obsolete version of devil.

22
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.640
You should not be using that anymore.

23
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.820
But if you're on a machine on which you cannot change that

24
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.040
version a Then you need to do something else.

25
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.780
Let us close.

26
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.420
And this one,

27
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.710
er visit the Eclipse Neon directory and checked for these cliffs

28
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.840
that any configuration file that a super in it.

29
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.490
And here just before the dash VM ogg za option,

30
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.970
we can type in a these option dash VM with a path to the java w dot xy

31
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.340
executable filer from within a Java installation.

32
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.440
Here we are declaring the J.

33
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.600
D.

34
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.920
K wanted 81 40 for subversion.

35
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.240
It is.

36
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.970
Savor this Violeta,
