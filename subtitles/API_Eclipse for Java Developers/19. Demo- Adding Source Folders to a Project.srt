00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,280
[Autogenerated] Now let us see how we can add external

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,320
dependencies with external jars,

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,570
a twitch of a project and let us see how we can organize.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,040
I was source code in different directories.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,490
Currently we only have one, which is the SRC directory.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,050
Since we are all serious Javadi proposal, we like to write tests.

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:33,540
So let us create a test for this message Service Gold message service test

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,350
finish And what I want to do is off course created test here first I created

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,510
it in the same souls directory as my business class,

10
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,250
which is Mr Service and off course.

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,240
This I do not want to.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,190
I would like my test to be in a separate territory.

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:53,760
To do that,

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,030
we need to create another source code directory

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,040
within our message service project.

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,840
So let us go back to the properties of our Project Bill Path

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,540
option here on the sole stab here we are going to add a

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,840
folder in the source for his list.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,640
Create new folder.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,300
I'm going to call it s L C.

21
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:26,840
That's fist finish and selected as a source folder.

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,040
Okay.

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,980
And now it appears, along with message surveys slash SRC as a source folder.

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,200
Let us Brian close.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,630
And you can see that this associate,

26
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:47,200
that test source folder is now shown in the package Explorer.

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:56,180
So let us move this class from these SLC directory to the SLC test directory.

28
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,080
Eclipse was kind enough to also keep the package of this class.

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:08,540
By the way, I am going to fix the name of this class by renaming it.

30
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:19,000
There is a shortcut for this, which is out shift are like rename er and now I can write my test in it.
