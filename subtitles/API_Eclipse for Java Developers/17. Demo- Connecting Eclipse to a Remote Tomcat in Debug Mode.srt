[Autogenerated] Tom Cata is a Java application and in fact there is a special

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,480
mechanism A at the Java virtual machine level that allows to open a port a

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,950
special de burgh port that eclipses able to connect to.

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,580
So let us do that.

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,700
Let us go back to our common light.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,410
Tullow, let us stop our Tomcat.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:33,340
Katarina, stop and let us run it again with the option Ah, DPD a start.

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,700
This option means a Java platform a D burger architecture.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,300
In fact,

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,890
it triggers a special options at the JV M level that are fully

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,680
documented on this page with the following link.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,500
So if you want to have more information,

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,840
you should refer to this page which contains the full

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,340
documentation of this technique.

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,520
Now, this Tomcat is launched in debug mode,

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,190
so Eclipse will be able to connect to this instance of

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,640
Tomcat to get some debug information.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,420
To do that,

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,440
we need to create a de burger configuration from here so de burgh configuration,

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,580
but is made precisely for the beginner.

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,240
You want to select remote Java application here,

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,580
create a new launch configuration.

23
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,110
Let us call it Web app, Tomcat, the burger Select the project,

24
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,100
which is our Maybourne Web up.

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,010
And in fact,

26
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,370
all the other options are selected by default on this pain are correct,

27
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,510
the other one we are going to use and let us adder this debate

28
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,440
configuration to the favorites menu of the debug menu.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,880
So let us supply closer.

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,470
Switch to the D Burger perspective of Eclipse.

31
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,500
Click on this D burger button from the toolbar and select Web

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,630
app Tomcat debug and see what is happening.

33
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,500
Now The D Back view is connecting to the instance of Tomcat we just launched,

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,800
and we have now the list of the threads that Tomcat

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:23,000
has been launching on our machine, So we are not ready to connect to our Web application in debug mode.
