1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,500
[Autogenerated] suppose now that we have some debug

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,170
to do in the coda of the serve, let or in any other Depakote off our application.

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:17,010
Using this interface, we can also starts Tomcat in debug mode.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,070
Let's do that.

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,100
And to stop the running Tomcat, go back to the service you and launch it.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,080
But this time in debug mode instead.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,440
Off run motor, Let us creek here.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,280
Now Tom Cat is running and instead of running in a normal mode,

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,640
it is running in debug mode.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,580
As a stated here,

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:44,120
we can put a break point in a Servette launch this request

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,810
once again A a crepe sir is asking if we want to switch to

13
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,560
the de burgh perspective, Let us click.

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,410
Yes.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,280
And from now on a We are debugging inside the code of our separate That is,

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,050
click if cysts to step one liner here by hovering the valuable We

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,890
have the content of the variable We can check the list of users are

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,770
Let us allowed this window a little.

19
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,110
Check the different users one by one if we wish and then a run the code

20
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,840
again by clicking the resume er but on here by the way.

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,730
All the _______ for the debug mode to control the way the

22
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,640
application is running are here on the task.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:36,000
Wow. So this little trick enables you to de burgh your application using eclipse.
