1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,620
[Autogenerated] we still have two elements to cover,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,190
which are the same but in two different context which

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,190
consists in a fetching repository.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,940
Locally, when we have no code locally.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,220
So here I just closed the the sample get project.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,780
I will still be using this simple get project from Get Herber on.

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,030
What I want to do is to import it locally so that I can go

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,040
in the package Explorer pop up menu,

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,080
select the import options here that is open this or

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,440
it'll I have This gets no doubt there.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,590
So I can imported projects from a git repository.

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,710
I am going to use a cloner.

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:54,520
You are I here I am presented with the same kind of window as the fetch window.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,940
We already so the u airai is the get your IRA using ssh

15
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,540
that does he liked SS age protocol Here.

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,270
Click next.

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,360
Since we have already configured eclipse to connect to get eclipses able

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,640
to query this git repository to get everything here,

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,340
let us click next.

20
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,240
We are going to create this project locally in sample,

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,390
get for poorer sight and automatically get will register this

22
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:34,620
remote repository as the origin repository keeping you this

23
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:41,170
configuration it is Click next and we are going to import this

24
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,740
project as a general project.

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,160
The name of this project will be the same as the repository Letters Click

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,490
Finish on Now we have this project created here for us.

27
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:01,040
The problem is that this project as search is not seen as a Java project.

28
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,550
Why?

29
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:07,220
Because we decided not to push the dot project on the dot class path

30
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,760
Eclipse configuration Pfizer to get Herber so Eclipse could not

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
recognize this project as a Java project.

32
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,540
Once we've done that,

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,440
we need to tell Eclipse that this project is a Java project.

34
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,740
So select the project.

35
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,340
Pop up menu properties.

36
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,640
Oh,

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,980
here we are going to select the project Facets from this property

38
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,400
windows convert to faceted former Just select java here,

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,540
select a run time here which is a Java eight,

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,510
her playing closer and we are down.

41
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,140
We now have a proper Jeff project.

42
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,990
So those steps other steps you want to follow when you want to import an

43
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:01,940
existing Java project from a remote repository locally.

44
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,540
By the way, if we check the git repositories er of you,

45
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,580
we can see that in the remotes.

46
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:19,000
Noda, the guitar repository, has been automatically configured with proper push and fetch operations
