00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:08.430
[Autogenerated] let us take a quick overview off water Java e application is on.

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.510
What is it made off?

3
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.010
So what is a Java e application?

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.050
Typically, a Java e application can be seen as a Web application.

5
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.280
More or less sophisticated.

6
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.330
It has a set of Java classes are serve.

7
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.630
Let's Web servicers a rest service arreaza, some static resources.

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.210
Think about HTML pages.

9
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.200
CSS five j peg images, audio files a video.

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.070
Five.

11
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.340
It has some dynamic Pedroza.

12
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.120
Think about Jeb for several pages of or JSF Pedroza.

13
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.830
It has some javascript five and at some meta data in XML,

14
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.870
descriptors and sometimes even more elements like

15
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.940
these one that are not cited here.

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.530
So a Java e application is quite a complex subject, made off many things.

17
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.820
Many elements.

18
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.940
We will see very simple Java e application in this module.

19
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.340
By the way, if you're not familiar with what Java E application is,

20
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.410
you may check the Java e keyword here on parasite,

21
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.840
and it will give you several call Soza return by many

22
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.390
people on many aspects of Java.

23
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.640
The good news is that Eclipse fully supports all that,

24
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.600
including serve, Let's Web services rest servicers,

25
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.980
ex cetera.

26
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.940
It can create a special Djebbour E project connected to

27
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.400
application server Rosa and can support those Jeffer A

28
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.000
project through the use off May Virna. And this is what we're going to see.
