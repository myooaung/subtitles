[Autogenerated] Hello.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,460
My name is Jos.

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,020
A.

4
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:10,240
I am very glad to welcome you back to this eclipse for Java developers calls.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,830
This module covers the connection of Eclipse to database servers

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,440
with the example off my sequel database server.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,730
What are you going to learn?

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:22,940
A.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,200
In this Majola?

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:31,660
Well, basically how to work with database servers from within Eclipse,

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,080
which my look very handy A Clips comes with a sequel.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,570
Play Ginna at least the Java e version of Eclipse,

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,040
which is the one we are talking about in this course.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,480
First, you will configure it clips to connect to databases.

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,550
Server za.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,340
On the example will be the mice equal later per server.

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,840
And in a second step,

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,220
you will see how to create a on configure the connection

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,040
to a particular database instance.

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,150
And then when this is done,

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:21,000
you will be able to create tables other and query for data import and export data from and to your database server
