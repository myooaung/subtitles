1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,350
[Autogenerated] So first let us create a first class in this project.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,080
We can open it like that to create a class we can see like the

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,640
SLC Fuller knew and class from the pop up menu.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,400
Or,

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,520
if you prefer to use the tool bar a new class from

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,110
these button from the toolbar.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,640
The result is of course, the same.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,840
We are going to put our class in a package A because using the default

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,100
package or the empty back agia is not recommended in Java.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,480
In fact, you should not be doing that, especially in Java.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,730
Naina and we are going to create an L A world class.

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,440
Let us ask Eclipse to create a main method for us.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:01:01,000
Click finish. And now, in the middle of you, we have our class opened in the Java Editor.
