00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.230
[Autogenerated] let us quickly go through a few of

2
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.740
the cliffs i d e key concepts.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.940
First of all, eclipses a software written in Java.

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.140
It means that you can Rennick lives online.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:23.240
X windows or Mac OS is and this is almost the same version, UNC.

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.590
The only difference is the look and feel.

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.880

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.740
same menus, etcetera.

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.040
So it means that you need to have a Java installation

10

this is the Java it will use by default to handle your project.

16
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.670
So these version of Java will be the default Lee chosen

17
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.680
version used by Eclipse to handle your projects.

18
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:16.000
