[Autogenerated] before we move all Now, I would like to show you a second point,

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,950
which is how to customize the way Eclipse formats,

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,440
your Java code.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,120
It takes place in the window preferences at once again.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,940
A.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,340
You are looking for the format option here.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,130
Java Code style for matter.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,040
Let us see like this Wallner edit the cliffs, building a format here.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,940
Since we're going to modify it, I'm going to call it Josie.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,140
For instance, I prefer toe have spacers instead of tabs a toe,

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,840
India and Mike Odor.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,760
So I am going to click here on the spaces only top policy and

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,440
choose for which is a nice default value for me.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,340
Let me a plier and click OK, a play in closer.

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,540
Of course, this filer has not been changed since it already existed.

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,040
So let us deal ate it.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,100
Create another Warner of the same name Hello world,

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:27,000
and check the creation of the main method a click finish. And now you can see that the top character has been replaced by spaces
