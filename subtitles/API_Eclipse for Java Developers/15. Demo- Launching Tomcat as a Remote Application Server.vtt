00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.500
[Autogenerated] So we just So how to develop and deploy a Web

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.320
application with the clips in her local Tomcat installation.

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.750
And most of the time,

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.140
this is how you are going toe work in a really production environment.

5
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.090
But they are still situations where you need to debug a Web

6
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.950
application from a remote of cat installation A Not

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.770
necessarily a production environment.

8
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.800
It can also be some kind of testing environment.

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.490
And for that you need to declare this remote installation of Tomcat in eclipse.

10
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.670
So this is what we are going to see now how to connect to

11
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.930
this remote tomcat instance and the debug I will wear

12
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.720
implication in these remote installation.

13
00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.340
For that, we are going to launch an instance of Tomcat independently off eclipse.

14
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.750
We have a Tomcat installed in this directory.

15
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.240
It is a local Tomcat,

16
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.380
but we're going to connect to it just in the same way as

17
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.570
you would do it for a remote Tomcat.

18
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.880
There are several ways to launch Tomcat.

19
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.150
You have scripts in the BIN directory,

20
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.480
and one of the script is the Katarina scraped,

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.800
and you need to pass start as an option to it.

22
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.340
It will open another window and launch Tomcat here in almost half a second.

23
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.880
Now we have a running tomcat instance on this local machina,

24
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.490
and we can connect to it using any brother,

25
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.450
for instance, I have here a chrome browser and connecting a to local host 80 80.

26
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.240
We'll show this welcome page with different links to

27
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.780
various pages of documentation.

28
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.740
We are interested in the manager up off this pager.

29
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.900
Click the button here, and by default,

30
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.610
it will ask for password because this application is password protected.

31
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.690
If we try to connect with the default installation, it will not work.

32
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.560
And we quickly canceled.

33
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.570
It will show these page telling you that you need to add the

34
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.140
two following lines are to a special fighter.

35
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.440
Tomcat dash uses dot XML installed in the cough

36
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.440
directory of the Tomcat insulation.

37
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.060
So let us do that.

38
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.510
Let us copy those two lines are navigator to the root directory of our tomcat

39
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.610
installation A go to the golf subdirectory and edit this file.

40
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.240
Um,

41
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.510
in a note pad plus plus Navigated it all and just

42
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.020
copy paste those two lines here, save this fighter Now We need to restart Tomcat.

43
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.470
So let us do that.

44
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:09.630
Katarina, Stop and then Katarina start once again go back to our browser.

45
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.040
Refresh this page Are type in a dumb cat on the best word secret

46
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.940
with the three instead of the first e connect.

47
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.310
And now we are connected to the application manager of Tomcat with

48
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.100
the default applications are already deployed.

49
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.790
A dog's examples Host, manager and manager.

50
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.660
Now, probably if you have a really production Tomcat,

51
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:49.000
you will not see those applications because most of the time people do not let those application in a Tomcat installation.
