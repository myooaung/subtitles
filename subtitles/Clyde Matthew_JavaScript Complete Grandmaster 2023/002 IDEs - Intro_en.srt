1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,180
Well, if you are like me, you'll be getting frustrated using this console.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,130
It is a nightmare.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:12,190
And you can imagine, if you're building complicated websites isn't going to get much worse.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,790
And that brings us to the next kind of exciting aspect of JavaScript, and that is IDEs. And what is

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,360
an IDE? Well, it stands for an Integrated Development Environments.

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,430
Oof, that's a mouthful.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,010
So everyone just calls it IDEs.

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,590
And all an IDE is, is a place we write and test our code.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,860
And your next question is going to be what's the best IDE?

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,350
And the answer very much depends on what kind of programming you want to do.

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,670
You always want to use a text editor that's oriented towards your language.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,910
Some IDEs have support for several dozen languages, and the one that I use does and I'll show you

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,200
that in a sec, and is free.

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,510
An IDE typically contains a code editor, an interpreter and a debugger, which means you can do a

15
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,420
whole lot of stuff with one program, and a lot of them also have extensions so you can add in awesome

16
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,870
linters and source code formatting and auto completion for you.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,580
They are a plethora of code editors and IDEs out there, so I'm going to give you the ones that I found

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,150
really cool.

19
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,250
Feel free to explore Google. The online ones,

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,410
okay, you need an internet connection,

21
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:32,480
the online ones that I find really cool are codePen, JSFiddle, JS Bin, Plunker,

22
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,750
there's a newish one, which is Observable Playbook.

23
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,900
I haven't played around too much with it, but I have done a little bit of coding on there.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,720
But the offline one, the one that I absolutely love and use every single day is what's known as a

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,730
Visual Studio Code.

26
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,860
I mean, you gotta love a logo like that.

27
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,410
And we're going to be working a lot with Visual Studio Code in this course.

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,600
I really encourage you to go and download it.

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,320
It's free and I won't take you through the installation process.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,370
I think it's pretty straightforward.

31
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:10,150
But you'll notice that there are two main parts to this Visual Studio Code. #1, the actual file

32
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,150
you're working on, which is where we type all our code.

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,290
The other one is where we put all our files, our images, our server code, our configuration files, all of that

34
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,250
goes on the left.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,420
And then what's really cool Visual Studio Code is you've got an Extensions tab.

36
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,650
You know, you can see here I'm using Go Live, which is like a live server,

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,990
so it basically just means I can run it (the HTML) in a browser very easily, and I'll show you how that works

38
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,410
shortly.

39
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,870
So I hope you enjoy this course.

40
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,240
We're going to be using a lot of this text editor specifically, but feel free to use one of your

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,570
choice.
