00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,070
We're getting very familiar now with creating objects via the literal syntax.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,360
And like I mentioned, it's the most easy way to create objects in JavaScript.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,560
But the second type is known as an object constructor.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,680
And this is an alternative way to create an object.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,370
But don't worry, the constructor means making or constructing something.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,190
So don't get intimidated by the word constructor function because all it is is that it's a normal function

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,990
that just creates an object.

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,870
I don't know why we have to have all this jargon.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,940
I guess it does just simplify things.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,200
Instead of calling it a function that creates an object, you just call it a constructor function.

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,270
OK, so how does this work?

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,030
Well, in order to use the object construction, you have to go through two steps.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,150
One, you have to define your object.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,710
Kind of make sense.

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,410
You have to define what it is you wanting to create.

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,200
And then two, you've got to actually construct it.

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,130
You've got to call it.

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,650
And you do this with the new keyword.

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,450
Let's have a look at a quick example.
