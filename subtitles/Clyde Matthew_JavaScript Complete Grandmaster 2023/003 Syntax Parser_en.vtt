00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.230
And before we move on to the next lecture, just understand why we have to write things certain ways.

2
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.590
This brings us to what's known as a syntax parser. And all a parser is, 

3
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.010
it's a program.

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.030
It's a program that reads your code to determine if it's valid.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.110
And again, don't get intimidated by all these words and concepts.

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.010
Just take a step back and realize your code is not magic.

7
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.450
The interpreter has to convert your code, your letters that you've typed, into instructions the computer

8
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.020
can understand. And part of the interpreter is what's known as the syntax parser.

9
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.430
And the syntax parser basically goes through your code line by line, character-by-character,

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.190
and it would tell you whether your grammar, aka your syntax, is correct.

11
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.230
That's why when we were typing things that were incorrect, we would get an error message - that's from

12
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.790
the syntax parser. And if it recognizes everything and everything's in the right order

13
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.300
you won't get an error message and it does what you would expect.

14
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.570
Hope it's starting to make sense.
