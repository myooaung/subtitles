1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,580
Before we move on from the console, there's just one brief thing I just want to go over and that's something 

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,670
called "substitutions". And given its name, you can kind of guess that it's replacing something with something

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,670
else because you substitute one thing for something else.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,250
In this case, in JavaScript, we denote this with the percentage sign.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,630
In other words, you're replacing a percentage sign with something else.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,230
For example, in JavaScript, a %s means you're going to be replacing that with a string.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,360
So, for example, with console.log("Hi %s"), the second parameter is what's replaced with that

8
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,350
%s.

9
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:47,430
So in this case, it's going to display with "Hi there", and the "s" keyword is not the only thing available.

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,240
You've also got d, c and o, which replaces different things,

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,550
integers, CSS and objects in this case.

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,920
Let me show you a quick example, and then we can move on.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,530
Cool.

14
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,680
So let's look at an example quickly.

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:09,820
Let's say we want to type "33 green apples", and we want to put these in a variable.

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,680
So we'll create here a variable, and we'll get into variables later,

17
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,550
and how much did we say? 33 apples, so let's say var number equals 33.

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,520
And let's say 

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,520
the color is green.

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,290
OK, so we have two variables. We've got number and  color. And we want to display "33 green applies". 

21
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,220
How would we do that?

22
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,840
Well, let's use substitutions ... console.log()

23
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,700
it's an integer which is d.

24
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:55,280
Second thing we want to display is a string, so whats that, that is an "s". 

25
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,580
Is that right?

26
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,470
Let's see if that works! Invalid or unexpected token.

27
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,810
What did I do wrong here?

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,100
Oh, I forgot 

29
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,250
to close that off.

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,910
ummmmm, no man, silly, silly, silly.

31
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:32,470
I put the percentage afterwards, it should be before. This is where not having a text editor is excruciating. 

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,680
But there you go. So I've replaced the %d's with the number and the %s with the color, and

33
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,060
we get "33 green applies". 

34
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:49,510
The reason why this isn't so important now is because ES6 has (introduced) "template literals", and these can

35
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,970
be a substitution to this approach.

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,370
Because this can be quite cumbersome.

37
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,810
Do you want me to show you what I mean?

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,170
Allright.

39
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,270
Well, we've already defined number and color.

40
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,430
So let's, let's use the latest syntax, and you'll see how much more easy it is.

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:09,460
You go console.log() and you use back ticks `` now with the new ES6 syntax.

42
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,740
And it's that little button above your "tab" key 

43
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,340
or to the left of the number 1 key, but depending ... 

44
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,210
(swoosh sound)
It's this little thing. You can see what it looks like.

45
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,190
Okay, you put two of them instead of quotation marks, and inside I can write,

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,330
oh, and then whenever you want to put in a variable, you've got to use a dollar sign and open curly

47
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,230
brackets.

48
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,270
OK, so here it's the number,

49
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,270
it's the color.

50
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,230
apples.

51
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,610
And if I execute that, we get exactly the same thing.

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,370
The preferred approach is the second approach, which is why I don't really want to harp on too much

53
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,400
about substitutions.

54
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:49,810
Cool.

55
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,290
Let's go.

56
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:50,920
Let's move on.
