00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:04,450
Oh,

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,190
fancy seeing you here!

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,560
I guess you want to find out about variables.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,420
Well, using and storing data is the backbone of writing code.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,210
And if JavaScript couldn't do it, it would be a pretty useless language.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,170
So lucky for us, it can do it, and it does it very well. 

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,450
I'm excited about the section.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,570
It's all going to be about variables. And sometimes you want your variables to change.

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,930
Sometimes you want to explicitly state that you want a variable to never change. And you've already seen

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,890
us use variables.

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,060
I've been using the "let" word often in these lectures,
(music starts)
so hopefully some of it's familiar, but enough

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,360
said.

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,610
Let's learn about variables.
