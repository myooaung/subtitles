1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,170
Cool.

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,620
We're moving on, we're moving on.

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:03,550
Just keep going.

4
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,290
Hang in there, guys.

5
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:04,810
Hang in there.

6
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,380
Come on.

7
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,670
We're going to get there soon.

8
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,200
OK, so machine code, right?

9
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:14,890
We know that machine code is basically zeros and ones that your computer can understand.

10
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,970
The question is now what do I mean by "your computer

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,840
can understand it?"

12
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,770
Well, a computer is really just a processor.

13
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,270
Okay.

14
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,060
The question now that I have is, "well, how does your processor understand these zeros and ones?"

15
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:31,990
How does it work?
