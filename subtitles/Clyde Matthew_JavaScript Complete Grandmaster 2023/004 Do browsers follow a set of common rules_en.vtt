00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.320
Oh, all right.

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.430
So I've seen that a browser's main function is to present a resource to us, and in many instances,

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.770
that resource starts with HDMI followed.

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.610
But now you might be asking yourself how browsers, right?

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.960
This is someone who watches over them is their set of rules and standards that apply to blossom.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.040
And that's a good question.

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.430
And the answer to that is yes is a consortium, a large organization called W3C.

8
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.040
And it just stands for the World Wide Web Consortium.

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.670
And this is just an organization that has defined specifications as to how browsers should function.

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.250
In theory, having one set of rules sounds great.

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.710
But in practice, we live in a capitalist world.

12
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.400
And what that means is that every company wants to better the other.

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.800
So start browsers have tended to only pick and choose what rules they want to follow.

14
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.080
And this is, you guessed it, of course, serious compatibility issues when it comes to coding because

15
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.900
some browsers accept certain code while others don't.

16
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.099
And this caused problem for web authors and by we both as well.

17
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.040
I mean, as someone who puts on content onto a webpage.

18
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.630
So you'll see a lot.

19
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.370
That's all the code that we have to redefine code for different browsers.

20
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.700
Now the good news is that this is kind of falling away now.

21
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.140
A lot of browsers are starting to come full, and I'll show you example of that in a second.

22
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.800
But what's interesting is that these specifications defined by the W3C, they don't define UI.

23
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.920
They don't define user interface.

24
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.230
But over the years, through lots of trial and error, most of the UI elements have started to conform

25
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.710
with each other.

26
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.920
All these browsers that started to imitate each other.

27
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.670
They've learned that the user expects certain elements on a web page to be in certain places.

28
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.860
And with that said, they need to show you a very quick example by comparing two browsers.

29
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.210
Well, let's start with the most popular browser in the world, and that is Chrome.

30
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.640
You can see we've won that pretty small.

31
00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.590
We've got a refresh ball.

32
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.030
We've got forward and back buttons.

33
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.770
We've got a toolbar.

34
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.710
Make a menu item that's pretty standard.

35
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.610
And now if we compare this to Mozilla, it's also got an address bar refresh for the big buttons and

36
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.750
it's also got a toolbar.

37
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.440
And the point I'm trying to make with all of this is that you will come across when you coding in your

38
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.860
career.

39
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.070
You're going to come across a lot of old code that has compatibility issues with different browsers.

40
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.520
And for that reason, you're going to see code split up to cater for different version browsers.

41
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.930
But the good news is that this is starting to fall away for reasons we've just discussed.

42
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.040
So without further ado, let's get into some more meaty stuff.
