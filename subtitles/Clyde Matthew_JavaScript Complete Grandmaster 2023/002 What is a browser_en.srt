1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,570
I guess there's no better place to start than with the browser, and as I'm sure you know, a browser

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,960
is just a program used to display files and navigate the web.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,310
We know that I use Chrome all the time on my iPhone, I use Safari.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:20,550
These are browsers, and the browser's main functionality is to present a resource that we choose.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,260
And it does this by requesting it from the server and displaying it in the browser window.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,670
And if why this process has to be done super duper quick, because yes, you and I are very impatient

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,630
when it comes to Googling.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,730
When it comes to loading web pages on the web and how fast is fast, what are we going to get into that

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,120
later?

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,730
But for now, just know that Google researchers have suggested that page load times of less than 100

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,390
milliseconds.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,920
Not that we can achieve this.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,040
I'm just saying, if we can, that gives us the illusion of instantaneous website responses because

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,350
our visual sensory memory process inside our brain works in bursts of one hundred milliseconds.

15
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,630
Anyway, that's just a bit of a fly.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,430
So we know that Brazil's main functionality is to present a resource that we choose to us.

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,830
But what resources am I talking about?

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,440
All but the most obvious one is HTML.

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,290
Every website that you load has to begin with this fall, but they also are the resources we may want

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,220
to load, like images, PDFs, ex email Jason.

21
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,180
Seizes JavaScript and so on and so forth.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,520
But that's all well and good, so we know that we need to get a resource.

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,390
The next question is, will we test the browser, find this resource?

24
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,170
Where does it go?

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,130
And the answer to this is that the location of the resource specified by the You or I, the Uniform

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,810
Resource Identifier.

27
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,210
OK.

28
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,960
Already, you just want to see an example.

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Well, let's just come up with a fictitious website.

30
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,120
My site dot com.

31
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,130
And once you enter this, you are all that you seeing on the screen into your dress line.

32
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,520
The browser will break this down into three distinct parts.

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,620
Can you guess what parts they are?

34
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,759
Well, you can kind of even guess intuitively what would be the first one will be HTP, and this is

35
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,509
the protocol.

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,110
This is the set of rules that govern how browsers speak to servers.

37
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,660
We're going to get into the soon, so that's the first aspect it breaks down into.

38
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,350
Secondly, it breaks down your server's name.

39
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:29,740
This is the site you want to go visit and in order for your browser to actually connect to the web server.

40
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,210
In this case, my site dot com to retrieve the information we requested.

41
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,780
It has to communicate with a name server that translates the server name into an IP address, and the

42
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,280
IP address is literally that.

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,960
It's an address.

44
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,280
It's a place where your browser can go and fetch that file from your web browsers, then able to connect

45
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,330
to the web server at the resolved IP address, usually on Port 80.

46
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,160
So that's the second item.

47
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,900
We've got a protocol.

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,010
We've got the server name.

49
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,530
And lastly, we've got the actual resource we want to collect.

50
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,620
So once your browser is connected to the web server using the HTTP protocol, in this example, the

51
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,990
browser will then read the hypertext markup language that index dot HMO file.

52
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,490
And this is the authoring language used to create documents on the worldwide web.

53
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,890
And then, of course, what happens next?

54
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,110
The daughters display to you on the screen.

55
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:27,160
So they have it a very, very high level view of the process your browser goes through in order to server

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,690
file to your web page.
