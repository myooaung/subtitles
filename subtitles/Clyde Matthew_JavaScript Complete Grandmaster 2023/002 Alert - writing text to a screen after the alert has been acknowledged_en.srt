1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,730
Allright, we're going to get more and more complicated as we go on.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,390
So say now we want to click a button, shown an alert, and when you click okay on that alert, text is replaced

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,410
on the screen with something.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,270
How would we do that?

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:13,770
Let's go.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,050
Let's create an HTML document.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,220
And again, let's create a button

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,850
with an "onclick" event.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,890
Let's just call this one alert ... alertMe.

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,260
alertMe is not defined. Again, we've got to write JavaScript.

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,050
JavaScript has to be inserted within script tags.

12
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,680
We need to now define the alertMe function.

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,440
Don't worry about the syntax around functions, we're gonna learn about that shortly.

14
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,980
You'll see how it all fits in, and how to write a function.

15
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,280
Now, after you click OK on this alert, what do you want executed beneath it?

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,460
Remember with JavaScript, or actually it's the browser, the parser, it starts from the top

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,000
to the bottom.

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,030
So once this alert is done, it's going to execute what's beneath it. And say we want on the screen,

19
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,480
This text was

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,360
replaced with JavaScript.

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,470
This text was placed here with JavaScript.

22
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,110
Let's try and run this code.

23
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,640
I would expect to see an alert.

24
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,540
Well, I'd expect to see a button. When we click the button

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,770
we should see an alert.

26
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,910
And after the alert, we should see text put onto the screen because we've used document, and remember document

27
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,920
is a global object.

28
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,720
It's almost, but it's not quite the king,

29
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,600
remember Window is the king, but under Window

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,830
you've got this big object

31
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:21,590
called "document", and this document is your web page and all we're saying, is we accessing a method called

32
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,230
write(), which literally just puts text on that page.

33
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,700
It's as simple as that.

34
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,150
Let's see what this looks like.

35
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,090
There's our button "click me please". 

36
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,040
When I click it, there's an alert. 

37
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,220
And what happens when I click OK?

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,230
The text was replaced. How awesome is that?

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,610
Let's move on.
