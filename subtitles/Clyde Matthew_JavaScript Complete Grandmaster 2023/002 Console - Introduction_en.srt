1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,770
Let's start coding.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,050
So let's open up Google Chrome.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,940
Okay, its opened up. Right click and go "Inspect".

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,410
And then click on this Console button here.

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,390
And there you have it.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,570
This, ladies and gentlemen, is the Console.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,750
And don't worry about the Elements, Sources, Networks, etc etc.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,440
For now, we just want to start playing around with the Console.

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,320
So what is the Console?

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,220
Let's start playing. You know, like I said, this is where we write JavaScript code.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,990
Let's start typing something.

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,040
So let's write "dog".

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,440
Man, what does this mean? Uncaught ReferenceError: dog is not defined?

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,390
Well, of course "dog" isn't defined.

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,630
We haven't told the computer what "dog" is, so that kind of makes sense.

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,620
What about some random text?

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,590
Same thing.

18
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,560
"alskdjfklasjf" is not defined, either.

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,700
Makes sense, right?

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,690
So it's not scary.

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,090
You can click this little button here to clear the console to get rid of everything you've typed. 

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,870
Let's try something else.

23
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,060
What about one plus five?

24
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,500
See if that works.

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,360
Push "enter" or "return" on your keyboard. And yep, there you go. It evaluates an expression.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,290
How was that done?

27
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:22,250
Well, the awesome thing is, that is JavaScript running on your browser. It literally knows what a one

28
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,320
is, what that little plus sign means,

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:32,090
and that five. And some clever programmers have written a program in the browser that interprets that into

30
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,450
machine code that displays the result for you.

31
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,410
And this is what the Console is. The fact that we could write one plus five, and then it printed back

32
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:39,920
a result,

33
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,100
six,

34
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,360
that is what the Console does.

35
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,650
All it is, is it's an awesome way for us to see immediate results.

36
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,500
Let's jump into something quickly before we continue.

37
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,370
All right.

38
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,660
A quick, quick break.

39
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,040
We know a Console is a place where we can write and run JavaScript code.

40
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,320
Let me just break it down a little bit more for you.

41
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,460
The Console serves two main purposes.

42
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,130
The one is diagnostic

43
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:13,520
information - it gives you information about your code, it helps you fix bugs and helps you change elements

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,300
on a page.

45
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,980
That's what I mean by diagnostic info.

46
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:22,190
The second function that console provides us is awesome, guys, and that is to write JavaScript.

47
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,830
And you've just seen some of the code that we've written. And I mentioned this in the last lecture,

48
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,100
I mentioned that the Console gives us the ability to read, evaluate, print and loop.

49
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:38,930
I just want to dive a little bit more into what I mean by read and evaluate, because it's really important

50
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,990
to understand how the Console works and how JavaScript works.

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,760
In the programming world, there are few little terminologies that help us along the way.

52
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,190
And one of these is what's known as an Expression.

53
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,650
What's an Expression? Well, think about when we type "1 + 1" into the Console, or we type "dog", we're

54
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,150
telling the computer what we want it to do, or what we want it to evaluate, that is called an Expression.

55
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,730
And the process that the computer takes to transform that Expression into response,

56
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,960
that whole process is called an evaluation. And the last part of it is that when the process of

57
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,130
evaluation is done

58
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,530
you're left with a value.

59
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,070
In the case of "one plus one", we're left with a value of "two".

60
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,460
Taking a step back, I want you to start thinking when we type this code, think about that. Expression

61
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,430
results in the computer evaluating that expression, which results in a value. Cool,

62
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:33,690
That's it.

63
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,470
Let's move on.
