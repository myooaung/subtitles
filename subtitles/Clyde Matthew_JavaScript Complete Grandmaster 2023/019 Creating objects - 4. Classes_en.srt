1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,710
Who we have come a long way.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:09,960
Alright, the fourth way to create an object is with forces, specifically the East 2015 class syntax.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:18,550
Other programming languages, for example, Java, Python, they use classes to define objects, and

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,780
people were battling to understand Java scripts, prototype or inheritance.

5
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,920
Again, we're going to have a whole bonus section on project talks and how that all works.

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,020
But it is confusing, especially if you have come from another language that uses class syntax.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:40,410
So to solve this problem in 2015, ActionScript or year six introduced classes and under the hood,

8
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,810
and I want to stress this JavaScript is still the same.

9
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,280
This class that has been introduced is just syntactic sugar.

10
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,740
It's kind of a sugar coating, but it doesn't change JavaScript in any way.

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,630
JavaScript still uses prototypes.

12
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,690
It just now rips it within the class keywords, so people coming from other languages are not that intimidated

13
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,110
by it.

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,060
Let me show you how classes work.
