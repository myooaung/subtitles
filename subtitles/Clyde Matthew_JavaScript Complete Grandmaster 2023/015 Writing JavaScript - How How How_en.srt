1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,170
To start writing JavaScript, or before we can start writing JavaScript

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,970
there's 3 big questions and these 3 big questions relate to the big ...

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,140
HOW.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,390
1) How do we write it?

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,210
And by that, I literally mean, where do we actually type words. 2)

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,330
How does a source code convert to machine code?

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,500
How do you get your JavaScript to be converted to machine code?

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,990
And the last question is 3) how to execute your JavaScript?

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,960
So going on to the first question, which is relatively easy, all you have to do is recall that

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,190
source code is just text.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,590
So this means that you can pretty much write your JavaScript in any, um, text editor.

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,960
You can write in Word, you can write in Notepad or anything else that suits your fancy.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,070
The important point to remember is that you can write JavaScript anywhere.

14
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,840
Moving onto the second question is "how does source code convert into machine code?"

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,390
Is this something you need to be concerned about as a programmer?

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,880
Well, I believe it's good to understand it.

17
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,830
Like I said, I've got a firm philosophy in understanding the basics before, you know, diving into

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,970
the more complicated stuff.

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,510
So, yes, I do think it's important for you to understand how your JavaScript is converted into machine

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:12,840
code.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,210
Well, in order for me to tell you that, you need to understand the difference between "compiling" and

22
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:18,900
"interpreting".
