1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,430
OK, so she was met at random, is this just create a new file very quickly?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,880
I know this is a long letter, so I won't be I won't be long.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,700
We'll just call it M.J. Is this just close everything else?

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,990
Just explain the general concept of what was done.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,020
I want to start quicker.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,010
And now let me show you what it is we did.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,470
Firstly, what does Method Random do?

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,400
It's inbuilt into JavaScript, so we have access to this object automatically.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,710
Let's just say lit.

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,970
No equal method random.

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,880
And later console mode, this number.

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,820
There you go.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,270
And every time we say the fall, we get a new random number.

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,940
But you'll notice that these numbers are between zero and one.

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:53,450
So when we have our array in this, just let's just say lit array equals one, three and five.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,520
To access these, we have to either use zero, one or two.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:06,050
For example, if I wanted a console log out the first element in inside the brackets, the square brackets,

18
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,880
I have to have whole integers.

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,340
In this case, I'd have to have zero.

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,070
One or two?

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,280
And that retrieves the value out of that array.

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,400
So you agree with me already with conscious use?

23
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,910
No, because no, and I'm keep saving now, so you can see it's always between zero and one.

24
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,310
So that's precisely why we multiplied the myth Dr random by number and what number should we multiply

25
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:31,620
by?

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,400
Well, we had four quotes, so we multiplied it by four.

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,060
We console log.

28
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,470
The rate of length.

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,350
Yeah, we've got three, but to keep it similar to the previous example, I'll show you, let's just

30
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,510
put one more now we've got four.

31
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,160
So we multiply this by four, but instead of actually writing the number four, we just said, Okay,

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,030
well, let's just multiply it by its length.

33
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,040
Now we know that the largest number this can be is four in the smallest number.

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,970
This can be zero.

35
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,930
You with me so far?

36
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,130
Great.

37
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,850
But now can you see how these produce such random numbers?

38
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:18,640
If we tried to go array and we tried to access a number like this won't be able to doesn't exist, it

39
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,750
has to be a whole number.

40
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,350
And that's why we use method or flaw in the method.

41
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,870
Floor always returns the largest integer less than or equal to a certain number.

42
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,960
So, for example, on the screen at the moment, we see numbers two point nine four zero using --

43
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,070
floor just return to its assigned to make sense.

44
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:46,480
So all we did was we included a -- don't flow function in front of a whole description here.

45
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,450
And there you go.

46
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,820
So now the no variable always be between zero and three.

47
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,110
How awesome is this?

48
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,160
That's exactly what we did, which allowed us to access all the elements in there.

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,190
I hope it's making sense.

50
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,880
Let's move on.
