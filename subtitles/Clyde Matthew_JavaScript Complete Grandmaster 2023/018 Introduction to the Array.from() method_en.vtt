00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.030
I hope you have a lot of fun in this course as much as I am.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.570
I love putting these things together and I love teaching what I've kind of learnt over many, many years.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:14.160
Anyway, the next thing I want us to discuss very briefly is another very useful good, a little bit

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.580
advanced function in JavaScript called array from.

5
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.630
And what does this mean to do what the very day, the basic level, all it does is it creates an array,

6
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.990
but not from an array, because that would be pointless.

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.320
It creates an array from two types of different things.

8
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.070
Creates an array from one, an array like object and all.

9
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.160
I mean by that is that it's an object that has a length property and to you can create an array from

10
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.110
an interval object.

11
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.820
Things like metal set.

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.370
Anyway, this is more important right now.

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.790
The important thing to understand is that the array from method takes something and a it into an array.

14
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.180
And why do we want to do that?

15
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.170
Well, if we can create it into something that's like an array, we can have certain methods and properties

16
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.900
of animal to us that we can use on that newly created object or hold that newly created array.

17
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.640
So they're kind of making sense.

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.440
Don't worry if that's not the first thing I want you to understand with the array from method is that

19
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.750
it is on the array itself.

20
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.280
What I mean by this?

21
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.130
Let me jump over to the console and quickly show you I've got my console open here, and the only thing

22
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.400
I want to show you is way to find this from method.

23
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.830
And as I mentioned, it's on the array object within JavaScript itself.

24
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.780
How can I prove it to you?

25
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.800
Well, first, let's just console draw out the array.

26
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.450
And if we do that as the array provided to us by JavaScript, we open it up.

27
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.550
If we scroll down and there it is, the is the from method.

28
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.140
Pretty simple, right?

29
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.750
So there we go.

30
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.950
We know that the array from method is found on JavaScript array object.

31
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.390
Kind of makes sense, right?

32
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.890
But we are not finished yet.

33
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.820
Let me jump into the ledger and let's talk about this method in a little bit more detail.
