00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,670
Welcome to yet another kind of call it a Sydney bonus section slash teaser.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,100
So let me be clear right from the get go.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,650
This is not about JavaScript.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,920
It's completely beyond the scope of this course, but it is super useful to know as a programmer, as

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,570
a developer, because let's be honest, every single site that you visit, every single site that you'll

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,360
create will result in a request being made to a server and server, then has to deal with that request.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,120
Send back a response of data to browser, then has to deal with and data and displayed on a screen.

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,290
So understanding this entire process is very, very important.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,300
If you want to take your coding to the next level, which is why I just thought, you know what you've

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,220
been, you've been through such a long way.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,010
You've soldiered on, you've got to the end.

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,810
And I just wanted to give you a bit of a high level understanding on the critical rendering path.

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,190
What?

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,400
That's right.

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,620
The critical rendering path.

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,170
Remember that it is very, very important.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,540
And the critical rendering path just refers to the entire process I just discussed from the time your

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,070
browser sends a request to the time it has to receive that response from the server.

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,590
And then it has to figure out where everything goes on the page.

20
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,130
It has to put it into machine code to bots.

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:22,860
All of this happens very quickly, and you want to optimize this process so the user can see the content

22
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,830
on his or her screen immediately.

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,110
So that's a point with the critical rendering path.

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,070
But there's a lot to it because the browser has to construct the and document object model that has

25
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,370
to also construct its on.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,090
And of course, through this whole process, it has to build the brain to treat, but then has to figure

27
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,780
out the layout.

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,300
And then finally, it has to actually paint the pixels on the screen.

29
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,490
I know you're probably thinking, I've got no idea what you're talking about, but and that's okay.

30
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,270
Just sit back in these pictures.

31
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,500
You don't even have the code with me.

32
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,300
Grab a coffee, goes through it and enjoy it.

33
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,500
Just view this as a real bonus.

34
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,890
I was actually in two minds whether to put them on him, but I did.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,020
And because this course is about JavaScript, I have included videos that promote JavaScript relevant.

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,740
And again, I've only given you a quick snippet of these things.

37
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,730
We know we can't sit in hours and hours going through the critical rendering because one, this isn't

38
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,030
what the course is about and to you may not even be interested in learning about it.

39
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,720
But for me, it's incredibly fun and I would enjoy the session.

40
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,220
So, you know, don't give up.

41
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:20,790
Keep going.
