00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.190
If you're anything like me, you get frustrated with theory. You just want to see examples, so let me give you one.

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.910
Let's say you've got Wally, and Wally is a member of your website,

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.790
whatever that website that may be, let's call it BoomShakalaka. And let's say BoomShakalaka

4
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.100
is just an e-commerce site with a whole lot of products that their members can buy and

5
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.480
sell.

6
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.510
Well, why are data-types important?

7
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.480
Well, let's look at Wally in more detail.

8
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.980
Let's say you want to know information about Wally, you want to know his name,

9
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.530
how much funds he has in his account, is he currently logged on to the site,

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.260
and what items has he saved to favorites,

11
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.870
maybe he likes grass seeds and soap,

12
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.590
who knows?

13
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.600
If we take a step back and we look at all these chunks of data, you can clearly tell that there are different

14
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.250
types of values associated with each. Let's take Wally Smart. 

15
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.800
Well, that's an obvious one.

16
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.800
It's just text. In JavaScript, remember, we call these strings. Next, balance of funds, 34. 

17
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.200
That's a Number.

18
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.750
Is he currently logged on to your website?

19
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.160
Well, this is an interesting one, because there can only be yes or no.

20
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.100
In other words, it can only be true or false.

21
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.590
You can either be logged on or you can't.

22
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.510
And in JavaScript and in most other languages, this is known as a Boolean.

23
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.010
It's a Boolean type.

24
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.810
What about favorites?

25
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.040
What do you think that is?

26
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.190
You kind of right, if you saying it is a string.

27
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.050
But it's not just one string, is it?

28
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.440
It can be a whole lot of strings because maybe he's got one favorite.

29
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.430
Maybe he's got 20, maybe he's got 30. Hmm, 

30
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.930
so let's just say that this is a complex object,

31
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.480
for now.
