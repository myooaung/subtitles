00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.980
I would be a very bad teacher if I didn't tell you about adding comments to your JavaScript code. And

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.710
when I first started out, I was like "ag man, who needs comments?

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.870
You know, we'll will,

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.260
we're writing the code and 

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.960
we will remember it."

6
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.079
And truth be told, you just can't.

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.860
The good thing about comments is that they remind you in three weeks time, in three months time, maybe

8
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.690
even in three years time, what you were trying to do at that specific time.

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.330
So it's vital that you include comments in your code, not only for you, but it also tells other people

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.460
what your code is meant to be doing and the more complex you get with your code, the more comments

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.210
you should make.

12
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.720
But don't panic.

13
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.730
You can write whatever comments you want because comments are not executed.

14
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.720
It does not form part of JavaScript's executable code.

15
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.700
Well, how do you write comments?

16
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.990
There are a few ways.

17
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.530
If you're just wanting a one line comment, you can just put those two forward slashes //. If you're wanting 

18
00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.730
a multiline comment

19
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.570
you put it in a forward slash and a star /*. Put all your text there, and then end with a star and forward slash */.

20
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.800
It's that simple.

21
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.740
What's an example of comments?

22
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.820
A practical example?

23
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.920
And how do we actually include it in the code?

24
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.150
Well, let's type it

25
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.900
in here, let's do it. 

26
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.920
So let's say we are writing code about a dog.

27
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.580
Remember, the two forward-slashes are comments, so you can literally start typing.

28
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.990
This code relates to dogs and how

29
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.520
awesome they are.

30
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.670
And then you can write your real JavaScript code.

31
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.730
Well, instead of doing console.log, because I don't feel like opening the console, let's just go

32
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.120
document.write.

33
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.150
Simple.

34
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.260
Oh, I spelt it incorrectly. I was trying to figure out why it was not working. So there it is, there,

35
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.760
our text, that we've written.

36
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.130
And remember the other way? So this was totally ignored,

37
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.000
this comment.

38
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.410
So there you go, there you have it.

39
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.380
We can have comments that help us remember and tell others what our code is all about.

40
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.720
The other way you can write a comment, is

41
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.160
remember forward-slash and star?

42
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.420
My comments are on multiple lines.

43
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.680
And JavaScript will ignore that entire comment at the bottom.

44
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.930
Cool.

45
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.750
Let's continue.
