Heeey, you might be sitting there (scary music starts) and you might be thinking now "JavaScript is scary"
(quick change to happy music) 
but I'm here to tell you, 

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,490
she ain't scary!

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,790
Stick with me, and you going to think this thing is a breeze.

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,290
What's interesting with JavaScript is it's a safe language.

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:29,680
It doesn't provide low level access to memory or your CPU because it was initially created for browsers

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,090
which don't require that.

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:38,560
So the capabilities generally depend on the environment that you run JavaScript on. And,

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,040
when we typically think about JavaScript, especially when you starting out at the stage, you thinking

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,790
about it from a client user point of view, from a browser  point of view, and there JavaScript cannot

10
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,640
read files or write to them on your computer.

11
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,850
JavaScript in the browser can do everything, but only related to web page manipulation, interaction

12
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:07,390
with the user and the web server. For instance, in-browser JavaScript is capable of adding new

13
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:14,380
HTML to page, changing the existing content, modifying styles, reacting to user actions, doing things

14
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,960
on certain mouse clicks and pointer movements and key presses.

15
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,210
Simple right? It cannot execute though any other programs.

16
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:28,990
It cannot establish a connection to another computer, of course, except to download a new HTML page

17
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,130
or send mail.

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,870
And what's very cool about this language on the front end,

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,740
is that you cannot influence anything that's not contained by the browser.

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,400
So you might be thinking, well, why is this the case, why

21
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,650
why is JavaScript limited like this on the frontend?

22
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,800
Well, JavaScript abilities are limited in the browser for the user's safety - for yours and my safety.

23
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:59,930
The aim is to prevent a very nasty web page from accessing private information or harming your data.

24
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,060
And that's good.
