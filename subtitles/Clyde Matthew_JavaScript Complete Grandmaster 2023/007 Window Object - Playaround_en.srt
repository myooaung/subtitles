1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,760
So we've seen the Window object rules everything.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,960
Well, let's see some of the properties that we can access on this Window object.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,300
So let's open up the console as usual, and I'm just going to make this a bit smaller so you can see

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:13,930
what's going on.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,840
Now, if I drag this console, right, narrower and wider, you'll notice there are some numbers on the screen. 

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,930
And that's showing you the width in pixels, and height in pixels, of what the web page is, the website.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,870
And we can access these properties directly, which is an awesome thing.

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,910
So the first thing I want to show you here is, innerWidth and outerWidth - that's an interesting one. 

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,900
innerWidth, and 

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:43,890
outer

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,820
width. 

12
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,940
How awesome is that.

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,170
So this will show you the width inner and the width outer.  What do I mean by that? Well, have a look at this image quickly. 
(swoosh sound)

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,720
So the red is the innerWidth and the purple is the outerWidth. The outerWidth includes those scroll bars

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,230
and all of that.

16
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:12,590
And, back to our example, you've also got innerHeight and outerHeight, so lets try those. 

17
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,710
window.innerHeight window.outerHeight.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,430
OK.

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,860
And this is what I mean 
(swoosh sound)
innerHeight, outerHeight.

20
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:32,350
You've also got the screen, the screen object that's available via the Window object.

21
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,000
If that kind of makes sense. So within the Window, you can access the screen.

22
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,030
And that gives you access to another whole lot of other properties like left, and top, and all these things. 

23
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,300
So let's go screen.top, that's 39px. That's this little gap here. 

24
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:48,570
Yeah.

25
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,310
What about screen.left?

26
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,430
screen.left.

27
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,400
That's this bigger area here. And here's a screen to explain what I mean.
(swoosh sound)

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,310
And what about the entire width of the screen and the entire height of your computer or laptop screen?

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,130
Well, I'm going to introduce you to something else now quickly, and that's "document". 

30
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,760
Remember how we had console.log, and it just logs it (text) to your console?

31
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,740
We've also got document. And you can write to your document. And remember what the document was?

32
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,710
That was your actual HTML page.

33
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,190
So let's go document dot

34
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,980
write, 

35
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,700
open parentheses because this is a JavaScript function,

36
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,260
and now let's write "window.screen.width".

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,810
And there you go.

38
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,020
That's the the width of my screen. And we can do the same with height.

39
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,140
So now a quick protip, is if you push the Up Arrow, it goes to your last 

40
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,230
written statement, so I don't have to write out the whole thing again. 

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,120
And now let's write out height. 

42
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,380
There you go. 

43
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,390
How awesome is that?

44
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,220
So those are some useful commands with the Window object and the screen object, but why would that

45
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,150
be useful?

46
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,740
Think about if you want to perfectly align a modal that pops up on a user's screen regardless of the

47
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,670
device they're using.

48
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,790
Well you can use some of this and just mathematically always pick the center.

49
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,510
So that's one example I can think of a lot. A lot of this is fun.

50
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,100
You can explore and try your hands a few different things.

51
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,530
OK, so what other examples

52
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,650
can I give you?  Um, window

53
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,120
open is a good one.

54
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,080
window.open literally opens up a new window.

55
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,630
There's also one (a method) where we can move it around. 

56
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,620
I'll show you.

57
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,960
Maybe that is quite a cool example. So let's go

58
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,950
let's creates a new variable, and just call it myWindow. We   can call whatever we like.

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,100
And let's go now window.open. And you're allowed to pass a few parameters to the window.

60
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,350
The first one is a URL

61
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,010
in this case, we want it just to be no URL.

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,190
The second one (argument), is features. We want zero features. But now let's say we wanted a small window.

63
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,110
So we want to do a width of 200 and a height of, let's say, 100.

64
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,290
If I push "enter" what's going to happen?

65
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,170
It's going to open a new window, how cool is that?

66
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,209
Now, let's say I want to move that window around, how would I do that?

67
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,950
Well, we've got this variable called myWindow, which is why I did it in a variable and we're going

68
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,560
to get into variables in a lot more detail later.

69
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,840
So let's go myWindow, because that's what we called it, and lets type moveTo.

70
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,940
And let's just pick a random number. And now watch what happens when I push enter, or return.

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,420
Whoa, where did it go? 

72
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,150
Yep, there it is, so it moved the screen. 

73
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,870
So these are just some fun things you can play around with on the Window objects.

74
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,180
You know what else is really cool?

75
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,510
You can also navigate history.

76
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,020
So say we were on this page, and now I went to apple,

77
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,300
or lets say we were at google.

78
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,130
Now, let's say we navigated to apple.

79
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,880
OK. What we can do is access the window object.

80
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,890
And within that, there is history, the history object.

81
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,340
And we can go back and Bob's Your Uncle, we're back at, um, google. 

82
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,530
There's also location, you can see the current web page URL. 

83
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,380
So if we go window and we access its location object, and access href.

84
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,750
There we go. It tells you the page we're currently on. So you can see there is really awesome stuff

85
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,120
going on.

86
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,350
Yeah.

87
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:49,050
And I implore you, I encourage you to go and explore, feel free to Google some of the stuff and just

88
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,520
get familiar with the window object.

89
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,030
It's awesome.

90
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:51,750
Enjoy.
