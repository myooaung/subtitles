1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,540
We've got this far in the course without actually defining what JavaScript is.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,750
I'd like to say it's part of the three musketeers.

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,730
And what do I mean by that?

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,740
Let's think about what the three core elements of every single website are.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:17,880
Can you guess?

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,010
I'm sure you must know at least one of them.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,580
HTML, that provides the basic structure of a website.

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,820
CCS, is used for the presentation, formatting and layout.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,830
And of course, we've got JavaScript, which is used to control the behavior of the different elements

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,460
on the page.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,700
Now, I just want to go over each one individually in a little bit more detail to help you understand

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,740
the roles that each play on a website.

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,590
And then, once we understand that, I'll give you practical examples of how everything fits in. 

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,300
So let's start with a good old HTML. HTML,

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,170
it's at the core of every single page and this regardless of the complexity of the site or the number

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,140
of technologies involved in building that website.

17
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,120
And it's an essential skill for any web professional, and it's a starting point for anyone learning

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,460
how to create content on a website.

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,050
And luckily for you and I, HTML isn't that difficult to learn.

20
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,940
But let me break it up for you.

21
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,290
HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language".

22
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,050
What do we mean by "markup" language?

23
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:34,840
Well, rather than using a programming language to perform functions, HTML uses tags, aka: markups

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,450
to identify different types of content and the purposes that each serve to the webpage.

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,920
So these tags, these markups, have pretty intuitive names.

26
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,020
We've got the heading tags.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,770
We've got the paragraph tags, anchor tags, image tags.

28
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,810
I can keep going on and on ...

29
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:00,230
And every website, every web page is made up of a bunch of these HTML tags denoting each type of content

30
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,770
on the page.

31
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,120
Makes sense, right?

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,730
And each type of content on a page is wrapped by these HTML tags.
(swoosh sound)

33
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:17,010
So that's HTML. 
(swoosh then crash)
What do I mean by CSS? CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".

34
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,360
Think about it this way. The HTML provides the raw tools to structure content on a website.

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,320
CSS, on the other hand, helps to style this content, so it appears in a nice way.

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,100
It appears in a way that you and I intended to appear on the screen.

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,070
And these languages, HTML and CSS, they're kept separate from each other.

38
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,870
And that's to ensure the websites are built correctly before it's reformatted.

39
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,610
You could look at HTML as the drywall and CSS as the paint.

40
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,500
So all those colors and background images,

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,220
yep,

42
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,170
it's all thanks to CSS.

43
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,980
And CSS, this language, it affects the entire mood and tone of the websites, making it an incredibly

44
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,520
powerful.

45
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,850
And it's a very important skill for you and I to learn.

46
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,570
And remember what it stands for, it stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and what do we mean by "Style Sheets"?

47
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,150
Well, that refers to the document itself, and every web browser has a default style sheet.

48
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,930
Plus, every single web page has at least one style sheet, and this is awesome to understand.

49
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,410
So whether or not you've got a separate .css file, every single site has a default style sheet.

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,730
So for example, my browser's default font is Times New Roman.

51
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,490
So if I visit a website where the designer didn't apply 

52
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,770
any styles of their own, I will see (the font) Times New Roman.

53
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:47,230
But obviously, the vast majority of websites I visit don't have Times New Roman. That's because web designers

54
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:53,980
started off with a default style sheet, and then they overrode that with their own custom CSS.

55
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,460
And that's where the word "cascading" comes into play.

56
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,470
And a lot of people compare it to a waterfall.

57
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,070
You know, if you can imagine a huge waterfall,

58
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,920
you know, I'm in Africa, sitting at Victoria Falls,

59
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,530
you can just imagine this beautiful waterfall hitting rocks on the way down.

60
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:14,630
But only the rocks at the bottom effect where that water will eventually end up flowing.

61
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,529
And that's the same way with CCS.

62
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:24,860
It's only the last defined style sheet that informs my browser, which instructions rule over other

63
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,460
instructions.

64
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,940
And lastly, we have JavaScript okay, which is more complicated than HTML and CSS, and it wasn't released

65
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,620
until

66
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,890
also mid-90's.

67
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,260
And nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is used on almost every site on the

68
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,200
web. So, JavaScript is a logic based programming language that can be used to modify the content and make

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,370
it behave in different ways.

70
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,030
Easy examples are confirmation boxes.

71
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,360
You know, all those boxes that pop up on your screen.

72
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,510
A site that you've entered, where you see a login form, okay, and a confirmation box asking you to press OK

73
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,160
or Cancel.

74
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,450
That was made possible because of JavaScript.

75
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,060
What about call to actions? You know, when you're scrolling down a site on those annoying boxes pop

76
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,310
out to the left asking you to do something or buy a product or click something? Well, that's JavaScript.

77
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,400
What about storing information? When you fill out a form and you write your name, and you're name is Wally.

78
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,210
And at the end, you purchase a product and you get a message saying, "Thanks, Wally".

79
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,760
My friends, that is also JavaScript.

80
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:33,030
That is exactly how JavaScript is used on sites, and you can get very complicated with JavaScript.

81
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,610
It can be good for security.

82
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,960
You can make games with it.

83
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,400
You can create special effects with it. The list goes on.

84
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,380
Let me now give you a practical example of what JavaScript is and how it fits into a website.
