00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.800
Let's take a step back and just recap on what we've learnt.

2
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.690
We've created objects in different ways.

3
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.390
We use object literal syntax, object constructor syntax, object, create syntax and we used cluster

4
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.970
syntax.

5
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.570
We've seen that JavaScript objects are a standalone entity, and every single object holds properties

6
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.080
and methods.

7
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.110
And remember, object properties just stall key or name value pays.

8
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.910
And properties and methods can be accessed using the dot or the square bracket notation and objects

9
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.940
are so dynamic and JavaScript that you can even pass objects by reference from one function to another.

10
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.810
Whoa.

11
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.260
Whoa, whoa.

12
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.080
I actually don't think I showed you an example of that.

13
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.470
Let me quickly show, you know, JavaScript is so dynamic and you can work with objects and functions

14
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.350
in such a dynamic way, more so than other languages.

15
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.750
And one of the ways is that you can pass objects by reference into other functions.

16
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.740
Let me show you what I mean.

17
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.360
So when me say objects can be passed by reference?

18
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.890
Into functions and to start off, let's just define a function, and we're going to have a whole section

19
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.850
on functions, so don't worry if you don't understand the syntax yet, but hopefully you'll be able

20
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.450
to follow along.

21
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.290
Let's call this function change name and this change name needs to be passed the user object.

22
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.570
This isn't just a variable.

23
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.530
This is a whole object.

24
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.470
It's going to be passed through it.

25
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.970
And the user name is going to be changed to John Doe.

26
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.860
And this is us creating a function.

27
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.520
And now let us create a person and how shall we create an object?

28
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.320
We've got one of four ways, don't we?

29
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.170
Well, I'm just going to use object to draw syntax because it is the most simple a person equal, open

30
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.500
and close, curly braces, and this has not actually created a person object.

31
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.250
And it's just have one property, and that property will be a name value up and the property name will

32
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.700
be name.

33
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.870
It it sounds confusing.

34
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.440
We could say first name and we can make that Wally.

35
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.940
Now, if we console.log this out, we should see that object.

36
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.120
They need to start quicker.

37
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.520
You got because running, you can see when you console a dead person, it's got a first name of Wally.

38
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.640
And what happens if we want to change that name?

39
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.330
Well, we can pass it into that function and this is what I mean.

40
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.120
That objects can be passed by reference into another function.

41
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.160
We just have to create this if name has to be the same as what we've done here.

42
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.840
So let me show you how it works.

43
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.990
All we need to do is we need to call the function.

44
00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.300
And in this function, we are passing the person watching.

45
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.800
And now it's been done what his name is, change to John Doe.

46
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.060
Do you want to see?

47
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.140
Well, it's console.log up, person.

48
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.480
Now you got.

49
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.620
The first name is now John Doe.

50
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.350
Well, it's a double barrel, first name.

51
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.460
That's just what I mean by object can pass a reference into other functions.

52
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.500
Let's get back to the lecture.

53
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.550
OK, now that I showed you that example, I just want to stress this again with objects and the way

54
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.000
we create and there is no right way to create an object.

55
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.850
It's just going to have to come naturally to you.

56
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.850
The more you work with, the more you'll see where to use one object creation method over another.
