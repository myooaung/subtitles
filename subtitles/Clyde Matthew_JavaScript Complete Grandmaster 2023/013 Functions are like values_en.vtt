00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.590
This is just going to be a quick lecture, there's something I wanted to mention, and that is functions

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.300
in JavaScript are available.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.670
And what that means is that we can deal with them.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.540
And it sounds strange, but we can deal with them as a venue.

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.090
In all, I mean by that is you can throw functions around, you can force them into other functions,

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.630
you can assign them to variables.

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.530
And this makes functions in JavaScript also an unmatched because other languages aren't as flexible.

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.970
You can't do this with functions.

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.470
Let me show you what I mean.

10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.740
I'll just give you an example of us assigning a function, each a variable.

11
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.390
Well, we can define any function.

12
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.090
We want solicitous work with a function declaration, which is very easy and intuitive to do this.

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.060
An excuse function look.

14
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.130
And this is just going to console.log Wolf.

15
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.620
Nothing new there.

16
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.000
But now we can treat this function as a value and assign it.

17
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.720
To another variable, how awesome is this, so we can literally go let.

18
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.470
Sausage dog, equal dog.

19
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.360
And now at this point in time, Sausage Dog has been assigned the value of that function.

20
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.330
So to execute this, to invoke our function.

21
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.730
We use the normal parentheses.

22
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.320
So let's exercise our sausage dog.

23
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.200
And execute it.

24
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.840
There you go to console logs, Wolf.

25
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.870
And of course, we've got the sausage dog, but we also have our dog function, which we can execute

26
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.790
and that also executes wolf to the console.

27
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.630
And there you have it.

28
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.310
I just wanted to show you this before we move on because I know this might seem simple, but it has

29
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.740
profound impacts on you and I as developers, because JavaScript is awesome like this.

30
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.500
It allows us so much flexibility to work with functions and throw them around and put them into variables.

31
00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.790
It really is great.

32
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.480
So before we went on to more complicated things, I just wanted to share this with you.
