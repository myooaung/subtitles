00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.490
So, many people think JavaScript is a bad language and that we only need it because it's built into all

2
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.970
browsers.

3
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.660
Let's call these people ... I dunno ...
(loud buzzer)

4
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:29.140
WRONG! JavaScript is an awesome language, and you literally have tech companies, giant tech companies all

5
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.640
around the world spending millions of dollars to create very fast JavaScript interpreters.

6
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.930
And what that means is that we can have fast JavaScript runtime environments.

7
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.180
What's really cool is that now you can use JavaScript on the back-end,

8
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.510
Okay. Up until about 10 years ago, JavaScript was very much predominantly just a frontend language.

9
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:59.750
And then new web development techniques called AJAX came along and AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And

10
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.290
XML.

11
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.780
And in a nutshell, all that AJAX is, is it's using JavaScript in the backend via a markup language called XML

12
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.600
to make a web page more responsive.

13
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.730
What do I mean by responsive?

14
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.230
Well, think about loading new content on a web page, but without making that refresh.

15
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.930
Examples?

16
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.080
Think about Gmail and how it loads your emails or think about Twitter, how it loads new tweets.

17
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.540
It's very responsive and very quick.

18
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:39.670
And get this. This extra added functionality started to make JavaScript (explosive sound) explode. In the past few years,

19
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.680
we've seen an insane development in JavaScript.

20
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.470
INSANE. The JavaScript

21
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:54.620
JSON file format is pretty much used now to transfer data all over the web. Node.js, which is a backend

22
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.220
JavaScript server, can now be used to create servers. 

23
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.740
You've got JavaScript libraries like mastache and handlebars that can create JavaScript templates

24
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.300
in a very easy and intuitive way.

25
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.060
You've got frameworks like Ember, Angular,

26
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.800
Backbone, etc.

27
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.610
All of these frameworks are used to create thousands of crazy interactive websites. And these frameworks,

28
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.660
this language, this JavaScript language, has literally

29
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.680
pushed the limits of JavaScript

30
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.860
way beyond what anyone thought was possible.

31
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.700
Let's just put all of this aside for the moment.

32
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.720
JavaScript is powerful, but it can be difficult to learn. It can be difficult to learn any programming language

33
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.430
if you've had no experience before.

34
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.080
But the good news is that a lot of these languages all have the same logic. Loops, tables, arrays,

35
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.800
functions, scopes, execution context ...

36
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.310
they all kind of have similar terminology.

37
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.110
And once you get it for one language, it makes learning another language just so much easier.

38
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.450
And JavaScript, because it's so powerful, is an awesome first language to begin with.

39
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.550
So this section is a crash course in JavaScript.

40
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.290
It's kind of just setting your mind right into understanding how HTML, CSS and JavaScript fit in with each other.

41
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.880
We are going to get into coding in this course. We're going to get into a lot of coding, but you do

42
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.290
need to understand the fundamentals first and trust me, it makes coding more fun.

43
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.250
It makes it more intuitive. 

44
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.050
You know, I hate, for me personally, I hate just rote learning, you know, learning how to, you know, just

45
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.950
memorizing words.

46
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.390
I need to understand. I need to understand what's going on in the background, and it'll make you much better programmer

47
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.870
and it'll make your life of programming a lot more fun.

48
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.930
So that's what this section is about. It's just setting the mood.

49
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.600
Enjoy, sit back and just try and soak in and understand how JavaScript fits in. Enjoy.
