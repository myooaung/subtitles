00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.370
Remember how when we create in a raid automatically came with a whole lot of properties and methods

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.600
attached to it automatically.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.960
Remember, we had the pop and we had the push and we had the links.

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.020
Well, let me just say that array methods can be grouped into three broad categories, and it's very

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.910
important for you to distinguish between it.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.430
Otherwise, you might mess up your code and your daughter.

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.010
So the three broad categories are mutate to excess and iterated.

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:32.610
Mutated methods of those that mutate will alter the original array, so be very careful when working

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.050
with mutated methods.

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.500
Because what you do on that array will affect the original array.

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.390
You've got excess methods and they don't alter that right.

12
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.310
Doesn't mutate the original array.

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.690
It only creates a copy.

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.520
And then you can work with that copy and extract and do with that copy as you please.

15
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.930
And then finally, you've got iterations.

16
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.890
So a lot of the time with Dot, you actually wanting to loop through that dot, you wanting to extract

17
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.900
certain values and display it to use it?

18
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.030
It's we iterate has come into the picture.

19
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.739
Let's look at examples.

20
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.210
All three of these types of methods be.
