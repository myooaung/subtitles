00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:09.040
Remember, at the beginning, I said that the inbuilt JavaScript alert() function is a system object, meaning

2
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.510
we can't change its layout?

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.670
So then how do we get really cool JavaScript alert tabs showing up?

4
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.570
Well, I'm not going to use plugins, because this course is about teaching you JavaScript. And let's

5
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.350
just create one.

6
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.960
Let's create one ourselves with vanilla

7
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.290
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

8
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.350
So as always, let's start with an HTML document.

9
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.910
And let's create a button.

10
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.790
And now let's create an onclick function, and let's say that

11
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.110
its called alertMe(). And you can see on the right, we've got our button here "Click me". 

12
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.300
But of course, nothing happens when we click it.

13
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.030
Now, before we get into the JavaScript, I actually want to create what the alert will look like. And

14
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.220
how I like thinking of it, is lets create a div, a div tag that contains our entire alert.

15
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.660
And then within that div tag, I just want to have a heading, lets say "This is a warning message". And then

16
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.600
I want a button that the user can click OK.

17
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.210
So let's do that.

18
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.070
Let's have a div tag and let's say it has an "id" of

19
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.210
confirm. This is going to be the whole tag containing the alert. Then I want the heading. Let's have another 

20
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.000
div, and let's say that's just the message.

21
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.170
The class message.

22
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.790
This is a warning message.

23
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.440
And then let's have a button.

24
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.960
Let's just say, class is "yes". 

25
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.880
I don't know why, 

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.870
you can say anything.

27
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:07.700
If I save that, it just looks like "gubbelyGoo" on the Web page. There is our message. There is our Ok button. Again

28
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:08.960
it does nothing.

29
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.250
Now, before we do JavaScript, I just want to style this warning message quickly. And

30
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.340
I know this is not good practice, but I'm just going to put the style in the head.

31
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.750
I don't want to create external stylesheets and all that now.

32
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.370
We can just do it together quickly.

33
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.600
So what should we do first?

34
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.350
Well, let's do this entire div first.

35
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.130
So this is just using our standard CSS styling techniques, I'm identifying the id of "confirm" and now

36
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.330
we can style it together.

37
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.120
Let's display it as a block.

38
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.220
Let's put a background

39
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.170
color of

40
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.760
I dunno,

41
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.480
58, 58, 58.

42
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.870
There you go, starting to see some results.

43
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.260
Position: fixed.
Border

44
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.550
Let's do 2 pixels, solid red.

45
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.160
Just showing you kind of how this thing is being made up.

46
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.440
Let's put this in the center.

47
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.200
Let's make it a bit wider.

48
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.240
It's a bit far to the right, so let's just push it left a little bit.

49
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.460
Margin-left,

50
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.230
I know this is not the most ideal way to do things, but I'm just trying to get the job done to show you

51
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.250
kind of hard it work's.

52
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.500
And now let's just put some padding.

53
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.820
And let's align the text to the center. 

54
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.640
There you go. It's getting there. It's getting there. I can kind of feel the vibe.

55
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.920
Let's now style this warning message. 

56
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.590
What did we call it? We called it "message". 

57
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.899
Let's make it a white color, so we can actually read it. 

58
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.500
And what else do we need?

59
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.390
We need, it needs margin, it looks terrible. Magin-top,

60
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.490
margin-bottom,

61
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.760
that should ...

62
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:40.720
not working ... margin-top, margin-bottom, you see, its starting to look much better. And then lastly, 

63
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.000
let's style this OK button because it looks terrible.

64
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.010
So again, what we call that? We called that a "button".

65
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.740
Confirm, and then it's a button.

66
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.610
What should we do with that?

67
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.950
Let's do a background-color

68
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.290
rgb

69
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.350
It's going to look hideous.

70
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.540
So let's changes its color.

71
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.380
Maybe we do a nice red.

72
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.110
Let's don't have exactly square borders. 

73
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.150
It doesn't look that nice, in my opinion.

74
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:37.150
Slightly rounded edges- probably don't even see it, but it's a nice, subtle improvement on design.

75
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.860
We can now do a border.

76
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.510
It's looking already a bit better.

77
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.180
The margin-bottom needs a bit of work.

78
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.830
Margin-bottom.

79
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.990
There you go.

80
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.240
And the other thing I want to show you, is

81
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.420
when my mouse hovers over the OK, I want it to become a pointer. So quickly lets do that. 

82
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.770
Cursor

83
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.460
pointer.

84
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.820
Now, when I hover over it, it becomes a pointer so you know its a button. Cool hey.

85
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.170
Let's make it a bit wider.

86
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.500
Maybe a bit less.

87
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.990
This just add some padding.

88
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.090
OK, so I say it's looking good.

89
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.960
I say that's looking like, let me just pull this in a bit, 

90
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.910
I say that's looking like a nice alert tab - way better than the other pop up that we saw. And you can design these

91
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.250
things however you like, I've just done a really rough job.

92
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.320
Now, let's add JavaScript, okay let's JavaScript. Let's go to the top,

93
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.600
remember JavaScript has to be within script tags.

94
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.960
And where should we put it?

95
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.680
And where should we put it?

96
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.990
Let's put it at the top here, let's put it at the very top. Okay, script

97
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.210
script.

98
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.620
Let's hide this whole confirmation warning box.

99
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.900
So at the moment, we've got 'display:block". Let's just go "display:none", and we should see that disappear. 

100
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.350
But when we click this button, we want to see it.

101
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:40.110
Well, the first thing we need to do, is we need to start creating a function for when this button is clicked,

102
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.430
right?

103
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.890
If we look down and we just scroll down to the bottom of the code, you can see this button has

104
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.840
a function that we've called alertMe().

105
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.000
We need to now define that function in JavaScript.

106
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.540
Otherwise, nothing happens, which is what's happening here.

107
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.790
So let's start defining a function called alertMe().

108
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.290
Function alertMe.

109
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.430
And what do we want to happen?

110
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.710
Well, the first thing we want to happen is we want to display an error message. And in order to do that,

111
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:20.910
we've got to identify that whole div tag that has that whole alert, which we defined with an id of "confirm". 

112
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:28.150
So let's call it confirmBox, for lack of a better word,  document,

113
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.040
remember, it's your web page.,

114
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.820
JavaScript has an inbuilt method called getElementById().

115
00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:40.039
And we called the id "confirm". 

116
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.830
So now we've got it.

117
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:52.140
Then the second thing we want to do is, you know when that alert is open, there is that OK button. 

118
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.720
We want to identify the OK button because when that 

119
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.710
OK button is clicked, we want that modal,

120
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.370
or that popup alert, to disappear.

121
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.970
That's the second thing we to do. Let 

122
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:10.960
okayButton equal document getElementsByClassName. What class name did we call that again? We called

123
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.300
it

124
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:11.890
"yes".

125
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:21.680
Now, if we just left it at this, it's actually going to return ... when you find an element by getElementsByClassName, it returns 

126
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.660
what's called a "NodeList".

127
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.630
And it's almost like an Array like object.

128
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.000
So this isn't quite enough.

129
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.550
We've just got to access the first element of that array.

130
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:38.020
Which is what that is doing there. Now that we have this OK button, what we want to do is we

131
00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:44.650
want to define an onclick event, that when the user clicks on that OK button, that whole dialog box

132
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:45.220
disappears.

133
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.510
So let's do that.

134
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:56.640
And let me add comments here, and we went through comments. This is the button within the 

135
00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:57.220
alert modal.

136
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.320
And now we want

137
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.700
to hide the alert modal when the button is clicked. 

138
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.370
So let's do that. So let's add

139
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.210
an event listener

140
00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:25.990
onclick. So, okayButton.onclick, and here we have to define a function again.

141
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.640
And let's do it all in one step.

142
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.820
And you'll see later, we actually don't have to write out this big keyword,

143
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.540
there's a shorter way to do it, which is new syntax, I'll teach you that later. 

144
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.300
I just want you to understand what it is we're doing here.

145
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:48.510
Then another inbuilt method within the browser and JavaScript and DOM is setAttribute.

146
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.380
You can literally change attributes of different elements in your page.

147
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:58.100
So let's grab that confirm box which we've defined above, and we can set an attribute. And what

148
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:03.680
attribute to we want to set? Well remember, we want it to be displayed now as "none" when the button is clicked.

149
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.470
With the setAttribute, we wanna make the "style" as the first argument to this method,

150
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:14.210
and the second one is what we want to change, and that is "display: none". 

151
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.260
Simple, right?

152
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:22.500
So now we've defined what happens with the button within the alert modal, but we haven't actually shown

153
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.320
the modal anyway, so we can't do anything with it.

154
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.340
Well, let's just put it up here and say show modal.

155
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.350
We can write confirmBox

156
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.820
setAttribute

157
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.530
we wanna effect the "style"

158
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.930
and we want to display

159
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.340
to be block.

160
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.410
Should we give it a go?

161
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.170
Should we test our code? Let's see if it works.

162
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.310
Click the button.

163
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:54.860
Huh.

164
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.110
What's gone wrong here?

165
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.350
alertMe why is this not working when I go click.

166
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:09.360
alertMe ... so something we can check is if we console.log, here, we can log "hi", to see if the

167
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.860
click event is working. And let's just go to the console.

168
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.190
And let's click the button, you can see nothing's happening.

169
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.950
So obviously, this alertMe function is not being called. The question is why? 

170
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.530
It's all done in ...

171
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.690
Ahh ... onlick. It should be on ...

172
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.070
CLICK.

173
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.140
Let's check if that works now.

174
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.790
Click me. There's our "hi", and there is our warning.

175
00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.530
Okay, great.

176
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:51.140
So let me hide that. Let me delete that, refresh the page,   when I click, it comes up.

177
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:57.020
We've identified this okayButton so when I click OK, it's going to execute this function,

178
00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.260
which says I want to set the attribute to "display: none".

179
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:02.790
And it disappears.

180
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:11.360
So this is really an example of how we've created an alert from scratch from literally scratch. From using HTML

181
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.190
CSS and a bit of JavaScript, and we've literally created our own custom designed alert.

182
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:17.450
This is awesome.

183
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.490
And this is going to set you on the path to being an awesome programmer. Let's continue.
