1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,980
I'm getting confused.

3
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,390
Let's just take a step back.

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,700
So the process of converting your source code to machine code has to happen, somehow.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,140
And it's just a question of how much of this happens on your machine when you're coding versus how much

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,180
of it happens on the other uses machine, and that determines whether it's compiled versus interpreted.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,780
For example, C, C++, Objective-C,

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:29,220
these are all typically found as compiled languages, so you need a compiler installed. And the compiler

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,690
can be downloaded for free, but they're often built into IDEs.

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,510
The good news and I've mentioned this before, is that JavaScript is an interpreted language. But now

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,660
you are well on your way to understanding different types of languages.

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,010
How JavaScript fits in.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,410
Why JavaScript is such a powerful language in terms of how its converted into machine code.

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,660
And with that said, let's move on.
