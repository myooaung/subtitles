1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,800
And I've mentioned that objects are a whole bunch of name value pairs.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:11,190
I just want to stress this point again and drive it home and name an event and the name in the video

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,170
separated by column.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,610
You've got your name on the left colon and your value on the right.

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,350
Let me give you an example.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,060
And our member lives at 100 main unit three one on the third floor.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,920
The address is the name and the actual location, the is the venue.

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,180
And again, it's separated by column, but we can represent this in another way.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,850
You might want to separate it out.

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,510
What I mean?

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,320
Let me show you.

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,790
Let's take the address.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,280
Let's open up a new object.

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,580
And now in the JavaScript engine sees those curly braces.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,400
It's not an operator.

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,240
It's going to assume that that is an object.

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,390
So the address is going to be the name and the venue is going to be that entire object.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,890
So let's separate it up the street as main.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,840
Again, that's a name and a value.

20
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,720
Now we just put a comma in.

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,590
We've got no.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,180
Which is the name.

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,880
Colon and then the value, which in this case is 100.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,610
We can keep going on, but now we've got a unit.

25
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,790
This is another point I wanted to stress we can actually have nested objects and name value within an

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,180
object.

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,590
Yeah, we've got the floor third floor.

28
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,750
And then number three, oh, one again, Unity's name.

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,120
And that entire object is the value.

30
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,160
I hope this is starting to make sense.

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,640
It's just name value pays.

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,200
Let's move on.
