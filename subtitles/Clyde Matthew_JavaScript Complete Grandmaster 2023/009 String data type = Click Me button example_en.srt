The most popular data type in JavaScript is arguably a String.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:10,450
So let me just show you a practical example of how we can work with this specific data type in JavaScript.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,670
We've already seen lots of it because we used alerts, console logs, 

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,140
we've done count methods,

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,800
we've done a lot. And all of those (methods) take Strings.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,050
They take text.

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,860
Here's another example.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,660
Here's an HTML file.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,100
Let's just insert a button.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,119
I dunno, called "click me", and I'm not going to worry about CSS right now making it look pretty,

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,830
I just want to illustrate JavaScript.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,370
So here we got a button.

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,770
We click it, nothing happens.

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:43,340
What if we want an alert, and we pass a string data type into that alert 

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,850
once you click the button? Well, it's very easy.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,110
All you need to do is add what's called a click event listener on this button. 

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,670
So that's onClick.

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,880
And we want to fire a function, let's call it

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,960
alert, alertMe() function. 

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:08,620
All this is saying is that we've added an event onto the button called "onClick". When you click it, 

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,060
it's going to fire this function called alertMe(). What do you think's going to happen?

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,150
Well, nothing because we haven't defined what this alertMe() function is, and that is where JavaScript

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:19,510
comes in.

24
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,020
If we're now in JavaScript (tab), we can go,

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,190
function alertMe(), 

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,510
and we can say, let's give an alert.

27
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:34,000
This is a string data type in JavaScript.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,030
There you go.

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,870
Now it works.

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,540
This is a string data type in JavaScript.

31
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,200
Button works.

32
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,230
How cool is that?

33
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:52,160
Just bear in mind here, because we're using JSBin, it automatically makes the link between HTML and

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,820
JavaScript.

35
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,530
In practice, you would have to include a script tag say here,

36
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,430
and you'd have to have the source attribute, etc etc.

37
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,990
We just haven't done that because we are working on an online console.

38
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,699
Hope it helps.
