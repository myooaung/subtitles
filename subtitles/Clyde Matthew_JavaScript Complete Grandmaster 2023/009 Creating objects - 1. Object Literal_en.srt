1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,390
For example, number one, this just make it the most simple.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,820
It's creates an empty object.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,070
Remember how to define an object literal?

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,180
Leonid is an opening and closing curly it.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,970
It's all we've done, and that is literally now an object, if I console.log that out, we get an empty

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,150
object, which is what the blue?

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,230
OK?

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,450
What about creating an object with one property?

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,320
So let's create this object.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,060
One property?

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,760
The dog equal.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,150
Opening and closing curly brackets defines an object.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,910
It say it has a name, and it said the name is.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,190
Wolfie.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,920
So now we've defined an object and object with one property, and removal of properties are just key

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,700
value pairs.

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,570
Yeah, the keys name and the venue is Wolfie.

18
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,310
Console.log, they wrote.

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,459
We get our object.

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,260
But let me emphasize something here.

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,090
You do have to specify the key and a value in order for this to work.

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,880
Otherwise, you will be thrown in error and we give you an example.

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,410
So you have to specify both key and value.

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,750
So yeah, if I go a late animal.

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,640
Equals type, and I just leave it.

26
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:34,540
I get an error as this type is not defined, so I have to assign it value.

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,340
So let me say mammal now I don't get any errors in even making it more simple than that.

28
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,450
And also, if I go late animal to.

29
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,700
And I go just type.

30
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,580
The same thing happens as this type is not defined.

31
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,270
So you see, I have to specify both in order for this code to be valid.

32
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's just delete these quickly.

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,810
What about methods using object neutral syntax?

34
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,610
Let's just create an object with one method.

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,259
And let's just call it welcome it, say you want to give a welcome message to a user welcome message

36
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,440
open and close curly brackets defines an object.

37
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,480
JavaScript knows this is now an object.

38
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,630
Now it's the teacher method and it's cool.

39
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,140
The method.

40
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,610
Say hi.

41
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,320
And this method will be a function, and method just means a function, by the way a function is outside

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,780
of an object and a method is inside of an object, that the same thing.

43
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,600
And let's say we have to take it to this function as an argument, and we're going to be getting into

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,310
functions in one of the upcoming sections.

45
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,780
So don't panic if you don't know what I mean.

46
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,970
And it's just console.

47
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,110
Log the text up to the screen and to make it more clear, just one comments.

48
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,180
So you understand what we're doing.

49
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,690
This is an object with one method.

50
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,050
Now this access this method, welcome message.

51
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,800
Dutch remember, that's how we access methods and properties, say, hi, what we've called it, and

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,150
it needs to be passed a stream.

53
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,180
So let's say hello.

54
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,440
And there you have it, console.log hello to the screen.

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,760
Okay, but up until now, we've just been dealing with properties or we've just been dealing with methods.

56
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,160
What about if we combine properties and methods?

57
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:23,810
No problem.

58
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:31,430
So this object with properties and methods, so let's define a person object and this person has a first

59
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,760
name.

60
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,380
This person has a property called age.

61
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,270
And it's say there's a message method.

62
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,440
And let's say this method just console logs.

63
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,040
This first name so that we collide is.

64
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,740
This age is old.

65
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,430
So there you have it.

66
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,130
We have a person object with properties and those properties of key value pays.

67
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:22,120
And we've also included a message method that's trying to access that person message.

68
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,170
We execute.

69
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,260
And as soon as we do, that executes the function.

70
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,830
I hope you're starting to get a bit more comfortable with objects and how we create them in JavaScript.

71
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,230
But don't get too complacent yet because this was only one way to create an object.

72
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,910
Now let's discuss another.
