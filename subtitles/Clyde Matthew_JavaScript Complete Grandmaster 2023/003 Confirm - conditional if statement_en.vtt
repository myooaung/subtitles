00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.450
We've seen alerts.

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.700
Now let's look at another JavaScript function.

3
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.810
A confirmation.

4
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.540
Again, let's start with a simple HTML page.

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.480
Let's have a button.

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.520
This time onclick let's say getConfirmation() function, which we still need to define in JavaScript.

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.310
So let's now define this getConfirmation function.

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.910
We've gotta include JavaScript within script tags. 

9
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.820
We've gotta tell JavaScript we're defining a function with the "function" keyword, getConfirmation. 

10
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.430
I've typed "confirm" on the screen - where did that come from? Well, that is just a JavaScript function.

11
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.500
I mean, these JavaScript functions

12
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.910
you'll just learn as a programmer over time, you'll just start remembering what these function names

13
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.040
are.

14
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.060
But this one is called "confirm", so I haven't coded anything around confirm - this is inbuilt.

15
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.770
And let's just ask the user, do you want to continue?

16
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.050
Shall we give this a go

17
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.830
and see what happens?

18
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.300
So we should see a button.

19
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.480
When we click the button, which should be displayed with a confirmation dialog box.

20
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.690
Confirm button.

21
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.710
Ah, let me just get rid of that semicolon.

22
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.510
This is not JavaScript, this is just HTML. There is the Confirm button. When I click it, 

23
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.330
"Do you want to continue?"

24
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.630
And it's literally asking me, OK or Cancel.

25
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.760
But now if I click OK or Cancel, nothing happens. Let's try and figure out

26
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.490
how to code something if I click OK?

27
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.600
How would we do that?

28
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.170
Let's go back to the code.

29
00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:03.200
We've got this confirm dialog box, and what JavaScript does is we can actually store the OK variable,

30
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.530
the outcome of whether the user clicks OK or Cancel, into a variable. 

31
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.230
And we're going to get into variables in the very next section so hold tight.

32
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.240
It just means a container of where we can store information.

33
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.230
So let's stored it in a variable called, um, decision.

34
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.490
So the users decision is going to be stored, and that value will depend on whether they've

35
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.600
clicked yes (OK) or no (Cancel).

36
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.590
And now we can code something. Let's code something with an IF statement and again, IF statements

37
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.440
we're going to get into later.

38
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.060
I just want you to get a feel for how we can start working with these kind of JavaScript events.

39
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.140
And before I finish coding here, remember how we've been through the different data types in JavaScript.

40
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.650
And this is why data-types are important. This confirm dialog box, if the user clicks yes (OK), it returns

41
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.040
true, and if the user clicks no (Cancel), it returns false.

42
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.310
This is just how JavaScript has built this function into its code.

43
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.370
So what we can say, is we can say if the decision equals true,

44
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.600
let's document.write the user

45
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.940
wants to continue.
Else,

46
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.190
and this is if the decision is false,

47
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.080
let's write,

48
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.340
the user is scared and does not want to continue.

49
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.740
I hope even though you don't fully understand the syntax yet, you can kind of see, you can kind of follow

50
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.820
what it is I'm trying to do.

51
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.060
The first thing we've done is we've created a button and that button does nothing until the user clicks

52
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.160
it.

53
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.130
That's what this "onclick" means. When onclick is ... clicked, when that event is fired, the parser is going

54
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.330
to see this function, getConfirmation, and it's going to then find this function,

55
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.040
It's going to know it's JavaScript

56
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.090
because we've put it in the script tag.

57
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.080
It's going to find that getConfirmation function and execute it.

58
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.860
It's going to say, okay cool, let decision equals confirm

59
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.970
Do you want to continue?

60
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.529
When it sees the confirm, it knows that that's a function, so it's going to execute it.

61
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.600
And then if the user clicks yes (OK), it's going to return a true boolean, and we're going to write this

62
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.200
to the screen.

63
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.000
And if the user clicks Cancel, it's going to be false.

64
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.550
So this isn't going to be true and then this will be displayed on the screen.

65
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.450
Let's see it in action.

66
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:44.020
So there's our Confirm button. Click it. Do you want to continue? Let's say no. The user is scared, and does not

67
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.860
want to continue.

68
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.550
Perfect.

69
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.900
Let's refresh the page.

70
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.390
Let's try again.

71
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.320
Click the button. Let's say OK ... the user wants to continue. It works.

72
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.210
I hope you're getting a feel for this,

73
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.160
how cool it is and awesome and intuitive.

74
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.120
Let's continue.
