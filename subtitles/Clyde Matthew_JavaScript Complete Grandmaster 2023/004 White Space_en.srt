1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,420
Whitespace, what do I mean by whitespace?

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,420
Well, I mean, spaces and tabs.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,300
Do you think JavaScript cares about that?

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,960
Well, let's have a look.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:18,280
So let's define a variable called myName, and you can see we've got whitespace before and after the

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,940
equals sign.

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,950
What about a tab?

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,180
Let's try that.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,200
What about a whole new line entirely?

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,740
let myName = newline Clyde.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,140
Yes, it looks terrible

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,640
but will this work from a JavaScript point of view? And the short answer is ... yes.

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:44,040
Under all three of those scenarios, if you had to console.log myName, you would get the correct result.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,550
You would get a string with an output "Clyde".

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,450
So the good news is that JavaScript, like most modern languages, does not care about whitespace.

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,190
The interpreter automatically reformats all the whitespace.
