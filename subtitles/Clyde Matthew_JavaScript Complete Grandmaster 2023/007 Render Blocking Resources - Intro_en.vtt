00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.950
Key to understanding how to improve your code and your site's performance is understanding, render

2
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.800
blocking resources by default.

3
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.780
CCS is treated as a render blocking resource.

4
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.600
But what I mean by arena blocking, what does it mean?

5
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.830
We're very simplistic.

6
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:35.120
It just means that the browser won't render it won't process any content until the case is constructed.

7
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.700
It almost means that the entire process is put on hold until the case is on has been fully constructed,

8
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.890
that the case is style sheets have been read through by the Brasa and a whole tree has been constructed

9
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.640
on the back of that.

10
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.580
Until that's done, everything else is put on pause.

11
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.390
Because of this, you should always just make sure you keep your seat is lean and deliver it as quickly

12
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.560
as possible to the browser.

13
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.390
So that's why we use media types and queries to unblock rendering.

14
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.180
In the previous sections, we saw that in the construction of the industry that the critical rendering

15
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.000
path requires both the Dome and the season on to construct the industry.

16
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.710
Remember, it requires these two things and this has one very important implication and that is drum

17
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.040
roll.

18
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.440
Both HMO and CCS are render blocking resources.

19
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.570
It may seem obvious that HDMI laws are in the blocking because without the Dom, there be nothing to

20
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.250
display, but it might not be that obvious in relation to the CCS.

21
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.320
OK, but what does this all mean?

22
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.630
Well, let's look at the case first.

23
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.590
If CCS is not in the blocking, so let's just say that the browser takes your content to mobile and

24
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.760
it displays it on the screen very quickly, and it doesn't even wait for the case is to load.

25
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.610
Well, this is what the site's going to look like.

26
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.600
It's going to look terrible.

27
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.200
Jackie.

28
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.320
Which is why it's good to actually have rain, the blocking resources, sometimes you wanted it as a

29
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.910
developer, right?

30
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.940
You want to have a nice site that's displayed to users full of content in this case is all done.

31
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.000
Cool.

32
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.010
It was a very high level summary of what a render blocking resource is.

33
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.250
But now let's dive into this further.

34
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.230
And just in case you wondering, how do we actually see a website that doesn't have any access?

35
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.970
Well, turns out it is super simple.

36
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.600
Let's have a look.

37
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.610
Let's just go to some random websites.

38
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.270
I don't know.

39
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.080
It's just going to navigate.

40
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.180
Stack Overflow.

41
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.050
So, yeah, we are we are on Stack Overflow.

42
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.780
What if this is wasn't green the blocking?

43
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.010
What would this look like?

44
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.510
Well, you can quickly just go to the DevTools so we can expect this page.

45
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.410
And usually the case is always kept in the hip section.

46
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.420
I'll zoom in there for you so you can see usually the is within this head section.

47
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.620
And if we open this up here, we can see here the link at risk takes.

48
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.520
Yes, this isn't really CCS, but if we keep scrolling down, we should be able to find CCS some way.

49
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.690
And then we go, but it takes less cases.

50
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.380
So the point I'm trying to make is that if we delete this entire head, thank you, we go.

51
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.400
We get rid of all the cases, and that's why it looks a complete mess.

52
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.630
Yeah, but there you go.

53
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.730
Just in case you're wondering how I actually did that.

54
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.570
Now, you know.
