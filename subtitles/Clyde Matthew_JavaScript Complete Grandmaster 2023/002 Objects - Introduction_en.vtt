00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.790
Woo hoo.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.950
We are getting into objects, this is a massive section.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.920
Very, very important for you to understand.

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.920
So I'm excited.

5
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.510
Let's start getting through it.

6
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.810
Remember a while ago we see a the 2.2 types and JavaScript simple and complex.

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.670
And because the programming community want to intimidate all of us, they term it primitive and objects.

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.600
So what is objects?

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.110
This is the whole point of this section.

10
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.170
Let's step back and Google JavaScript.

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.640
Guess what comes up?

12
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:43.360
On the front page, it says JavaScript is an object oriented computer programming language, and this

13
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.210
brings us onto objects.

14
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.830
Programming is obsessed with objects.

15
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.870
Professional programming languages use a style of programming known as boot or object oriented programming.

16
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.130
So what is an object?

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.879
An object could be a garden, a house, a brick, a car could be a button on your web page.

18
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.630
Sometimes it's actually easier to ask what is not an object?

19
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.730
And the answer is not much.
