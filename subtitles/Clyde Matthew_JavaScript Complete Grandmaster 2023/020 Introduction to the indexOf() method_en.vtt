00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.710
Another very incredible function in JavaScript is known as this indexOf() function, and what does it

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.150
do? Well at the very basic level,

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.430
it tells you if a given item can be found in an array or a string.

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.580
The indexOf() method was added to the 

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.200
ECMA-262nd Standard, in the fifth edition.

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.810
Ah, what that means is that it was just added on December 3rd of 2009.

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.549
So what I'm trying to say is you don't have to worry about browsers not incorporating this method.

8
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.360
Every browser today will allow you to use the indexOf method.

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.710
OK, great Clyde,

10
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.880
all browsers can accept it

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.100
but what does it look like when we start using it?

12
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.420
Well, firstly, you call the indexOf method by typing its words,

13
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.020
its keywords "indexOf". It then takes two arguments.

14
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.600
The first argument is the search item, a.k.a. the item you want to search for, and the second argument

15
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.230
is optional.

16
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.750
It's the starting point of your search.

17
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.590
Don't worry, we're going to be seeing examples of this shortly.

18
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.150
So there you go.

19
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.250
That's kind of what it looks like high level.

20
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.310
And as I mentioned, we're going to be looking at examples. But before we do, there is something very important

21
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.300
you need to understand.

22
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.910
And that is, this indexOf() method only exists for two data types in JavaScript. And the first data

23
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.920
type that it exists on is ... Arrays.

24
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.680
What is an Array? In JavaScript an Array is just a single variable that is used to store different elements.

25
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.640
And bear in mind, the JavaScript Array is a global object, meaning you can kind of access it from

26
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.570
anywhere you like.

27
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.190
But enough talk. I actually wanna jump over to our text editor

28
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.130
and I wanna start coding Arrays with you, and I want to start looking at this indexOf() method, specifically

29
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.760
on Arrays.

30
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.490
Let's jump over to the console and let's start playing around.
