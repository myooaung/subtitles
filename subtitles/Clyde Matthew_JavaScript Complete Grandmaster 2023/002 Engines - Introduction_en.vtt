00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.460
We're just going to talk about engines very quickly. We know JavaScript was initially created to make

2
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.840
web pages alive, to add awesome dynamic elements to a web page.

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.270
As we continue with these sections and lectures, we're going to be getting deeper and deeper into JavaScript.

4
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.810
We're going to be understanding more of what it does and how it works.

5
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.450
So when we write JavaScript, we typically write what are called "programs".

6
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.130
Think about programs as a paragraph.

7
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:39.180
In JavaScript, we write a script and these scripts can be written in the HTML directly. And scripts

8
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.270
are just plain text, nothing scary.

9
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.500
We've already seen some of it, how it was written.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.830
But the thing with these scripts is that these scripts can only run directly on the browser.

11
00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.360
(explosion sound)
And this, my friends, means that there's some program written on the browser, an engine that's running

12
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.730
that JavaScript code. And this is what I quickly 

13
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.640
wanna lay out for you in simple layman's terms.
