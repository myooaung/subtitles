00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.100
Let's now look at some JavaScript prompts.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.440
We've looked at alerts, we've looked to confirmations.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.370
Now let's look at prompts. Again

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.770
we start with an HTML5 document.

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:21.310
And we can do this many ways again, but let's just do an input for now, and we'll do an onclick 

6
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.500
promptMe function.

7
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.430
So we've got our button, but now when the browser comes to execute a function called promptMe, 

8
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.530
it's not going to find it. Which is why we gotta write JavaScript. 

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.970
Our function keyword we've called it promptMe.

10
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.490
And now let's issue a JavaScript prompt. It really isn't difficult, you'll see now. So with the keyword

11
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.940
prompt,

12
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.920
you write your message.

13
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.820
How many warthogs do you have?

14
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.400
And then here you can just give a little, um, 

15
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:19.160
placeholder, like little hint and say, enter number of warthogs here. 

16
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.530
Let's see what this looks like.

17
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.970
Let me just close these other tabs.

18
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.820
I keep forgetting this is not JavaScript, and I keep putting semi-colons here. 

19
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.330
This is just HTML. So "Prompt me please". 

20
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.960
Here's our button.

21
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.070
Click the button.

22
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.630
How many 

23
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.110
warthogs do you

24
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.480
have?

25
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.380
And here's that little hint that we said - enter number of warthogs here. 

26
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.450
Now, if I write 10 and I click OK, nothing's going to happen because we haven't told JavaScript

27
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.010
what to do with our input value.

28
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.070
Remember, we kind of did a bit of this with the confirmation.

29
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.020
Well, how do we do this with prompt?

30
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.690
Let's let's have a look.

31
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.160
Let's do it.

32
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.169
The first thing we have to do, is we have to store the users decision in something, in a variable.

33
00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:10.639
So let's do that.

34
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.840
Let's say, let

35
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.560
number, because we know the user 

36
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.160
is going to insert a number. Let number equals whatever the user has put in - make sense so far.

37
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.280
And remember how we spoke about Template Literals?

38
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.850
I hope you do.

39
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.820
Because here we're going to go document.write()

40
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.710
and we're gonna use Template Literals  - those 2 back ticks.  

41
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.940
We're going to say, you have

42
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.260
and when you type in a variable within a Temperate Literal, you've gotta use the dollar sign

43
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.600
and the (curly) brackets.

44
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.330
And we've called it number.

45
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.220
So you have number ... 

46
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.640
And now if I save this

47
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.830
and we go into our page here, and refresh. 

48
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.800
Let's do it. Let's do a prompt. Enter number of warthogs.

49
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.690
Let's say I've got 3 warthogs and I click, OK.

50
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.290
You have 3 warthogs as pets.

51
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.990
That is a lot.

52
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.040
And you see how it's 

53
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.840
dynamically inserted the 3 on the page?

54
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.590
This is awesome.

55
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.450
This is what JavaScript is all about.

56
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.320
Hope you are enjoying yourself as much as me.

57
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.700
Let's continue.
