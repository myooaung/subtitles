00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,520
Yet another section and you can see I'm wearing a jacket.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,230
Why it has been raining all day, so I'm just a bit cold, so apologize if it makes me look a bit aggressive.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,830
But anyway, that's not the subject of this section.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,840
You get us to this keyword is massively important to understand why.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,700
Well, let me give you this example.

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,290
Say I make the statement to you.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,820
I have a dog named Wolf and I have a cat named meal.

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,270
And it is so sweet, but the other one is terrible.

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,610
What is it and what is the other one referring to?

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,760
Am I referring to the dog or the kettle, the kettle, the dog?

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,040
And it's just a very simple example, but you can really see how important it is when you execute program

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,760
functions and often in programming, you need this keyword.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,500
You want to understand the context environment in which your code is being run and you want to make

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,450
sure that it's referencing the right thing.

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,850
Anyway, I guess it's not making that much sense at the moment, but I promise you, at the end of the

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,780
section, you're going to be like, This is so easy.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:06,950
It's beginning.
