00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.400
Whew, okay, let me just step away from my PC quickly. 

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.840
And let's go outside.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.890
And I know what you're thinking.

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.110
You're probably thinking right now.

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.870
"Man, you need a haircut, Clyde, and shave."

6
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.000
And yes, you're 100% correct.

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.230
I might need to.

8
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.830
But put that aside, for now. There we go, and let's just take a step back.

9
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.820
This is only part one of this entire Grandmaster series.

10
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.380
We have only just begun.

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.160
And just think about what it is we've done. Before we start coding JavaScript, you need to understand

12
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.930
why we have JavaScript.

13
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.390
And that's why we looked at what programming is.

14
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.480
We looked at machine code, we looked at compile code.

15
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.290
We now know that JavaScript is actually interpreted code.

16
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.380
It runs in real time on your browser.

17
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.850
It's amazing that we didn't stop there.

18
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.750
We also looked at some JavaScript engines.

19
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.340
Something has to run JavaScript and then we kind of looked at where JavaScript fits in.

20
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.000
You know, we looked at HTML, CSS & where JavaScript fits in. It

21
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.310
can be quite confusing when you're

22
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.790
starting out.

23
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.580
And then we finally finished by just discussing the fact that JavaScript can live in different environments.

24
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.170
It can live in the browser, it can live in the server side -Node for example - and we can also use JavaScript

25
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.740
to access databases.

26
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.920
So it is a very, very powerful language.

27
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.070
But if you're anything like me, you love seeing things in action.

28
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.470
And that's why in the next part of the series, we're going to be discussing how to write JavaScript

29
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.310
in the console.

30
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.470
So, stick with me.

31
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.210
I know this was a bit of a theoretical class, but it is going to get a lot more practical as we go

32
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.540
forward.

33
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.490
See you in the next class.
