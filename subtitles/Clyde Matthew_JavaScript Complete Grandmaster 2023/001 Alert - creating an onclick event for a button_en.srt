00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:08,700
Alerts! (signal horn blows)
Strong alerts are needed for many interfaces. And in the past, messages were just done using native JavaScript

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,680
alerts, and you and I know how frustrating and ugly they are. 

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,090
And one of the problems is, is that the native alert JavaScript function

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,530
is a system object, and that just means we can't manipulate how it looks, um, it's literally coming

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,460
straight from the browser.

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:33,480
So in order to manipulate alerts, how they look and feel, we have to design our own CSS on the back

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:33,720
of it.

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,770
So I'm going to show you a few examples now of some alerts.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,640
Let's have a look.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,400
So here we go.

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,170
I've got a plain HTML page just called "alert" up and going.

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,310
So let's start now by producing an HTML page.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,990
I can call this "Alert Example".

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,810
And you can create this alert in many ways. You can create buttons, you can do inputs, you can do

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,220
images, etc.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,820
I'm just going to do an input here.

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,270
Make it a button, but you can do it in many ways.

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,840
So let's just make it a button. And let's do an "onclick" and let's fire a function that we can call whatever

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,260
we want.

20
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,970
Let's just call it show_alert.

21
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,300
And let's make the value of this input

22
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,200
I don't know

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,230
"Click me to execute a JavaScript alert."

24
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:40,280
Now, the one thing left to do, is for us to define this show_alert function, and that is JavaScript. 

25
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,400
Remember, JavaScript has to be inserted between script tags.

26
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,410
Let's execute.

27
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,630
So let's put this online.

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,320
There's our button that we created. And if I click on it, what do you expect to happen?

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,120
"YAY, this worked!". How easy is that? You've just seen how I've created a button, with a click event, and then 

30
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,700
this alert here, is JavaScript.

31
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,100
Let's get into some more examples.
