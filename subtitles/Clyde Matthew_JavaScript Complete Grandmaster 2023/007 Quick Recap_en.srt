1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,260
Whew!

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:03,630
So, okay, we've come quite a way.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,990
And I know I'm going a bit slowly and I apologize to some of you.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,850
But trust me, you need to get these basics down before you can really master the language.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,060
But it's time to take a step back and just remember what programming is. It's very simple.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,860
It's just a set of instructions that we give a computer to execute line by line. And these instructions

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,740
are just a sequence of small commands that we give the computer

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,910
one at a time, line after line.

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,060
It could be 2 instructions, it can be 2,000 instructions, it can be 2,000,000 instructions.

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,870
And there are rules and syntax about how we write these instructions which we're going to get into. But before

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,400
we can run, we need to walk.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,130
And unfortunately, you have to learn this stuff and trust me, once you learn these basics, you're

13
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,180
going to be well on your way to programming every single day because it's so much fun.

14
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,530
So let's move on.
