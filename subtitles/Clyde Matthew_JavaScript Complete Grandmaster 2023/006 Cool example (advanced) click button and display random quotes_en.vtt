00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.550
What about if we want a button and every time you hit that button, you want the paragraph text to change?

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.100
So say we've got four or five quotes every time you hit that button, just randomly select one of those

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.630
quotes and display it to the screen.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.500
How would we do that?

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.640
Well, let's do it together.

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.650
So the first step is let's create a brand new full, and it's called this project function advanced.

7
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.150
Within here.

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.880
Let's have an index, not each to all fall.

9
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.780
We've been through this.

10
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.500
We know that this is where we have to begin.

11
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.650
This is great to send a template.

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.470
And here, let's have a button.

13
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.530
And let's call this button show quote.

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.070
And now, once a container where we can show the quotes, and so let's just have an empty paragraph

15
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.590
take for now, we see this online.

16
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.210
Let's just have a look at what looks like.

17
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.910
We should just see an empty button that does nothing when we click.

18
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.500
So show quote, nothing happens.

19
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.220
We haven't defined anything yet, but we know we've got a button below the button.

20
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.300
We can have a paragraph take that is now empty, but that's going to be showing our quotes.

21
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.810
Let's go back to our editor and let's work on our quote.

22
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.000
So let's create again.

23
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.940
Let's just say we've got a public folder.

24
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.810
And within the public folder, it said, we've got your script, your JavaScript, we write tool and

25
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.350
JavaScript.

26
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.750
And in here, we want to shock words.

27
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.460
So let's define a function.

28
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.530
We start with the function key word we call it now, whatever we want, let's just call it show quote.

29
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.800
And within the curly braces, that's where we have all our code, our I'll meet.

30
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.580
And this is where we're going to be getting into using different data types that we've learned.

31
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.580
This is why it's important we learned those things previously and not now.

32
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.430
So the first step is we need a place to store all of our quotes into we.

33
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.080
Would we do that?

34
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.930
How do we do that?

35
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.820
Remember quotes such as strings?

36
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.740
It's going to be the strings all the time.

37
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.320
How can we store multiple quotes?

38
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.480
In an array?

39
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.640
Because in the race, those multiple values.

40
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.520
So let's call our array quotes.

41
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.940
And let's start off by making HonorÃ© empty.

42
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.890
We haven't got any quotes in them yet.

43
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.200
And now let's add all quotes.

44
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.640
How do we add quotes?

45
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.890
Well, we call our.

46
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.990
We state that the first item in the rain or remember, it starts with index zero because it references

47
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.730
where in memory we going to access this from.

48
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.890
And now it's zero.

49
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.640
We're going to access it directly from its very starting point, which is why zero first quote is when

50
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.200
you reach the.

51
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.150
In.

52
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.860
Of your rope, tie a knot in it and hang on.

53
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.230
Let's add another quote to add another quote we access our naira, which now has one item in it, and

54
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.390
now we want it to be the second item in the right.

55
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.620
And this quote can be there is nothing permanent, but change.

56
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.990
There is nothing.

57
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.960
Permanent, but.

58
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.630
Change.

59
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.630
Let's add another quick.

60
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.960
We exercise our right now, we're saying we want it to be the third element and let this quote be something

61
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.230
else.

62
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.940
So luck is a dividend of sweet.

63
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.630
And let's just do one more example, Ray.

64
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.010
We want this to be the fourth element in the array in this court can just be it takes as much energy

65
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.450
to wish as it does to play.

66
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.020
So there we go, we've got our quotes, we've got full quotes within this array.

67
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.270
Now what we wanting to do is we just wanting to display them randomly when this show quote function

68
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.830
is executed, when it's invoked.

69
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.240
How do you do that?

70
00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.400
Well, we need to create a random number between zero and three to access each one of these quotes.

71
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.020
How do you do that?

72
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.470
Well, let me write down first, then I'll explain to you what it is we've done.

73
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.880
You mean just get rid of this year?

74
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.260
So are we going to do is to find a random variable that keeps changing, and this random variable will

75
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.640
be the one that calls, I'll quote.

76
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.000
All right.

77
00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:24.420
So in effect, it's this rand is going to replace these numbers zero, one, two or three.

78
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.670
That rand will be a number that keeps changing.

79
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.930
It's all we're trying to do.

80
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.910
We can access JavaScript Smith object, and we're going to access the full method on it, which just

81
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.240
makes it a round hole, no, otherwise it's going to produce random numbers that are not a whole number

82
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.390
and we won't be able to access it in our.

83
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.890
That's all that this floor function does.

84
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.820
Then we're going to make excess JavaScript math, random function and because Mess Dot Random produces

85
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.250
a number between zero and one.

86
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.210
We need to multiply by our array length in order to allow this rand variable to take values the same

87
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.380
length as our array.

88
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.820
So that's why we've got to multiply by the quotes length.

89
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.260
And that's it.

90
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.900
We've literally defined our random variable.

91
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.610
Now what is the last step?

92
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.320
So let me just comment this.

93
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.220
You know what's happening?

94
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.600
Create a random number between zero and three.

95
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.200
And now do we have to do?

96
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.840
Well, now we've got an excess of paragraph, remember that paragraph to show you again in the index

97
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.700
file, we've got this paragraph take.

98
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.620
We want to display the quote in that paragraph take.

99
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.520
So, yeah, we have to identify the paragraphs.

100
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.390
Take.

101
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.430
And insert our quote.

102
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.170
Inside it.

103
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.380
OK, great.

104
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.330
So how do we identify the of take?

105
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.110
Well, we've done this in one of the previous lectures, but just to remind you, JavaScript has an

106
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.990
inbuilt get elements by take name method, and that method can be accessed on the document object.

107
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.980
So elements by tag, then we want to get the paragraph and remember what I say before this produces

108
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.700
a node list.

109
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:24.070
So if we have to actually access the first item on this list, then we want to change that in the tumult

110
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.360
attribute of this paragraph.

111
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.840
And we want that to be equal to what?

112
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.880
That's right.

113
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.560
We access our array of quotes and we pass in this rend variable.

114
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.800
Who and this should be it?

115
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.790
This should work.

116
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.290
Let me just explain.

117
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.580
Well, actually firstly, let's see if it works, and then I'll explain how this whole mess floor mess

118
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.480
random thing works.

119
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.000
So let's go to index page.

120
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.070
You know, if we go back to our website and we click this, nothing's going to happen because we haven't

121
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.570
drawn a link between sticking this button and executing that function.

122
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.660
Which is why we've got to go back to index page.

123
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:08.160
First thing we need to do is reference our script file and that's in the public folder and it's in a

124
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.540
file called script or.

125
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:16.560
Now all we have to do is we have to define when the functions called and we're going to do that whenever

126
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.250
the buttons clicked.

127
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:23.670
So insert on click event on this button and now we need to execute our function.

128
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.050
What did we call our function?

129
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.250
Let's have a look.

130
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.180
We call the function show quick.

131
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.500
So we need to go back to this file and we need to execute.

132
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.580
Should quit.

133
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.500
Whenever the button is clicked, let's see if this works.

134
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.230
Let's go to the website refresh.

135
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:53.750
It's click on show quote and you go paragraph gets the quote inserted into it, there's nothing permanent

136
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.110
but change, and every time we click on this quote, the changes.

137
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.370
How awesome is this to understand how powerful functions are, we don't have to rewrite code every time

138
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.640
we click a button, it's just executing that function again and again and again.

139
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:12.140
OK, so you're probably wondering how does this math function work over here?

140
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.150
Rand met Offloor messed up on random, what is all this?

141
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.320
He.
