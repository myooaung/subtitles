00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.910
Q.

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.090
So we've learned an incredible amount in a short space of time.

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.270
And sometimes it's just good to take a breather, step back and figure out where everything fits in.

4
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.560
So that's what I thought.

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.170
This would be a very, very quick recap.

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.340
Often people get confused between variables, objects and functions.

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.640
So let's just see where they all fit in variables.

8
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.640
Remember, we said we should be using constant late.

9
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.750
This is the new syntax introduced by year six concept and layout of variables, and all the variable

10
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.260
is is a container to store a piece of information.

11
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.450
Think about in your pantry, you put food in a container, you labeled a container and you put it on

12
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.870
the shelf.

13
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.070
That is all and variable is just a container.

14
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.550
When we use const, we know that we don't want that.

15
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.080
If a change, for example, my name.

16
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.960
But when you use the linked keyword, you stating that you actually can reassign that variable if you

17
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.380
want to.

18
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.330
So for example, if we're your age is going to change, so that's variable.

19
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.180
You've got that covered.

20
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.240
What objects will?

21
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.980
An object is also kind of like a container, but it doesn't just to one value installs a whole lot of

22
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.730
name, value pays and you separate each name that you pay by common.

23
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.700
We've seen this and to define an object, you have to use those curly brackets.

24
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.500
That's what tells JavaScript.

25
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.290
Hey, this is an object treated as an object.

26
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.650
And finally, we have functions which we've just been through and a function I like to think of as a

27
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.280
doing word.

28
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.340
It does something, and we learned about the new aero syntax, and we learned that the different ways

29
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.820
to define a function, the way you looking at now where we say it was.

30
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.830
And we've used the arrow syntax.

31
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.620
That's a function expression, and we've seen we should be using the return keyword in the execution

32
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.250
of the function.

33
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.450
And how do we invoke a function?

34
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.270
How do we call it?

35
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.270
How do we execute it?

36
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.030
Can you see all of these names or just fancy words?

37
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.620
But they all mean the same thing.

38
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.440
Well, to invoke the function wolf, we have to use the name Wolf because we have to tell JavaScript

39
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.670
which function we want to call, and then we just follow that by parentheses.

40
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.930
And that's it.

41
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.670
So take a step back.

42
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.370
Look at these on one piece of paper, have a bird's eye view, and then you can kind of start to feel

43
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.230
why we need all three.

44
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.290
We can't just do away with one purpose has been really, really cool section.

45
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.120
And I hope you've enjoyed the course.

46
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.760
I've had a tremendous amount of fun putting it together.

47
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.990
I love the stuff.

48
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.840
And the good news is we are not yet finished.

49
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.190
I'll see you soon.
