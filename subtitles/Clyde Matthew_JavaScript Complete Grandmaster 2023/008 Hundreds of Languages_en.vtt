00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.430
So the burning question you might be having right now is "where does JavaScript fit in here?"

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.890
And before I can answer that, I just want you to think about programming languages in general because

3
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.260
you and I know that they are hundreds of programming languages out there since the start of computing.

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.090
But at any given time, there are perhaps a dozen or so that are popular languages.

5
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.760
And as the years go by, different languages wax and wane in popularity and some come and go. Some are a big hit,

6
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.350
but most of them aren't.

7
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.810
So this list of popular programming languages changes over time

8
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.410
right?

9
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.230
But I'll be honest, this list changes very slowly.

10
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.330
And JavaScript is core.

11
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.950
JavaScript is one of those languages that have been around for a very long time, and I can't see how

12
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.330
JavaScript will disappear.

13
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.550
You know, it's in pretty much every single web page you visit - they have JavaScript in some form.

14
00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.810
Also, JavaScript is just a programming language and is one of many.  And most programmers during their

15
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.550
careers will not learn one language.

16
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.670
And the good news is for you and I is that once you've learnt one language, it's very quick and ...

17
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.780
well I wouldn't way very quick, that's

18
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.730
a lie,

19
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.940
okay, it's "easier".

20
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.230
Once you learn one language, it's "easier" to learn another language.

21
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.330
And that's partly because, you know, the rules and syntax is largely the same with a few a few tweaks

22
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.810
here and there.

23
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.320
I'm going to ask you a very cool question now. Are you really?

24
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.920
Are you listening?

25
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.150
Okay, hold on to your chair.

26
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.860
I'm going to ask you a very important question.

27
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.530
Why isn't there just one language?

28
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.320
Why are there these myriad of languages?

29
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.980
And the answer is drumroll, please.
(drumroll sound)

30
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.630
There is. It's called machine code. 

31
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.230
And let's jump into machine code now.
