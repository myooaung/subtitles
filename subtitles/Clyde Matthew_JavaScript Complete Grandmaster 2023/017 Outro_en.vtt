00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.450
Do you understand on money force, you've mastered it so well done, and like I mentioned, I hope you

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.109
weren't feeling intimidated by it.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.720
I know it has been a bit hard.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.830
We've got into a lot of functionality we haven't yet discussed in the course of don't worry if you were

5
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.910
a bit lost, but it will make sense by the end of this course.

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.720
The one thing I just want to mention as a closing point is that JavaScript is the language used to write

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.960
24, but the poly itself doesn't have to be used for JavaScript.

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.900
In fact, you can create a pencil to implement various browser features other than JavaScript.

9
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.260
Well, what other features am I talking about?

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.820
What other features can we create in the plentiful?

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.810
Well, pretty much anything.

12
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:51.720
You want things like a CGI canvas, wave storage, local and session storage videos HTML five elements

13
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.470
sees is responsive design, web sockets, geolocation.

14
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.580
Is that enough?

15
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.500
As you can tell, there's a lot we can do.

16
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.020
So it is a very important lesson for you to go through.

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.800
I'm glad you soldiered on with me, and I'll see you in the next section.

18
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.459
Enjoy it.
