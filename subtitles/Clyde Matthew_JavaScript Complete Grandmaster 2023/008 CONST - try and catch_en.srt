00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,180
(music) 
That's not a bad connection.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,330
That's just how amplified I am, and how much I'm enjoying this course.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,620
Before we move on from constants, I just want to show you one more example.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,860
And here I want to use what's known as the try and catch block.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:26,580
All it is, is that the try block of code allows you to try an expression and if it throws any errors

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,560
that's where the catch block comes in, and in the code defined within that block will be executed.

7
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,260
Let me give you an example, and going through this example, I hope you get a bit of feel for the const

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,300
keyword.

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,050
So let's define a number.

10
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,220
Let's make the number equal ten.

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,070
You know what I haven't done, I haven't stuck with best practice.

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:03,090
And that is, to have caps for your constants. So, let a NUMBER equal 10. Let's define a try block.

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,080
And again, I've got Quokka.

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,530
That's why we're seeing these errors displayed real time.

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,950
Let's try number equals

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,430
five.

17
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,090
And remember, with constants, we are unable to re-assign variables, which we've tried to do here.

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,420
So I'd expect the "catch" block to be executed.

19
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:29,310
And one thing with the catch block is that when an error is thrown through the try method, it passes

20
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,840
on a variable with the error in it.

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,410
So let's just call it error, and let's console.log error.

22
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,350
Is not giving us any errors! Of course, and this is another lesson that I've unintentionally was not

23
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,830
meant to give,

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,090
variables are case sensitive, so the constant NUMBER is different to this "number" in here, which is

25
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,390
why I've got to go caps and I would expect now an error.

26
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,320
And that's exactly what we have: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. 

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,210
We're not allowed to do that.

28
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,140
I hope you've learnt something. Don't stop.
