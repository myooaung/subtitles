1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,260
The cool thing with the console object is that we don't only have console.log available to us.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,700
We also have other methods.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,470
What are some of these other methods?

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,190
Well, let's have a look.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,060
It's exciting stuff.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,230
One of them that I want to show you now is called 

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,930
console.assert(). And assert is just a method on the console that takes two parameters.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,060
Okay, you've got to feed the function two things.

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,790
The one is just a boolean expression, and by boolean I just mean true or false.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,870
And then you have to feed, um, the second parameter you have to feed it

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,330
is what happens when that assertion fails.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,000
It gives us some sort of an alert.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,040
Let me give you a practical example.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,200
Let's say you're developing a site and you only want people above the age of 50 to enter the site.

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,800
Why?

16
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,280
I don't know.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,420
So let's say you got a gentleman and his age, let age equals 35. 

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,640
And let's say he wants to come onto your site.

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:02,450
Well let's say, in your code, that you want an alert or you want to alert the user that he's not allowed onto 

20
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,980
your site. We can go console

21
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,670
console.assert().

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,570
Remember the first parameters is a boolean. And what do you want to happen?

23
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,960
You want the age to be greater than 50, remember?

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,820
And your second

25
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,360
Parameter is what you want to happen, or what you want to say to the user when this fails.

26
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,870
In this case, if it fails, he's going to be below 50

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,410
so you want to say "Access denied.

28
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,290
You're too ...

29
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,340
You are too young

30
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,810
to enter here."

31
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,340
What do you think's going to happen when I push return?

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,170
You guessed it, it comes up with an assertion, and it gives you the error message.

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,530
How cool is that?

34
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,480
Another cool method is the count method on console. What's the count method?

35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,670
Well, let me show you. It'll be easier that way.

36
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:07,230
console.count takes one argument, and that is the label that you want to give it, and it tells

37
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,660
you how many times something has been done.

38
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,060
So let's say you got a button and you want to know how many times the users clicked on the button.

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,880
All the count, well the console.count, method does, is that it keeps track as to how many times an action has been called. Simple,

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,150
right?

41
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,350
Let's see it in action.
