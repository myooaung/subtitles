1
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:02,870
So let's start at the basics.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:08,960
Programming involves a lot of jargon and terminology, but don't panic

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,520
okay,

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,190
because once you understand the jargon, you'll find it surprisingly easy.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,200
And what is programming?

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,640
Well, I mean, at the end of the day, programming is just a set of instructions that tells the computer

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,120
what to do.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,080
And the good news for you and I, is that these instructions are in plain English, and these instructions

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,510
are just made up of tiny little commands.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,100
Again, you can call them commands,

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,230
you can call them instructions

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:33,810
it doesn't matter.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,670
And we refer to these commands or instructions as the programming syntax.

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,470
But I don't wanna

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:39,960
jump ahead.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,150
We're going to get into syntax now and all that kind of stuff.

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,260
For now, I just want you to know that these commands are simple. Each command on its own is very simple,

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,650
and they're often the same for most different programming languages.

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,170
So whether you're programming in Java, C#, etc etc, a lot of them all have these same

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,190
little nuances.

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,310
So the benefit is, once you learn this, it's going to set you on a path of becoming an excellent programmer

22
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,150
in any language.

23
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,440
Just take a step back.

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,540
The important point that I want you to know from this, is that programming is just a set of instructions.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,060
That's it. It's just English.

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,110
It's just words.

27
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:21,530
So when you get frustrated and you will, and when you start pulling your hair out, just step back

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,440
and go, You know what?

29
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,170
I've obviously got the wrong words.

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,700
I've obviously got the wrong syntax.

31
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,570
I'm putting a full stop where I shouldn't, or putting a colon where it shouldn't be. 

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,700
And that's all I want you to get from this lecture.

33
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,160
So this lecture is ... programming is just a set of instructions to tell the computer what to do, and those

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,690
instructions are written in English.

35
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,770
Let's move on.
