1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,510
Oh, OK.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,120
I've just had a haircut, so I'm ready, I'm ready to go.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,200
Now I want to show you Visual Studio Code in a little bit more detail before we start actually just

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,550
typing in here.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,050
I want you to understand how it works.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,650
So let's just take a step back.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,840
So you can see at the bottom right of the screen, there's this Go Live server that I'm running.

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,280
But where did it come from?

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,290
Well, let's look at this Extensions tab here.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,340
If you click on that, and you just start typing "live server" it should come up.

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,930
Wait for it ...

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,400
There you go. 

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,420
And the one I installed is this purple one here called Live Server.

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,950
So I obviously won't have to install it because I've just done it now, but that's how you can install

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,120
it on your Visual Studio. 

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:59,060
If you click the Explorer button, we are back now to the main tab. So what I want to show you is let's create

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,920
let's just quickly create very simple JavaScript.

18
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,920
Let's call it an index.html page. 

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,310
Let's just set up a standard HTML type document.

20
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,060
Now, within the body tag, what I want to show you

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:18,920
is this.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,250
What you're going to see shortly is that JavaScript has to be written within script tags.

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,730
And let's just make something up.

24
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:38,460
Let's just say let a =5, let b = 10, and then let's console.log(a + b).

25
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,380
You are very familiar now with what console.log is.

26
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,640
And let's run this code.

27
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,390
All you need to do is click on Go Live.

28
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,370
So the page is blank, but check at this.

29
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,750
You can see 127.0.0.1. And then this here is the port number. 

30
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,860
All you need to know is that this is your machine, your actual computer, but what do I mean by a local machine?

31
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,040
We'll have a look at this quickly. Stepping back

32
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,600
let's just discuss this local server in a little bit more detail

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,630
so you start actually intuitively understanding what it is we're doing with Visual Studio Code, writing

34
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,430
code and then running that in the browser.

35
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,150
Now, when you request a website externally, and by externally I just mean you've got an internet connection

36
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,010
and you type in a website, say it's google.com, when you type in that request

37
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:43,060
that request has to go and fetch that website, it has to go and fetch that HTML and CSS for your browser to

38
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,480
interpret.

39
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,410
Where does it fetch it from?

40
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,490
Well, your request gets sent to a server, an external server.

41
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,940
It can go to multiple servers.

42
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,430
It can go to a root server, which then sends it to a name server.

43
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,950
This can happen multiple times for the internet to actually try and find that website that hosts your

44
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,140
.html and your JavaScript.

45
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:10,350
And let's say that eventually it finds your websites HTML and JavaScript code, it sends it back

46
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,060
through all the servers and all that kind of thing, into your browser and then your browser can run it

47
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,190
and display it on your computer.

48
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,510
Even in these external environments, a lot of people use Visual Studio Code.

49
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,560
But there's an alternative way, especially when you are developing sites initially, you don't want

50
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,640
to be hosting this thing on live environments, you just want to run it from your computer.

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,850
You don't even necessarily want to have an internet connection.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,640
So let's get rid of the external server environment.

53
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,880
And what are we left with?  Well, an alternative is this local server. And all the local server does, is when

54
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,100
you go and request that specific website that you're developing, instead of going to external servers,

55
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:58,400
it just does a loop and it finds it within its own computer within its own machine.

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,350
That's all that a local server is.

57
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:05,060
A local server just means that your computer's actually serving that file to a browser instead of you

58
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,560
going to an external server

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,710
environment. I hope that makes sense.

60
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,380
Let's continue.

61
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,800
So now that you know what a local server is,

62
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,660
I want to show you something.

63
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,670
Let's inspect this page quickly.

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,060
If you click on the console, well there is our JavaScript, remember, I'll switch back to it quickly.

65
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,170
We went console.log(a + b) which is 15. 

66
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,420
It's exactly what we see here.

67
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:40,760
If you click on the Network tab and you refresh the page, there's the file - its literally fetched the file.

68
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Your computer's fetched your own file. And if you click on that, you can obviously see that we've got

69
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,740
no HTML embedded in there.

70
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,600
So, that's what I wanted to get across. I just want you to understand what we are doing when we actually

71
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,240
typing code in Visual Studio Code. Let's continue.
