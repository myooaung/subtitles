00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.730
What do we do if we want this to actually display correctly?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.390
Well, as the previous previous example showed, all we have to do is replace the location of the script

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.690
tag.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.110
So let's take the script tag,

5
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.100
leave it below the paragraph tag,

6
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:28.300
let's click Go Live, it's already running. 4.0.html.

7
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.810
So now before I press the return key, what would you expect to happen?

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.450
Well, we're still going to expect a 5 second delay because the browser still has to encounter that

9
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.400
script tag before it hits the paragraph tag.

10
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.670
But when we check our console log, we should see that element displayed. Let's wait 

11
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.390
five seconds.
(countdown timer)

12
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.970
There you go.

13
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.340
The text is displayed.

14
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.020
Let's have a look at the console.

15
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.750
And there it is, there is the element that we've console logged to the screen.

16
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.780
How awesome was it?

17
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.160
I hope you're enjoying it.

18
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.670
There's one more thing, though, I want to tell you quickly before we move on.
