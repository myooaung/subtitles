00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.110
Okey, dokey.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.560
Why have objects, why not just have variables?

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.200
Let me quickly show you, you should say why objects?

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.020
Let's assume we have a motorbike.

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.170
It's blue, it's on two wheels and it's a Yamaha.

6
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.360
We can represent this in an object way, object oriented.

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.560
Or we can just use variables, sure, you.

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.400
Lead bike make equals.

9
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.130
Yemen.

10
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.940
It black color equals blue and the black wheels to.

11
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.220
So this is possible, we can do this.

12
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.010
But now you've got to start thinking in the future, how do we attach all these to one specific user

13
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.110
and then the user wants to change just one of these?

14
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.940
It's going to become very cumbersome, which is where objects come into the picture.

15
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.040
This is variables.

16
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.080
Now we can use.

17
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.050
Objects.

18
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.960
Linked to do with an object.

19
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.550
This use the curly braces, we've actually created an object right now, even though nothing's in it,

20
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.350
and I'll prove it to you if we just console.log back out.

21
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:27.890
You can see it's an empty object and we can go top of this just console type of like you can see like,

22
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.760
is an object.

23
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.920
How cool this is, it's create one right again.

24
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.250
So say.

25
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.670
Make.

26
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.690
Is Yamaha?

27
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.520
The.

28
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.200
Wheels.

29
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.730
To.

30
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.940
This is an object you can really start feeling and getting a sense as to how much easier it is to work

31
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.560
with objects, and it is variables, but they are kind of similar variables.

32
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.230
We have name value pays as well, like make value by color value, flywheels value.

33
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.990
Same with objects, name value, name value.

34
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.510
So they are very closely related, but it is just much easier working with an object than it is a variable,

35
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.910
as you can see in this example.

36
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.390
But before we get into even more detail, let's continue this to other points we need to discuss.
