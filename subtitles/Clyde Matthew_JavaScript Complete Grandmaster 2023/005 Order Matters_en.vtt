00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.150
We've just learnt that programming is a set of instructions.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.420
And each instruction tells a computer what to do.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.360
And even though each instruction might be tiny, it might just only give a small snippet and tell the computer

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.840
what to do.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.980
But the important point that you need to grasp is that each instruction can be very small, but it needs

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.300
to be very specific.

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.650
And get this, the art of programming is to take a large idea, something big you want to do and break

8
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.720
it into small, tiny steps.

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.550
So programming works similar to giving someone directions.

10
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.780
Let me give you an analogy.

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.760
Say there's one person in a blue car and another person in a red car, and they're wanting to travel from point

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.900
A to point B. You say to the blue car "go up, left and then right" in that order.

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.370
But you give the red car the same set of instructions, but just in a different order.

14
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.610
You say "go up, right and then left".

15
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.080
What do you think is going to happen?

16
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.800
Well, you know what's going to happen. The blue car is going to end up on the left and the red car is going

17
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.500
to end up on the right.

18
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.010
So what I'm trying to just get at right with this very simple example is that the sequence of writing your

19
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.230
instructions becomes vitally important.

20
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.410
And if you mix these up, you're going to get a very different result.

21
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.240
And it's the same with programming.

22
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.220
We're giving directions to the computer.

23
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.340
That's it. Instead of giving directions to blue car or red car

24
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.750
we're giving directions to computer, and the order of the instructions,

25
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.300
the order of the commands, is crucial.

26
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.840
Because what the computer does is it processes each instruction line by line in the order that you write

27
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.010
it.
