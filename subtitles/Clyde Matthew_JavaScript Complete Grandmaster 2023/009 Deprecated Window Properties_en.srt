1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,880
Remember how we said the Window object gives you access to a whole lot of other functionality other

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,310
than the content of the web page.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,000
One of those is what's known as the Navigator. And I just want to say that as you start exploring these

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,790
things, just understand that some things might be deprecated. And by deprecated

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,620
it's a very much the programming term, and it just means that it's no longer supported.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,560
So you're may get some weird results, sometimes.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,620
And an example of that is navigator.appCodeName.

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,760
That will always give you Mozilla, even if you're not using Mozilla.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,800
This is a weird kind of thing that happens.

10
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,210
Another example is navigator.name.

11
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,410
And it just always gives you Netscape.

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,470
So you might be asking, "why is it still around if it's deprecated?"

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,170
Well, according to the HTML Living Standard (or HTML5), these values must be retained, and the only reason they're

14
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,810
still around is for backwards compatibility.

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,330
What I mean by that, or um, think about an app that was built with these functions in the past, and now

16
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,610
suddenly, if they removed it, those apps would break.

17
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,700
So their removal could break an app that depends on them

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,010
in other words. And as you know, as with other web standards, we pretty much always in a bit of a transitional

19
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,370
phase.

20
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,830
So until that happens, just be just be careful.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,730
There's all I'm trying to say.
