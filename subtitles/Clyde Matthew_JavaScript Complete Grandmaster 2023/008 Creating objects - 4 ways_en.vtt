00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.540
So we've already been seeing examples of objects playing around with him, but I want to be more specific

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.290
now, how do we create objects?

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.070
Well, in other programming languages, you need a class to create an object.

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.960
But in JavaScript, an object as a standalone entity, there is no need for classes.

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.130
And if you actually take a step back and you look under the hood, JavaScript doesn't have a true class.

6
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.100
Everything in JavaScript is pretty much an object.

7
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.240
So the question is will, then how do we create an object?

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.620
We've already seen some ways that we've created objects, but I want to stress this there is no right

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.850
way to create an object.

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.930
That's right.

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.900
You can choose.

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.880
And that's what makes JavaScript very dynamic and awesome.

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.570
It's very flexible.

14
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.430
You must just use whatever method suits your situation at that point in time.

15
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.540
What all the different ways we can create an object in JavaScript.

16
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.210
Well, I can break it down into full.

17
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.970
You could object literal object constructor, object create and you've got this New Year's class and

18
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.500
I guess it's only natural.

19
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.120
Let's start with the very first one.

20
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.920
An object literal.

21
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.520
An object literals also known as an object laser.

22
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.470
The reason they call it an initializes to be consistent with other terminology used in other programming

23
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.220
languages like C++ and creating an object flying object literal is one of the easiest ways to create

24
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.450
a variable in JavaScript.

25
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.520
All you need to do is to find property values inside curly braces.

26
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.490
We've seen this we've done examples where we said it by equal and we had these curly braces.

27
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.510
And what we do within the curly braces, we use a comment to separate multiple key value plays.

28
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.790
Let's have a look at another example of how to create an object by object.

29
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.110
Literal syntax.
