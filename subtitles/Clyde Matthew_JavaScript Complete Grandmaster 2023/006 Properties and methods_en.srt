1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,370
We've seen it objects consist of a whole bunch of name value pairs, but what are these names and what

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,210
are these values?

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,710
Well, again, take a step back and object can only contain two things.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,820
That's it.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,110
So complicated properties and methods.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,970
What do I mean by that?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,550
Well, let's just take the simple HTML button.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,770
What are the properties of their button properties or things like width and height?

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,350
What are methods?

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,840
I like to think of methods as doing words, so for example, when we're talking about a button, it

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,600
could be on click events or even on your keyboards when you click enter or even when you take your mouse

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,490
and you hover over that HMO button, those events or methods attached to the object.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,330
Cool.

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,850
So we've seen objects consists of properties and methods.

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:48,900
What do we mean?

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,460
Let's start typing code.

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,380
And it say we have a bike.

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,850
One of the ways to create an object is to you've got to sneeze coming.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,910
This for men, one will know.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,490
I'm done.

21
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,540
Hey, sorry.

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,220
So let's create an object.

23
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,320
And this is object back.

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,360
Think about an object as a big container.

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,710
And it said to make about bike is Yamaha.

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,580
Hello is blue.

27
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,730
It's got wheels, the two of them.

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,770
So we've done properties now, but remember, objects consists of properties and methods.

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,510
Method is more for doing words, something that happens.

30
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,130
So this defining method, let's call it sound and oldest method does is it creates sound.

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,720
Let's say we just console.log.

32
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,440
There you have it, an object consists of properties, the property has the mate, the colour, the

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,150
wheels and methods.

34
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,340
Yeah, we've just created a sound method.

35
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,160
But how do we exercise these properties and methods?

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,320
What do we do to extract it?

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,910
Let's have a look.
