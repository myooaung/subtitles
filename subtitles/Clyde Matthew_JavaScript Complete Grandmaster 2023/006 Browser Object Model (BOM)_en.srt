1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,290
The console object gives you access to the browser's Console, we've just seen that, and it allows us

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,480
developers to log certain results and alerts and warnings to the screen.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,370
But what is the console?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,160
How did we have that method available to us?

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,590
Well, you need to understand the Window object.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,660
That's where it came from.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,700
And the console is part of the Window object.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,940
What's the Window object?

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, the Window object is supplied by what's known as the Browser Object Model,

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,320
or you can say BOM for short - the Browser Object Model.

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,040
And the BOM allows JavaScript to talk to the browser about things other than the content of the page.

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,500
So yes, JavaScript can interact directly with what the user is looking at on the web page,

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,860
but there's also other information that the browser's Window gives us.

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,660
What other information?

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,560
Well things like navigator, screen, location history, etc.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,410
The Window object is the root element of the whole website.

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,240
Think about the king sitting on his throne and all his peasants and subjects beneath him.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,690
The king, in this case, is the Window object that defines everything that you and I can do on a web

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,310
page, more than just manipulate its content.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,880
And I know it's difficult to actually picture

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,340
so let me let me try and just draw a picture for you.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,870
I hope it helps.

23
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,880
Let's picture the whole universe of the browser and the web page and everything, the little tabs and

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,930
everything, in this blue box.

25
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,980
And at the very top of this box, you've got the Window.

26
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,220
And that's the entire browser.

27
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,410
That's what I'm trying to say - that it defines the whole universe. And this Window provides two broad categories

28
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,170
of functionality to us. It provides us with the document.

29
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,500
And by document, I mean, it's the website

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,340
we're actually looking at. Titles on the screen, buttons we can click on, etc.

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,710
The other thing it gives us, though, is things like I mentioned, the navigator, location, screen,

32
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,460
the history, etc.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,390
And I hope this sinks in because this is an awesome aspect of JavaScript in the console and how things

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,280
fit in with each other that most people don't understand.

35
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,710
And I'm sharing some awesome knowledge here - things that taken me a long time to learn.

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,550
So I hope you appreciate it. Anyway,

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,790
moving on, moving on.

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,360
So we know what the Window object is, and each browser tab has its own Window object.

39
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,840
So when you've got two different tabs open in your browser, they can't share each other's objects.

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,400
The one has a Window object and the other one has an entirely different Window object.

41
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:34,270
The other thing worth mentioning here is that there are no standards for the Browser Object Model. You know,

42
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,700
like for JavaScript, we've got the standard ECMAScript.

43
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,770
Well, there are no standards for the BOM, and the whole HTML document

44
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,850
you know, where we type our HTML code, headers, bodies, paragraphs, etc

45
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,760
That is a property of the Window object.

46
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,950
Remember, because the Window object is king. And a very useful Window object is ... and you guessed it, the

47
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,820
Window's console.

48
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,020
And you can access the objects of a Window (object) by using the dots.

49
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,170
So "window.console" would be how to access the console object.

50
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,300
But remember, we didn't type "window.".

51
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,720
We just typed console.

52
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,210
And that's true for Windows objects.

53
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:18,490
You don't have to write window dot. So it's exactly the same if we just wrote the word console.
