1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,660
Whew.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,330
Okay, so let's take another step back.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,010
Okay.

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,780
Unwind. Clear your mind.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,940
Let's just see what we've learnt.

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,410
So we've learned that machine code can only speak zeros and ones, right, which is at the processor

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:13,760
level.

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,280
And there are all those horrible languages that we don't want to touch.

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,410
Then a little bit higher than that, you've got, you know, still low level languages.

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,840
Examples are C, C++ and they just require deeper knowledge of how hardware and underlying CPU's actually

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,170
work.

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,930
They're more difficult to write from that point of view.

13
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,880
And then you've got high level languages, which are very practical and very powerful.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,590
And that's where JavaScript fits in.
