OK, let's just have a quick recap on variables ... var, let and CONST. 

2
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.400
Well, the first thing you must remember is that when you write const, let or var, it tells the JavaScript

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.290
engine to store it in memory. And just to remind you when you use the var keyword, you're actually

4
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.950
declaring a variable at the global scope.

5
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.460
If you haven't done so in a function, we'll get into this a bit more later.

6
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.700
But don't use var!

7
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.200
Rather use "let" and "const". And you use let when you wanna (later) change the value, and you use const when you

8
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.360
want the value to never change.
