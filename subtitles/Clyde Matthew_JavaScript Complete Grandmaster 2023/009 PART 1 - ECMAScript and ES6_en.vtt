00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.860
You may or may not have heard the term ES6, or ECMAScript, or ES2015.

2
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.560
The problem is, it can get quite confusing if you don't understand what these terms mean.

3
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.560
It all started with Netscape.

4
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.970
And for those of you who don't know what Netscape was, it just used to be a browser.

5
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.710
In fact, it used to be the most popular browser, and a company called AOL acquired Netscape in 1999.

6
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.390
Netscape asked a gentleman called Brendan Eich to develop a language that resembled Java. Right, and

7
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.250
they wanted this language for the web of Netscape.

8
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.060
Eich, however, decided that Java was too complicated with all its rules.

9
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.010
And so he set out to create a simpler language that even a beginner could code in.

10
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.150
This is evident in things such like relaxing the need to have a semicolon everywhere. After the language

11
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.610
was completed by Eich, the marketing team of Netscape

12
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.710
got permission to name it, JavaScript.

13
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.420
So in December 1995, Netscape announced JavaScript in a press release.
(swoosh)

14
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.130
About a year or two after JavaScript release in the browser, Microsoft's Internet Explorer took the language

15
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.080
and they also started making their own implementation, and they actually called it "JScript".

16
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.710
At the same time, Internet Explorer was dominating the market and not long after Netscape had to shut

17
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.490
its project down.

18
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.970
But before they shut down, Netscape decided to start a standard that would guide the path of JavaScript.

19
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.770
They submitted the language to the European Computer Manufacturers Association.

20
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.290
That's a bit of a mouthful, but there were trademark issues associated with the name JavaScript, and

21
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.450
the standard became known as ECMAScript, which is a name that it holds today.

22
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.610
ECMAScript has had a few releases, and in 1999 they released ECMAScript3 before they went

23
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.500
into hibernation for the next 10 years.

24
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.420
And during this 10 years, Microsoft dominated the scenes, but at the same time, they weren't improving

25
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.970
their product. And hence Firefox was born.

26
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.490
Firefox, by the way, was also led by Eich. And a whole heap of other browsers such as Chrome, Oprah,

27
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.220
etc., etc. started making the scenes.

28
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.770
You know, a lot of people get confused between ECMAScript and JavaScript, and whether ECMAScript

29
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.020
is the language and JavaScript is a dialect is arguable in my mind and

30
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.720
who cares?

31
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.560
Like, it's not important.

32
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.590
There is no compiler out there that runs ECMAScript.

33
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.470
So I believe JavaScript is considered a language which implements a standard called ECMAScript.
