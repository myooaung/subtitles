1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,140
Let's get into this.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,340
What is this?

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,600
Simply put.

4
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,150
I like to think of this as the object.

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,800
It belongs to you.

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,450
And what is it?

7
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,130
Well, it's going to sound strange, but it is this it's whatever you're referring to.

8
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,190
I just want to highlight three things before we deep dive into this keyword one.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,520
And this is the most crucial point of them all.

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,940
The value of this is usually determined by the execution context and execution.

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,330
Context simply means how function has been called.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,980
Point number two.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,500
This may be different and by different, I just mean, it may refer to different things.

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,260
Each time a functions call and point number three is don't stress if you don't understand.

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,810
Point number one and point number two, it's all going to make sense by the end of the section.

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,360
Now, before we dig deeper into this, we need to understand the execution context.

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,050
Remember, point one point one was that the value of this is usually determined by what?

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,270
By the execution context.

19
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,200
So now we need to understand this execution context in detail.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,170
And trust me, it is so awesome to know this kind of stuff.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,880
And I hope you really enjoy this up and coming lectures.

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,550
I've had a lot of fun putting it together.

23
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,270
And if you still confused or if it doesn't make sense, ask questions.

24
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,500
I'm here to help.

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,790
I'm sure all the students doing this course are willing to help, but helps everyone.

26
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,680
But enough said, Let's get into it.
