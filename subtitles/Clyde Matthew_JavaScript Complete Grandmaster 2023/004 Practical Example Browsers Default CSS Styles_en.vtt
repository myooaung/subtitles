00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.320
Quick lecture. I just want to show you what I mean by browser having default CSS styles.

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.810
What do I mean, and let me prove it to you, right now. 

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.680
Quick lecture. 

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.530
So let's create a HTML page quickly.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.270
Let's just get Notepad, okay, and lets just type HTML body paragraph.

6
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.090
Hello World.

7
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.290
Close body.

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.040
Close HTML, okay.

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.410
Let's just say this to the desktop "Save As". Make sure you save it at "test.html".

10
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.320
Otherwise it won't work.

11
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.700
Where is it, where is it? There it is, here. Okay.

12
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.110
And let's give it a go.

13
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.810
Here it is.

14
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.790
OK.

15
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.530
"Hello World". You can see its displaying, over here.

16
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.510
Let's just inspect this quickly.

17
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.860
So guys, this is what's interesting, right?

18
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.800
I did not format that "Hello World".

19
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.160
I didn't put the margins at the top.

20
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.880
You can see if you look closely, there's like a, let me just zoom in here for you, 

21
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.120
you can see there is space here, there is literally space.

22
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.380
I didn't put that in there.

23
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.360
And when you inspect this, you can see here there's a paragraph element. And all these things here,

24
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.770
the padding, I didn't do that. You saw that I didn't do that. 

25
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.320
And you can see this word here:

26
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.890
"user agent stylesheet".

27
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.400
This means that this is the default stylesheet applied by Google Chrome

28
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.690
in this case, that's what I'm using.

29
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.220
And if you look at the bottom right, you can see here is Times New Roman.

30
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.930
Hang on, my video is in the way. 

31
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.850
Sorry.

32
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.140
Let me quickly move it.

33
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.450
There you go.

34
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.790
So you can see here, at the bottom right, this (font) is Times New Roman. 

35
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.450
So there you go.

36
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.920
Just wanted to prove it to you.

37
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.290
That browsers have default CSS styles. 

38
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.190
Let's continue.
