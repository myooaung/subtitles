Something else you're going to be coming across a lot of in JavaScript, and other programming languages,

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.950
is what's known as "console.log".

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.210
Enough said.

4
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.290
Let's get into it.

5
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.630
Oh, actually, before we get into the reason why console.log is awesome is because remember those alerts

6
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.790
we had just written? They are horrible man and we don't want alerts to be popping up all the time.

7
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.800
It's frustrating.

8
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.390
So an alternative to this is to use console.log. Okay, enough said. Let's go.

9
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.620
So let's open up our console and start typing this. So you'll see here this console helps me, because

10
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.550
if I start writing "cons", you can see its telling me here, 

11
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.060
"console".

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.030
So if you forget keywords, you can kind of do that. Now, to access objects, properties of objects,

13
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.690
you need a period or full stop.

14
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.020
I'll get into this later.

15
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.910
Don't worry about it for now.

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.400
But the most popular one that you need to remember now is what's called this console.log.

17
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.190
So let's type "console.log". Similar remember,

18
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.280
we have to use the parentheses to execute a function. And let's console.log the word "dog". Enter.

19
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.380
And "Bob's Your Uncle", there's dog, printed to the screen.

20
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.000
And let's try it again, console.log - lets try one plus one.

21
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.870
Do you think that'll work?

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.990
Yes.

23
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.950
The answers 2.  We could have just gone 1 plus 1 directly in the console.

24
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.640
Same thing.

25
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.510
OK, it evaluates to 2.

26
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.230
But this brings me to something more important, what is "console"?

27
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.220
Where do that come from?

28
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.690
How does it fit into the page?

29
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.840
Well, if I type "CONSOLE". Whoops sorry thats caps. If I type "console" and I just push enter, 

30
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.100
let's see what that gives us.

31
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.620
Well, it gives us this funny looking object here.

32
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.720
What is this?

33
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.660
And it's got a little triangle - let's click that. And you can see all the properties that we have access

34
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.470
to on this console.

35
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.080
How awesome is that?

36
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.790
And you can see the log is on the screen.

37
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.180
That's literally the log that we just use, so we used "console.log".

38
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.940
And this brings us to something very interesting that I want to chat about now.

39
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.440
Let's get into it.
