00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.100
Okidoki. It's enough already.

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.770
You probably sitting there just wanting a practical example of how this all fits together.

3
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.680
We know every website consists of 1) HTML, 2) CSS and 3) JavaScript.

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.520
But how does it all fit together and what is a practical example?

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.270
Because I know if you like me, you get frustrated not seeing it in action.

6
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.480
Well, let me give you one, and I'll give you a very simple example.

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:34.160
Let's say we have a button. A simple HTML button, which you can easily write with HTML with the tag

8
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.550
button.

9
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.980
What's going to pop up on your screen?

10
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.620
You guessed it, a boring old button.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.540
But what if we want to spice this button up, make it look nice?

12
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.940
Well, one option could be to make it blue.

13
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.710
And what do you use for that?

14
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.320
You guessed it, CSS! And I know its ugly,

15
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.050
I'm just giving you an example here.

16
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.420
But what do you think's going to happen now

17
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.190
when you go and click that button?

18
00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.280
Well, let's try.

19
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.810
Nothing, because you need JavaScript.

20
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.970
And that's the point I'm trying to get across here.

21
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.610
What about if we wanted to push that button and change the word "Push me" to something like, I don't

22
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.960
know, "I've been clicked"?

23
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.520
How would we do that?

24
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.180
The first thing you need to be familiar with when it comes to writing JavaScript is the well known script

25
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.660
tag.

26
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.200
JavaScript has to be inserted between script tags.

27
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.410
So you're going to be seeing this every single time you write JavaScript.

28
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.710
And when your browser goes through your code and it sees the script tag, your browser knows that it

29
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.240
needs to interpret JavaScript.

30
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.200
That's how your browser kicks-in. That's how it knows what to do with that JS code.

31
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.800
So remember that. The other thing you must remember is that you can either write your JavaScript code

32
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.750
directly between those script tags, and we'll do that here just because it's a lot easier,

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.020
you'll see later in this course, the more common way to do it, is to actually write your JavaScript

34
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.660
code in another file and then your script tags just have to point to that file or that URL.

35
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.720
And now for some awesome knowledge ... did you know you can write other languages within the script tag?

36
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.810
But generally, everyone uses it for JavaScript.

37
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.620
So when you go and you see old examples in other courses or when you start Googling, you might come

38
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.220
across a script tag where they've got a type attribute, where that type attribute is text forward

39
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.300
slash JavaScript.

40
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.420
But what you need to know is that you don't really need this.

41
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.190
Why?

42
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.640
Because that's old school.

43
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.270
The HTML5 Specification makes JavaScript the default language found within script tags.

44
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.450
In other words, when your browser comes across a script tag, it will automatically assume that that

45
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.590
code is JavaScript.

46
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.870
So now, how do we write JavaScript?

47
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.670
No one really taught me this, but I like to break it down into 3 broad categories.

48
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.290
Step one: Identify the thing you're wanting to affect in some way.

49
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.160
In this case, we're wanting to effect the button, so let's identify it using JavaScript. And don't worry

50
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.000
about the syntax.

51
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.390
We'll get into the syntax and how we write JavaScript later in this course, 

52
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.920
I just want you to understand the process.

53
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.830
Step two: we need to tell JavaScript when to run the code. In this case, that's when we click a button.

54
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.140
And lastly: we need to define what happens when the button is clicked.

55
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.930
And this is where the meat of your JavaScript code happens.

56
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.060
This is where you're going to be writing the majority of your code.

57
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.600
In our case, it's a really simple example. We just want the words to change on the button to

58
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.920
"I've been clicked".

59
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.040
You've just written your first JavaScript.

60
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.150
How awesome is that?

61
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.760
And you can see, it's not that difficult.

62
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.960
It's literally just a few English words structured in a logical manner, which gets to a result.

63
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.430
That's all that JavaScript is.

64
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.850
And it has to be within the script tags.

65
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.670
Just remember that.

66
00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.000
So now when we go and click that button
(click sound) 
this time it's going to perform as we expected.

67
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.780
And this is obviously a very very simple example, but I really hope it has solidified the concept of how

68
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.340
JavaScript, how CSS and how HTML fit in with each other.

69
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.079
And you're probably wondering ... how do you put the JavaScript in your code, what files to put it in,

70
00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:18.980
how to reference it all etc

71
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.190
Don't worry, we're going to get into that. For now,

72
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.980
this is just a very important concept for you to grasp.

73
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.690
I guess we're done.

74
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.320
Let's move on.
