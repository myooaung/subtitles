1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,690
So you starting to wrap your head around programming, what it is.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,910
Garbage in, garbage out that it's a set of instructions executed line by line.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,700
And we did mention this thing called "syntax".

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,970
Syntax is just another word, or another way to say how we write these instructions to a computer.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,950
You know, I'm speaking English now.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,950
I've got to structure my sentences in a certain way.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,290
We need a full stop at the end of each sentence.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,670
Well, with some programming languages, they want you to put a semicolon at the end of each instruction,

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,810
at the end of each command.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,190
It's the same thing right?

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,980
So instead of putting a full stop at the end of each sentence, you put a semicolon.

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:45,180
Some programming languages, all uppercase, some languages are all lowercase and yes, some languages

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:45,840
just don't care.

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,360
So the question you're probably asking is "Well Clyde, tell me the syntax for JavaScript?"

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:52,950
We're gonna get there. 

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,480
For now, just understand what syntax is.

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:04,430
And that most languages or most modern languages are trying to move away from very strict syntax.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,710
And where does JavaScript fit into this?

19
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:15,050
Well, JavaScript cares ... a little. So its very forgiving, but there are some certain rules that you do

20
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,180
need to be familiar of, and we're going to get into those.
