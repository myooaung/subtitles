00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.290
If gators used to get items from the debt, what do you think, cities?

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.520
That's right.

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.640
Cities used to modify dates will to change them.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.600
It's available on all the methods we've just previously seen and to use it, all you need to do is use

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.430
the keyword drum roll.

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.300
See, NA.

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.820
Let's go see some examples again.

8
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.260
I want to start with a blank sheet again because I want you to start coding with me.

9
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.720
I want you to start remembering the syntax.

10
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.820
Let's now look at sic methods.

11
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.460
And again, let's say we've got a birthday variable.

12
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.580
Remember, we have to use a new key word on a date.

13
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.890
And now let's create our own birthday.

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.660
Remember, the first argument is the year it says both born in 1985, in January and again, JavaScript

15
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.830
starts at zero six.

16
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.040
Jan is zero not one and let's say is born on the 15th of January, and we can load this chart and you

17
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.690
can see that's exactly what we've got there.

18
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.680
But now say that user made a mistake.

19
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.290
All he wants to go and update is birthday profile because instead of writing 1980, he mistakenly What

20
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.180
a muppet, he wrote 1985.

21
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.880
So user update Thursday.

22
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.910
And this is where we can use six methods and I'm not going to go through them all.

23
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.330
A lot of them, like I did forget, it's going to be too cumbersome and boring for you.

24
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.080
So let's just do one.

25
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.570
Let's just say he wants to update.

26
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.950
His year.

27
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.610
To 1990.

28
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.950
And that's actually changed the year, and they birthday variable to 1990.

29
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.860
Log it off to the screen, I'll prove it to you.

30
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.130
So there we go, it's change from 1995 to 1990, and we've done it using the set method.
