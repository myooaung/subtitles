00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.400
We are going to be getting into something called coercion, but before we do, you just need to start

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.200
understanding operators.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.090
And again, don't get intimidated by all these fancy words. You already know what an operator is. An operator

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.910
just performs an operation on single or multiple values. It just performs an action.

5
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.630
Let's look at the example 1 + 2.

6
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.610
That plus sign is the operator.

7
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.250
I told you, you would know what the operator is already.

8
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.090
And in programming languages, the one is referred to as the "left operand" and the two is referred to

9
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.230
as the "right operand".

10
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.700
And in this case, because there are two operands, that plus sign is known as a binary operator.

11
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.610
But anyway, we'll get into that shortly.

12
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.550
Let's keep moving on.

13
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.520
We've seen a lot of operators at school, you know, the plus sign, the multiplication sign, the minus

14
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.130
sign, divide sign etc. And in JavaScript, you get different types of operators.

15
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.230
You get these ones that we're familiar with, you and I from school, but you also get others and they're all

16
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.840
classified within their different types.

17
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.210
I'm not going to go into detail now into each one.

18
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.350
You'll see it throughout the course

19
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.570
we're going to be using these different types of operators,

20
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.650
so feel free to pause the video and go over these in more detail.

21
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.600
I'm going to go over them very quickly here.

22
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.710
So one type of operator is called the arithmetic operators.

23
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.380
Another type is assignment operators.

24
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.960
You've got boolean operators.

25
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.200
And you've got string operators.

26
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.620
And spoiler alert, this might be a bit too advanced right now, but we are going to get into the stuff

27
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.100
later

28
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.830
and that is what's known as the ternary operator - that just assigns a value to a variable based on some

29
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.730
condition aka: if this condition is true, give it this value,

30
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.620
otherwise give it another venue.

31
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.470
So it's quite a cool new operator, which we will see later on in the course.

32
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.370
Something else I just want to touch on quickly before we move on, and this is important for you to

33
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.690
understand, it's the difference between unitary operators and binary operators.

34
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.710
Remember, at the beginning we had 1 + 2, and I said that the plus was a binary operator because it had

35
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.670
two operands.

36
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.370
So what's a unary operator? An operator is unary if it only has a single operand. 

37
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.600
So let's take the example "x = -10". 

38
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.730
That negative, that minus sign, is a unary operator. And, an operator is binary 

39
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.630
if it's got 2 operands - we've already seen this.

40
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.050
So you could say that the plus sign, and others actually as a matter of fact, exist in two forms. 

41
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.910
In the binary form and in the unary form.

42
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.050
And let me quickly show you an example of how JavaScript treats these two.

43
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.180
But just bear in mind the one that JavaScript prefers, or the one that JavaScript gives preference

44
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.400
to, is the unary operator.

45
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.500
Let me show you an example quickly, so you'll understand.
