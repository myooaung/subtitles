00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,610
Woohoo (party sounds)
You've just written your first JavaScript and we are not gonna stop,

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,810
so let's continue.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,010
Let's open up the browser again and let's go to the Console.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,040
Something now I want to introduce you to, is a built in JavaScript function, and that function is very

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,960
well known and it's called an alert.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,660
Now, when you tell the computer you want to run an alert, the computer sometimes needs certain

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,210
parameters from us in order to understand, or in order to execute fully that function or

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,670
code. With an alert, you need to give it text because basically what you're telling the machine is that

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,110
you wanted to give the user an alert.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,540
But what do you want to tell the user?

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,620
What is the alert all about?

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:49,370
So let's write "alert()", OK, and you'll see also later in this course, we go into functions and functions

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,470
have to ... in order to execute a function, you have to enclose it within these parentheses, these brackets.

14
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,070
So let's just alert the user "hello world".

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,710
Now, what do you think's going to happen when I push the return key or the enter key on a keyboard?

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,170
Yeah, well, yes, it's going to come up with the Alert tab that we all have learned to love to hate.

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,390
And there it is, my "hello world", and it comes up with an alert.

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,420
But check at this. If I push "Ok"

19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,660
Check at the return value. Undefined.

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,730
What is that undefined?

21
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,940
Well, er, I'm going to share something with you now. It's awesome.

22
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,380
I'm going to drop some knowledge.

23
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,180
Let's check it out.

24
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,700
We ran the alert function and alert function is just one of many JavaScript commands.

25
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,680
So let's write it out on the screen.

26
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,450
And lets dissect it. Let's understand why the return value was undefined, and let's understand

27
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,230
this alert function, JavaScript function, in a bit more detail.

28
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,020
So the alert word we know that's just a special JavaScript function.

29
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,830
And I didn't have to go and write the machine code or tell the computer what to do because JavaScript

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,720
as a language has already done it for us.

31
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,590
Now remember, and we spoke about this earlier, every expression, and an alert is just an expression -

32
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,410
you're telling the computer what to do, in this case shown an alert,

33
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,950
it has to return something, and in this case, the alert hasn't returned anything.

34
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,270
And if it returns nothing in JavaScript, that just means undefined.

35
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,740
Simple as that.

36
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,420
And that's why that "undefined" word came up below our function call.

37
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,660
And most people will stop here, but I just want to go into a bit more detail just so you understand what

38
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,230
we're doing here.

39
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,600
In between the brackets, we've written "hello world". In JavaScript, and you're going to hear this in

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,490
other programming languages as well,

41
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,160
this is termed a string literal.

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,890
I know it's a weird thing to call it, but it is just called a string literal. Well, what is a string literal?

43
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,850
It's just a way of defining a kind of value called a string.

44
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,270
And what string? Well, a string is just text in programming.

45
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,560
I don't know why

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,540
we don't just call it text.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,160
You know, why do we call a boat a boat?

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,340
I do not know, its just the way it is. And a string literal tells JavaScript that the text is data

49
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,000
and it's not part of the code. Otherwise,

50
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,320
how does JavaScript distinguish between the words we wrote there, the "alert" and "hello world".  Hello world is

51
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,420
not an inbuilt JavaScript function, its just words you and I have created. And putting it in those little

52
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,940
blue speech marks, tells JavaScript

53
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,200
"Hey, this is a string literal."

54
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,810
It's not part of the code, it is just data.

55
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,460
And yep, yeah, the brackets, the parentheses,

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,730
we've already said to execute a in JavaScript, you have to enclose it in parentheses.

57
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,540
It's just a rule that we have to remember.

58
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:52,610
And you can see here we ended the statement with a semicolon. Just like in English, when you have to

59
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,790
end every sentence with a period or a full stop, its

60
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,620
the same as JavaScript.

61
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,170
You have to end every statement with a semicolon.

62
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,160
Now strictly speaking

63
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,750
you don't have to use a semicolon.

64
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,030
It's just good practice to use a semicolon.

65
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,840
That's what I do.
