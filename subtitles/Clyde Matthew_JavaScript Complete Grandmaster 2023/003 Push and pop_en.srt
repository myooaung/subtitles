1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,740
The best thing is with these things is to just keep going with examples, because then you start feeling

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,350
more intuitive around it and you start becoming more comfortable around this concept of race.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,850
So let's get into it.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,830
Let me give you a practical example.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,420
Let's say we've got a shopping list and we want to enter.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,250
We want to delete things from the array.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,820
We want to access the linked properties.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,320
How would we go about doing all these things that have a lot?

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,980
Well, the first thing is, let's create a shopping list.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,610
And you can call it what it what you want.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,890
Let's just call it shopping list.

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,360
And this is to necessities.

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:34,870
Look.

14
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,530
Breed.

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,420
If we console.log this out.

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,010
Let me start Quokka.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,560
There you go.

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,430
I'll raise the milk, bread, beer.

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,090
What about if we wanted to access properties in our well, we can access those properties with square

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,600
brackets.

21
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,290
Any initially?

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,060
We wanted to access mock.

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,660
Let's console.log shopping list.

24
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,670
Open and close.

25
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,870
Square brackets.

26
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,240
And remember, we've got an exercise in memory, and it's going to be at the starting point, which

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,140
is zero.

28
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,420
And that gives us look, if we wanted to excess beer, what would we do?

29
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,110
That's right.

30
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,550
We put two.

31
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,940
That would give us beer and with a raise, we can also override values very easy.

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,960
Let's override Belize.

33
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,550
That's our shopping list.

34
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,850
Instead of milk, it's by hook.

35
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,210
Now, if we console.log our array.

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,290
It's replaced milk with Coke.

37
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,960
And what about accessing the linked property?

38
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,840
What about if we wanted to add elements into this array if we suddenly remembered, Hey, I also need

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,740
to buy toilet paper?

40
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,710
Well, what about if we didn't want to buy beer anymore and wanted to get rid of that?

41
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,060
How would we go about doing that?

42
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,580
Well, let me show you something quickly.

43
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,090
Let me just open the console and look at this any array that we create.

44
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,240
This just creates the number, right?

45
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:23,910
It can be an injury free console of this art, and we open up this little thing here and we access its

46
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,540
prototype.

47
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,540
The coolest you could what we have access to.

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,980
We've got access to the method and the push method and mimic the examples of what those are now.

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,420
Let's go back to our I.D. and let's access the linked property.

50
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,130
How do we do this?

51
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:49,620
Well, you'll see if we go back to the console, you'll see here that we've actually got a Lynx property

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,870
automatically on this array.

53
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,750
On any array we create, we've got the property directly.

54
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,560
So if we go back to our I.D., we can access it.

55
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,250
Let's just console console.log shopping list.

56
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,950
In this case, the length of.

57
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,030
Three, we got three items in our air.

58
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,940
It makes sense.

59
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,170
Milk, bread and beer.

60
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,090
Well, in this case, coke, braeden beer.

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,240
Let's now add an item to our shopping list.

62
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,430
How do we do this?

63
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:24,220
Well, arrays have an in-built method called push in JavaScript, and it literally pushes an item onto

64
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:24,700
the array.

65
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,940
So let's exercise our own shopping list.

66
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,610
It's going to have a push method on it, and you can see my ID already tells me that this happens a

67
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,360
new element to array, and it returns a new length of the array.

68
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,230
So let's push.

69
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,470
Toilet paper.

70
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,810
Until right now, if we console.log this out.

71
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,180
Our shopping list.

72
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,620
And there you have it.

73
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,360
OK, but now say we made a mistake and we've got enough toilet paper, we want that thing out of there.

74
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,290
What do we do now?

75
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,710
Well, that's where my cup comes into it up.

76
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,490
It's remove an item from the array.

77
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,820
Again, that's access our shopping list.

78
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,230
Now we want to pop.

79
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:16,450
And this permitted waste removes the loss element of the array, which in our case is the toilet paper.

80
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,630
And now, if we console.log our shopping list out.

81
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,860
Toilet paper is nowhere to be seen.

82
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,380
Great.

83
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,180
I hope you having fun.

84
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,000
But there's more to raise than this.

85
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,990
Let's get into it.
