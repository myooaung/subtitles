Hi.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.130
Just wanted to quickly give you a motivational video.

3
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.490
I know sometimes it can seem slow, and I know this first section can be a bit frustrating because it

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.830
seems like it's a bit repetitive.

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.590
Seems like I keep trying to nail some points home.

6
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.970
Trust me, it's going to pick up. We're going to get a lot more complicated later.

7
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.870
But I am a firm believer in understanding the fundamentals like the back of your hand, before we get

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.190
into more complicated topics.

9
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.530
So there's a method to my madness, so please bear

10
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.920
with me. 

11
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.240
Please keep going.

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.470
You've done so well to get this far. And I just want to take this opportunity as well to say, please

13
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.380
leave me a review. It really does help me a lot.

14
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.500
But don't just give me 5 stars for the sake of it.

15
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.830
If you don't like the course, if you feel like I can improve.

16
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.680
Tell me. I worked really hard at this.

17
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.350
I'm really happy to learn. I'm really happy to improve.

18
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.780
But enough said. You're probably getting very bored of this by now.

19
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.610
I just want to say, well done.

20
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.340
Keep going and I'll see you in the next lecture.
