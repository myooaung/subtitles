00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.280
Who I am and and you know what, the Sun Lego's sweet, sweet success.

2
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.960
Well done for getting this.

3
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.210
Seriously, I just wanted to pause, take a step back from whatever it is we are learning about, which

4
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.780
is objects.

5
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.530
And I just wanted to say thank you for getting this far and well done for getting this far.

6
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.850
You know, most people I've learned in life don't bring that extra hard work.

7
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.590
They don't go that extra mile to get a hit and so well done.

8
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.550
I'm very impressed cooking during the course, and I just wanted to say you might be even getting a

9
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.550
bit frustrated in the sense that, you know, we're learning about objects, learning about the different

10
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.680
ways to create objects struck the functions of the syntax.

11
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.200
And you might be thinking, Oh, it's all good and well, like we've created people objects.

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.730
We've created motorbike objects.

13
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.510
But how do we actually extract this value and put it in the object?

14
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.740
How do we work with data from a user interface point to many users on our website?

15
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.960
And let me just say you'll get they need to learn to walk before you run.

16
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.320
You need to understand objects, how they work on X's properties and see properties, how to work with

17
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.440
it.

18
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.240
And I just want to say, we're going to get there.

19
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.630
We're going to understand how everything fits in later.

20
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.880
But for now, just enjoy sit back.

21
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.390
And I just wanted this video to be a bit of a and video Get going.

22
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.320
Go get a coffee.

23
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.680
Go get a coke, whatever suits your fancy, and I'll see you in the next lecture.
