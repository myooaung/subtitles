00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,920
Before we can actually appreciate the full power of JavaScript and how the computer actually reads the

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,080
language and converts it into machine code, I just thought, you know, you need to understand what

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,290
a processes is. And it's quite funny because

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,970
I mean, I spent a lot of my time starting out coding for probably two to three years, and I don't even really,

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,830
truly understand what a processor was.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,740
So I'm just going to give you a quick overview.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,090
OK, what is a processor?

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,840
Again, you just need to realize that programming is not difficult.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,640
There are just lots of little pieces.

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,280
A processor is just one of those little pieces. And a processor is just a small chip, okay.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,540
It's like a machine that resides in computers and other devices,

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,440
your cellphones, radios etc and its basic job is just to receive input and provide output.

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,480
OK.

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,040
In other words, let me rephrase it another way. I'll say that its a tiny machine that works in tandem with

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,890
electrical inputs. AHHHH but you probably just want to see one, right? Because you don't fully understand

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,930
it and you're sick of all this jargon.

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,730
OK, well, here's what it looks like.
(swoosh sound)

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,150
Cool.

19
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:13,540
Just a small chip. Okay, so you could say that the processor is the brains of a computer. It performs

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,010
arithmetical, logical input / output operations of the whole computer system.

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,220
And we give this processor instructions, right?

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,190
Because the processor to work needs instructions.

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,920
But unfortunately, and this is what sucks with processors and sucks with machine languages, is that

24
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:37,120
not all processors are the same and not all speak the same language. Which means, we really don't want

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,450
to be diving into writing at a processor level, right, at a low level.

26
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,250
Which brings me onto our next topic.
