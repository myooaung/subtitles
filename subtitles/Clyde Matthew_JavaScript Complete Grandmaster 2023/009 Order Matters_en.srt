00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:07,080
Whew, okay, remember in the previous lecture, I mentioned that when the browser parses your HTML, it

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,300
goes from the top to the bottom.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,630
Well, I just want to tell you why that's important.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,070
And and when you start writing JavaScript, you need to think about this.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,080
Here's the body tag. 

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,540
Let's just say we've got a paragraph.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,159
And in the paragraph, we want to replace this text with JavaScript.

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,980
So, say we've got this text and we want to replace it with JavaScript.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,580
And remember, it parses from top to bottom.

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:49,890
So what about if we try and replace this paragraph before the browser has have rendered the paragraph?

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,390
Surely that won't work.

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,330
Well, let's see. 

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,050
Let's put JavaScript at the top.

14
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,860
And again, don't worry about syntax for the moment, I just want you to understand the concept of what

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,430
we're trying to learn.

16
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,330
Let's just define ... all we have to do now in JavaScript is we have to somehow identify that paragraph tag, so

17
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,040
let's do that.

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,470
Okay, we have to, this actually returns a collection, so we just want to access the first element of the

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,940
collection, which is the element itself.

20
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:39,890
And let's now go and replace the innerHTML with this:

21
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:48,590
"This is new text replaced by JavaScript".

22
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,030
Should we try and run this?

23
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,160
Let's give it a go.

24
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,310
Let's see what happens.

25
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,220
So again, let's click on Go Live.

26
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,930
What do you expect to see?

27
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,600
Something didn't work, because look, we want to replace this text with JavaScript, and obviously

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,290
it hasn't happened.

29
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,120
Let's inspect the Console and we've worked with the console already, and this is why it's awesome.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,410
Have a look here when you encounter errors like this -Uncaught TypeError, cannot set property 'innerHTML' 

31
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,700
of undefined. And it even tells you where in you code

32
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,960
this has happened. If you click on that,

33
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:39,370
It says, this is undefined, "para". We've defined "para" as getting the tag name paragraph.

34
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,950
So let's switch back to our IDE.

35
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:50,950
So what's happened, is the browser has encountered this tag, getElementsByTagName("p"), and 

36
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,290
has tried to find it, but it hasn't got there yet.

37
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,210
So this is undefined when it happens.

38
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,620
And how I can prove it to you, is let's just move the script tag to the bottom.

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,830
All we've done is we've moved the script tag below the paragraph tag. And what happens now, do you

40
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,120
think, if I go back to the browser?

41
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,860
"This is new text replaced by JavaScript".

42
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,510
How cool is that!

43
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:26,540
I hope you understand now the importance of where you place JavaScript does matter in your HTML.
