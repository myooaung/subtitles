1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,600
Once we have a date, we have both methods we can use on that date and the methods we return a part

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,770
of the date we're interested in, how do we access these methods?

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,910
Well, each of these methods will begin with drum roll.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,570
This shoot over to visual studio code and show you a few examples.

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,450
So let's have a look at some of these gitte methods.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,620
Gates methods, and I'm going to try to make it a bit practical here because I know these things can

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,550
get a bit theoretical.

8
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,930
Let's say we want to create a user's birthday.

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,590
And let's say on this website we've designed, when you sign up, you ask for your birthday, your month

10
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,600
and your day, and let's just say this user puts 15th January.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:49,870
Five.

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,170
First thing we need to do to remember is what?

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,510
Yes, we need to use the new keyword and let us now establish his birthday into a variable.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,170
So let's say late birthday equals new date.

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,940
And remember, one of the ways to create a date was to be very specific.

16
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,690
We could put in the year, the day, the month.

17
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,010
So let's do that, 1985.

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,740
Let's say it's January, and remember, January starts at zero.

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,700
It's why I keep stressing January, and it's just it's the 15th of the month.

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,030
Now we've got the user's birthday and his birthday variable.

21
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,210
I'll prove it to you, we can talk Thursday.

22
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,430
And the it is on the screen, it's you, some get me, it's not, let's say we want to get the day of

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:33,820
the month.

24
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,770
How would we do this?

25
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,070
Well, let's see our result by using console.log.

26
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,970
The first thing we need to do is exercise our variable date variable.

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,240
Now we want to use one of these great methods.

28
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:01,380
And for the day you used date and you can even see here the I.D. Visual Studio code is really giving

29
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,120
me a head that says get dates is the day of the month using local time.

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,360
So I can do that, and the 15th, which is 15th of January.

31
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,460
What about if we wanted to get the year?

32
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,250
Let's try this again.

33
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:24,480
We need the birthday variable and get full, here's the method in 1995, so you can see how easy it

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,670
is to use these gifts to access different things.

35
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,070
What about the month gift month?

36
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,110
I'm sure you know how to do this now.

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,970
Console.log, we is our birthday variable and we get month.

38
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,380
And its era, which we know is January.

39
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,190
But remember, we don't any of gates.

40
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,560
We've also got six.
