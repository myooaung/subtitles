The last part of this bonus section, I just want to clarify the different types, all the different

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.550
versions of ECMAScript, because this can get very confusing for a lot of newcomers in this space.

3
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.940
ECMAScript releases new versions of the language all the time, okay, and ES is just short

4
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.720
for ECMAScript.

5
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.050
And every time you see "ES" followed by a number, that's just referencing a version.

6
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.430
So ES1, ES2, ES3 and ES4, those were all old versions that have now been abandoned. ES5,

7
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.190
on the other hand, was released in 2009.

8
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.680
And then we've got ES6, which was released in 2015, and ES6 used to be the popular name, but ECMAScript

9
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.540
decided to move to annual updates, and they don't want us calling it ES6 anymore.

10
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.580
So they said the official name of it is ES2015.

11
00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.540
So, whether you refer to it as "ES6" or "ES2015", they are basically the same thing.

12
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.099
And why ES2015 is the most popular version, is

13
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.050
because most browsers, or pretty much every browser now supports ES2015, even though they are later

14
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.000
versions of ECMAScript right now.

15
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.550
OK, so that's just a bit of awesome knowledge.
