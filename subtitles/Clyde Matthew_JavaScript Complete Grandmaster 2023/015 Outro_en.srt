1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,500
So you want.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,040
He was.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:12,700
You are down all that, sit back and enjoy the spoils of what you just learned, it has been incredibly,

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,170
creatively awesome to be with you.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,020
Thank you for supporting me.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,240
Thank you for getting this far.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,390
I know it has been.

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,210
It's been tough and I hope you enjoy this teaser.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,650
There's a lot we haven't covered in the critical rendering path, but like I mentioned, it's beyond

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,610
the scope of this course.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,850
I just wanted to get a very high level overview of how the browser works.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,330
Kind of.

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:37,690
We are experts in what is age it's all about and then how JavaScript specifically fixed the critical

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,150
rendering path in some things we can do to improve it.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,680
Now we didn't discuss the future or we didn't discuss preload and custom motivations.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,550
And the reason for this mentioning is just beyond the scope of this course.

17
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,460
But if you are interested in learning more, do the course.

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,560
If you're not, that's perfectly fine as well.

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,930
You've done incredibly well to get this call.

20
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,430
Thank you again for supporting me, man.

21
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,820
I'm excited to do another course.

22
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,030
I'll let you know in another courses that keep going and good luck in your career.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,750
I'll see you soon.
