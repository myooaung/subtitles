Old school, I know is boring, but in order to understand why the Web has developed as it has, we

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.590
do need to understand it.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.210
So what is the old school way of how browser used to fetch data from a server?

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.379
Well, you probably can guess browser would have sent a request.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.740
It would then have to wait, and then it would receive a response.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.590
And Page 13 this way was very intuitive.

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.630
If nothing went wrong in the assets that made up the page would be downloaded and displayed on your

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.100
computer or device.

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.900
So let's see how this looks.

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.600
So your browser would send an HTTP request to your server?

11
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.760
It would then wait.

12
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.360
Your server would then process that request, and it would then send an HTTP response to your browser.

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.470
This was the way that websites worked for many years, but this had a number of flaws.

14
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.160
And the biggest flaw by far is and that's why it's no one page reloads.

15
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.640
What do I mean by this?

16
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.300
Well, think about it whenever you wanted to update any part of your website, for example, to display

17
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.740
a new set of products, or if a user wants to update his profile, his name or age, the entire page

18
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.520
to load again.

19
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.780
And this practice is very resource heavy and results in poor user experience, especially as your website's

20
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.520
become larger and larger and more complex.

21
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.210
OK, Clyde, that's great.

22
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.080
I know the problem.

23
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.260
But what is the solution?

24
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.970
Well, it ought to give you a spoiler alert.

25
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.700
So you're going to have to wait until the next lecture to find out.
