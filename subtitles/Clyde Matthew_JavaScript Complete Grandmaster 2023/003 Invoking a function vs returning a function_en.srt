00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,460
Before we move on, just a very quick example, remember how we just said that to invoke a function,

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,020
you need to include the double parentheses.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,600
Well, what happens if you don't include the double parentheses?

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,170
Let me show you.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,410
So let's define our function called wolf.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,650
And all this does is console logs to the screen.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,260
Now, if we don't include the parentheses.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,130
What's going to happen?

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,159
Well, in this instance, it's not going to execute the function.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,150
It will literally return the function itself to you.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,750
So just bear that in mind, if you want to create instances of this function and put it into variables,

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,510
make sure you don't put parentheses behind because as soon as you put the parentheses behind it executes

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,950
their function shape.

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,970
If we go wolf and we put in parentheses, what's going to happen?

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,460
Well, it's going to console.log with the screen hope that makes sense.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,620
But there's plenty more to go.

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,460
Let's get on with it.
