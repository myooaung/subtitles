1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,160
So objects are a whole bunch of name and value piece.

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:12,590
We were just discussing a minute ago about what an object is, and we concluded that an object is just

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,520
about everything.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:14,900
So what does this mean?

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,270
Let me give you an example before we start coding and you might be thinking, Nah, man, you know,

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,720
we went through variables.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,090
Why do we even need objects illustrated by an example?

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,930
So has Wally.

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,560
We've got his details and remember how he had his details and variables.

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,910
Named Ballons favorites logged in all as well.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,720
But what happens when you've got thousands of users on your website?

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,240
And if you randomly pick a container from your pantry, how do you know who that belongs to?

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,510
And even if we look at the variable name, it could be multiple Walleys on your website.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,350
So how do you know that Dick Cheney is actually the one related to these containers?

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,830
Well, this week objects come into it, and what I mean by that is you almost have to ring fence all

16
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,910
these variables.

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,970
And put a label on it and say, this is the general look and feel for every person on our website.

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,480
Once you've done that, you can assign variables and you can create multiple instances of this person.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,820
So for all one key example here, this is a real person on our site.

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,730
You can ringfence him and you can say that he's an instance of a person object.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,150
And in the heading, it sees an object is just a whole bunch of name value pays.

22
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,350
That's all that this means.

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,260
So his balance of funds is a name, and the values that he for is he logged on to the site.

24
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,740
It's the name of the variable and then knows the value.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,850
So you can see objects and variables all kind of related.

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,720
You can actually say objects are a whole bunch of variables within it.

27
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,060
And how do we create this new Wally object?

28
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:03,020
Well, if we define the structure being a person object, all we need to use is the new keyword and

29
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,180
we're going to be getting into the new keyword later.

30
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,699
But just understand when you do that, you've literally created a new object, a new instance of that.

31
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,200
And yeah, we've defined it into a variable called Wally.

32
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,260
Don't worry if you don't understand too much or if I'm losing you a little bit, you're going to get

33
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,020
so familiar with this by the end of the section.

34
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:28,990
Just take a step back, take a deep breath and just remember all an object is this it's a way to store

35
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,650
your daughter.

36
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,130
And because we can still dots an easy way, it makes it easy for us to access their daughter as well.

37
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,970
It's all an object is don't get lost in all the detail.

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,320
Let's move on.
