1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,650
So humans aren't very good at working with binary numbers used in machine code

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:05,610
right?

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,290
I mean, come on, who wants to go and write programming languages in 1's and 0's.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,620
So that kind of make sense. And then we take a step back and we go, cool

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,400
okay, so all these programming languages are really just a compromise.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,340
They really are just trying to bridge the gap between us as humans, right, trying to just create something

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,890
legible so we can understand it, versus what a computer needs in order to function, which is zeros and

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,250
ones.

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,340
And some languages are closer to this machine code than others.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:43,080
And these languages are kind of akin to what's known in the industry as an assembly language. And an

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,170
assembly language is known as a low level language.

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,310
Why is it called low?

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,210
Well, because you can kind of think about it that it's as low as, you know, to the process as possible,

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,120
other than literally writing zeros and ones.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,590
And yes, yes.

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,600
You know the question you might be asking now is

17
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,910
"why don't we all just write assembly languages,

18
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:03,480
right?"

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,520
It's executed much quicker by the computer, and this is because the computer can directly understand

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,110
assembly language and no transponder or translation of the program is required.

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,710
And you also use efficient use of some primary memory.

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,770
So, yeah, lets just all learn assembly language.

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,160
My only hesitation, and it's a very massive hesitation, is that assembly languages are difficult.

24
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,790
OK, it's very machine dependent.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,220
Machine language differs from one computer to another.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,290
It's difficult to program, it's difficult to modify, and it's very error prone.

27
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,630
So for me, in this day and age, I don't think there's a real need to learn an assembly language.

28
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,070
I think, you know, you get such good programming languages, JavaScript being no exception at all.

29
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,350
It allows you to actually write code

30
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,150
you understand, others understand

31
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,350
but that is equally powerful as any other assembly language out there.
