1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,150
This is what I'm talking about.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,630
A nice cup of hot coffee in my hand and a lovely "rusk".

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,850
This is what a rusk is.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,260
Whoa, it doesn't get much better than this.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,780
It does not get much better than this.

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,310
Wow, that is phenomenal.

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,640
But anyway, this is a new section entirely on the JavaScript console.

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,550
Well, actually, it's just a console in your browser.

9
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,730
This is not the only place we can write JavaScript by the way.

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,090
We can write it in any text editor, even in Microsoft Word.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,980
You can write JavaScript basically anywhere, but as a developer, you're going to be working a lot in

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,580
the console.

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,190
And that's what this class is all about.

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,320
It's about the console. We're going to be discussing things a little bit deeper as well.

15
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,760
We're going to be looking the JavaScript alert function.

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,480
We're going to be looking at ... the BOMB. 
(ticking sound). 
The BOM.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,800
What is it? We're going to get into that shortly.

18
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,430
And very importantly, we're going to be looking at a method on the console called 

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,490
LOG. And this allows us to log not only errors to the screen, but it allows us to log results, it allows us to actually

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,740
give feedback to the developer. And you're going to be using it a ton,

21
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,300
so that's why it's so important.

22
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,450
But log() is not the only method on the console, but others.

23
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,310
And that's what we're going to be looking at in the section.

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,720
And I just want to encourage you to please go through each part of the series in order.

25
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,870
This is going to be getting more and more complex as we go on.

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:50,010
But, enough said, grab your coffee, a nice hot cup of coffee, and I'll see you in the next lecture.

27
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,520
That is a really, really good. Adios.
