Great, we're getting into it, but now you're probably wondering what is the difference between an

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,740
object constructor versus an object literal?

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,950
We know that an object constructor has to start with the finding object and we do this with the function

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:21,110
keyword and then an object literal just needs the opening closing curly brackets.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,000
Both methods above creates a JavaScript variable called person.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,050
The main difference, though, is what you can do with that variable with a constructor function.

7
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,930
You can create multiple instances with the new keyword, but with the literal notation, you only get

8
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,310
a single object.

9
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,130
Now this is just theory enough of it now.

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,810
Let's go code.

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,770
I'll show you what I mean.
