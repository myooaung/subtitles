00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:07,610
Before we go further, you need to understand that JavaScript is a scripting language, and what I mean

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,610
by this is that JavaScript cannot run on its own.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:18,220
In fact, the browser is responsible for running JavaScript code. And we alluded to this earlier and I

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,370
have mentioned it before,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,360
that JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that it's run on the browser. It's run on the

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,980
computer's machine on the fly.

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:36,410
So when a user requests an html page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser.

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,940
It is then up to the browser to execute that (JavaScript) code.

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,960
And of course, we know the main advantages of JavaScript is that all modern web browsers support JavaScript.

10
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:53,080
So you don't have to worry about whether your site visitor uses Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox,

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,840
Safari, JavaScript will be supported.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,750
And the good news is that JavaScript also runs on any operating system, including Windows, Linux,

13
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:08,860
Mac, and we are going to be talking about engines, JavaScript engines, these things that run JavaScript

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,030
code in the browser.

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,100
But you know, engines can be complicated, but the basics of engines are easy.

16
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,370
But anyway, I don't want to get into much detail now on engines.

17
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,230
I just wanted you to understand JavaScript is a scripting language and it cannot be run on its own.

18
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,540
It has to be run by an engine on the browser.
