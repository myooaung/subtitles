1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,410
Oh, man, I've got such a nice cup of coffee right now.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,770
That is beautiful.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:14,770
And in Africa, we've got these little, I don't know, I mean, we call them "rusks".

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,140
It's like bread.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,680
It's like dry bread, and you dip it in your coffee.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,100
It is just phenomenal.

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,260
This is like a treat.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,000
So I'm just stopping now quickly.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,380
Let me finish this and then let's get started.
(music plays)

10
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,800
All right, Done!

11
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,710
Well done for getting this far in the course.

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,270
Seriously.

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:53,990
Keep going.

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,900
You're going to be learning a lot as we go along. 

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:05,390
And now we're getting into the section of syntax. And you just need to sit back, relax and enjoy it.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,110
But, you know, one of the serious things in learning syntax and all that is, data types in JavaScript.

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,840
And data types are very important because you've got to think now, take a step back and just think about

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,470
a website.

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,340
When you go and visit a website,

20
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,760
all it is, is it's a whole lot of data.

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,260
Yes, we put CSS in there, we put images in it to make it look pretty.

22
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,030
But think about it from a computer's point of view, it's just data.

23
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:43,800
Sometimes there are images, sometimes there are words on the screen, sometimes there are numbers on the screen and why

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,730
it's important to learn about data types, is you as a programmer, 

25
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,440
you and I, we need to know how to deal with these different data types.

26
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,640
We need to know what we can do with different data types.

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,190
We need to know what functions we can apply to them.

28
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,410
And that's what this section is pretty much about, so we're going to be doing a lot of coding.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,080
We're going to be learning about semicolons, white spaces, return statements, but we're going to

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,889
spend a large portion on the different types of data types. In particular, 

31
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,710
we're going to be talking a lot about strings, numbers, 

32
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,510
we're going to be talking about

33
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,140
null, we're gonna talk about undefined. We're going to be getting into a lot of this stuff and it's exciting.

34
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,810
So enjoy.
(music starts)

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,630
Sit back.

36
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,630
Go get a coffee. Get pumped up.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,830
And let's start.

38
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,030
(music continues to play in background)
