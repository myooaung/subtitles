00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,440
When we program, we are giving the computer instructions to process one line at a time in the order

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,020
that we give the computer those instructions. And just so you're aware, there is an old phrase in this

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,110
industry, in many industries actually, called GIGO.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,980
But basically, it stands for "Garbage In, Garbage Out". And in programming languages, we write these

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,960
instructions by writing what are called "statements", and these statements are kind of like sentences

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,400
in English. And you can imagine if I go "didly didly dillydoo click uh oheeeh", 

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,090
That means nothing, and it's the same as programming languages.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,440
The computer is going to process

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,320
what you give it. If you give it junk, it's just going to throw it back at you.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,860
But at the end of the day, I just wanted you to be familiar with this terminology.
