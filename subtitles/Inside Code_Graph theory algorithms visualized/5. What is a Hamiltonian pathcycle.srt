1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,680
Imagine that you're playing a platform game where 
there are locations that you can move to through  

2

00:00:04,680  -->  00:00:11,400
kind of bridges. Each of these locations contains 
a key, collecting a key increases your score by 1.  

3

00:00:12,120  -->  00:00:18,540
But, once you step on a location, it falls a 
few seconds later so you cannot go back to it.  

4

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:25,320
This game can be represented with a graph, 
locations are vertices, and bridges are edges.  

5

00:00:26,160  -->  00:00:32,160
Obviously, you want to maximize your score, you 
want to traverse all locations to collect all  

6

00:00:32,160  -->  00:00:38,280
keys and go back to your initial point. 
But each location can be traversed only  

7

00:00:38,280  -->  00:00:44,340
once because it falls a few seconds later. 
So starting from the level's entry point,  

8

00:00:44,340  -->  00:00:50,340
you want to find a way to traverse all locations 
exactly once and go back to the entry point.  

9

00:00:51,540  -->  00:00:57,900
In graph theory terms, starting from a vertex 
start, you want to find a path that traverses all  

10

00:00:57,900  -->  00:01:06,000
vertices exactly once and goes back to start. And 
this is what we will learn to do in this lecture,  

11

00:01:06,000  -->  00:01:15,240
get ready to learn about Hamiltonian paths 
and Hamiltonian cycles. In previous lectures,  

12

00:01:15,240  -->  00:01:21,240
we learnt about Eulerian trails and circuits, 
a Eulerian trail is a trail that visits each  

13

00:01:21,240  -->  00:01:27,600
edge exactly once, and same thing for Eulerian 
circuits but it must return to the initial vertex.  

14

00:01:29,940  -->  00:01:35,580
But what if instead of edges, we wanted to 
traverse each vertex once, we want a trail  

15

00:01:35,580  -->  00:01:43,800
that traverses each vertex once. Such a trail is 
called a Hamiltonian path, a Hamiltonian path is  

16

00:01:43,800  -->  00:01:51,780
a path that traverses each vertex exactly once. 
Same logic for Hamiltonian cycle, a Hamiltonian  

17

00:01:51,780  -->  00:01:57,720
cycle is a path that traverses each vertex 
exactly once and goes back to the initial vertex.  

18

00:02:00,240  -->  00:02:06,060
Here is an example, we have this graph, and here 
is a Hamiltonian cycle, you can see that it starts  

19

00:02:06,060  -->  00:02:14,940
from A, it traverses every vertex exactly once, 
and goes back to A. You can also see that some  

20

00:02:14,940  -->  00:02:20,580
edges have not been traversed, but it's not 
a problem, the condition is on vertices only.  

21

00:02:22,800  -->  00:02:28,860
And for Hamiltonian path, here is an example, we 
kept the same graph and cycle and just removed  

22

00:02:28,860  -->  00:02:35,520
the last edge, we got a path that starts from 
a vertex, traverses every vertex exactly once.  

23

00:02:39,000  -->  00:02:43,440
In previous lectures we had 
semi-Eulerian and Eulerian graphs,  

24

00:02:43,440  -->  00:02:49,800
here we have semi-Hamiltonian and Hamiltonian 
graphs. The definition should be easy to guess,  

25

00:02:49,800  -->  00:02:54,600
a semi-Hamiltonian graph is a graph 
that contains a Hamiltonian path,  

26

00:02:54,600  -->  00:02:59,160
and a Hamiltonian graph is a graph 
that contains a Hamiltonian cycle.  

27

00:03:01,740  -->  00:03:07,500
Note that Hamiltonian paths and cycles can 
be present in both directed and undirected  

28

00:03:07,500  -->  00:03:13,440
graphs. In directed graphs, the Hamiltonian 
paths and cycles must obviously be directed,  

29

00:03:13,440  -->  00:03:19,320
we must be able to traverse each vertex 
exactly once by considering direction of edges.  

30

00:03:22,080  -->  00:03:27,120
For Eulerian trails and circuits, we could 
know about their existence by checking simple  

31

00:03:27,120  -->  00:03:34,920
conditions, which can be done in linear time. We 
can even find one in linear time, by using the  

32

00:03:34,920  -->  00:03:43,560
algorithm we learnt about. But, is it the case for 
Hamiltonian paths and cycles? Definitely not. The  

33

00:03:43,560  -->  00:03:49,620
problem of finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph 
is NP-complete, which means that exact algorithms  

34

00:03:49,620  -->  00:03:55,200
we currently know to solve it are in exponential 
time, we will see one in the next lecture.  

35

00:03:57,180  -->  00:04:01,260
Even for knowing if a Hamiltonian 
path or cycle exists in a graph,  

36

00:04:01,260  -->  00:04:07,080
we may need to actually search for it, 
which is in exponential time. I mean,  

37

00:04:07,080  -->  00:04:11,040
there are some conditions to say that a 
graph is Hamiltonian, but it's not enough.  

38

00:04:11,700  -->  00:04:19,020
For example we have Dirac's theorem, it says that 
given a graph G, if every vertex has a degree of  

39

00:04:19,020  -->  00:04:27,180
at least n/2 where n is the number of vertices of 
G, then G is Hamiltonian. This condition can be  

40

00:04:27,180  -->  00:04:34,320
easily verified in linear time, and if it's true 
then the graph is Hamiltonian. But, if it's false,  

41

00:04:34,320  -->  00:04:39,720
it doesn't mean that the graph is not Hamiltonian, 
this is why I told you that it's not enough.  

42

00:04:41,460  -->  00:04:48,900
Let me show you an example. We have this graph of 
6 vertices. Here are degrees of its vertices. All  

43

00:04:48,900  -->  00:04:55,500
of them are at least n/2, so by using Dirac's 
theorem, we can say that G is Hamiltonian,  

44

00:04:55,500  -->  00:05:03,840
which is true, here is a Hamiltonian cycle. Now 
let's take this other graph. Not all degrees of  

45

00:05:03,840  -->  00:05:09,840
vertices are at least n/2, but it's still 
Hamiltonian, here is a Hamiltonian cycle.  

46

00:05:12,420  -->  00:05:18,780
In brief, when all degrees are at least n/2, 
we know that it's Hamiltonian, but when the  

47

00:05:18,780  -->  00:05:24,420
condition is false, we don't know, it can be 
Hamiltonian just as it can not be Hamiltonian.  

48

00:05:25,440  -->  00:05:29,580
It's different from Eulerian graph where 
if the two conditions are respected,  

49

00:05:29,580  -->  00:05:34,860
we know that it's Eulerian, and if it's not 
the case, we know that it's NOT Eulerian.  

50

00:05:38,340  -->  00:05:44,220
We can even find conditions to say that the graph 
is not Hamiltonian, for example when a graph has  

51

00:05:44,220  -->  00:05:50,640
isolated vertices, then we cannot reach them, 
while the Hamiltonian cycle must pass from all  

52

00:05:50,640  -->  00:05:57,120
vertices, we deduce that it's not Hamiltonian. 
But it doesn't mean than a graph with no isolated  

53

00:05:57,120  -->  00:06:02,640
vertices is Hamiltonian, we don't know. And 
this is why I told you that it's not enough,  

54

00:06:03,240  -->  00:06:08,640
probably the only way of truly knowing if a 
graph is Hamiltonian or not is by searching  

55

00:06:08,640  -->  00:06:15,540
for a Hamiltonian cycle, which takes exponential 
time. Hence, the problem of just knowing if a  

56

00:06:15,540  -->  00:06:22,920
graph is Hamiltonian also takes exponential 
time. We've reached the end of this lecture  

57

00:06:22,920  -->  00:06:28,560
where we learnt about Hamiltonian paths and 
Hamiltonian cycles. See you in the next one.
