00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.040
[Autogenerated] first off to start using AWS codedeploy,

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.950
we're gonna need to make sure that your users got some access and permission,

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.330
so allow the right access levels to use.

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.230
The service is quiet.

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.100
We're gonna also look at some service roles that different address service's

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.080
will need to hook into Kota Boy in the first series of demos.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.440
I'm glad to show you how to allow and restrict access to codedeploy in I Am.

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.380
I'm also going to show you how to create service roles for

9
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.050
each of the address service's we'll be using such as Easy

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.030
too Easy s and finally Lunda.

11
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.950
Okay, so let's jump straight in.

12
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.640
I'm on the I am council right now.

13
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.950
A cz you can see I already have ah user's set up.

14
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.770
My user has a ministry for access,

15
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.520
but to create a specific access to 80 burst codedeploy,

16
00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.840
What we could do first is we go to groups will and create a new group.

17
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.440
I call this one code to paly access.

18
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.130
Next,

19
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.180
we're gonna need to attach from permissions and

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.720
policies to this group for user s.

21
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660
So let's have a look at what Cody play ones that have

22
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.490
to offer codedeploy full access.

23
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.370
Sounds perfect.

24
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.340
And exactly what we need.

25
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.100
You can also create deploy access.

26
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.320
You just need users to only be able to deploy.

27
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.440
Let's go ahead with full access.

28
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.760
Okay, So there's our group.

29
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.980
Let's have a quick look at the policy to see what's involved at the top.

30
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.310
We can see codedeploy has ever been allowed on all resources.

31
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.940
You'll also notice some other commissions as well,

32
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.970
Such as this costar notifications.

33
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.440
Read my access.

34
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.140
Ah, another code style one.

35
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.830
Uh, no one.

36
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.240
Finally, an asset s s one,

37
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.880
but we're gonna also need to have access to the address service.

38
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.690
Is that hook into codedeploy?

39
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.040
So let's attach more policies.

40
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.840
We're gonna first.

41
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.740
You need the easy to grow.

42
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.910
So that's attached that one.

43
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.010
Easy to full access.

44
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.130
We're going to also need the E.

45
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.000
C s full access rule.

46
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.270
Finally, we're going to need the lander one as well.

47
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.930
Actually, that's not the s free book.

48
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.240
It one on there for good measure too.

49
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.430
Okay, so that's attached all of those policies.

50
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.450
You should be able to see them all there now and then.

51
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.950
It's a simple as adding users to a group, so here's my user I made earlier.

52
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.920
I will add him to the group that that's it.

53
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.450
Also, for I am for the next part of demo,

54
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.280
we're going to create codedeploy service rolls.

55
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.390
Service rules used to grant permission is the address service

56
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.540
is so it can access a do best resources.

57
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.750
We're going to need three service rolls you want easy to one for E.

58
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.510
C s.

59
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.760
I want for London.

60
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.390
Let's go ahead and create that rule.

61
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.360
We're going to create a best service role.

62
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.520
So that's the 1st 1 Well, I'm gonna select codedeploy,

63
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.420
and I'm also going to select the top top option out of these traces,

64
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.630
which handles all of the easy to resources.

65
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.750
Next.

66
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.440
Let's take a look at the permissions in that policy attached to this role.

67
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.200
We can see here that we've got cloudwatch access

68
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.930
easy to or scaling low balances.

69
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.580
Resource group tagging on also es and s will hit next.

70
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.940
We don't need to cut any tax.

71
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.930
Will you can do Let's go to review and then let's give it a name.

72
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.220
So let's say a service role,

73
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:17.320
Kurt deploy easy to and then we're gonna create that role.

74
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.070
Perfect Let's do the same for PCs and also for London.

75
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.040
We're gonna hit the eight of us service roll again.

76
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.000
We're gonna select code apply again.

77
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.240
This time we're gonna slept codedeploy easy.

78
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.810
Yes.

79
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.540
Let's have a look at those permissions to see what's included.

80
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.190
So, Senator, last one,

81
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.840
we can see all the components that we're gonna need

82
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.740
A ll the access to resources.

83
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.200
I don't need any tax review.

84
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.490
Right?

85
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.430
Let's give it a name.

86
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:59.110
So service, role codedeploy and you guessed it E.

87
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.530
C s okay.

88
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.520
On one last time.

89
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.270
Let's do the London one great role.

90
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.740
A diverse service codedeploy and the Lambda next to permissions.

91
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.320
Let's have a look.

92
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:24.140
What's included there Similar again only for this one, though.

93
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.480
Next attacks don't need any tags Review.

94
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:42.540
That's giving the name service role codedeploy London Perfect.

95
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.000
So you know,

96
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.500
we have all of our access and permissions set in the eye on dashboard.

97
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.100
We've got a group with a role on.

98
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.980
A policy is attached to allow a user to access code

99
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.160
deploy on all the resources we need.

100
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:05.000
And then we've also set up service roles for codedeploy that gives access to easy to e CS and finally London
