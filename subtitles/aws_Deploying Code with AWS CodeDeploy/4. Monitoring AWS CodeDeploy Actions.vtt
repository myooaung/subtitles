00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.250
[Autogenerated] in this next section,

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.640
we're going to cover monitoring a dressed codedeploy actions on events.

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.000
These were important to keep your environment secure

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.680
like we talked about earlier on.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.880
We can show how to order events if needed.

6
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.790
Okay, so in this next Walt Fruit, we're going to take a look at the A P.

7
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.480
I call logs and cloudtrail for codedeploy actions and events.

8
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.420
Let's jump right in.

9
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.600
Okay, so on the AWS codedeploy dashboard,

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.120
we're going to create a test application just to show some events in cloudtrail.

11
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.440
Let's hit create application.

12
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.430
What is going to call it test?

13
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.290
We just got a selectee see, too.

14
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.240
I'm gonna hit great application.

15
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.140
So now this will show up in the Cloud Trail dashboard,

16
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.240
and we can see the events and who's done what?

17
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.820
So let's switch.

18
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.190
There was a cloud trail dashboard.

19
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.990
Now you should have previously set this up.

20
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.570
I think it's outside of this course.

21
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.050
It's really simple to do, so it's really intuitive.

22
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.620
We're going to go onto event history.

23
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.090
We're going to select an attribute.

24
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.040
We're gonna click events source.

25
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.640
We're gonna hit and type in codedeploy so that we can view

26
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.970
all log entries from codedeploy actions.

27
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.480
So you can see here that I've previously created and deleted

28
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.220
codedeploy We can see who's done that.

29
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.640
The route user, if you see the source I p addresses my address.

30
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.800
Um,

31
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.800
we could see the same for over actions to This is gonna be

32
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.250
really great for when your orders in code apart and you can

33
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.820
see who's doing what and where.

34
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.560
Okay, first module finished.

35
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.170
That wasn't so bad, was it?

36
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.310
On?

37
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.070
We're well on a way to becoming co deployed pros.

38
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.300
Let's have a quick recap.

39
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.130
What we just covet gave an introduction to the service and then an overview.

40
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.710
We had a look at managing permissions.

41
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.000
We've I am. And then we had a look of auditing with cloudtrail.
