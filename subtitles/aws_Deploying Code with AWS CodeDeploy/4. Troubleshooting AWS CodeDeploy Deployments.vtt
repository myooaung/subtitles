00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.640
[Autogenerated] Okay, so now we have Sam and code to play set up.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.510
Let's look at how we can troubleshoot some of the some deployments on.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.910
Have a look at Cloudwatch, too.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.310
In this demo, we're going to cover the following.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.780
We're going to have a look at the cloud watch events and

6
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.930
also the log day Aaron Cloudwatch Rico, deploy to.

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.690
Okay, so let's jump right in and let's take a look.

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.710
Okay, so here I am on the cloudwatch dashboard.

9
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.840
Let's jump over to the lock section here.

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.740
We can view some of the locks for our CO to play hook that we created earlier.

11
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.500
Unless take a look at one of them.

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.050
Now we can see here everything that's happening within our deployment.

13
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.810
So here we can see it test in our function that we deployed a nap Js on.

14
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.100
We can see that it returned the correct Jason that we wanted to see.

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.060
Ah, we can see everything.

16
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.530
Really.

17
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.830
We can have a look on me that I am that's attached to it.

18
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.760
We can see that when it was starting and when it finished,

19
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.280
whether it was a success or not.

20
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.610
So this would be a really good place to go and have a look.

21
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.460
If your deployments were failing from here,

22
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.890
you could get an error message and then you can fix

23
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.280
the code and then redeploy it.

24
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.910
Okay, so let's jump over to the events and have a quick look at that, too.

25
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.250
Similar to other modules, we can select our code of place service in here.

26
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.210
We can then are alerting for any events and actions that

27
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.690
happen that we've just seen in the looks.

28
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.780
This is great for us.

29
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.720
If we want to monitor deployments or, you know, we want to see what's going on.

30
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.910
It's a great little system Tau have in place.

31
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.610
I'm not going to cover it too much as we covered it up in previous modules.

32
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.620
So let's continue on.

33
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.230
Let's have a quick recap.

34
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.140
We just covered deploying code with Codedeploy and Lambda.

35
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.110
We prepared all the prerequisites that we need it.

36
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.100
Such a setting up the 81st Sam Cli.

37
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.980
Then we deployed to Lambda using eight of us Sam and we also update it.

38
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.130
We had a look at some of the application hooks that we can have in place to

39
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.060
test our applications on how that ties into codedeploy on.

40
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.000
We then had a look at the cloudwatch logs to see how we could debug our deployment.
