Select this rectangle because I want to customize it and show a hover on eat.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.050
First of all,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.900
I go to feel and change the color,

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.850
as you can see here.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:03.150
Then go to the previous part and select and Jill down and the circle around it.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:13.850
Make a copy off that by holding all key and move it to the down.

And really,

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.250
is it from the previous group?

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.750
Put it here.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:30.250
So we have two new elements here.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:41.150
Just drag them to the top after Dad's here dragged them to the down,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.550
zooming because they are really small.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.850
So leg rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise to have a different icon,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.450
then make a group for them.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:59.150
Renay me to icon so we have a new group in layers panel.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:08.450
Then you can align the icon group to the center off rectangle horizontally,

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.350
using the options bore as you can see in the video.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.550
Then on their knees,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.480
the icon group we need to a title.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.400
So I select textile and it start to time something here.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.510
For example,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.950
your war title here.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.740
The color is white,

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.290
but I'm going to change it.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.350
So I get to the top from this part,

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.850
set a new collar for that and use this green color,

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.650
then got to the current lay year.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.340
After that,

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:56.150
you can align the text to this center off rectangle horizontally.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.370
After that,

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.870
we need to cost demise thes sparks.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:17.280
So I double click on the layer and use struck in layer this time panel so you can set a new

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.550
color for a strike and press OK.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.050
Another option that you can use is drop shadow.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.220
From this panel,

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:34.260
you can apply a different drop shadow for the bunks.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.320
You can play with measures for example,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.750
capacity size or other options.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:46.050
After that press OK to apply,

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:59.030
Do you drop shadow and struck so you can see the difference here After applying these

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:03.050
layers tiles underneath your war title Here,

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.220
we need to a description,

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.660
so I create the text box.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.470
Then I go to here and copy thes progress.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.250
After that,

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:22.010
go to the down here a game.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:29.510
Select the new layer and paste the pride graph.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:37.790
Here you can read use the phone size and I'm going to organize it.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.560
Using takes options.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.950
Here you can change the vertical distance between lines.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:49.550
We have some extra lines.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:55.250
I'm going to remove them from my text layer.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.960
After that,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.410
you can use alignments again.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:08.350
So this is the bunt we have created in this case.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.110
All right?

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.550
Almost we have done and finished.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:22.810
Just go to layers panel because we should organize these layers.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:29.050
So select all of them by holding shift key and create a new group.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.220
You can't rename it as you want.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:31.990
For example,

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.650
featured works and use a color for the group.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.850
This far is complete now.
