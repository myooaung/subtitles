So liked this a star and then select the first.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:16.340
A star after that's like the last one and use distributes where to call and horizontal

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:32.150

Change the caller to yellow in this case.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:49.010
So let's find a good yellow color for he spar press,

00:13:49.010 --> 00:14:06.840
and I'm going to change the extra color to another because the previous collar waas really

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.450

It's go to the Second Star and do the same.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:33.350
You need to just copy the yellow collar numbers or values and pay stem here.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:42.350
So we did it for four stars here.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:48.650
I would like to change another element here,

00:14:48.650 --> 00:15:05.950
so I said the phones to later and on their knees this tars I'm going to tie so I can type

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.850
dollar or,

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.280
better,

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:11.850

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.880
$589.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.250
Here.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:20.750
It's just a number for price.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:26.150
You can type any number or value here,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:37.850
so let's have an equal vertical distance between our elements,

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.080
just unit to press control.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:47.150
Key to see the numeric values like this.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.150
After that,

00:15:49.150 --> 00:16:02.350
you can't drag each element to the down or to the top to place it in the best position.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:18.750
After that's come over the rectangle tool and 38 thesis rectangle here and just let's find

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:27.450
each elements position because I want to organize layers panel and create a groove for Then

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.150
I create a group for stars.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.850
After that,

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:39.050
you can turn off or on each elements,

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:46.690
so let's on group layers because all right should make some changes here on again.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.760
All right,

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:54.430
make it grew for these stars again.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.060
I make another group,

00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:06.660
and after that are you can align vertical centers for the screw again on group layers

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.170
because we need that too.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.010
It's for alignments.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.470
And after that,

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:28.850
you can on grew a bit scroll down a little bit and I'm going to add another element here.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:40.570
So I would like to add to call the actions at the bottom off my direct time.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:40.850
Guilt.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:50.850
So I select rounded rectangle and create and new on here.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:56.950
So after your have created,

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:08.590
make another copy off this around the rectangle by holding on ski and position it on the

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:18.950
right side off this rectangle so we can reposition it as you want.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.160
It depends on you.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.400
After that,

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:32.050
come over the rectangle tool and creates a new rectangle here.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:45.850
Then I'm going to height guidelines to see mine project better.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:50.660
He sees what we have done till now.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:19:03.860
So select this great tango these two rectangles and make a group for them.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:13.290
Dan select theist rectangle by holding control key to align horizontal and vertical centers

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.550
for these groups.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.330
Right.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:24.660
Click on this layer and select on group layers come over the tax stool.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.810
And so,

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.760
like Theus surrounded rectangular,

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.350
start to tie.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.850
Ah,

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.550
time till here,

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.850
for example.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:42.820
I'm going to type at two cart in this case,

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:54.250
so I need to change this call to action Caller on on changing,

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.350

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:05.920
And after that I need to set a wide color for these texts and read.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.760
Use the phone size.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:13.660
Then I'm going to use alignments in this case,

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.310
and you can see the difference.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:20.450
Go to this rounded rectangle again.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:27.160
Come over the rounded rectangle tool and sets a new collar for DATs.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:42.330
Go back to text tool on tap to create a new text layer and type view more here so I can use

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:46.260
alignments again from the Options bar.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:56.050
I would like to add a Nikon beside each call to Action's text,

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:05.260
so I go to flat Icon that's come and search per chase here.

I need to resize it,

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:43.850
and then I select this rectangle by holding control or command key and position this icon

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:49.350
on the left side off this round a rectangle.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.920
After that,

00:21:51.920 --> 00:22:03.140
I need to resize the tax layer and I can use a line.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:08.450
Vertical centers for these types again,

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:21.710
so got to via more and chanted to view detail.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:26.280
Then go back to flat.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:40.400
I conduct calm and search for another icon Here I searched for a detailed icon and D.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.350
C is the result.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:57.850
I select this icon because it looks good for my project and I drag it to the's stock humans

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.290
again.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:11.930
I need Teoh resize it and I do the same and position it here on the left side,

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.850
off this second rounded rectangle.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:18.870
After that,

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:34.760
reduce the phone size for view detail and drag it to the right like this.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:41.050
So Height guidelines to see this part.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:55.660
We have done the first pro docked and I did new elements on details for it.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:01.660
Just I need to create a Group four Days elements.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:08.550
So I created group here by holy In Control or Command G,

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.680
and you can't rename into,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.590
for example,

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.720
productive one.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.220
Also,

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.760
I can zoom out to see this part better.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:26.950
As you can see We have an extra element here,

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:39.160
so I should remove it from the group and a game I'm going to man could grew up here,

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:47.270
so rename it to gain to product and screw lob,

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:52.660
then duplicate this group.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.260
Drag it to the right.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.950
Exactly,

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.260
Very you can't see.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.050
It is really important.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:14.050
It takes time because the process should be finished here.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:19.350
So we have the second group.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:30.160
I'm going to change some elements and I remove the top elements off this part.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.910
After that,

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:39.850
I create a line over the price like this,

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:54.490
and I can select a line by holing control or command key and a line Vertical centers for

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:55.550
the text.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.760
I mean pricing here,

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:17.410
So let's go to add a discounted price next to the origin on price hands,

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:24.050
I need Teoh resize the phones,

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.760
the new text.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:31.910
It's not visible and we should following the reason.

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:43.950
So I need Teoh change the color to a dark blue collar.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:46.340
After that,

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.930
I'm going to type a numeric value here,

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:51.850
for example,

00:26:51.850 --> 00:27:06.060
$389 in this case on a I need to change this title.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:14.050

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:50.220
After the's progress,

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:57.760
we can go ahead to complete this project.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:07.260
Select featured product text on Change It to another one.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:12.660
I'm going to type bestseller here,

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:21.050
and I will like to set a new color for this great tango.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:29.520
And I select a blue collar for this purpose.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:42.350
After that's I'm going to change another element and it is Theis time on icon.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:52.950
So I open up flat icon dot com and type champion here.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.510
Then I resize it,

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:24.620
and I'm not worried about the position because I can select district tango by holding

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.110
control or command key.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.540
Then I select this icon,

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.760
and by using alignments,

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.450
I can position it here.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:35.660

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:34.760
I mean bestseller,

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:45.850
Then collapse these groups and organize them.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:54.850
Rename its and drag this group to the top.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:31:04.140
Just you need to see a solid horizontal line on top of layers panel.

After that,

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.450
you can release it.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:22.910
Go for this pricing option and you can change it and go to the right side a little bit.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:30.160

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:29.160
and after that I can play with this rectangle and resize it to make sure that it is soon a

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.550
