So you can see there is at this dance between these rectangles that you can get hope from

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.350
left arrow key to solve this problem.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:10:01.150

Just let's change the last shake collar and you can see the difference here.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:20.630
After applying a few changes here.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:28.010
I need another row underneath the 1st 1 before dance.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:33.450
I at more details to this part.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.330
For example,

from transform tool by holy in control or command T again.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:28.640
Select all these layers and make a copy off them by holding on key Dragged em two down life

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:35.950
thes and select fleet horizontal from transform tool.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:41.250
So we have this part here,

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:46.050
but a few details and changes are remaining,

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:52.750
so let's zoom in to focus more on this part.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.810

Then scroll down and you can see these rectangle has a different color.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:16.350
And what was the reason that I changed the color?

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:24.750
It is because I want to show the harbor on this item.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.250
