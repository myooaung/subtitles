00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.650
This is where I want to add an explanation about the work.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:14.110
So I come over the right time going to and create it with decides it.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.050
I'm going to position it.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.450
I should be careful about the position.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.750
It's really important in this case.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:36.480
Danso mean go back to rectangle,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:45.550
go to feel and select a dark color to see that everything is okay or not.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.150
Then you can set a new color for this shape.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.640
Use Ah,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.850
horizontal guideline and positioning at the bottom of the rectangle.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.330
Go to this.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.800
Fine.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.000
I would like to use these markups.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.550
So I select both big and a small and I drag it into my project.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.350
They are large.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.150
I should resize them.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.650
Then I am going to drag them to the right.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.930
My gang.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:41.550
I should resize now I'm going to divide my shape and rectangle into two parts.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.950
The left side on the right side.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:55.540
The left side goes for these mark ups and after that I'm going to create a groove for the

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.730
Ma.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:10.250
Cops come over the text tool because I would like to I feel the right side with elements.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:18.150
Set the collar for the text Dan,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.750
you can type more here.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.550
For example,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.650
what is our work?

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.000
Resize it and increase the phone size.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.150
Change their phones too bold.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:45.450
This is the title that I need for this part.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.650
I can add a question sign here.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.400
So very some problems.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:04.350
I shoot solve it and I can drag it to the top a little bit.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.160
I'm going to get help from other parts,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.840
For example,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.410
here or here,

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.450
this paragraph is better.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.710
So I selected and copy it.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:30.340
And I go back to this layer underneath the title.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.650
I'm going to create a text box.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.760
After that,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.050
I paste the paragraph that I have copied before.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:54.550
Then I select both text layers before I want to dragged into the right or to the left.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:02.380
Go to phone our some that calm and search for a plus.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.650
Icahn.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:14.750
This is where I can find lots off icons here.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:27.550
So wait a moment and search more to find the best one.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:38.060
Then go to the page and copy that's select text tool and change the phones to phone our

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.500
some free solid.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.470
All right,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.450
go ahead,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.350
then paste the belief icon.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:59.050
Increase the phone size from the options bar and set a green collar for that.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:10.150
After all these works select,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.750
he is paragraph,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.780
copy it,

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.750
then pasted here next to the loss I call.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:30.950
Remove some words from the line because we need Onley one line in this case.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.400
After that,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.750
select the belief icon by holding control or command key.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:44.230
Go to the text layer and select Align vertical centers from the options board.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.600
After debt.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.650
Make some copies from the first line by holding all key.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:01.750
After that Goto Layers panel to recognize each layers position.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.010
For example,

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.880
these two layers are related,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.050
so make a group again.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:25.850
Do it for I know there one and a gang chair off or on.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:40.050
So here we have problem because we have not placed layers in true group.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.050
And again I do it.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.200
Police.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.620
It's too related elements,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.640
you know,

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.780
I grew up on.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.290
Each group contains a gleeful icon,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.950
and it tanks layer here.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:03.850
So here we have four different groups that we can use.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:09.770
Distribute where to call centers from the options bar,

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.950
as you can see.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:25.660
So make some changes in each group and remove some wars or elements from each one and you

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.200
can customize it yourself,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.740
for example,

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.400
here to remove this part,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:43.550
then collapsed the groups and we have four difference lines for the explanation.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:51.450
Go to Ray Tango tool and create a rectangle on their knees,

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:56.270
the last explanation or lying.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.060
This is a kind of call to actions.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.520
I will like to add to this part.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:10.050
And then I open layers thawing and employ some struck for these shape.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:16.270
I can set a new caller for the shape from collar P.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.050
Care as you can see.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.650
Then I can change the opacity and press OK,

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:28.300
then I can applauding guidelines again.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:38.650
Then I go to text tool and Tamp to activate a new text layer and type via more.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:43.380
Then I should go to phone us on that com.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:51.500
So from the search bar I am looking for and I'm Gil icon.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:09:02.730
So here I can find and select this one from this panel I can copy Theis Kalief icon.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:10.350
Then I got to text and said the phone to phone our some free solid.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:17.200
And then I paste the belief icon here by Holy In Control or Command V.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:25.210
Then I can use font size to increase the phones.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:35.540
And I use alignments in this case to align vertical and hearts and told centers for these

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:40.490
elements inside the rectangle on.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.950
Then I can't select this.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.990
Markoff and I will like to resize it.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:56.820
I can use transform tool by holing control command T.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.280
And then I used shift key to resize it.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:11.030
Then I collapsed the group I am good two layers panel select all the elements except the

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:19.790
rectangle because I want to use a line Vertical centers option and then I can on group

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:26.050
layers because I want to select all of the elements.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:35.220
Then I create a new group and rename it to work and set a new color for the group to

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:41.650
recognize it better in future tanks were watching this video.
