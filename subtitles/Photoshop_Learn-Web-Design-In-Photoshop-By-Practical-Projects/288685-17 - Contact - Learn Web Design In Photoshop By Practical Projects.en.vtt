So I drag them here and position them then on their needs.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.740
These icons,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.380
I'm going to add a description.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.150
So I a scroll up and select these paragraph.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:10.050
Then I copied and go back to this text layer and activated by double clicking on takes icon

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.050
.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:21.510
Then I paste these paragraph here so I can drag it to the left or to the right or position

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.850
it as I want,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.980
then Khaliq,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.600
on this social media icons.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.720

Add contact information on their knees,

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.180
The paragraph.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:52.350
So my tap on the screen to activate and you text layer and type some titles here,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.910
for example,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:08.170
Address line one Dan address line to It's not important to position them on the left

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.480
because we can use alignments in this case.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.330
So just type some articles here,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.850
or some contact informations such as country phone number,

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.850
fax or email.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.550
And I'm going to do that here.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:49.610
So we have these elements select on these elements by holding shift G and aligned them.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.550
Hardison Solly to the left.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.150
So we have this elements aligned.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.350
Go to these text layer in layers panel.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:13.800
I'm going to add another elements and parts on the right side,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.750
So start from here.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.180
Create this rectangle.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.750
I'm going to add a contact four here on the right side,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.950
so I need to a rectangle and a good color for that.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.400
You can use layers tiles,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.170
for example,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.550
a stroke in this case,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.050
and you can set a new collar for D a stroke.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:56.300
You can't chance the blending mode here or size or any.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.250
Are there parameters here?

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:12.680
You can at inner shadow in this part and lets me change the color for stroke.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:23.650
And we have these elements make a copy of it by holding all key and drag it to the down.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.450
So we have the second box here.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:36.350
You can use guidelines to have more accuracy here.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.510
So after you've done again,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.550
make a copy off the second rectangle.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.950
Hold all key and drag it to the down.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:59.550
You can use distributes and alignments,

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.340
of course,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.850
Distribute vertical E history rectangles,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:24.150
then go to text layer and select text tool type some articles and titles inside these boxes

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.150
.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:41.530

00:06:50.950 --> 00:07:04.910
And the last one is phone on Select the history takes layers and a line damn horizontally

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.450
to the left.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:12.810
We can work more with alignments.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.300
In this case hand,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:25.850
it is clear you can see the video and follow these steps as I do here.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.250
So scroll down a little bit.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:36.080

drag it to the down and put it in the right position like this.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:57.650
They're selected and expand the height like this.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.550
I mean,

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.650
expand it.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.750
Vertical e.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:16.900
Make another copy off the third rectangle and position it underneath the big air rectangle

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:16.900
.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:30.300
Select a different color for dance time something and this call to action,

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.380
for example,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.750
submit now set a new collar for that,

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.450

It is time to organize our layers,

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:10.080
so let's find each layers position,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.950
