00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
in this tutorial,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.980
I'm going to introduce the customers who have trusted to the company or the website.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.750
So I go to this fire and select on the layers,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.350
drag it into my project.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.050
Then I need to drag damn to the left.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.340
Let's all be.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.930
It's after that.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.450
I scrolled down to see these parts better.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.450
I activate background layer.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.650
Then I come over to rectangle tool,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.850
and it start to create a rectangle around the Legos.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.250
As you can see in the video.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.460
After you have done,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.650
apply it by pressing each ER on your keyboard,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.510
then double click on the layer to upon layers.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.000

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Apply some struck for dance.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:24.550
Set a caller 48 Change the opacity and make some changes again.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.050
So we have it here.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:36.090
Go to move Tool Select on the logo's holding shift.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.370

Make it group for them.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.250
Rain Amytal logo and boy ideas work.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.610
You can a line this group horizontally and vertically to the center off rectangle.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.520
Go back to Le Groupe,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.340
select these logos and create a new group.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.050
For them.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.150
It's means you should separate one logo from the others.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.390
Goto this Lego.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.270
After that,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.650
go to adjustments at the bottom off layers panel.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.950
Choose you and situation.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.950
Move you as saturation.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.800
All paradigm the new group for logo and create clipping mask,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.650
then de saturate it completely.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:47.350
So we have this nice effect year close Tap group from the's icon and collapse this group.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.650
Scroll down a little bit.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.700
Go to a rectangle tool,

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.050
create a new rectangle here,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.480
put this numeric values into boxes,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.630
then drag the's rectangle.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.550
Here.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:26.020
Applied ads by pressing Peter so we have Theis shape.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.750
Go to feel and change the color.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.010
Just remember to place a hard,

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.450
cental guideline here.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.250
Dan set it to white collar.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.650
Zoom in to see this project and this part better.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:54.750
I'm going to create some book says or rectangles.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.750
Four.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.800
This part.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.550
This part is called Counter.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:13.050
I want to add some counters for customers I tens or ratings for the website.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.250
After creating a rectangle,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.950
I come over to a collapse stool and create a suitable here.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.460
I set a new collar for that double.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.230
Click on the layer.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.950
Go to stroke from layer style.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.350
Apply a struck using Theis numeric values.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:53.210
Let's expand it a little bit by holding control or command T and using shift key.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:01.850
Then you can align the circle horizontally to the center.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.490
So we have this box created.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:14.750
Then we need some title on their knees.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.150
This usual.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.950
So I come over to textile,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.750
start to type something.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:35.670
I tied works here and enquiries the phone size I get help from Move tool to reposition my

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.450
elements.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:44.690
This is good in my idea so we can work on the rectangle again.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:52.250
Go to attack stool top on the screen to activate it and type a number.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.950
It's option on and it's up to you.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:02.020
So I'm looking for a good color in this case,

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.780
and I'm going to a peak,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.680
this green color and we have it year.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.350
This part.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:20.420
We can make wards text larger and again.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:26.550
For the number we have a fear steps to complete this item,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:35.350
so drank each element to the top or to the down to reach a good position for them,

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:42.450
work on the rectangle or on the text layer.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:50.920
Then you can get help from alignments on the options bar to align each element horizontally

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.350
to the center off the rectangle,

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.350
as you can see here,

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:04.300
really it some changes here in the layers panel.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.750
But before DATs,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.450
we should organize layers panel,

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:16.900
select related layers and place them in a group.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.370
Before that,

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:29.250
you should recognize each layers position so turn on or off each layer to see it visible.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:37.300
After all these works,

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:45.350
select these layers by holding shift key.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.190
Make a group for them.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:53.350
Why holy and control or a command G Rename it as you want,

00:07:53.350 --> 00:08:03.450
then make a copy off piece item.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.980
It seems we have some problems.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.150
Layers panel.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:20.150
So we should go back to this group because we have an extra item into this group.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:27.350
Right click on the group and select on group layers.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:36.850
Then select these four elements and again create a new group for them.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.550
Chapter a ploy or return.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:51.850
Then you can get him from all key to drag it to the left or to the right.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:09:00.300
Or you can duplicate this group by holding control or command J Do and drag it to the right

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:06.150
to create the second I turn.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:15.390
We have some unfinished works again duplicate the second layer.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:20.890
Drag it to the right using move tool.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:31.450
Do the same for the last one position it here,

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:41.650
right on the edge and press enter to apply dance.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:47.130
We have four same boxes.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.450
So we should change something here,

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.880
for example,

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:57.150
got to the second group and change that takes the ratings.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.050
And for the number,

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:06.800
you can add a new number open death,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.660
their group type,

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.850
and you ward here.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:18.550
I type items and change the number.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.820
And for the last one,

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:27.850
I'm going to type something new.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:34.550
Just wait a minute to type it here,

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:40.450
and I'm going to type ball years in this case,

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:49.450
a gang DoubleClick on the text icon for this number.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:55.950
So it is edible in this case and create a new number.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.850
Go to the second group.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:14.510
So lech this box by holding control key if you want to employ any alignments collapsed all

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:22.600
the groups renamed down to have an organized deck.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:30.610
Humans tap to apply that again.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:40.550
Select Theis rectangle by holy and control or command key and use alignments.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:55.620
You can do this Same for the fair rectangle that has placed here And for the last one that

00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:07.830
has placed right on the edge do this saying and collapsed the group here we have four do

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:19.420
you friend items make it grew for all of them renaming its then by this work,

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:27.850
you can align the group vertically to the sensor off the bigger rectangle.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:38.150
