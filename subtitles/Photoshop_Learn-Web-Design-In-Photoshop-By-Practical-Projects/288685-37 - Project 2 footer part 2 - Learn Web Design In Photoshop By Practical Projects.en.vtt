00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.850
Let's go to design the second part off our footer and also complete this footer and go to

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:26.550
text tool type tax widgets and position it here where these guidelines is goods around it

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:40.150
rectangle three eights and you want then go to feel and set it to this green color.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.980
After that,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.650
select textile and type,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:57.350
for example graphic In these parts it's to launch so selected by double clicking on takes

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.450
layers icon and resize it.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:10.070
Then go to the rounded rectangle and select alignments to align it to the center off this

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.450
rounded rectangle.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.650
Make a copy off this shape,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:29.150
resize it and expand it horizontally tied and all their text here.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.050
And you can type ward price for these purpose.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:44.950
Do the same and align it to the center so you can add more space.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.950
Four.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:56.450
These shape and again I need to select it and the reposition it.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.580
We need more of this design,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:10.950
so I make another copy off this shape about holding onto key and place it here.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.630
Oh,

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.850
so I can drag AIDS to the right or two left,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.850
and I can resize it.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:36.250
It depends on the word or the text that's I want to put it inside this shape.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.250
All right,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.450
go ahead and type.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.080
Oh,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.550
some as a tag here and reposition it.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:03:00.860
Select these layers and make a group for them,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:12.850
renaming Teoh tags and then make a copy off this group.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.050
Drag it's to it down on their knees,

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:30.300
the first grow or the first line and then chan some elements in the second row.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.550
For example,

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.250
for here,

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.590
change the tax too,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:44.110
are us and place it here like this.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:59.650
Then change the second shapes Position on change the tax to flat design.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.250
Select a shape by holing control or command key.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.900
They're select align vertical and horizontal centers.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.050
In this case,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.500
go for the last tag,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.950
widget and type foot dish up.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:39.350
You can't see that we have not enough the space for for the shop text.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.150
So I shoot.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:48.930
Expand the shape horizontally and I do it.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.400
Live this I expand it from the left.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.450
In this part.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.380
Hi guidelines.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.740
This is our tags region.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:19.420
Then select this one again and expand it from the left Radios.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:33.450

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.790
and it means you're hovering on.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:57.750
Eat with your mouth and this sport is complete.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:14.510
Let's go to collapse this group and then school down to add on other items and elements in

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.350
this part.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:29.750
So come over the text tool and from here is start to type and type useful links here,

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:42.150
said the corner toe white and change the phone too bold for the thickness off this phones

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.550
Zoom out to see this part,

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.970
and I'm going to make another decision for this title,

00:06:51.970 --> 00:07:00.440
and I read Use the phone size again.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.350
School down and on their knees.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:13.050
Useful links create a tiny a square by holding shift key.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:18.950
This is where I want to add lanes,

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:27.550
so I come over the text tool and I said the phone size to 14 points.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.850
Then I type Web design resource.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:47.650
Then select this rectangle and choose a lying vertical centers for the text layer,

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:59.780
and you can drag it to the left like this again through the alignment to make sure that the

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.450
text is in the good position.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.810
After that,

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:13.550
go to line tool and set the weight from the options were toe one pixel,

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:20.550
then create a line here on their knees.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:31.460
This a link where Web design resource is select.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.450
These three elements make it grew for them.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.470
Rain a me to a link one.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:51.250
Then make a copy of its Drag it down after Dad's school down,

00:08:51.250 --> 00:09:02.470
and I need more duplication off these groups,

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:10.120
So I select both groups and duplicate them.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.290
Why,

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.820
holy in control or command?

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.250
J?

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.950
Then I dragged them to the down here.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.510
I have four useful links,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.050
but I need another one.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:34.670
So I select the last group and duplicate it.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:47.950
Drag it to the down underneath the fourth useful Link collapse.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.250
The group's then select,

00:09:51.250 --> 00:10:01.750
all of them on Choose distribute vertical centers from the options bar.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:11.600
This is because I want tohave an equal distance between these groups.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:25.600
Change the tight tells for the 2nd 1 Genji to down less center and for the 3rd 1 user

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:32.750
account and for the next one,

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:46.750
The last one short code pages for short court page.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:11:05.850
Let's make some difference in here where user account is and change the corner for both the

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.050
