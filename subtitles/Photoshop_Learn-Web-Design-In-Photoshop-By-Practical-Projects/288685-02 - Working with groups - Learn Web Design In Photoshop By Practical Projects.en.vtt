00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
Let's take a look at groups on working with them in for the shop.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.190
First of all,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.250
I'm going to create to shames in these documents,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.050
and I can set a different color for them.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.890
Daniel Layers panel.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.790
Select both shapes by holding shift key.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:28.850
Go to this part and select group icon to create a new group,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.370
and you can rename it as you can see Just Wan Khaliq.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.590
You need to rename it right click on this group and like this,

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.320
you can on group it and you have another option.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.790
You can press control or command G two.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.860
Make it group for some elements in for the shop.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.180
By holding control or command J,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.550
you can duplicate it and a gang you can write Khaliq,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.960
and from this panel,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.750
you can duplicate your group.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.140
When you move a group and you see a solid horizontal line,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.850
it means that you have moved a group upper than the other one.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.960
And when you see a rectangle around the group,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.130
it means you have moved the group into another
