00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.290
in this video,

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.090
I would like to add recent news my project.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:15.750
So I'm come over through a tangle tool and create a new rectangle with this wits and height

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.750
.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.770
After that,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:26.350
I apply it and reposition it to here on their knees,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.610
the features part.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.550
And then I can press enter to apply it.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:47.050
Come over text tool and tap to create and you text layer type recent use.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:58.270
So use align horizontal sinners for the text after that,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.150
zooming by holy in control or command plus,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.750
then go to meet our team part.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:13.450
Copy this paragraph and really is it from the group?

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:26.580
Then go back to this rectangle and select the paragraph and use align vertical centers.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.090
In this case again,

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.650
select this text layer.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:45.050
Drag it to the top by holding shift key to drag straight,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.150
then press OK to apply.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.510
It's screwing down.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.250
Go to rectangle tool first along,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:07.150
position this horizontal guard line at the bottom off through a tango and create a new

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:16.510
shape here left on the edge where the first guideline is.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.850
After that,

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:27.650
go to feel and feel this rectangle re It's a gray color.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:41.550
Then make a copy of it resize it like this and go to feel and change the color to a white

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.900
double Click on the layer Goto layers.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.320
Stein apply s truck.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.650
For this shape,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:03:01.510
you can chance any parameter here so you can see the difference just in it To hide

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.350
guidelines.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:18.340
To see this part better go back to a stroke and change the position to inside and go to

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.530
caller and set a different color for yes.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.450
Struck again activates guidelines.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.730
Go to tax tool and press.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.530
Enter toe,

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:46.950
activate text layer and adjust phone size and set a new collar for that and type something

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.550
here.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:04:05.650
So I would like to time a date here and next through this date.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.150
I all right.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.490
The author's name again.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.740
I use slash.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.910
After that,

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:32.050
I type number of comments in this block or news.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.340
This part is not visible,

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.770
so I go to color,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:52.470
pick your and set a darker color for that and I can position in here on.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.060
Then I'm going to radio.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.300
Is the phone size like this?

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:04.470
Select this rectangle by holding control or command key.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.750
Go to this text and select a line.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.130
Hardison,

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.750
tall senators and align vertical centers.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:25.650
Go to this layers and select them.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:38.430
Make it group for damn and rename it to block one then guarded this group and make a copy

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:50.050
of its by holding control or command J drag it to the right where this guideline is.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:06:08.310
So be careful for this group because it's really important to place it here on the gang.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.050
We need to make some changes doing the same.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.450
Duplicate this group.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:24.150
I'm going Teoh position on under box or blunk right on the edge.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:31.850
So I select it and drag it to the right like this.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:40.450
You can see that we have free their friends boxes here.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:50.150
Just make sure that's you are placing it in the good position.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.880
Zo me in.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.250
You can see more details here,

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:05.050
and you can check the accuracy by using horizontal guideline in this case,

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.800
then a scroll down.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:20.650
Go to this layer and remove it because it waas unnecessary and extra.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:30.390
Let's check layers panel and remove extra layers,

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:37.460
and groups rename these groups to like to on block three.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.810
Then select all these groups.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:47.550
Do you replicate down and dragged them to down like this?

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:54.550
You can hold shift key to drag them straightly.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:06.250
This is where I have created six news or blog's for this part.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:12.240
I'm going to customize one off these blocks,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:19.990
so I so like the media rectangle from row one.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:28.510
And then I come over these layers.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:34.710
I mean the white rectangle and the text inside it,

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:39.350
then dragged them to top,

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.250
as you can see,

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:47.050
then press enter to apply it,

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:52.410
make a copy off this big rectangle,

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:57.750
then resize it and position it on their knees,

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.950
the white great tango,

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:16.250
then a school of and such for a great color like this and go back.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.250
This is the result.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:23.750
We have changed the caller off this rectangle.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.720
So,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:38.790
like this wreck tango that has placed on their knees the white ray tango change the color

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.850
you want and I fly.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.830
Some struck.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.550
For this shape.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:52.120
Go to text tools,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:58.050
create a text box inside this rectangle,

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:06.920
then go to this paragraph and copy that by holding control or command,

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:16.350
see and go back to the current layer that is,

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.900
attacks layer double click on text layers icon.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.650
To make some changes,

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:39.340
you can change the phone size and the vertical distance between each line and read.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:52.700
Use the text box size like this and so lack the white rectangle and use a line vertical and

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.150
horizontal centers.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:11:06.750
There is a problem that we can't position peace text layer.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.350
Very good.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.350
So let's check it.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.710
Double click,

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.450
and you can see the problem.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:20.050
We should resize the text box like this again.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:26.150
I do it and use alignments from the options bar.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:34.650
I need to do it again because something went wrong.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:42.350
I use align vertical and horizontal sinners like this.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:51.560
Go back to shape school and so,

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.650
like eclipse.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:12:00.450
Then create a circle here by hauling shift.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.360
He fill it with no color,

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:09.650
use a stroke and adjusted with the slider that you can see from the Options bar.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:22.750
Select this Sir Joe and move it as you want.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:32.890
Then select this rectangle and resize it like this.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:39.340
Position it above the white rectangle.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:44.150
When the date and comments are,

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:50.100
you can use alignments for these purpose.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.410
Care to front,

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.350
are some that calm,

00:12:52.350 --> 00:13:03.150
said for tango and select this angle rights icon.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:11.250
Go to here and select copy belief Icahn.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.750

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:30.250
Increase the phone size Teoh 36 points,

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.950
said the caller toe white.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:38.510
Then select the circle by holding control or command key.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:43.550
Go to the angle and use alignments.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:14:01.460
Come over the rectangle tool and then go to lying to change the weight and create a line on

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.050
their knees.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:09.050
These parts set a gray color for that.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:20.850
This is where I want to position something especial for this item.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:27.050
I shows we are hovering on these parts.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:31.450
How our means.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:43.850
Then you put your mouth on something so it can has a special effect.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:52.350
I'm going to zoom in because this part is important for me.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:59.950
I apply its throat for the gray call a rectangle,

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.950

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.950
The groups in layers panel select.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:20.050
I love these layers on Zoom out,

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:35.090
then dragged down to the top like this and wait moment because it takes time to complete

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:41.110
this progress and that's it.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:44.520

then use alignments to have more accuracy.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:16.390
Rename this group as you want.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.350
