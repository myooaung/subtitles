00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.390
All right,

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:07.150
let's go to create beautiful progress bars in this part,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.350
so creates a new shape here.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.060
Apply.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:28.850
It's then got to reposition its on their knees that team part so you can use arrow keys to

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.150
drag it to the right or to the left.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
In this case,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:43.050
after that's positioned is horizontal guideline,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.150
as you can see.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:57.150
Then got to ray tangle tool and create this rectangle on the last sign.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.350
Set a gray color for this J Go to feel,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:18.250
and you can find a good color from that's go to a stroke and select a caller for that

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.200
resize it.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:35.500
You can use a different color and change the position to outside and play with capacity so

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.450
we have this rectangle here.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:48.010
Just make sure Dad's rectangles position is good,

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:59.150
then zooming because we want more accuracy in this part.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.850
Go to round it rectangle and select it.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:14.940
Dan set a new radius for it from the Options bar and create around it.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:25.950
Rectangle in signed the first rectangle and got to feel set a new collar and set it to

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:36.650
green and drag it a little bit too right.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.350
Then expand the height after that go to move,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.580
tool and select the first rectangle,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.250
go to the rounded rectangle and use alignments.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.950
I'm going to add four different progress bars on the left side.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.050
The 1st 1 is almost gone.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:14.430
Just I need to add It's high until for these Progress Bar and I'm going to type first,

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:30.070
said the Front to later resize it to 24 points and said A dark blue collar for it is found

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.070
,

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.550
Then a start to type.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.550
I'm going to use capital letters,

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:46.550
so I re type it and I type our skills.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.050
Then I drag it to the left.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.600
There the first guideline s.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.780
Then I'm going to add a cost,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.150
um,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.450
title for the Progress Bar.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.150
Our skills is a general title,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.700
and this one,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.950
I mean work press is for the Progress bar.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.050
Resize it and reduce the phone size,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:35.050
then drag it to the left after that's at another Tex here and type 80% in this case.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:43.550
Then you can use align vertical centers for these text layers.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:50.470
Go ahead and zoom in tow,

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.950
have more accuracy,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.520
then again use alignments.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.750
It's really useful in any project.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.550
Select deals four elements in layers panel created group for them.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.130
Rename it to,

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.790
for example,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.650
Skeel Dan duplicate this group.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.000
Drag it to the down,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.710
and here we have the second Progress bar again.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:34.350
Do it and create the 3rd 1 Andi,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:42.350
repeat this process and do it for the last one.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:50.750
Select these four groups and distribute vertical centers from the Options bar,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.550
and we have,

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.950
and he called distance between each group.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:09.250
Then it started to make some changes in any progress bar go through the 2nd 1 and change

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.650
the size off.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.970
Rounded rectangle changed the title to,

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:16.810
for example,

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:24.510
for the show go to the 3rd 1 type a title,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.270
for example,

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.560
J.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:35.350
Corey Do the same for the last one type illustrator.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.450
For this one,

00:06:37.450 --> 00:07:01.310
go to 80% change it to 90% and four Dysart rounded rectangle make some changes because we

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.150
want four different progress bars.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.750
So I'm going to do that.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:22.550
Make some changes for the last rounded rectangle and type another percent age for DATs,

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.010
for example,

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:29.200
85% then collapse the groups,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:39.150
select all of them and put them in a group your account renaming to skills.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.960
Rename each group to,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.680
for example,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.460
skills skills to tree four,

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.820
then collapse.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.250
The scales Group
