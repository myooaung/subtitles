00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
Here we go.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.350
I'm going to create especial part that is called options.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.950
So come over through a tangle tool and creates a new on.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.030
With this new make values apply.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:27.140
Dads come over the move tool before that's a screw lump pig,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.200
a good color for their rectangle and God to the current layer.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:45.150
Drag it to the down and author Dan the background layer,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.050
so activate rectangle tool and picked this collar.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.350
This is a soft gray color for these shave,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.800
so let's fitted with it.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.950
The stock humans,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.110
and I'm going to work on this rectangle.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.130
Now I'm ready for the next step,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.750
so I go to this fire,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.450
drag this image to my document,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.990
then.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.890
So,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.550
like the rectangle and a line,

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.550
the image vertical e to the center.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.910
After that's I'm going,

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.150
Teoh feel around this image with text layers.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.950
First of all,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:59.000
I go to tax tool and try to add a title for this part,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.650
so I picked a good color.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.650
Then I start to type,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.150
for example.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.550
Here is the options,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:17.490
then do the same for the text layer toe,

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.350
aligning it after Dad's.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:30.450
We can go to text tool and creates it takes parts on their needs.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.250
The Tyto.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:44.650
So select these paragraph copy dads and go to the current layer paste the paragraph year.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:52.250
Expand the text parts a little and increase the phone size,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.550
then allying the text layer to center.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.550
So we have a new layer here.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.950
Double click on text Icon to open takes options,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.350
and you can do some changes here.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.780
And also you can get home from alignments.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.750
In this case,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:28.050
I'm going to use text tool a gang,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.850
but which a larger phone size.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:44.020
So I'll add an article here first are you.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:55.850
Type a title for the article and let's reduce the phone size and put it here.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.950
You can see that it's too much.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.590
First of all,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.050
go to call our picture,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.750
change the caller,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.780
then go back to the options,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.880
bore a gang,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.250
employ some changes for the color,

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.050
then go to this paragraph,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:28.980
duplicates the paragraph using on key and drag it to the down on their knees.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:37.750
The title Goto Layers panel and drag it here and release it from the group.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.850
So we have this tax year.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:05:01.900
Zo mean to see the's part better and position these two text layers exactly to this place,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.700
and you should be careful about the guidelines.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.450
Text layers shouldn't be out off thes guidelines.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.950
So we did this part.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:31.110
Just select these two text layers and make a copy off them by holding old key and dragging

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.350
damn to down.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.210
So so,

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:41.550
like the 2nd 1 and drag a two down little bits.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.550
So we have it here.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:50.250
I'm going to distribute vertical centers for these tanks,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.010
but before dance,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.350
I need to clear.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:05.130
Yet I grew up for Dan So create groups and he's Don then select district groups and

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:12.050
distribute recalled centers using the icon from the Options bar,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:21.150
Go to the second title and change the timeto.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:37.450
So I'm going to time and new title here I'm I typed mother design.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:51.150
So select the history titles and a line them Harz and hauling to the left.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:59.950
So this is the result change the last ones Tyto,

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.500
for example,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.190
Small,

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.950
responsive.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:19.450
You can do the same and select the history titles by holding shift you and topping on this

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:29.650
screen and do it so they are aligned hard until a to this sensor,

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:41.080
we have three groups here select all these three groups duplicate them by holy in control

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.150
or command J zoom out,

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:56.050
then dragged them to the left by holding shift G to have more accuracy.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:01.160
Then select move,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.650
tool.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:11.330
You can make sure that these groups are aligned and you can use alignments on the options

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:17.350
bar so I can go ahead.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.750
Zo mean,

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:26.450
then I can see these parts better.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:36.250
I'm going to select each title and move it to the right.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:43.450
So select the 2nd 1 through this saying for dance.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:58.150
Then I'm going to complete this part boy dragging the 3rd 1 to the right.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:06.750
So select these articles using shift G and align them hard mentally to the right.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.350
Then so lank.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:16.850
Each paragraph use takes alignments to position it like this.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:29.950
Do the same for this one and top on these icon in the options bar and go for the last one.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:35.100
A gang double click on takes icon.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.820
So drag it a little bit.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:45.020
So the last we've added text layers,

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.120
but we need more details.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.300
First the wall collapsed.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:56.750
The groups then go to this layer,

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:01.250
scroll down and zoom in,

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:21.130
get a rectangle tool and create a rectangle here After that expanded vertical e go to top a

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:33.550
little and select feel and peak this color now they rectangle is green Then go to tax tool

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.250
and type something here.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.550
For example,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:42.050
Live demo said the collar toe white,

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.450
Increase the phone size.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:11:01.210
Do the alignments for these called to action Make a copy off this rectangle boy holding all

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.850
key and drag it to the right.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:18.950
Go to feel and picked these dark blue color so the color is changed again Go to text tool

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.650
and type her chase Now Here,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:27.950
make a selection for the rectangle.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.220
Then use alignments.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:37.950
Zoom out to see thes fourth better Then go back.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:45.110
Select these four layers dragged,

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.590
um two down.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:12:02.290
Then select all these layers by holding shift key and create a new group Bring a me two

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:08.050
options So we have it here.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:22.980
This is the part Dad we were working on and it is almost finished just so mean Here is a

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:23.750
problem.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:31.750
We should align these two boxes very to Cali.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:41.950
Then select district tango to a line,

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:52.470
detects horizontally and vertically to the center and do this saying for this one then

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.750
collapsed the group
