00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.350
copyrights icon.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.450
Then you can add another takes year.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.140
So I need Teoh.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.750
Change the size and resize it and use the options bar.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.750
Then I go back to tax stool.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.090
So I did it.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.380
This starts more again.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.950
Go back.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.670
Teoh the belief icon.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.450
Resize it.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.050
Move these text to here.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.350
You can get help from alignments.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.550
Four.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:03:01.840
He is text and move the copyright icon beside the text again.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.450
You can use alignments.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.050
Go to this text layer in layers panel,

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:17.650
then come over to rectangle tool and create a rectangle.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:32.680
Here you can get help from smart guys off for the shop and set a new color for that from

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.820
color picker.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.150
You can do it.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:51.520
Screw log elite so more then from this part,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.580
I mean the slider group duplicate the menu,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:17.260
then go to the last part and really is Theis duplication here and drag it to the top.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:25.450
Then select the rectangle by control or command key and use alignments.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.350
The position thes menu exactly a year.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:39.600
I'm going to set a wide color for the menu,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.850
and this part he is almost gone.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:58.840
Just select these two elements and drag them a little bit to the down and also do it for

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.190
your lager.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.000
Mac.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.050
It grew for them.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.300
Then use alignments.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.680
It's a non option,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.910
so you can do that or not.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.610
For example,

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.850
if you do it here,

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.460
this is the result,

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.250
and you can on do that if you want.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:39.250
By holding control or command Z or any extraction that you need.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:52.140
So I'm going to apply some legal changes here to make sure that my elements or in a good

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.650
position and it is done.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:07.850
