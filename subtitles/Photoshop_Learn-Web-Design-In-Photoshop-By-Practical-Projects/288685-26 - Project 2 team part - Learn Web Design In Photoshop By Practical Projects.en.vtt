00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
in this part.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.250
I would like to introduce the team in the website.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:18.010
So as I did before I come over Rectangle tool on creates a new one here.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:29.860
Just be careful about the position you can zoom mean if you want to see this part better by

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.000
holding control or command the last on your keyboard,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.250
there are two rectangle tool set a darker color for that.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.670
Come over the move tool on the gang.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:57.160
Go back to rectangle tool and feel it with a color off course.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:05.860
I did it for the ah pair Ray Tango because we had some problems on.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.450
I shoot,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.140
reposition it and drag.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.550
It's to the right.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:30.050
This is that problem that is for the previous part and be noticed.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.250
So I solved the problem and I go back.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.450
Teoh this rectangle and drag it to the left,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.500
at least so to fit we.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:59.250
It's my documents so you can see that everything is okay.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:09.250
Collapse the previous part group and a start to type a title here,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.510
for example,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.250
meet our team again,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.450
go to alignments and select a line Hard dental centers,

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:34.040
then feel the rectangle with no color and position a horizontal guideline at the bottom of

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.970
the rectangle.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.350
You can't do the same for the top.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.670
God did that move tool.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:52.100
Make a copy off this paragraph by holding on ski,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.650
then release it from the group.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.750
Position it here.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.950
Go to tax options so you can make some changes as you want.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.760
Then use a line hards.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.950
Untold centers for the text Got to the Eclipse tool.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.790
Create a surge.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.150
Oh,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.350
by using shift key.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.150
Set a great color for it.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.860
Go to layer style.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.250
Apply a stroke For these shave.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.010
You can play read size,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.830
position,

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.980
blending mode or capacity.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.250
In this case,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:52.550
we have this part don,

00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:01.750
but I'm going to Atmore details to the shape.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:13.060
So I select rectangle tool and create a rectangle around the serial because I want to use

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.050
alignments in this case,

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.050
So feel the rectangle with no color selected Dan.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:27.940
Activate the eclipse layer so we can use a long,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.000
hard dental centers for thes purpose.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.700
After that,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:47.950
go to the eclipse layer and drag it to the town by holding shift key.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:05:01.150
And then we can at a title on their knees.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.050
These circle,

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.340
for example,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.750
and name can be place here.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.450
I tied John Doe for this one.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:20.650
We can reduce the phone size or increase it.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.850
It depends on you and your project.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.350
I decided to set it to 18 points.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:46.520
You can see that I use alignments very much because it is really needed in any project that

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.150
you need.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.950
I Q racy.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:58.950
So I'm going to at another text.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.950
Just tap to activate a new layer.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:11.430
I type Web designer here so you can do a line.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.820
Men's as you can see the vertical.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.390
The stands with me in elements is off to you.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:29.550
You can drag them to the top or two down.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.950
I'm going to make some copies off this part,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:46.150
so I prefer to be careful about the 1st 1 and do it as well as I can.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:58.450
Select these elements and put them in a group rename its two member.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.950
After that,

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.150
duplicate this layer.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.170
Um,

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.650
position it here.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.750
So we have a problem,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:26.210
and we included a title in the group that is extra and unnecessary.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:33.750
So I should go back and on group layers.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.050
Dan,

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:48.750
I grew up these layers a game that's I need Dan rename into member then duplicated.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.010
Rename me to Member,

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.550
too.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:08:01.720
Drag it to the rights and look at the position.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:07.550
I put this group because it's really important.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.650
Do this same.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.050
Make another copy,

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:19.650
drag it to the right and place it here.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:27.150
Look at the guidelines carefully.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:39.130
You can get help from smart guys off for the show that you can see they have a red color on

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.160
day will appear.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.110
When you want to position elements,

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:52.210
select all these four layers.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.250
Drag him to the top.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:04.550
It takes time for the's progress.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.450
After that,

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:14.650
duplicate these four layers by holding control or Come on Jay,

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:27.450
drag them to the down because I want to have another row off team member Andi.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.450
Place it here.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:44.300
So let's go to Costa Minds this part as well as we can at a rectangle on their knees,

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:54.650
the second throw off team members and apply a stroke for district tango.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.350
It is a call to action,

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:03.550
so I type load more.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:13.290
Then I reposition it and position it to this sensor off the rectangle.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:25.250
Then God Teoh the second Soochow from the right in a row.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:30.650
Juan and add a Poulos Icahn here,

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:39.050
set a collar for its to water where you want.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.350
I'm going to change it to white,

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.540
then select the circle,

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:51.210
go to feel and from this part said the collar,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:51.790
too.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.450
A dark blue,

00:10:54.450 --> 00:11:05.650
a screw up and select This green collar after that screwed down.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.370
So,

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.810
like this year,

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:11.350
Joe,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:17.050
and change the stroke to this green collar.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:27.580
Increase the throat size and apply it against.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.490
Select this circle.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:36.490
We can at line that,

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.200
plus icon to the sensor off the serial.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.600
And here we go.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.680
We have these elements and I'm going Teoh.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:55.110
Position them in a group and I rename it to team.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:09.150
Then select rectangle tool and set a color for the previous rectangle.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.050
Because I would like to change it on.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.950
I make a new decision for this part.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:23.550
I do the same for the title to set a new collar for that.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:36.940
Go to phone our some that calm and such for and angle icon.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:43.830
As you can see here we have some icons.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.550
Select and Gil,

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.050
right?

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.950
Copy the belief icon,

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.750
go to text tool,

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.950
set the front too,

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:56.750
phoned,

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.450
awesome free solid,

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.250
then paste.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:15.450
The icon resize it and increased the phone size reposition it and drag it to the right.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:20.380
Then you can use a line.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:27.250
Vertical centers duplicate the goal if icon select,

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:33.450
sleep horizontal from transform options.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.350
Then I need Teoh.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.350
Drag it to the left side.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:48.790
So I select a rectangle and I go to the belief icon and from the Options bar,

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.450
align it to the left.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.900
Here,

00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:01.050
I want to get help from smart guys off further shop.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:15.350
Hold control key to see the exact distance between each elements so you can't see numbers

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:17.350
are appearing.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:22.650
Do it again for the right side.
