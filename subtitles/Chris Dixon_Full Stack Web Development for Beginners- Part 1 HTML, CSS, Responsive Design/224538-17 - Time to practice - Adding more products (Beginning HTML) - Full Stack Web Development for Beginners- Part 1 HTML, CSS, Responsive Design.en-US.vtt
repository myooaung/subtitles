00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.635
We've now covered a lot of the basics of HTML,

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:07.635
I would like you to now go ahead and get some practice

00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:10.920
on your own by adding some more products.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.940
Of course, extra products will look exactly like this one we have

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.095
here without any of the CSS styling just yet,

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:21.120
but the important thing,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.595
is to get the content on the screen.

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:26.895
If we go over to the finished version here,

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:29.475
you can see six different products.

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.175
This is what I would like you to go ahead and do.

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:34.680
You can add even more if you want to.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.315
It doesn't have to be six,

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:40.650
but I've provided six images in total which you can use.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.300
We already have this first item of the game controller,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.140
so you can base the rest of this one and just change the image

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.880
and also the text of the heading and also the description.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.020
Make sure each product also has a surrounding GIF too,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.225
just like the one we already have.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:03.605
You could, of course, copy and paste in this existing one we already have.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:07.915
You could copy the full div section and paste in another five times.

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:10.385
But if you are new to HTML,

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:13.625
I would recommend you at least try to type out some,

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:16.090
to give you a little more practice.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.130
I would suggest you pause the video on

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.790
the finished version to see all the images and text.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.815
Don't worry about messing things up.

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:28.410
I will be going over this in the next video.
