00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
In the last video, we added some basic form elements to the page.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.695
Also, we added the text of Name,

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:12.255
Email, and Message to the left of each input.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:15.945
Tell the user what information to enter.

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:19.905
This is just plain text with no other HTML elements,

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:23.400
such as a p-tag, which you can see here.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.685
There is also no way for the browser to know these texts is related to these inputs.

00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:33.015
We can fix this by adding a label.

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:39.355
A label it's just a way of adding a caption of texts to each input like this.

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:43.160
Let's first cut this text out,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.845
and then we can add our label inside here.

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:52.355
Between open and closed and times we can now paste our text back in,

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:56.155
give that save and reload the browser.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:01:00.770
We can see instantly that if we look at this first input,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.280
it looks pretty much the same as before.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.675
However, the browser now knows this is a caption for a form elements.

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:11.600
But how does it know this label is for

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.060
this particular inputs and not the Email or Message?

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.475
Well, we can link them by adding a id attributes.

00:01:20.475 --> 00:01:24.980
This first inputs, just off the placeholder,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.305
we can add an id attributes and this can be a name of our choice.

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:33.760
I want to name this Name, to keep it simple.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.800
Then over in the label,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.325
inside the opening tag,

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:43.405
we can add the four attributes and link it to the id with the same name.

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:47.750
This id attribute is not just for use with a label,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.915
it's important for targeting these individual elements with both JavaScript and CSS, too.

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:56.900
Let's now do the same for Email.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.480
Just after the placeholder,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.400
the ID of Email,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.280
I'm going out on a label.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.840
Cut the text out,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.090
and then paste it back in.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.860
Then we can add the for attribute inside here of email.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.230
Then lastly, we can add this to the text area too.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.095
Just after rows, add the id and again it could be name of your choice,

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:30.580
but I'm going to call mine Message.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.460
Cut the text out and then add as the label.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.890
Finally, the for attribute,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.300
and this is Message Two, and save that.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.185
It's important not to have the same id name more than once on a web documents.

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:57.000
We have cluster this purpose and we'll cover this in more details soon, so make sure,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.190
it's saved and then over to the browser, reload and,

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.770
of course we see no difference but these all now

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.205
linked too behind the scenes for the web browser.

00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:13.485
One other advantage of using a label is that the label is also clickable.

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:18.675
Rather than before when we could only click on this input to make active,

00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:22.530
if we click off, we can also click on the name too.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.185
This also makes input active,

00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:27.525
so the user can begin to type.

00:03:27.525 --> 00:03:32.035
Another attribute you will commonly see is a name attributes.

00:03:32.035 --> 00:03:38.715
Let's go over to our text editor and inside this first inputs,

00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:43.290
we can add a name and let's call this Name.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.300
Same for the email,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:57.510
name = email and also the text area of message.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.235
We can be confused first,

00:04:00.235 --> 00:04:06.665
why we have this name and also the id attributes and this is understandable.

00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:09.920
I won't go into too much detail just yet,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.970
as a lot of this may not become clear until we get more familiar

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.535
with java scripts and also processing forms on the server.

00:04:18.535 --> 00:04:21.530
The id attribute which we added first,

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.244
is usually used to reference the elements,

00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:26.165
in our case the inputs.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:30.340
It's a way to grab the element with JavaScript or CSS.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.795
The Name attribute, however,

00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:37.150
is more useful when submitted form to Web Server.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.940
This name is used to reference the data which the user has

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.185
entered inside the input fields just here.

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:48.740
It's a way to grab this data out of there.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.215
If this does not make sense just yet,

00:04:51.215 --> 00:04:55.295
don't worry, we'll see a lot more as we go through this course.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:05:00.960
For now though, we'll continue to look at more input types in the next video.
