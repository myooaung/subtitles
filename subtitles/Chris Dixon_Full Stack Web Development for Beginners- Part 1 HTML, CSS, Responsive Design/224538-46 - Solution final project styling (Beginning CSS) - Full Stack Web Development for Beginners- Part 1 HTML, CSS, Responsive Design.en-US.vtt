00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
I hope you all managed to complete the final project, styling challenge.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.745
Remember though there is no right or wrong way to do this.

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:12.675
Boots are now going to run through the final styles for my version,

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:17.415
starting with adding some more height to the "Header" and the "Footer."

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:21.060
So let's go to the styles.css,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.895
and if we go up towards the top,

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:27.630
we're already targeting the "Header" and "Footer" area.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.245
So all we need to do is to add small padding,

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:33.885
to pad out the inside of the dibs.

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:36.900
So 20 pixels on the top and bottom,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.320
and 10 pixels on the left and right

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.970
"Refresh" and now we have small padding

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.175
inside the "Header" and the "Footer" area at the bottom.

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:51.305
Then we can make this site title at the top,

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:54.050
take up 70 percent of the weight for the header,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.490
which will then push over the links on the search box to the right hand side.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.780
So let's go down to the header h1,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.490
so go to the header li,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.530
the header h1 here.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.060
Then let's go for the header h1 title,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.850
and then set the width to be 70 percent.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.145
Let's see how this is looking.

00:01:23.145 --> 00:01:27.170
Great, so this causes the links and the search box to move to the right.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.655
If you open up the developer tools and then highlight the section,

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:34.285
we can see the effect of what we've just done.

00:01:34.285 --> 00:01:37.175
This now takes up 70 percent to the header,

00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:40.210
pushing everything else over to the right.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.550
So this technique works with these projects,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.505
but later we will look at more elegant solutions,

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:49.490
when we begin looking at the flexbox and the grid.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.490
These kind of solutions will allow this layout

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.570
to also work on different screen sizes too.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.975
Next, if we move on to setting the product text to be aligned in the center of the div.

00:02:01.975 --> 00:02:05.385
We already have a product div here.

00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:15.035
So let's add one more CSS property of text-align center. There we go.

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:18.245
Now onto styling for the table,

00:02:18.245 --> 00:02:22.350
we can also target the table with the table elements,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.655
just like we're doing with previous elements.

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:29.680
So let's go ahead and add a comment,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.510
so add "Table" inside of there.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.975
So let's start by selecting the "Table elements" and make it a little bit wider.

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:45.320
So I'm going to go for 400 pixels,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.980
set the text line to be on the left of each cell.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.090
Then also add some margin to the top and bottom.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.730
So 20 pixels on the top and bottom and zero on the left and right.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.525
Let's see how this is looking,

00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:06.450
select the "Game controller."

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.935
So now we've got some margin on the top and bottom.

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:13.105
If we select the developer "Tools",

00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:15.995
then highlight our table cells,

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.810
we can see by this blue section,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.940
all the text is aligned to the left.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.990
Let's close it down and then we can move on to this caption area at the top.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.900
Just to give it a little bit more styling and also

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.345
some padding on the bottom to keep it away from the table.

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:38.100
So we have the caption selector.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.830
So let's start by setting the font weight to be bold.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.950
We can set this to be italic with the font style.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.224
So let's set that to be italic,

00:03:52.224 --> 00:03:54.845
then we can add a border.

00:03:54.845 --> 00:03:58.624
So previously we've used borders around our products,

00:03:58.624 --> 00:04:02.245
and these by default apply to all four sides.

00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:04.800
We can add individual sides,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.435
so if we wanted a line just below this text here,

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:10.715
we could add a border bottom.

00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:12.395
So instead of border,

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:15.060
we can add border bottom.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.100
So a borderline of one pixel and solid.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.140
In fact, will make this dotted for this example,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:36.975
and then some padding of 10 pixels to give some spacing of the browser, "Refresh."

00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:38.645
There is our dotted line,

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:43.460
and now the small spacing by adding 10 pixels of padding.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.235
So we're nearly there now with the table,

00:04:46.235 --> 00:04:51.095
all we want to do is to also add some padding to these cell values.

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:53.675
Remember we've got the table heading,

00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:55.610
which is the th tags,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.715
and then the data has the td tags.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:02.870
So we can go ahead and select both these in the CSS.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:11.310
We have th, td and then padding 10 pixels,

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.205
"Refresh" and just to finish this table off,

00:05:16.205 --> 00:05:20.045
I'm going to also add a hover state with a pseudo-class.

00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:22.760
So each time we hover over one of these rows,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.325
the background color will be highlighted.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:32.330
So let's select the "Table row" and then add the hover pseudo-class.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.790
So each time a hover over row,

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:43.110
we can change the background color to be a x value of F5-F5-F5.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.880
"Reload" and it is so background color.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.220
So if we zoom in, we'll be able to see this slightly better.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.455
This is it now for all the styles which are added to this project.

00:05:57.455 --> 00:05:59.240
I hope you managed to add some of them

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.720
yourself and make yours look even better than mine does.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.185
Next, we're going to go on to the final video in this section,

00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:09.960
were will look at the cascade and inheritance.
