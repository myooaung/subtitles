00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
Welcome to Full Stack Web Development for beginners.

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:07.650
This course, the designs take you from a beginner to

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.945
a web developer capable of building the only front end user interfaces,

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:17.265
but also how to design and build the backend to interact with too.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:22.275
So whom I? My name is Chris and I will be your instructor throughout this course.

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:26.850
I'm a web developer and also the producer of lots of tutorials

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.700
teaching thousands of students the skills they need to build websites and applications.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.700
This is the first part in the full series,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.485
where we'll start at the beginning teaching you how HTML, CSS,

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:43.190
and responsive web design to give you

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.594
the skills you need to build great looking functional websites,

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:49.565
which look great on any side device.

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:53.710
This course contains over five hours of high-quality training.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.044
We first begin with HTML,

00:00:56.044 --> 00:01:00.710
covering everything you need to know from setting up and structured on webpages,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.550
elements, and attributes, hiding forms and inputs,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.780
linking of webpages, images, and so much more.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.190
This is all learned in a hands on project-based approach,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.070
where you build this website completely from

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.540
scratch while applying all the techniques which you learn.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.120
We then style this using CSS,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.255
and we'll cover everything you need to know such as selectors, fonts, margin,

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.460
padding, the box model,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.070
floats positioning along with lots,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.590
lots more, includes some handy CSS tips and tricks along the way.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.550
We then round this off by making the site fully responsive

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.670
to make it change layouts and respond to all size devices.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.715
You'll learn all about scalable units, fluid layout,

00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:55.729
media queries, responsive images,

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.820
all while applying this to a project.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.805
I hope you're excited and let's begin learning

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:07.110
all the fundamentals of web development in the first part of this course.
