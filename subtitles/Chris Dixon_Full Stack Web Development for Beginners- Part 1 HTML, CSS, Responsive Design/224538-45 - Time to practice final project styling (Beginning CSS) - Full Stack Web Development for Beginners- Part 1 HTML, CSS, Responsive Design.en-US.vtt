00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.260
We've come a long way in the section and by now,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.990
hopefully you feeling a lot more confidence when using CSS.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.365
I would now like you to go ahead and add

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:14.445
some final styles and finishing touches to this project.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:17.940
In particular, I would like you to add some more height

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.110
to this header and also the footer area at the bottom.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.340
Also, if we align the header links, these ones here,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.835
and also the search box over to the right-hand side,

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.745
just like if you visit the finished version here.

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:36.030
Push everything over to the right-hand side.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.695
Also, if we set the text alignments on the products to the center,

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:41.910
just like you see here.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.275
[inaudible] are left aligned.

00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:49.535
Finally, over in the product detail page,

00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:51.380
you would click on this "Game Controller."

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.210
A little bit of styling too for this table at the bottom.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.945
We've not covered Styling Tables yet,

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:01.010
but you can use all the same techniques you already know,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.115
such as adding margins and padding to the individual table elements.

00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:09.050
This is what I would like you to go ahead and do.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.275
Remember, there is no right or wrong way.

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:14.000
Both I will be run through this in

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.660
the next video to show you how I came to this finished version.
