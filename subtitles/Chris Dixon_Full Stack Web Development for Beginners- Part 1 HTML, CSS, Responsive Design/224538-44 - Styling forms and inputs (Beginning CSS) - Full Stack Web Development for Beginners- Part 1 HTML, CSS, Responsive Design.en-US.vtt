00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900
I want to now move on to the Contact Us page to add some specific styling to this form.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.930
This is our current version here but if we go

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.930
over to the Contact Us page on the finished version,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.495
we can see it looks a little bit different,

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:19.770
but it manages the case of adding some spacing and alignment.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.920
You can, of course, go ahead and do this yourself if you

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.785
feel confident doing so but if not,

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:27.615
just follow along with me.

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:34.830
Let's begin by going over to the style.css and now we can go ahead and make a comment.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:43.660
Inside here we can add the Contact Us and now we can go ahead and target our form.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.045
We can add some basic styles such as padding.

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.550
So a padding ten pixels,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.915
which will of course appear inside of the form element.

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:56.870
Then to add some spacing on the top and bottom of the form.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.120
We can add some margin.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.475
Ten pixels on the top and bottom,

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:03.955
and zero on the left and right.

00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:06.900
We can also make this a little bit wider,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.735
so let's say 600 pixels.

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:14.490
Give that a save and then refresh.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.235
Now we have some basic styling for our form.

00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:24.950
Things would also look a lot better if these first four inputs were also lined up.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.355
At the moment the four input areas are all

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:32.140
pushed up to the edge of the text on the label in fact.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.610
To do this, I'm going to add a custom class,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.655
these first four div sections.

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:42.260
Over to the Contact Us or contact.html.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.895
Let's take a look at the first four divs which begin with name.

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:52.110
Let's add a class of inline.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.724
Then let's copy this and paste it for the email,

00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:06.140
also for the message and then we also have the subject,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.065
which is this section here,

00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:12.550
so to the opening div for the section two,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.360
make sure we save that and then we can target this over in the CSS,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.680
starting with setting the width of the text label,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.985
so.inline for the class,

00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:25.740
and then select the label.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.740
The width can be any value of our choosing but I'm going to go

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.805
for 100 pixels. Give that a save.

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:38.060
First of all, if we refresh,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.100
we can see there's no change.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.175
This is because as we've already mentioned,

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:49.370
we can set the width for inline elements and by default, Label is inline.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.790
So I'm going to go over to the CSS and changes to

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.120
be inline block so it can affect the width.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.510
Good. This is more like it.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.345
We now have a wider label which lines up these inputs on the right.

00:03:07.345 --> 00:03:11.910
But these inputs would also look better with being a little bit wider.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.050
We can tag certain inputs based on our input type.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.385
First of all, if we set the inputs and then open up the square brackets,

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:29.700
we can then tag only the type of text and then separated by comma,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.590
we can also tag the inputs with the type of email too,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.775
and we'll open up the braces as we normally do.

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:41.600
For these first two,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.260
let's add the padding of 10 pixels,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.420
and then we can make them a little bit wider,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.295
so let's go for 400 pixels, over to the browser.

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:56.810
Good. This looks a little bit better but we can see

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.590
this text area is still smaller than the other inputs.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.885
We have a couple of options here.

00:04:02.885 --> 00:04:07.340
We could either go back to the HTML code and add more columns,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.490
since we have the columns and rows attributes on

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.940
the text area or we can override these in CSS by also targeting the text area.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.635
Now if we reload all inputs are now the same width.

00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:28.910
Just to wrap this up, let's add some margin also around each

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.005
one of these div elements just to add some spacing to the top and bottom.

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:40.095
We can do this by selecting the Form and then each div which follows.

00:04:40.095 --> 00:04:44.840
Let's set the margin to be 10 pixels on the top and bottom,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.080
and zero on the left and right.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.715
Remember this will tie up all the div elements which are a direct child of Form.

00:04:52.715 --> 00:04:59.700
So reload and now have some spacing on the top and bottom of each div section.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.675
Good. This form now looks a lot better with some more even spacing.

00:05:04.675 --> 00:05:11.010
Next is your chance to get some more practice by adding the final styles to this project.
