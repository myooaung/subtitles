00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.550
In this video, we're going to look at an important part of websites which is forms.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.210
You've probably all used something like this, which you see here.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.155
If you go to the finished version and click on the contact us page.

00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:18.115
This is a form which is used to get the input from a user,

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:23.410
such as gathering information to register or to send a message.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.040
The data entered is usually sent to a web server

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.355
and we'll look at this side of things later on in the course.

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:35.545
For now though, we're just focusing on this HTML side,

00:00:35.545 --> 00:00:38.960
which is used to display the form on the screen.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.335
Let's get to work on the contact us page so we can begin to add our form.

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:50.120
We already added a contact dot HTML file just here.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.200
We can begin to add our form to this.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.905
We can begin by adding our structure.

00:00:55.905 --> 00:01:02.015
I'm going to begin by copying the content from the product detail to a HTML.

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:07.945
Copy and then paste this in place of the text which we'll add it here.

00:01:07.945 --> 00:01:11.730
You can of course type this out for more practice if you prefer.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.775
But I'm just going to paste this in to get things moving onto forms.

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.700
To keep our website consistent,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.185
we can reuse the same header and sidebar.

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:23.330
This header can stay,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.040
and all the side section can stay too,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.420
but I'm going to remove most of the main section apart from this heading.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.305
Let's go all the way down to the bottom of the table.

00:01:38.305 --> 00:01:41.265
Instead of product detail for the level two heading,

00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:45.040
I'm going to add a title of contact us.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.635
Now, we have this main section clear to add a form.

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:53.670
Let's give that a go and save that.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.710
If we go back over to the browser inside of our projects,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.190
let's try clicking on contact us.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.270
Now, we're in this contacts dot HTML.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.070
We still have the heading and also the sidebar,

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.605
but no other main content.

00:02:09.605 --> 00:02:13.060
Within this main section we can add our form.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.910
The form is contained inside of a form element.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.840
Let's add this in there.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.530
You will often see some attributes inside of this form opening tag, such as action.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.760
Just like that, and also method.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.570
We'll come back to these later in the course as they're

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.750
related to how we send our form data to the server.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.585
But I just wanted you to be aware of them if you come across them in any documentation.

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:51.965
Action is used to set the location where the form is to be sent to.

00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:54.965
We add a file path inside there,

00:02:54.965 --> 00:03:00.955
and method defines which HTTP method we want to use to send a form.

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:05.015
We can either send as a get or a post request,

00:03:05.015 --> 00:03:07.740
but more on this later.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.540
For now, I want to concentrate on getting some inputs on the screen.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.105
Inputs are the sound capture user inputs,

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:19.805
such as text, which is entered,

00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:22.885
or a checkbox when the user clicks on it.

00:03:22.885 --> 00:03:26.705
Let's start with a text input for the user's name.

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:30.030
We can add a input element.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.025
Just like that, there are lots of different types of

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:38.400
inputs and we set them using the type attributes.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:47.115
Let's add the first one of text and let's go over to our projects and then refresh.

00:03:47.115 --> 00:03:52.435
There is our contact us text at the bottom and a text input.

00:03:52.435 --> 00:03:57.830
This is just a simple box where you can enter any type of text we want to.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.680
In fact, we're not restricted to just text,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.685
we can even type in numbers and different characters too.

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:07.820
We can add some text before or after it too,

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.000
to let the user know what to enter,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.710
such as their name.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.060
Let's do this now.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.500
Just before I'm going to add the text of name,

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.564
then reload and there's our text on the screen as expected.

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:29.165
If we take a look though at this finished version,

00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:35.060
we can see inside the text input we have some faint text instructions.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.470
This is removed when the user clicks on the text box and we start to type.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.495
This text is added with the placeholder attributes.

00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:46.580
Let's go back over to our inputs.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.355
Just after the type attributes,

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:54.950
we can add a placeholder and then we can add our text into there of,

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.585
enter your name and that's our text inside of there.

00:05:01.585 --> 00:05:07.085
Next we want the user to enter their e-mail address, which is just here.

00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:09.080
We deal with this in the same way,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.875
but this time the input has a type of e-mail.

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:16.440
Under a new line, we can add e-mail,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.240
and then add our inputs.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.650
This time with a type of e-mail.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.230
This can also take the placeholder attribute too of enter your e-mail.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:41.200
Give that a save, and then refresh and there's our to form elements side-by-side.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.735
The next input type is the text area.

00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:51.610
This is used when we want a larger box to type in more text for areas such as a message.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.240
Let's add this on a new line.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.080
First of all, the texts of message,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.240
and then this time instead of the inputs,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.310
we use text area.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.260
This has opening and closing tags, unlike these inputs.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.140
Inside here we can also add some extra attributes for this one too.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.085
We can set the initial number of columns wide we want the box to be.

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:21.130
Let's add the calls attributes and I'm going to set mine to be 30.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.930
Also the number of rows too for the height.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.150
I'm going to set my initial value to be five.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.980
Text areas can often be dragged larger and

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.465
smaller with a little drag section in the corner.

00:06:34.465 --> 00:06:38.645
Refresh the browser and there's our larger text area,

00:06:38.645 --> 00:06:41.690
which we can add multiple lines of text in.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.810
As I mentioned before, we can also click on the section in

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.480
the corner and make it larger or smaller.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.490
Remember earlier in the course we mentioned we can

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.735
categorize most elements into inline or block level.

00:06:56.735 --> 00:07:01.025
We can clearly see that here that the form elements are in line.

00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:03.455
If you want them to go on their own line,

00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:05.225
stacked on top of each other,

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:07.595
we can surround them in a div,

00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:10.790
which is a block level elements and this

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.935
gives us the effect that we see on the final version here.

00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:18.980
Inside the form, let's add some div elements.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:24.870
That's got the name, I'll paste that in.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:33.150
Second div for the e-mail and

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:40.810
finally a third one for the message, paste that in.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.680
Then reload and now,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.800
all three inputs on their own separate line.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.780
This is a good start to our form and will continue in the next video.
