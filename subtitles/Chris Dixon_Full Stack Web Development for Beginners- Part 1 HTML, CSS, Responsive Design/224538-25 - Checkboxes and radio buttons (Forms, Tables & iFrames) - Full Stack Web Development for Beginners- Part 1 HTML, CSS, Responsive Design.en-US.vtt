00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
Another common input type which you probably already use before is a checkbox.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.955
Checkbox, just like we have here,

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:12.705
allows the User to check more than one box a time.

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:16.770
Here we allow a user to subscribe to offers by newsletter,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.710
e-mail, or post, so let's see how we can do this over in a text editor.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.980
Just like before, I'm going to add a surrounding

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.395
a div tag and make sure this is still within this form elements here.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:36.030
Open up the div tags to make this block level.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.300
Then we're can add some p tags for the text at the top and

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.250
the text is going to be just what we say here of subscribe to future offers buy.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.935
Then a colon at the end.

00:00:55.935 --> 00:00:59.250
We can also use a label for this checkbox,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.035
so add these first.

00:01:01.035 --> 00:01:07.340
Just below the p, let's add our label and just like before,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.275
we add the four attributes.

00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:12.184
I'm going to call this the newsletter,

00:01:12.184 --> 00:01:15.160
which we can link to the ID soon.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.200
Then add newsletter inside the opening and closing tag.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.590
Just after this, we can add our input, like we've seen earlier.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.380
This input has the type of checkbox.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.260
Then we give it the ID to link to this newsletter just here.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.680
Give that save and test inside the browser by

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.330
going over to our contact page, and then refresh.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.640
There's our text between the,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.485
p tags just at the top there.

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:54.165
Then have the label of newsletter,

00:01:54.165 --> 00:01:59.125
and you can also see we can click on this checkbox and also unclick.

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.475
We now have a checkbox which you can click on and off.

00:02:02.475 --> 00:02:07.175
Now we can add this in two more times for the e-mail and post options.

00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:09.560
Let's do exactly the same.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.360
First, we can add a label and the label for,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.710
let's call this to e-mail.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:28.960
The name of e-mail and the input with a type again of checkbox,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.945
the ID of e-mail and it closes off.

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:39.780
Then our third and final one,

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.690
this is going to be label for post.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:54.510
Goes off with the text label of post two and the final checkbox input.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:03.550
Type of checkbox and an ID of post then I close off.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.475
Go to the browser and as our newsletter, e-mail and post.

00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:16.505
There are also some more attributes we should add too.

00:03:16.505 --> 00:03:23.465
At the moment, these free checkboxes are next to each other on the page, both unrelated.

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.930
We can effectively link if we wanted to,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.380
by giving them all the same name attributes.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.785
This is a name attribute which we looked at in the last video,

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:36.330
which were added just here.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.370
Let's do the same for our input with a type of checkbox.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.840
The name, I'm going to call this subscribe.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.510
I'm just going to copy this and add the same two more times.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.430
This name attributes, as mentioned in the last video,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.115
means when we submit this form to the server,

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:04.990
these values from the input will also be passed too.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.540
With checkboxes we can't type in a value like we could with the text or e-mail input,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.140
so we can add a value attributes in just like this.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.110
The value, and this can be the newsletter.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.160
This is a data which is passed to the server once it sends,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.850
so the value for the second one,

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.400
of e-mail and also the value of post.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.185
Each time the form is submitted,

00:04:39.185 --> 00:04:41.705
the server will get the value of newsletter,

00:04:41.705 --> 00:04:45.905
e-mail, or post, whichever one is clicked on.

00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:48.455
One of the key things to know is here,

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:51.180
is you can check as many as you want.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.340
We can click on and off of any of these.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.330
This is a key difference between checkboxes and radio buttons,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.430
which we're going to look at next.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.800
If we go all to the finished version,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.220
we've already done these free checkboxes we see here.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.960
But just below this we have,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.740
"How would you like us to respond?"

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.905
You can see these radio buttons,

00:05:11.905 --> 00:05:14.350
but we can only click on one at

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.930
a time and that's the key difference between radio and checkboxes.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.350
Radio inputs are added in a similar way to these checkboxes.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.995
I'm going to add a surrounding div.

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:31.520
Again, make sure this is still within the form.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.590
Then inside here, the p times at

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.890
the top for the text of how would you like us to respond,

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.740
with a question mark at the very end.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.860
Then we can go ahead and add our labels.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.545
This also has the four attributes, so we can link it.

00:06:01.545 --> 00:06:04.930
I want to call this one the phone response,

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.480
close that off and add the label of phone.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.180
Then we go ahead and add our inputs.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:23.460
This time with the type of radio and also the ID of phone response, to match this.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.540
Add that in too and I close this off.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.005
Then we just need one more for the e-mail.

00:06:31.005 --> 00:06:36.810
First of all, the label and this time it can be e-mail response.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.800
This is keep it consistent with the phone response above.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.390
Close that off and ask the label of e-mail,

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:58.540
then inputs, type of radio and these ID of e-mail response.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.910
Close that off, good.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:10.570
I've used phone response and e-mail response here rather than phone or e-mail,

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.810
because we already have e-mail ID on his page,

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.550
which we'll use just above.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:21.550
I remember we said before the IDs should be unique and only used once on the page,

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.030
so let's give that save and test inside the browser,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.210
back over to our current project and reload.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.225
As are two radio buttons at the top.

00:07:31.225 --> 00:07:34.555
But one thing you notice is if we click on these,

00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:39.125
we can see that both of them can't be checked at the same time,

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.460
so this is different behavior to what we expected,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.995
from what we've seen before on the finished version.

00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:50.690
We seem to be able to select both of the radio buttons at the same time.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.645
This is because just like checkboxes,

00:07:53.645 --> 00:07:58.030
we need to also group these together with a name attribute,

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.920
so let's add the name in each input,

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:10.830
so let's call this response and the second input name equals response.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.035
Now is linked together.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:18.575
Let's test this by refreshing and try both of these.

00:08:18.575 --> 00:08:24.630
Now we can only select one value at a time because here is a group together.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:31.170
Finally, we can add a value attributes to also send to the server too.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.460
The value this time can be phone,

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.595
and the value for the second one is going to be e-mail.

00:08:40.595 --> 00:08:45.140
You may also see checkboxes with a value of true and false too.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.340
If there are only two options such as a subscribe input,

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.535
which is a simple yes or no.

00:08:51.535 --> 00:08:55.945
Then a true or false may be a good use case for this.

00:08:55.945 --> 00:09:01.950
Next, we're going to move on to another important type of input, which is select.
