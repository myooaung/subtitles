00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
I just want to take a quick moment,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.205
take a look at using HTML comments.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:10.755
This is only going to be a short video for comments and really important to know and use.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:13.830
A comment is basically an area where we can

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.415
type in some comments or notes to both ourselves,

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:20.695
or other developers you may read on code.

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:24.030
This becomes more important in larger projects.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.720
We can better understand what is going on inside of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.435
our code or to jog our memory if we return a few months or even years later.

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:40.225
To other comments, we need to include the following syntax into our HTML file.

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:43.140
Let's say above this main section,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.530
we open up the angle brackets,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.645
just like a HTML elements,

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:50.360
then add an exclamation mark and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.060
then two dashes and you can

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.630
see already that all this section afterwards is changed color.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.610
Then we close this off by adding two more dashes and close off the brackets.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.730
Inside here we can add our text to make a comment,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.220
let's say main section to display products.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.700
Then we can save that. Now if we refresh the browser,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.105
and if we go to the main section,

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:23.195
which is this "All Items" section here,

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:26.360
we see that the text is not rendered to the screen,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.460
like the rest of the HTML.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.470
Also comments can be over multiple lines to.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.255
So instead of having this all on one line,

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:37.745
we can do something such as;

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:39.920
let's go to the very top here,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.245
or let's start with the body.

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:47.505
We can open up our comments and close this off just the same.

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:50.795
We can maybe do a temporary to do list.

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:53.255
Lets say number one,

00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:58.355
create the shop.HTML page.

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:03.070
Number two, add CSS styling.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.675
We can go on over multiple lines.

00:02:06.675 --> 00:02:09.575
Again, by saving and refreshing,

00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:13.530
we can see that this comments aren't at the top of the page.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.250
Comments are also useful for removing lines of code 2.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.555
For example, if you wanted to change a product image,

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:26.980
so if we go down to the first product,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.120
which is this game controller here,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.920
we could just add a comments like this,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.490
just before the image elements.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.910
The same as before. Open up the bracket,

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.845
add exclamation and two dashes and you can instantly see we don't close this off,

00:02:44.845 --> 00:02:48.895
that all the remaining code afterwards is commented out.

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:51.970
So just give a save and refresh,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.400
and then we can see anything after the image has been removed from our website.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.925
But we just want to comment out this image.

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:05.180
Let's close this off just after the image elements.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.475
Save and then go down.

00:03:08.475 --> 00:03:10.980
So all of our content is added packing,

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.135
except this image for the game controller.

00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:19.190
I'm just going to undo these changes and adds the image back in.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.575
We save and refresh and there is our image back in place.

00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:30.095
This syntax we use here of the angle brackets, the exclamation mark,

00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:33.650
and also the two dashes is only used when comment in

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.720
our HTML code or when using HTML files.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.550
Over languages, use a different syntax,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.010
but it work in exactly the same way.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.400
We will look at how comments work for over languages later.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.570
But for now, let's move on to look at HTML entities and symbols.
