00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.735
Classes and IDs is something which will use all the time when building websites.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:10.620
They are way to select or to hook a certain elements

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.310
on our page so we can apply our CSS to it.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.265
We will also use them later in the course to,

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:19.259
when working with JavaScript,

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.110
let's first begin with ID.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.980
We can add an ID attribute to any element then target is element using CSS.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.475
If we go over to the contact.html page,

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:35.475
we've already used IDs in this section,

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:40.305
so taking a look for the name at the top and if you scroll across to the right,

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:43.290
over here we have an ID name.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.575
We also had an ID of e-mail and message too.

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:53.120
One important thing to note with IDs is that they must be unique.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.485
We should only use one ID name on each page.

00:00:57.485 --> 00:01:02.590
We then make this ID up in the CSS file with a hash prefix,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.250
to add some styling to this name will go over to the style.css,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.005
and then down here,

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:10.444
using a hash prefix,

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:12.840
we could target the name.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.190
Then we could do things such as adding a background color.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.955
Let's change the background to be red,

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:23.025
and then give us save.

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:25.600
Over to our web browser,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.310
and we need to go to the contact us page.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.575
Scrolling down and now we have a red background for this name section.

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:38.075
It's important to know the IDs must not start with a number two.

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:43.700
If we were to go over to the CSS and then add a number such as this,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.500
the text editor turns it to red to signal a problem.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.905
Let's us move down save.

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:55.385
This is an ID which we use to select a single element on a page,

00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:59.810
but what if we wanted the same styles to apply to multiple areas,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.900
such as our products.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.605
For this case, we can use a class,

00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:08.015
adding the same class name to all of our productive tags

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:12.155
will allow us to write some styles which will apply to all of them.

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:15.185
If we go to the index.html,

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:18.625
and then it will locate our first product,

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:21.210
which is the controller.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.995
For the surrounding div, which is here just above the link,

00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:28.830
we can add a class attribute of product.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.440
Since we can use this more than once,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.630
let's copy this and add it to all six products.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.480
The second one, the third one,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.920
the fourth one and if you've got more than six add them at each and every one,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.740
and that's all six, so gives us save.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.925
We also have a product inside of the product detail page two.

00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:02.560
We can add this to our product inside of there.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.870
Scroll down to the main section,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.345
and again inside the opening div for the product.

00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:11.090
This will make sure that the same styles we apply in

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.410
the CSS will apply to this product too.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.009
This time instead of the hash prefix and if we go to the CSS,

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:23.120
we use a dot to indicate that we're targeting a class.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.430
Will then enter the name of products,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.705
and now we can add some styles inside these curly braces.

00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:36.400
This class, along with the ID which we used before and also

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.060
these element names just above are all called selectors.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.090
They also small advanced likes these two,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.985
and we'll take a look at these later in the course.

00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:52.405
Let's go ahead and add a border to our productive of one pixel wide,

00:03:52.405 --> 00:03:56.630
a solid line, and the color of gray.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.765
Then we can set the width of each products to be 200 pixels wide,

00:04:01.765 --> 00:04:07.570
the semicolon and let's see how this is looking over in the index page.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.855
Gives our reload and go down to office products,

00:04:12.855 --> 00:04:19.225
we can see the border if we look down here and also this looks about 200 pixels wide.

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:23.990
However, this image above is too big to fit inside this container.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.660
The other few ways which you can do this,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.930
we could set the overflow property to be hidden,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.320
just like that and save that and then reload.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.650
Now we can see the image is inside of the 200 pixels container.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.395
This is not ideal because this hides the rest of the image,

00:04:45.395 --> 00:04:47.360
which doesn't look too great.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.700
A better solution for this will be to set

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.225
the maximum width property rather than the overflow,

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:55.545
let us remove this overflow,

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:59.705
and then below this we can target the image selector.

00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:03.765
Then use the max-width CSS property,

00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:06.570
answer this would be a 100 percent,

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.830
give that save and then reload.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.830
This makes sure the image stretches no further than the surrounding container.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.385
That looks a lot better. This is more like what we want.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:22.670
However, the product is still stacked on top of each other,

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.160
because we mentioned earlier,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.960
div elements of block level and begin on a new line.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.830
But, this is okay for now and next we'll move on to margin and padding.
