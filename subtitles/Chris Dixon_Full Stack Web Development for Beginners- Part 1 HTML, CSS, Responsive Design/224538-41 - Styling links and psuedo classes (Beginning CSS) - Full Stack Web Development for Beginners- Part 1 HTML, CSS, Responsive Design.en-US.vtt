00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
As we can already see in our project,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.595
by default, links don't look very good.

00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:07.740
They have an underline section,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.490
which you can see just here and also in the header section,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.575
you may need to zoom-in though.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.680
Underline is something which we want to remove.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.455
Also by default, the colors are not very attractive.

00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:23.895
Let's start by removing its underline from the links.

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:27.315
We can do this if we go over to our CSS.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.820
Then just under the list items,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.965
let's add the A tag.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:38.650
To remove this, we can set the text decoration to be a value of non.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.370
Then up to the browser,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.210
this should now remove the default links from

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.535
the header section and also from the titles too.

00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:51.145
This takes care of the underline,

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:55.285
but we still need to change the text color of the links too,

00:00:55.285 --> 00:01:01.145
both of these product and also the header and footer section down at the bottom.

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:04.580
We could do this by adding individual classes to

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.235
each item and certainly individual CSS color properties.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.695
Or we can go ahead and do something a little simpler.

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:17.690
First, I'm going to go over to the proto section and set the default text color

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.955
with color property by setting an RGB value of 49 for the red,

00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:30.210
the green 46, and 46 for the blue too.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.520
Give a save and if we go to the browser and refresh,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.185
we now see a slightly lighter gray color. Back to the links.

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:42.580
If we go over to the A section,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.390
rather than setting a value such as an RGB or hex color,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.575
I'm going to go ahead and set the color to be inherit and give us save.

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:55.925
The inherit keyword specifies

00:01:55.925 --> 00:02:00.535
a property should inherit its value from the parent element.

00:02:00.535 --> 00:02:04.310
The product links will inherit this color for

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.700
the body section and also the header and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.965
footer links will inherit the color value from the section here.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:15.850
Let's see how this looks over in the browser.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.860
Good. Now we have the header links, the white color.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.290
We can see the products have this darker gray color which matches

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.040
the body and then down at the bottom we have the white links for the footer area too.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.265
We can see exactly what is going on if we go inside the div tools.

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:36.425
Right-click and inspect.

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:39.690
First let's select one of our products.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.450
Over on the right-hand side,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.275
and we start to scroll down.

00:02:44.275 --> 00:02:47.660
We can see we've inherited from his body section,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.975
and we inherited the font family and also this gray color which we added in.

00:02:52.975 --> 00:02:57.630
Click on the selected ones more and I go up to the header links.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.260
Here we can see we've inherited from the header this color of white.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.465
We can turn this on and off and see the effect that this has.

00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:12.630
Close down the div tools and now with these links taken care of,

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.220
I want to now move on to what is called pseudo-classes.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.080
Pseudo-classes are like an extension to a CSS selector.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.895
For example, we can still select links with this A selector,

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:27.905
which we've already have done here.

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:33.590
Well, for example, only when a mouse hovers over them or if they've already been visited.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.100
Or we could select a list item with li,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.260
just like we've done here.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.670
But only select the third item in a list.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.614
There are quite a lot pseudo-classes available,

00:03:45.614 --> 00:03:49.975
but let's take a look at some of the most common, starting with hover.

00:03:49.975 --> 00:03:53.325
If we go down to our A element for our links

00:03:53.325 --> 00:03:56.790
and just below is a section we can add a new A element.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.695
Separated by a colon we can add the name of our pseudo-class.

00:04:00.695 --> 00:04:03.085
For this case I'm going to use hover.

00:04:03.085 --> 00:04:07.875
This will select all the A elements when the mouse hovers over them.

00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:17.805
We could do some things such as setting a color and add hex value of 0e69e9.

00:04:17.805 --> 00:04:21.120
Of course this can be any color you are choosing.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.270
Let's test this in the browser.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.525
Now for reloads and hover over any of our links,

00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:29.395
we now see this blue color which are valid.

00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:31.950
Also the supplies, the product too,

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.730
and also the footer area too at the bottom.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.605
If we now go to our protocol inside of our index.html,

00:04:39.605 --> 00:04:42.875
let's scroll up to our first product,

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:44.900
which is just here.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.630
Here we have two sets of p elements.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.120
One for the price and then one for the description straight after.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.280
We can use a pseudo-class first of type to select the first one in this group,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.850
which will be our price.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.140
Back over to the styles.css.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.285
Just like we did with the links,

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:10.215
we can first select our elements add a colon,

00:05:10.215 --> 00:05:13.265
and then the name of our pseudo-class,

00:05:13.265 --> 00:05:16.380
which is first of type.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.285
For this one, we can also set the color and red will be fine.

00:05:23.285 --> 00:05:27.440
Go to the browser, refresh and now we can see

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.660
the first set of p elements in each section has now been set to red.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.835
In our case, this is the price and this is repeated for all elements too.

00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:40.820
There is also last of type too.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.370
Let's change this to be the last of type.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.060
The color red is also fine and you can probably imagine that

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.675
this will select the description once we refresh,

00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:54.280
because this is the last set of P tags within his group.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.765
This also works for other elements too,

00:05:56.765 --> 00:05:58.805
such as our list items.

00:05:58.805 --> 00:06:01.565
For example, we can change p to be

00:06:01.565 --> 00:06:07.135
li and this will select the last list item in each group.

00:06:07.135 --> 00:06:10.650
For example, the contact us down at the bottom,

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.080
the same for the header,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.005
and also for each group in a sidebar too.

00:06:15.005 --> 00:06:18.125
Not only can we select the first or the last element,

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:22.105
we can actually select any by using the nth type.

00:06:22.105 --> 00:06:25.175
If we wanted the third list item,

00:06:25.175 --> 00:06:29.450
we could use nth type which is N-T-H. Then we'll add

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.490
the brackets just after this and if we wanted to target the third list item in the group,

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.755
we add number 3, give that a save.

00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:44.010
Go to browser and now out third list item in each group is now selected.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.225
This number can be any of our choosing.

00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:49.670
I'm just going to delete this example

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.135
here and save that and restore the project back to how it was.

00:06:55.135 --> 00:06:58.865
If we bring up the finished version of the textile,

00:06:58.865 --> 00:07:01.115
I'm just going to throw a second tab.

00:07:01.115 --> 00:07:04.220
If we take a look at our finished product sections here,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.325
down at the bottom we have the links of more info and also add to cart.

00:07:09.325 --> 00:07:14.975
Using these pseudo-selectors, this is how we have the buttons as different styles.

00:07:14.975 --> 00:07:18.520
We add a different CSS for the last of type.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.450
Let's do this over in our version.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.010
If we go back over to the CSS, this time at the bottom,

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.440
we can also target the button,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.380
the colon, and then last of type.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.070
This time we'll apply it to the last button in each group.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.865
Let's change the background color to the blue type that we've seen before,

00:07:40.865 --> 00:07:45.910
which has a hex value of 0e69e9.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:53.730
Then finally, a color for the button of white. Then off to the browser.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.825
Now we have some nicer looking links at the bottom of each product.

00:07:58.825 --> 00:08:03.140
This is a first look at pseudo-classes and you can see how useful

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:08.130
they are for targeting certain elements depending on their states.
