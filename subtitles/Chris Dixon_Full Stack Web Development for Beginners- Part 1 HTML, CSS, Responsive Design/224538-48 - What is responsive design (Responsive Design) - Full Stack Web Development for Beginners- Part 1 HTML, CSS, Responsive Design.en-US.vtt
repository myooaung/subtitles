00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.420
When building our project so far,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.190
we have not given much thought to how this would look on different screen sizes.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.995
Here we see an example where we have the main content area with a sidebar.

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:19.500
This is common for viewing websites on desktops on larger screen devices.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.055
But what about mobile or small tablets?

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:25.845
If we only have a small screen size,

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:28.425
all these items side by side,

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:31.570
like this may not make sense.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.500
If we have less space available,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.080
we may want these items to be the full width of

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.380
the container or as you can see here on smaller sizes,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.330
you will often see the sections stacked on top of each other.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.130
Here we now only see the items stacked,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.750
but we also have the header,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.205
main and footer sections stuck too.

00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:57.710
This generally gives a mobile or tablet user

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.070
a better experience as the content is optimized for the screen size.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.315
One way to do this is to create a website like we've already done for desktops.

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:12.725
Then create a dedicated mobile and tablet version too.

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:17.635
Another popular way is what is called responsive web design.

00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:23.090
As he sounds, responsive web design is an approach which allows a design to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.430
change or respond to not only the screen size but the orientation and device type too.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.695
This means we can use the same code,

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:38.430
but with some adjustments based on the device it's been viewed on.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.935
We can see the issue if we return back to our project and then resize the browser.

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:51.335
If we click on the corner of the browser and then drag it across,

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:55.040
we see some responsiveness because we set the sidebar on

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.620
the left and the main section here to be in-line block.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.910
If we make the browser even smaller we begin to see that

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.070
the products start to get pushed off the edge of the viewport or the visible area.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.145
Google Chrome also has another tool for us to help.

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:19.469
If we right click and go to inspect,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.720
in the top left hand corner next to this inspector which

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.425
we've been using we also have the device toolbar.

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:30.890
Give this a click. If you're not using Chrome,

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.165
it's not a problem.

00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:35.540
You can either shrink the browser down to a smaller size like

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.275
this or if your browser has a similar viewer,

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:41.275
go ahead and open this up.

00:02:41.275 --> 00:02:45.310
This will give us a list of popular devices to preview

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.055
our designs on or how things such as iPhones,

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:52.660
iPods, and also some Android devices.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.910
If will look through some of the devices outside basically

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.630
looks like a zoomed out version of the desktop site.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.565
Let's try a larger screen,

00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:03.745
such as a iPod.

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:08.250
All we're doing here is just zooming out to fit all the content on the screen.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.080
We don't see any content adjusting or stuck in like we seen over in the slides.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.230
This is because we have not taken any steps yet to make the site

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.050
responsive but this is something we'll start to do in

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.140
the next video when we take a look at the viewport meta tag.
