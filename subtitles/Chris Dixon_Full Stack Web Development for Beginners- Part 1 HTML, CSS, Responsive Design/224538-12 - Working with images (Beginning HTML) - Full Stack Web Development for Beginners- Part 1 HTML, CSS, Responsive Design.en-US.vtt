00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.575
We've been mostly working with text-based elements so far.

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:07.890
Now it's time to add some images to our website.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.940
I have provided the same images I'm using as a download

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.095
free for use or you can of course download your own if you prefer.

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:19.395
And I have these images folder on the desktop,

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:22.365
which I'm going to drag into the project folder.

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:27.555
It simply contains six images which we're going to be using for the project.

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:32.595
So all I'm going to do is open up the textile project.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:36.465
Inside of there I am going to drag in this images folder.

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:42.915
So all wish to have now is the index.HTML alongside the images folder.

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:48.400
First, we need to go over to the index page and add the image elements.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.905
This has no content inside of it,

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:53.155
so it doesn't have a closing tag.

00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:57.500
So let's do this inside of our productive, which is just here.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.605
So let's go inside there,

00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:02.485
just above the title of game controller.

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:07.265
Let's add the image without the closing tag.

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:13.810
Inside of here we can add a source attribute to specify the location of the image.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.680
There are a few ways which you can do this.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.160
First, I want to look at including images from other websites.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:28.274
So if we go over to the web browser and then go to Google,

00:01:28.274 --> 00:01:32.080
if you search for Wikimedia Commons.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.575
Let's go to this top link here.

00:01:37.575 --> 00:01:42.335
The Wikimedia Commons website usually has a picture of the day.

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:45.395
So you also look a little different from this.

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:50.060
All we need to do if we go to right-click and go to copy

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:59.200
image address and then go over to our source and paste this in between the quotations.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.970
Just like that. Give that a save.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.335
If we go back over to our index page in the browser,

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:11.890
hit refresh, we now have an image inside of this product section.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.870
So although this works perfectly fine,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.510
link into images on other websites is generally not recommended.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.810
First of all, the image location is not under your control.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.220
So the website owner could move or remove it.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.685
Also, this method, which is known as hot linking,

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:37.340
should only be done if I have permission to do so from the website owner.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.135
A better way to do this is to use our own images.

00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:44.659
So therefore, we're in control of the location.

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.335
We've already added these images to our project folder,

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:51.215
inside of this images folder too.

00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:58.040
So instead, if we go back over to the sauce and then remove the longitudes added in.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.865
Inside here we specify a file path.

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:04.535
So we are inside the index page now,

00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:07.355
so we need to go inside of the images folder.

00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:10.535
So it's images forward slash.

00:03:10.535 --> 00:03:12.635
Inside of the images folder,

00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:16.665
we specify the name of the image which you want to add.

00:03:16.665 --> 00:03:21.295
So because we're creating a product for a game controller,

00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:22.825
and let's add the image,

00:03:22.825 --> 00:03:28.520
which is controller with the.jpg extension.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.850
So this needs to be exactly the same as the name inside here.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.920
Otherwise it won't work.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.280
The. jpg other end is a file type,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.270
and this is important too.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.130
If you're using your own images with different file type,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.525
such as.png, you will need to change this to reflect this.

00:03:49.525 --> 00:03:56.900
Also watch alpha jpg files to which is saved as JPEG just like that.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.400
So make sure that's saved.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.515
Then go over to the browser.

00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:04.530
There's the image of our Xbox controller.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.295
The image element also has some other attributes we can use too.

00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:12.315
An important attribute is alt.

00:04:12.315 --> 00:04:15.800
So back over. At the very end,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.190
we can also add the alt tag.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.750
Inside of here, we can set some texts.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.065
This is important because we can define

00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:28.220
a text alternative to use if the image cannot be loaded for

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.800
any particular reason or for

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.995
visually impaired people using screen reader software to view your page.

00:04:35.995 --> 00:04:37.520
So instead of the image,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:45.135
if there is a problem with the type in the text of game controller picture,

00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:47.160
just as an example.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.055
Also we can set the width and height of the image too.

00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:53.995
So outside of the quotations.

00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:56.615
Let's set the height.

00:04:56.615 --> 00:05:06.070
So the heights, let's set this to 300 and also the width equal to 300 too.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.530
So it will only set one of these venues,

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.425
such as the width or the height.

00:05:11.425 --> 00:05:14.225
The image will scale proportionally,

00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:17.180
keeping the size and width ratio the same as it currently

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.495
is and both the width and the height,

00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:23.665
can make the image look a little out of proportion.

00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:27.150
So save and refresh.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.099
So now we see it's 300 pixels by 300 pixels,

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:33.775
which makes the image look a little squashed.

00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:40.490
So instead, I'm just going to leave the width in place, remove the height.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.055
If we refresh the image now stays in proportion.

00:05:45.055 --> 00:05:47.790
So this is how we can add images.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.679
Next up, we will look at how to add hyperlinks to all projects.
