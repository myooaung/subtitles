00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.810
Now, is the time to get some more practice on your own.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.090
If you feel comfortable doing so.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.540
This time with links.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.785
If you go to the browser,

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:12.585
we have this product image,

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:16.695
linking to the product detail page, which we created.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:20.220
What I would like you to do in this video is also turn

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.550
the product title of game controller into a link too,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.635
which links the same product detail page.

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:32.345
Also, if we look at the finish version,

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:37.610
I'd like you to go ahead and create the More Info and Add to Cart links.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.425
Remember, we only have this one product so far,

00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:44.575
so just starting this under the one product is fine.

00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:48.980
All you need to do is add these two links using the A element

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.995
which you discovered with some text in between opening and closing tag.

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:56.734
Although these texts look like buttons,

00:00:56.734 --> 00:00:59.525
it's all just a case of adding some CSS,

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.145
which we'll do later.

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:06.395
All I'm expecting is some simple text which is a link when clicked on.

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:11.645
The More Info button can also link to the same product detail page,

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:15.655
just like we did for the image and also the title.

00:01:15.655 --> 00:01:20.430
However, you can leave an empty href attribute for this Add to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.555
Cart button as we don't have any pages to link to at the moment.

00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:30.365
Go ahead and give this a go or if you still a little unsure,

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:33.245
I will go ahead and do this now.

00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:39.610
Let's go back over to Visual Studio Code and start with the product title.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.540
Let's locate our product,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.095
which is just here on the all items.

00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:49.865
Let's begin with the product title of game controller.

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:56.170
Let's copy and copy to our place and then we can add our anchor tags.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.090
Then in-between opening, closing tag,

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.835
we can paste in a title of game controller,

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:05.990
then go ahead and add the href attributes inside

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.650
the opening tag and this is going to link to the product-detail.html page.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.120
Next up, we can add the two links for More Info and Add to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.525
Cart and I'm going to do this just after the description here.

00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:26.495
Let's make some space and at

00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:32.580
the first A tag and this is going to be with the texts of More Info.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.950
This is also linking to the same product detail page,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.500
so we can also add the href attribute.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.200
Our product-detail.html.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:56.560
Then our second link just below and this is for Add to Cart.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.915
We can also add the href attributes,

00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:02.195
but like I mentioned before,

00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:04.610
this is just going to be a empty string for

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.720
now as we don't have any HTML pages turning to.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.740
I'll give that Save of the browser.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:19.110
First, let's click on the game controller and it takes us to the product detail page.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.705
Scroll it down, we have More Info,

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:27.890
which also takes us to the same product detail page and Add to Cart,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.645
which still keeps us on the index.html page.

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:33.390
That's it now for the challenge,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.125
I hope you managed it and I will see you next,

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:39.420
where we'll take a look at semantic elements.
