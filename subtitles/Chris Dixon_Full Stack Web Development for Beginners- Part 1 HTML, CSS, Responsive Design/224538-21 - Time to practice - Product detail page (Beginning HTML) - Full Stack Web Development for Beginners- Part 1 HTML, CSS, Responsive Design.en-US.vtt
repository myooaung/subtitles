00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.565
Now is a great chance to go ahead and build your own HTML page.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:10.905
We've already created the product detail to our HTML page just here,

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:13.695
but we've added no content just yet.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:17.175
If we go over to the finished version here and click

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.670
on the product image, the first item.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.150
This is the final product detail to HTML page,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.880
which I would like you to try and copy.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.045
Remember, we just need to add the content.

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:32.370
I don't expect yours to look like this,

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.535
finished version until we add in the CSS.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.875
You can leave this table at the bottom.

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:41.940
I'll just for now, we'll add this one when we get to the tables lecture.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.170
We already have all the content we need to create this,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.545
we already have the header section,

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:49.485
we already have the sidebar,

00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:54.690
we have the footer section already and we also have one of these products.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.800
Therefore, we just need to replicate the index page,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.740
but this time only have one product,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.680
which is this controller.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.830
You can of course Copy the full index page and Paste it into

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.910
the product detail file and then remove the extra file products,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.175
but if you're new to all this,

00:01:13.175 --> 00:01:16.265
you may want to type it out for a bit more practice.

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:19.115
If you are still unsure, don't worry.

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:22.140
I'm going to go ahead and do this now.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.380
Back over to Visual Studio.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.160
I'm going to go to the index.html,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.360
press Command or Control A to select

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.400
all the code and then I'm going to Command or Control C to copy.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.070
Over to the product detail page,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.240
let's delete this text and then Paste in the same code as the index page.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.540
If you go up to the top,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:59.860
rub this text or we can also add to the end of it for the detail and give us save.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.110
Then if we scroll down to the products,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.350
so we have the sidebar which is fine and then all items.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.460
This first div is the one we want to keep for the controller.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.980
Let's remove all the extra items,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.265
so extra two items there,

00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:25.000
the microphone, the cables and finally the lenses.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.300
To move that and then move the main site backup.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.125
We just have one product inside of this main section along with the all items heading.

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:45.515
In fact, we can change this to product detail and then give us save,

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:49.270
go to the browser, hit Refresh.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.645
But let's go to our projects.

00:02:51.645 --> 00:02:56.870
Refresh this and then if we select the Game controller,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.660
will then take into the product detail page.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.505
We have the heading,

00:03:01.505 --> 00:03:03.440
we have the sidebar,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.645
and then the product details section,

00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:07.445
which is one product,

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:10.915
and then the footer area down at the very bottom.

00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:14.145
Yours should now look just like this.

00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:17.420
We have all the content we've seen from the final version,

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.900
except the table, which we'll look at in the next section.
