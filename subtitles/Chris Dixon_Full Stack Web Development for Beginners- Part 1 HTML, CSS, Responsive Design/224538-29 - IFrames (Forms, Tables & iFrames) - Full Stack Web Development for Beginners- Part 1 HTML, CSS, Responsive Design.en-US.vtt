00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.625
We now got to move away from forms and take a look at using iframes.

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:12.030
The iframe element is used to embed another HTML page into a web document.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.810
Like you see here on this finished Contact us page.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.430
We can also embed a page from another provider such as,

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.815
Google Maps, like we've done here.

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:28.365
It may sound a little strange but they'll become more clear when we see them in action.

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:32.145
Let's see this in the contact.html page.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:36.105
I'm going to add an iframe inside of here.

00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:40.125
I'm going to add this just after our form section.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:46.650
Let's scroll down and right at the end of our form,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.830
but still within this main section,

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.900
we can add to the iframe element.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.365
If we give that Save, and then refresh the browser inside of our project.

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:04.590
In fact we need to go to the Contact us page, and then scroll down.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.145
We see an empty iframe element at the very bottom.

00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:13.520
To get this to show something we need to add a source attribute,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.955
just like we did when working with images.

00:01:16.955 --> 00:01:21.815
The source attribute will point to the web page we want to embed.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:25.850
This can be as simple as display in one of our own web pages,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.185
such as product data.

00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:35.260
Let's add the source inside of here and link to our product-detail.html.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.030
I'll give that Save and let's see how it is looking.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.165
There's our product detail page inside this iframe or inside this window.

00:01:48.165 --> 00:01:52.280
Now we can scroll up, and down, and left, and right.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.050
This iframe is a little too small for the content.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.200
You can also use a height and width attribute to

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.535
re-size the iframe. Let's begin with the width.

00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:09.245
Let's go for 800 and a height of 600.

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:11.515
This value is in pixels,

00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:15.950
so it's an 800 by 600 pixel iframe.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.780
Now we have the iframe a little bigger on the screen there.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.135
The iframe can also be used to link to an external website,

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:29.210
but only if the website owner allows this.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.955
Currently, Wikipedia allows this,

00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:34.805
and we can see by typing in the source,

00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:37.945
so instead of productdetail.html,

00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:43.540
let's type in the full URL of https://wikipedia.org,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.070
and then give that a save.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.090
On to the browser, and we can see the Wikipedia website embedded.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.510
At the moment, Google does not allow us to do this.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.700
Let's link to google.com,

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.020
refresh, and we just see an empty iframe.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.110
We do need to be careful which websites we're linking

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.560
to and make sure that that is allowed.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.430
We can also add some fallback content if the embedded content cannot display.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.740
This can be added between the iframe opening and closing tag.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.940
Let's add our p-type to some text.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.030
Let's say your browser does not support iframes.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.155
Back to our projects, and reload.

00:03:46.155 --> 00:03:52.465
We don't see any different because this is only displayed if iframes are disabled,

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:58.150
or if it's viewed on a screen reading device for visually impaired people.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.855
We can also embed content from other websites too if they allow.

00:04:02.855 --> 00:04:08.695
YouTube is one of the websites which does allow us to embed an iframe into our projects.

00:04:08.695 --> 00:04:12.260
To do this, we can go over to youtube.com.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.235
Then all we need to do is find any video which we want to add.

00:04:21.235 --> 00:04:24.250
Let's just do a quick search for anything.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.480
I want to search for Elon Musk and click on any one of these videos.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.970
Then what we need to do is click on Share.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.865
If you go down to here, there's a share button.

00:04:37.865 --> 00:04:42.330
Click on this and then we click on embed.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.600
Then we can copy this iframe which is provided to us.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.155
We can see the closing and the opening iframe.

00:04:51.155 --> 00:04:53.825
Let's copy all this section,

00:04:53.825 --> 00:04:59.475
go back over, and we can add this in place of our current iframe.

00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:05.005
Let's remove this and paste in the YouTube version instead.

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:10.490
Give that a Save and now back over to our project, hit Reload,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:18.750
and now we have a YouTube embedded video and play button controls down at the bottom.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.945
This iframe also has some attributes too which we've not yet seen.

00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:29.330
If we scroll over to the right,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.195
we see we have Allow full screen.

00:05:32.195 --> 00:05:34.880
There is also frame border,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.730
which has a value of either zero or one.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.010
Zero means no border and one means to add a border.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.275
This allow full screen as it sounds.

00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:51.040
If we remove the attribute and then go over and play the video,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.960
so click on play, and if we try to click on full screen,

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.850
we can see that full screen is unavailable.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:06.690
However, attorneys packing will allow us to make the video full-screen once more.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.320
We play and there we go so now it's a the full size of our screen.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.305
Now we know a little bit more about iframes.

00:06:18.305 --> 00:06:23.640
In the next video, we can use them to add Google Maps to our projects.
