00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
We now move on to HTML tables.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:05.340
Tables as a sound,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.370
are used to display a table of data.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.750
We use a table here on the product detail page to

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.345
layout rows of data about any discounts available for buying in bulk.

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:21.480
Tables can be used for basically any type of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.650
data which you want to arrange into rows and columns.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.280
In the past, tables were being used for laying a website.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.380
For example, we could arrange all of our content we

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.010
see on this page into columns and rows.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.665
This is now discouraged as there is more CSS alternatives available now,

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:45.305
especially since grid and flexbox,

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:47.920
which we'll cover in this course.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.650
Tables always still have a valuable place and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.415
now it's a display data such as text or numbers,

00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:58.435
or even images in a structured way.

00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:03.195
Let's give us a go over in the product detail to a HTML file,

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:08.045
so back over to the text editor and then let's open up this file.

00:01:08.045 --> 00:01:12.065
Let's go down to the products,

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:16.420
so outside the sidebar and into the main area.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.300
Such as make a little bit of space straight after

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.910
the product but nobody is main section here.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.690
Then we can open up our table elements,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.935
which has the opening and closing tag,

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:32.495
and this is how we create the table.

00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:36.220
If we look at this table from the finished version,

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.255
just down here, we have two rows of data.

00:01:40.255 --> 00:01:43.720
Rows can be created by using need TR tags,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.980
which stands for table row.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.090
Let's go ahead and add these within our table.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.725
In our case are TR.

00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:59.645
Then let's add a second table row just below.

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:06.140
Each item or each cell for each row is surrounded in the TD tags,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.845
which stands for table data.

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:13.245
In our first row, we had quantity 1,

00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:17.740
2-3, 5-10, or 10 plus.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.940
You can add this inside the first row. We have TD.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.739
The first one was quantity,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.765
then sold in the first table row,

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:33.080
add some new TD tags of one.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:45.340
Then 2-3,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.200
5-10, and finally,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.550
10 plus, hit that "Save".

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.359
Now let's head over to the browser and make sure we open up our own project.

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.480
I'm going to go over to our project folder just here,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.300
and then we can open up these index or HTML.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.005
Of course ours looks a lot different because we haven't added any CSS just yet.

00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:16.135
But we can still click on the links.

00:03:16.135 --> 00:03:20.635
Let's go down to the game controller to open up this product detail page.

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:22.785
There's our first row see,

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:25.065
just blow the products.

00:03:25.065 --> 00:03:27.140
Back over to the text editor.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.135
We can do this one more time for the price row.

00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:34.760
Just underneath the first TR,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.135
we can add small TD tags.

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:41.130
This time the first one was price,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:54.870
so 7995, and this one a little bit cheaper, let's say 7895.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.485
Each one of these will correspond with the number adjustable.

00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:05.820
TD again, let's say 7695.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:14.595
We could add 7495 inside there, hit "Save".

00:04:14.595 --> 00:04:17.135
Back onto the browser and reload,

00:04:17.135 --> 00:04:20.195
and now have two rows and data.

00:04:20.195 --> 00:04:24.035
Is HTML with added for the website's content,

00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:26.690
is exactly the same for both our version so

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.370
far and also the final version we seen before.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.840
The CSS styling really plays a big part in a websites look and feel.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.325
A lot of table attributes such as align on background color.

00:04:40.325 --> 00:04:43.190
But being deprecated in HTML 5,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.300
which now famous styling with CSS.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.760
We used to do things such as adding borders and

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.390
aligning text inside the table, just like this.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.340
When I add a board attributes,

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.620
set it a one pixel wide,

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.690
we could align the text inside the center,

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.145
save that, and reload.

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:09.305
Even though it is currently works in my browser,

00:05:09.305 --> 00:05:13.715
again, is recommended to do styling using CSS.

00:05:13.715 --> 00:05:17.645
We can also replace TD with TH.

00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:21.755
This is for the table header which makes a content bold.

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:24.980
This is useful for the top row of this table,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.675
which is the quantity.

00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:30.685
Let's go ahead and replace the top row with TH.

00:05:30.685 --> 00:05:36.110
These TDs exchanges to be TH.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.730
Do this on all of them,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.990
which

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.700
grew furthermore one-by-one and replace TDs with THs,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.615
and one to do now give us save and let's see what effect this has.

00:05:58.615 --> 00:06:04.160
Now we've got the top row as being bold because this is a table heading.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.025
This is basic table setup.

00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:10.550
But we can go even further and add some more structure to

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.965
this table if we take a look at the finished version.

00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:19.235
Let's go to the product detail and open a new tab.

00:06:19.235 --> 00:06:21.995
If we look at this table just here,

00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:24.214
just like a HTML documents,

00:06:24.214 --> 00:06:26.315
we can split it up into a header,

00:06:26.315 --> 00:06:28.850
a body, and a footer section.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.195
The top row with the quantity can be used for the header.

00:06:32.195 --> 00:06:34.880
The price data can then be the body.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.255
We don't have a good use for the footer tags in his example,

00:06:38.255 --> 00:06:40.475
but they are there if we need them.

00:06:40.475 --> 00:06:44.450
Also working on a caption at the top of the table too,

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.540
which we've added here, we buy in bulk and save.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.275
Let's go over to the project and give this a go.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:55.400
First, we can have the table headings with T head.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.740
Surrounding this table row,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.680
we can add a new elements of T head.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.735
Then we can coats our first table row,

00:07:06.735 --> 00:07:11.705
over that, and paste it back inside his table head section.

00:07:11.705 --> 00:07:17.320
Then we can surround the prices with T body for this body section.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.585
Our T body into there,

00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:28.035
and copy this table row and paste it in the body section.

00:07:28.035 --> 00:07:31.165
We could add more rows to if required,

00:07:31.165 --> 00:07:35.340
or even a footer area with a T foot, both.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.790
Now let's keep that save and reload the browser.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.755
We see no change to the content.

00:07:41.755 --> 00:07:45.445
But now our table has a more descriptive structure,

00:07:45.445 --> 00:07:49.330
just like when we looked at semantic elements early on.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.205
Now for the caption,

00:07:51.205 --> 00:07:53.785
which acts as a heading for the table,

00:07:53.785 --> 00:07:56.935
which is this text just here.

00:07:56.935 --> 00:08:00.054
Let's go back to the top of the table,

00:08:00.054 --> 00:08:03.200
just below this opening table elements.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.330
We can add our caption inside here,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.810
and then it adds texts just like we do with the T tags.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:14.110
Buy in bulk and save.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.820
Then back to the detail page and reload.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.090
Now as our text at the top,

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:28.285
you can see this text is centered to the table by default.

00:08:28.285 --> 00:08:31.090
The final thing I want to show you for now,

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.630
with tables is the colspan attributes.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.570
We can add this to a cell such as TD or

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:42.160
TH to make that particular cell the width of two or more.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.785
If you're familiar with Microsoft Excel,

00:08:44.785 --> 00:08:49.015
this is the same as merging cells together across a row.

00:08:49.015 --> 00:08:51.970
Let's give this a go inside the header section,

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.875
to begin by making a quantity span across two cells.

00:08:56.875 --> 00:09:01.735
The quantity TH, we can have the colspan attributes,

00:09:01.735 --> 00:09:04.580
and upset is equal to two.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:11.915
Refresh, and now quantity spans the width of the two cells below.

00:09:11.915 --> 00:09:16.415
We could do the same inside the body for the price.

00:09:16.415 --> 00:09:21.210
Add colspan equals two.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:27.600
Now the price also takes up the width of two cells too.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.655
I'm just going to quickly remove what we don't need for this project.

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:33.755
We don't need these colspan gin.

00:09:33.755 --> 00:09:37.295
We can need the standard table in for now.

00:09:37.295 --> 00:09:41.715
Remove those two. We also don't need this border,

00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:44.090
and the align properties too,

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.540
this is it now, but I will first look at HTML tables.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.170
Next, we'll move on to capturing user input waveforms.
