00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
The final stage of adding styles for

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.935
larger desktop size screens is pretty much already taken care of.

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:10.275
We already have them in place.

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:12.765
These are the ones we commented out earlier.

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:17.085
We just need to decide what screen size we want these to take effect for.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:20.640
Then, we can move them to a separate media query.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.475
Again, if we open up the developer tools,

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:26.340
right-click and inspect, then we can widen

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.625
the browser to a size where we want to add the breakpoints.

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:33.105
So let's keep going until this looks a little stretched.

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:36.450
Currently, this takes effect at 800 pixels,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.380
which is just here, and then make it a little bit bigger.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.764
So maybe about 1000 pixels,

00:00:45.764 --> 00:00:49.515
somewhere around there, the content looks a little stretched.

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.090
At a 1000 pixels,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.955
I'm going to add a new media query.

00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:56.090
Down on the very bottom,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.965
outside of this curly brace,

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:06.180
we can again use the @media rule and then set the minimum width to be 1000 pixels.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.095
Let's begin by scrolling up to the main on the sides section.

00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:15.035
If you remember from earlier,

00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:17.675
we commented out both the sections.

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:22.325
Let's now cut both the sections out of place.

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:26.940
Then, we can go ahead and add this inside of our media query.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.100
Paste these inside of our second media query.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.580
Then uncomment out both of the sections.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.590
Give that a save, and then over to the browser,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.055
and then refresh. Let's try resizing.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.620
So over 1000 pixels,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.575
we see things are starting to look a little bit better,

00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:54.125
but there's still a few small changes to make,

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:58.785
such as the header and also the text-alignment is still in the sensor.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.535
The text-alignment is an easy fix.

00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:05.470
We just need to set the body to be aligned to the left.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.055
Just above the main section,

00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:10.435
let's add the body.

00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:17.620
Then set the text line to be in the left and there we go.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.450
We've now pushed our links over to the left and also the header content too.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.205
This header section also,

00:02:24.205 --> 00:02:29.305
we change the site title from 70 percent wide to be 100 percent.

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:32.225
We did this with the header h1.

00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:36.975
Let's go further up the page and there's a header h1.

00:02:36.975 --> 00:02:40.785
Now let's remove these comments, cut out place.

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:44.080
Then, we can reapply this down in a media query.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.220
So back down to the bottom and let's go just after the body section.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.580
The header h1 was a selector.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.660
Then paste this in and take a look at this.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.810
Then if we resize the browser back to 1000 pixels,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.204
we can see the breakpoints

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:08.315
straightaway where the layout will change because our media query.

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:11.480
I think we can add one final media query to

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.675
this project when the screen is a little wider.

00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:19.345
This is so we can go back to having our three products on each row.

00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:21.555
Let's go back to the developer tools,

00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:24.810
so we can see the browser width, and then,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.015
if we stretch the browser a little wider,

00:03:27.015 --> 00:03:30.825
so currently the breakpoint happens just here.

00:03:30.825 --> 00:03:37.844
Then keep going and let's say around 1200 pixels,

00:03:37.844 --> 00:03:41.320
we'll then make the products appear three on each row.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.025
Another media query right at the very bottom, we've @media.

00:03:48.025 --> 00:03:52.950
This time was at the minimum width to be 1200 pixels.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.235
Just like that. To kick things off in this larger media query,

00:04:00.235 --> 00:04:05.545
remember early on we set the maximum width to 80 percent of the viewport width.

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:09.470
We then commented out this section for the mobile sizes.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.920
Let's cut the section of the body and then we

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.820
can reapply it down at the bottom for the largest screens.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.480
Add this inside the 1200 pixels media query and then uncomment out this section.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.880
We need to add the body, of course,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.710
and then the curly braces, then refresh.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.305
This now sets the body to be 80 percent of the width for the viewport.

00:04:35.305 --> 00:04:41.995
Then we can make the products 30 percent wide each two to allow three to fit on each row.

00:04:41.995 --> 00:04:49.509
Let's target the top product and then set the width to be 30 percent,

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.730
back over and reload.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.845
We pretty much now complete.

00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:57.050
It looks like one of the only differences from

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.335
the original site is this search box just here,

00:05:00.335 --> 00:05:03.385
which was alongside this links on the right.

00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:05.190
Let's try and fix this now,

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.215
all of in the media query.

00:05:07.215 --> 00:05:14.170
We can select the inputs with the type of search.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.675
Then let's try and make this a little bit narrower.

00:05:18.675 --> 00:05:23.615
Let's say 20 percent at this end and then reload.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:26.000
We can see that it still does not fit.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.950
We can try to reduce the width of the site title to give us more space.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.385
Let's try the header h1,

00:05:33.385 --> 00:05:37.650
which is in the 1000 pixels media query.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.065
Let's try changing this to be 60 percent and then refresh.

00:05:43.065 --> 00:05:46.615
Now, there's enough space for these all to fit on the screen.

00:05:46.615 --> 00:05:49.125
Let's just see what we've done here.

00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:52.175
If we stretch the browser to be full width,

00:05:52.175 --> 00:05:55.955
we now have our site looking pretty much as it was originally.

00:05:55.955 --> 00:06:00.595
As we shrink it down, we can see the content flows to be smaller.

00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:04.685
It'll have a breakpoint, make two products appear on each row.

00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:06.560
Then, as we get smaller,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.985
we have another breakpoint to make sure that the main and the sides action appear

00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:15.810
stacked on top of each other still having the two products side-by-side.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.565
Then even further to the mobile and small tablet view.

00:06:19.565 --> 00:06:22.580
We can see we have one product on each line.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.425
This is now looking a lot more optimized for smaller screens.

00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:29.120
Well done if this is all working for you.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.460
Remember, these breakpoint numbers are

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.115
flexible and you will need to base them on whatever content you're working with.

00:06:36.115 --> 00:06:39.645
You've now made your first project now responsive.

00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:42.330
So we just have different screen devices.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.620
Next we're going to take a look at using responsive images.
