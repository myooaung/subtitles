00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.650
In the HTML sections we have covered so far,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.945
we've referred to the finished website to show what we will be adding to our projects.

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:13.260
Right now, our own project we have been creating

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.460
contains the exact same HTML content as a finished version.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.775
But as we know they look very different.

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:23.730
The difference is the CSS.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.495
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:31.980
It is a style sheet language used for describing the look and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.605
formatting of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.

00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:40.135
This is a formal description,

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:43.714
but you can think of CSS as a way of styling,

00:00:43.714 --> 00:00:48.220
positioning, and laying out elements in our websites.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.420
We can use it to adds colors, borders,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.430
alignment, text size, background colors, and so much more.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.670
Using CSS keeps our styling separate from the HTML content.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.940
This separation keeps all files smaller and more maintainable.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.965
We can still mix styles into our HTML file,

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:13.790
and we'll look at some ways to do this.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.460
Well, anything other than a small website will usually have HTML in one file,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.829
with a.html extension, and then CSS in a separate file with a.css extension.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.550
Having a separate CSS file also allows

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.060
the same styles to be reused across multiple HTML files.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.235
CSS3 is the latest version.

00:01:40.235 --> 00:01:45.845
It allows us to do even more with new features such as transformations,

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:50.180
animations, gradients, body images,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.385
rounded corners, and media queries.

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:57.625
We will of course cover these in more details soon.

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:00.765
So what does CSS look like?

00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:04.380
Well, on the screen here are some examples.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.710
First, we can select an element by its name, such as h1.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.575
There are many ways to select an element.

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:14.840
Will look at these soon too.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.850
Then we add some curly braces to contain the style rules we want to apply to this h1.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.200
Same with the header just below,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.825
this header will have a width of 70 percent with a white background.

00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:33.690
Now we know a bit about what CSS is.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.650
Now let's move on to automate our projects.
