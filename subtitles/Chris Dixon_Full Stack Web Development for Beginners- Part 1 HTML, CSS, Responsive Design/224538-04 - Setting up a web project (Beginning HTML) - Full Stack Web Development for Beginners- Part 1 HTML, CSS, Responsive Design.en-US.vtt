00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.819
During the next few sections,

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:06.450
we'll be learning about the basics of HTML and CSS.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.500
We'll also be applying these techniques to a project as you learn

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.970
them to show you how all these apply to a real website.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.730
The project to be a Tech Store display

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.870
some products and also how some different areas such as headers,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.810
footers and also sidebar.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.930
It will only have basic functionality such as

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.870
clicking on an item to see the full products.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.250
Those will give us a good chance to get some HTML and CSS practice.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.220
When beginning any new web projects,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.605
we first need to create a project folder to store all the files,

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:48.215
folders, images and any other assets relating to the project.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:52.010
To begin, we're going to go over to the Desktop and create

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.345
a new folder by right-clicking and then New Folder.

00:00:56.345 --> 00:01:01.410
I'm going to call this the name of our project, which is Tech-store.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.620
You can of course,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.685
create this folder anywhere on your computer which you prefer.

00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:11.300
Then I'm going to open up Visual Studio Code which

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.230
is the text editor I'm going to be using for the rest of this course.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.450
Open that up, all your preferred text editor and you can either drag the folder in.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.810
Open that up and you see the name in a sidebar on the left.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.250
Or you can go to file and then open and select it from there.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.525
Now need to create our first web documents or our file.

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:40.070
Again, depending on your text editor there may be few ways to do this.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.125
In Visual Studio code,

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:47.600
you can use Command and N on a Mac to open up a new file.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.780
Or on Windows it may be Control plus N. Also most text editors have an option again,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.690
of going to the File and then New File at the top there.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.080
I'm going to click on "New File" from there and then I'm going to

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.065
call this the index.html.

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:11.895
All HTML pages need to have this.HTML extension at the end.

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:17.315
So the browser knows that this is a HTML file. Hit "Enter."

00:02:17.315 --> 00:02:20.255
We can name this file anything we want,

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:24.245
and we'll create multiple HTML files for this first project.

00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:29.260
But index is a common name for the website default or homepage.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.160
So make sure this is inside of

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.540
the Tech Store project and then we go over to the edit area on the right.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.270
If we type in some texts such as,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.790
hello, get that saved.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.310
Then if we open up our project folder and then double-click on the index.html page,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.280
open this up inside the browser,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.560
and there we see our text of,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.810
hello, inside the browser.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.620
Of course, we know from the last section that we need to surround

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.695
this text with P tags for it to be valid.

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:03.560
But for now our project is all set up and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.040
ready to just now move on to structure in our index page.
