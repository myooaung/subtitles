00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
With the project folder now setup,

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:07.020
we can now begin to add some structure to our index page.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.885
Before we begin to add our HTML elements,

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:11.940
to add content to our page,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.270
there is some basic structure we first need to add.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm going to start by removing this hello text from the last video,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.905
and the first thing we need to add at the very top of

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:27.435
each page is a DOCTYPE declaration, which looks like this.

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:30.645
If you open and close the angle brackets,

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:32.790
add an exclamation mark,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.660
and then type DOCTYPE of HTML.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.670
DOCTYPE declarations are a way to declare which version of HTML we are using.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.300
This is a DOCTYPE for HTML version 5.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.310
Earlier versions were a lot longer and more complicated.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.145
Well, HTML5 makes things nice and simple for us.

00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:58.520
The word DOCTYPE is not case sensitive,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.960
but I like to type mine in uppercase anyway.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.875
Then we add the main or the root HTML element tags.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.320
So just below the DOCTYPE,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.035
open and close the angle brackets,

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:16.755
type in HTML, and then when this closes off,

00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:19.410
again, open and close your angle brackets,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.740
add a forward slash and HTML.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.815
With this being the root element,

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:27.970
everything else must be added between these tags.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.640
This top type at the top is the only exception to this.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.235
Inside of the opening HTML tag,

00:01:34.235 --> 00:01:36.545
I'm going to add a attribute.

00:01:36.545 --> 00:01:40.070
We briefly talked about attributes in the last section.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.635
Attributes are just a way for us to provide

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:47.320
some additional information which we need to add to the opening tag.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.055
For the HTML tag,

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:53.450
we can provide the language attributes with lang.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:00.070
This tells browsers and search engines the language of the web page which we're creating.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.655
I'll be creating this site in English,

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:05.640
so the code is equal to en,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.145
inside of these quotations.

00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:13.780
A quick Google search for HTML language codes will bring up a list of country codes,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.590
if you wish to use a different language.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.220
Inside of this HTML elements,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.075
there is two main elements we can now add,

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.295
called the head and the body.

00:02:24.295 --> 00:02:26.650
So just underneath these opening tag,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.880
we can open up the brackets again and type in the head and close that.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.550
You can see that Visual Studio code automatically completes as follows.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.610
If your text editor doesn't,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.590
just simply go ahead and type in the closing tag with the forward slash.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.230
After this we can add the body.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.990
This again has a opening and a closing tag too.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:00.145
This head section at the very top contains data about the website, often called metadata.

00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:03.040
The content we add to the head is not usually

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.210
displayed on the page inside the browser, it does, however,

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.770
provide some important information about the HTML document,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.070
such as the site title,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.335
information of search engines.

00:03:16.335 --> 00:03:18.835
We can also link it to all the files too,

00:03:18.835 --> 00:03:21.470
and we'll look at this during inception.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.295
The first element I'm going to add to the head section is a meta tag.

00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:29.750
Meta tags basically provide information about

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.745
the site and it's the first self-closing tag we've seen so far.

00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:37.730
This means it doesn't have a closing tag.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.570
It doesn't need one because we don't add any content inside,

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.510
we simply add a attribute to it.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.360
There are lots of different meta tags available to provide

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.380
information about the site's description, the site's offer.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.295
We can also use it to add keywords too.

00:03:54.295 --> 00:03:58.160
For this one though, all I'm going to do is add a character set,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.715
used for the site, with the charset attributes.

00:04:01.715 --> 00:04:08.025
So let's create our meta tag, M-E-T-A, close off,

00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:11.900
and then we can add our character set attributes

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.285
and this is going to be equal to UTF hyphen 8.

00:04:17.285 --> 00:04:21.500
Setting a character encoding may sound complicated,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.485
but we're simply declaring which characters we're using on this web page.

00:04:26.485 --> 00:04:29.329
The character has been in numbers, letters,

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:33.440
and also any character symbols which you'll find on your keyboard,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.180
such as the at symbol and also positive and negative symbols, or even brackets.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.695
UTF-8 is a HTML5 standard,

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:47.830
requires almost all the characters available in the world.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.490
Next up, just below this meta tag,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.965
I'm going to add the title.

00:04:52.965 --> 00:04:58.015
So at the title is opening and closing tags.

00:04:58.015 --> 00:05:03.870
I'm going to call mine the tech store and we need to add this between the two tags.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.775
So under n just like that.

00:05:06.775 --> 00:05:13.100
If we give that a save and then open up the browser with index.html opened,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.195
give that a refresh,

00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:19.320
and we can see we've got tech store at the top of the browser, just there.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.360
We'll add to this head section throughout this project,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.090
and also later on in this course.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.305
This now leaves us with this body section.

00:05:28.305 --> 00:05:32.420
The body is where we add all the content which will appear on the page.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.210
If we go ahead and type our hello again,

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.985
just below the body like this.

00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:41.475
Give that a save and then reload the browser.

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:44.830
We see the text now appear again on the page.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.125
Great. Our HTML structure is now in place,

00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:49.880
and we can now move on to looking at

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.750
some more HTML elements which we'll add to this body section.
