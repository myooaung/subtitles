00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.795
We have so far covered adding styles in line and also using internal style sheets.

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:10.845
The third and final type is a external style sheets.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:12.540
We see in the last video,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.990
that a limitation of using internal style sheets,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.690
is that they only apply to one web page.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.410
We don't want to repeat the header and footer styles for each page.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.800
You can add them to an external style sheets rather than only applying to our index page,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.690
which you see our presence.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.400
We can do this by creating a new file inside of our project folder.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.940
I'm going to click on this icon here to open up the sidebar.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.560
I'm going to create a new file by clicking on this icon here.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.470
I'm going to call this "styles.css" The names of [inaudible] ,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.930
but it must have the ".css" extension and then hit "Enter".

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm just going to save this into the roots of our project folder.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.720
Along with this index and all the other HTML pages.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.165
We can also add a CSS folder if you have multiple stylesheet files,

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:16.415
then we can go over to the index page and styles which you already have.

00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:19.760
So let's scroll down and everything from the header and footer,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.995
right up to the HTML.

00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:24.140
So cut this out.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.640
But I'm just going to leave this style tags in place and then paste these in

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.750
the styles.css file that we just created, hit "save".

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.130
If we go over to the browser and then hit "refresh",

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.175
we see no styling is applied at all now.

00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:42.005
This is because we need to link

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:46.945
this new CSS file to the HTML files we want it to apply to.

00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:50.025
So let's go ahead and do this now.

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:52.700
Over in the index.html,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.815
we can remove the style tags,

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:58.510
and in place I'm going to add the link elements.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.365
The link has no closing tag and we can add two attributes.

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:05.720
The first is rel,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.450
and we add equal stylesheets.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.625
Rel equals stylesheet describes the relationship of the linked documents to the chromo.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:18.850
We're linking the stylesheets.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.120
Then the href attribute,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.305
which you should be familiar with from when we looked at links.

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:28.460
This is the path to the CSS file which you just created.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.415
Misses in the same directory is the index page.

00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:36.035
So we can just add the name of styles.css.

00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:38.675
If we had in a CSS file,

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:43.825
we would need to add CSS as a file path before the file.

00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:47.465
So let's just remove that and give us save.

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:52.180
Now refreshing should introduce our styles back onto the page.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.719
We should still see If we go up to over pages such as contact,

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.405
that none of these styles still apply.

00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:04.970
We can change this by linking to all of the pages using the same link here.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.525
So I'm just going to copy this and then add this to the contact.html.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:14.570
Is it going to be right at the top as well?

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.140
Just after the title?

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.825
Then the same for the product detail.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:24.740
Right at the very top below the title.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.355
Paste this in. Now if we go to [inaudible] over HTML pages in the browser.

00:03:31.355 --> 00:03:33.815
So we have our homepage.

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:38.695
let's try to contact page and our styles still apply there.

00:03:38.695 --> 00:03:43.415
Does look a little smaller if we just zoomed in and with the browser there.

00:03:43.415 --> 00:03:48.700
So homepage is all working the contact us page,

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.890
and we'll still have the styles for the header and the footer.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.310
Finally, let's go back to the whole page and select the product data.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.375
Our styles applied to this page too.

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:04.505
This is how we can add external style sheets to our projects.

00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:07.620
Next we'll look at in Google fonts.
