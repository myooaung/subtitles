00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
Another important consideration when designing for different sized devices,

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.755
is the images which we use.

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:10.724
If we provide a small image on a website,

00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:13.095
it may suit a small device,

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:15.015
but when on larger screens,

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.405
it will start to become stretched and not look very good,

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:21.120
or if our image is too large,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.340
it will take longer to download on mobile devices,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.689
or places with slower Internet connections.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.975
The picture elements can provide a solution for this.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:37.795
This picture element acts as a container where we can add multiple image sources.

00:00:37.795 --> 00:00:44.815
A common use is to provide different image sizes to apply for different sized devices.

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:48.890
We also need some different size images to use too.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.840
For this example, you can go ahead and use any image which you may already have.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.180
All you need to do is save it three times in three different sizes, such as 300,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.495
600, and 1,000 pixels wide,

00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:07.895
or if you prefer, I provided some images for you to download.

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:12.245
I have these images saved on the desktop as a 300,

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:16.220
600, and 1,000 pixels wide version.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.400
So to begin, I'm going to create a new project.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.450
Let's right-click and go to New Folder,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.920
and I'm going to call this the picture elements.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.560
So then let's open this up in a text editor.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.190
Again, I'll be using Visual Studio Code and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.460
then we can go ahead and drag our three images into there.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.370
Then let's open up the project folder inside of Visual Studio by dragging it over,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.135
then our index page.

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:52.430
So let's close the welcome file,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.420
let's create a new file, called the index.html.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.925
To begin, we need our standard HTML structure,

00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.200
including the doc type,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.275
the head, and the body section.

00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:08.105
Of course, go ahead and type this all out,

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:09.544
if you need some practice,

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:12.065
or if you're using Visual Studio Code,

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.375
you can type HTML, colon,

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:16.835
5 and hit the tab key,

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:20.110
and then we get all the structure provided for us.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.500
Let's close the sidebar,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.440
and first let's add a title of picture elements,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.905
give that a save, and then we can open this up inside the browser.

00:02:32.905 --> 00:02:35.485
So go to the index.html,

00:02:35.485 --> 00:02:38.730
and I'm going to open mine in Google Chrome.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.915
Inside the body section we add the picture elements,

00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:50.420
just like any other elements, so,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.985
we add the picture opening and closing tags.

00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:59.825
Inside here we can add an image just like we would normally do,

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:03.395
so, IMG and then close it off.

00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:05.390
Inside here I'm going to add to

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.480
the image source and this is going to be the pizza-300.JPG.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.785
So this is the smallest image which I have saved.

00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:19.025
If you're using your own images with different names,

00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:22.840
of course, go ahead and add the name which you saved as.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.430
This image element is required as a fallback,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.030
for if the browser does not support the picture elements.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.470
Almost browsers do now have full support for this, so,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.830
give that a save and now we should see the 300 pixels wide image in the browser.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.535
We're now going to go ahead and add some more sources.

00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:46.550
This image element is also the fallback,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.415
if none of these source elements are matched.

00:03:49.415 --> 00:03:53.070
Let's take a look at how we can add these in now.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.535
Just above the image,

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:58.075
we can add the source elements.

00:03:58.075 --> 00:04:00.185
This doesn't have a closing tag,

00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:03.959
but instead we add the source set attributes

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.635
and set this equal to our image they want to use.

00:04:08.635 --> 00:04:16.830
So the next size image up was pizza 600.JPG,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.089
then we add the media attributes,

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.745
just like we've seen in the last few videos,

00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:25.010
where we can add a condition,

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.200
where will this image to appear.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.330
So just like we've seen in previous videos,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.400
inside the brackets, we can set the minimum width to be 600 pixels.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.490
This means that this 600 pixels wide image will

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.165
display if the screen is wider than 600 pixels.

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:49.115
If not, this defaults of fallback image will be used.

00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:52.955
Give that a save, reload,

00:04:52.955 --> 00:04:58.280
and now we see the 600 pixels wide image has now replaced the smaller one.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.080
We can also add more source elements too.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.660
Let's do the same for the 1,000 pixels image will have here.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.035
So just above this,

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:12.555
add the source once more,

00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:20.220
again with the source sets and this time it pizza 1,000.JPG.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.800
Again, we also need to add the media attributes inside the bracket,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.855
you can set the minimum width.

00:05:26.855 --> 00:05:29.000
This time to be 1,000

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.720
pixels and make sure he

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.690
goes looks like this with the brackets inside of the quotations like that.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.290
So just a recap, this pizza 300 is a fallback image.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.675
If none of these conditions are met once a browser gets over 600 pixels wide,

00:05:47.675 --> 00:05:50.650
we then load up the pizza 600.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.030
Once a browser gets even wider,

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.355
up to 1,000 pixels and above,

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.565
we then get this larger image loaded.

00:05:58.565 --> 00:06:04.025
We can prove this is working by going over to the browser and then reloading.

00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:08.345
We initially see the larger 1,000 pixels wide image,

00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:13.050
but we can see this is working if you go into the developer tools.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.430
Then if we go to the network.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.240
So let's begin by shrinking the browser to our smallest size,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.680
which is under 600 pixels. Then reload.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.810
To begin with, if we look down at the bottom,

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.195
we can see that these two files being loaded,

00:06:29.195 --> 00:06:31.820
we have the index.html page,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.155
then we have the pizza-300.

00:06:35.155 --> 00:06:39.495
If we drag the browser now over 600 pixels,

00:06:39.495 --> 00:06:42.740
we now see a third file has been downloaded,

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.815
and this is our pizza-600.

00:06:45.815 --> 00:06:48.310
The same for the larger image too,

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.040
if we now drag this to be over 1,000 pixels,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.455
we now have the pizza-1,000 image loaded too.

00:06:56.455 --> 00:07:02.435
So this picture element is ideal for providing the right size image for each device.

00:07:02.435 --> 00:07:07.750
It's also worth noting that we've used the media attributes with the minimum width.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.570
We can also use any other valid media query type,

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.645
which we already seen over in the CSS,

00:07:14.645 --> 00:07:17.870
such as orientation, max-width,

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.835
min-height, and so on.

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:23.070
So it's really flexible to use.
