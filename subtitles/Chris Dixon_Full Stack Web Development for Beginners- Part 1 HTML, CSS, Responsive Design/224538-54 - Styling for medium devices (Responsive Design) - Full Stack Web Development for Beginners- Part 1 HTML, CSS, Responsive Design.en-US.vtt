00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.505
We now have a good base to build on with our mobile styles. Now looking better.

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.730
The next stage is to widen the browser and decide

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.070
the width where our design starts to break or no longer look good.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.120
This of course, is a matter of opinion and personal preference.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.510
But if we go to the browser and open up the developer tools,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.150
we can then start to widen the browser.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.435
Let's go down to inspect,

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:31.249
and then let's starts to stretch the browser to resize,

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.125
which no longer starts look good on my devices.

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:40.940
Let's say when we get to about 800 pixels and start to scroll down,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.290
we see our design starts look a little stretched.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.239
Now maybe a good idea to put a media query in place as 800 pixels,

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.255
and then rather than one product being too stretched,

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:56.165
we can maybe put two products side-by-side,

00:00:56.165 --> 00:00:57.920
scrolling up to the top.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.415
We can also see that the search is looking a little stretched too,

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:03.655
so we can also fix this.

00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:06.830
Over to our styles.css,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.450
let's give us a bit more space and then go down to the bottom.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.070
Just like we've seen earlier, we can use the @media rule.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.875
Then inside of the brackets,

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:25.720
we can set the minimum width to be 800 pixels.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.520
Let's begin with the inputs with the type of search,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.080
and this is one for the header.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.995
Then inside here, remember we set the value to be a 100% wide.

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:48.330
We can now override this on the largest screens and set the width to be 40%.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.950
Let's save, and then reload.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.150
This now leaves enough space for the search and also the links to be inline.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.320
But at the moment that a little bit too close together.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.505
This can be fixed by adding a little margin on the left hand side of the inputs,

00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:09.785
on the left hand side.

00:02:09.785 --> 00:02:15.395
This can be 2em, which is two times the size it would normally be.

00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:17.705
Save and then reload,

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:22.040
and there is a little bit of spacing now between the links and the search.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.920
This now makes the header look a bit better.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.365
Now down onto the products.

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:30.275
Culminated product looks a little too stretched,

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:34.010
so we may look better with two products on each row.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.280
Remember in the last video we commented out inside

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.425
the product section the display type of inline block,

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:44.010
which we had just here.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.920
Instead of going to cut this outer place,

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.705
and then add inside the media query and then go down.

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:53.240
Inside the media query,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:02.825
we need to again target the.product and then paste in our display type of inline block,

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:04.790
and make sure all these styles,

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.590
which we are adding still within the opening and closing tag for this media query.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.250
Then over to the browser and then refresh.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.685
So we don't see much of a difference because

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:20.540
still we have our product set to be 100% wide.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.385
We can also override this in the media query by setting the width.

00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:31.210
I'm going to add two onto each row by setting a width of 50%.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.990
Refresh, and we see this still has the same problem of each product on a new line.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.120
We can change this by narrowing the product slightly

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.720
to account for any margin or padding which is added.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.100
Let's start with 49%,

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.760
and still not enough.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.445
Let's try 48%.

00:03:53.445 --> 00:03:57.080
Excellent. We now have two products on each row,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.430
and now if we shrink the browser down to under 800 pixels,

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.015
we see we have the products at a 100% wide,

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:07.420
and then over 800 pixels,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.740
it changes to be at two on each row.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.610
This is now looking good on smaller and medium-sized devices.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.085
In the next video we'll finish things off by adding back-in,

00:04:19.085 --> 00:04:25.710
the styles which we commented out earlier into a media query for desktop size screens.
