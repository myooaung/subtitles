00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.220
In the last few videos,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.005
we've concentrated on setting up

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:09.375
a website project along with adding the basic structure for our index page.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.900
Although this is all essential for a website project,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.445
I'm sure you are all keen to get some real content display in inside the browser.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:20.490
When we looked at HTML in the recent slides,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.775
we took a brief look at HTML headings.

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:29.655
Headings are used to structure the page's content from most to least important,

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:33.330
and are numbered h1 through to h6.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.265
We use h1 for the most important or the main headings,

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:41.925
h2 the slightly less important and so on.

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:44.204
h1 is also the largest,

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:47.969
down to h6 being the smallest by default.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.810
Headings are used by search engines such as

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.040
Google to determine which content is most important.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.510
In this example, the large bold HTML text at

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.090
the top here is marked up using a heading tag of h1.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.435
This makes sense as it is the main subject of the page.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:13.265
We can see this in action by visiting the Wikipedia page it was taken from.

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:19.340
If we head over to Google and then we are going to search for Wikipedia,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.740
HTML and select the top link just there.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.050
Using the Google Chrome developer tools,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.970
which we use quite a lot through this course,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.730
we can prove this is a level one heading.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.165
Inside a Chrome if we write or control click and then go down to inspect,

00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:43.175
this opens up the developer tools.

00:01:43.175 --> 00:01:46.670
Don't worry too much about what we see here just for now.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.535
We will look at this in more detail throughout the course.

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:51.620
For now though, if we go over to the inspector,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.145
which is arrow in the corner, click on this.

00:01:55.145 --> 00:02:00.185
Then if I hover over the HTML and I click that,

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:02.585
we can see inside the code here,

00:02:02.585 --> 00:02:06.235
the blue line which is highlighted is a h1.

00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:09.670
Don't worry about anything which is going on here just yet.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.310
The main thing to know is we have selected the HTML text.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.215
We can see that this is just a h1 element with a few attributes inside,

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:20.720
such as the ID, the class,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.755
and also the language which we've seen before.

00:02:23.755 --> 00:02:27.290
It's not really anything we haven't seen so far.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.590
Now let's go and give this a go ourselves.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.125
If we close developer tools and head back over to the text editor,

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:38.870
we already know that the content we want to show in

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.360
the browser is placed between the body tags.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.420
We can add our headings inside of there.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.165
It's actually on the lower section before and start to create some headings.

00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:53.830
First h1 and let's add some text inside of here,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.795
simply of heading one.

00:02:55.795 --> 00:03:02.120
On the next line let's add our h2 with the text of heading two.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:14.820
Next line h3, h4,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.940
text subheading four and two more to go.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.165
h5 for the small ones.

00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:26.930
Our heading five and then finally the last one is heading six.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.795
Type that all in, give that a save and then go over to the browser.

00:03:34.795 --> 00:03:38.975
Make sure that the index.html page is open from before.

00:03:38.975 --> 00:03:43.984
If not, go back to the file and then open up, give a reload.

00:03:43.984 --> 00:03:47.390
We can clearly see the difference between the heading sizes.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.670
But we shouldn't be tempted to use them just aside the text or make them look bolder.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.715
Remember headings are for importance.

00:03:55.715 --> 00:03:58.745
If we go back over to our finished website,

00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:00.455
which we looked at before,

00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:03.560
we have a few cases where we could use headings.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.585
We have the main site title of tech store at the top,

00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:11.045
which could be a good use case for h1.

00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:18.610
We also have the text of shop by and all items at the top of each section.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.965
These two are Level Two headings,

00:04:20.965 --> 00:04:27.835
then the sidebar heading of category and also price will be good use case for h3.

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:32.015
Let's put this into practice by applying these to our project.

00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:37.570
Let's go back over to our index.html page and inside the body,

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:44.475
let's remove h2 right through to h6 leaving h1 between the body section.

00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:48.085
This h1 like we've just seen inside the finished version,

00:04:48.085 --> 00:04:53.425
we can add a text of tech store, save that.

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:57.505
Reload the browser, and there is our site title.

00:04:57.505 --> 00:05:00.200
Back over to the finished version.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.730
Moving down the sidebar had the h2 text of shop

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.695
by and then we had the category titles of category and price.

00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:10.830
Let's add these in now.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.460
Just below the tech store title,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:22.440
let's add our h2 and in-between these times we can add the text of shop by.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.700
Staying with design bar section below which we can add our two Level Three headings.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.140
The first one was the text of category.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.900
Close that off. The text of category.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.160
Then just below that,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.930
there was also a h3,

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.550
which was for the price.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.390
I've just got a colon after shop by there.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.690
Give that a save and let's see how the sidebar is now looking. Okay, good.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.320
I just add the currency between the brackets.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.625
Add a currency symbol inside of that.

00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:06.995
Now this is the sidebar text in place.

00:06:06.995 --> 00:06:09.830
Finally, we can add all items which was for

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.860
the different section on the right-hand side here.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.245
This is also a h2 heading just like shop by.

00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:18.735
We can add this just below.

00:06:18.735 --> 00:06:23.895
Let's add h2 and a text of all items,

00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:27.525
followed by the colon. Save that.

00:06:27.525 --> 00:06:30.360
Now we see this on the page too.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.900
Things don't look too great at the moment but remember,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.575
HTML is for the content only.

00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:39.530
Things will begin to look a lot better when we dive into

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.835
CSS for styling and also laying out these texts.

00:06:43.835 --> 00:06:46.760
Next, we'll take a look at how to section or group

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.610
together related content using div tags.
