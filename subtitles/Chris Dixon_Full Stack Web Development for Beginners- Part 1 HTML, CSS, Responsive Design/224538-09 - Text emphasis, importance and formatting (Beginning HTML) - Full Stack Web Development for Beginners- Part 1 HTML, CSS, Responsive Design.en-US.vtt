00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.460
Most of the styling we add two websites is done with CSS.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.805
However, there are some small HTML elements

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:13.350
available to us which also provide some text formatting too.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.545
All we need to do is to surround some tags around the text which you want to apply to.

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:24.900
First, let's take a look at making a text bold with the p tags.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.900
Back over to our products.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.210
If we go down to the description,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.035
if we wanted to make the word awesome a little bit darker or a little bit bolder.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.835
We can wrap this.

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:39.845
First let's cut that out.

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:42.605
We can create the p tags.

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:46.205
So we can see we have an opening and a close in tag two.

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:50.425
Inside here you can paste in our word of awesome again.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:54.630
Give that save, and then reload the browser.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.780
Now we have the word awesome as a darker, bolder color.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.780
Although the p-type is valid to use,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.775
it is recommend nerds that we use a strong tags instead.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:11.620
So let's replace b, with the word strong.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.930
Save and then refresh.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.740
The text doesn't look the same,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.825
but the strong tag defines important text,

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:25.295
and is usually also displayed in bold too.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:28.760
We can also make the text italic too,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.915
which as you may guess,

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:31.670
is the I tags.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.775
So let's replace strong with I, reload.

00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:41.470
Then we have some italic text in place.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.620
Just like the B element though,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.000
the I element has been around for a long time.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.855
It's now recommended to use the M elements in place,

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:55.325
where possible as it more semantic or descriptive.

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:58.925
So instead of I, which may often see,

00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:01.445
we now usually use M,

00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:04.490
which is shall fall emphasis.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.955
Save that, and refresh,

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:11.675
and is used to give extra emphasis to the text,

00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:16.415
whereas the I element is more for a visual metallic effects,

00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:20.030
rather than highlighting any extra importance.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.430
We also have the ability to delete text with the delete element too.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.685
This represents texts which has been removed from the document by adding a line fluids.

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:39.710
So let's take a look at how this is used to meet M. Then add in DEL,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.270
which is short for delete.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.900
Save that. Let's take a look at this.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.120
Downward awesome has a deleted line fluids.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.575
We can also do the opposite too by adding text to the document.

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:57.710
So if we wanted to remove the word also,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.355
just like we've done here and replace with fantastic.

00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:05.725
We would use the insert element to insert a word.

00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:10.290
After the delete, let's include the INS,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.495
which is short for insert.

00:03:12.495 --> 00:03:16.570
Between these we can add word fantastic,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.880
Space there, Give that save.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.760
There's the deleted word of awesome and the underlined inserted Word of fantastic.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.970
Next I want to look at using a mark elements.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.390
These elements represents highlighted text.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.025
This is a similar effect,

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:40.930
what we see when we search for a word on a website.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.465
For example, let's go to the Mozilla website.

00:03:44.465 --> 00:03:48.350
This is developer dot mozilla.org.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.210
Go to any section which like inside a chrome,

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.215
gone to select command and F to open up the search.

00:03:57.215 --> 00:04:01.620
Then if we search for a word such as developers,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.105
just like that, we can see it's highlighted in yellow on the page.

00:04:08.105 --> 00:04:12.400
To add this effect, we can surround the text with Mark elements.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.615
Let's try this instead of delete.

00:04:15.615 --> 00:04:19.030
Let's add mark inside there.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.780
I can also get rid of these inserted text.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.485
We don't need that anymore. Then back over to the index page and refresh.

00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:34.460
Now as the yellow highlighting which we seen before,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.510
the final element I want to cover is small.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.850
This does pretty much what it sounds like.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.940
It makes the font size smaller.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.380
We can simply replace mark with the word small.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.520
Just like we have four over examples.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.535
This worked perfectly fine,

00:04:57.535 --> 00:05:01.065
or we can combine them both by nesting.

00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:04.055
Surrounding this small section here,

00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:06.590
we can add the mark elements too.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.250
Just before it lets add mark,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.075
and my text editor automatically complete this.

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:17.615
Go instead we want to add this at the very end.

00:05:17.615 --> 00:05:20.524
From the inside we have the word awesome,

00:05:20.524 --> 00:05:23.185
surrounding nice, we have small.

00:05:23.185 --> 00:05:27.845
In surrounding small we have mark on the very outside.

00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:31.145
Nesting is pretty simple to do.

00:05:31.145 --> 00:05:37.250
We just need to be careful to arrange the types correctly from the inside outwards.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.270
All these elements we have looked at too can also be nested.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.035
In fact, we've already messed it all these examples so far.

00:05:45.035 --> 00:05:48.970
Inside of these p elements on the very outer.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.765
Also all of these p elements and nested within this div.

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:56.990
So give them the same and let's see these both combined.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.880
Other smaller text and also the yellow highlighting in the background too.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.735
I'm now going to remove these from the project is we don't need them.

00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:12.125
Let's remove small unmarked before and also after the text.

00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:14.890
Say that and then refresh.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.085
Now we're back to normal.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:21.290
Although we don't need these elements for this particular project,

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.290
it is important to know that if you ever need them.
