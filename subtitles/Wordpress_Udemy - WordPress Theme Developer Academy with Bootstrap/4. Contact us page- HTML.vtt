WEBVTT

00:01.310 --> 00:01.950
So welcome back.

00:01.950 --> 00:06.690
In this video we're going to be creating the final page for our bootstrap template which is going to

00:06.690 --> 00:08.280
be the Contact Us page.

00:08.490 --> 00:10.010
So this is what it's gonna look like.

00:10.230 --> 00:15.600
So we've got the Contact Us section which has two six column containers.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.420
So the one on the left hand side will be for the address details.

00:19.890 --> 00:25.250
And then on the right on side will embed a Google frame with a lakeside location.

00:26.250 --> 00:32.130
And then just below up we'll add a section to send us a message and it's all spun the full width of

00:32.130 --> 00:35.040
the Web page almo we'll get to the word prosection.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.840
This will be fully functional.

00:37.290 --> 00:39.900
So let's get started in our text editor.

00:40.830 --> 00:44.830
So let's start with D about Page 1 A copy all of that.

00:45.790 --> 00:48.850
And then use this as a starting point for our new page.

00:49.580 --> 00:50.780
And then paste this in.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.750
And let's say this hour's contact don't hate them all.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.970
So this page will be used in the same footer.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.330
Someone keep all the put a section in there.

01:06.530 --> 01:11.760
For now we can keep the bolt was section book and just changes to the conductor section.

01:16.700 --> 01:19.850
And then change a section I.D. to contact.

01:22.630 --> 01:25.440
And the level two heading can be changed to contact.

01:26.950 --> 01:30.400
And I will keep this whole row consistent with the rest of the website.

01:32.490 --> 01:37.230
And the follow on role where the text can delete all the text for now we don't need that.

01:41.260 --> 01:43.140
Borgen keep the roll.

01:43.660 --> 01:45.030
I will reuse that.

01:45.610 --> 01:50.740
So what in this role this is going to be the to six column sections the one on the left will have the

01:50.740 --> 01:53.520
address and the section on the right.

01:53.710 --> 01:56.180
We'll have the Google maps I frame.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.590
So let's start by crane two new divs.

01:59.950 --> 02:04.780
We have a class of coal S M 6.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.930
I'll do exactly the same for the Google I frame.

02:11.900 --> 02:16.840
So first of all we'll start on the div on the left which will have the address information.

02:16.880 --> 02:22.850
So first of all we're going to add some custom s s so we can add our own class of address.

02:24.830 --> 02:31.520
And also take a look at the finished website you can see that the address has the dark background image

02:31.940 --> 02:34.110
and this is from a bootstrap well.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.630
So let's add the class of well.

02:38.590 --> 02:41.780
The dress is going to be the same as the footer section.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.890
So scroll down to the bottom of the page and then copy the address tigers.

02:49.230 --> 02:52.250
And paste it into the div on the left.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.350
And it's also a font awesome icon.

02:55.580 --> 02:57.970
Which is just to the left of the name.

02:57.980 --> 03:05.150
So let's add that just after the opening address tigg So to add the icon it has a tag.

03:05.230 --> 03:10.180
We had a class of F A F A dash up.

03:11.340 --> 03:12.340
Dash marker.

03:15.200 --> 03:20.040
And then just below the address we're going to add some e-mail and telephone information.

03:21.570 --> 03:25.240
So both the e-mail on the telephone section as a font.

03:25.260 --> 03:26.430
Awesome icon.

03:26.870 --> 03:30.200
So the first one is for me.

03:30.240 --> 03:34.960
IMO this is a class of F A F A envelope.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.410
DASH Oh.

03:40.790 --> 03:44.700
And then just after the Icom going add the text of email.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.020
I can put a generic e-mail in there.

03:49.150 --> 03:50.690
The mail mail dot com.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.120
Then at a break tigg.

03:54.540 --> 03:55.940
And the second icon.

03:57.840 --> 03:58.830
It's for the telephone.

03:58.830 --> 04:02.680
So this is a class of F A F A dash phone.

04:05.910 --> 04:07.250
Text or telephone.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.800
And again or put a generic number in there.

04:14.720 --> 04:15.640
Let's take a look at that.

04:15.660 --> 04:18.540
Go back into the browser and refresh.

04:21.730 --> 04:21.990
OK.

04:22.030 --> 04:25.540
So we've got the div on the left hand side sure nicely.

04:25.540 --> 04:27.770
Just something to change in the email section.

04:27.890 --> 04:29.680
Go back up.

04:30.860 --> 04:34.710
So just got a few things need to change or change that to a colon.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.700
At symbol.

04:42.180 --> 04:42.810
There we go.

04:42.990 --> 04:46.790
So next we need to create the frame on the right side.

04:47.010 --> 04:51.450
So go over to Google Maps and find a nice Lakeside location.

04:51.690 --> 04:54.710
And then what you need to do is click on the menu.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.250
And then select share or and bed up.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.960
And select the second tab which is embed map.

05:04.750 --> 05:07.020
And then copy the link that Google provides.

05:10.420 --> 05:14.240
And then if we go into our second div we can paste this in.

05:15.610 --> 05:16.890
And let's see how this look.

05:20.650 --> 05:25.230
Will that work in fine will add some C S S in the next video for this book that's look.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.250
Okay for now.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.880
So that's this real finished.

05:28.930 --> 05:31.810
So next we'll move down and we'll add the.

05:32.820 --> 05:37.130
Send us a message section or back into the text editor.

05:38.520 --> 05:45.040
And if we locate the div with the class of row and facilities we don't need the facilities class anymore

05:45.300 --> 05:47.700
but all other where on class of message area.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.550
And then all the content between this role.

05:52.630 --> 05:53.750
Can get rid off.

05:53.890 --> 05:56.330
So look for the claws and roll container.

05:59.940 --> 06:05.360
The all images and all the Dibbs And let's get started on the message section.

06:05.480 --> 06:13.180
So let's create a full width section so we'll give the div a class of call S and 12.

06:15.620 --> 06:22.740
And then nested inside will also added div with a class of well stands out a little bit more.

06:23.660 --> 06:27.070
And then inside the well we're going to create the hated team or form.

06:30.360 --> 06:33.220
So let's head over to the finished project and take a look.

06:33.230 --> 06:40.330
So the style allowed the text at the top of send as a message learn and some form groups with the inputs

06:40.330 --> 06:46.900
for the name email and the message text area and then add a submit button to the bomb.

06:47.000 --> 06:54.240
So start with the text at the very top so we'll add some petersburg's and then a text or send us a message.

06:58.250 --> 07:04.430
Then just below will add the first div with the class of phon group.

07:06.600 --> 07:10.970
And it is a bookstop class will be using to surround the free inputs.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.580
So the style will add an input.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.360
We had a type of text.

07:18.910 --> 07:21.030
A class of form control.

07:22.790 --> 07:25.010
Which is also a bookstop class.

07:25.950 --> 07:27.360
And then a idee.

07:29.200 --> 07:29.870
Of inputs.

07:29.870 --> 07:30.440
Name.

07:32.810 --> 07:33.260
And the.

07:33.280 --> 07:38.440
Place all the text simply of name and close off.

07:38.890 --> 07:44.920
OK so next we're going to add a label on this label is going to be for these screen readers.

07:44.920 --> 07:48.820
So let's give it a class of s r only.

07:50.760 --> 07:56.780
Anslinger this label to the input inside the open in targ going out for.

07:58.770 --> 08:04.070
Then much with the input eidy of input name.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.860
Then between the label tags we can add the text to appear or name.

08:10.930 --> 08:15.010
So let's copy this form group and were uses for the email section.

08:16.170 --> 08:18.050
And and paste it in below.

08:18.050 --> 08:23.260
So in this form group we need to change the input to be input email.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.830
And the text to be IMO.

08:29.310 --> 08:34.690
And then would in the input will change the input name to be input email.

08:37.470 --> 08:39.260
On the place all the text it IMO.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.340
Then paste in the form group one more time.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.190
So this time it's going to be input message.

08:51.070 --> 08:52.950
And the name of the message.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.510
And it's the USANA input.

08:56.810 --> 09:00.360
You can just delete that and this time because it's gonna be a message.

09:00.420 --> 09:02.060
We can add a textarea.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.120
So the textarea will have the class.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.490
Or form control.

09:13.450 --> 09:17.980
The idae of input dush message.

09:19.910 --> 09:21.640
Which is the same as the label.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.640
And the place all the text.

09:28.060 --> 09:30.030
It's gonna to be equal to message.

09:33.500 --> 09:38.600
And then the last attribute is gonna to be the number of rows one to appear as default.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.980
So I'm going to set this to be free initially.

09:42.130 --> 09:44.340
Then close up the text every section.

09:49.090 --> 09:58.000
And then just after the textarea the last thing I want to add is the input for the submit plan so input.

09:58.330 --> 10:00.480
So what other type of subnet.

10:03.300 --> 10:10.820
This will have the familiar class that we've used earlier on of beaten beaten dash defaults.

10:13.540 --> 10:17.900
And this will add the same styles that we've used on the buttons in the index page.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.570
And finally the value.

10:21.590 --> 10:25.370
Which is the text on the button will be submit.

10:26.180 --> 10:27.210
And close off.

10:28.740 --> 10:30.670
I shall now add a few claws and comments.

10:33.260 --> 10:35.040
And then just above the roll.

10:35.060 --> 10:38.070
This is the closing type for the 12 column section.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.460
Then just above that.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.670
This is for the class of well.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.500
So let's save that and check this out in the browser.

10:58.310 --> 11:04.110
So there's or form at the bottom of the page so that all the hate demo we need for the Contact Us page.

11:04.160 --> 11:08.970
So join me in the next video and we'll finish off the contact page by adding a C S S.
