00:01.860 --> 00:04.780
It's so for you oh going to create the About Us page.

00:04.790 --> 00:08.380
And we've already got the template for that in the boost up design.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.860
So it's going to be pretty straightforward to make.

00:10.900 --> 00:19.350
So go into your text editor create a new page and say This page has page hyphen about.

00:20.650 --> 00:21.970
Doppie HP.

00:23.930 --> 00:27.480
Outguessed art to copy the page news template.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.170
So copy the contents and paste it into the bulk template.

00:33.380 --> 00:33.630
OK.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.750
So we don't need the sidebar of the blog section.

00:36.750 --> 00:39.460
So pretty much deletes everything on this page.

00:41.350 --> 00:47.630
So delete the changizi comment at the top for a template name to be about us.

00:50.950 --> 00:52.990
Then go to the WordPress dashboard.

00:53.110 --> 00:56.970
And then next figure out this template to the page that we created.

00:57.280 --> 01:02.720
So go to the pages and then look for the bar was page and hit at it.

01:05.630 --> 01:11.230
And then we can change the template to the bar was template and then we it at that page.

01:13.220 --> 01:13.420
OK.

01:13.490 --> 01:21.530
So now we can go over to the bookstop site and open up the folder and then open up the above was page

01:21.530 --> 01:22.880
in the text editor.

01:26.130 --> 01:34.050
So shrink that down and then drag about hate mail into the text editor and then we can copy all of the

01:34.080 --> 01:34.850
section.

01:36.810 --> 01:38.970
No copy all of the above was section.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.680
So we don't need the header.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.020
We've already got there.

01:43.700 --> 01:46.610
We don't need the feature section that's done in wordpress.

01:46.610 --> 01:52.050
So copy the above was section all the way down to the close in Section tigg.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.300
So copy it up.

02:00.100 --> 02:04.970
Then go back into the about was page and paste up between the header and footer.

02:06.490 --> 02:10.480
So next would just need to correct the image file puff's.

02:10.870 --> 02:14.910
So I'm going to copy the P HP from the index page.

02:15.670 --> 02:18.030
So just look for a image.

02:19.030 --> 02:20.920
In fact made the front page for that.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.500
So copy the HP file path.

02:28.660 --> 02:30.540
And then go to the About Us page.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.480
So we'll start from the top.

02:33.010 --> 02:39.250
We'll go with the divide image start would slow pace that in and make sure you got the forwards lush

02:39.310 --> 02:40.650
before the images folder.

02:41.950 --> 02:43.320
And then scroll down.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.510
This to all of the rest of the images.

02:55.290 --> 03:00.670
And then hit save and then head over to the ABI was page and see that's work in.

03:04.170 --> 03:06.280
So down to the bottom and need to menu.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.860
The above was section.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.870
So that all appears to be working.

03:12.140 --> 03:15.230
We all need to change the text on the featured image.

03:15.530 --> 03:21.250
And why do I need functions the same way as all the rest to find the feature text on June.

03:22.700 --> 03:28.110
Am going to allow WordPress to pull in the page all in the same way as again with the new template.

03:28.350 --> 03:34.280
So we'll have the site name of tranquil spa and then the next line is going to be the page style.

03:34.480 --> 03:43.500
So if you add this to the same LC statement so copy the page translate to copy is page template and

03:43.500 --> 03:50.670
then the brackets are put in the symbol which is a two pipes and then paste it in.

03:53.430 --> 03:57.250
But this time the page template is for the page hyphen about.

03:59.890 --> 04:02.400
So save that and then refresh the page.

04:04.850 --> 04:09.340
It's that that'll work and we've got the site title and then the page title below.

04:11.410 --> 04:13.770
So that's all finished now with the above it was Page.
