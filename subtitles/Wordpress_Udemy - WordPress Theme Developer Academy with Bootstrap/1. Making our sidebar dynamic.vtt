00:02.530 --> 00:03.600
OK welcome back.

00:03.760 --> 00:06.530
So in this video we're going to take a look at the sidebar.

00:06.700 --> 00:12.670
I'm going to make sure that it's fully functional so we can make sure that the archives module and the

00:12.700 --> 00:19.220
category section is going to be dynamic meaning that WordPress will populate the categories and the

00:19.210 --> 00:22.630
most of the year by the blog post that are available.

00:22.630 --> 00:28.520
So Bill's filtered down to Howard like them displayed so the text that in the archives and category

00:28.520 --> 00:31.710
section is just currently stutter Kate jamail.

00:31.810 --> 00:36.470
So it's just what we've pulled in from the bootstraps site and want to change it now.

00:36.580 --> 00:41.750
So Will changes in the sidebar Doc pee pee or head over to that now.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.440
And we'll start with the month of the year.

00:45.610 --> 00:48.840
So if we just delete all of the list items for now.

00:50.740 --> 00:54.040
And one replace with a word press P HP function.

00:54.190 --> 01:01.930
So open up the page p tags then inside this is going to replace it with WP underscore get underscore

01:01.990 --> 01:02.970
archives.

01:05.130 --> 01:07.890
With the brackets and the semicolon.

01:08.660 --> 01:12.810
And let's save that and head back over to the blog and refresh.

01:12.810 --> 01:16.970
And now will lose all the bootstrap months of the year which put in earlier on.

01:17.130 --> 01:20.390
And now we're just left with the word Prest generate in months.

01:20.580 --> 01:24.450
So currently I've only got posts in the month of August.

01:24.570 --> 01:31.830
So just to give a little bit more content I have an ad one more post much copied the sample text.

01:33.230 --> 01:42.000
So add one more post and one call list the September news and paste in a little better text in there.

01:43.220 --> 01:49.290
And in the news category and tigg of news and then publish that.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.310
Two.

01:53.430 --> 01:54.570
To the blog section.

01:58.580 --> 02:01.460
OK so now we've got polls from two separate months.

02:01.590 --> 02:08.150
We can see that WordPress ads easy in automatically when I do exactly the same with the Cuttery section.

02:08.720 --> 02:13.860
So much to the sidebar doppie HP and find the E category section.

02:15.740 --> 02:19.890
Would you just blow the archives and then delete the free list items.

02:19.910 --> 02:21.200
Got in there.

02:21.710 --> 02:22.480
Open up the page.

02:22.500 --> 02:22.970
P.

02:26.290 --> 02:32.280
The P P function that we use is WP underscore list categories.

02:37.620 --> 02:40.480
And say that and then refresh the blog.

02:42.020 --> 02:47.510
So now the sidebar module under the categories has got the word price categories that were being put

02:47.510 --> 02:49.820
on him as we've created the blog posts.

02:49.820 --> 02:53.450
We've got an extra category title on there which we don't want.

02:53.450 --> 02:56.970
So the way to remove that is back in the sidebar page.

02:56.970 --> 03:02.560
P and would in the WP list categories function within the brackets.

03:03.310 --> 03:06.660
Looking to move the title between the quotations.

03:07.460 --> 03:11.460
By typing in title underscore L I.

03:12.020 --> 03:13.310
Equals.

03:13.430 --> 03:15.870
Just leave the blanks or no tail appears.

03:16.310 --> 03:20.480
So save and refresh and would just left with our level 4 heading.

03:20.510 --> 03:21.900
They were put in our cells.

03:22.960 --> 03:28.090
And now WordPress has put the moms on the categories in which I can actually select these links now

03:28.490 --> 03:31.740
and this should fill a day on the blog page to show.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.120
Post only by the category of the one we select.

03:35.360 --> 03:40.850
So we selected news there and would just check out our work and by scroll and down so we just got to

03:40.850 --> 03:44.330
poster board for the category of news.

03:44.330 --> 03:49.540
So if we select September we should just get the one post we made today.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.870
And just try one moulders try the office section.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.680
And we've got the one blog post with the office category.

03:59.810 --> 04:01.280
A piece of work and fine.

04:01.550 --> 04:06.350
So if you join me in the next video will create the archived copy HP which controls the layout with

04:06.350 --> 04:07.090
this view.
