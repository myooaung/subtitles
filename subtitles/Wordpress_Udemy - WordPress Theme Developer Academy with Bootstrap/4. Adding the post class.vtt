00:01.230 --> 00:02.320
Welcome back.

00:02.360 --> 00:05.670
A were pressfield is beginning to take really good shape.

00:05.890 --> 00:13.090
And this video is all about making the blog posts even more customizable by out in the post plus function.

00:13.260 --> 00:17.960
If you want to find out more information about the post glass just head over to the Word Press Code

00:17.960 --> 00:21.810
X and search for the function of post class.

00:23.070 --> 00:29.460
Basically unopposed class while theme allows the WordPress Theme offers touch of Bessie says control

00:29.760 --> 00:31.520
over the posts.

00:31.520 --> 00:38.500
So for example the COMSEC see SS file use for the post by their idae or by their category name.

00:39.760 --> 00:45.080
So maybe have the blog with different bucker uncle us depend on the category name on the tag.

00:45.230 --> 00:51.120
So as an example I'm going to put this into our theme and allow stylin by the idae.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.320
So currently if I go into old blog.

00:54.340 --> 00:56.370
If I go into the blog section.

00:57.920 --> 01:02.530
And then if you go into the chrome developer tools right click inspect element.

01:03.760 --> 01:11.530
And if we use the magnifying glass and search for one of the blogs which has the class of blog post.

01:12.580 --> 01:18.120
And then take a look you can see that the div has a class of blog post but there's no individual I.D.

01:18.540 --> 01:21.750
So we wanted to style individual posts.

01:21.870 --> 01:28.350
We couldn't do that because all the posts have the same class so let's add an individual idae to each

01:28.350 --> 01:30.180
one of these blog posts.

01:31.470 --> 01:37.620
So should close it down for now and then if you go back over to the kodaks underneath the usage had

01:37.620 --> 01:43.870
him copy the BHB then go to the index page.

01:46.950 --> 01:53.440
And then find the div with the class of blog posts and then just delete this line and then paste in

01:53.440 --> 01:53.840
the patch.

01:53.870 --> 01:54.370
P.

01:55.140 --> 01:59.710
So this will now add a custom idae to each one of the blog posts.

01:59.850 --> 02:05.450
So we just deleted the class of blog post so let's add the bucket now.

02:08.260 --> 02:09.550
And then save that.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.950
And then for refresh the blog.

02:15.410 --> 02:19.030
Never go back into the developer tools as we did before.

02:21.670 --> 02:25.920
And then hit the magnifying glass and select the blog post.

02:26.320 --> 02:34.030
So now if you look on the right side you can see that the postal has the class of blog post but straight

02:34.030 --> 02:34.650
after it.

02:34.750 --> 02:40.290
There's now a generated eidy so we've wanted to style this individual post.

02:40.330 --> 02:45.560
We've now got a reference for the success you can use this in a similar kind of way.

02:45.640 --> 02:53.890
If you wanted to use a category name or any of the values on there and would just head over to the CSA

02:53.900 --> 03:00.160
centric this is work and okay so we've got a blog post idea of 50 there and they'll show a unique one

03:00.160 --> 03:01.120
below.

03:01.150 --> 03:06.580
This is a post of 14 and you see this 38 thirty six thirty four.

03:07.070 --> 03:09.730
So just head over to the style that ceus us.

03:11.410 --> 03:14.000
If you go to the blog section.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.090
We're going to have one style into here.

03:17.420 --> 03:22.230
So the idea of post high flown 50 which has a top one.

03:23.810 --> 03:27.510
Check it work and just give a background colour.

03:27.830 --> 03:36.680
I would send it to BBB and say that and 50 was the top one.

03:36.830 --> 03:38.040
So hit refresh.

03:39.390 --> 03:40.130
So go.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.770
So the bucker uncle is changed to grey.

03:42.970 --> 03:49.120
That's because this has a unique I.D. So therefore the Steinem will only take place for this blog post.

03:51.300 --> 03:55.480
So hope that to give you some ideas of how you can customize and style your theme.

03:56.340 --> 03:57.360
So fun to watch.

03:57.420 --> 03:59.180
And I'll see in the next video.
