00:01.280 --> 00:02.190
Everybody saw a hope.

00:02.190 --> 00:08.890
This section has give you a better understanding of pagg basics and that knowledge will come in really

00:08.890 --> 00:12.420
useful in the next section where we're going to be build in our role.

00:12.440 --> 00:17.400
Carson were press Feme and convert an existing website to Wordpress.

00:17.860 --> 00:21.480
So as you go through the next section we'll be referring to the word press.

00:21.530 --> 00:26.650
Kodaks quite regularly which you can find at the kodaks dot Wordpress.

00:26.670 --> 00:27.220
OK.

00:28.310 --> 00:31.980
So the codex is the online manual for wordpress.

00:32.180 --> 00:37.460
And it's a repository for wordpress information and documentation.

00:37.460 --> 00:41.970
It covers pretty much everything you need to know about WordPress including field developments.

00:43.090 --> 00:48.530
Plug in development and how to contribute to Wordpress and get involved yourself.

00:49.480 --> 00:53.930
We'll be using a lot in the next section to browse through function references.

00:54.130 --> 01:02.050
So for example if you want to know how to work with a particular function so such as the tags were typed

01:02.080 --> 01:03.100
in the search.

01:03.960 --> 01:07.290
And then look for the function reference which is the tags.

01:08.580 --> 01:11.800
I never can find out exactly how to use this particular function.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.890
One final aid description about the function.

01:15.360 --> 01:18.460
I will also have an example of usage.

01:18.910 --> 01:22.920
So can often just copy and paste a fortune in or theme.

01:23.960 --> 01:29.630
So this particular form includes the tags which are associated with a blog post and displays them on

01:29.630 --> 01:30.570
the screen.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.440
You can often find out more information such as the parameters which the function takes in.

01:36.950 --> 01:41.890
So for example this one takes in before after a separator.

01:43.490 --> 01:50.070
So before and after simply sets which text to display before and after the individual tag.

01:50.950 --> 01:57.400
An separator is a value such as a comma or a dush which you want to pour in between each one of the

01:57.400 --> 01:58.220
tug's.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.670
And if you don't quite find the function they look for.

02:01.980 --> 02:08.150
Scroll down answer the bottom often has a list of related tags which you can take a look at and find

02:08.150 --> 02:09.370
exactly what it wants.

02:15.210 --> 02:17.390
So it's worth bookmarking the code x hours.

02:17.400 --> 02:23.520
A great resource for learning new things about Wordpress and also for checking up on a sample usage

02:23.820 --> 02:25.640
for things such as functions.

02:26.390 --> 02:28.900
I will see more of the code x as we go for the next section.

02:29.180 --> 02:29.880
So thank you.

02:29.890 --> 02:35.480
I now will move onto the next section where will convert a existing website to Wordpress.
