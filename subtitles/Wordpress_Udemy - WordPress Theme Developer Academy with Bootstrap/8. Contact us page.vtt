00:01.270 --> 00:05.080
So this is the Contact Us page that we create in the bootstrap template.

00:05.080 --> 00:10.850
So now we're going to convert this over to Wordpress in a similar kind of way to the about as Page recreate

00:10.970 --> 00:12.170
in the last video.

00:12.490 --> 00:18.130
So it's going to be pretty straightforward to convert now to more of the hard work in Bootstrap.

00:19.530 --> 00:28.530
So as usual going to create a new page and service as Page IV and contact doppie HP.

00:29.880 --> 00:34.590
And then the news the page news template to get started.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.710
So copy all the contents.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.510
And then paste this in.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.400
And then back up to the comments.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.320
Will do the same as before but this time will changes to contact us.

00:49.140 --> 00:55.290
And say that if you go over to Wordpress and then into the dashboard.

00:56.430 --> 00:58.500
And then look for the page that we've created.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.630
So the contact does an edit.

01:02.850 --> 01:03.940
And then change its template.

01:03.940 --> 01:05.570
We're going to use to be.

01:05.580 --> 01:08.630
Contact us and an update that page.

01:11.490 --> 01:13.380
Back over to the text editor.

01:14.210 --> 01:18.380
So we're going to see all the blog section and also the sidebar.

01:19.630 --> 01:22.590
All the way down to the footer.

01:22.840 --> 01:28.990
So leaving the header and the footer in and then next need to find the Contact Us page we create and

01:28.990 --> 01:30.140
bootstrap.

01:30.220 --> 01:37.620
So go back into the trunk will be folder and drug in the contact or hate schimel into your text editor.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.940
And then will copy this section which is the contact part.

01:43.830 --> 01:46.190
So look for the Contact Us section comments.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.450
Then copy all the way down to the close and section tag.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.070
Which is just before the footer.

01:55.440 --> 02:00.470
So copy it up and then paste it in between the header and footer.

02:02.150 --> 02:03.790
Now back to the top of the page.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.290
So a couple of small changes to make on this page.

02:07.300 --> 02:11.770
First of all we've got the level 2 heading which is just static text.

02:11.860 --> 02:15.100
So the changes to be were pressed by HP.

02:16.480 --> 02:19.780
So patch P The underscore title.

02:21.720 --> 02:26.630
And then close off I use HP to pull in the page say Oh.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.480
How many fixie image file pass.

02:30.500 --> 02:37.640
So when I go back into the front page and also copy the same part that we had last time which is the

02:37.670 --> 02:38.840
p p.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.450
And again don't forget the forward slush.

02:43.920 --> 02:48.710
So back into the contact page and paste just before the divide image.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.120
Nancy was it more.

02:57.350 --> 02:58.000
Not a thing that.

02:58.010 --> 02:58.960
Okay.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.500
So let's see let's work on.

03:02.030 --> 03:03.510
So go back to the site.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.790
Then in the footer menu select the contact page.

03:13.100 --> 03:13.580
OK good.

03:13.580 --> 03:16.380
So the only thing to do is the feature tech section.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.230
So we should know how to do this by now.

03:18.230 --> 03:21.140
If you go to functions drop the HP.

03:21.800 --> 03:26.060
And we use the same blog info name and also the page style.

03:26.150 --> 03:30.920
So it's pretty simple to add we can add this to the same function.

03:31.580 --> 03:41.800
So copy is page template then paste up below when it's put the awesome line and change page about to

03:41.800 --> 03:43.410
be page contact.

03:52.100 --> 03:52.830
Oh great.

03:53.190 --> 03:56.870
So save and then refresh.

03:56.910 --> 03:59.450
So that's a contact us page now finished.

03:59.550 --> 04:02.910
