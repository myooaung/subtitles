00:00.910 --> 00:06.170
So this video was all about creating in a custom four or four page sort of four or four pages where

00:06.170 --> 00:10.960
you go when the pages and found soul essentially when you're a little bit lost on the website.

00:11.170 --> 00:17.530
So if you go to the you are all of the top bar and we type in a unrecognized page to Charles a lot of

00:17.530 --> 00:20.310
A's and then hit enter.

00:20.320 --> 00:26.530
So this is the page that I've taken to solve but the word press loop arnson the by information which

00:26.530 --> 00:32.560
is one of the backup templates but want something a little bit nicer and also maybe some options and

00:32.560 --> 00:35.150
some links to get the user back on track.

00:35.350 --> 00:43.720
So we go over to the text editor and as usual create a new page and say this page hours for all for

00:44.560 --> 00:45.660
doppie HP.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.000
And copied the page about.

00:53.900 --> 00:58.640
And we use this as a base for our four or four page so I'll paste that in and save.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.780
Change the template name at the top.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.190
When a call is four or four page.

01:08.650 --> 01:09.930
So refresh that.

01:09.940 --> 01:17.590
So now we've got the A was template been used when we've found the four or four page soul versus long

01:17.590 --> 01:20.050
list out in the featured text area.

01:20.050 --> 01:25.630
Just Other little bit of texture so the user knows that they're lost and they need to get back on track.

01:25.810 --> 01:34.720
So go to the functions doppie HP and then in the clauson Curly race after the title will add another

01:34.750 --> 01:36.120
elsea statement.

01:36.910 --> 01:40.440
But this time it's gonna be if the pages four or four.

01:43.990 --> 01:45.460
Then the braces.

01:49.920 --> 01:50.180
Okay.

01:50.220 --> 01:57.090
So if the page is the four or four page which can equinix and text you put in whatever text you want

01:57.090 --> 01:59.030
but I'm going to put woops.

02:00.490 --> 02:02.180
We're a little lost.

02:05.380 --> 02:06.980
Nancy that's work okay.

02:08.910 --> 02:12.040
So Bill or problem let's check there and see what it is.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.140
Misner semicolon off the end.

02:16.880 --> 02:17.290
OK.

02:17.450 --> 02:19.620
So now I got the text appear on there.

02:21.150 --> 02:25.020
So one way to create is one and delete the sample text.

02:25.020 --> 02:30.660
And then when a Cray for separate device which you're going to shows on links and the links are going

02:30.660 --> 02:38.760
to be archived categories recent posts or by the tags when I put these links in with the widgets in

02:38.760 --> 02:41.890
a similar kind of way to how I used on the side bar.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.240
So go to the four or four template.

02:47.090 --> 02:52.640
So instead of about us as the level to head in we're going to put some text in to say let's get back

02:52.640 --> 02:53.570
on track.

02:53.930 --> 02:58.030
So open up the P HP underscore akko.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.790
Let's off of the HP The text is going to be.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.200
Let's get back on track.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.840
With a column at the end that's a problem.

03:11.850 --> 03:13.570
First let's take a look.

03:13.570 --> 03:17.010
Arko we just need cause we've used a single quotation.

03:17.260 --> 03:20.670
We need to change the surrounding quotations to be doable.

03:23.310 --> 03:25.480
And then we get a semicolon at the end.

03:28.150 --> 03:28.560
So good.

03:28.570 --> 03:32.300
Now we've got the let's get back on track level to head in.

03:33.210 --> 03:39.390
So going can delete the sample text of the Lorem ipsum so delete the first paragraph.

03:40.900 --> 03:43.150
Then also the second paragraph.

03:45.300 --> 03:48.160
But keep the surround and roll will reuse up.

03:48.660 --> 03:51.570
So going to create four separate divs for the widgets.

03:51.570 --> 03:59.050
So add a div would a class the bootstrap class of call s n 6.

04:01.220 --> 04:02.530
And then copy this div.

04:04.490 --> 04:06.560
And paste and free more times.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.050
So they've got four sections.

04:09.970 --> 04:14.440
So we touched on widgets earlier on in the course in the sidebar section.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.950
We can also use widgets in various parts of the site.

04:18.280 --> 04:19.640
So let's add them in here.

04:20.020 --> 04:22.230
So open up the HP.

04:24.860 --> 04:28.590
And then to pull in the widget we use the underscore widget.

04:30.420 --> 04:35.370
And then in brackets we use the name of the wager that we'll want to pull in.

04:36.580 --> 04:46.580
And first of all to get the archives we used WP underscore widget underscore archives.

04:48.840 --> 04:56.630
And then a semicolon at the end of the the categories is exactly the same boat and set of archives.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.840
Eight categories.

05:03.190 --> 05:06.270
And then we applied a link for recent posts.

05:06.270 --> 05:07.320
So paste our own.

05:07.530 --> 05:10.250
But this time in brackets it's wpe widgets.

05:11.380 --> 05:16.330
Then recent posts are recent underscore posts.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.310
And then to get a list of the available tags.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.150
Instead of archives.

05:22.150 --> 05:23.830
It's titled.

05:29.370 --> 05:33.560
Tag underscore cloud and say that.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.310
Then refresh the browser.

05:37.010 --> 05:41.170
Okay it's a lot as though there's a problem with the recent posts.

05:44.090 --> 05:45.650
Much needs to be recent.

05:45.980 --> 05:47.740
So Remove the S off the end of there.

05:49.000 --> 05:49.570
And there we go.

05:49.570 --> 05:56.160
So now the user can now get back to a work and page by select and some of the links below.

05:56.200 --> 06:01.270
By the way if you want to use any different widgets or different links you can find these in the code

06:01.270 --> 06:03.690
x under the widget section.

06:03.820 --> 06:06.130
You don't need to use a for the schoener.

06:07.290 --> 06:12.670
So now that all work which one are a little bit stylin just make it fit in with the rest of the website.

06:12.870 --> 06:20.730
So when I put the same one pixel border with the rounded corners round each of the four sections so

06:20.760 --> 06:22.760
got to be style lot see assess.

06:24.370 --> 06:26.190
There were three or four or four section.

06:26.770 --> 06:31.960
So copy any of the comments then head right down to the bottom.

06:35.990 --> 06:39.190
And when I make the comment to be these four or four page.

06:40.630 --> 06:43.120
So the widgets got a class of widgets.

06:46.600 --> 06:52.910
And keep the styling consistent we're gonna use the same styles as we used for the sidebar or the sidebar

06:52.910 --> 06:53.990
modules.

06:54.600 --> 07:01.720
So if you go off to the side bar section look for the sidebar modules class and then copy all these.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.410
And then paces back in.

07:08.530 --> 07:13.690
Insert a widget section so say that and take a look.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.320
So when you.

07:15.340 --> 07:21.670
Now that looks a lot better and it just looks a little bit odd with the box he's been on even heights.

07:21.760 --> 07:29.660
So just to make that look a little bit better when I add a minimum height of three hundred pixels and

07:29.680 --> 07:35.320
then refresher and I'll make sure that the sections with not much content takeable a little bit more

07:35.320 --> 07:36.000
height.

07:37.070 --> 07:40.190
So funk's are watchin And that's the end of all four or four page.
