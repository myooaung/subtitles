00:10.290 --> 00:13.040
So to get some content for the blog posts.

00:13.040 --> 00:17.800
Well over to Google and search for some lorem ipsum.

00:30.450 --> 00:34.560
So click generate and then copy the five paragraphs.

00:38.440 --> 00:46.320
Then head back into the WordPress dashboard and then once you get to the dashboard click on the posts.

01:05.190 --> 01:09.330
And then in the text box paste in the lorem ipsum.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.900
So a very great the news Unni offers category.

01:14.060 --> 01:18.560
Just simply select a new category and type in a category of your choice.

01:18.770 --> 01:26.390
So CHA's promotions hit enter and then get the new Cuttery period on there.

01:26.390 --> 01:32.700
Just blow the car griz's also the aeris for tags so you may want to add a few tags as well.

01:36.710 --> 01:37.620
Sort of type in.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.940
Hit enter.

01:40.780 --> 01:43.430
Some are going to create beauty.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.330
Hair make up.

01:46.270 --> 01:47.520
That'll do for now.

01:47.530 --> 01:49.110
So click on publish.

01:52.900 --> 01:56.640
I'm new at the top and I'm going to make 5 new blog posts in tow.

01:56.660 --> 01:58.900
So I've got plenty of content to work with.

01:59.240 --> 02:02.030
So you can either create your own or follow along with me.

02:02.180 --> 02:05.240
So the next one is going to be August offer.

02:07.700 --> 02:12.380
Then paste in the sample text on the offers category.

02:14.370 --> 02:15.790
On add some tags.

02:16.980 --> 02:18.260
And then click publish.

02:20.910 --> 02:22.350
And the third one.

02:24.620 --> 02:27.330
It's can be august news.

02:27.740 --> 02:34.260
Our news letter with a new section on the tags can be news.

02:35.950 --> 02:38.010
And updates.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.430
And paste in the content and then hit publish.

02:43.310 --> 02:45.580
It's an make two more to add a new.

02:47.690 --> 02:49.450
And then sample post.

02:51.850 --> 02:56.110
They start in and is can be uncategorized and publish.

02:58.140 --> 02:59.030
No more more.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.360
Some will post too.

03:07.910 --> 03:08.870
Published up.

03:11.110 --> 03:15.220
So I've got five post I want also got plenty of content to work with.

03:15.500 --> 03:19.010
So on the home page we've only got the link back to the home page.

03:19.010 --> 03:21.390
Next me to create the blog page.

03:21.540 --> 03:31.620
So Buck into the dashboard and go to pages and add new and call this the blog page and then hit publish.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.610
And when it's there were press that this is the page for display and blog posts.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.130
So go to settings and read in.

03:41.300 --> 03:46.900
And change the Post's page to be the blog that we just created and then save changes.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.370
Just check out the site and check if the blog page has been added to the menu.

03:52.610 --> 03:54.290
Okay that's great.

03:54.290 --> 04:00.010
So next need to transfer the blog content from our bootstrap project into Wordpress.

04:00.080 --> 04:08.120
So if we just find a word bookstop fola Minds on the desktop still and then open that up and then drug

04:08.120 --> 04:11.430
the blog dot hate mail into your text editor.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.600
You can start copying some of the content over to Wordpress.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.440
So we don't need the header or the footer section.

04:18.490 --> 04:25.950
So what we need to do is scroll down to the blog section and then we need to copy all of the blog section.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.810
So copy this and then keep going all the way down.

04:32.030 --> 04:34.400
Until we find the sidebar.

04:35.050 --> 04:36.850
So as a sidebar modules.

04:39.150 --> 04:42.260
Then copy everything up until the full to section.

04:42.420 --> 04:49.450
So copy and then go into the index P P and then paste or list just underneath get header.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.230
Outside work and would is now making it work press friendly.

04:55.400 --> 05:01.920
OK so we'll start by cutting the sidebar out and put the sidebar into the sidebar doppie HP file.

05:02.290 --> 05:08.690
So if we look for the close in blog sidebar Dave and then look at the div just before that.

05:09.790 --> 05:11.780
Then copy the modules.

05:14.930 --> 05:17.200
All the way up to the number of columns.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.250
So out the content.

05:19.250 --> 05:24.990
So he should just be left with the 12 column container and then go to the sidebar Dopping HP.

05:26.820 --> 05:32.860
PACE for N and save and back into the next page and hopefully should be getting an idea of what we do

05:32.860 --> 05:33.470
in here.

05:33.720 --> 05:40.010
In the same way that we got the header and also in the same way that we put the footer back in.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.950
Well undo exactly the same.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.320
So between the sidebar div let's open up the HP tags.

05:50.860 --> 05:58.430
And then typing get on the score sidebar and the brackets on the semicolon and save that.

05:59.680 --> 06:00.790
So hope that makes sense.

06:00.790 --> 06:06.310
We've cooked the sidebar out put it on file and then added it Buckey and use an HP.

06:06.310 --> 06:14.140
So the next thing we need to do is we need to add our blog posts to the press loop that were added earlier.

06:14.170 --> 06:20.530
We all need one of the bootstrap blog posts to work with and we've currently got free so let's delete

06:20.530 --> 06:21.240
two of them.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.770
So if you locate the end of the blog post.

06:28.570 --> 06:29.600
So there's one.

06:33.980 --> 06:36.610
And there's two such lives as just weird.

06:36.620 --> 06:40.650
One blog post we don't actually need any of the content.

06:42.090 --> 06:46.100
Or any the text so you can delete that to make more space.

06:48.040 --> 06:54.630
I would just tidy up so you know what I would do in some other container the row and the number of columns.

06:54.630 --> 07:02.010
Then the block poster so as it stands this is the content of our blog post and want to make sure this

07:02.070 --> 07:03.950
is good in the WordPress loop.

07:04.050 --> 07:11.280
So every time loops through a blog post or print out the blog post title and also the date and offer

07:11.370 --> 07:12.530
and then the content.

07:12.750 --> 07:18.730
So I start surrounding this with the word press loop solver cut the open loop.

07:20.470 --> 07:25.270
And then paste it just above the date with the class of blog post.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.630
So paste that in.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.560
And then if I cut the end of the loop.

07:34.710 --> 07:39.120
And and paste this at the end of the blog so peyster in just there.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.070
So I cut out all the paragraphs of text.

07:42.140 --> 07:45.760
So when these other content back in so could be picked.

07:45.770 --> 07:52.000
Peter thanks for the content and then paste it back in just above the end of the loop.

07:54.250 --> 07:59.530
OK says the content in which to make sure our lives are all in place.

07:59.530 --> 08:06.180
So we've got the deer with the blog post and I think we're really close in tigg after the content.

08:06.500 --> 08:10.170
Yes that much of the blog post open ended.

08:10.530 --> 08:12.200
So to put a comment in there.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.790
Of blog post.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.210
I'll make some space between the end of the loop.

08:21.730 --> 08:25.660
OK it's now got the loop and some blog information in there.

08:25.660 --> 08:31.220
Let's head over to our website and see how it's look and give you a visual indication of what the loop

08:31.220 --> 08:31.990
is doing.

08:32.080 --> 08:37.960
So if you select the blog and then scroll down so we can see that this blog post to start to appear

08:38.020 --> 08:41.180
on the left and our Sidebar has been pulled back in.

08:42.170 --> 08:46.740
But one of the problems we've got so far is we create five different blog posts.

08:46.940 --> 08:51.010
But as we scroll down we'll get the same blog post over and over again.

08:51.830 --> 08:58.280
And that's because in the next page it's pulling the content which is the Lorem it's some text but all

08:58.280 --> 09:04.790
the information such as the heading The date an offer is all the static caged email.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.270
So we need to now convert it to P.

09:07.400 --> 09:11.930
So WordPress can pull in the correct information for the blog post that we created.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.380
So let's start that now.

09:13.460 --> 09:17.110
We'll start with the level 2 heading of new feature.

09:18.070 --> 09:21.210
Now would a separate it's on a different line so it's more clear.

09:21.780 --> 09:29.430
So open up the P 8 b and again I'm a copy these P HP times because will be reusing them over and over

09:29.430 --> 09:35.700
again and to get the title we type in the underscore title.

09:37.360 --> 09:41.640
And let's save that and her bike over to the blog unrefreshed.

09:43.040 --> 09:47.660
So now you can see we've got different titles and these are the titles of the five blog post that we've

09:47.660 --> 09:53.600
done before but you hover over them you can see that these titles are links and usually in a blog you'd

09:53.600 --> 09:59.720
want these to link to the full post so you can do that in were pressed by adding the Permal ink.

09:59.780 --> 10:03.610
So we're constructing this p p in a link tag.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.700
So a a Treff.

10:07.030 --> 10:08.440
It's going to be equal to.

10:10.640 --> 10:14.070
An impatient alpay HP and to make it a link.

10:14.100 --> 10:16.140
We type in the Permal link.

10:18.770 --> 10:21.250
Forget the brackets and a semicolon.

10:21.450 --> 10:23.790
We need to were WordPress way to link this too.

10:23.910 --> 10:32.550
So do this by adding the title and a title is gonna be equal to based on appear to be and then will

10:32.550 --> 10:36.720
type in the underscore title of tribute.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.080
Which put it on separate lines so it's more clear.

10:47.830 --> 10:55.540
So we need to close off the open in a tag just after the title attributes juster and then add the close

10:55.540 --> 10:58.000
in a tag after the title.

10:58.860 --> 11:00.230
So let's take a look at that.

11:00.640 --> 11:01.920
Unrefreshing the browser.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.010
So that's a good start.

11:03.030 --> 11:07.320
I will blog post an old blue which indicates it's now a link.

11:07.320 --> 11:11.870
So back into the text editor and then will do the same with the date and the offer.

11:12.180 --> 11:14.770
So start with the date paste in the pivot.

11:14.790 --> 11:15.380
P.

11:18.040 --> 11:23.260
An echo to the browser gets underscore the underscore a date.

11:26.050 --> 11:31.090
And then inside the brackets when he'd tell WordPress what format would like the date to appear.

11:31.420 --> 11:34.680
So inside the quotations passing in free parameters.

11:34.810 --> 11:41.440
So the first one is a couple f which mph P means the month and then separated by a comma.

11:41.830 --> 11:49.300
A small J is for the day of the month and then as we use in a foot section we can use the cup or Y to

11:49.300 --> 11:52.860
get the year and then next will do the offer.

11:53.320 --> 11:57.580
So we change the office name placed in a pit p.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.110
The offer is pretty straightforward.

12:00.190 --> 12:02.490
It's just the underscore offer.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.100
And then brockett and semicolon.

12:06.210 --> 12:06.830
Let's save that.

12:06.840 --> 12:07.760
Take a look.

12:12.880 --> 12:13.220
Great.

12:13.230 --> 12:19.090
Another pulls in the username which is tranquil admin and it also gives us the date which the post was

12:19.090 --> 12:20.650
created.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.400
All the same because they're all created at the same time.

12:26.870 --> 12:32.660
So while we're in the blog post section I'd like to other little bit more information to the blog just

12:32.660 --> 12:35.700
above the offer or just below the offer.

12:35.750 --> 12:42.670
I'd like to add some information which shows which category and which tug we use for all the posts.

12:42.860 --> 12:45.090
So that's pretty straightforward to do.

12:45.380 --> 12:51.380
If we just go below the offer section that would you Stonner them also go on to add some font or some

12:51.410 --> 12:53.770
icons to make these look a little bit better.

12:54.110 --> 12:57.510
So font awesome is added with the tag.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.560
The class is f a.

13:01.110 --> 13:08.770
So all other tags first so the font or Mike on four tags is f a dash tag.

13:10.220 --> 13:18.940
And then close up and then we can generate the names of the Tigers by opening the underscore Tug's.

13:21.130 --> 13:24.240
So save that check it's working okay and refresh.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.760
So a picture of the tag appearing.

13:31.950 --> 13:35.210
And then we go on to a blog post where we've added some tags.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.530
We've got news and updates.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.350
And then her stats are working correctly.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.030
And then at a break time.

13:44.340 --> 13:46.520
And we'll start in the categories.

13:47.270 --> 13:49.460
So a font awesome icon.

13:49.850 --> 13:57.000
So I class F A and it can be f a folder open.

14:01.860 --> 14:03.540
And then add some people be.

14:04.070 --> 14:07.880
So this time we use the underscore category.

14:11.550 --> 14:11.990
And safe.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.260
So let's take a look.

14:17.620 --> 14:20.570
So the fun awesome icon appear in book.

14:20.620 --> 14:23.850
We've got the names of the categories appearing below.

14:23.860 --> 14:27.130
And we want to make sure that they are in line with the folder.

14:27.370 --> 14:30.310
We also wanted them to be separate with a comma.

14:30.310 --> 14:32.470
So this is pretty straightforward to fix.

14:32.540 --> 14:39.940
If we go inside the brackets and have the quotations all we need to do is add a comma which is the separator

14:40.630 --> 14:43.940
and then a space so the space between each of the categories.

14:45.840 --> 14:49.690
And then refresh and then also we've now got them line with the font.

14:49.690 --> 14:50.640
OK Mike on.

14:54.060 --> 14:59.550
To make this look a bit more like the tug's one will dish up the word categories in front of it.

15:01.340 --> 15:08.210
So just before the category will add the page Pete I eggs and I will echo organ who's a shorter time

15:08.240 --> 15:09.300
which is an E.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.690
Would an underscore before.

15:15.540 --> 15:25.040
And then the word would go on to equal is category and then a on space just off there as well so as

15:25.050 --> 15:27.830
a space before the first cut name.

15:28.180 --> 15:29.200
So save.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.650
And then refresh.

15:32.490 --> 15:33.350
Okay that looks good.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.940
Looks a lot better than before.

15:34.940 --> 15:36.180
So hopefully that made sense.

15:36.180 --> 15:44.720
You were ads in a font or some icon and then straight after we use an HP echo to equal the word category

15:45.470 --> 15:51.020
and then straight after the word we use in the category function to print or all the categories associated

15:51.020 --> 15:52.700
with the blog post.

15:53.150 --> 15:59.240
So say that answer me you guys may noticed as you've been scroll an up and down page that these blog

15:59.240 --> 16:01.670
posts are quite long.

16:01.780 --> 16:04.970
Are normally on a blog you just have a short introduction.

16:04.970 --> 16:06.510
Maybe just a paragraph or so.

16:07.350 --> 16:13.830
And then if you click on the blog or the title you then taken to the full blog post on a separate page.

16:14.580 --> 16:17.420
Armour can do is pretty easily in Word.

16:17.520 --> 16:26.430
It's just a case of changing the content to be the excerpt so save and this should now be a shortened

16:26.430 --> 16:27.830
version of the blog posts.

16:29.210 --> 16:30.050
Just like that.

16:33.030 --> 16:37.850
So a little bit later on the course will create the template for the full blog post.

16:37.850 --> 16:39.590
Want to click on the title.
