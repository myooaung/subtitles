WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:03.880
Okay so welcome back.

00:03.990 --> 00:08.860
In this video going to be looking at the index page and when to start rearranging the header and the

00:08.970 --> 00:13.090
footer and also add in some content or functions file.

00:13.380 --> 00:13.680
Okay.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.020
So a couple of things before we get started.

00:16.020 --> 00:22.250
If you make sure that the mump which you downloaded in the last video is up and running.

00:22.440 --> 00:27.360
So if you say start servers make sure that you click on them to get them started.

00:29.390 --> 00:36.200
And then in your text editor if you open up the tranquil w.p. which is the field folder for the project

00:36.920 --> 00:39.990
and then head over to your web browser.

00:40.190 --> 00:50.890
And then if you type in the local host call on 8 8 8 8 9 faulds lush tranquil dashed w.p. and it'll

00:50.900 --> 00:57.470
will take us to the index page that we need to begin working on if we need to get back to the WordPress

00:57.500 --> 00:58.500
dashboard.

00:58.580 --> 01:03.320
We need to just forward slash admin on to the end of the you are old.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.190
And it will take us back to the dashboard.

01:07.310 --> 01:07.580
OK.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.820
So let's get started in the text editor.

01:10.820 --> 01:17.000
We created our header on the foote's Files in the last video so we can put both the header Unni footer

01:17.030 --> 01:21.780
in these files so we're going to take the header amni footer from the index page.

01:22.070 --> 01:29.750
So if we go to the index dot P P and then scroll to the top of the page we need to copy or cut all the

01:29.750 --> 01:33.360
content from the very top of the web page.

01:34.490 --> 01:35.380
All the way down.

01:37.340 --> 01:43.000
Until we get to the closing head it's aag which is just so coppula.

01:44.030 --> 01:45.760
Right to the very top.

01:45.950 --> 01:47.190
And then could that.

01:48.690 --> 01:54.340
And now the head section is going to go into it on file which is the had a p HP.

01:54.370 --> 01:56.810
So paste right in there and save.

01:58.110 --> 02:02.630
And then if we go back into the index page will do exactly the same with the footer section.

02:02.790 --> 02:08.260
So scroll down to the bottom of the page and then below the shop online section.

02:08.490 --> 02:17.760
Look for the footer comment and then cut all the content right to the very end of the index page.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.800
So could that.

02:19.790 --> 02:24.690
And then head to the foot adopt p p peyster in and safe.

02:25.950 --> 02:26.250
OK.

02:26.310 --> 02:29.220
So if I go back to the index stop HP.

02:29.370 --> 02:32.590
So what we're left with is just the main content of the web page.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.820
We've taken the header and the footer section.

02:35.820 --> 02:41.700
So because now the header and footer are in their own files we need to link those back to the index

02:41.700 --> 02:42.450
page.

02:42.450 --> 02:44.470
That's quite straightforward to do.

02:44.580 --> 02:52.320
If you go back to the very top where the heris action was going to start you can some people be so to

02:52.320 --> 02:53.770
begin P2P.

02:54.030 --> 03:02.390
First of all we need to have the file name with dippie HP extension and then to use HP in the page.

03:02.730 --> 03:07.520
We use an open angle bracket and then a question mark.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.790
And then B.

03:10.400 --> 03:18.570
So this is the open untuck and the close and tigg is the questionmark and then the close and angle bracket.

03:18.960 --> 03:19.280
Okay.

03:19.280 --> 03:26.270
And then between the opening and closing broker we use the word press get ahead a function so get underscore

03:26.270 --> 03:33.010
header because it's function we use the curlee brackets and then a semicolon at the end.

03:33.760 --> 03:39.240
And then we do exactly the same but use get footer at the very bottom of the page.

03:39.310 --> 03:43.940
So again we'll use the HP opening and closing times.

03:46.320 --> 03:50.350
And then inside the tags we were pressed get to function.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.930
The brackets and then semicolon.

03:55.840 --> 04:01.810
So effectively what we've created is a header underfoot a template and everytime we want to reuses in

04:01.910 --> 04:08.650
wordpress rather than retighten over the same code over and over again well can just simply use the

04:08.970 --> 04:12.920
HP and use the get header or the get footer function.

04:13.940 --> 04:15.720
So and save the index page.

04:15.920 --> 04:21.800
And then next we need to go over to our functions dot P P and because all the functions are going to

04:21.800 --> 04:22.480
be mph.

04:22.490 --> 04:28.920
P We need to make sure that all the content on this page is between the organ in unclose and pay tribute

04:28.940 --> 04:29.570
Ikes.

04:30.290 --> 04:32.870
So let's start by creating a p HP function.

04:32.870 --> 04:40.250
So if we might use Patrie before it uses the function key word and a function is basically just a chunk

04:40.250 --> 04:44.020
of code which we give a name to um can call it when we need it.

04:44.390 --> 04:49.770
So to set this up use function and then the name afterwards which is tranquil.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.080
WP underscore settle.

04:55.240 --> 05:00.640
And then at the end of the function name we use the curlee brackets and then use a set of curly braces

05:01.380 --> 05:07.090
and all the information that we put between the curly braces is going to be the code which is executed

05:07.510 --> 05:10.010
when the Feme is set up.

05:10.570 --> 05:16.780
So we'll add more to this later but for now we're going to add some themes support for our assess or

05:16.840 --> 05:24.830
automatic feelings links so we do a buy out theme support.

05:27.430 --> 05:28.630
And in the quote.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.730
Type in automatic.

05:32.070 --> 05:38.100
Hafe and feed for links and then a semicolon at the end.

05:39.320 --> 05:45.660
Make sure that sir feed the sun makes you all the RSS information gets to the head section properly.

05:45.800 --> 05:50.640
Are going to add Feme support also for the title tigg.

05:50.750 --> 05:58.700
It enables both themes and plugins to access the document title so I can change it dynamically so Feme

05:59.600 --> 06:00.560
support.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.940
And of the quotes in the.

06:04.970 --> 06:09.710
This one is gonna be the title title or title high from tigg.

06:10.890 --> 06:13.550
So next need to tell WordPress to one this function.

06:13.710 --> 06:20.030
When setting up the Feme So go outside the curly braces and then only to add an action.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.330
And the brackets and then the semicolon at the end.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.460
And is he going to take in two parameters.

06:30.460 --> 06:40.600
So the first one in the quotes is after the score set up underscore Feme and then separate by a comma.

06:40.600 --> 06:49.220
We need to put the function name which is tranquil WP set up so we just copy and paste up between the

06:49.220 --> 06:50.350
E quotes.

06:51.520 --> 06:56.530
And then one more piece of p p you need to add into the functions file before move on.

06:56.570 --> 06:59.140
Is it fair go up to the very top.

07:00.690 --> 07:03.330
OK so going he's a p p if statement.

07:03.570 --> 07:06.620
So if you've not seen one of these before it's really nothing to worry about.

07:06.990 --> 07:12.370
So I'll just get started by typing now and then we'll talk over exactly what top name.

07:13.630 --> 07:19.060
So we're going to check if a condition is met and if it is we'll run the piece of code between these

07:19.060 --> 07:20.270
curly braces.

07:20.620 --> 07:29.310
So the piece of gold one to run is one to add a variable called the content whit.

07:31.120 --> 07:34.600
This is going to be set to six hundred and sixty pixels.

07:35.430 --> 07:41.200
And this value was gained control the maximum width of any piece of content which is in the Word Press

07:41.210 --> 07:48.800
Feme and we used to make sure that the user can't upload something such as a image which is far too

07:48.800 --> 07:51.980
large for the design and causes lay up problems.

07:52.650 --> 07:59.520
And then put our condition between the brackets other top so long to use the exclamation mark and then

07:59.580 --> 08:01.260
is set.

08:02.400 --> 08:08.960
And then between two more curly brackets we're going to put our variable which is the content.

08:14.010 --> 08:21.450
So this statement would normally check if this variable exists by utzon is set but because we use an

08:21.720 --> 08:25.050
exclamation mark before it check and the opposite.

08:25.290 --> 08:33.150
So if the variable content width is not set then use the variable between these curly braces and make

08:33.150 --> 08:37.470
sure the content is no bigger than 660 pixels wide.

08:38.050 --> 08:38.390
Okay.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.710
That's the functions finish for this video.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.670
Well more to this as we progress through the course.

08:43.870 --> 08:49.870
But just one more thing I want to show we before we finish this video it is now stand to pay HP to our

08:49.870 --> 08:50.610
Web site.

08:50.830 --> 08:53.650
We need to make sure that debugging is enabled.

08:54.330 --> 08:56.430
And I'll show you exactly why.

08:56.430 --> 09:00.440
If you go over to Chrome and then go to visit site.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.120
This is whole the site is looking now.

09:05.180 --> 09:07.650
It doesn't look very pretty but it is working.

09:07.760 --> 09:13.390
So if would go over to our index page and then make a type of mistake.

09:13.400 --> 09:18.710
So for example if we go to the thp at the top of the page.

09:19.690 --> 09:27.260
For example if we weren't put in the close and tigg after dippie HP and then if we refresh the browser

09:27.860 --> 09:30.320
you can see that we'll get a white screen.

09:30.340 --> 09:34.970
So because we've got a white blank screen we know that we've made a mistake somewhere but we've got

09:34.970 --> 09:38.470
no indication to show us exactly where we've gone wrong.

09:38.540 --> 09:45.650
So to give us an indication of exactly which line of code we've gone wrong on we need to go to our WordPress

09:45.650 --> 09:49.190
folder which is in the Haiti docs.

09:49.310 --> 09:50.750
So find mump.

09:51.740 --> 09:53.110
HD docs.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.640
Tranquil w.p..

09:56.240 --> 09:59.150
And then we need to go back into the config file.

09:59.870 --> 10:02.020
Where we set our database information.

10:02.180 --> 10:09.180
So just double click to open all up and then scroll down below all the password and database information.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.120
And the key is insults.

10:15.570 --> 10:17.080
Right up the bottom of the page.

10:17.190 --> 10:18.030
If you look for the.

10:18.050 --> 10:23.100
Define w.p. debug by default this is set to false.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.870
So they're going to set this to true and then save that.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.840
But don't forget to change it back to False.

10:28.860 --> 10:31.040
If you were to upload this to a web server.

10:31.350 --> 10:34.540
So save that and then refresh in Chrome.

10:34.740 --> 10:37.840
And then this will give us a a line.

10:38.820 --> 10:40.850
And it tells us exactly where we've gone wrong.

10:41.130 --> 10:44.220
So in our index page online free.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.080
Let's take a look.

10:47.550 --> 10:52.440
So we can see that the issue was online one bought but WordPress didn't discover there was an issue

10:52.770 --> 10:55.610
until it found some hate Jim ole online free.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.490
So it may not be exactly on the line.

10:58.510 --> 11:02.110
Brooke gives a good indication exactly where the problem lies.

11:02.250 --> 11:09.730
So then we can just close off that HP save and then refresh and everything should be working again.

11:10.700 --> 11:15.550
OK so that's the end of this video and we'll see in the next video will start working on the header

11:15.670 --> 11:16.530
and footer.
