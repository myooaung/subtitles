WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:06.310
So welcome but as brand new section when I'm going to the exciting part the course we're against our

00:06.310 --> 00:10.110
convert in our bootstrap template to a word pressfield.

00:10.450 --> 00:16.660
So just before we started not we need to download a web server onto our machine so to develop WordPress

00:16.660 --> 00:20.670
websites on our machine locally need to install the web server.

00:20.860 --> 00:29.140
So if you head over to mump any ampie dot info and build to install the latest version of mump And if

00:29.140 --> 00:35.500
you just click on need download button this is available for free on both Mac and Windows.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.370
So click the dung or button to get started.

00:39.310 --> 00:41.320
And then download the latest version.

00:44.020 --> 00:50.970
So up to now we've been building our website in bookstop which includes hate mail C S S and Javascript

00:51.310 --> 00:56.790
all of which run the browser so we don't need any special tools for the website to appear in the browser.

00:57.010 --> 01:04.300
But because we use one word press and WordPress is built using P P and uses my escarole database we

01:04.300 --> 01:10.570
need to install mump to create a local server on our machine and this will enable us to build WordPress

01:10.570 --> 01:11.430
websites.

01:11.440 --> 01:16.690
I'll have them live on the Internet so just pause a video for a minute while I stole a modem and will

01:16.690 --> 01:17.510
see in a minute.

01:19.390 --> 01:20.300
Okay welcome back.

01:20.300 --> 01:27.610
So hopefully you know what mump downloaded and if we just had 0 2 0 downloads and double-click on the

01:27.620 --> 01:31.350
installer they should take you through the installation process.

01:32.390 --> 01:35.200
I should be pretty simple on both Mac and Windows.

01:35.490 --> 01:38.350
OK so should get the installation script.

01:38.420 --> 01:40.080
If we just continue through.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.030
Except the licencing agreement.

01:46.230 --> 01:49.000
I'm going to install for all users on this computer.

01:50.790 --> 01:52.920
And then click install.

02:01.020 --> 02:04.960
I shouldn't take too long to install so we just give that moment to mention Stalin.

02:08.730 --> 02:12.410
There is some mump among pro has been installed successfully.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.980
Word is going to be used in the free month version.

02:15.070 --> 02:16.450
That's going to need for this course.

02:16.500 --> 02:23.210
We don't need to pay for the Pro version so once it's finished installing just click on Close.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.870
Okay so now I got mump installed.

02:28.870 --> 02:35.080
If you use a Mac if you go over to the applications it should be saved inside there.

02:36.530 --> 02:41.680
If using a Windows machine it should be stored in your usual location such as the C drive.

02:41.930 --> 02:44.030
So if you just go over to mump.

02:46.150 --> 02:49.590
Double click on the mum with the elephant icon.

02:53.230 --> 02:55.810
Then you should get a window which looks like this.

02:55.880 --> 03:03.080
So if we go into the preferences and then click the port tab the Apache ports which is the web server

03:03.350 --> 03:09.170
is using on port 8 8 8 8 and then click on the web server by default.

03:09.170 --> 03:11.800
The path for the document root should be the.

03:11.810 --> 03:13.050
Hate to docs.

03:13.110 --> 03:17.560
If it's not just click on the folder and then wanty in the folder.

03:17.570 --> 03:25.250
If you find your way to the drive where mump is installed and then if would go down to find mump and

03:25.250 --> 03:30.540
then open it up and then if you look for the hate to your docs folder and then select up.

03:31.660 --> 03:35.020
And any website which you're going to be using HP for.

03:35.070 --> 03:40.230
We need to put the project folder into the Haiti docs but will do that and just a bit.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.830
So if we start by clicking start servers.

03:45.780 --> 03:49.820
Hopefully if everything is still okay you should get the start of page.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.030
Which tells it Mum has been successfully installed.

03:54.400 --> 03:54.940
Okay great.

03:54.950 --> 03:56.900
So now mump is installed.

03:56.990 --> 04:03.850
If we head over to Google search for wordpress.

04:04.550 --> 04:08.040
And then once to search we need to go to work pressed dot org.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.840
So do you want to take a look at the WordPress home page.

04:13.840 --> 04:18.020
Feel free to do that but I'm going to click on Download word press.

04:19.460 --> 04:23.000
And then download the latest version which is currently four point free.

04:25.720 --> 04:30.130
Wordpress doesn't take long at all to install it only takes about 10 15 seconds.

04:31.410 --> 04:33.360
If you've got good Internet connection.

04:38.470 --> 04:45.260
Okay so once arts downloaded goodish get rid of that and then head over to downloads and then click

04:45.260 --> 04:48.600
on the word precede file and unzip that.

04:50.570 --> 04:54.170
So now this is our new project folder for our website.

04:54.380 --> 05:01.430
So on one rename this tranquil dash w.p. and just sort of no confusion.

05:01.430 --> 05:03.140
The original bookstop folder.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.020
When are changes to trunk will be as.

05:08.020 --> 05:10.920
And then we need to move this into a hate detox.

05:11.050 --> 05:13.410
So I'm just going to open up a new window.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.520
Find the hate detox.

05:18.570 --> 05:23.160
So if you go back into the mump folder and into detox.

05:24.370 --> 05:27.320
And then drag into Haiti docs the WordPress folder.

05:30.690 --> 05:30.920
OK.

05:30.920 --> 05:35.770
It's an old but WordPress installed in our document root of the hedgy docs.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.940
If we go back to mump then click on the open start page.

05:40.770 --> 05:43.460
This should take us back to the mump welcome screen.

05:44.520 --> 05:49.500
And then click on the tools at the top and click on page P my admen.

05:49.740 --> 05:56.250
They should take us to the admin area for creating databases so we need to create a new database for

05:56.280 --> 06:04.530
wordpress So the way we do that if we selected databases tab at the top and then on the create database

06:04.640 --> 06:06.950
and put our database name in there.

06:07.080 --> 06:10.570
So um once called mind tranquil spa.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.120
And then click on Create.

06:15.870 --> 06:20.200
And then on the left we should get the trunkless spa database appeared in the list.

06:21.210 --> 06:24.320
And then next we'll create a user for that day base.

06:24.360 --> 06:30.900
So if we go to the tabs at the top of the page and click on Privileges and then we'll select the new

06:30.900 --> 06:31.580
user.

06:32.940 --> 06:34.610
And user which is at the bottom.

06:35.380 --> 06:41.710
An arm can enter the user's information so the user name will keep as the text field.

06:41.910 --> 06:45.190
And when I call my user spa admin.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.390
And then for the host once you select local.

06:51.760 --> 06:58.000
And then you can even type in the password of your choice or you can generate a password and make sure

06:58.000 --> 07:01.180
if you generate a password that you copy it up.

07:02.410 --> 07:07.300
And when you said just in a moment and then scroll forward on the page and hit go.

07:08.930 --> 07:15.320
So there's a spa admin user created and then now we need to go back over to Wordpress and tell WordPress

07:15.320 --> 07:22.260
the database information and use information that we've just created sort of close the browser for now.

07:23.350 --> 07:25.270
And then open up your text editor.

07:31.900 --> 07:37.980
And then if you go back over to the Haiti docs and well we've saved trunkful WP folder.

07:38.270 --> 07:40.930
If you just drag that into the text editor.

07:46.450 --> 07:54.590
So to configure the WordPress database if we go into the WordPress folder and select WP config sample.

07:56.490 --> 08:01.500
Never can enter our database information so scroll down to the database name.

08:02.440 --> 08:08.850
And you can see we just need to include our database name here so delete that.

08:08.850 --> 08:17.200
And we called our database trenkle Spa so tranquil life and spa then underneath the database name we

08:17.200 --> 08:22.000
can include the user name so delete the username here.

08:22.750 --> 08:32.100
And we called our user spa admin so inspire admin or whatever name you created the password which you'd

08:32.110 --> 08:35.110
have copied to the clipboard and paste it in.

08:36.150 --> 08:39.610
We used a local host so we can just leave the horse as it is.

08:39.960 --> 08:40.960
And then next.

08:42.130 --> 08:46.510
We need to generate the keys and soltes for the off indication.

08:46.540 --> 08:50.550
So where the website link is if we just copy this.

08:53.630 --> 08:56.190
And then head over to your Web browser.

08:58.750 --> 08:59.750
And paste it in.

09:01.030 --> 09:04.100
And this should generate the keys which are unique.

09:04.180 --> 09:06.940
So select all on the page and copy.

09:09.470 --> 09:12.630
And then replace these the ones with just copied.

09:13.620 --> 09:14.880
Paste those in.

09:15.210 --> 09:21.060
And the last thing we need to do inside this file is to scroll down to the bottom of the page and we

09:21.070 --> 09:26.150
can change the database table prefix from the standard w.p..

09:26.190 --> 09:30.420
So I'm going to change mine too tranquil dbe.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.820
And this can be anything you like it doesn't really matter.

09:35.820 --> 09:36.960
So save that.

09:37.770 --> 09:41.970
And then the last thing we need to do off this file is remove the sample word.

09:42.090 --> 09:46.950
So we need to rename it WP dash config doppie HP.

09:48.490 --> 09:49.910
And make sure that saved.

09:50.010 --> 09:57.600
So if you remember when we first downloaded mump and we went inside the preferences and the pots if

09:57.600 --> 10:03.560
you remember that the port was to be eight oblate so we can use this to go into our web browser.

10:05.070 --> 10:08.490
So if you go into the web browser and then type in local host.

10:10.830 --> 10:15.660
And then akol on and then 8 8 8 8 and then enter.

10:15.900 --> 10:20.610
This should give you an index of all the Web sites which are stored inside the hastey Docs.

10:20.610 --> 10:23.450
So for now we've only got the tranquil spa.

10:23.460 --> 10:24.960
So if we click on that.

10:27.300 --> 10:32.350
And hopefully for offings when wealthy you you get the word press installation script.

10:32.670 --> 10:34.720
And it's really simple to follow along.

10:34.740 --> 10:37.550
First of all we need to select our language.

10:39.340 --> 10:43.170
So mine is English U.K. and slick continue.

10:46.110 --> 10:49.280
Now we need a little bit of information about the site.

10:49.620 --> 10:54.080
So the site title is going to be tranquil spa.

10:56.820 --> 11:02.470
Got my username saved as tranquil underscore admin and then create a password.

11:05.580 --> 11:09.300
And then mind this password is going to be different from your database.

11:09.300 --> 11:12.140
This is going to be to log into the WordPress admin.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.080
So create a strong password of your choice.

11:18.670 --> 11:20.190
An end type in an e-mail.

11:26.670 --> 11:28.670
Privacy we can uncheck this for now.

11:28.710 --> 11:34.680
We can change that later on in the settings once we have finished a website and then click install Wordpress.

11:37.120 --> 11:43.180
So goats that were press installed that are quick and easy to get were press started on your machine.

11:43.180 --> 11:47.640
So if you go to log in our bill to go to the control panel.

11:55.670 --> 12:00.300
So put username and password in and have taken to the WordPress dashboard.

12:00.370 --> 12:06.580
If you want to check out how the WordPress website is look and so far using the default theme you can

12:06.580 --> 12:09.740
just click on the tranquil spa or Mike on other top.

12:11.190 --> 12:15.390
This is our website and this is just the standard Feme which comes with wordpress.

12:15.480 --> 12:18.110
So those girls that were pressed now installed.

12:18.300 --> 12:21.650
Thanks for watching and we'll see in the next video wellstar Important.

12:21.720 --> 12:24.030
Bookstop files into Wordpress.
