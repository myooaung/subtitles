00:02.570 --> 00:03.540
Welcome back everybody.

00:03.550 --> 00:07.830
In this video going to be taken a look at how were press deals with templates.

00:08.690 --> 00:12.440
Our hierarchy system for selecting which template to use.

00:12.890 --> 00:17.150
So we head over to Google and do a search for wordpress template hierarchy.

00:17.330 --> 00:20.380
And the first link that comes up should be the one that you need.

00:20.390 --> 00:21.830
So if we select that.

00:23.560 --> 00:26.270
So we take an order to the WordPress website.

00:26.650 --> 00:32.680
And if you scroll down you can find a list of the templates that WordPress recognizes and I'll give

00:32.680 --> 00:35.310
you an idea of how WordPress uses these.

00:35.560 --> 00:40.080
So there's a visual diagram which will take a look at in just a moment.

00:40.120 --> 00:46.390
If we scroll a little bit further down the page we can find out some more details about how word press

00:46.390 --> 00:48.370
deals with templates.

00:48.370 --> 00:55.150
So by default WordPress uses the front page of the home page to display the latest blog posts.

00:55.270 --> 01:00.000
And that's really not what we want for this design in our bootstrap design.

01:00.010 --> 01:05.580
We've got a front page and then we keep old blog post separate in it on blog page.

01:06.360 --> 01:13.370
So when it's change over WordPress thing our money to use the front page doppie HP as our new home page.

01:13.380 --> 01:17.360
So when this video were taken the content of the index page.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.740
By creating the front page top HP.

01:20.810 --> 01:26.950
We'll use our index page to be the default page for display and blog posts or WordPress content.

01:27.230 --> 01:33.550
So scroll down you'll get an idea of some of the templates that were building in this course.

01:33.660 --> 01:39.410
There's a template for the single post which has the index page as a four buck template if none of these

01:39.410 --> 01:40.240
exists.

01:41.950 --> 01:44.610
Will also create a page template which were press will use.

01:44.620 --> 01:47.390
If you can't find a more specific template.

01:47.760 --> 01:54.640
And again if none of these can be found it will default back to the index page and as various of custom

01:54.640 --> 01:56.100
templates become billed.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.490
So will look at them later on in the course.

02:00.030 --> 02:02.800
And if you want take a look at the visual overview.

02:03.830 --> 02:07.920
Which gives you a nice visual diagram of how were pressed deals with templates.

02:07.950 --> 02:11.030
What template it looks for and in what particular order.

02:11.770 --> 02:15.010
So let's get started creating a new front page.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.790
So if we go back into the WordPress dashboard.

02:20.130 --> 02:21.630
And then and the dashboard on the left.

02:21.630 --> 02:23.500
If you go on two pages.

02:25.810 --> 02:27.250
I was going to delete the sample page.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.350
We don't need that.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.270
And then when I click Add new.

02:32.790 --> 02:36.980
I was simply going to call this page home and then click on publish.

02:39.130 --> 02:45.040
Then helo to the text editor and will create from page doppie HP that were looked up before.

02:45.170 --> 02:48.350
So first of all go onto the next page.

02:48.500 --> 02:58.030
Select all and copy and command and control and to create a new page and then paste it in and then save

02:58.030 --> 03:04.100
that straight away as front dush page top HP.

03:06.440 --> 03:12.550
This is now going to be our front page of the website so we can delete all of the content in the index

03:12.550 --> 03:13.360
page.

03:13.420 --> 03:19.330
Everything between the get to header they get for two hours right at the very bottom so just select

03:19.360 --> 03:20.430
all the content.

03:22.130 --> 03:24.250
Then scroll down and delete.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.420
Even just the header and footer.

03:28.690 --> 03:32.140
And would just say this page for now on will come back to this in the next video.

03:32.230 --> 03:39.000
Well start creating the word press loop to loop for all the contents of the blog posts so save.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.500
And then if you go back over to the dashboard.

03:42.510 --> 03:43.960
And then under Settings.

03:45.010 --> 03:46.770
Select the reading tab.

03:48.970 --> 03:54.810
So if we go to the front page which is up the top were mentioned at the start of this video that by

03:54.810 --> 03:59.840
default WordPress uses a front page to display the latest blog posts.

04:00.090 --> 04:05.710
Were going to change that to be a static page and when to change up to the home page and create it.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.840
So change it up and then click on so changes.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.050
So hopefully that should be all working again.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.660
So click on visit site.

04:15.810 --> 04:16.690
Refresh.

04:17.910 --> 04:19.690
And all seems to work fine.

04:19.740 --> 04:25.200
We've got a few menu links at the top so I'm just going to get rid of those now.

04:27.270 --> 04:30.040
So Buck into appearance and menus.

04:30.450 --> 04:32.410
Well kinda like the supple page.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.070
We don't need that in the menu.

04:36.570 --> 04:40.620
And also that home page link and then save the menu.

04:41.110 --> 04:43.090
Then back to our front page.

04:44.220 --> 04:48.390
Okay it's all working again and folks are watching and we'll see in the next video.
