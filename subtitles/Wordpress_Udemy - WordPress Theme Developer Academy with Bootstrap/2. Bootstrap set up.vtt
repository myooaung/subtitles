00:01.430 --> 00:06.980
Okay so welcome to the bootstraps section of this cause in this section will be built on our website

00:07.400 --> 00:13.850
use need bootstrap framework which later on in the course will use to convert to a fully responsive

00:13.880 --> 00:15.550
custom were pressfield.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.150
So to get started.

00:17.150 --> 00:22.080
Head over to get bootstrapped dot.com and hit the down a bookshop book.

00:23.710 --> 00:26.110
You've then taken to the download section.

00:26.230 --> 00:28.680
There's three different versions of bootstrap.

00:28.690 --> 00:34.380
You can download and go for the standard version on the left.

00:34.450 --> 00:36.250
So hit it on a button.

00:36.430 --> 00:42.110
So once it's downloaded if we go to the downloads and then unzip that.

00:45.900 --> 00:50.470
Because our theme is called tranquil spa and this is the bootstrap template.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.370
And don't call this tranquil.

00:53.260 --> 00:54.610
Dash w.p..

00:55.740 --> 00:58.160
No no when I say this onto the desktop.

01:06.650 --> 01:11.970
OK so you should have already downloaded the images folder which is included in this video.

01:12.320 --> 01:18.070
If you haven't go ahead and do that now and then drop that into obu Stop folder.

01:18.140 --> 01:22.430
So if we open up the bootstrap folder and take a look at what's included.

01:22.430 --> 01:28.880
So first of all we've got a successful there which includes all the bootstraps see assess both the standard

01:28.880 --> 01:31.130
version minisite files.

01:32.890 --> 01:36.950
There's also the Fonts folder which includes all legal if icons.

01:38.950 --> 01:44.860
There's our own images folder which we just put in is also a javascript folder which includes the bootstrap

01:44.860 --> 01:46.070
javascript files.

01:48.870 --> 01:52.380
So to get started if we open up the text editor.

01:54.150 --> 01:57.110
And then I'm going to drag in our project folder.

02:03.450 --> 02:08.380
There were also the bootstrap folder we just downloaded includes pretty much everything we need to get

02:08.380 --> 02:09.350
started.

02:09.370 --> 02:12.880
The only thing I need to add for now is an index page.

02:12.880 --> 02:17.910
So I'm going to press command and control and to create a new page.

02:18.220 --> 02:19.890
I'm going to say this is indexed.

02:19.900 --> 02:20.870
I hate them all.

02:22.370 --> 02:25.220
And place inside the tranquil WP folder.

02:27.540 --> 02:33.350
So once we got our index page when it's now head back over to get bootstrapped dot com.

02:34.640 --> 02:39.440
And still would in the Getting Started section would scroll down a little bit further.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.510
Until we find the basic template.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.160
Well I want to use this as a starter template.

02:49.160 --> 02:56.630
It includes all the basic nature structure and also the links to the bootstraps vss and Javascript.

02:56.930 --> 02:58.890
So I'll just hit the copy one.

03:01.630 --> 03:05.010
Back into the index page and paste it in.

03:05.860 --> 03:11.380
So now I'm just going to change the title of the web page just a tranquil spa.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.630
Let's hit the light preview button and see how things look in the browser.

03:20.460 --> 03:20.850
There we go.

03:20.850 --> 03:22.780
So it's a pretty basic template.

03:22.830 --> 03:28.480
We just got the hello world had in what it does say was a long time we'd create creating the next page.

03:29.510 --> 03:29.920
Okay.

03:29.930 --> 03:36.520
So we've mentioned the extra comes with its own success files which is great for a starting point.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.390
What we also want to make our template custom.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.830
So were also going to add a new C Ss file.

03:42.830 --> 03:47.830
So and when to create a new page and say that our custom.

03:49.060 --> 03:53.270
Dot C S S are places in the C S S folder.

03:58.450 --> 03:58.790
OK.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.700
Now let's link this in the index page.

04:01.780 --> 04:06.460
So as you can see there's already the link for the bootstrap mini final version.

04:06.550 --> 04:10.130
So if we just copy this and the comments.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.440
We can paste it just below.

04:14.550 --> 04:16.940
And we'll call this the customer success.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.880
And also change the file name.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.570
Customs process.

04:25.950 --> 04:30.440
So just one or two other things we need to link in to our Web page to get started.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.570
So the next one is the custom fonts.

04:33.750 --> 04:38.470
So we head over to Google and search for fonts.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.940
I'll take to Google dot com affords lush fonts.

04:46.230 --> 04:51.960
So once they're in there we can search on the top left the font and won't use for this web page is called

04:51.960 --> 04:53.100
meriwether.

04:55.750 --> 04:58.670
You can choose a different font if you have any preferences.

04:58.810 --> 05:01.640
But I stick with this for now.

05:01.660 --> 05:04.080
And when I select the standard meriwether.

05:04.450 --> 05:10.900
So what we need to do we need to look at the boxes on the right hand side and click on the second box

05:10.960 --> 05:12.900
in which is the quick use tab.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.560
So Google provides us with different font ways we can use.

05:18.840 --> 05:23.780
And every time we select a phone wait to download it shows us the impact on the page.

05:23.780 --> 05:25.060
Load times.

05:25.230 --> 05:29.950
So the fonts we're going to use in this project is the free hundred weight.

05:31.720 --> 05:38.200
The 400 which is the normal size and also the 700 for the bold text.

05:40.880 --> 05:46.460
And it's really easy to include into the project working just copying the link for the head section.

05:49.500 --> 05:55.070
I pasted in below our worst CFS and I'm also going to put a comment in there.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.880
Just for the custom fonts.

06:01.990 --> 06:05.290
So save that and head back over to Google fonts.

06:05.560 --> 06:12.630
And then the last thing we need to do is integrate our font into the CNS so copy the font family.

06:15.190 --> 06:17.900
And then head over to our custom access file.

06:19.250 --> 06:24.560
So the font family will go into the body section and we're going to start by adding a comment.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.210
Just for the global section.

06:31.510 --> 06:36.130
And this section will keep all the styles which we're going to be using for the site.

06:36.820 --> 06:39.010
And we'll start with the body section.

06:42.910 --> 06:44.550
So I'll paste in the font family.

06:46.220 --> 06:49.440
And while worried it will add the font weight.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.070
Love the standard form weight of 300.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.190
And also are the font size.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.090
To be 16 pixels are standard.

07:01.030 --> 07:06.160
So that's how we add the fonts to the website and then the very last thing we need to do for the set

07:06.160 --> 07:09.070
up is to go back over to Google.

07:10.340 --> 07:11.320
And search for fonts.

07:11.320 --> 07:12.050
Awesome.

07:17.420 --> 07:19.430
And then go to the gettle page for fun.

07:19.430 --> 07:20.100
Awesome.

07:23.200 --> 07:27.060
And this is going to be the concert we're going to be using for our website.

07:27.250 --> 07:33.460
If you want to check out the icons which are available just select the icons tab at the top and you

07:33.460 --> 07:39.970
can take a look at all the different ones which are available so to download these we need to go to

07:40.000 --> 07:41.010
get started.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.600
So there's a couple of easy ways to include these in our project.

07:45.660 --> 07:51.230
Were going to go with the CDMA route which simply involves copying the link.

07:55.370 --> 07:57.990
And then paste that into our head section.

08:04.390 --> 08:09.930
And this links our website to the font awesome icons which are hosted at this address.

08:09.940 --> 08:12.750
So lastly when a copy the comments.

08:14.090 --> 08:15.200
In.

08:16.290 --> 08:17.710
And then this font awesome.

08:20.490 --> 08:21.480
And then saves up.

08:22.270 --> 08:27.780
Stella go susto a bootstrap section all set up and if you join me in the next video we'll continue with

08:27.780 --> 08:29.920
the project by creating the head section.
