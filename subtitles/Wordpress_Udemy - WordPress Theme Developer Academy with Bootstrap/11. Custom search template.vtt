00:01.130 --> 00:01.840
Welcome back guys.

00:01.850 --> 00:04.990
This video is all about creating the search template.

00:05.270 --> 00:12.320
So a few videos ago when we created the sidebar widgets We also did a search box self-assertive solving

00:12.380 --> 00:16.120
in the search box such as news.

00:16.400 --> 00:20.210
You can see that it should work pretty much straight outside the box.

00:21.670 --> 00:24.520
There's nothin we're really need to do to make that work.

00:24.580 --> 00:30.580
But one thing we can do is give off Im a custom search template because at the moment its just default

00:30.580 --> 00:37.600
them back to the index page which is why weve got these pretty similar layout to the blog which is fine

00:37.600 --> 00:43.300
for an hour because we want the search page to look like the blog but will create a custom template

00:43.750 --> 00:50.170
so we can add the feature text up the top and will also show the term in the feature section that the

00:50.170 --> 00:51.510
user is searched for.

00:52.340 --> 01:00.530
And also print out a statement in case has been no search results found soul oh to the sex ed new page

01:01.640 --> 01:05.600
service as Search doppie HP.

01:08.950 --> 01:12.120
Answer It looks pretty similar to the blog page.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.780
Copy the contents of the index page to get started.

01:18.100 --> 01:24.430
And paste them in and just to check that the search template is actual work in and it all right.

01:24.430 --> 01:26.380
The index page.

01:26.380 --> 01:31.670
Just type in some random text and were and save and then refresh.

01:33.610 --> 01:38.750
And then I go so I can just see that the text to recreate it is at the top there.

01:39.180 --> 01:41.960
And this means that the template is taken effect.

01:41.970 --> 01:48.520
So in a move that now so pretty much all the work we need to do now for this template is in the functions

01:48.520 --> 01:49.460
page.

01:49.490 --> 01:54.600
Because we're gonna be working in the head dissection action to create the feature text So goal was

01:54.600 --> 01:56.690
to the functions doppie HP.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.620
And then below the four or four will add another.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.030
ELSE IF statements.

02:03.870 --> 02:05.890
Just on the curly racer.

02:06.060 --> 02:06.330
So.

02:06.330 --> 02:06.670
Else.

02:06.690 --> 02:07.540
If.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.420
Is on the score search.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.800
So up the very top of the text.

02:18.250 --> 02:29.210
We'll just do a will just do a tranquil spa official blog so copy and paste I can see that's work in.

02:31.070 --> 02:31.770
Okay.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.950
And below that will add a break tag.

02:40.580 --> 02:43.030
And a semicolon under the under.

02:43.260 --> 02:49.980
Then underneath this we're going to print out the search results or the search term that they use research

02:49.980 --> 02:50.720
for.

02:50.970 --> 02:54.620
Instead of Echo and the browser will want to use prints f.

02:55.870 --> 02:59.550
Then in the brackets we're gonna start by type in some plain text.

02:59.770 --> 03:05.390
Soul search results for a knee column.

03:06.690 --> 03:10.060
And then to show in the result of the search query use the.

03:10.080 --> 03:10.860
Percent.

03:11.780 --> 03:12.160
And the.

03:12.170 --> 03:13.600
S.

03:13.640 --> 03:21.100
N put comma after this section and then use the Get search query function to get underscore.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.270
Search on this score query.

03:25.870 --> 03:33.080
And this whole thing needs to be surrounded by brackets so one before one at the very end with the semicolon.

03:33.900 --> 03:40.410
So the reason why we are using print F instead of the Echo is because we use in form in in the search

03:40.410 --> 03:41.220
results.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.500
And Prince f I was still up.

03:43.540 --> 03:47.450
So say that and check if it's working by him refresh.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.260
I'm I can try this a few more times check it's work.

03:51.490 --> 03:56.850
So we've got the news as is current search term So let's change it to her.

03:58.710 --> 04:00.140
And that seems to work fine.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.110
I will do one more.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.030
I'll lock it in polls.

04:09.030 --> 04:16.470
That's all just check Lorem for the lorem ipsum I'm sure get lots of post for this so that it's not

04:16.460 --> 04:17.420
all work and fine.

04:18.370 --> 04:25.810
So if you notice when we search for solving the for Sir Charles hair we got the error message or saw

04:25.810 --> 04:28.040
an old posts much our criteria.

04:28.870 --> 04:34.090
I want to make this a little bit more specific to the search rather than the posts.

04:34.450 --> 04:39.920
So go over to the search dot P HP and scroll down to the bottom.

04:42.880 --> 04:50.490
Until we find the error message there so just delete that and instead will add our own custom message.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.990
Oh sorry.

04:53.200 --> 04:58.720
No much is for an end to pull in the word that the user search for.

04:58.810 --> 05:00.600
Would this add on to the end.

05:00.940 --> 05:01.730
The function of.

05:01.730 --> 05:06.580
Get a search query.

05:09.390 --> 05:17.010
No need to concatenate some more text onto their So stub I open up the quarter again and a comma.

05:19.210 --> 05:20.650
Or police search again.

05:25.750 --> 05:26.160
Let's say.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.590
Then take a look.

05:29.970 --> 05:32.620
And an error message yes I will take a look at that.

05:33.930 --> 05:36.060
That is a spelling mistake there.

05:36.130 --> 05:38.030
Where shall we get search query.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.510
So now us working we've got the error message.

05:43.620 --> 05:49.590
So sorry no matches for into space after the word for.

05:52.020 --> 05:55.910
Then refresh the hair please search again.

05:57.110 --> 05:57.930
So thanks for watching.

05:57.930 --> 06:01.090
And that's how you create a custom search page in wordpress.
