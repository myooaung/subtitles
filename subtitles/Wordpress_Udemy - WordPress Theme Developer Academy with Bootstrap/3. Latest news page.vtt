00:01.990 --> 00:02.890
Welcome back.

00:02.890 --> 00:06.130
So in this video we're going to create the latest news page.

00:06.130 --> 00:11.880
Now the latest news page is going to be pretty similar to the blog page book which you can add a Wordpress

00:11.890 --> 00:18.210
filter which will fill the current polls to display just the ones that are tied with the news category.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.750
So to get started.

00:19.750 --> 00:29.930
Head over to brocades and create a new page and service page as page kyphon News doppie HP.

00:31.990 --> 00:37.110
And then because it's going to be pretty similar to the blog page where can just copy the index page.

00:38.390 --> 00:40.340
So select all the content and copy.

00:42.190 --> 00:45.470
And and paste it in the news page and save that.

00:46.380 --> 00:51.140
And unlike the last few templates we've made this is going to be a single use template.

00:51.280 --> 00:54.470
So we're only going to link this to the latest news page.

00:54.640 --> 01:01.780
So to make sure we can link this to a Wordpress page right at the very top will add a comment which

01:01.780 --> 01:04.500
will give it a template name.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.380
So the comments at the top.

01:11.020 --> 01:13.210
Then add a template name.

01:15.970 --> 01:21.130
So this displays in the dashboard is going to be called the latest news.

01:24.590 --> 01:27.780
And say that soon I will give this a template name.

01:27.780 --> 01:32.490
If we head over to Wordpress and go to the dush board.

01:33.970 --> 01:37.140
Select the pages on the left and then go to other new.

01:38.930 --> 01:41.430
And create the latest news.

01:42.590 --> 01:49.590
And this time if we go to the page attributes on the right on side we can select a template to use.

01:49.670 --> 01:55.540
This time we can select the latest news template because we've added the template name at the top.

01:55.910 --> 01:58.130
So select latest news.

01:59.130 --> 02:00.170
And then publish.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.420
They should be automatically added to the home page.

02:05.940 --> 02:09.110
So at home the blog and now the latest news.

02:09.450 --> 02:10.920
What a spelling mistake there.

02:14.580 --> 02:18.380
Just added that Taylor to add the two onto the end and update.

02:21.900 --> 02:22.720
Okay great nugget.

02:22.790 --> 02:26.380
The home page the blog and the latest news.

02:26.390 --> 02:32.540
So now we've used the index page as a template for the latest news we need to now filter these down

02:32.870 --> 02:37.270
to only show the posts which have the category of news.

02:37.280 --> 02:40.460
So head back over to the page news doppie HP.

02:41.410 --> 02:43.490
And to add the category filter.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.730
Open up the HP.

02:48.620 --> 02:52.130
And I will use the word Press function which is Quee reposts.

02:55.010 --> 02:58.890
And we're in the brackets will tell were press which post to query.

02:58.890 --> 03:03.900
So the ones with the category name or category underscore name.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.310
Equal to news.

03:07.860 --> 03:10.300
There is some calling on the end and save.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.530
So we go back over to the website refresh.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.620
So now I'm click on the latest new section.

03:17.760 --> 03:22.980
We should just be displayed with the posts which have the category of news.

03:25.350 --> 03:26.200
Such work and finds.

03:26.210 --> 03:26.910
That's good.

03:27.090 --> 03:33.060
So you may know we need to add the text of the feature text at the top so we'll do this dynamically

03:33.090 --> 03:35.090
in the functions doppies HP.

03:35.260 --> 03:37.700
So this town will do with a little bit differently.

03:37.830 --> 03:43.710
We'll get word pressed to pull in the name of the website which should be trunkful spa and then we'll

03:43.710 --> 03:49.650
add a break tag then underneath will add the title of the page which should be latest news.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.710
So go to the functions file.

03:54.290 --> 03:58.310
We'll add another LC statement so make sure that you don't add.

03:58.310 --> 04:05.040
Else if on to the close and curly brace for the if statement go to the next one down.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.480
So else if.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.490
In brackets is page template.

04:16.080 --> 04:21.250
And the page template is going to be the page hyphen news.

04:23.970 --> 04:25.380
Stop the HP.

04:26.680 --> 04:31.470
So this one the LC stayman is checking the name of the actual template.

04:31.660 --> 04:33.240
Then the curly braces.

04:33.280 --> 04:41.730
So if it's a page template of page news will add the site name by grabbing the blog info.

04:42.920 --> 04:50.450
There in the brackets simply type in a name and that I'll pull in the name of the site and there will

04:50.480 --> 04:52.930
echo to the browser a break.

04:52.930 --> 04:55.860
So I put this on a separate line.

04:57.910 --> 05:01.180
And I will get the page title of latest news.

05:01.390 --> 05:04.650
So just type in the underscore title.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.280
And save.

05:08.290 --> 05:09.580
Um refresh.

05:11.840 --> 05:12.340
No where else.

05:12.350 --> 05:16.910
Now we've pulled in the title of the website and then the title of the page.

05:17.690 --> 05:20.070
So we would change any of these information.

05:20.090 --> 05:25.440
It would now be displayed on likely such the latest new section finished.

05:25.460 --> 05:27.880
Thanks for watching and we'll see in the next video.
