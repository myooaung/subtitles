Okay so in this video I'm just going to give you a quick overview of the mood in the Gush board and

00:07.850 --> 00:11.440
exactly what you would see in went taking a you be because.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.910
So if you're familiar would you to me Andy.

00:13.940 --> 00:15.400
Cost lay out.

00:15.410 --> 00:18.060
Feel free to skip this video and move onto the course.

00:18.780 --> 00:24.510
If this is your first udani Course I would recommend you take a few moments just to get familiar with

00:24.510 --> 00:28.170
the layout and how to navigate around the chaos.

00:28.170 --> 00:35.490
So first of all we've got a overview page would show some recent activity and recent instructor announcements.

00:36.450 --> 00:38.970
And also some information about the course.

00:40.780 --> 00:46.690
In the course content This is the area where you can go to different videos and navigate through all

00:46.690 --> 00:48.910
the sections of the course.

00:48.970 --> 00:54.650
So just click on any of these sections to expand I think see all different matches inside the section.

00:58.600 --> 01:03.270
And the Q in a tub at the top is a place to go if you need to ask a question.

01:03.340 --> 01:05.460
It's a great resource to ask a question.

01:05.470 --> 01:09.660
If you get stuck and I'm always available to answer questions.

01:09.810 --> 01:12.300
And by all means you were a student taking this course.

01:12.310 --> 01:15.300
Feel free to answer any questions you know the answer to.

01:15.490 --> 01:16.860
It would really help me out.

01:17.730 --> 01:23.400
And is also the option to follow questions and see questions without any responses.

01:24.010 --> 01:29.680
So if you do get stuck post a question and I'll do my best to answer as you go through the videos you

01:29.680 --> 01:31.630
can also bookmark sections.

01:32.500 --> 01:38.580
There's also a in halsman sub which shows all the recent announcements that the instructors made.

01:40.830 --> 01:46.640

01:47.890 --> 01:49.390
Which is the video player.

01:49.720 --> 01:54.940

02:06.690 --> 02:13.760
You can also skip forward or backward 15 seconds and even change the speed that the video plays.

02:13.800 --> 02:19.380
Also during video we can go back to the dashboard or click on the menu on the left on side.

02:19.380 --> 02:24.500
