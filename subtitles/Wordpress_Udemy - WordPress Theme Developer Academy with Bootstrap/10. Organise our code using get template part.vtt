Sir one building websites or do any kind of Colden in general.

00:05.960 --> 00:11.430
One thing you want to try and avoid is retyping the same code over and over again.

00:11.570 --> 00:18.260
So if you go into our home page we've got the facility section and we've used is a couple of times and

00:18.260 --> 00:21.360
the website now sort of reuse the same code.

00:21.410 --> 00:24.280
So we've got to own the front page.

00:24.720 --> 00:33.070
If we also go down to the above was page were reused the same section on the bottom and it's also on

00:33.070 --> 00:36.390
a four or four page it were created in the last video.

00:36.440 --> 00:41.330
So any way we can reduce the amount of lines of code not subsite and make our website a little bit more

00:41.330 --> 00:44.800
organized is to use the get template parts.

00:45.760 --> 00:50.650
And it is basically just a section of our website which you put in its own file.

00:50.650 --> 00:55.850
McCain then call it entwisle page just the same way as we do with the header and footer.

00:56.720 --> 01:00.590
So to get the code for this section when I create a new page.

01:02.140 --> 01:06.510
I'm going to call this the content hyphen facilities.

01:08.670 --> 01:09.990
Doppie HP.

01:13.860 --> 01:18.510
So let's start by going to the front page of our website.

01:19.050 --> 01:21.190
And if I look for the facility section.

01:26.670 --> 01:31.160
Which is is power here it's the div with the class or row on facilities.

01:31.260 --> 01:33.760
So look for the close and rows argh.

01:35.300 --> 01:36.960
So could this contain.

01:41.620 --> 01:47.090
So could that making sure that you still leave the container in place and they're in the firewood just

01:47.100 --> 01:48.440
created.

01:49.060 --> 01:50.280
We can paste it in.

01:52.370 --> 01:53.350
And then say that.

01:54.220 --> 02:02.220
Then go back into the front page and in the same section that would just remove this content open of

02:02.340 --> 02:04.900
the HP tags.

02:07.340 --> 02:12.360
And then we use get underscore template underscore part.

02:12.950 --> 02:16.920
And then in the brackets we use the name of the template that we just created.

02:16.940 --> 02:20.040
So which content hyphen facilities.

02:23.980 --> 02:30.740
So let's save that and head to the front page and see that work and okay.

02:30.940 --> 02:32.380
So yes that's all there.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.240
Just to show that it's pull it from the template.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.690
It would make ace but a mistake there.

02:38.110 --> 02:44.300
And then refresh you and I'll see that that's been removed as correct and save.

02:45.610 --> 02:52.080
So copied this section of P HP and we'll do the same in the four or four page and the above was page.

02:52.570 --> 02:54.810
So start with the page about.

02:55.810 --> 02:58.840
Then look for the did with the class of facilities.

03:01.080 --> 03:05.480
Then find in NE clause and wrote aag and delete this section.

03:10.130 --> 03:11.840
Then paste in the BHB.

03:14.030 --> 03:15.970
And the same with the four or four page.

03:17.690 --> 03:19.580
So as a roll facilities.

03:20.550 --> 03:21.630
Close and tigg.

03:25.930 --> 03:26.270
Lee the.

03:26.270 --> 03:29.510
And paste in the get template part.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.550
Hit save.

03:30.910 --> 03:37.110
So let's go to the website and see what's working so we know of from pages working now.

03:37.450 --> 03:40.010
So let's go to the above was page.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.470
And it's just a.

03:44.530 --> 03:48.260
Is type in a address which we all recognize.

03:48.430 --> 03:53.180
I will take it to four or four page and there's the silly section again at the bottom.

03:54.020 --> 03:57.150
So we can use this weed any section of the website that you want.

03:57.290 --> 03:59.610
Or if you create your own custom theme.

04:00.560 --> 04:06.560
If you find that you create in the same page him all over and over again just put it in its own template

04:07.190 --> 04:09.470
and pull it in we'd get template part.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.120
I read it makes it website a lot more organized.

04:12.500 --> 04:17.690
So that's it and I'll see in the next video we will create the custom template for the search page.
