00:03.490 --> 00:04.110
Welcome back.

00:04.120 --> 00:09.400
In this video we're going to add Feme support for post from nails and this will allow users wenck written

00:09.400 --> 00:15.430
a new post to also upload a featured image to make the post look a little bit nicer So it's not just

00:15.430 --> 00:16.700
plain text.

00:16.840 --> 00:23.170
So the way to do that is we need to go to all functions dot P P and then we need to aahed theme support

00:23.650 --> 00:25.580
for post from Knowles.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.580
So go to functions doppie P.

00:29.370 --> 00:36.190
And then back up to the top wood in the set up we do this in a similar way to the feeds and the title

00:36.190 --> 00:38.590
type that we added up the start.

00:38.650 --> 00:42.690
So in the set up and Feme support.

00:46.560 --> 00:51.280
And then inside the brackets we're go to put in the post for nails.

00:56.440 --> 01:01.120
And the semicolon and save that sound old included theme support.

01:01.120 --> 01:06.610
If I go over to the WordPress dashboard and then we go into the blog section.

01:08.770 --> 01:12.750
Choose one of the blog posts and then select edit post.

01:15.170 --> 01:16.850
And then scroll down to the bottom.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.560
You should see that there's now a featured image box appeared.

01:21.430 --> 01:29.630
McCain uses to set an image to attach to the post so just select that gravel upload files or can use

01:29.630 --> 01:35.960
the midi library self and almagor going to go to the select files in the upload section and then on

01:35.960 --> 01:45.330
the desktop in the boost up folder and the images have include an image called the full nailed jape.

01:45.770 --> 01:47.480
So we can use our few ones.

01:48.850 --> 01:56.010
Well you can choose one of your own and then you can put some old text or lake image and then set the

01:56.070 --> 02:05.570
featured image and then upload the update the post along with a back into the blog and just do one more.

02:08.820 --> 02:11.180
You stand on to select the second post.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.900
Then add the featured image in the same way.

02:17.610 --> 02:20.830
Stand with Dish go to the media library and use the same one.

02:20.850 --> 02:24.670
If you want and then set and update.

02:29.120 --> 02:33.010
So if you go onto the blog at the minute dont worry that you can see the image just yet.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.410
Theres a couple of little steps we need to take first.

02:36.210 --> 02:38.890
So go to the index stop his HP.

02:39.920 --> 02:44.740
And then we need to look for the exempt which is the text.

02:44.890 --> 02:48.940
So scroll down to the page Pete's eyes with the excerpt.

02:50.910 --> 02:53.280
To show the image just above the excerpt.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.370
Open up the page petersburg's.

02:57.990 --> 03:00.060
And then we set the post thumbnail.

03:05.400 --> 03:10.700
The buckets and the semicolon and save that and refresh the browser Now we should get the images appear

03:10.700 --> 03:11.580
in.

03:11.720 --> 03:12.320
So there we go.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.510
So theres the first two images that we said before.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.450
And this just makes the post look a lot better.

03:19.450 --> 03:22.200
So I can add a little bit more colour to the post.

03:23.760 --> 03:29.420
OK it's that's added to the index page but we've also got blog post appearing in the news page.

03:29.590 --> 03:32.220
And also he singled up his HP.

03:32.230 --> 03:37.250
So go over to the index page and copy the post from now.

03:38.470 --> 03:40.940
And then if you go on the single lockpick HP.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.900
And this time rather than exert its will go just above the content.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.860
And of get to save.

03:51.860 --> 03:56.480
And also in the page news this will go just above the excerpt.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.210
So paste your own and save.

04:01.390 --> 04:05.550
OK I guess I should now be aware images displayed on the post in the news.

04:05.710 --> 04:12.760
The index and also the single page if you want to change the default size of the image that displays

04:13.360 --> 04:15.180
can do that in the dashboard.

04:15.220 --> 04:19.490
So head over to the dashboard settings and then media.

04:21.210 --> 04:25.470
And you can set the default images for the for mail medium or large.

04:25.750 --> 04:31.170
And if you want to set for example the fourmile as the default image in the blog.

04:31.890 --> 04:35.330
Head over to the blog and then in the index page.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.090
Would then put inside the brackets.

04:39.360 --> 04:43.140
The form nail and then save that.

04:43.650 --> 04:48.180
And then if you refresh the block wish nugget the small mail image by default.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.580
And you can do the same for medium or large bore.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.310
I'm showing it to lead off for now.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.260
And just leave the stand that image size.

04:59.150 --> 05:01.000
So this page is nearly done just a little bit.

05:01.010 --> 05:08.600
C S S to what so I add it when I saw margin to the bottom of the image and also make the image 100 percent

05:09.110 --> 05:13.990
of the container sort of go into the style dotsie assess.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.670
And they will are this in the blog section.

05:18.770 --> 05:27.970
Take a look for the blog section and then at the bottom of this section we can reuse the blog post class.

05:30.380 --> 05:32.020
But then select the image.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.740
What's a margin onto the bottom of the image.

05:38.500 --> 05:46.440
Just 20 pixels and set the width of the image to be 100 percent.

05:48.110 --> 05:50.730
So save then refresh the blog.

05:53.590 --> 05:59.440
That's looking a lot better and nutters now finish with the blog section so I'll see in the next video.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.760
Well add the word press menu to the footer.
