00:01.560 --> 00:01.780
OK.

00:01.830 --> 00:06.330
So in this video we're going to take a look at the famous word press loop.

00:06.330 --> 00:12.360
So if just head over to Google and then it was search for word press loop.

00:13.650 --> 00:16.300
And should be taken straight to the codex.

00:16.390 --> 00:21.770
So click on the first link which takes us to the WordPress website.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.160
Okay.

00:23.200 --> 00:31.480
So the loop is P HP code used by WordPress to display posts using the loop were press processes each

00:31.480 --> 00:38.520
post to be displayed on the current page of formats according to how it matches specify criteria within

00:38.560 --> 00:45.430
the loop Tiger's el-hage Jamal appear AP HP cold in the loop will be processed on each post.

00:45.790 --> 00:52.870
So basically what that means is rather than what we'd done in old bootstrap blog template where we create

00:52.870 --> 01:00.100
free separate blog posts to save repeat repeating this cold over and over again we just create one sample

01:00.100 --> 01:07.780
blog post wood in the loop and WordPress will keep Lupron from arm pull in all the contents of the blog

01:07.780 --> 01:11.560
posts until it's no more posts to display.

01:11.890 --> 01:13.740
So scroll down.

01:14.440 --> 01:19.610
Okay so to start using the word press loop when it's copied the orpen in loop tags.

01:19.750 --> 01:25.320
So if we copy where it says the loops start here copy the first line of patch B.

01:28.250 --> 01:35.940
And then between a get header and get footer paste this in and then copy the loop ending which is just

01:35.940 --> 01:36.550
below.

01:38.420 --> 01:42.550
An n paste is in leaving a little bit space in between for the content.

01:43.670 --> 01:48.440
So if you know a little bit P P This should look quite familiar if not.

01:48.530 --> 01:55.580
Basically all the top known is where press is chuckin if posted are available and while posts are available

01:55.790 --> 01:59.920
it's got to loop through the content that we're put in here very soon.

02:00.590 --> 02:07.160
And then if there's no more posts it then ends the loop and then else if there's no posts equal to the

02:07.160 --> 02:10.840
browser the words sorry no posts much your criteria.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.840
So now the loop is in place.

02:12.850 --> 02:20.240
We need to pull in the content of the current post and will do that by open up the BHB tags.

02:21.560 --> 02:25.150
Then in between these tags we pull in the content.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.050
Then the brackets and semicolon.

02:30.360 --> 02:35.030
So this'll print out the content of the posts while post available.

02:35.160 --> 02:39.790
We don't currently have any post in the WordPress website but create those in the next video.

02:40.140 --> 02:41.560
So let's save that.

02:41.970 --> 02:47.970
And while we're going to be using this as the backup or the default template for posts we also need

02:47.970 --> 02:53.470
to create a default template for pages if no more specific template exists.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.370
So let's create the page.

02:55.410 --> 02:58.290
HP will looked at the start of this video.

02:58.650 --> 03:02.260
So which would it select all the content and copy.

03:03.250 --> 03:12.200
And then make a new page and paste down and this page is going to be saved as the page doppie HP.

03:13.530 --> 03:20.110
So save that they will go because this is the default template for pages rather than posts we need to

03:20.120 --> 03:25.520
change the error message to sorry no pages much your criteria.

03:26.530 --> 03:27.350
And save that.

03:27.460 --> 03:31.250
So if you join me in the next video was site created some Wordpress blog posts.
