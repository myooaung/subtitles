00:01.350 --> 00:06.520
Okay so move north from the blog page that we finished in the last video in this video go to be queen

00:06.540 --> 00:09.980
the About Us page which is going to be pretty simple.

00:10.020 --> 00:12.800
It's going to reuse the head and the foot section.

00:12.960 --> 00:14.360
From previous videos.

00:15.440 --> 00:19.330
We won't have a pretty consistent level to head in our divine image.

00:20.110 --> 00:25.210
We were placed in some Lorem it's some text which you can change to whatever text you want.

00:25.430 --> 00:30.980
And there will also of the links which we used on the home page to various parts of the website.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.500
And then the footer section at the very bottom.

00:34.740 --> 00:43.800
So let's go over to our text editor and will copy the index page or select all and copy and then command

00:43.800 --> 00:50.090
and in control and to make a new page paste it in and save this as a bolt.

00:51.250 --> 00:56.450
Don't hate jamo again at the same level as the index page and say look.

00:57.830 --> 01:01.280
So from the bottom of the page we can keep the footer section.

01:01.350 --> 01:03.770
This is gonna be the same as the index page.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.560
You can remove the shop online section we don't need that.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.930
We can also remove the latest Office section.

01:22.810 --> 01:24.290
Keep these silly section.

01:24.310 --> 01:26.650
This is going to be our For image links.

01:28.670 --> 01:34.950
If I can keep all of the welcome section we can just reuse the will to head in the image.

01:34.950 --> 01:38.340
So let's start by renaming the welcome section.

01:38.340 --> 01:39.580
The above was section.

01:40.430 --> 01:48.600
Well make sure we change the idae of the section to about so and keep the same container row and the

01:48.630 --> 01:51.550
same number of columns and change the.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.560
Level 2 heading to about us.

01:57.810 --> 02:00.080
I'll keep the purple image.

02:00.410 --> 02:01.840
So let's see how this look.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.430
That's okay for an hour.

02:06.430 --> 02:09.920
We can solve the alignment issues in CSA soon.

02:10.090 --> 02:13.140
So next one of add a few paragraphs of text.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.300
So we go over to Google.

02:16.130 --> 02:18.210
And do a search for Lauren ipsum.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.900
Click on the first link.

02:26.690 --> 02:31.280
I can use this page to get some sample text so I'm going to generate two paragraphs.

02:37.140 --> 02:41.470
And select the first paragraph and oh and copy it up.

02:43.180 --> 02:51.670
And then after the clauson raw tigg for the level to head in there to create one more row so the div

02:51.670 --> 02:53.150
would a class of row.

02:54.950 --> 02:57.700
Then the first paragraph are create some Pete Ikes.

02:58.630 --> 03:00.460
And then paste in the paragraph.

03:02.770 --> 03:05.110
And then just below this will create in a paragraph.

03:07.340 --> 03:09.570
Head back over to the sample text.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.660
And copy the second paragraph.

03:14.900 --> 03:15.900
And paste this in.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.600
And I say check it out on the browser.

03:24.650 --> 03:25.070
Go.

03:25.100 --> 03:32.150
So next we'll head over to our custom success so to style we want to add some pun in on the very bottom

03:32.150 --> 03:37.550
of the page just to separate this section from the filter the link text is all out of place or will

03:37.550 --> 03:43.190
set the text line to be Centre and then also create a little bit margin on the top and bottom of the

03:43.220 --> 03:44.270
paragraphs.

03:44.810 --> 03:48.500
So it would head back over to our customer success.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.640
Then create a blue section.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.860
So we give this section a I.D. of about.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.740
So let's start by adding the putting on the bomb the diff.

04:12.120 --> 04:16.600
Of Fert pixels and then text the line to be Centre.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.700
Let's take a look.

04:24.130 --> 04:28.280
Okay so the text the line harz line the text into the centre of the page.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.380
It's also made chewed up.

04:29.380 --> 04:32.030
I would divide image is in the middle.

04:32.090 --> 04:33.870
Also the link text below.

04:34.810 --> 04:38.240
And is now 30 pixels of margin on the bottom of the diff.

04:40.430 --> 04:44.730
So the last thing I want to do is add some margin to the top and bottom of the text.

04:45.810 --> 04:46.740
So let's look at the.

04:46.750 --> 04:48.200
About idae.

04:48.480 --> 04:54.930
And then the petersburg's and only thing I want to do in this bit is add some margin of 30 pixels on

04:54.930 --> 04:58.690
the top and bottom and zero on the left and right.

05:00.760 --> 05:01.820
And then refresh.

05:04.450 --> 05:09.160
So that's the text separated out and the About Us page finished.

05:09.160 --> 05:10.270
So funk's a watchin.

05:10.300 --> 05:14.800
And in the next video we'll create the final page for our bootstrap template which is going to be the

05:14.800 --> 05:15.890
contact page.
