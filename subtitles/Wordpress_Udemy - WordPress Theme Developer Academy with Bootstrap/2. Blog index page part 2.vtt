00:01.010 --> 00:01.580
Welcome back.

00:01.580 --> 00:02.570
Making good progress.

00:02.570 --> 00:02.890
Weird.

00:02.900 --> 00:04.390
I will Wordpress blog.

00:04.490 --> 00:10.730
We've got WordPress pulling in the contents of all our blog posts and displaying them on the blog page.

00:10.760 --> 00:17.240
We've used the word press excerpt to shorten down the content of the post just be a couple of sentences.

00:17.360 --> 00:21.990
So now we want to add a read more button at the end of the text.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.740
This can also link to the full blog post in the same way as the title.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.180
So to other read mob.

00:28.190 --> 00:34.430
And at the very end looking at this in no index page straight after the excerpt so it is make a little

00:34.430 --> 00:37.840
bit of space there and let's create a link.

00:38.680 --> 00:47.740
And then inside the quotations paste nippi HP Tug's and this one when Echo to the browser get underscore

00:47.770 --> 00:48.800
Permal Inc.

00:50.750 --> 00:57.030
And the brockett and semicolon at the end then close off the tag and at the close and tigra.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.680
So now we've got the link.

00:58.790 --> 01:00.350
We need to add the text.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.040
So pick HP again.

01:02.420 --> 01:04.370
And we was a short uncancel underscore.

01:04.390 --> 01:11.990
He just echoed to the browser and then inside the brackets the first prometa is going to be the techs

01:11.990 --> 01:15.220
would like to display which is going to be read more.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.500
And she had free dots afterwards.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.200
And then save and see that's work and go.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.740
OK I sat at the end of each one of the blog posts.

01:27.740 --> 01:28.680
That's good.

01:28.790 --> 01:36.500
And one little change I'd like to make is I don't like the square brackets at the end of the text so

01:36.500 --> 01:39.670
I'm going to remove them and just make it into the three dots.

01:39.740 --> 01:41.170
So let's see how to do that.

01:41.480 --> 01:44.540
If we head over to the word press code x.

01:48.940 --> 01:51.130
I will look for the code x the word press.

01:52.290 --> 01:55.860
And then search out the top for the excerpt.

02:00.350 --> 02:06.170
Then click on the function reference for the excerpt so scrawled on a bit further and it'll give some

02:06.170 --> 02:08.310
information about how to use it.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.250
And some examples.

02:10.820 --> 02:16.790
But if you go a little bit further to about halfway and look for the title which is remove the free

02:16.790 --> 02:20.320
dots and square brackets using filters.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.760
So if we just simply copy the function.

02:23.830 --> 02:26.430
Now and head over to the functions doppie HP.

02:27.510 --> 02:30.420
It's pasty symbol outside the set up function.

02:30.890 --> 02:34.770
So scroll down to the bottom of the page and paste this underneath.

02:34.790 --> 02:37.000
The other action for the scripts.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.880
So at the minute we'll return in the dots on the square brackets.

02:42.910 --> 02:47.560
But we just want to delete those square brackets and save that.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.850
Or you can put in anything that you prefer.

02:50.170 --> 02:54.570
So let's see that working back over to the spa page and refresh.

02:55.660 --> 02:59.170
Good that's all working correctly the square brackets have been removed.

02:59.770 --> 03:04.510
So it just want to change the title back to be the same colour as the bootstrap website which was the

03:04.540 --> 03:05.770
dark grey.

03:05.770 --> 03:08.570
So if we just click on inspect elements.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.680
And then select it with the magnifying glass.

03:15.620 --> 03:19.840
We can see that the cluster booster bootstrap uses is blog post title.

03:21.370 --> 03:22.410
So Copy that.

03:24.850 --> 03:28.310
I want to change colour in the style dotsie assess.

03:28.520 --> 03:34.250
So let's take a look for the blog section I will paste it in just below the title section were create

03:34.250 --> 03:35.020
before.

03:36.020 --> 03:38.790
Because it's not a link will the A.

03:40.150 --> 03:45.350
And we'll set the colour to be the value of 4 9 4 6 4 6.

03:48.410 --> 03:49.300
Save that.

03:55.170 --> 03:56.060
And refresh.

03:56.950 --> 04:00.170
Snow titles now the same colour as the bootstrap website.

04:02.570 --> 04:08.150
So you may have already noticed that we're missing the fancy image which separates the blog title and

04:08.150 --> 04:15.230
the rest of the content and nuts because we've still got the dots and the slush so we can remove them

04:16.100 --> 04:18.200
and then refresh.

04:19.420 --> 04:21.570
And this puts the images back into the blog.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.240
Okay.

04:24.250 --> 04:29.900
So if we go back down to the bottom of the page you can see it is the previous are the next buttons.

04:30.780 --> 04:33.670
So we're never going to get these to work in wordpress.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.120
So go back into the next page.

04:37.940 --> 04:40.410
Take a look for the page section.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.730
Mean keep the list I am set up as they are.

04:43.980 --> 04:49.470
But we don't need these links anymore because we can put these in in a Wordpress way so we can just

04:49.470 --> 04:59.380
delete the hyperlinks of previous and next to get the next page of posts insert the page B.

05:03.330 --> 05:09.800
Then to get the next post we type in next underscore posts underscore link.

05:12.810 --> 05:18.220
And then we want the button to say all the posts so types of inside the brackets.

05:20.650 --> 05:21.280
Okay.

05:21.490 --> 05:24.050
And then we'll copy this piece of HP.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.820
And I will paste it just below between the list items.

05:28.120 --> 05:32.480
But this time instead of next posts it's changed previous.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.160
No change.

05:35.180 --> 05:38.350
All the posts to be new.

05:42.230 --> 05:43.580
And save hopefully that should work.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.970
Okay then refresh.

05:47.880 --> 05:52.110
So that causes the buttons to disappear and you may be wondering why.

05:52.200 --> 05:57.780
Well the reason is because there isn't a previous page or a next page to go to because we've only got

05:57.780 --> 05:59.640
five or six blog posts.

06:00.180 --> 06:04.240
And by default WordPress puts 10 blog posts in a page.

06:04.440 --> 06:09.230
So just test if the pages work and head back over to the dashboard.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.710
And then down the settings and reading.

06:14.120 --> 06:18.200
And then change blog page used to sure most from 10.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.910
Down to five.

06:20.390 --> 06:21.790
And then save changes.

06:22.800 --> 06:28.940
Then hopefully if all's working correctly or the Aren't at the bottom of the page in the blog.

06:30.380 --> 06:35.730
Will she now get a page because of one got five posts so I was as the all the postpone.

06:37.110 --> 06:43.180
And there's the six poster and then of course new posts we'll get the first five.

06:47.940 --> 06:52.770
So congratulations on getting this far and getting the blog post your work in.

06:52.810 --> 06:59.130
Thanks for watching and if you join me in the next video we'll create a P P L statement which will change

06:59.130 --> 07:01.400
the feature text at the top of the page.

07:01.410 --> 07:02.830
Depends on what page were on.

07:02.870 --> 07:03.640
Well see there.
