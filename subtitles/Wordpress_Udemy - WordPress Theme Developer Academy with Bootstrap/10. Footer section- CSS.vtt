00:01.840 --> 00:02.440
Welcome back.

00:02.440 --> 00:09.730
In this video we're going to be finishing off our index page by art in the CNS for the footer section.

00:09.880 --> 00:12.660
So if we head into our custom C S S.

00:13.370 --> 00:15.330
And then copy the comments.

00:17.990 --> 00:22.370
Just for the mobile style section we'll call this the.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.810
Keep in touch section.

00:28.850 --> 00:32.090
So the footer section was roughed in the foot it Ikes.

00:33.780 --> 00:40.310
And a background colour of purple so to make the tech stand out will set the colour to be white.

00:42.350 --> 00:44.800
And then change the background.

00:45.500 --> 00:50.260
The buckram call it of a purple which is 9 7 6 8 9 C.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.870
So next we need to change the divider to be the silver colour.

00:59.440 --> 01:04.060
So in the hange Jamal will change the divider from divider purple.

01:05.880 --> 01:09.060
To be divided all the Dopp the energy.

01:10.600 --> 01:16.970
And then let's create some space in between the lines for the address and also the list items.

01:16.990 --> 01:19.060
So back in the yes.

01:21.700 --> 01:28.710
We can do our by select in the footer list items and also the address section.

01:30.730 --> 01:33.160
And let's increase the line height to be two.

01:33.170 --> 01:33.860
Ms.

01:37.370 --> 01:40.730
And that gives us a bit more space in vertically.

01:40.730 --> 01:46.430
The social media icons are a little bit bunched up so and when I add some margin on the right side just

01:46.430 --> 01:47.710
to separate them out a bit.

01:48.810 --> 01:51.540
I just looked for an awesome ikons with the I.

01:53.140 --> 01:57.360
So let's add some margin on the right side.

01:58.550 --> 02:00.380
All 15 pixels.

02:02.510 --> 02:03.510
That looks a lot better.

02:05.010 --> 02:10.740
And then we want to change the buckram kalar for the copyright section at the bottom and align the text

02:10.740 --> 02:12.410
in the centre.

02:12.540 --> 02:17.300
So for the copyright section we'll give that an idea of copy.

02:20.360 --> 02:24.870
So let's start by certainly text the line to be Centre.

02:26.630 --> 02:28.500
Buck runkel little bit white.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.890
I will set the font colour.

02:35.740 --> 02:38.490
To be foreknown 4 6 4 6.

02:39.740 --> 02:43.390
And the height of the div to be 60 pixels.

02:44.690 --> 02:47.660
And also set the line height to be 60 pixels.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.930
To put it in the text.

02:50.740 --> 02:53.900
And then finally we'll add some margins to the top of the div.

02:56.850 --> 02:58.330
Of 30 pixels.

03:01.080 --> 03:01.900
Refresh.

03:02.890 --> 03:03.210
OK.

03:03.250 --> 03:06.250
And seem to work and sort of see what the problem is.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.590
Sort of got the idea of copy.

03:12.440 --> 03:19.440
I wanted to change the spelling mistake back to I.D. and save the refresh.

03:21.450 --> 03:21.720
Okay.

03:21.730 --> 03:22.490
That's a look back.

03:22.510 --> 03:26.880
We've now got a separate AIDS copyright section at the very bottom of the page.

03:26.950 --> 03:30.160
So next we need to do some work with the list items.

03:30.160 --> 03:35.490
So we need to change the colour and also remove the bullet from the left hand side.

03:36.010 --> 03:39.490
So we'll do this in the global section at the top.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.910
So let's add this at the end of the global section.

03:45.800 --> 03:50.620
So first to remove the bullet points will remove the list style.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.170
I'll concede that to not.

03:57.070 --> 04:02.910
Because these are links we can select the footer list item link.

04:04.690 --> 04:08.930
And change the colour of the link to be white.

04:09.670 --> 04:10.480
And then do the same.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.870
But for the hover state footer elhai a.

04:15.740 --> 04:16.870
And then hover.

04:19.070 --> 04:24.020
So the hover colour is going to be the grey colour we've used for the text.

04:24.320 --> 04:27.270
So that's 4 9 4 6 4 6.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.460
And let's take a look.

04:32.420 --> 04:33.840
That's all work and fine good.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.320
So all looks fine for the desk top you.

04:37.510 --> 04:41.620
Let's shrink it down to the mobile view and see if any changes need to be made.

04:45.510 --> 04:50.820
Yeah we've got some defaults put in on the left unsigned and we also need to align the text to be in

04:50.820 --> 04:52.200
the centre.

04:52.590 --> 04:55.670
So it will move the default in up in the global section.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.550
Let's do that just above the list items.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.910
So the U L.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.950
Let's set the podium to be zero.

05:09.180 --> 05:09.990
That looks better.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.450
And set the text line.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.430
Down in the media query.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.850
We'll do that in the footer.

05:23.810 --> 05:25.570
Text Line to be Centre.

05:30.440 --> 05:30.840
Okay.

05:30.860 --> 05:37.080
So to separate the address and the foot at an ordered list I want to add a board button.

05:37.940 --> 05:39.890
So it again will do that in the media query.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.420
So footer or not a list.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.840
And also the address tags.

05:52.170 --> 05:53.700
So bored bottom.

05:56.180 --> 05:59.850
Well so that's a one pixel and underlined to be dotted.

06:01.760 --> 06:02.730
Now let's take a look.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.400
That's fine so if we expand the browser.

06:07.820 --> 06:10.320
And everything seems to be working fine.

06:12.280 --> 06:12.510
Okay.

06:12.530 --> 06:16.090
So that's the end of our index page for our bootstrap website.

06:16.360 --> 06:22.340
We'll get a few more pages to do such as the blog the contact arm ball was page.

06:22.390 --> 06:24.750
So thanks Alison and we'll see in the next video.
