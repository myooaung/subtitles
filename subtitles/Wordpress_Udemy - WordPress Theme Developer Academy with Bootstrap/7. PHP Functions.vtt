In this video take a look at how Wikinews functions mph be a function is basically a block of code.

00:11.230 --> 00:16.820
We assign a name to this block a code and call it you know program where we want to run it.

00:16.900 --> 00:21.610
It's really useful when we have the same code more than once in our program.

00:21.700 --> 00:28.480
And rather than type all the cold over and over again we can play cycle inside a function and call a

00:28.480 --> 00:30.240
function when it's required.

00:31.980 --> 00:34.790
BHP also has lots of built in functions.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.450
Our disposal.

00:36.540 --> 00:39.140
We've looked at one or two of these in the last few videos.

00:40.050 --> 00:44.930
Okay so we get started by crane function by using the function keyword.

00:46.560 --> 00:54.540
And then after that when it give the function a name followed by the parentheses or the brackets.

00:54.540 --> 01:00.510
So the name can be my function and then use the brackets after that.

01:01.610 --> 01:06.710
And then the contents of the function is within a set of curly braces.

01:08.700 --> 01:14.360
So everytime this function is called the code inside is curly braces It will be run.

01:14.400 --> 01:20.060
So for example a basic way of doing a function is just a Echo.

01:20.700 --> 01:23.260
So my first function.

01:29.480 --> 01:33.230
So it's all this function doesn't do any anything until I call it.

01:33.510 --> 01:37.740
And the way we call it is just simply by typing in the function name.

01:37.820 --> 01:42.720
So my function and then the parentheses followed by its chemical.

01:44.210 --> 01:51.070
So now when we run my function we should get the text of my first function printed to the browser.

01:52.880 --> 01:57.890
And inside the function we can even have different variables inside there.

01:58.190 --> 02:00.640
So just like we looked are a few videos ago.

02:00.950 --> 02:10.910
We can use a username so a username equal to Chris and a second variable of posts.

02:13.150 --> 02:16.860
Equal to 5 an ember can echo to a screen.

02:17.080 --> 02:27.760
Chris has five posts so Echo would in the equalizations So the username has.

02:30.270 --> 02:31.370
Five posts.

02:33.940 --> 02:36.090
So now am I call this function.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.460
Will she get the message to the screen.

02:38.640 --> 02:39.730
Would in the echo.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.470
So say that and then refresh the browser.

02:44.830 --> 02:48.840
Armour can take functions even further by passing in parameters.

02:50.230 --> 02:52.230
So let's create a new function.

02:55.290 --> 02:57.480
If wants create a function to multiply numbers

03:00.810 --> 03:07.590
and this time instead it just leaving the brackets empty which can pass in two parameters or even more.

03:08.100 --> 03:17.420
So um one uses to multiply two variables so variable number A and separate by commas variable number

03:17.420 --> 03:20.830
be.

03:20.970 --> 03:27.280
So every time this function is called Wanted to multiply the value of A with the value of b.

03:27.390 --> 03:28.480
So let's echo.

03:29.580 --> 03:30.860
Variable A.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.540
Multiply by variable B.

03:35.570 --> 03:35.890
N n.

03:35.900 --> 03:39.920
Passing the numbers we'll call the function by its name.

03:40.430 --> 03:46.330
So multiply numbers and add two numbers it want to multiply.

03:46.490 --> 03:48.340
Can pass inside these brackets.

03:49.170 --> 03:53.300
So 12 and 2 for example.

03:53.430 --> 03:55.600
So now we may call this function.

03:55.710 --> 03:59.620
We know how the value of 12 multiply by two.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.410
So we should get the value of 24 on the screen.

04:03.860 --> 04:04.660
Okay great.

04:07.000 --> 04:14.140
So what we just done is we've effectively created a variable of A and B and then needs to take up the

04:14.140 --> 04:21.130
values of 12 and two and then multiply them together and display the results to the browser.

04:21.730 --> 04:23.500
Okay so that's how you work with functions.

04:23.500 --> 04:30.280
MP HP and it's also how the can pass parameters into functions and or C in the next video.

04:30.280 --> 04:34.540
Take a look at conditional statements and more operators.
