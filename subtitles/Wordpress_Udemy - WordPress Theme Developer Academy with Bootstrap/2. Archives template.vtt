00:01.620 --> 00:02.220
Welcome back.

00:02.220 --> 00:08.940
In the last video fixed sidebar modules almost select the month of the year or the categories were press

00:08.940 --> 00:11.920
and filters down the blog posts to always selected.

00:12.760 --> 00:18.930
So when this video we're going to create the archive dump HP which is gonna be the template which controls

00:18.930 --> 00:24.010
a look of the blog when we select on any of these archives to get started.

00:24.010 --> 00:29.120
Head over to brackets are your text editor and then create a new page.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.790
And so this page hours archive.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.340
Top HP.

00:38.560 --> 00:45.490
Make sure that in the project directory on the gun use the single dot P HP as a starting point.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.150
So select all copy.

00:49.970 --> 00:55.920
And then paste this back in to a new page which is archive and save that.

00:57.510 --> 01:02.720
Back to the top of the page were going to create the comment so the comment we need is one call list.

01:02.740 --> 01:07.860
The template for displaying archive pages.

01:13.160 --> 01:13.730
Okay.

01:14.820 --> 01:16.210
And say La Soul.

01:16.230 --> 01:20.110
The page is going to look pretty much the same when I click on the archives.

01:20.220 --> 01:22.840
As one clicked on the blog post.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.460
Take a look at the full view.

01:24.660 --> 01:29.970
So we don't need to do anything in the archives template for now but we do want to go to the functions

01:29.970 --> 01:37.080
page and make sure that the text or the featured area is changed back to tranquil spa.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.890
Official blog book going to do something a little bit different this time.

01:40.950 --> 01:46.840
Go going to add a little bit more P HP which will display just underneath the text and it will show

01:46.840 --> 01:51.010
us which category you selected or which month will display in.

01:51.780 --> 01:55.610
So back into the text editor and go over to the functions stop.

01:55.810 --> 02:01.970
P Then it should be at the end of your functions page which should have the feature text function.

02:03.130 --> 02:06.410
I am going to continue this section with another LC statement.

02:06.690 --> 02:09.100
Just after the last one.

02:09.100 --> 02:09.680
So type in.

02:09.690 --> 02:10.540
Else if.

02:11.910 --> 02:12.370
And then the.

02:12.390 --> 02:15.490
Condition and the curly braces.

02:16.460 --> 02:20.950
So the condition that we want to check is if the page is archive.

02:24.140 --> 02:31.700
And if it is go to echo out to the browser to start with the same text of tranquil spa official blog

02:32.270 --> 02:34.150
so I can copy and paste that.

02:35.080 --> 02:39.510
So as we mentioned before underneath the textbook in a put a new line.

02:39.860 --> 02:45.370
So this line is going to show the one for the category that would display in solds make sure it goes

02:45.370 --> 02:46.670
on the next line.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.240
I'm going to echo alt a break tigg.

02:52.180 --> 02:58.070
Make sure this goes in quotations just like that.

02:58.240 --> 03:02.560
So to start would have gone echo out the category or the tag name.

03:02.780 --> 03:04.980
And we do our By typing single.

03:06.190 --> 03:08.630
Turn title.

03:12.330 --> 03:19.680
And then the text I want to appear before the title is browsing and then a colon and a space.

03:21.560 --> 03:25.420
So let's save that and see how that look and refresh the browser.

03:25.990 --> 03:32.260
So now we've got the tranquil spa fish blog text then a break tigg and straight afterwards we've got

03:32.260 --> 03:38.890
the browsing text that we just put in and the browsing text is then followed by the category which is

03:38.890 --> 03:40.270
currently offers.

03:40.420 --> 03:44.990
So let's click on news and check that work.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.070
So now we've got the new section.

03:47.510 --> 03:48.830
I'm going to try one more.

03:49.790 --> 03:51.060
Sell promotions.

03:51.830 --> 03:52.470
Okay good sir.

03:52.490 --> 03:55.320
Now that was pretty straightforward to get that in there.

03:55.320 --> 04:00.770
Boy it's going to be a little bit more difficult to pull in the month of the post but I'll show you

04:00.770 --> 04:01.870
how to do that now.

04:03.570 --> 04:09.690
So first of all we need to put in a new video statement which checks if the Archives has been filtered

04:09.690 --> 04:11.340
by the current one.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.760
So in the buckets if is mom.

04:16.930 --> 04:21.430
And then the brackets afterwards then create the curly braces.

04:22.080 --> 04:26.710
So to get started we need to find out which month for the year it currently is and when to store it

04:26.720 --> 04:28.360
in to a variable.

04:28.360 --> 04:32.010
So the dollar sign um call is variable the month.

04:32.530 --> 04:33.090
No.

04:34.440 --> 04:43.410
And that is equal to get one the score query underscore var and then in brackets in the premises and

04:43.410 --> 04:49.800
the quotations when pull in the month number and then a semicolon of the end there.

04:50.230 --> 04:54.840
Okay so next one create two variables one for the month and one for the year.

04:55.110 --> 04:57.180
So I'll start with the month.

04:57.450 --> 05:01.540
And when I set that equal to the HP date.

05:02.870 --> 05:06.830
The first prometa are going to pass in is the form.

05:07.160 --> 05:14.330
So the form that we want to return is a couple f which returns a current month in the long form such

05:14.330 --> 05:16.490
as January or February.

05:17.240 --> 05:23.030
Then separate by a comma and then next we want to return the unique timestamp.

05:23.130 --> 05:29.940
Am I going to do that by typing in MRK time and then we need to pass in some parameters.

05:29.970 --> 05:31.740
So the first one is the hour.

05:31.980 --> 05:34.470
So we don't need to put any food in there.

05:34.470 --> 05:36.590
The second one is the minute.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.970
So we're going to roll.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.560
The third one is the second.

05:41.630 --> 05:46.460
So it's going to be zero and the fourth one is for the month.

05:46.730 --> 05:54.270
So because we've create a variable called month from looking just copy and paste that in.

05:54.980 --> 05:59.900
And that should return the kirit month and then will create the year variable.

05:59.960 --> 06:04.660
So year is gonna be equal to or do the same as the in one number.

06:04.850 --> 06:06.990
So get query VAR.

06:09.140 --> 06:16.010
This time will pass in the wood you're aren't cynical at the end.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.580
So now we'll create two variables with them one for under a year.

06:19.660 --> 06:23.190
We need to echo these to the browser so echo.

06:23.840 --> 06:29.690
First of all the text which is going to be posts from were disspain Straight after.

06:30.670 --> 06:31.740
And then the period.

06:31.860 --> 06:33.180
The variable.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.760
So the first one is going to be the month.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.150
And I will add on a space.

06:40.620 --> 06:43.350
So put the single call to one space in between.

06:43.790 --> 06:47.200
And then one add on the last variable which was the year.

06:48.780 --> 06:54.350
With a semicolon and hit save and then head over to work Press and refresh.

06:56.410 --> 06:59.450
So we'll select one of the archives and services work on.

07:00.590 --> 07:06.680
Okay looks good we've got the post strong text and then we've added on the month variable and then the

07:06.680 --> 07:08.560
variable for the year.

07:08.630 --> 07:11.630
So let's just check the August ones and see if that's working.

07:13.510 --> 07:16.000
Okay so all the piece are working correctly.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.760
We've got the polls show and from the current month we've also got the categories of the current time

07:21.780 --> 07:23.080
show 1.

07:23.170 --> 07:28.920
So now if you join me in the next video we'll continue with the website by adding the latest news page.
