00:01.420 --> 00:02.020
Welcome back.

00:02.020 --> 00:08.230
In this video I'm going to show you how to make our Sidebar more modular by Add in Word Press widgets

00:08.830 --> 00:14.170
and a side bar which is essentially just one of the blocks that we've already created.

00:14.280 --> 00:19.480
We're going to put it into Wordpress and that gives the site administrator the chance to reorganize

00:19.750 --> 00:21.460
and change things about one sidebar.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.380
If the wants.

00:22.480 --> 00:29.510
So the way to get started is if you go over to the code X. And if we look for the section on which you

00:29.620 --> 00:30.910
and themes.

00:31.270 --> 00:35.900
So it's pretty easy to get the widgets working in our theme at the minute.

00:36.250 --> 00:38.560
If we go over to the dashboard.

00:39.270 --> 00:45.870
And then if we go into the appearance the squirrelly no option for the widgets so we can change up by

00:45.930 --> 00:47.940
uddin it to all functions file.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.960
So what should we look for this action on how to register a widget area and copy the sample code.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.480
Oh to the functions not P HP.

01:01.720 --> 01:05.520
And I'm going to paste this in just before the feature text function.

01:06.220 --> 01:08.140
So paste that in there.

01:08.330 --> 01:13.720
I don't need the page petersburg's because they're already at the start and the end of the functions

01:13.720 --> 01:20.060
file so I can remove them and then it's just a case of changing some of the values.

01:20.340 --> 01:24.020
So the name of our Sidebar is going to be sidebar.

01:25.660 --> 01:31.760
Then the idae or can changes to anything we want because we use the sidebar in the blog section on this

01:31.760 --> 01:36.720
site when I call it the sidebar underscore blog.

01:38.240 --> 01:41.750
And then when he'd sell WordPress what goes before and after the widget.

01:41.810 --> 01:49.430
So if you go onto these sidebar doppie HP What we basically do is replace in these sidebar modules.

01:49.640 --> 01:55.760
So when it's there were press all the content would in these modules is surrounded by the div would

01:55.760 --> 01:57.590
a class a sidebar module.

01:58.680 --> 02:07.620
So let's change the div before the widget touch the class equal to sidebar.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.150
Module.

02:11.950 --> 02:12.840
And is a closed door.

02:12.860 --> 02:14.150
No that's fine.

02:14.150 --> 02:16.330
So then before and after the title.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.660
We go back into the sidebar.

02:19.660 --> 02:23.120
The title as a hate for or a level for head in.

02:24.670 --> 02:27.540
So change before title to be page four.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.630
And then Page four four after the title.

02:32.800 --> 02:38.200
And then say that and if you go back over to the Word Press Code X and then scroll down to the hole

02:38.200 --> 02:40.230
to display new wood areas.

02:40.690 --> 02:45.190
We need to copy this simple code and paste it into our sidebar.

02:45.370 --> 02:52.080
So copy this section for commissioned copy although without the page petersburg's sort of copying.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.200
Going go to the sidebar is up the age B.

02:57.150 --> 03:01.380
And then scroll to the very top and paces in just before all of the rest of the code.

03:04.270 --> 03:10.350
And we give our Sidebar the idea of sidebar on this god blog.

03:10.570 --> 03:13.650
So change it to areas where the horn right is.

03:13.930 --> 03:16.630
So Will changes to sidebar.

03:17.300 --> 03:22.290
Well miscall blog and the same of the bottom will changes to sidebar blog too.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.930
And and say that.

03:27.930 --> 03:35.100
So now if I go back in to the dush board and hit refresh you should see the woman go to the appearance.

03:35.100 --> 03:38.560
We've now got a widgets option so select that.

03:40.220 --> 03:44.750
Now we can see a list of all the available widgets and we can also make custom ones.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.860
And all we need to do is just drag these over to the side bar.

03:48.110 --> 03:51.110
And most of the widgets we are on to be the custom ones.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.240
So they're the same as our bootstrap site.

03:53.300 --> 04:00.230
But the first thing I want to add is a search box hunger search box insight yet so why not use a premade

04:00.300 --> 04:04.000
widget so simply drag the search box onto the sidebar.

04:04.930 --> 04:10.170
And then when I create the about us widget So we do that with the text box.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.810
So drag the text over to the sidebar.

04:13.970 --> 04:16.200
So the title for this was about.

04:18.090 --> 04:22.690
For the content we can copy the text from the sidebar doppie HP.

04:24.150 --> 04:26.770
So copy all the tags.

04:31.050 --> 04:32.610
Paste them in there.

04:32.850 --> 04:35.710
We don't need the p tags organ remove those.

04:43.610 --> 04:47.350
And the claws and Pete's are there so save those.

04:49.880 --> 04:54.560
And so it automatically add paragraphs so we can close that one down now.

04:55.020 --> 05:02.030
And also the search box the go any further let's just check out the site and see it all work.

05:02.040 --> 05:02.720
Okay.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.490
So head over to the blog.

05:08.770 --> 05:12.080
So it looks as old got a error in the sidebar update.

05:12.100 --> 05:16.240
P so head over to the side about IP HP.

05:17.210 --> 05:18.650
And it's on line 5.

05:19.630 --> 05:23.100
That looks is a which Missen some HP opening closing times.

05:23.370 --> 05:26.830
So at the top open up the HP.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.430
Not much is the close inside there.

05:31.710 --> 05:35.600
So where they start and targ the close in understand time there.

05:35.610 --> 05:40.040
So we just need to close off and save and that should be okay now.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.340
So refresh.

05:41.940 --> 05:47.700
So good to know we've got the search box in the sidebar we've got the above was section show and twice.

05:47.980 --> 05:53.060
So go into the sidebar and delete the sidebar module.

05:54.670 --> 05:58.110
For the bolas section and save.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.910
And now we just left with the bulls widget.

06:04.690 --> 06:07.930
So next we'll do the archives on the categories.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.190
So back into you were press.

06:12.230 --> 06:16.170
Into the dashboard appearance and widgets.

06:16.970 --> 06:18.940
So were press makes it really easy for us.

06:18.960 --> 06:24.980
Are the archives and categories you can see on the left that the archives and categories are being created

06:24.980 --> 06:29.320
for us so drug in the archives and give it say all.

06:31.420 --> 06:32.330
And then save.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.720
And do the same with the categories.

06:37.180 --> 06:38.940
So drop that in just below.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.990
Give it a title of categories.

06:46.770 --> 06:47.670
And save.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.170
And you can't delete these now from i'll footer.

06:53.350 --> 06:59.770
So the sidebar module for archives I can go and also for the categories.

07:01.680 --> 07:02.940
We're going to do that too.

07:04.960 --> 07:11.370
And lastly we'll do the follow section and it's is going to be a text widget like the above was section.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.030
So while we're in the sidebar let's copy the content.

07:14.320 --> 07:22.150
So when it's copy the font or some icons for Facebook to Google Pinterest and YouTube.

07:22.630 --> 07:23.890
So cut them out.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.060
I'll catch you just delete the module now.

07:28.220 --> 07:34.790
And say that back into the widgets drug one more text box into the sidebar.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.300
And the title is follow us.

07:42.380 --> 07:43.390
In the condom.

07:44.470 --> 07:45.470
Hit save.

07:47.850 --> 07:50.200
And then back into the blog and check it's all work.

07:55.070 --> 07:58.220
Goods were the search the about the archives.

07:58.220 --> 08:01.620
Categories and the social media section.

08:01.850 --> 08:05.170
Great so of this sidebar looks pretty much the same as before.

08:05.240 --> 08:10.850
It's now a lot more modular and it allows the logged in user or the site administrator to be able to

08:10.850 --> 08:13.400
change that about or add new widgets.

08:13.460 --> 08:16.040
So that's pretty much everything done for this bit.

08:16.100 --> 08:21.910
And it's one hour a little bit as says particularly for the search box just because the search poor

08:21.900 --> 08:28.580
needs a little bit of room and also make the search box look more like the input buttons that were used

08:28.580 --> 08:30.040
in the boost up website.

08:30.440 --> 08:36.260
So let's go to the style dotsie SS and then copy a comment.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.650
They'll make a sidebar section.

08:43.440 --> 08:48.900
So just above the mobile style home changed the comment to be cyber.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.980
So each one of the sidebar modules has a class of sidebar module.

08:57.980 --> 08:59.370
So we'll start with that.

08:59.420 --> 09:06.950
So the class of sidebar module and then we'll start with the input.

09:10.530 --> 09:14.910
So to space out when it's a margin of 10 pixels.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.560
And also set the maximum width.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.230
To be 100 percent.

09:23.690 --> 09:25.450
To save and take a look.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.940
Now is a little bit of space in around the input.

09:31.290 --> 09:38.300
So next we need to get the idea of the class for the impossible and so go into the Developer Tools.

09:42.030 --> 09:43.730
Then select the magnifying glass.

09:48.030 --> 09:48.700
And click.

09:48.850 --> 09:53.010
So we can see that we've got the idea of search submit.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.550
Then bucholtz style sheet.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.470
So create the idae.

09:59.730 --> 10:05.790
In fact instead the put on the styles are duplicating the styles in the sidebar we'll just add this

10:05.820 --> 10:08.100
up in the global section.

10:08.590 --> 10:14.680
So for a look for the styles of the button default when we use any exact same styles for this so can

10:14.680 --> 10:16.510
also add this on to the end.

10:16.900 --> 10:20.210
So the idae was search submit.

10:23.330 --> 10:27.530
And then say that will also add the hover.

10:27.530 --> 10:29.380
So ideal search submit.

10:32.630 --> 10:34.370
And then hover.

10:34.670 --> 10:38.690
So say that refresh.

10:40.010 --> 10:41.040
Another to work and so on.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.600
But the same style for the button and hover works too.

10:46.210 --> 10:46.840
So there you go.

10:46.840 --> 10:47.620
That'll work.

10:47.830 --> 10:50.810
And that's how you add custom widgets to Wordpress breastfeeds.
