Welcome to this video on advance custom fields.

00:04.160 --> 00:11.000
So so far all of the changes that we've made so far to the theme we've done in cold in the text editor

00:11.810 --> 00:19.910
birhor if the end user of your Feme wants change saum Information some text or some images we need to

00:19.910 --> 00:23.570
provide a way for them to change content quickly and easily.

00:23.570 --> 00:30.380
We don't know how to code in a great way of doing this is by adding advanced custom fields.

00:30.740 --> 00:36.590
So if you go over to the website which is advanced custom fields dot com.

00:37.690 --> 00:44.620
This is the website for a really easy to use plug in which you're going to implement into our theme

00:44.620 --> 00:45.450
in this video.

00:47.130 --> 00:51.720
So because this is a plug in looking at this easily in the dashboard.

00:51.930 --> 00:54.080
So go onto the dashboard.

00:55.660 --> 00:57.020
And it's like plug ins.

01:00.480 --> 01:01.680
Then it's new.

01:03.710 --> 01:09.680
So in case you've not used a Wordpress plugging before it's just a way of adding extra functionality

01:09.830 --> 01:11.270
to the word press corps.

01:11.330 --> 01:16.010
And this falls into different WordPress plugins available and it's really worth a quick search to find

01:16.010 --> 01:17.700
some great features to add.

01:18.020 --> 01:21.030
So unguents search for advanced custom fields.

01:25.850 --> 01:26.830
Then enter.

01:30.230 --> 01:35.840
So the version I'm going to use is the first one which comes up which is the advanced custom fields

01:36.380 --> 01:38.320
and then select install now.

01:42.240 --> 01:42.440
Okay.

01:42.480 --> 01:48.000
So once you got the success message at the bottom there then click on up to a plug in.

01:51.320 --> 01:55.910
So that activated will get a new option in the dashboard.

01:55.940 --> 02:01.370
So good on two custom fields and click on the song I show you how to do this.

02:01.370 --> 02:08.150
By going through the front page and changing some of the areas on there such as the the text undie office

02:08.150 --> 02:09.090
sections.

02:09.320 --> 02:16.550
So and when I enter a field group which is a group of fields which you want to change so select the

02:16.820 --> 02:17.590
newble and.

02:18.610 --> 02:20.280
And keep this organize.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.710
When a call is section the front page.

02:25.070 --> 02:26.100
Then publish that.

02:27.140 --> 02:32.570
And then I'm going to add a field and a field is one of the areas which you want to change.

02:32.660 --> 02:41.840
So if you go in to our From page Buggins of the local host and the tranquil site song they start by

02:41.840 --> 02:44.140
changing the feature text on the front there.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.680
This is gonna be a field.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.250
So back into the dashboard.

02:51.620 --> 02:53.670
The feel label is the name.

02:53.870 --> 02:56.330
So we call it the feature text.

02:57.560 --> 03:03.350
And if you just press tab were press law and mightly generate a field name and it is a name that will

03:03.380 --> 03:04.860
add to the code later on.

03:05.910 --> 03:09.190
So the field type is okay as text.

03:09.190 --> 03:13.070
And I'm going to add some instructions which shows up in the dashboard for the user.

03:13.170 --> 03:19.860
So when the changes to use this field to change the main features xt.

03:28.380 --> 03:29.040
And required.

03:29.050 --> 03:31.770
Yes we want that to be always there.

03:31.810 --> 03:34.050
You can create a default value if you want.

03:34.090 --> 03:37.660
Because it's required it's not really needed to know.

03:38.030 --> 03:39.640
And this field there.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.760
Okay it's and I will go with feature text field included.

03:43.810 --> 03:47.440
We've got the field name of feature underscore text.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.540
I'm just going to copy that name and then in the function section.

03:53.270 --> 03:56.050
If will look for the feature text function.

03:56.480 --> 04:03.740
In the front page section we can delete this fully responsive premium spa message so delete that and

04:03.740 --> 04:07.790
then we put in the function the underscore field.

04:08.660 --> 04:12.650
And then in brackets we put in the name of the field that we just created.

04:12.860 --> 04:14.550
So were copied that before.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.420
So paste in feature text and save.

04:19.750 --> 04:23.240
So if you go back over to the home page and refresh.

04:23.450 --> 04:28.780
So there's not enough now because we need to add this into the dashboard so because we all know what

04:28.780 --> 04:37.450
these custom fields to show up on the front page we need to change the location to be the page type

04:38.620 --> 04:40.250
equal to from Page.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.230
And then update that.

04:43.460 --> 04:45.760
So back to the SOC and hit update.

04:46.950 --> 04:52.700
So now if we go to the front page and then edit page and then scroll down.

04:52.950 --> 05:00.120
We should see the featured text section that was created and now we've got this as part of the dashboard

05:00.510 --> 05:03.480
the user can ah ah change different parts of the website.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.740
We're not known any cold.

05:05.070 --> 05:12.250
So we put the head in buckin so fully responsive then the brain psych.

05:14.330 --> 05:16.130
Premium spa theme.

05:18.990 --> 05:23.390
And the brace for wordpress.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.790
An update.

05:29.610 --> 05:30.870
Then view the page.

05:33.040 --> 05:36.060
So that's our text box in place.

05:36.280 --> 05:43.730
So if we go back to edit page one thing I just want to remove is the content editor because our page

05:43.730 --> 05:46.090
is generated by the template.

05:46.570 --> 05:53.490
So to remove that just go to the advanced custom fields and then in high on screen section.

05:53.980 --> 05:55.980
Just check the content editor.

05:57.780 --> 05:58.570
Update.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.510
And then refresh the.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.620
Edit page section.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.150
And now that's gone there.

06:07.350 --> 06:11.210
So they got said that's how you add a custom field in wordpress.

06:11.220 --> 06:17.190
We'll continue from page in the next video will start and custom fields to the latest Office section.
