WEBVTT

00:03.640 --> 00:04.300
Welcome back.

00:04.300 --> 00:06.850
Now we've got our bootstrap project all set up.

00:06.880 --> 00:12.630
Let's take a look at the final project and take a look at what we're going to be building in this section.

00:12.640 --> 00:19.330
So next we're going to be adding the hate mail for the header section the header section contains a

00:19.360 --> 00:25.690
navigation bar across the top which is going to have the logo in the top left and also on the right

00:25.690 --> 00:26.200
hand side.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.170
We're going to have the menu links.

00:29.170 --> 00:36.180
We're going to add a large background image and also the featured text in the centre which is going

00:36.190 --> 00:39.640
to be both horizontally and vertically aligned.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.750
The Texan image is going to be static for now.

00:44.050 --> 00:49.690
But once we get onto the WordPress section later on in the course the user will be able to change the

00:49.690 --> 00:52.790
background and also the text.

00:52.930 --> 00:54.900
So to get started with the head section.

00:55.030 --> 01:00.030
Let's head over to our text editor and let's get rid of the sidebar for now.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.160
So if we scroll down.

01:04.490 --> 01:07.070
Well can delete the hello world.

01:07.070 --> 01:07.950
Age One had.

01:09.020 --> 01:12.750
And then let's start with a comment for the dissection.

01:19.710 --> 01:23.650
Okay so the dissection will be between the header tags.

01:24.960 --> 01:29.590
And we're going to get started with the navigation bar at the top of the page.

01:29.730 --> 01:32.530
So that will be enough times.

01:32.730 --> 01:33.090
It's gone.

01:33.090 --> 01:33.640
How so.

01:33.660 --> 01:38.140
Bouchon classes the first one will be enough bar.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.270
And then another bar.

01:40.610 --> 01:41.500
Default.

01:45.270 --> 01:49.440
So we'll be using a lot of these bookstop classes as we go through the project.

01:49.500 --> 01:57.310
If you're curious to know exactly what each one of these is doing we can go over to the bootstrap SS

01:57.920 --> 02:00.250
in the SS folder.

02:00.270 --> 02:03.150
It will look for the bootstrap dot C S S.

02:03.450 --> 02:04.650
For example if we look for.

02:04.660 --> 02:06.210
Not by default.

02:06.720 --> 02:13.740
So having to boost upsy assess and if you use your text editor is find function and then type in the

02:13.740 --> 02:15.080
clash you want to look for.

02:15.910 --> 02:18.130
Some will look for no default.

02:18.430 --> 02:24.580
This will then take you to the section of the SS which applies so you can see it by a uddin Enough.

02:24.580 --> 02:28.820
By default it includes various borders and buckram colours.

02:30.860 --> 02:35.540
So we can use this if you want to know exactly what's going on in the CSF behind the scenes.

02:35.660 --> 02:41.330
It's also worth bearing in mind that any of these bootstrap classes we have included can also add to

02:41.360 --> 02:44.220
all variety in our own customs access file.

02:45.290 --> 02:50.970
So next we're going to add a div with the class of container fluid.

02:57.080 --> 03:04.870
And again contain the fluid is a bookstop Plus you can use container fluid which provides a fluid full

03:04.870 --> 03:05.740
weight div.

03:05.830 --> 03:12.520
All can use the container class by itself which includes a div with a fixed width and then within the

03:12.520 --> 03:13.430
container fluid.

03:13.430 --> 03:15.440
We're going to create a new div.

03:15.790 --> 03:17.960
We had a class of nav bar header.

03:21.260 --> 03:21.950
Would in this div.

03:21.950 --> 03:28.430
This is going to be the section which includes the information for screen readers and also we'll take

03:28.490 --> 03:30.900
a look at the finished project.

03:31.040 --> 03:35.320
You can see if we shrink the browser down it's fully responsive website.

03:35.630 --> 03:41.480
So once you get below a certain size navigation menu turns into a dropped menu.

03:42.510 --> 03:46.680
So the header is also going to contain the information for the drop down button.

03:48.050 --> 03:48.880
So let's start with.

03:48.890 --> 03:49.720
But no.

03:51.910 --> 03:54.520
So the UN is going to have a type.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.210
Off button will add some bootstrap classes.

04:00.330 --> 04:02.540
The first one is nav bar toggle.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.550
And then collapsed.

04:09.190 --> 04:11.200
It's going to be collapsed by default.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.370
So we're going to add the data toggle.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.250
To be equal to collapse.

04:20.670 --> 04:21.110
D.

04:21.130 --> 04:21.820
Data.

04:21.820 --> 04:22.720
Target.

04:25.650 --> 04:29.020
Is equal to what nav bar.

04:31.410 --> 04:32.480
I in UPS.

04:35.450 --> 04:37.220
So what the data Target is doing.

04:37.310 --> 04:40.610
This is Lincoln the button to a div.

04:40.610 --> 04:44.890
Would a class of not bar collapse and will create that after the button.

04:45.890 --> 04:49.180
Nested inside the ball will go into the.

04:50.860 --> 04:57.250
Free icon bars which are on the drop down button so the first one.

04:57.250 --> 05:04.020
These will all be between spam tags so the first spam tag will just be a class for screen readers.

05:05.340 --> 05:08.280
So this will have a class of s r only.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.670
And the text for the screen reader.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.400
We'll be toggle navigation.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.330
And their necks will add another spine.

05:20.350 --> 05:22.030
We have a class.

05:22.810 --> 05:24.050
Of Icom bar.

05:26.370 --> 05:29.050
So this is the first of the free icon bars.

05:29.070 --> 05:32.020
So it's got to be exactly the same for two more.

05:32.090 --> 05:34.890
So we can just copy and paste or duplicate that.

05:36.590 --> 05:38.540
Just change the spell in there.

05:38.550 --> 05:39.450
There we go.

05:39.780 --> 05:40.040
OK.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.030
So let's check that on the preview.

05:44.300 --> 05:48.790
Also on the smallish screen we've got the dropped arm bomb appear in there.

05:48.980 --> 05:52.530
And that should disappear once we get to a certain size.

05:52.550 --> 05:53.580
There we go.

05:54.050 --> 06:00.050
So next we need to add the logo to the top left hand corner and also the free navigation links.

06:03.130 --> 06:09.690
So to start the logo is going to go just below the button but still would in the nut bar had a diff.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.900
And if you're going to be a link.

06:12.160 --> 06:18.230
So we'll put the hatrack tags and this you've got a link back to the index page which is indexed I hate

06:18.290 --> 06:20.570
Jamal and D.

06:20.690 --> 06:21.960
But strub class.

06:23.430 --> 06:25.500
Is North bar brand.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.820
Because our logo is simply text.

06:30.830 --> 06:32.630
We can just type this in there.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.120
So tranquil spa.

06:36.210 --> 06:39.020
So that's the end of the novel barrhead dissection.

06:39.470 --> 06:41.400
So I'm going to add some comments.

06:46.730 --> 06:48.980
So we'll call this the nut bar header.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.680
I will end up there.

06:51.710 --> 06:54.020
So just below the nut bar had a diff.

06:55.230 --> 07:00.560
The next live will have the free links of Home Blog and latest news.

07:01.110 --> 07:04.340
So the container div will have the class.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.710
Of Columbus.

07:08.740 --> 07:14.430
And then next we'll add the nav bar collapse plus which we used for the data Target.

07:17.350 --> 07:20.930
And then in this collapse section will other what an ordered list.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.930
An Old BOOTS drop classes of now.

07:27.330 --> 07:28.200
Bar now.

07:30.530 --> 07:31.240
Also now.

07:31.260 --> 07:32.130
BAR.

07:32.670 --> 07:34.470
Right.

07:34.470 --> 07:38.090
Which pushes the navigation links to the right hand side of the div.

07:39.090 --> 07:41.050
And then frailest items.

07:42.840 --> 07:48.150
Which are also links so the hate Treff the first link.

07:49.230 --> 07:54.940
Is for home so this will link to the index page Jamal and the text was home.

07:56.950 --> 07:59.190
And we need to more list items.

07:59.190 --> 08:02.530
The second one is for the blog dot hates Jamal.

08:05.610 --> 08:11.390
And change the name and the third link is for the latest new section.

08:13.380 --> 08:16.370
Now I'm just going to leave the link empty for this one.

08:16.680 --> 08:20.410
We'll be creating a template for the blog section use and bootstrap.

08:20.560 --> 08:26.850
But when it comes to the latest new section this is gonna be dynamically generated in wordpress.

08:26.940 --> 08:33.300
Were basically going to be using the blog page but we're just going to use a filter just to filter all

08:33.300 --> 08:36.720
the blog posts to be the latest news category.

08:37.410 --> 08:39.870
Then add some comments.

08:39.990 --> 08:43.170
So let's first add a comment to the nub bar collapse.

08:43.900 --> 08:44.800
Closing of.

08:48.090 --> 08:49.710
And then the last one is for the.

08:49.770 --> 08:51.150
Contain a fluid.

09:00.770 --> 09:02.140
Now can close that up there.

09:03.480 --> 09:06.960
So let's check that out in the browser and see how that's look.

09:08.770 --> 09:09.100
Great.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.840
So we've got the logo appear on.

09:11.080 --> 09:16.030
We've got the Freeling on the right hand side and shrinking the browser down.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.620
That drops to a drop down button.

09:19.430 --> 09:22.030
Which expands to show the three links.

09:24.020 --> 09:26.840
And by the way because the drop down button is working.

09:26.990 --> 09:35.180
This also shows that I would javascript stropped javascript which is included in the J s folder is all

09:35.180 --> 09:40.250
link correctly and it's all working down at the very bottom of the page you can see that the links are

09:40.250 --> 09:46.960
already included in the bootstrap template both for jaquie and also the bootstrap javascript.

09:47.030 --> 09:48.870
So know that's all working correctly.

09:50.060 --> 09:53.280
So now we've got another station bar complete.

09:53.540 --> 09:58.730
Next we're going to start on the background image and also the text.

10:00.790 --> 10:03.300
And we can call this the feature section.

10:03.970 --> 10:08.710
So we're going to put this just below the navigation.

10:08.710 --> 10:10.070
So let's copy that header.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.650
And then paste it just below the close enough tigg.

10:14.670 --> 10:16.090
But still would in the header.

10:18.330 --> 10:21.660
And when I call this the feature section.

10:25.020 --> 10:30.230
So because the feature section has a large background image which you want to stretch the full width

10:30.230 --> 10:35.030
for the page you're going to make use of the bootstrap contain a fluid again.

10:41.050 --> 10:48.580
And then within the container fluid we need to add a new a bootstrap class of role and also our own

10:48.670 --> 10:51.480
custom class which is feature.

10:51.550 --> 10:58.260
So we're getting to that in the C S S in the next video and then add the path to the image.

10:58.330 --> 10:59.880
So image source.

11:01.190 --> 11:09.650
So we've got a images folder within the project and then the large background image is called Lake b.g.

11:09.800 --> 11:10.740
DOT j peg.

11:13.310 --> 11:15.550
And add some old text in there.

11:16.020 --> 11:18.130
I'm going to ARDS late background.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.110
So let's check if that's working okay.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.590
Head back in to our project.

11:28.590 --> 11:34.130
So logos so there's a large image pain in the background so let's next hour the text which overlays

11:34.130 --> 11:35.150
that image.

11:35.600 --> 11:41.450
So the text will be grown in its own div and we'll add a custom class.

11:42.370 --> 11:43.710
Of feature text.

11:47.520 --> 11:54.770
And then inside this container will add our text in the tags so the text was fully responsive.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.430
Premium spa theme.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.030
For wordpress.

12:06.310 --> 12:13.150
And then I'm going to add some braid tags after the word responsive and also after the word theme.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.740
Just to split that up onto different lines.

12:18.540 --> 12:21.500
So it will go back into the browser and see how that's look.

12:21.770 --> 12:26.790
We won't have the text appearing in over that image just yet because we need to add some success for

12:26.790 --> 12:28.430
that to work.

12:28.510 --> 12:33.090
What the text is appearing just below so we don't need to worry about that just yet will solve that

12:33.090 --> 12:34.520
in the next video.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.880
So we'll just finish this section off by in some closing comments.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.750
First of all to the fluid container.

12:44.740 --> 12:47.400
And then to the div with the glass of roll.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.850
And then the featured text.

13:01.210 --> 13:02.810
So there we go so that's the end of the page.

13:02.810 --> 13:04.610
Too small for the header section.

13:04.840 --> 13:10.870
If you join me in the next video will continue with the header section by uddin the access will also

13:10.870 --> 13:13.840
take a look at the stropped rows and grid system.
