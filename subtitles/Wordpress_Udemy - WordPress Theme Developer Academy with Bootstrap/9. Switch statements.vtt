00:04.800 --> 00:10.170
In the last video we looked up if l statements and holler can use them to tell the program what to do

00:10.800 --> 00:13.710
based on your face and condition is met.

00:14.660 --> 00:20.900
Now we're going to move on to look at a switch statements which is a great alternative to the if l statements

00:21.410 --> 00:23.980
if needs checked against many conditions.

00:24.760 --> 00:29.680
So I am when to get started by creating a variable called favourite food.

00:33.370 --> 00:37.370
And on a surface to be a string of pizza.

00:39.490 --> 00:45.040
And then when you use a switch statement to check many different types of food and then check if these

00:45.040 --> 00:48.340
match up with the variable of favourite food.

00:48.930 --> 00:53.640
So to be an ace which statements we use we switch key word.

00:54.860 --> 01:03.510
And then inside a set of buckets would then pass in the variable that we want to check against.

01:06.280 --> 01:11.680
So place inside there and then just like the if statement that were used before we then use a set of

01:11.680 --> 01:18.610
curly braces and there would be these curly braces we can put in all the expressions that we want to

01:18.640 --> 01:19.650
check against.

01:19.790 --> 01:24.200
And then also provide a outcome if this expression is met.

01:24.580 --> 01:30.260
So we switch statements we check against different cases so we use the case keyword.

01:30.310 --> 01:36.470
So the first case we could check if the favourite food is a courey.

01:36.850 --> 01:39.540
So let's test if this is equal to Curry.

01:41.260 --> 01:46.910
And only to use a colon and then once we done the call on we can then provide an outcome if this is

01:46.910 --> 01:48.270
a match.

01:48.620 --> 01:56.770
So we're going to use a echo and then we're going to say I'll of carry for dismissal on at the end.

01:57.990 --> 02:04.320
And then after each one of these expressions we need to use the break keyword with the semicolon.

02:04.800 --> 02:09.040
So this breaks out of the switch statement if this is true.

02:10.290 --> 02:13.000
And if not it's moved down to the next case.

02:14.860 --> 02:23.850
So we use the case keyword again and this time when a check if the case is Chinese again the colon and

02:23.890 --> 02:27.890
the echo of I love Chinese.

02:31.100 --> 02:34.500
And then just like before we break key word.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.940
And then one more.

02:37.950 --> 02:41.970
So case this time Pead sir.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.050
Echo.

02:47.020 --> 02:48.270
I love pizza.

02:54.050 --> 02:57.040
And if this is true we can break out of this which statements.

02:58.160 --> 02:58.410
OK.

02:58.410 --> 03:04.920
So that's how we lay out a switch statement is one more piece we need to add into here before we test

03:04.920 --> 03:05.440
that.

03:05.660 --> 03:12.010
We need to write a default case just in case any of these expressions above don't match.

03:12.900 --> 03:15.320
So this is more of a buckle up.

03:15.470 --> 03:16.320
So default.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.700
And then the colon.

03:18.090 --> 03:20.660
And then to echo.

03:22.110 --> 03:23.350
I don't know.

03:28.520 --> 03:28.730
OK.

03:28.760 --> 03:33.540
So let's say this and test it so he can probably work out what's gonna happen here.

03:33.620 --> 03:36.080
We've got our favourite food said pizza.

03:36.260 --> 03:41.670
So we should get the case of pizza much dough up in an eco Isle of pizza.

03:44.340 --> 03:45.020
I do.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.230
So lurchers changes to be Chinese.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.210
And that should change too.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.680
I love Chinese.

03:56.090 --> 03:57.250
And then Cory.

04:02.060 --> 04:02.950
That works fine.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.430
Of kurri.

04:04.880 --> 04:08.700
So I will test the falso can changes to be pasta.

04:09.200 --> 04:14.770
So we don't have a case for Pastor So we should get the default of I don't know.

04:16.530 --> 04:17.970
Which would you say that's good.

04:19.120 --> 04:19.710
So that's it.

04:19.710 --> 04:21.750
That's all we can use a switch statement.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.350
MP HP to test against multiple outcomes.
