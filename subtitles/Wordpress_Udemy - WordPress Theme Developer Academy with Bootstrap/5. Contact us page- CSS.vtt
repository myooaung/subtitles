00:03.000 --> 00:06.630
So welcome to the last video in these bootstrap template section.

00:06.750 --> 00:09.990
So we've added the hate schimel for the Contact Us page.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.980
And next we'll add the CSA to make it look a little bit more like the final project.

00:17.460 --> 00:20.140
So let's head over to our custom success.

00:23.670 --> 00:25.580
So if a copy of the comment.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.290
I will paste is just below the above was section.

00:29.870 --> 00:32.040
Going to call this the Contact Us section.

00:38.280 --> 00:41.080
So we get this section a is of contact.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.770
To get started.

00:43.810 --> 00:48.780
Want to add some pun in on to the bottom of the div of 30 pixels.

00:49.720 --> 00:51.680
Just to give it some space from the footer.

00:52.970 --> 00:59.120
Will also add the text the line of centre nissel make sure that the divider image is in the middle of

00:59.120 --> 01:03.040
the page and then next will start in the left handed.

01:03.320 --> 01:07.480
So let's start by adding some stylin for the address section.

01:07.820 --> 01:14.210
So if we go back into the contact page we added a custom class of address and this class was surround

01:14.210 --> 01:16.740
and the whole of the address section.

01:16.790 --> 01:20.460
So back into the customs we assess we can use that now.

01:23.280 --> 01:27.570
So first of all we'll make sure the text is aligned to the left.

01:28.750 --> 01:34.100
Will add a bit of space into the top so it's a margin top of 30 pixels.

01:35.790 --> 01:37.650
To make the font size a little bit bigger.

01:38.470 --> 01:42.060
Will just increase the font size to be one point to Ms.

01:44.430 --> 01:45.800
To space out the lines.

01:47.590 --> 01:49.950
It set the line height to be two ends.

01:51.700 --> 01:52.680
When I take a look.

01:54.040 --> 01:54.670
Refresh.

01:57.690 --> 01:57.910
Oh.

01:57.950 --> 02:03.260
So next I want to change the colour of the icons to match the rest of the website.

02:03.720 --> 02:08.580
So within the address Plus Target the icons with the eye.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.400
So let's change the colour of the icons.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.120
To be 9 7 6 8 9 see.

02:16.260 --> 02:17.080
Take a look at that.

02:20.900 --> 02:21.370
Okay good.

02:21.410 --> 02:24.710
That's changed the icon to the pinky purple cool.

02:25.180 --> 02:27.060
That's all fine for now.

02:27.080 --> 02:33.140
So the next thing I want to do is much the 30 pixels margin so the frame is aligned at the top.

02:33.370 --> 02:36.050
And for now I frame stretchin a little bit too big.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.300
So will add the maximum weight of 100 percent to keep that wood in the container.

02:45.010 --> 02:47.630
So let's let the contact idae.

02:48.410 --> 02:49.390
The I frame.

02:51.620 --> 02:53.560
So much the margin top.

02:54.930 --> 02:57.450
Of the left undies to be 30 pixels.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.270
Answer.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.200
I framed as it too big.

03:01.340 --> 03:04.480
Will set the maximum which to be 100 percent.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.640
Let's save and take a look at that.

03:11.530 --> 03:16.780
Great site looks a lot better we've now got the two divs aligned from the top and also the frame doesn't

03:16.780 --> 03:22.920
stretch too wide so the last thing I want to change is just add a little bit a pub in or margin onto

03:22.930 --> 03:27.780
the top of the message section so it keeps that consistent with the rest of the website.

03:28.180 --> 03:33.630
We'll set that to be 30 pixels so we give this section a custom class of message area.

03:37.980 --> 03:40.430
So we just need to add some margin onto the top.

03:41.470 --> 03:42.830
Or 30 pixels.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.370
Um refresh.

03:48.660 --> 03:51.370
Great site looks good on the desktop view.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.780
If we just shrink the browser down to the mobile view.

03:56.850 --> 03:58.320
There's not a lot we really need to do.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.660
There's just one thing that I want to change.

04:00.660 --> 04:08.000
We need to add the text line to be Centre on the mobile view so we can do that down in the media query.

04:09.010 --> 04:14.650
And because we've also got the foot in class to have the Texas line centre could just add this on to

04:14.650 --> 04:18.120
the end so we can add our class of address.

04:19.650 --> 04:20.940
Save and take a look at that.

04:24.710 --> 04:25.010
Great.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.280
So there we go site looks a lot better now.

04:27.290 --> 04:30.230
That's the boost of template finish for our projects.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.030
And that's the end of this section.

04:32.030 --> 04:32.980
So thanks for listening.

04:33.020 --> 04:38.070
