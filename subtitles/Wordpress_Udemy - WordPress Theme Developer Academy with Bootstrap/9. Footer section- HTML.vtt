00:00.850 --> 00:02.170
So welcome back in this video.

00:02.170 --> 00:05.370
We're going to be quain the footer section for our index page.

00:05.680 --> 00:13.000
So we're four go back into our text editor and underneath the shop online section that you copy the

00:13.750 --> 00:15.030
comment.

00:16.620 --> 00:20.330
PACE down below I will call this the footer section.

00:24.520 --> 00:30.130
So we don't need to use the section tigers like previous sections because there is a footer tag we can

00:30.130 --> 00:31.850
use in place.

00:32.140 --> 00:33.890
So we use the footer tigers.

00:35.010 --> 00:43.520
Because the level 2 head in and the image for the footer section is pretty similar to the last few sections.

00:43.590 --> 00:46.130
We can just copy that section from above.

00:46.470 --> 00:48.130
So copy of the container.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.030
From the shop online section.

00:55.100 --> 00:57.110
Peyster in between the foot at Ikes.

00:58.730 --> 01:00.770
So we don't need the button.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.050
So we're going to leave that section.

01:05.590 --> 01:09.880
And the shop online section is going to be keep in touch.

01:14.870 --> 01:19.280
Just after tech centre they're going to reuse the margin bottom.

01:21.610 --> 01:23.520
Class which we used earlier on.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.250
In the latest Office section.

01:28.250 --> 01:31.340
And this is you going to push the content away from the divider.

01:32.870 --> 01:36.550
Let's save and take a look at that and refresh.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.670
So there's a level 2 heading and the divider.

01:40.970 --> 01:47.090
So next we need to create a new role which is going to have the address on the left and some of the

01:47.120 --> 01:48.680
navigation links in the middle.

01:48.830 --> 01:52.260
And then some of these social sharing buttons on the right.

01:52.520 --> 01:58.550
So to put these free sections in we'll create a new role just underneath the last one.

01:59.460 --> 02:02.850
So a new div we a class of row.

02:05.250 --> 02:10.580
And then within the role we're going to create three more divs which are going to be for column Dev's.

02:13.340 --> 02:15.340
The div class then call.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.360
S for.

02:19.450 --> 02:20.920
And it can copy this div.

02:22.980 --> 02:24.870
And paste in two times.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.620
So the first div has the address in.

02:29.660 --> 02:34.190
So we're going to be semantic and the address tigers.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.990
So the first line is tranquil spa.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.330
And then after the break.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.230
And that's some address lines.

02:45.310 --> 02:46.750
So address line 1.

02:48.740 --> 02:49.650
And breaktime.

02:50.690 --> 02:56.310
Duplicate this two more times to qurei address line 2 and free.

02:57.160 --> 03:02.030
And then the second div had the on ordered list with the navigation.

03:02.140 --> 03:06.780
So between the two old tags we'll create for list items.

03:09.390 --> 03:14.470
Between the list tyke's will create some links so a page ref.

03:15.860 --> 03:18.800
And the first link is going to be about us.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.320
So this will link to about hate email.

03:23.720 --> 03:28.570
I will put that link in their form we create that and the text is about.

03:31.190 --> 03:34.550
And copy and paste or duplicate this three more times.

03:35.440 --> 03:39.240
So the second link is the Contact Us.

03:41.740 --> 03:42.970
So let's change that now.

03:45.390 --> 03:48.610
And the link is going to be contact hate email.

03:51.220 --> 03:53.330
The third link is to the blog.

03:53.620 --> 03:55.760
So the link is blogs or to email.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.220
And the text or blog.

03:59.230 --> 04:01.550
And then lastly it's the latest news.

04:05.320 --> 04:10.490
And can just delete the link there because we're going to be generated not dynamically in wordpress.

04:10.510 --> 04:12.030
So let's take a look at the browser.

04:15.270 --> 04:15.680
There we go.

04:15.730 --> 04:17.490
Our first two sections.

04:17.670 --> 04:22.020
So nobody needs to create the social media section on the right.

04:22.170 --> 04:23.740
So the third div.

04:25.060 --> 04:30.460
We'll begin with Pete eyes and the text of the follows.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.400
And then blow the follows text.

04:34.400 --> 04:39.240
We're going to use the font awesome icons for links to social media.

04:39.470 --> 04:46.580
So we add the font awesome icons with these I tigg and then add a class.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.850
So the first class is f a.

04:49.740 --> 04:55.310
We're dufour all the icons and then the facebook icon is f a dash.

04:55.310 --> 04:56.140
Facebook.

04:58.890 --> 05:05.270
And then to make the icon slightly larger than normal we add the class of f a dash LG.

05:06.730 --> 05:07.610
In close up.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.950
And then create far more links.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.820
So the second one is the link to Twitter.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.920
So did a twitter.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.750
Icon free is Google Plus.

05:28.820 --> 05:30.100
And then Pinterest.

05:35.130 --> 05:37.380
And then finally it's YouTube.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.340
So let's save that and see how that's looking now.

05:44.300 --> 05:44.570
Good.

05:44.570 --> 05:47.900
We've got the five social media icons where they should be.

05:49.950 --> 05:55.180
And then the last thing we need to do is add the copyright section at the very bottom of the page.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.470
So let's add that now.

05:58.700 --> 06:02.890
So just below the container but still in the footer section.

06:04.290 --> 06:05.950
We'll add a new div.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.860
Would it class of contain a fluid.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.300
So dishpans the full weight of the web page will also armed and eidy.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.590
Of copy for copyright.

06:25.640 --> 06:31.210
And then a div with a class of call S M 12.

06:33.130 --> 06:35.080
To make a 12 column container.

06:36.480 --> 06:43.590
And then the text between the Peter links will add the copyright symbol which is unpersoned and then

06:43.590 --> 06:45.630
copy semicolon.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.000
So 2015 tranquil spa.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.710
And then let's add some comments.

06:57.430 --> 06:59.810
So this is the and give for the role.

07:04.570 --> 07:07.730
And this is the 12 column container.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.150
And finally the fluid container.

07:14.090 --> 07:15.030
Let's take a look.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.790
Great so that's all the hate Jamal added for the home page.

07:20.810 --> 07:25.310
