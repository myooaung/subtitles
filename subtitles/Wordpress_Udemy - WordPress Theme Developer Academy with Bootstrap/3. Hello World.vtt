00:02.340 --> 00:06.400
Okay i saw this video is all about getting started with HP.

00:06.550 --> 00:10.270
We're going to take a look at the basic pay HP syntax.

00:10.370 --> 00:13.780
The way to roll it out and do a helliwell example.

00:14.360 --> 00:22.010
So to get started were going to go over to the Haiti docs inside your local host and then create a new

00:22.010 --> 00:22.900
folder.

00:23.660 --> 00:27.920
And Nicholas falder the HP basics.

00:29.830 --> 00:33.820
And then drag this folder into your text editor.

00:34.090 --> 00:36.710
So I'm gonna use brackets by Adobe.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.340
And then drugger enter them.

00:41.650 --> 00:49.240
So to get started and when I create a HP page just at work and would so create a new page with a command

00:49.510 --> 00:52.470
or control and inside brackets.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.970
And first of all I want to say this page.

00:56.310 --> 00:58.550
As Hell world.

00:59.820 --> 01:03.270
Make sure it's got the p HP extension at the end.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.880
So save that inside chb basics.

01:07.300 --> 01:11.270
And then we need to create a basic case to mail skeleton to begin with.

01:11.630 --> 01:13.710
So I am using the emett plugin.

01:15.250 --> 01:18.010
So if you not use night youll need to type this all manually.

01:18.010 --> 01:25.230
But if you do download at or you need to do is type in hates jimo call on 5 and then hit the tab.

01:26.210 --> 01:29.590
And then it fills in all the hate email 5 scale and for you.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.950
So let's call it the hello world.

01:36.650 --> 01:38.730
Then let's get to work within the body section.

01:39.780 --> 01:40.030
OK.

01:40.060 --> 01:45.650
So to work with HP we need to provide a opening and a closing task.

01:45.820 --> 01:48.810
So the opening site mph P looks like this.

01:49.000 --> 01:58.930
It's the angle brockett question mark an MP HP and it indicates that P HP cold is what start then at

01:58.930 --> 02:05.760
the end of the BHP when it's a close in tigg which is a question mark and the right angle rocket.

02:05.890 --> 02:09.250
So all the P HP cold goes in between here.

02:09.460 --> 02:16.850
So the first thing I do is just print some text to the browser so and when to do that with a Echo.

02:17.650 --> 02:24.530
So type in Echo and then because it's going to be text when he put it in quotations.

02:25.010 --> 02:26.370
So hello world.

02:29.310 --> 02:33.200
And then at the very end we'll close a statement with a semicolon.

02:33.450 --> 02:34.560
So say that.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.970
So this is how we print something to the browser use and pay HP.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.620
So go over to your browser.

02:44.290 --> 02:47.240
And then type in the local host.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.680
And then go to the file that you put inside the heggessey Docs.

02:51.910 --> 02:56.620
So it's back to basics and then hello world.

02:56.620 --> 02:57.100
So there we go.

02:57.100 --> 03:02.380
So display in the browser is a text that would just echoed of Hello World.

03:04.410 --> 03:07.030
We can mix a much p HP in amongst.

03:07.050 --> 03:08.140
Hate him all.

03:08.610 --> 03:15.000
So instead of having the title as typed in there which is what's called hardcoded.

03:15.620 --> 03:18.530
Someone said it typed in there we can open up the page.

03:18.530 --> 03:23.690
Be an end to the echo.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.340
Hello world.

03:28.550 --> 03:33.630
And I made sure the BHB is closed off with a question mark on the angle brackets.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.330
So save that.

03:35.930 --> 03:42.620
And then if we refresh we should now see that the title at the top of hell a world is now being produced

03:42.620 --> 03:44.170
with BHP.

03:44.810 --> 03:50.620
So just to make sure or type in impy HP and then refresh.

03:50.690 --> 03:57.500
No obviously this has been generated with the HP sort of a mix and match the BHB in amongst.

03:57.530 --> 04:04.430
Hate to metal as long as you have the open homepage beats args and the close and BHB tags properly set.

04:05.460 --> 04:09.120
Comments impy HP is similar to lots of other languages.

04:09.330 --> 04:12.030
We can comment out some code that were no longer needs.

04:12.250 --> 04:15.680
All can use a comments to type in some notes.

04:16.540 --> 04:20.940
For ourself or the programmers that we want the program to ignore.

04:21.280 --> 04:25.750
So for example if we no longer wanted to display this morning the.

04:25.960 --> 04:33.910
To ignore it would use to forward slushes and can see the text editor makes the lango great so can tell

04:33.910 --> 04:36.380
us being commented out correctly.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.250
Selfish say that and then refresh.

04:39.250 --> 04:43.220
That should disappear because it's no longer being processed.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.040
So let's just remove this.

04:46.600 --> 04:54.350
Comments are also useful for creating notes so I can make a note to our Self say in display.

04:55.950 --> 04:57.330
Hello world.

04:58.110 --> 04:59.360
To the browser.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.770
And this is what's called a single line comments.

05:04.810 --> 05:07.610
Would you want to comment I'll a single line of code.

05:07.810 --> 05:10.020
Would you use the two forward slushes.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.370
If you want comments I'll more than one line.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.910
We can use that word a multi-line comment.

05:16.310 --> 05:18.550
So it's a forward slash and a star.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.760
And then I can comment on more than one line.

05:22.480 --> 05:26.260
So will paste in the hello world two or three times.

05:26.950 --> 05:30.270
And end that with a star a forward slush.

05:31.790 --> 05:36.930
So this is how your comments are one line and this is how the comments out more than one line.

05:37.670 --> 05:44.140
So in small p HP section only the single echo of hello world will be displayed in a browser.

05:45.340 --> 05:48.610
So before with the title will look to uddin HP in amongst.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.030
Hates Jim L..

05:50.050 --> 05:56.650
We can also add hate to multiple eggs in amongst patch P and these will be displayed in the same way

05:56.680 --> 05:58.320
as if there were hate email.

05:58.390 --> 06:00.110
So for example in the echo.

06:00.130 --> 06:01.120
Hello world.

06:01.540 --> 06:09.120
If I wanted this to be a hate email level one hedin LOOK put the hate email Tug's of hate one.

06:09.890 --> 06:11.400
Before the text.

06:11.750 --> 06:15.580
I know what a hate warm clothes and Saag after this.

06:16.100 --> 06:21.420
And then instead of being displayed as normal text this an RB a level one heading.

06:22.040 --> 06:28.770
Self was save there and then refresh were norgate HELLO WORLD hours a heading in the larger font size.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.020
Unequal.

06:30.030 --> 06:34.190
In any time that you want so I can do the same.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.430
Ah this was a page too.

06:39.190 --> 06:44.190
And save and let's go over to the browser and there's our level to head in also.

06:45.380 --> 06:47.810
Okay such basic P HP syntax.

06:47.950 --> 06:51.110
That's how we can echo or print text to the browser.

06:51.580 --> 06:56.380
And also how can comment out cold as well as combined p h.b. would hate Jim L..
