00:01.310 --> 00:07.460
Okay so when the last video we moved down to the latest Office section of the website and in this video

00:07.490 --> 00:10.910
we're going to be completing the shop online section.

00:10.910 --> 00:15.720
Now the shop online section is a relatively straightforward section.

00:15.770 --> 00:22.480
We're going to use a similar level to head in and divider as we have done in the last two sections.

00:22.520 --> 00:28.850
We're going to add a button which is going to be a link to a shop here section and it's also going to

00:28.850 --> 00:30.620
be a large background image.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.550
I via the success.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.960
So over in the text editor.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.910
When I started the index page and create a new section.

00:46.060 --> 00:49.900
So where a paste a comment just below the letters office section.

00:51.550 --> 00:53.930
So this is called the shop online section.

00:58.240 --> 01:03.740
This has a section targ with an idee of shop online.

01:08.980 --> 01:15.410
And then the usual bootstrap container and row div would a class of container.

01:19.210 --> 01:21.350
Then would it in the container we have the ROW.

01:26.200 --> 01:33.090
And will copy the hedin and divide a section from the last section so it will copy the six column section.

01:34.730 --> 01:36.520
And paste up would in our own row.

01:38.610 --> 01:43.200
So the level 2 heading is the shop online text.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.040
And the image we need to change to be the purple image.

01:50.920 --> 01:52.720
Because on a white background.

01:54.850 --> 02:01.200
So just below the divider the A and hatrack if he's gonna be blank for now.

02:02.770 --> 02:05.870
The class is going to be the bootstrap Button class.

02:05.890 --> 02:07.090
So Beatty an.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.780
B.t. and default.

02:13.360 --> 02:16.330
And then the role it's going to be equal to but.

02:17.650 --> 02:20.760
Name a closer link off another the shopping text.

02:23.380 --> 02:24.670
Let's take a look at the browser.

02:28.460 --> 02:34.850
Says go ahead in divider and also the button default now can easily make the button appear in the centre

02:34.850 --> 02:42.280
of the page just by adding a boost from class so to the container just after the number of columns were

02:42.290 --> 02:46.520
in a deep blue stripe class of text centre.

02:48.420 --> 02:51.360
Now pushes the button into the middle of the diff.

02:53.630 --> 02:56.430
That's all the hate mail we need to add for this section.

02:56.690 --> 02:59.690
We'll just close off some of the divs weird comments.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.760
This one is the clauson Row.

03:04.650 --> 03:07.420
Then the final console.

03:10.170 --> 03:10.440
Okay.

03:10.480 --> 03:18.780
So next we need to go into the custom see assess and add the styling for the button default and also

03:18.780 --> 03:20.830
add the large buckram image.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.280
Just like the final website.

03:26.210 --> 03:28.360
So over to the custom C S S.

03:28.790 --> 03:30.790
So let your style with the sun.

03:30.980 --> 03:36.170
So because we're going to be using the button later on in the cos we're going to add it to the global

03:36.170 --> 03:37.990
section at the top.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.500
So when added just underneath the image.

03:44.100 --> 03:47.830
So the class was beating in default.

03:50.290 --> 03:54.280
And let's override the defog bootstrap values which some volar own.

03:54.290 --> 04:02.240
So first of all the background colour of the button will not be the blue colour which is a free nine

04:02.240 --> 04:03.450
free C.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.700
And will other border.

04:07.910 --> 04:11.440
Free pixels border solid.

04:11.930 --> 04:15.110
And the colours are going to be easy EF 0 EF 1.

04:19.790 --> 04:21.770
And a 5 pixel border radius.

04:24.740 --> 04:27.360
And then some puffins make the one a little bit bigger.

04:27.470 --> 04:32.140
Fifteen pixels on the top and bottom and first on the left and right.

04:33.280 --> 04:37.970
And the tech school is gonna be white.

04:37.980 --> 04:39.060
Let's take a look.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.350
So the bundes looking good.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.740
We just need to add the hover state.

04:45.990 --> 04:54.300
So if we go back into the earth and default and then hover.

04:58.620 --> 05:00.610
The jonesey buck runkel.

05:01.610 --> 05:04.710
To be 9 7 6 8 9 see.

05:06.790 --> 05:10.940
So when we hover over the ball and we've got the same purple colour as the background.

05:13.970 --> 05:16.930
So naana to go back and create a shop online section.

05:20.090 --> 05:24.230
The copy of the comments just above the mobile style in again.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.980
We call this the shop online section.

05:36.110 --> 05:38.660
So let's start with the background image.

05:39.050 --> 05:42.260
So the section had an idea of shop online.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.780
I'm I can change the background by adding background.

05:50.690 --> 05:51.850
And then you are real.

05:53.210 --> 05:56.780
And then in brackets we can add the file off.

05:56.780 --> 06:06.020
So dot dot to go back to the home directory fold slash images and then the images we want is product.

06:06.330 --> 06:07.090
JP.

06:09.170 --> 06:11.840
Or not to be in the centre.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.840
And lastly no repeat.

06:18.440 --> 06:24.710
So as it stands that image is in place but it's only taken up to the same height as the content that's

06:24.710 --> 06:29.220
already in place so we can change our by adding the minimum height.

06:30.760 --> 06:37.030
I will said that minimum height to be the same height of the image which is 852 pixels.

06:38.440 --> 06:43.220
And then it changes the text colour of the shop online head in.

06:43.480 --> 06:50.000
So the colour is going to have the value of foreknown for six for six.

06:53.680 --> 06:59.270
And then finally just to separate the button from the divider will add some margin to the top.

07:00.870 --> 07:02.920
So the shop online idae.

07:06.370 --> 07:08.130
Then the button default.

07:11.190 --> 07:14.650
Let's push the button down by adding some margin on the top.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.240
All 25 pixels.

07:18.710 --> 07:20.370
And let's see how it looks in the browser.

07:21.790 --> 07:25.140
Okay there we go the buttons now pushed on from the divider.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.630
So that's the end of the video.

07:26.700 --> 07:27.380
Thanks for watching.

07:27.390 --> 07:32.940
And if you join me in the next video we'll finish off the bootstrap home page by Add in the footer.
