WEBVTT

00:02.280 --> 00:04.650
OK so our website has taken shape now.

00:04.750 --> 00:10.970
We have completed the head dissection and also the featured image and text which then moved down to

00:11.000 --> 00:15.910
create the welcome section which has got links to all sections of the website.

00:16.130 --> 00:22.640
So if we take a look at the finished website the next part we're going to be create is the latest offers

00:22.640 --> 00:30.350
section and it's got to consist of a similar level to head in and divider to the last section and then

00:30.350 --> 00:37.010
when to create a new role we had three different special offers and three different offers are static

00:37.010 --> 00:37.970
text for now.

00:37.970 --> 00:44.330
But once we get to the WordPress section later on in the course will make sure that the user can log

00:44.330 --> 00:51.730
in and change the values so they can keep the special offers up to date even without any technical knowledge.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.940
So let's get started in the next page.

00:55.970 --> 01:03.670
So we'll get started with a comment and dissection is going to be called the latest offers and we'll

01:03.680 --> 01:07.000
do just below the welcome section that we're done in the last video.

01:07.890 --> 01:10.270
So who locate the closed section.

01:12.980 --> 01:14.860
And then paste a comment just below there.

01:16.180 --> 01:17.640
So that's latest offers.

01:23.280 --> 01:23.590
Okay.

01:23.610 --> 01:26.520
So the latest offers will have its own section too.

01:27.890 --> 01:31.670
This will have an idea of latest offers.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.800
There would in the section will create the usual div.

01:39.810 --> 01:41.500
Would a class of container.

01:46.360 --> 01:51.390
Then because the row that we're going to be using is pretty much the same as the last section.

01:51.500 --> 01:54.770
We can just copied the div with the class of row.

01:55.510 --> 01:56.820
Arm can reuse up.

01:59.890 --> 02:02.060
So paste paste wood in the container.

02:03.360 --> 02:07.820
And then we need to change the level to heading to latest offers.

02:15.090 --> 02:17.630
Because this time we're on a purple back round.

02:17.640 --> 02:22.830
Let's change the divider to be the divide a silver dot PRNG.

02:23.700 --> 02:24.900
Let's take a look at that.

02:30.570 --> 02:30.770
OK.

02:30.810 --> 02:34.820
So there's I was section with the level 2 hedin and the divider.

02:35.040 --> 02:41.340
So just going to add one more custom class which is going to be clustered some margin to the bottom

02:41.340 --> 02:42.650
of the divider.

02:42.900 --> 02:48.450
If you look at the finished project we need to make sure that the free divs below the divider are slightly

02:48.450 --> 02:50.650
pushed on from the image.

02:51.060 --> 02:59.690
So let's add the class to the row of margin bottom and will add the margin in the next video.

02:59.700 --> 03:00.720
In the CSA.

03:02.290 --> 03:02.750
Ah.

03:02.770 --> 03:06.270
A clause and comment to the container.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.060
So let's put the free special offers in the role.

03:13.190 --> 03:15.180
So let's create a new div.

03:15.530 --> 03:17.120
We had a class of row.

03:18.840 --> 03:23.760
So were going to create the free special offer divs but we need to put those free special offer divs

03:23.820 --> 03:33.630
into a container so when I put a full 12 column which contain a surround and those so div would a class.

03:35.620 --> 03:38.420
Of call S M 12.

03:39.100 --> 03:45.240
And I create a full 12 column container because of three special offer sections are nested.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.820
We need to create a new row.

03:50.780 --> 04:01.990
For those to go inside so would in the row the first special offer is gonna be div class Col S M for.

04:02.030 --> 04:09.350
So it takes up one third of the page and also so can other were custom styles will also iod a custom

04:09.350 --> 04:11.230
class of offer.

04:13.560 --> 04:14.580
So to start with needs.

04:14.580 --> 04:21.660
Put the price when he's put price in the spam tigers and then put the name on the special offer in a

04:21.660 --> 04:26.370
level three heading and then two separate paragraph tags just below.

04:26.670 --> 04:34.020
So for the price the spun and then in between there the first one had a price of six dollars.

04:35.860 --> 04:38.190
And then below that in the level three had him.

04:39.150 --> 04:41.540
The name of the offer.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.710
So the first one is family offer.

04:46.890 --> 04:49.810
I'm going to put a brake tag in there.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.810
And then the petersburg's.

04:54.790 --> 04:58.080
So the first line of text was in the bill.

05:02.450 --> 05:03.820
Then Mine too was great.

05:03.820 --> 05:05.340
They Alt.

05:09.270 --> 05:10.920
So let's see how that look.

05:14.860 --> 05:17.430
So it's all there but still a little bit of work to do with the.

05:17.530 --> 05:18.520
Yes yes.

05:18.520 --> 05:26.110
But let's continue for now as in the rest of the offers So if Will Okay the day of fact let some comments

05:26.110 --> 05:27.040
first.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.630
So she copied the contain a comment.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.170
And then the first one.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.750
He's from the class of offer.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.640
The second one.

05:41.390 --> 05:43.310
He's called nurse for.

05:44.590 --> 05:46.940
And then this is the role.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.870
In fact this is the nested role.

05:50.960 --> 05:54.300
Then just below that it's the 12th column.

05:59.070 --> 06:01.460
And then the final row container.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.490
So let's copy the full section.

06:05.910 --> 06:10.830
For the special offer and then let's paste it in twice just below.

06:12.940 --> 06:17.790
So the second special offer the price of a hundred twenty dollars.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.080
This was a bridal package.

06:21.150 --> 06:24.680
So the name of the offer was for the bride.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.220
Um the first line of the text was hair and makeup.

06:38.130 --> 06:41.260
And lastly it was the full pump package.

06:47.300 --> 06:53.170
And then the last special offer was the weekend pass which had a price of ninety dollars.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.990
So the name was Weekend Pass.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.640
The text was modern facilities.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.410
And the last one.

07:08.690 --> 07:09.290
The text of.

07:09.290 --> 07:10.670
Perfect gift.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.480
Okay.

07:14.850 --> 07:17.480
So back into the browser that's all and fine.

07:17.490 --> 07:19.320
That's exactly how we want it.

07:19.620 --> 07:24.480
And join me in the next video and we'll continue with dissection by ad in the C S S.
