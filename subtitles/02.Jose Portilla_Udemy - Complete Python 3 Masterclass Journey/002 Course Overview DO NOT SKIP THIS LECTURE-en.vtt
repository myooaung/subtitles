00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.710

Hello again and welcome to this course overview lecture I have one favor to ask of you and it's that



2

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.190

you don't skip this section of the course.



3

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.850

I know it can be very tempting to jump straight to some Python content but we cover some really important



4

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.670

and helpful things in this lecture mainly we're going to be discussing how to approach this course and



5

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.670

how to get help during the course first off in case you didn't catch it in the previous welcome video.



6

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.740

I want to make really clear that this course is going to be pretty different than any other course on



7

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.570

you to me.



8

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.700

I wanted to try to make learning Python as engaging and as fun as possible.



9

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.550

So there's a narrative story that goes along with this course and that includes seeing videos of actors



10

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.720

and characters.



11

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.400

I hope that this story helps give you context for the different tasks you're going to be learning.



12

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.620

I've tried to build elements of the story so it feels real including building real web sites e-mails



13

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.410

maps and more all to serve the story.



14

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.940

However I do understand that this approach isn't going to be for everyone especially if you already



15

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.040

know some Python and maybe just want to quickly jump into a particular topic like learning web scrapin



16

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.260

of Python.



17

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.840

This course is also designed to be modular so you can skip around two different sections if you want.



18

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.080

But if you are a beginner I would really recommend you start from the beginning.



19

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.920

Follow the narrative and I believe you'll make your entire experience more memorable and enjoyable.



20

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.970

Now let's discuss getting notes for the course we will mainly use a notebook system during the course



21

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.330

for typing out code and sharing notes.



22

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.780

Every single lecture has a fully explained book with example code and text.



23

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.910

Basically you pretty much also have the rule book along with this video course.



24

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.380

For example let's take a quick look at what these notebooks look like.



25

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.240

Here's what the course notes look like and you can see that there's folders and they're numbered basically



26

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.800

by section so you can just take them in order or you can jump to certain topics if you're not really



27

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.480

following the narrative story.



28

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.370

But the basic idea behind these notebooks is that they provide an environment where you can run code



29

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.690

and see detailed text.



30

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.020

For example when you start off the recruitment trials bootcamp you'll get files that look like this.



31

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.700

And then if you click on one of them they'll have information here that you can read about creating



32

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.740

strings and then also have code so you can see here that there's text that's explaining what's going



33

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.150

on as well as code that you can run and play around with.



34

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.970

And I think personally that's one of the best ways to learn Python.



35

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.360

We'll be discussing it a lot more detail how these junior notebooks work how to create your own notebooks



36

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.000

how to open these notebook files.



37

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.710

But I just want to make it clear that for the majority of course we're going to be using this environment



38

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.260

that allows you to have both explanatory text and code and every single lecture is going to have a notebook



39

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.700

related to it.



40

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.140

During the course we'll also show you how to work of text editors such as subline text to create standard



41

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.270

Python scripts.



42

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.800

And every note book can actually be easily saved as a postscript or many other formats including T.M.



43

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.650

the three forms we provide the notebooks in is a zip file that you can download straight from the lecture.



44

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.910

You should see a little blue pop up as revealing the lecturer saying that there's resources available.



45

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.300

One of them is a zip file of all the notes and files that we used during the course.



46

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.510

In other one is an NBA viewer's link recone just viewed the notes and download notebooks one by one.



47

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.200

And then there's also a bubbling reconvened the notes for the repo make pool requests.



48

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.530

In case you want to add stuff and you can even download all the notes as a zip file directly from the



49

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.000

Internet.



50

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.890

In case for some reason you can't connect to you to me.



51

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.820

You can check the resource links in the lecture for all the links for the three forms.



52

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.860

Basically have three different ways of getting it to download all the notes onto your computer.



53

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.770

Now finally how to get help with Python.



54

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.300

It's really easy to get stuck or make mistakes especially when you're learning a new skill or programming



55

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.170

language.



56

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.830

So I want to quickly talk about the fastest way to get help.



57

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.990

But during the course first I would always recommend that you do a google search for your error because



58

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.810

really about 90 percent of the time someone else has the exact same errors you and the first link on



59

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.500

Google is an answer to that error.



60

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.040

Or even if it's not an error if it's just a question on how to do something a full listen Python or



61

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.780

maybe how to do a particular task in Python just google searching that task.



62

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.050

There's almost always an answer already for you.



63

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.800

So that way you don't even need to wait for a response from us.



64

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.340

There's an answer ready to go on Google.



65

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.050

Now if you need something a little more technical it will more specific.



66

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.480

You can search a Web site known as Stack Overflow for Python questions you can even ask questions there



67

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.700

and often when you do a google search for replies on a related question the very first links are going



68

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.790

to be Stack Overflow links and stack overflow.



69

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.130

It's basically a Web site where people ask programming questions and then other people answer them and



70

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.350

answers get voted.



71

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.030

If they're useful Now let's see.



72

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.300

Of course specific questions maybe you want to have a more detailed question on a particular lecture



73

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.300

something that doesn't really make sense to Google search or search on stack overflow.



74

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.270

What I would recommend doing first is searching the Q&amp;A forums already on the to course.



75

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.420

It's likely that other students have maybe had a similar question to yours.



76

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.850

And that way you can quickly find an answer.



77

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.030

Now if you've tried all these things and still can't find an answer that's absolutely no problem.



78

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.180

You can post your question to the question answer forums and please include as much detail as possible



79

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.750

including what you've already tried.



80

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.300

Maybe links you've already visited screenshots and any other useful information and that will really



81

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.290

help us respond and reply to your question quicker and in a way that's useful to you.



82

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.320

Keep in mind for any issues related to the Tomy platform.



83

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.310

If you're having issues with video playback buffering or payments of course or how to get certified



84

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.690

of course please contact you to me support.



85

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.420

You can email them at support Itam Mediacom or we can just open a support ticket at the support page



86

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.970

for issues related to the new to me platform.



87

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.150

They're the best context for that.



88

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.660

Now as far as how to approach this course there's basically two different types of learners.



89

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.030

Well three really.



90

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.620

There is the faster and maybe sometimes more experienced learners.



91

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.040

There's kind of middle of the road learners and then there's the steadier learners for people who are



92

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.870

more experience of programming in Python and maybe just have taken a lot of online courses and you're



93

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.390

really fast at learning them.



94

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.960

What I would recommend doing is that you review the notebooks before the videos and just see if that's



95

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.530

enough for you.



96

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.550

You can usually just read and scan the note book faster than watching the entire video and if you already



97

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.800

get the idea from reading the note book maybe you just want to skip the simpler videos so you can kind



98

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.350

of jump around or go forward using those notebooks and what I would also recommend the fear a fast learner



99

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.870

is maybe watch the videos at a faster speed.



100

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.770

You can always watch them at speed and in fact.



101

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:36.290

Personally I always watch courses online at a faster speed and it's usually because the instructor has



102

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.200

kind of a steady tone when they're reading up the code.



103

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.540

So I like to watch it to X speed.



104

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.790

Now for people that are kind of steadier learners and you go a little bit at a slower pace I would recommend



105

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.210

is that you watch the videos alongside with the notebooks.



106

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.400

That way you can hear the explanation that's being given to you through the screencast And you also



107

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.400

have the code right there beside you in the no book format.



108

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.670

In case you want to copy and paste and make sure you don't have any typos.



109

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.590

So use really the notebooks as an extra resource to the videos and optionally You can also slow down



110

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.480

the videos.



111

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.370

I tend to speak at a pretty steady pace but sometimes it's a little fast for people.



112

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.580

Or maybe English isn't your first language so you can always slow down the videos as well.



113

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.040

Or you can also read along with the notebooks.



114

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.550

Do you have lots of options here.



115

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.910

And if you're kind of middle of the road between faster and ear you can mix and combine whatever strategies



116

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.620

work best for you.



117

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.540

And lastly but most importantly just a huge thank you from the bottom of my heart for enrolling in this



118

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.350

course.



119

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:38.060

I really appreciate every single student than enrolls in these courses and I am so happy that you've



120

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.940

chosen me to be your instructor for Python.



121

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.650

All right the next lecture after this is just a text article lecture a frequently asked questions so



122

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.340

you can have a quick access to useful links.



123

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.060

But after that it's the course so we'll see you there.



124

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.600

Thank you again so much.
