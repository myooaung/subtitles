00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660

Welcome back in this lesson we'll quickly discuss Python booleans.



2

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.550

Booleans are data types that indicate a logical state of either true or false.



3

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.670

And Python also has a placeholder object called None.



4

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.560

Let's go ahead and explore what these actually look like by opening up a Jupiter Notebook.



5

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.430

We're going to be working with them a lot more.



6

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.670

Once we begin to learn about control flow with Python but until then let's just go to understand what



7

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.970

they look like and what to expect in terms of syntax highlighting whenever dealing with a boolean or



8

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.560

a none placeholder



9

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.150

for booleans.



10

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.810

There's basically two keywords to know and that is true and false and that is true with a capital T.



11

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.290

Notice we immediately have a syntax highlighting indicating that this is a reserved keyword.



12

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.340

So we have true here.



13

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.540

And if I take a look at the type of True it returns back b l which stands for booleans and then we could



14

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.590

also assign true to be a variable and then a will be true.



15

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.710

Likewise there is also false.



16

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.320

So we can say B is equal to false and if we check the type of B it's also a boolean in the kitting false.



17

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.790

Later on we're going to learn how to use comparison operators in order to return booleans booleans.



18

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.870

Essentially when we were with control flow are going to allow us to indicate true or false whether we



19

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.350

want other pieces of code to run.



20

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.950

So just to show you a quick glimpse of what comparison operators look like we can do something like.



21

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:41.170

One is greater than two and you get back the boolean false because one is not greater than two or you



22

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.380

can check is one less than three.



23

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.520

And we get back true those purple comparisons are known as comparison operators and there's several



24

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.760

of them which we'll discuss later on.



25

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.890

Finally I want to discuss the fact that you can use none as a placeholder for an object that we don't



26

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.530

want to assign yet.



27

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.560

So we can say C is equal to none.



28

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.140

Notice that and is capitalized there.



29

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.310

So it's also a key word.



30

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.010

So if we take a look at c we don't actually get anything returned back in the note book because none



31

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.420

is essentially is a placeholder.



32

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.220

So nothing actually gets returned.



33

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.090

But you can check the type of see and see it it is none.



34

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.330

Type.



35

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.330

OK that's it for booleans and the none placeholder will be working with booleans.



36

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.100

A lot more when discussing control flow.



37

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.720

Finally up next we'll learn how to deal with simple text files.



38

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.930

Or see that recruit.
