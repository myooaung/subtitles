Congratulations on completing your first mission as an agent.



2

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.140

We don't have much time so here goes the intelligence you obtain from the last mission seems to point



3

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.150

to a zip file.



4

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.430

We think it might be best to have the instructor go over some topics with you before you execute your



5

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.430

mission.



6

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.740

The instructor will brief you on working with zip files and Huyton using the O S module to work through



7

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.130

directories and using regular expressions to find patterns in text files.



8

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.130

This will help us gain a better understanding of what the rows are after.



9

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.360

Make sure to learn these topics quickly so you can complete your next mission.
