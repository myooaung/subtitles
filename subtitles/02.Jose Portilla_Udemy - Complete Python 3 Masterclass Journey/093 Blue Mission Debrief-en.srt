00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,630
Excellent work on your mission agent Let's quickly have a de-briefing so we can discuss how you accomplished

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,210
your mission.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:15,530
The first thing we had to do was from Paille import the image functionality and then we could say open

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,690
up the links themselves.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:25,630
So one of the links was under blue mission files.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:34,140
We had the image link and if we check this you can see size and then if we checked with the actual links

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,670
looks like we have some sort of links in here so we can see there's HTP P.S. Google walk and then words

8
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,000
the other image we had was the cover image.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,990
So we can say cover is equal to image open.

10
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:57,770
And then we have blue mission files and we have a cover image there and then we can check the cover

11
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,240
size and then check the cover itself.

12
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,220
So here we can see the cover.

13
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,540
Now it looks like there was some sort of pattern we had a place to cover on top of this image.

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,560
But if you take a closer look at the sizes they don't match up.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,510
So we have ten ninety three by 693 here and then we have 12:26 by 7 7.

16
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:24,830
So we should be able to resize this cover in order to place it on top of this image to make sure they

17
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,470
fit and then we can't just place them over each other.

18
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:34,280
We should also add in some sort of alpha that way this White is has some transparency to reveal what

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,240
box is on the image links behind it.

20
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,790
So let's do that first let's resize the cover will say cover is equal to cover resize.

21
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,260
And we're going to resize it to the size of the links and we can just pass an attribute which returns

22
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:56,580
back the tuple So now if I check the size of my cover it's 12 to 6 7 7 7 just like those images of the

23
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,430
links.

24
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:08,820
Then let's go ahead and add some alpha to it so we can cover the Alpha and we can try 128 and experiment

25
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,460
with this value a little bit.

26
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,850
So if I take a look at my cover now it looks definitely a lot grayer.

27
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:27,720
So let's paste this over the links will say links paste and will provide cover the box and then also

28
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,780
indicate that the mask is also the cover and when you run this and then check out the links we can see

29
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,830
here that it's highlighting this link we need to go to.

30
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,950
It says go to this link and it looks like there's some sort of shortened google link.

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,370
G o o g l l d o 5 and T.

32
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,360
So let's type that in here.

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:03:03,370
HGT P.S. Colon's for Slash forward slash g o g l for Slash l d lowercase 0 5 and C and let's go to this

34
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:03,910
link.

35
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,490
If we go to that link it looks like we're on the right track.

36
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,450
Here you can see that there's some information and it looks like there's an encrypted message here.

37
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,850
It says the key for the encrypted message below is the largest known Fermat prime passthrough in S H

38
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,100
A three 256 bit hash.

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,800
It also says this number should be passed as a byte string placing B in front of the string.

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,190
And then there's some sort of encrypted message that we need to decrypt using that key.

41
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,780
So in order to solve all of this we're going to need to dive in and learn about encryption and decryption.

42
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,880
We'll see their agent.
