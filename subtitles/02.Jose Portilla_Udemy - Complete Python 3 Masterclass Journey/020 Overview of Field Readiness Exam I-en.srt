1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,920
Welcome to your first field readiness exam recruit this exam is going to test your basic skills of Python.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,270
Let's commence a quick overview of the exam notebook.

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,670
This is where we test your skills to see if you qualify to become a full field agent.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,970
Your job is to complete the tasks below to the best of your ability.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,270
Immediately after this will go over the solutions and check your performance your first task is to open

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:33,690
the exam that text that's in the same folder as this notebook with Python and make sure to only use

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,450
the read permission and store the contents of the file in a list called exam underscore lines.

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,790
You can code in this cell here and check the matching output in the cell here.

9
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:50,160
Notice how all these tasks have a cell free to code in and that a cell that you should not code in.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,340
That way you can retain the expected output tasks to ask you to count how many lines does the file actually

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,450
have.

12
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,100
Task 3 asks you to print out the fifth line of the text file.

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,920
Task for is to grab the last line of the text file and save it to a variable called last task number

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,280
5 is to use indexing to grab letter O and the last line of the file number 6.

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,980
How can you use Python's count how many words there are in the last line.

16
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,830
Test number 7 is to answer this multiple part question which is what data types are returned by the

17
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,610
following lines of code.

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,780
Basically you should just answer these outloud to yourself and then check with Python to see if you

19
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,120
got the right answer.

20
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,580
There is no actual need to write anything down here.

21
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:42,500
This is more just to check your understanding test number 8 is to check how well you understand indexing

22
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,360
and key calls.

23
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:49,460
So we give you a dictionary here with some nested levels of other dictionaries as well as nested lists

24
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,920
and your job is to get the single string.

25
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,460
Get me.

26
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,090
Please check out the directions here under task 8.

27
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:03,090
There's also 8 bonus tasks ask you how many unique integers are in this list and you're your continued

28
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,550
need to use a casting method that we actually haven't shown you yet.

29
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,120
But we will show you the solutions.

30
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,440
That's why a bonus task.

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,240
All right.

32
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,250
Best of luck.

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,190
We'll see you at the next lesson.
