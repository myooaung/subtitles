1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,670
Welcome to your final mission agent.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:08,170
Intelligence gathered from the previous mission left you with an encrypted message and a text file of

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,100
some geographical data in it.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,280
See if you can use regular expressions to parse through the text file to grab the coordinate data.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,930
Then plot the coordinate data to see if it helps figure out the key for the encrypted message.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,840
Best of luck agent.
