Hello and welcome to the course.

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,810
I'm very excited that you've enrolled and I'm even more excited that you're beginning your first steps

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,660
to learning Python before you begin the course.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,890
I just want to explain a few key details that will help give you the best course experience possible.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,150
First let's discuss how this course will work in general.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,290
This course is going to be a bit different than other technical courses you may have experienced in

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,610
the past in order to try to make the course in engaging in a fun experience for students.

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,100
There will be negative element to the course that includes actors and an immersive story.

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:40,820
The exercises and projects you do in the course will directly sync up with the story and give you interesting

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,320
context as to why you're learning different operations with Python.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,680
If that approach isn't well suited for your learning style you can always just skip the story that is

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,840
and go directly to the Python lectures and exercises without really missing anything.

13
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,930
And lastly just a few more points to help you have the best learning experience possible.

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,180
If you ever want to speed up the videos or change the playback streaming quality you can click on the

15
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,010
gear icon at the bottom of the video to adjust the settings if you want to download the videos for offline

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,560
viewing.

17
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,320
You can use the utility app if you ever have any technical or general platform issues during the course

18
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,960
such as issues of video playback buffering or questions about your certification for the course.

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,700
Please reach out to you to me support.

20

The remaining lectures in the section are just the Frequently Asked Questions article lecturer and a

23
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,970
short general lecture on how to get technical help on Python.

24
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,430
While you take the course please check out those lectures as well as they have useful information on

25
