1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,660
Welcome back recruit one of our key tools in the field is python.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,870
A general purpose programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 has quickly become one

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,780
of the most popular programming languages in the world.

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,740
Python has many advantages that you'll soon discover.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,530
Developers can learn it quickly.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,780
It typically involves less code than other languages and the syntax is easier to read.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:32,050
It's utilized in some capacity by pretty much every major technology company in the world and most importantly

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,570
has an overwhelming amount of additional open source libraries to help you accomplish any task and pretty

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:43,820
much think of whether it's web scraping working if images reading PDX reading see history files sending

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,560
emails.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,780
There there's a library already written in Python that can help you accomplish these things to install

12
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,310
Python.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,620
We'll use the free Anaconda distribution this distribution not only includes python but it also has

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,660
many other useful libraries including the Jupiter notebook system and even the spider development environment.

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:12,080
Anaconda can also easily be installed onto any major operating system including Windows Mac OS or Linux.

16
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,490
There's also many Khanda which is a smaller sized version of Anaconda.

17
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:22,560
In case you don't want to install or download such a large file to be an installation go to w w w the

18
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,790
Anaconda dot com slash downloads.

19
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,560
Let's head to that Web site and walk you through the installation process.

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,440
Welcome to the download page recruit so Entercom dot com slash download the website will look something

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,660
similar to this.

22
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,310
It may be updated from time to time as far as the look and feel but in general it will have the download

23
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,800
links for the various installers for the Windows Mac OS and Linux systems.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,750
And if you click on one of these you'll be brought down to the actual download links for the graphical

25
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,070
installers or the command line installers.

26
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,200
By the time you view this page it's most likely that 3.7 or 3.8 or even 3.9 has been released.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,380
So keep that in mind.

28
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,990
Any version of Python 3 should be fine for our use cases.

29
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,510
Now if you're on Windows you'll go ahead and download the graphical installer 64 bit or 32 bit depending

30
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,400
on your computer.

31
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,210
Most new computers are going to be 64 bit and if you have any questions on that you can click to learn

32
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,840
more.

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,550
But basically this is just a graphical installer so wizard that's going to walk you step by step on

34
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,240
the installation process.

35
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,150
So for Windows users click on the graphical installer download it.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,880
If you're on Mac OS click on this graphical installer and download it and then if you're on Linux you'll

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,880
be clicking on this installer and downloading it.

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,030
Keep in mind that Linux users have a command line installer and you'll have to type commands that will

39
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:51,060
show you in just a second once you've decided which version you're going to download.

40
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,750
Scroll down a little bit and click HERE where it says how to install Anaconda and depending on what

41
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,480
operating system you're currently on it will take you to one of these three pages here you can see installing

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,700
on Windows and it has step by step instructions for installing the graphical installers are really quite

43
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,380
straightforward.

44
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,060
You just select the defaults hit next and follow along with these.

45
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,570
Step by step instructions.

46
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,190
You don't need to worry about number two as far as verifying the data integrity.

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,420
If you're on a Mac OS it's basically the same thing.

48
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,590
If you click on that link on how to install it will guide you through the graphical installation process

49
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,610
for Mac OS.

50
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,700
Again step by step process.

51
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,700
Pretty straightforward.

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,120
Just continue on all the screens.

53
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,040
If you're on Linux it's going to be slightly different.

54
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:40,630
What you need to do is you'll be downloading a s h file and then at your command line or a terminal

55
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:48,530
you'll be running the following command bash and then right here down tilde downloads and the three

56
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,430
and then whatever version you happen to be clicking on.

57
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,960
Basically just copy and paste this command into your terminal.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,920
A quick note for Windows users and this is a pretty important one.

59
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,900
You'll eventually have a screen that looks like this saying advanced installation options and you can

60
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,540
choose whether or not you want to add anaconda to your path environment variable and call themselves

61
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,630
recommends to not add Anaconda as a path environment variable.

62
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,540
Since this can interfere with other software typically what it's going to interfere with is previous

63
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,050
downloads of Python.

64
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,500
However since this is probably your first download of python we actually highly recommend that you do

65
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,770
add anaconda to your path environment variable.

66
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,790
This will allow you to call Konda specific commands directly at your command line.

67
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,550
Again for Windows users we do recommend that you add anaconda to your path environment variable.

68
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,060
When you click on it you'll notice that it says not recommended.

69
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,210
It'll highlight and read.

70
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,440
Go ahead and click on it anyways and then install.

71
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:54,280
Now as we previously mentioned these graphical installation files include Anaconda Python and many other

72
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,130
libraries in this distribution so you'll notice that it's actually quite a large file.

73
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,250
About half a gigabyte depending on your internet connection or the space available on your computer.

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,580
You may not want to actually download install all these libraries.

75
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,840
Instead you probably just want the basics of Python for that use case.

76
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,290
You can look for conduct I O.

77
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,880
Slash many condo.

78
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,640
H Tim L.

79
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:21,670
Or just google search for many Konda and it will take you to the Mini-Con the links for the installers

80
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,250
and it's basically the exact same thing except it's a much smaller file and it doesn't include a variety

81
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,160
of the libraries which you don't really need to worry about.

82
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,770
So there's one for Windows Mac OS and Linux.

83
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,250
Interested in a much smaller file download you can use those installers as well.

84
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,230
However we do recommend that if you have the bandwidth and the space that you just download the fool

85
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:50,620
and a constellation once you've successfully downloaded and gone through the installation steps for

86
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,000
Anaconda you should be able to search your computer for Anaconda navigator.

87
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,350
This is a desktop app that allows you to quickly launch DUPERE notebooks.

88
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,060
So go ahead and confirm your installation by clicking on Anaconda Navigator.

89
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,090
It will load up and eventually you'll see something that looks like this with little quick dashboards

90
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,260
that allow you to launch different development environments.

91
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,540
There is that Jupiter notebook R-Maine development environment.

92
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,800
There's the cutesy cons..

93
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,440
Spider in other integrated development environment.

94
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,550
There's also other things like glue is Jupiter lab and even art studio.

95
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,790
If you decide to later on learn are you can install that as well as a click of a button.

96
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,510
But we're going to be using the Anaconda navigator to quickly launch Jupiter notebooks.

97
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,370
So now that we have Anaconda and Python installed on your computer you should be able to open up the

98
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,070
Anaconda navigator.

99
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:47,710
Up next we'll discuss how to actually run Python code either as a script at the command line or using

100
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,090
the Jupiter notebook.

101
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,080
We'll see there recruit.
