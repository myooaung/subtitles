that cannot be resolved through ordinary means as coding experts.



8

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.100

We use our skills to assist nations throughout the world but there are many threats and they have pushed



9

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.840

us to the breaking point.



10

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.750

Now we are in desperate need of new members to assist us in our mission though not just any one will
