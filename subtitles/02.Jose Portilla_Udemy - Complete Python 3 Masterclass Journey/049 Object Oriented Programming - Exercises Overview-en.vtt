00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.490

Welcome back recruit since object oriented programming can be a difficult topic when you first encounter



2

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.020

it.



3

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.180

We're going to have you go through some review exercises.



4

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.110

Let's take a quick overview of what these exercises are.



5

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.600

Your first task is to create a sphere class that accepts a radius upon instantiation and has a volume



6

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.490

and surface area method.



7

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.070

This is going to be quite similar as the circle class you saw in the previous lessons.



8

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.270

However now you're going to need to change some of the formulas instead of the methods for things such



9

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.960

as calculating a volume and calculating a surface area of a sphere.



10

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.850

If you ever need to review what that is.



11

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.070

Go ahead and do a quick Google search for volume or surface area equations of a sphere and the first



12

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.120

results should give you the answer for that.



13

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.660

So once you fill out the methods in this class for sphere you should be able to do something like this.



14

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:01.070

Create a sphere object pass any number then ask for its surface area using a method call as well as



15

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.330

its volume using a method call for exercise 2.



16

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.270

We're going to have several steps here.



17

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.220

Your first job is to create a class called guessing game and it's been created for you here a skeleton.



18

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.590

And we've also imported random for you.



19

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.980

The class doesn't need to use any provided arguments for instantiation.



20

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.110

That is to say you don't need to worry about passing in initial parameters when you actually create



21

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.170

the guessing game.



22

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.780

So you'll see here that we don't need a pass anything for the parameters.



23

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.980

Then next you're going to use the init method to have the class set a self a random choice attribute



24

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.500

and it's going to use the random library to make this attribute a random integer between 0 through 10.



25

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.260

So in the init method the only thing you have to do is a single attribute called self-taught Rand the



26

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.290

choice then you're going to set that equal to a random number using what you know about the random library.



27

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.990

So you can use things like Rand I.A. to create a random integer next you're going to create a method



28

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.170

in the class called Reset random That will reset this random choice attribute so recent random is another



29

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.290

method that will reset the random choice then you're going to create a method called guess.



30

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.790

And the best method is really where the guessing game does most of its logic.



31

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.750

You're going to use the input function in order to take in and accept the use of gas for the random



32

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.590

number.



33

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.360

This method should print out a statement indicating whether or not the user guessed was correct and



34

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.850

as a bonus you can add logic they'll report back to the user to guess higher or lower next time they



35

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.230

call it.



36

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.010

Yes.



37

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.610

So this is an example of what the game should look like if we were to define guessing game.



38

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.730

If we once we define guessing game we can see here we have a random choice attribute.



39

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.540

So you could technically call it and I can reset random.



40

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.990

So if I run this reset random cell and then ask for another random choice you can see it's been reset



41

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.260

to another random number between 0 and 10.



42

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.680

So again these methods are going to be able to do that inside the class.



43

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.170

So you create the class it assigns itself some random choice to this attribute and then you have a method



44

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.640

here that can grab self-taught Rand choice and reset it to some other random number between 0 and 10.



45

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.840

Then you're going to have a guess method and inside that gas method you'll use the input function in



46

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.030

order to initiate a guessing game.



47

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.070

So if I were to run this it would say please input your guess between 0 and 10.



48

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.420

You can see that the correct answer is four.



49

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.440

So let's say I put in six it'll say sorry than a guess correctly guess lower called the guess method



50

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.950

again to try again.



51

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.260

So I'm going to rerun this guess method and then I'm going to guess to say guess higher called the guess



52

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.180

method again to try again.



53

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.250

So let's run it and put the right answer for and then it's going to just say correct guess.



54

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.920

So you're going to create all of this functionality all these methods inside of this class called guessing.



55

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.760

Best of luck in the next lesson.



56

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.370

We'll go over an example solution.
