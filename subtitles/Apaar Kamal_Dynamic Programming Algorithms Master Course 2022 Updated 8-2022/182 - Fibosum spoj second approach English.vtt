00:00.650 --> 00:01.010
I will.

00:01.220 --> 00:02.840
So let's see the second approach.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.870
The other alternative approach of matching the explanation.

00:05.870 --> 00:08.420
Only if you are not able to figure out the.

00:09.790 --> 00:12.130
This one, which is also a nice approach.

00:12.130 --> 00:18.830
It's just based on the property of Columbus, but just let it not be when I get some of this rhythm.

00:18.860 --> 00:19.870
Want to find the sun?

00:20.230 --> 00:22.990
So let's see an example of how to do it.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.870
So firstly, I always do.

00:26.080 --> 00:30.490
I always started by writing some F metric later, later than ever in my.

00:31.570 --> 00:38.650
Metric and this is it's it has some some tilt and turn it as if we were taking them by trend because

00:38.650 --> 00:43.060
some drilling will require for an economy within and it will also require if you've been through an

00:43.060 --> 00:45.610
equitable and minus rate now.

00:46.630 --> 00:49.060
What is the next metric that we can have?

00:49.120 --> 00:53.980
So if I multiply it to a metric into this fine metric, I should get an F and plus one metric.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.790
So just replacing and Y and plus one or more.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.830
Should I get as in plus one f and plus one.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.410
Even minus Rite Aid.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.280
So this was.

01:07.630 --> 01:09.820
But yeah, this should be f.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.820
And not even minus one I'm replacing.

01:13.820 --> 01:15.430
And why and plus one, right.

01:15.870 --> 01:22.190
So now again is religious bigotry metric, which is very you know, because I have to use these three

01:22.190 --> 01:28.880
things to make the simplest one what for readers and brethren inherited it is Essen plus F and plus

01:28.880 --> 01:32.840
one some tool and plus one term right.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.790
Which is Sunderland Templar seven plus one.

01:35.690 --> 01:36.740
How will this will be?

01:36.800 --> 01:38.180
It is very easy.

01:38.180 --> 01:40.880
F and plus one is it goes to F and reserve in minus eight.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.070
So basically did the sum of all three.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.600
Right and the next to me and plus one.

01:46.610 --> 01:47.220
So what did happen.

01:47.240 --> 01:51.950
Plus one it is F in plus a friend minus one.

01:51.990 --> 01:52.320
Right.

01:52.490 --> 01:57.020
Which is nothing but some of both the lower Adam's and the last one is.

01:58.130 --> 02:03.100
Evan, I want to just find no different, which is does this cross diagonal eight.

02:03.230 --> 02:06.740
So this is the thematics that's prepared for me for this particular F matrix.

02:06.740 --> 02:09.160
And this is F and plus one metric ladies.

02:09.680 --> 02:10.010
So.

02:11.980 --> 02:12.250
Yeah.

02:13.280 --> 02:17.510
Let me just quickly share an example why it will work.

02:17.840 --> 02:22.820
So the metrics is 111011010.

02:23.450 --> 02:23.690
Right.

02:24.020 --> 02:24.650
So let's see.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.030
This metric is the base.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.320
Let's make a base case.

02:27.830 --> 02:28.910
We have n minus one here.

02:28.910 --> 02:29.240
Right.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.340
So let's make the basic need to replace.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.350
And by one, we will.

02:33.350 --> 02:40.370
So this becomes f one, which is some till quantum is one because f in is one and F in minus one is

02:40.370 --> 02:40.670
zero.

02:42.470 --> 02:47.270
So what will be the multiplication of these two mattresses, sort of B one plus one, two.

02:47.780 --> 02:49.970
And the next will be one here only.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.950
And the last one will be zero.

02:53.990 --> 02:56.330
I hope the last one will not be zero.

02:56.330 --> 02:58.070
It will be this one into this one.

02:58.430 --> 03:00.860
It will be one eight.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.390
But this is the.

03:03.820 --> 03:10.720
F and plus one which is F2 matrix and this contains S2 bundle two terms offered when accurate, which

03:10.720 --> 03:11.680
is feedback is zero plus.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.310
We want to keep one.

03:12.490 --> 03:15.670
We're going to in Q2, which is zero plus one plus when it is true.

03:15.970 --> 03:16.810
I hope you got this.

03:16.990 --> 03:22.900
And again, if you multiply the three metrics with F2, let's see if I multiplied t matrix with F2 or

03:22.900 --> 03:24.460
delete, I get F3.

03:24.940 --> 03:29.690
You can try this will bullet squirted out quickly and yeah.

03:29.990 --> 03:33.370
So this is just some previous code and let me just remove this.

03:34.330 --> 03:35.590
I wouldn't change anything.

03:35.590 --> 03:39.010
We were here in the matrix structure and I just yeah.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.660
So this is the function, if you will.

03:40.660 --> 03:45.130
Some will pass and do it and it will give me the sum of the atom.

03:46.020 --> 03:46.500
Will this.

03:47.540 --> 03:48.080
So.

03:48.080 --> 03:48.390
Yeah.

03:51.970 --> 03:52.810
Let me.

03:54.500 --> 03:54.710
Hmm.

03:55.370 --> 03:55.610
Yeah.

03:56.990 --> 04:02.120
So let's see out here, Blossom, and we want to find out some detail.

04:02.120 --> 04:07.660
Amsterdam minus Bobo, some tail and minus one down eight.

04:07.850 --> 04:10.460
So here we can see that and is and can also be zero.

04:11.120 --> 04:14.730
That means and minus one can also be negative, which is minus eight.

04:14.810 --> 04:18.140
So let's write some base cases, which is very simple.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.110
If end is minus one, written zero.

04:22.290 --> 04:22.590
Right.

04:22.950 --> 04:23.890
If and zero.

04:24.390 --> 04:27.480
What is the subwoofer when I get zero rated also zero.

04:28.020 --> 04:29.040
And if fairness.

04:30.100 --> 04:30.490
One.

04:30.880 --> 04:31.990
Then let's return one.

04:33.020 --> 04:34.460
Well, let's return these three values.

04:34.490 --> 04:35.930
Now we know that.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.190
And is greater than equal to two.

04:38.760 --> 04:43.740
So here, let me try that and is greater than equal to two right now.

04:43.980 --> 04:46.500
We have a detergent matrix that we used to have.

04:46.830 --> 04:48.920
This is the thematic that I have to make.

04:48.930 --> 04:51.000
So the thematic is one when one in the first.

04:51.000 --> 04:51.270
True.

04:51.580 --> 04:52.670
But do you not m.

04:54.480 --> 05:03.690
Zero zero is equals 22.01 equals 23.02 is a goes to one.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.790
So fill the first row with one.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.460
And also you can see that the sizes three.

05:08.460 --> 05:11.930
Now that means all the emergency there will be of regrowth.

05:11.940 --> 05:16.030
38i hope you won't get confused aerators.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.450
You can increase or decrease the site as you want to.

05:19.700 --> 05:24.100
And the second row is zeroes on the second part.

05:24.110 --> 05:25.820
So let me quickly move.

05:25.820 --> 05:28.730
This would be zero one and zero two is one.

05:28.910 --> 05:32.030
And the third one, we have it in just the middle part.

05:32.780 --> 05:35.900
Let me remove this and let me also remove.

05:38.960 --> 05:39.320
Right.

05:39.560 --> 05:42.680
So as you can see, we have the zero zero.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.120
Otherwise everyone will be.

05:44.990 --> 05:47.510
We have these ones and everything else will be zero.

05:48.020 --> 05:50.760
Now, this is the base case, right?

05:50.870 --> 05:52.760
So in the base case, I can.

05:53.270 --> 05:53.570
Yeah.

05:53.690 --> 05:55.160
So any greater than or equal to two now.

05:55.910 --> 06:00.800
Basically, if I let's see if I pass and it goes straight to here, what will happen?

06:02.650 --> 06:03.460
It won't go here.

06:03.820 --> 06:04.120
You'll.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.410
It this willful knowledge.

06:08.430 --> 06:11.360
And as he goes to do so, this value will go to name.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.420
So it will mean meaning.

06:13.430 --> 06:16.250
It will try to find quiet of it.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.440
Basically, it will find these square.

06:19.400 --> 06:26.570
Into whatever the base and multiplying rates of the base case here is nothing but this which is 110,

06:26.570 --> 06:27.410
which is F1.

06:28.160 --> 06:28.330
Right.

06:28.610 --> 06:33.710
So I'm trying to multiply the F1 would be square, but that should not happen because these going into

06:33.710 --> 06:36.830
everyone will give me F3 and will not give F2.

06:37.160 --> 06:37.390
Right.

06:37.670 --> 06:44.140
So if I'm passing and as to here let me subtract and by one and minus equals 2.8.

06:44.660 --> 06:46.070
Why am I subjecting and by.

06:46.790 --> 06:53.330
Because if an is being possessed I just want to find out it restricted power and minus four and not

06:53.330 --> 07:00.710
be the power in those days to the power and minus one into the base cases giving F2 and not F1.

07:01.370 --> 07:02.270
I hope you got this.

07:03.130 --> 07:03.790
But this is.

07:04.670 --> 07:07.240
We are just subtracting one because.

07:07.510 --> 07:12.190
Because let me also quickly write this because he is quite everyone is 83.

07:13.260 --> 07:18.120
But every the rich will give some third rate similarity.

07:18.300 --> 07:21.350
Cube f1 is f or right.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.360
Well basically if necessary then we are getting food.

07:24.390 --> 07:24.840
And so.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.420
But we want parents rich.

07:26.460 --> 07:29.430
I'm just subtracting and buy one so that we can get the third answer.

07:30.060 --> 07:30.900
I hope that's fine.

07:31.380 --> 07:35.250
Now, after this, we have found out that there is this de matrixes.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.280
We have honored the deeds to the Bible and minus one.

07:39.670 --> 07:43.330
And after I founded the deeds to the boat and minus one, what I can do is.

07:45.050 --> 07:52.130
I just have to multiply the first row with the first column of the F because I just want a center right

07:52.730 --> 07:53.000
here.

07:53.420 --> 07:54.440
I just want the center.

07:55.030 --> 07:58.790
I just multiply the first row with the with this column, which is 110.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.560
But indirectly, what will happen?

08:01.950 --> 08:04.200
This will get multiplied by this.

08:04.230 --> 08:09.630
This will get multiplied by this rate and this will get multiplied by this.

08:10.110 --> 08:14.040
Basically, F and minus one is zero because of the base case.

08:14.070 --> 08:14.340
Okay.

08:14.340 --> 08:17.970
Let me limit it to basically this is to the bar with something.

08:17.970 --> 08:20.790
Let's let me call it key into the base case.

08:20.790 --> 08:21.600
What was the base case?

08:21.600 --> 08:22.470
110.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.590
We know the first rule will get multiplied by the sum.

08:25.590 --> 08:27.990
So let me write first row as ABC rate.

08:28.170 --> 08:31.920
So it will be in two one plus being two one plus seen to zero.

08:32.250 --> 08:37.920
We are not considering see what we do is we'll say into one plus being doing rate which is nothing but

08:38.220 --> 08:45.390
these are rendered m00e and is rendered m01, which is b I'm not taking the third value because if I

08:45.390 --> 08:48.150
take this R value, I say this, let's say zero one.

08:48.420 --> 08:55.290
Do I have to multiply by zero rate the base in the base case we we saw that it's zero the F in metric.

08:56.550 --> 08:57.660
We will not multiply this.

08:58.760 --> 09:02.480
And finally we'll take mode and attendee values.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.040
I hope this works.

09:04.070 --> 09:05.510
Let me build this quickly.

09:08.190 --> 09:08.380
Yeah.

09:13.690 --> 09:13.950
Okay.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.100
It's too.

09:16.270 --> 09:17.200
008.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.370
So let me quickly go over this again.

09:20.380 --> 09:21.360
I don't think so.

09:21.370 --> 09:22.390
There should be an error.

09:23.540 --> 09:24.590
This is the key metric.

09:24.610 --> 09:28.940
The metric is 0110121.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.580
And zero one.

09:32.450 --> 09:32.630
Okay.

09:32.770 --> 09:32.970
Okay.

09:32.970 --> 09:33.170
Okay.

09:33.170 --> 09:35.630
So this is the first two eight in the first row.

09:35.630 --> 09:38.240
It should be one one and in the second should be two one.

09:38.570 --> 09:38.980
My red.

09:40.690 --> 09:42.280
Right now we are seeing good numbers.

09:42.760 --> 09:43.180
My word.

09:43.180 --> 09:46.150
Sorry, guys, because in the first story, it should be one day.

09:46.180 --> 09:49.780
I just copy paste and it always happens with me whenever I copy paste things.

09:50.970 --> 09:54.720
So here what we have we have four then and yeah.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.720
So it will still not work quite because it m subtracting rate.

09:57.900 --> 09:59.550
Let's say the numbers are huge.

09:59.910 --> 10:04.410
If I subtract them they will not give me the right number because of the modulus properties.

10:04.890 --> 10:05.790
I simply lose.

10:05.790 --> 10:06.630
I will add more.

10:07.830 --> 10:09.570
And then I again ignored.

10:10.780 --> 10:14.740
And then they should give me the overdoses as these numbers were small.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.090
So it was giving me the right answer.

10:16.100 --> 10:20.170
But I just remember this is more or less probably don't ever forget this if you're subject.

10:20.860 --> 10:25.450
So there was a time when I was giving some long talent and it took me two days to realize this because

10:25.690 --> 10:31.870
at the time I was on YouTube programming, no one was going to tell this part to me, and it took two

10:31.870 --> 10:34.300
days to figure out that it might just be smart.

10:35.620 --> 10:38.380
It might not be if I want to more, it should be A-minus.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.940
B-plus more than Hallmark eight.

10:42.180 --> 10:42.420
Yeah.

10:42.750 --> 10:46.920
And we can simply submit this word as well on this page and.

10:48.520 --> 10:49.090
To the.
