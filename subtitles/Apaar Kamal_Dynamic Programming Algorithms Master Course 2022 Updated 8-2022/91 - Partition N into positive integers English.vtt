00:00.410 --> 00:01.100
Hello, everyone.

00:01.230 --> 00:01.730
Welcome.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.490
And you will see a very interesting problem.

00:05.060 --> 00:07.160
It is fairly interesting problem because.

00:08.920 --> 00:13.090
There are some issues that we missing this problem.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.880
And so let's discuss this.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.020
So the problem is very simple.

00:17.020 --> 00:23.740
Find a number of ways to partition and in positive integers you will see two parts of this problem.

00:23.740 --> 00:25.150
The first part of the problem is.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.070
Those are ordered.

00:29.850 --> 00:30.100
Right.

00:30.450 --> 00:32.700
And the second part is those are unordered.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.410
It's okay.

00:34.590 --> 00:40.360
So can we see that in the first part, the order matters.

00:40.380 --> 00:45.550
And in the second part, the order does not matter at all.

00:46.020 --> 00:50.940
But let's take an example and let's see what's for one.

00:51.660 --> 00:58.350
If I and it goes to one, then of course I cannot do this one, only I can't partition it into more

00:58.500 --> 00:59.280
extreme integers.

01:00.090 --> 01:07.230
Similarly, for an order to an ordered bit and if end is equal to two, I can do this one plus one.

01:07.870 --> 01:12.180
Similarly, in an order we can edit as one best fun and I can do this loop.

01:13.260 --> 01:17.760
That means I'm partitioning a positive number into other positive numbers.

01:18.720 --> 01:23.520
It's it stock this forward and it goes to three of what any construed three word I have.

01:24.940 --> 01:27.160
I have one plus one plus one.

01:28.330 --> 01:31.720
So in order to say it's what we say, we say the dead are the matters.

01:31.950 --> 01:32.260
Right.

01:32.680 --> 01:33.850
And it means that.

01:36.350 --> 01:39.440
You realize in this we can advertise one plus two.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.160
We can also write readers who blaspheme.

01:42.260 --> 01:43.700
That means there are other matters.

01:44.120 --> 01:48.380
So if there are two murders, one plus two is different.

01:49.010 --> 01:50.300
Eight are instead of me.

01:50.300 --> 01:52.310
Let me say it is not equal to two plus one.

01:53.510 --> 01:56.390
Because here the order of these numbers matter.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.870
So that's why this problem is an interesting problem.

02:00.650 --> 02:01.700
So it divides.

02:02.730 --> 02:03.750
Things into two parts.

02:04.590 --> 02:06.260
And the last one is the.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.540
But for the unordered base, what we can do is one plus one plus one.

02:09.840 --> 02:14.570
I can write it as one plus two, because in an order, part of an order does not matter.

02:14.570 --> 02:14.840
Right.

02:15.060 --> 02:17.850
But one, one plus two is same as two plus one entry.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.630
I hope you are getting the whole point of ordered and ordered.

02:22.110 --> 02:22.770
We give some.

02:23.900 --> 02:29.720
I have a very good follow up problem lined up and which is A-Rod getting problem, which is another

02:30.050 --> 02:32.240
very famous interesting problem ain't.

02:33.250 --> 02:36.640
The trials following this alleged drug war.

02:36.640 --> 02:37.480
And it goes to Fort.

02:37.930 --> 02:44.080
Now, what we'll do is we'll try to make a recursive relation here in terms of altered states and then

02:44.080 --> 02:48.550
see that how does that relation follow before and it goes to four.

02:48.550 --> 02:49.750
What I can do is I can.

02:52.210 --> 02:53.650
Let's take the first case for one.

02:53.890 --> 02:55.990
It's I'm doing one and then I'm writing.

02:55.990 --> 02:59.260
All the peers of that are possible.

02:59.260 --> 02:59.590
Right?

02:59.890 --> 03:00.640
Let me write them.

03:00.640 --> 03:10.060
It is one plus one plus one plus one, one, one plus two, one plus two plus one and one plus three.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.150
So I've got this forward.

03:12.160 --> 03:15.400
I've just added one before them and written all of them.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.980
But it is very simple.

03:16.990 --> 03:19.480
It is nothing but three plus one, four, eight.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.450
Now let's, let's have a second set, which is two.

03:22.830 --> 03:27.580
What I'll do is if I have if I already have some two plus something, then what should did something

03:27.580 --> 03:28.210
be it?

03:28.210 --> 03:36.220
Should we find out the number of these in which I cannot do as a sum of positive and digit, but it

03:36.220 --> 03:40.250
will be two plus one plus one and two plus two.

03:40.810 --> 03:42.040
I will getting the whole point.

03:42.040 --> 03:42.710
Two eight.

03:42.910 --> 03:44.590
Next will be if I'm writing three.

03:45.550 --> 03:49.570
Let's see if the the partitioning starts from three.

03:49.570 --> 03:54.650
Then what happens if the partitioning starting from three then what I have is I have just one number

03:54.890 --> 03:57.460
which is one, I just simply add one over here.

03:57.730 --> 03:59.650
And finally I have four eight.

04:00.070 --> 04:00.300
So.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.500
This is for three and this is for four.

04:03.780 --> 04:10.560
So here you can see, how can I easily for America's revelation in this case that f often is equal to

04:12.060 --> 04:13.140
let me write it?

04:15.130 --> 04:17.290
Our targeting problem.

04:19.650 --> 04:19.880
But.

04:20.750 --> 04:24.440
So here you can easily see that everything is equal to what?

04:25.880 --> 04:32.960
If I'm partitioning into one plus something else that is nothing but F in minus one eight.

04:32.990 --> 04:36.100
That means that the number of ways of partitioning F in minus one.

04:36.110 --> 04:41.270
So here in this case it was always eight and I just added one in front of them.

04:41.270 --> 04:47.810
So I have four different ways of writing and it goes to four eight by using three rule.

04:48.840 --> 04:49.290
Let's.

04:50.660 --> 04:51.050
Right.

04:52.050 --> 04:59.340
To find out how many whether are partitioning to let's see how many we are there of partitioning to

04:59.340 --> 05:01.230
the and so on L and minus.

05:02.480 --> 05:07.550
And that means write for and find out how many ways are there by listening zero, which will be great.

05:08.610 --> 05:11.420
So I hope we're getting the whole point over here.

05:12.710 --> 05:16.030
So this is nothing but effort is nothing but a mission of.

05:16.730 --> 05:22.820
Let's say Emmy goes to one to end and f off and minus and.

05:23.960 --> 05:31.120
We have got our records in relation in India, in this case, in the ordered peer case where the order

05:31.120 --> 05:34.570
matters, the one plus two is different from two plus one.

05:34.650 --> 05:35.470
They were no.

05:35.470 --> 05:37.060
Let's talk about this unordered.

05:39.250 --> 05:40.320
You know, an audit case.

05:41.430 --> 05:44.010
There are some good things that will happen.

05:44.130 --> 05:44.380
Right.

05:44.610 --> 05:51.210
Because I hear you can see the one plus one plus two is different from two plus one plus one kind of.

05:52.240 --> 05:52.990
We have to win.

05:52.990 --> 05:54.190
We have won and we have won.

05:54.490 --> 05:58.990
But they are considered different and it is also considered different as one plus two plus five, but

05:58.990 --> 06:03.190
in an ordered will consider all of them to be simple.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.230
What we will do is.

06:06.420 --> 06:09.450
You make an order said we will try to.

06:10.660 --> 06:14.080
Have a fixed pattern and that fixed pattern.

06:14.260 --> 06:16.480
I have to say, you're going to see your own pattern here.

06:16.720 --> 06:23.050
Where the pattern ended, I've decided, is that if I am writing it as a sum of some digits, then it

06:23.050 --> 06:25.510
will always be in an increasing order.

06:27.090 --> 06:30.180
So if it always be in increasing order, then what will happen?

06:30.390 --> 06:33.000
Let's let's take the example of these three.

06:34.670 --> 06:37.700
So if these are always in increasing order, then it will be.

06:37.700 --> 06:43.850
One reason as to this will also be one plus one Bristol because 112 rate and similarly this will also

06:43.850 --> 06:45.080
be one plus one plus two.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.640
In this case, what will happen?

06:46.640 --> 06:49.910
All three of them will be considered as one only rate.

06:50.180 --> 06:51.380
That's why what I'm saying is.

06:52.450 --> 06:58.270
I will try and formulate the partitions on the basis of an increasing order.

06:58.870 --> 07:00.100
Only that will help me.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.140
Because right now.

07:03.850 --> 07:04.140
Yeah.

07:04.150 --> 07:08.230
So if I'll have them in increasing order will get all of them as a unit values.

07:08.230 --> 07:10.930
It will not get duplicates in some orders.

07:11.590 --> 07:12.160
So.

07:13.580 --> 07:13.860
Yeah.

07:13.910 --> 07:15.580
So we have one pool.

07:15.770 --> 07:17.000
Then we'll have, uh.

07:17.510 --> 07:17.750
Okay.

07:17.750 --> 07:18.650
So we have one plus one.

07:18.650 --> 07:19.520
Plus one plus one.

07:19.910 --> 07:22.190
As I said, they have to be in an increasing order.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.670
So one plus one is an increasing order.

07:25.670 --> 07:27.650
So it is greater than equal to.

07:27.650 --> 07:32.420
That means if I'm writing a term M, it can be greater than or equal to n eight.

07:33.360 --> 07:38.610
So in this case, by using this, we'll just avoid some duplicates to last.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.700
So now we can edit as 1.128.

07:41.970 --> 07:43.530
We can edit this one plus three.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.980
We can also write it is two plus two.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.560
As you can see, all of them are in an order.

07:50.580 --> 07:52.410
All of them are in increasing orders.

07:53.390 --> 07:57.170
And last enteritidis to replace one case?

07:57.620 --> 07:58.400
No, because.

07:59.460 --> 08:03.870
As you can see the order it is not in increasing order three is greater than one and three is coming

08:03.870 --> 08:04.350
before one.

08:04.350 --> 08:08.730
So that's we don't want that right because we want an ordered pair of six.

08:09.210 --> 08:09.430
Right.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.990
And after this, what will happen will have finally four.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.590
How many possibilities are there for an equal to four.

08:16.590 --> 08:20.070
And if I want an ordered six, the order does not matter.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.140
I have five different possible.

08:23.570 --> 08:30.050
I know this can be slightly tricky for most of us because this can be a good question.

08:30.820 --> 08:35.780
Like they tell me how many auditors are there and tell me how many on order checks are there and how

08:35.780 --> 08:36.770
will you figure it out?

08:38.110 --> 08:42.100
Well, some of you might be wondering that how will we code this thing?

08:42.120 --> 08:44.100
How will we code the unordered power of things?

08:44.670 --> 08:50.400
And how will we be divided into some increasing number of numbers?

08:50.730 --> 08:51.990
And that is also very easy.

08:52.950 --> 08:58.050
So in the next lecture, what we'll do is we'll code both of them, and then we will see that how to

08:58.050 --> 08:59.700
call it in an increasing order.

09:00.240 --> 09:05.640
So in that case, what will what I'll do is I'll just have an extra variable called Min eight or let's

09:05.640 --> 09:06.360
call it minimum.

09:06.720 --> 09:11.190
And whenever I'm trying to partition a number, I will try to partition the number into.

09:12.310 --> 09:20.230
A partition which is greater than minimum to get in the next part so that it becomes very easy.
