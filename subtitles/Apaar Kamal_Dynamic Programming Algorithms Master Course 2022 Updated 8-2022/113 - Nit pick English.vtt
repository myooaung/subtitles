00:00.360 --> 00:00.720
Okay.

1
00:00.720 --> 00:02.460
So, again, I made a very small thing.

2
00:03.860 --> 00:07.240
We all know we have to take mod whenever we are calculating answer.

3
00:07.520 --> 00:10.910
Otherwise, it will overflow from my.

4
00:11.220 --> 00:13.420
integer value, or the long, long value we have taken.

5
00:14.510 --> 00:15.050
So just.

6
00:15.900 --> 00:19.170
take mod wherever you are writing something to the answer.

7
00:22.830 --> 00:23.280
Now.

8
00:23.340 --> 00:25.860
It's a perfect solution, sorry for this again.
