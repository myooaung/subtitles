00:00.800 --> 00:01.250
All right.

00:01.310 --> 00:04.370
So let's go to this quickly here.

00:04.370 --> 00:06.050
I already have this.

00:07.250 --> 00:08.460
Heavier duty streams.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.270
Let me quickly take them as one who.

00:12.440 --> 00:12.670
Be.

00:14.040 --> 00:14.790
S1.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.050
S2.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.150
S.

00:18.330 --> 00:23.760
But history and Agincourt isn't to leave.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.320
S1 S2.

00:27.960 --> 00:28.830
You're passing the trees.

00:29.660 --> 00:34.700
Well, so what I'll do is I'll simply say to 20 3000 and let's write this deep.

00:35.350 --> 00:42.960
Well, what's the what are the two what are the things that we saw at the S1 will be equal to S3 or

00:42.960 --> 00:45.510
S2 will be equal to 38 the characters.

00:45.750 --> 00:51.450
So what I can simply say is if I use less before moving this, when we need to handle the spatial case,

00:51.450 --> 00:57.330
if it's rendered size less, student size is not equal to s.

00:58.580 --> 00:59.060
You don't.

01:00.450 --> 01:00.720
Face.

01:01.530 --> 01:02.040
Al Jazeera.

01:02.040 --> 01:02.990
Dan Balz.

01:04.940 --> 01:05.360
And.

01:07.180 --> 01:13.500
Now, if all this is a recall, then we can apply DP And let's go this device less than as one rendered

01:13.510 --> 01:14.020
size.

01:15.030 --> 01:18.720
And S1, i.e. is equal to S3.

01:19.120 --> 01:19.350
Okay.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.350
So as you can see, I'm passing here with you.

01:22.380 --> 01:23.910
But it's actually not needed.

01:23.940 --> 01:27.020
What you can do is you can always see is equal to A-plus.

01:28.110 --> 01:33.590
I think you were getting my point when I meant that gay is not an independent variable dependent variable.

01:33.600 --> 01:37.200
So here I can remove and zero will be leaves when I need.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.180
It goes to a three key then.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.660
Let me simply say.

01:41.710 --> 01:47.260
Answer is zero and answers are equals to epi, i.e. less one.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.000
Yeah, it is.

01:49.010 --> 01:50.410
And it will be fun.

01:50.420 --> 01:52.520
But it doesn't matter if I plus one is there.

01:52.790 --> 01:54.290
In the next time what will happen?

01:54.300 --> 01:58.130
K will automatically be equal to Kate plus one because it is equal to eight plus.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.390
I hope you're getting this.

02:00.870 --> 02:08.310
And what's the second guess if you use less, then as to the size and as you get.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.970
Is it close to a three year?

02:13.260 --> 02:14.220
Then what we can do.

02:14.340 --> 02:17.160
We can simply say answers or requests to DP.

02:17.730 --> 02:18.900
I got my zipless.

02:20.340 --> 02:23.010
Fine because now S2 is matching with S3.

02:23.340 --> 02:26.220
We are seeing the rest of the string and now go in match.

02:27.690 --> 02:27.960
Right.

02:28.390 --> 02:35.070
So which of if any of these two matches it will be true and it will it the answer, let's say the base

02:35.070 --> 02:36.210
case is if.

02:36.210 --> 02:36.540
Ah.

02:36.780 --> 02:37.070
Yeah.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.340
So the base case is simple.

02:38.400 --> 02:46.850
If K equals two as three dot size, that means if I were able to read the end and you would also read

02:47.490 --> 02:53.010
it because we already know now that as, as well as we discussed with three, let's say eighth grade

02:53.010 --> 03:01.400
and then assimilated into these and these things are there to match they'd addres let's say if I his

03:01.400 --> 03:05.850
these the end then it would never call this it will itself call the second portion.

03:06.300 --> 03:10.620
If J has reached the end of S two, that means it will never call this.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.750
It will automatically call the first function.

03:12.930 --> 03:15.090
We don't have to handle any other thing.

03:15.540 --> 03:16.680
All of it is not here.

03:18.060 --> 03:20.850
Now, there's only one thing that is clear and it is memorization.

03:21.920 --> 03:22.220
Wait.

03:22.730 --> 03:23.940
So what?

03:24.380 --> 03:27.750
Yeah, I can direct it and I just have to resize it.

03:28.240 --> 03:31.070
But let me quickly say that memo, Daldry says.

03:33.370 --> 03:40.940
And yeah so I'm I'm trying to memorize on the basis of I enjoy only I'm not taking care because you

03:40.990 --> 03:47.260
know they that Graceland will be do I pledge you if I take IEEE committee as my musician partner then

03:47.260 --> 03:52.030
it would be a little too much and it will be more than I enjoy the most.

03:52.450 --> 03:55.330
My list beer is I enjoy it.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.350
So let me quickly discuss.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.080
Let's say I spend outside.

04:01.350 --> 04:04.050
Plus one comma, this vector.

04:06.150 --> 04:07.830
And let's fill the columns there.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.690
It will be a the size.

04:11.610 --> 04:15.480
Less one and communism ended with minus one eight.

04:16.110 --> 04:18.390
What I will simply do is I will simply say if memo.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.340
In an article.

04:21.330 --> 04:23.400
And return memo.

04:24.380 --> 04:28.560
What I believe now is that some of you might not be looking at coding videos.

04:28.790 --> 04:33.860
You can or you can yourself quote this so you can skip recording videos if you are able to call yourself.

04:35.030 --> 04:36.890
Because I have to take care of everyone.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.110
So it's fine if you're able to call it yourself.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.290
It is not equal to this.

04:42.470 --> 04:42.980
To this.

04:42.980 --> 04:45.980
Otherwise they would.

04:47.850 --> 04:50.520
I've saved it here and let me build this.

04:52.990 --> 04:53.250
Okay.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.250
Something is wrong.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.160
You go and declare a heretic.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.470
And then you should be history.

05:00.590 --> 05:01.670
Any other mistake?

05:01.790 --> 05:02.000
No.

05:02.060 --> 05:03.200
So here I am, getting one.

05:03.230 --> 05:04.850
That means, yes, they are solvable.

05:05.450 --> 05:06.350
But the complexity.

05:06.690 --> 05:08.600
Complexity is how many states are there?

05:08.600 --> 05:09.410
How many states are there?

05:09.410 --> 05:14.990
I entered it there did this window to say the industrial base, which is how much?

05:15.830 --> 05:18.310
Hundred and 200 or to its fullest.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.200
No event through GDP would ever do that.

05:21.200 --> 05:21.350
Is.

05:21.350 --> 05:22.530
Are you to June to.

05:24.210 --> 05:26.830
You can see rain the eye into June.

05:26.850 --> 05:27.600
The cake would have.

05:29.130 --> 05:29.580
What are you?

05:30.710 --> 05:37.580
Will Grace see this follow problem that it is could use, albeit using only astronaut length additional

05:37.580 --> 05:38.180
memory space?

05:38.510 --> 05:39.410
Yes, we can solve it.

05:39.740 --> 05:47.510
We already know that they state that there's this IPS intersection in the same course where I have about

05:47.510 --> 05:49.970
how to reduce memory complexity.

05:50.450 --> 05:56.600
By using that technique, you can reduce this and use a very little memory.

05:57.870 --> 05:58.110
Well.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.390
Oh, great.

06:00.870 --> 06:02.250
I hope there are no more doubts.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.410
Even I imagine it could have worked.

06:04.590 --> 06:07.760
But we know that dependent variable it can be derived from my India.

06:08.010 --> 06:09.750
We don't have to memorize on the basis of.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.300
Thank you, everyone.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.200
Soon, the next part.
