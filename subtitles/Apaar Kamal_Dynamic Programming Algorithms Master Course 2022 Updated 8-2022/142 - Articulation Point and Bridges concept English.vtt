WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:01.020
Okay.

00:01.020 --> 00:10.470
So let's understand how key how is the lowest related to finding articulation by intimidated?

00:10.710 --> 00:11.760
How is it helping us?

00:12.870 --> 00:13.860
Why did its use.

00:14.520 --> 00:15.540
Well so.

00:17.120 --> 00:21.740
Let's understand this by some normal example or an example.

00:21.740 --> 00:22.880
It's a visualization.

00:23.060 --> 00:27.170
I just want you to understand this visualization, because there can be numerous examples.

00:27.170 --> 00:27.370
Right.

00:27.410 --> 00:31.220
But all those examples can be easily related to this visualization.

00:31.310 --> 00:32.060
I wanted to show you.

00:32.600 --> 00:32.830
Okay.

00:33.230 --> 00:33.570
Okay.

00:34.580 --> 00:40.250
I'm not I'm like, I can do a lot of animation and stuff and also teach you by the same method.

00:40.580 --> 00:42.380
But I don't believe in all those things.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.790
I believe in simplicity.

00:43.790 --> 00:48.830
If you keep things simple and you give the best you have, then I think you can easily understand a

00:48.830 --> 00:51.050
lot of topics.

00:51.240 --> 00:55.550
Well, so first of all, let's say I was on some road node.

00:58.340 --> 00:58.640
Yeah.

00:58.670 --> 01:00.950
So initially, I wasn't, um, neutered.

01:01.240 --> 01:01.490
Right.

01:01.790 --> 01:02.960
And I traversed.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.210
Traversed, traversed with some not into.

01:06.560 --> 01:14.210
And I'm already like, fine, I've already figured out what is discovery of current and what is lowest

01:14.210 --> 01:15.050
off current.

01:15.580 --> 01:17.120
I have these two values with me.

01:21.090 --> 01:21.270
Off.

01:21.680 --> 01:22.080
I didn't.

01:23.510 --> 01:24.180
We discovered.

01:27.660 --> 01:30.140
Discovered of it.

01:30.690 --> 01:33.840
So this is the last thing that we are discussing in our relation points in bridges.

01:33.840 --> 01:39.300
After this, like after this only code will be left to understand nothing else.

01:40.260 --> 01:41.400
So after this will go.

01:42.010 --> 01:46.680
So right now I'm talking about a relationship between a current node and it.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.240
So let's say X.

01:49.470 --> 01:52.550
It can have managers x, y, z.

01:52.830 --> 01:53.650
Many, right.

01:54.030 --> 01:56.700
But right now I'm just talking about one of its site.

01:57.030 --> 01:59.430
I'm talking about the soul guarding the Knicks.

02:00.150 --> 02:00.420
Well.

02:02.090 --> 02:02.420
Okay.

02:02.420 --> 02:08.270
So we will also be doing what is our discovery of X and we will also be doing what is the lowest of

02:08.270 --> 02:15.410
X, what is the lowest of x mean that if I go in the subtree of x, if I keep going this arbitrary of

02:15.410 --> 02:17.240
x, then how far?

02:18.520 --> 02:19.030
Above.

02:19.960 --> 02:20.500
Can I go?

02:21.440 --> 02:21.740
Right.

02:22.280 --> 02:28.280
The guys here will be only talking about two dumbs that is like, listen very properly because it's

02:28.280 --> 02:31.190
very easy and I don't want you to skip anything.

02:32.430 --> 02:35.400
So here we'll be talking about Lewis traffic's.

02:38.750 --> 02:39.700
What is Lewis to fix?

02:40.520 --> 02:44.750
If I start from x and go downwards, then what is the least?

02:44.750 --> 02:46.400
Because it's going to take me above.

02:47.150 --> 02:52.820
And what is the back of that thinking that can take me as much as possible.

02:53.150 --> 02:53.420
Right.

02:53.660 --> 02:54.560
So it is law of X.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.300
Case law fixes the term that I've already described.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.570
And we'll be talking about the second term called Discovery of Current.

03:03.260 --> 03:09.650
Only these two terms will be compared to find our articulation point simply state law of X and discovery

03:09.650 --> 03:10.520
of current state.

03:11.060 --> 03:14.660
So they tell me if law of X.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.080
That is the first guess I'm digging.

03:20.180 --> 03:25.910
But for right now, we are we are focusing on figuring out whether it is a bridge or not.

03:27.570 --> 03:28.140
Bridget.

03:28.930 --> 03:32.820
But at this age, between current and this child is a bridge, age or not.

03:33.270 --> 03:35.010
Are they not figuring this out?

03:35.250 --> 03:37.300
It is a bridge or what is a bridge?

03:37.300 --> 03:43.740
This guy's quickly realizing that if I remove this as it will be divided into more connected components,

03:44.310 --> 03:47.400
and if I remove this edge, that means gate.

03:47.850 --> 03:53.850
And if it is a bridge, if it is a bridge, then we can easily notice that low of x.

03:55.340 --> 03:58.580
Low affects should be greater than the discovery of current.

04:00.980 --> 04:01.230
Days.

04:02.270 --> 04:04.430
They pause the video for a moment and think about it.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.960
If I start from this decision.

04:10.520 --> 04:10.790
Yeah.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.640
If I start from subtree of x.

04:15.160 --> 04:18.370
And I am able to like remain in the subtree of x.

04:19.840 --> 04:20.940
There's the meaning of it now.

04:20.970 --> 04:24.340
Kilo loaf x is greater than discovery of current.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.970
The lowest, the lowest I am, which I can go to.

04:27.970 --> 04:31.030
It is greater than the discovered time of the current node.

04:32.530 --> 04:37.840
So if this is the case, that means the edge between eggs and current is a bridge.

04:39.280 --> 04:39.530
Why?

04:39.640 --> 04:48.070
Yes, because if I'm starting from X going downwards and I cannot traverse some variable current, I'm

04:48.070 --> 04:52.720
not I can't there was not even a delta current, not even to current.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.810
I'm not able to traverse above X.

04:55.810 --> 04:56.540
Basically.

04:56.560 --> 05:03.870
That means if I remove this edge, then this complete portion, the complete subtree of x will be disconnected,

05:04.600 --> 05:04.900
right?

05:05.110 --> 05:11.560
So if the complete subtree of x will be disconnected, that means the whole subtree of x will give me

05:11.560 --> 05:15.150
a new connected component and that will determine Brigitte.

05:16.070 --> 05:16.570
Ladies.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.140
And now let's figure it out.

05:21.160 --> 05:21.850
What if?

05:23.050 --> 05:29.710
So let's see this case when lieu of X is greater than or equal to discover of current.

05:30.350 --> 05:35.530
When again with this case guys, this can be a case when a particular package.

05:36.910 --> 05:39.610
When a particular package in the subtree of.

05:40.860 --> 05:42.750
X is pointing to current.

05:43.020 --> 05:46.280
Let's see, these are back as we just pointing to current node eight.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.530
That means that disk over time is equal to the current note.

05:49.980 --> 05:56.110
But guys, then will this edge, as we are wondering about, will this be a bridge?

05:57.190 --> 06:02.320
It should not be able to generate buy because if lowest of x.

06:03.260 --> 06:05.180
Is equal to discovered of current.

06:06.530 --> 06:09.620
That means there was some package which is coming to discovery of content.

06:09.740 --> 06:10.850
That's why it's discovery.

06:10.850 --> 06:13.510
Time is being taken into consideration.

06:15.140 --> 06:18.950
If this is the case, that means this cannot be a bridge.

06:19.550 --> 06:22.460
Because if I remove this, then the subtree of x.

06:23.620 --> 06:27.160
Is still connected to current by some of the wreckage.

06:28.290 --> 06:31.140
It means the graph is not being divided into more connected.

06:32.870 --> 06:33.170
They'd.

06:34.610 --> 06:34.740
Who?

06:34.960 --> 06:35.200
This.

06:35.350 --> 06:37.390
If I'm removing this edge, then still.

06:37.420 --> 06:38.960
Still the results from current.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.030
These are still.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.880
There's the bathroom carrying two separate effects.

06:42.190 --> 06:43.780
That means it should not be upgraded.

06:44.710 --> 06:45.000
They?

06:45.930 --> 06:47.160
When will it be abridged?

06:47.370 --> 06:49.020
There's only one bathroom got into.

06:49.290 --> 06:50.280
That is only through this.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.580
It abridged eight days.

06:53.860 --> 06:55.510
So let's remove all of them.

06:56.050 --> 06:56.890
Certainly not this one.

06:59.350 --> 07:06.820
I hope you understood you understood that even when I by my not using equal to here if it is equal to

07:06.820 --> 07:08.660
that then also these are portrayed.

07:09.020 --> 07:10.900
And and of course if.

07:11.080 --> 07:15.340
Lowest of x low of x is like less than discovery of current.

07:15.340 --> 07:16.120
What does this mean?

07:16.480 --> 07:18.250
That I'm going somewhere above current?

07:18.760 --> 07:20.850
Oh, here we don't happen.

07:20.860 --> 07:21.970
We don't need a discussion.

07:21.970 --> 07:22.300
Right?

07:22.310 --> 07:25.540
Because if I remove this bridge, if I study, it's not abraded.

07:25.930 --> 07:28.720
If I remove this edge, then the whole.

07:29.750 --> 07:36.650
A eye view is connected to the whole lower subtree all a graph is connected to the lower graph and we

07:36.920 --> 07:40.580
are a bridge because low affects is less than discovered.

07:40.580 --> 07:43.610
Time of current edge is pointing somewhere above current.

07:44.670 --> 07:45.160
Right, guys.

07:46.890 --> 07:49.230
So this was the first definition of.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.090
The bridge.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.800
They took only one thing that we need.

07:53.250 --> 07:56.970
So there are only two things that we need to know for every note.

07:57.270 --> 07:59.600
First is Louis time, and the second is discovered by.

08:00.660 --> 08:00.860
Right.

08:01.200 --> 08:07.980
And Vice just saying, if Lewis time of X is greater than the discovered time of current note, then

08:07.980 --> 08:09.630
that will be our research.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.560
So it's between Exxon Current.

08:14.230 --> 08:14.380
Well.

08:14.570 --> 08:15.500
So let me like.

08:18.510 --> 08:23.340
As between a current and ex is a bridge.

08:24.400 --> 08:24.880
Edge.

08:27.090 --> 08:27.900
This holds true.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.030
So this was about Bridgegate.

08:30.570 --> 08:32.250
This was about a bridge connection.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.040
Now we have to talk about articulation point.

08:37.360 --> 08:37.610
Well.

08:38.380 --> 08:42.250
So when can I see the current audience articulation boys?

08:44.250 --> 08:46.090
Again, very, very simple thing, right?

08:46.110 --> 08:48.840
Just think about the above case, the bridge case.

08:49.230 --> 08:54.540
If I remove this node, that means this subtree should get disconnected from the above part.

08:56.510 --> 09:02.070
Because the coroner is already removed from the above, the subject should remain disconnected.

09:02.090 --> 09:09.110
That means the package, the minimum package which is pointing above, should be greater than equal

09:09.110 --> 09:09.890
to the current load.

09:10.430 --> 09:13.080
There's only one difference that blew off X.

09:13.100 --> 09:18.550
Now it should be greater than or equal to discovered of current by equal to base.

09:18.770 --> 09:20.360
Now for the articulation point.

09:21.510 --> 09:26.570
If content is to be an articulation point, then even if there is an edge which is pointing to the current,

09:26.580 --> 09:32.880
or if there is a package which is even taking me to the current node, then also current will be an

09:32.880 --> 09:39.480
articulation point because this subtree is getting disconnected because I I'll remove current and it's

09:39.690 --> 09:40.860
just in there just to read.

09:41.400 --> 09:45.480
But this package will be removed even if you're just pointing to the discovery of current.

09:45.690 --> 09:52.020
But if this package is like going somewhere above it is going somewhere above in the graph, then.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.780
This current or cannot be called articulation point.

09:56.020 --> 10:00.760
Because if I remove this current will, the above graph is connected to the lower graph.

10:01.890 --> 10:02.220
Right.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.820
So this was about articulation points in bridges.

10:06.850 --> 10:11.240
Let's have some good let's have an example and figure this out.

10:11.620 --> 10:12.640
Let's have an example.

10:13.810 --> 10:16.690
Or what we can do is we've already made many examples.

10:17.630 --> 10:22.380
Okay, so let's move let's go to those examples and start comparing these two terms.

10:22.770 --> 10:22.930
Well.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.150
So coming to this example is.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.200
Oh, let's talk about wondering, do I?

10:32.210 --> 10:35.180
So what are the terms that we need here in lieu of x?

10:35.480 --> 10:36.590
X is a child of current.

10:37.260 --> 10:40.930
If it is greater than discovered of current, then it is a bridge.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.110
So let's talk about bridges.

10:42.920 --> 10:43.070
Okay.

10:43.160 --> 10:43.580
So.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.810
Are there any bridges in this?

10:45.820 --> 10:46.690
If we can see.

10:47.170 --> 10:47.740
Yeah, this.

10:47.740 --> 10:49.090
This can be a bridge, right?

10:49.870 --> 10:51.070
So let's talk about this edge.

10:51.070 --> 10:51.610
This edge.

10:52.780 --> 10:57.820
As we can see, that low of X, which is five, it is greater than discovered of green bridges.

11:01.040 --> 11:04.070
I discovered of and discovered of Korean War.

11:04.070 --> 11:05.720
Just seven days.

11:06.660 --> 11:07.680
The five is greater than four.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.850
That means it is a bridge.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.940
Otherwise we don't have a bridge, which you can easily take.

11:14.760 --> 11:15.210
Now.

11:16.880 --> 11:17.070
This.

11:17.470 --> 11:18.820
The second is that.

11:21.540 --> 11:21.800
Yeah.

11:22.440 --> 11:26.820
This again is if lieu of x is greater than equal to discovered of current.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.070
So this will give me a relation point.

11:29.610 --> 11:32.370
So one is not in articulation going to is not an articulation point.

11:32.670 --> 11:35.760
He is not an he b is not an articulation point.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.860
8056.

11:39.070 --> 11:40.980
I know this.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.030
No food?

11:43.030 --> 11:43.360
No.

11:44.080 --> 11:47.440
These are not in our relations when a seven is in our relation point eight.

11:47.810 --> 11:54.400
So at seven we can see this, that discovery of seven which is a very seven.

11:54.400 --> 11:54.700
Yeah.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.800
Seven is their discovery of seven is for.

11:57.830 --> 11:58.120
Right.

11:58.820 --> 12:05.990
The discovery of seven is less than equal to Norfolk's what it takes by just five.

12:07.580 --> 12:09.340
So we can see forest as anywhere to fight.

12:10.870 --> 12:13.540
Norfolk's, which is eight and its lowest is five.

12:14.880 --> 12:15.290
Release.

12:16.730 --> 12:19.930
If this condition was true, that means the No.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.310
Number seven was an articulation point.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.810
Well, let's move above.

12:25.620 --> 12:25.910
Okay.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.490
So here you're going to have another doubted.

12:27.930 --> 12:29.970
Tell me whether it is another racing point or not.

12:30.270 --> 12:31.470
It is not an allegation point.

12:31.470 --> 12:32.830
Right, because I'm removing it.

12:32.850 --> 12:33.660
It's a live note.

12:34.110 --> 12:38.130
If I remove it, all it said is still the graph is going to do it in an unbroken.

12:38.130 --> 12:45.120
I don't believe it is one eight, so we will never consider it a note as an articulation point if it

12:45.120 --> 12:46.290
does not have a subtree.

12:47.330 --> 12:48.740
Because there is no X for it.

12:49.160 --> 12:49.460
No.

12:49.700 --> 12:52.070
No surgery means no child offered.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.280
It does not have a target.

12:54.290 --> 12:55.510
It cannot be an articulation point.

12:58.660 --> 13:01.590
Let's move over and let's discuss about this.

13:03.540 --> 13:05.580
I don't think much discussion is required now.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.800
I hope you must have understood why.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.070
What is this cover time?

13:09.090 --> 13:14.690
What is the lowest time and how is lowest time being used to calculate articulation, point and budget?

13:15.730 --> 13:17.740
Edges of bridges if an olive.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.540
From the subtree of x the child.

13:22.260 --> 13:25.670
I can only come back to this only.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.600
At most I cannot go above.

13:29.130 --> 13:31.770
That means there was only one pod between current and ex.

13:32.850 --> 13:35.910
If there was only one wall between Carrington, it was a bridge.

13:37.080 --> 13:42.180
And if I'm able to go to this node, that means it can be an articulation point to.

13:43.570 --> 13:50.680
Hey, because if I remove this, I also remove this because I remove this edge and the down the subtree

13:50.680 --> 13:53.170
of x will be disconnected from the above graph.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.300
It is patterned off current.

13:56.390 --> 13:56.660
Eight.

13:57.750 --> 13:58.680
But that's always.

14:00.280 --> 14:01.220
You're doing my best.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.650
But yeah, it's a little tricky topic.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.930
In the next part we'll be discussing about.

14:07.920 --> 14:12.750
What I want you to do is like make some five, five, six random small groups right there discovered

14:12.750 --> 14:15.660
in Lewiston and then try to.

14:16.490 --> 14:17.740
I mean, this condition, right?

14:18.590 --> 14:21.100
There's just one small thing that is still left over.

14:21.430 --> 14:23.290
For the root note, we have special conditions.

14:24.070 --> 14:26.110
If I want to know whether I would notice a.

14:29.140 --> 14:30.010
Of what we say.

14:30.160 --> 14:30.430
Yeah.

14:30.460 --> 14:31.300
Articulation point.

14:31.810 --> 14:36.400
If we if I want to know then whether or not is an articulation point or not, we have some specific

14:36.400 --> 14:37.180
conditions for it.

14:37.630 --> 14:37.930
Okay.

14:38.380 --> 14:42.240
So, okay, let's discuss those specific conditions in this video only.

14:42.740 --> 14:43.000
Hey.

14:44.440 --> 14:46.030
So let's talk about the do not case.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.150
And this is one way to.

14:51.260 --> 14:57.440
And this as we can see, that there is no above graph on the graph to which one is connected.

14:57.830 --> 14:58.130
Okay.

14:58.460 --> 15:03.530
But we cannot say that if I go into subtree of one and then I can go above because there is no node

15:03.530 --> 15:03.860
above.

15:04.400 --> 15:04.590
Okay.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.340
So what happens if I remove and root node?

15:09.390 --> 15:12.180
What happens if I remove an ordinance of what would not be?

15:12.360 --> 15:15.330
We have some special conditions and it's a very small condition.

15:15.330 --> 15:16.380
A very simple condition.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.060
Is that if.

15:20.340 --> 15:22.320
A number of child.

15:24.060 --> 15:24.960
Number of child.

15:25.910 --> 15:27.740
Of this route north of route north.

15:30.700 --> 15:31.690
It's greater than one.

15:33.620 --> 15:34.550
In their day FSG.

15:38.970 --> 15:39.330
Then.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.220
It is our articulation point.

15:48.970 --> 15:49.210
Well.

15:50.380 --> 15:52.360
So now we have a third thing.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.310
There is a number of child in India history.

15:54.310 --> 15:58.330
Again, it's a very simple thing is how to find out the number of child in India history.

15:58.840 --> 16:04.240
Whenever we are going to a new node which is not visited, it is a child of the current rate.

16:04.900 --> 16:06.700
So let's go to simple example.

16:06.700 --> 16:07.630
I started from one.

16:07.630 --> 16:08.500
I went to two.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.330
From two I went to.

16:12.570 --> 16:13.610
Do you know?

16:14.780 --> 16:16.110
And from three a.

16:17.090 --> 16:21.070
We're running them backwards to do anything backwards from one guy.

16:21.230 --> 16:25.910
I was just able to go to to write directly, only to visit.

16:25.910 --> 16:27.710
I love when he's not as I love one.

16:28.810 --> 16:30.160
Late in the day, FSG.

16:31.030 --> 16:31.270
Hey.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.760
But how many child does this one have?

16:33.790 --> 16:34.810
It is only one thing.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.040
That is true.

16:36.070 --> 16:37.750
So will it be an articulation point?

16:37.780 --> 16:38.170
No.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.690
But I know articulation being the number of child of the road.

16:40.690 --> 16:42.010
Nought, it should be greater than one.

16:43.180 --> 16:44.440
It should be greater than one.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.670
Why am I saying greater than one?

16:45.670 --> 16:49.630
Because, again, let's do a normal visualization, a very simple one.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.410
It's it is one and it has one, Julia.

16:53.560 --> 16:54.820
And it is some second child.

16:54.820 --> 16:55.030
You.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.700
So later there were more than one.

16:58.730 --> 17:01.720
So if I remove this, that means this whole subtree.

17:02.910 --> 17:06.000
This first subtree is disconnected from the second subtree.

17:07.100 --> 17:09.290
These two subjects are disconnected from each other.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.070
That means.

17:11.040 --> 17:16.110
When wasn't articulation point because removing it they might get off into a more connected component.

17:18.720 --> 17:24.120
But now if they were connected, if they were connected somewhere down.

17:24.420 --> 17:27.240
That means this cannot be taken.

17:27.270 --> 17:27.810
Told them.

17:28.170 --> 17:28.600
They.

17:28.620 --> 17:30.330
Because that's how the defense works.

17:30.330 --> 17:30.690
Rain.

17:31.950 --> 17:33.630
Uh, let me give you an example.

17:34.630 --> 17:34.860
It's.

17:34.900 --> 17:35.980
I had this one.

17:37.220 --> 17:37.550
You.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.100
And what?

17:40.740 --> 17:41.740
I don't know what will happen.

17:41.760 --> 17:47.760
Davis will start from one quarter to the number of J.Lo venues to right now, number of J.Lo venues.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.860
One right know because I went to I rented three.

17:50.340 --> 17:52.830
I came back to do I came back to one then I went to four.

17:52.830 --> 17:53.970
So number of channels to.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.240
I certainly do.

17:56.250 --> 17:59.220
And the Secretary's for we have to jail her.

17:59.220 --> 18:01.910
So removing one will give me an articulation point.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.170
Give me a it will be an articulation point.

18:04.830 --> 18:06.510
But what if three and four were connected?

18:06.840 --> 18:09.990
But in this graph, what if three and four were connected, guys?

18:10.530 --> 18:13.950
Then how would there be a physical feat that you would start from?

18:13.950 --> 18:17.850
One, it will go to two, it will go to three and it will go to four.

18:18.870 --> 18:20.220
Now goes Ford is visited.

18:20.220 --> 18:20.610
Right.

18:20.730 --> 18:23.310
So I cannot go too forward from one.

18:23.310 --> 18:27.390
No, I went to to arrange the trip and do for what is visited.

18:27.420 --> 18:28.160
Come back to three.

18:28.200 --> 18:32.520
Come back to to come back to one and not go to Ford because it is visited under done back.

18:33.360 --> 18:39.000
How many child of another Durga is now in the d of history we have only one child who will no one be

18:39.000 --> 18:39.570
in our division.

18:39.570 --> 18:39.900
Point?

18:40.440 --> 18:40.890
No.

18:42.110 --> 18:42.650
Always.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.540
I hope you got this point.

18:47.080 --> 18:51.320
What is the meaning of the number of change made in their DFC?

18:51.400 --> 18:52.160
In their DFC?

18:52.160 --> 18:56.390
GC everything is related to the offseason packages a.

18:58.080 --> 19:03.600
So seeing the next video going in the next part, I will be coding all of this that I have already discussed.

19:04.170 --> 19:04.530
Eight.

19:05.400 --> 19:13.230
And we will be finding our discovered Louis time in C++ of some graphs and also print bridges will also

19:13.230 --> 19:18.830
print isolation points for some random gaps with those in the next four days.

19:18.870 --> 19:19.260
Thank you.
