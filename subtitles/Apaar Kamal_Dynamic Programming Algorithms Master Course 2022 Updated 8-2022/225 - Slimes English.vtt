00:01.280 --> 00:01.880
Hello, everyone.

00:02.150 --> 00:06.500
Welcome to this problem claims and it's continuing with this.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.920
So let me quickly tell you something about this problem.

00:11.480 --> 00:20.130
You don't see lots of these problems which are quite NQ type of solution and mostly all of the problems

00:20.130 --> 00:24.620
with built theme, but their cost function will change a little later.

00:24.620 --> 00:29.420
They are very there are many standard problems of this type.

00:30.550 --> 00:30.760
Right.

00:31.030 --> 00:31.360
So.

00:32.860 --> 00:38.110
I'll tell you what other problems to practice off topic this thing this it's a good level problem,

00:38.110 --> 00:38.380
guys.

00:38.890 --> 00:42.730
And if you understand it, you can pick this many problems which are related to this.

00:44.020 --> 00:44.980
So, yeah.

00:46.780 --> 00:50.600
The problem is the admin sees that there are and claims lined up in a row.

00:51.470 --> 00:57.350
Initially the ID slime from the left has a size of a god who is trying to combine all the flames into

00:57.350 --> 00:58.010
a larger slime.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.360
You will perform the following operation repeatedly until there is only one slime.

01:03.280 --> 01:09.220
So choose to add distance length and then combine and combine them into a new same museum as a size

01:09.580 --> 01:10.390
expressway.

01:11.050 --> 01:17.080
Basically, we have many slaves and we are combining who are just in planes one by one.

01:17.440 --> 01:22.380
So in Italy, how many options we have we have and minus one options, we can combine any of them,

01:22.390 --> 01:23.110
minus one option.

01:23.110 --> 01:27.910
So if they are enslaves, that means I can combine any of the two at this entrance.

01:27.910 --> 01:30.190
So there and minus one a decent length.

01:31.600 --> 01:37.770
Here does News Limited space x plus five, x and y are the sizes of the slime before combining them.

01:38.310 --> 01:38.520
Eight.

01:38.970 --> 01:43.620
So if it was three and four you in and combine three and five, then it becomes eight eight and the

01:43.830 --> 01:45.630
cost which is incurred is X plus.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.180
Okay, this is what I was talking about.

01:48.180 --> 01:49.280
It's not always explosive.

01:49.360 --> 01:53.040
It can be in the Y or some function of X and Y, right?

01:53.970 --> 01:59.040
A lot of problems like this, and all of them have very similar solution to the position.

01:59.040 --> 02:03.150
A relationship of length does not change while combining seams.

02:03.610 --> 02:11.220
So this means that, again, if we take an example, let's say if I combine 20 and 30, then so then

02:11.220 --> 02:12.600
50, that will be the new.

02:15.090 --> 02:16.250
Size of the same rate.

02:16.260 --> 02:20.280
Experts say that during previous studies, 5850 cost isn't good.

02:20.310 --> 02:20.880
That's fine.

02:21.150 --> 02:23.250
But the new size of the same becomes 50.

02:24.090 --> 02:24.390
So.

02:25.610 --> 02:34.040
That 50 slimes made so that 50 so that size 50 will come in the middle of ten and 40, it will be ten,

02:34.040 --> 02:34.880
15, 40.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.490
You cannot change the position of the slaves.

02:38.430 --> 02:38.640
Well.

02:38.820 --> 02:40.320
So here you can see an example.

02:40.320 --> 02:45.420
The first one is to have ten and 20, which is 30, then have.

02:46.380 --> 02:46.650
Okay.

02:46.650 --> 02:47.860
So what does it cost in here?

02:48.180 --> 02:49.830
And this Randy is 38.

02:49.830 --> 02:53.760
So the new size of the same is also 30 and the cost incurred is also 30.

02:54.180 --> 02:55.230
So there is a cost.

02:56.600 --> 03:02.270
And what we have to do is find the minimum possible constraint so we can do it for minimum.

03:02.270 --> 03:03.470
We can also do it for maximum.

03:03.470 --> 03:04.820
Let's see how to do.

03:06.180 --> 03:14.710
And yeah so here we have now that it was 3030 so combining my 30 and 30 a good 60 so a little also starting

03:14.850 --> 03:15.660
to go after 60.

03:15.660 --> 03:21.780
So it becomes 90 right now and here we have 6040 which is 100, 200 plus 90.

03:21.780 --> 03:23.460
The previous course becomes 190.

03:23.460 --> 03:25.770
So this is minimum possible, total cost.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.360
Let me give you some examples.

03:28.770 --> 03:29.610
Let's have this.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.410
Ten, 20, 30, 40.

03:32.340 --> 03:37.470
There can be a way that I can start combining on the left hand side, or we can think of some approaches

03:37.470 --> 03:37.920
to that.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.450
Okay, start combining from the bigger, the smaller or smaller to big array.

03:41.460 --> 03:42.930
So let's see it.

03:43.260 --> 03:45.630
In the end, all of this will be reduced.

03:45.630 --> 03:46.080
200.

03:47.590 --> 03:47.820
Right.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.850
Because we are we have to combine them.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.730
Yes, I just I.

03:53.010 --> 03:55.170
I actually got reminded of the problem.

03:56.360 --> 03:56.990
Just a second.

03:59.710 --> 04:02.350
The problem there was it's called.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.650
Actually, we have to apply brackets within the mattresses.

04:12.560 --> 04:12.890
It's.

04:14.370 --> 04:18.020
Mattress multiplication, I guess, just as it can.

04:20.250 --> 04:20.520
Yep.

04:20.520 --> 04:23.290
So it is called metrics multiplication.

04:23.290 --> 04:23.540
Right.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.180
So it's very similar problem to metrics in multiplication.

04:27.500 --> 04:31.470
Well, so after this, after doing this, after understanding this and solving this.

04:31.470 --> 04:31.710
Yes.

04:31.710 --> 04:33.600
Move on and do the.

04:34.510 --> 04:38.650
Problem, which is metrics, gene multiplication yourself.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.990
So let's continue with the claims that I know we have and minus one options.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.970
We can combine any of these two claims.

04:49.970 --> 04:55.880
And also after having and minus one steps after having in minus one.

04:58.350 --> 04:59.730
Operations being performed.

04:59.890 --> 05:00.160
Eight.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.500
What will happen in the end?

05:01.680 --> 05:05.360
All of this will be converted to hundred no matter how I perform it again.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.540
Let's take a small example.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.120
It's going to enter into entity.

05:09.690 --> 05:12.600
But what are the options I have as that I can do 10/21?

05:13.660 --> 05:15.460
And then how do you do it?

05:15.750 --> 05:19.060
Or what I can do is basically this becomes 30.

05:19.870 --> 05:24.040
3038 and the total cost incurred is 30 now.

05:24.310 --> 05:28.610
In this in the right side, what we can do is I can either combine 20 or 30 with just 50, so it becomes

05:28.630 --> 05:31.870
ten and 15 at Costco -50.

05:32.170 --> 05:36.640
Now, after this, I have only one option, which is 30 plus 30, which is 60, and the cost incurred

05:36.640 --> 05:37.180
is 60.

05:37.540 --> 05:41.500
And here I have only one option, which is the cost incurred, which is 60.

05:42.560 --> 05:49.980
Full sail, we have 60 plus 50, which is 110, but here we have 60 plus 30, which is 90, only 85

05:50.000 --> 05:51.110
to find a minimum course.

05:51.110 --> 05:57.640
So here you can see guys that if I'm combining 30 with 21st, that means I'm actually adding 32 months

05:57.740 --> 05:59.930
and 20 to my final answer.

06:00.470 --> 06:02.540
Both of them are being added to the final answer.

06:02.540 --> 06:07.760
If they're being added to the final answer and let them again combining you'd written the 30 has been

06:07.760 --> 06:14.090
added to my final answer twice now because honestly, I combine it with 29, it has become 50 because

06:14.090 --> 06:17.600
50 contains 30 another 30 is again being a minority and.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.300
It is being combined ten but it has 13 it rate.

06:21.420 --> 06:23.670
So it is being combined two times that.

06:23.670 --> 06:27.990
So we are getting bigger on so because he had he's been coming to terms but in this case for us we are

06:27.990 --> 06:30.420
combining ten and 20 and then we are combining.

06:31.960 --> 06:32.800
20 and 38.

06:33.900 --> 06:34.350
So.

06:36.820 --> 06:37.020
Yeah.

06:37.620 --> 06:37.850
Yeah.

06:37.870 --> 06:43.060
So this was an example, guys, that how can we move forward with the example approach?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.500
How can they make different cases?

06:45.400 --> 06:51.010
So what I would suggest is I would always suggest you would think of this problem in a opposite order,

06:51.010 --> 06:52.510
in just, just opposite order.

06:53.350 --> 06:59.740
Initially, what we have is we have instead of combining ten and 21st order and being 31st or 30 and

06:59.740 --> 07:02.140
41st eight, what happens is.

07:03.450 --> 07:07.740
We do this problem in just complete opposite order that in the end it will become under.

07:08.830 --> 07:10.390
800.

07:10.390 --> 07:13.720
How can the 800 come from 800 Canada come from?

07:15.170 --> 07:16.820
I'm talking about the total size.

07:18.010 --> 07:19.420
The 100 can come from.

07:19.930 --> 07:22.870
If this was you guys in the end.

07:23.540 --> 07:26.740
Okay, let me go a little slow here.

07:28.020 --> 07:33.750
What I mean to say is that in the end then there will be only two bytes left which will finally combine

07:33.750 --> 07:36.450
into what I hope got this rate.

07:36.450 --> 07:41.040
In the end, they only two points left, no matter how much now along is that we are combining them,

07:41.190 --> 07:44.220
so we're combining optimally and then there are only two points left.

07:44.700 --> 07:48.120
But those two piles can be either this.

07:49.080 --> 07:49.650
Or this.

07:49.650 --> 07:51.510
That means ten Goma.

07:52.170 --> 07:52.650
90.

07:53.990 --> 07:55.550
Or that bile can be.

07:56.980 --> 07:59.620
This or this, that is.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.570
30, Goma, 70.

08:04.660 --> 08:08.440
Or the pile can be 60, comma 40.

08:10.610 --> 08:11.880
That is hundred.

08:12.730 --> 08:18.370
Like is the only we only have these three options from which I can actually make it.

08:18.370 --> 08:23.200
In the end, it is the last operation that will be performed.

08:23.260 --> 08:24.190
There will be the.

08:25.310 --> 08:26.000
Where do we call it?

08:28.040 --> 08:28.340
Yeah.

08:28.550 --> 08:34.880
The last combination, the last operation that will be performed will only be from these three particular

08:34.880 --> 08:35.440
positions.

08:36.080 --> 08:36.360
Hey.

08:37.540 --> 08:44.470
So what will happen is the cost the cost of combining these two is equal to the cost of combining these

08:44.470 --> 08:47.670
two is equal to the cost of combining these eight.

08:47.920 --> 08:53.980
The cost of combining all of them is equal to one because both of these are equal to eight.

08:54.730 --> 08:56.290
So here the cost is same.

08:56.470 --> 09:02.710
But what we have to find is we have to find the best possible answer that, okay, if I do this, that

09:02.710 --> 09:03.550
is 1370.

09:03.550 --> 09:09.640
That is if I combine tender and be first and combine 30/41, then it will give me 30 and this will give

09:09.640 --> 09:10.330
me 78.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.880
So is this giving me the best answer or is this giving me the best answer?

09:13.880 --> 09:15.250
Or it is just giving me the best answer.

09:16.090 --> 09:19.960
So right now I'm just talking about the last operation that needs to be performed.

09:20.350 --> 09:26.470
That means when I have only two particular states, so it's the way I solved any programming problems.

09:26.740 --> 09:29.860
I take the base case first and there's only one left.

09:30.310 --> 09:31.060
Then I take two.

09:31.780 --> 09:32.800
Now there are only two left.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.390
How will I like?

09:34.390 --> 09:35.470
How will depend on one?

09:35.470 --> 09:37.690
Then I take three, then I have three left.

09:37.690 --> 09:39.070
How will it depend on two?

09:39.790 --> 09:43.630
And when I get this did holders three how does it depend on two?

09:44.170 --> 09:47.050
Then I the solution.

09:48.010 --> 09:50.920
May I start from the bases and we can understand that.

09:51.940 --> 09:53.980
Now is this dent in 98.

09:54.160 --> 09:59.110
So we're just in An and B means that there was some solution that was formed by combining 20, 30,

09:59.110 --> 10:01.780
40, and there was some solution that was formed by combining this ten.

10:02.700 --> 10:07.050
Well, that's why we are voting in 90 and there is some answer associated with it, whatever is optimal

10:07.050 --> 10:07.350
answer.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.940
But how is this being formed?

10:09.820 --> 10:11.020
It then will be as it is.

10:11.230 --> 10:13.120
And it will be.

10:14.960 --> 10:19.000
So now what we have is now we have 2013 and 40 have to be in the same group.

10:19.070 --> 10:28.410
So here we have two options and there it was 24, ten was already there, then it was drawn down 70.

10:29.180 --> 10:35.990
That means 27 people combined or then was already there and let's say 50 Goma 40 was coming.

10:37.610 --> 10:38.090
And this.

10:39.560 --> 10:44.390
How is this day in and day being formed and was already then I think I wonder then but we have to break

10:44.390 --> 10:51.320
the 1992 for about how is 90 been combined and then it is combined with 27 audit is combined with 50

10:51.320 --> 10:52.630
plus 48.

10:52.700 --> 10:56.360
So what what is happening here is we are trying to make all possible.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.740
We tried to make all possible passenger donors.

11:00.740 --> 11:06.550
The minimum answer was let's let's make all possible bots so that we can do standard.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.130
Deeply.

11:08.890 --> 11:15.300
So yeah, we have been and this line began to be formed but with other 50, comma 40.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.660
Or in Goma?

11:19.630 --> 11:20.190
50.

11:20.190 --> 11:21.450
Goma, not 50?

11:21.450 --> 11:21.690
No.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.350
It will be.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.090
Randy Coma.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.440
78.

11:28.340 --> 11:28.960
So what's happening?

11:28.970 --> 11:31.160
I'm combining 50 going 40 already.

11:31.160 --> 11:35.000
Almost everybody here right now is isn't the problem that how did this become?

11:35.000 --> 11:41.210
This 50 will only come from one step only there it is ten and I'm combining 20 and 30 and then 40.

11:41.930 --> 11:47.030
I we are getting this they're actually instead of starting from here by combining one, one and going

11:47.030 --> 11:49.060
back, I'm doing it the opposite way.

11:49.070 --> 11:52.160
Just to make you understand, how does this work right now?

11:52.160 --> 11:56.990
This can be only by ten, 20, 30 and 40 is being combined.

11:57.860 --> 11:59.030
So here the is what's done.

11:59.030 --> 12:03.440
So that's been coming 70 because 1340 has been combined if this coming from you.

12:04.860 --> 12:06.930
Let's take another call for answers.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.600
Here we are getting 50.

12:13.410 --> 12:15.780
We are getting 70 now.

12:16.490 --> 12:17.910
No, not this.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.430
This has a total answer of 50 with a grade.

12:20.970 --> 12:23.530
So 50 plus whatever is combining.

12:23.550 --> 12:25.800
So it is 90 plus 50, which is equal to.

12:28.770 --> 12:29.580
148.

12:29.790 --> 12:36.890
So this is giving me 140 and this is giving me 70 plus 90, which is 168.

12:36.930 --> 12:37.620
So which is better?

12:38.100 --> 12:39.330
Of course, 140 is better.

12:39.330 --> 12:39.630
So.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.210
So this one that can go my 90.

12:42.450 --> 12:45.570
This particular subset is being formed by only using 140.

12:45.870 --> 12:47.130
This is our main minimum.

12:47.130 --> 12:48.600
So it wasn't trying.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.050
I'm going all possible parts and I'm having the minimum.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.740
But similarly for this.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.110
Similarly for this, the same thing will happen.

12:57.340 --> 13:01.270
And for this also the same subtree like this will be form eight.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.370
So here what we are doing is we are trying to combine all possible parts.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.680
Let me take brute force and then you will easily understand.

13:08.060 --> 13:09.860
How does that work in that case?

13:10.190 --> 13:10.460
Hey.

13:11.670 --> 13:12.060
So.

13:12.060 --> 13:12.360
Yeah.
