00:01.150 --> 00:04.060
So another palindromic problem almost.

00:04.060 --> 00:06.970
I've covered many types of problems in this section.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.500
String matching problems and.

00:10.730 --> 00:17.660
Doing pattern matching also in the subsequent listings problems also so do when a string is find the

00:17.660 --> 00:20.570
longest palindromic sequence lengthen is.

00:21.580 --> 00:22.120
This is good.

00:22.270 --> 00:25.990
So here we are asked to find the longest, but in dooming subsequent, not the substring.

00:27.220 --> 00:33.640
In this case it's for it is IB and because b b b the subsequent we all know the difference.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.030
It is CBD and this it is only two.

00:37.030 --> 00:38.320
It can be double b.

00:40.980 --> 00:42.810
Another easy problem is that we have.

00:43.930 --> 00:45.790
Now you must have realized this.

00:45.790 --> 00:46.540
Only you know this.

00:47.380 --> 00:57.010
If I say that DPA comedy is the answer, our longest palindromic subsequent for us upsetting s I do

00:57.760 --> 00:59.080
it eight.

00:59.560 --> 01:04.540
So my final answer will be deep euro comma and -4 million is the length of this.

01:05.380 --> 01:13.440
Tell me if I say zero zero woman medicine, what all options do zero character and minus one character

01:13.440 --> 01:13.800
have?

01:15.750 --> 01:18.720
You know, character in my husband's character have what all options are.

01:20.130 --> 01:21.420
So the first case is simple.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.540
If both of them are equal, let me generalize.

01:24.540 --> 01:26.190
It would be ideal.

01:28.110 --> 01:28.770
IMDB.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.720
I got my g.

01:29.730 --> 01:32.340
So Casement if shc goes to LG.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.350
And it's very simple.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.830
It is to bless DP.

01:37.280 --> 01:43.970
Big them as a palindromic subsequently include both of them in a subsequent and move it forward.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.100
That means now we have the middle string left.

01:46.100 --> 01:46.430
Eight.

01:47.300 --> 01:52.340
I know the longest palindromic subsequent indexing and that because we are digging both of them because

01:52.340 --> 01:55.220
they are eight, eight plus seven.

01:55.220 --> 01:56.960
Comedy minus one in both.

01:58.330 --> 02:06.900
I 2G and boundaries made that equal examine if we are digging both of them in, I like to nurse whatever

02:06.910 --> 02:07.570
is in the middle.

02:08.350 --> 02:09.490
In the middle something.

02:09.490 --> 02:12.250
Give me the best, longest, but and only subsequent in the middle.

02:12.550 --> 02:14.410
But we know that rate that if.

02:16.530 --> 02:17.280
What about in Rome?

02:17.280 --> 02:19.320
If A.D. Golden Middle has to be a bit.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.150
And what is the second case is one, but it's the second case.

02:24.150 --> 02:25.080
If they're not equal.

02:25.500 --> 02:29.690
If they're not equal, release what what other options there are other.

02:29.700 --> 02:32.760
I cannot come in the subsequent take and come late.

02:32.760 --> 02:33.300
That means.

02:35.050 --> 02:39.460
Give me whatever is the maximum sequence of A-plus on comedy.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.010
That means being loaded and exclude.

02:42.010 --> 02:42.460
A-plus.

02:43.150 --> 02:43.590
Exclude.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.830
I include you.

02:45.220 --> 02:49.030
What is this thing that slipped is eidetic and.

02:49.890 --> 02:50.520
They're counting.

02:51.410 --> 02:59.840
AP I comma j minus for that means not exclude the agony and give me more the best possible subsequent

02:59.840 --> 03:00.590
in this string.

03:01.040 --> 03:01.280
Eight.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.350
So the first option was include.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.270
But the second option is.

03:06.570 --> 03:12.570
You either exclude one from decision or decision and find the best possible answer within the maximum.

03:13.510 --> 03:14.350
I hope this is clear.

03:14.860 --> 03:18.280
So if they will come in the longest possible subsequent, they'll come together.

03:18.700 --> 03:19.330
It's the case.

03:19.330 --> 03:20.270
One hour.

03:20.380 --> 03:23.350
They will not comment at the end.

03:24.310 --> 03:25.450
Page eight.

03:25.970 --> 03:26.950
What's the base case here?

03:27.190 --> 03:28.910
There can be two types of base cases.

03:28.930 --> 03:31.210
We all know if I base cases.

03:31.630 --> 03:38.230
If I is equal to G, that means we are reducing or reducing I is equal to eight.

03:38.570 --> 03:43.390
So if I easily go through G, that means it is assumption of length one and it is a palindrome.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.290
And what is its length?

03:44.710 --> 03:53.410
I simply don't want it, but if I is equal to j minus one, it means now I easier and do minus one consecutive

03:53.770 --> 03:54.190
and.

03:57.390 --> 04:02.710
So if I easy quiz Friday minus one and I say is equal to equal to essay.

04:02.730 --> 04:03.540
This is important.

04:04.710 --> 04:09.090
If there equal then only written oop.

04:11.290 --> 04:11.590
Eight.

04:12.470 --> 04:15.170
Because icicles 15 minutes when they're equal.

04:15.800 --> 04:21.080
We really didn't do because that is giving me a palindromic sequence of land to aid the race.

04:22.430 --> 04:26.370
If they are not equal, then we will simply apply this thing.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.630
To Mangrove developers.

04:28.630 --> 04:32.260
One day I made this one which will let everyone in in the end.

04:32.260 --> 04:32.530
And.

04:34.490 --> 04:39.650
These are the basic cases that we need to handle separately, and I don't think much explanation is

04:39.650 --> 04:40.340
required in this.

04:41.130 --> 04:47.240
So after this, what I'll do is I'll give you some very nice string matching problems in deep problems

04:47.240 --> 04:51.830
which are what begin challenging in nature.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.400
Please spend all your time in those problems.

04:56.570 --> 04:57.290
Try to solve them.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.900
If you do want to hold this.

05:01.900 --> 05:07.640
I don't want to go with it because I've already heard so much of detail in basic issues as well.

05:08.490 --> 05:10.700
And I've ordered a lot of better problems.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.500
And I just leave it to you.

05:12.800 --> 05:13.060
It.

05:14.140 --> 05:14.950
Oh, thank you for.
