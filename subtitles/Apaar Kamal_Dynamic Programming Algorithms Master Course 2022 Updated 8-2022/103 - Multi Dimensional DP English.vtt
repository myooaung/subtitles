Hello, everyone.

1
00:01.660 --> 00:05.710
So let me quickly state what is K-dimensional dp

2
00:06.660 --> 00:11.610
The common sense now that what is k dimension, which is which has k independent variables.

3
00:12.040 --> 00:20.700
So if I have a state, let's say f(x,y,z) this becomes the 3D dp because here I say

4
00:20.700 --> 00:25.710
that X, Y and Z are independent of each other and then I'll have to memoize them.

5
00:25.710 --> 00:27.720
I have to memoize all three of them together.

6
00:28.080 --> 00:28.370
Right.

7
00:29.470 --> 00:35.990
That means I cannot derive X from Y or Z or something.

8
00:36.010 --> 00:38.530
I cannot make relations between Y and Z.

9
00:38.740 --> 00:39.350
Let's say.

10
00:39.370 --> 00:41.830
I cannot say that X is a function of.

11
00:42.980 --> 00:44.900
Y,z, right.

12
00:45.440 --> 00:50.540
This should not be that the only we can say that all of these three are independent variables.

13
00:50.540 --> 00:52.700
And so what is K dimensionally?

14
00:52.730 --> 00:57.140
k-dimensional is nothing but a state which has K independent dimension.

15
00:58.100 --> 01:00.410
That can be a 3D, it can be 4D.

16
01:00.410 --> 01:02.420
It can be five D and so on it.

17
01:02.750 --> 01:09.170
In this section I have not especially included some problems for K Dimensional DP, but after this section

18
01:09.170 --> 01:11.900
there are so many sections like DP with bit mask.

19
01:12.410 --> 01:19.970
SS DP, digit DP, initially we realize that we have to take some, we have take many dimension

20
01:20.150 --> 01:21.470
which are different right.

21
01:21.470 --> 01:26.840
So we have to use a we have to take many dimensions and find out the recursive relation and memories.

22
01:26.850 --> 01:34.160
Then you'll get an idea of K dimension DP by moving on to the further sections and yeah, that's

23
01:34.160 --> 01:34.320
it.

24
01:35.300 --> 01:41.870
In the next part, everyone, I hope you have a frankly and clearly understood how does 1D DP, 2D

25
01:41.870 --> 01:42.410
DP works.

26
01:42.410 --> 01:48.270
I've given enough examples and also I've shared some good problems in the site.

27
01:49.810 --> 01:54.990
See you in the next part for I will be beginning with something very interesting.

28
01:56.300 --> 01:57.050
cool thanks.
