WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:00.510
Okay.

00:00.610 --> 00:06.120
So let's score this problem and input is very simple is to be five so.

00:07.720 --> 00:08.740
After going to be five.

00:08.740 --> 00:12.370
I've taken the graft every year in put it already.

00:12.700 --> 00:19.220
Now firstly before moving forward, what we'll do is we'll simply calculate d d x values by making one

00:19.220 --> 00:19.670
as a rule.

00:19.670 --> 00:23.800
Let's just go read the values because we calculate the F values.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.900
I want the D values also, right?

00:26.890 --> 00:31.390
And also to calculate distance between values you can see red which is near distance.

00:31.660 --> 00:33.820
Parent We also want the g values.

00:34.120 --> 00:39.490
Firstly, let's write a small DFS which will just calculate the values for all the notes.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.210
Let me call it DFS G pull.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.760
Which are and we all know it's very easy.

00:47.940 --> 00:49.590
Or two eggs in.

00:51.920 --> 00:56.550
So I just want you to forgive me for me speaking x.

00:56.570 --> 00:59.060
Again and again x is nothing but the title.

00:59.060 --> 00:59.630
Not always.

00:59.900 --> 01:01.940
So just don't get confused ever.

01:02.940 --> 01:03.540
It just.

01:03.720 --> 01:04.530
It's just my habit.

01:04.530 --> 01:08.940
I always say eggs instead of cherry because I pick X in the code.

01:10.020 --> 01:15.660
So let's perform the DFS, DFS, G eight and X becomes the new.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.460
North Korean becomes the new parent.

01:19.060 --> 01:21.750
And let's take the records here.

01:22.150 --> 01:28.300
And what is, dear reader, is nothing but your current is nothing but max of the current.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.430
Bauman's legs.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.030
Plus one.

01:36.420 --> 01:36.670
Eight.

01:36.870 --> 01:40.800
So this is nothing Embiid max of the current plus G explosion.

01:41.160 --> 01:41.340
Eight.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.910
So this is very easy for the subtree over just getting the maximum value.

01:45.790 --> 01:47.170
Where do we want to reach?

01:47.190 --> 01:47.430
Eight.

01:47.970 --> 01:49.290
So let's call this the office.

01:50.560 --> 01:55.710
The offensive one Goma minus one initially on literary dissection, the office of which is the office

01:56.050 --> 01:59.530
in which will be calculating the values, the final values that we want.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.980
And initially, we start from the root.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.890
Not only initially the period will be minus one, and the distance between value will be minus one.

02:09.220 --> 02:13.030
So we all know that I have three things that are being parsed in this.

02:13.630 --> 02:16.780
Let me just write the A physics node.

02:17.800 --> 02:23.230
The parent node and the parent distance, not whether distance feeding.

02:23.440 --> 02:24.190
Distance feeding.

02:24.670 --> 02:25.570
Let me quickly.

02:26.970 --> 02:27.060
It.

02:27.120 --> 02:27.510
Is it?

02:28.720 --> 02:36.400
It's a distance parent made initially for the road not I'm just passing it it's minus one because it

02:36.400 --> 02:37.960
does not have a parent it.

02:38.870 --> 02:41.360
Now let's move step by step.

02:42.050 --> 02:45.320
The first step is very simple, which is this?

02:46.220 --> 02:50.990
What f of Korean we can have this g of x plus one is the maximum values.

02:51.290 --> 02:55.400
So let me quickly write that before auto x in.

02:56.370 --> 02:58.050
Occurring because it took the office.

02:58.050 --> 02:59.720
So I have to perform the DFS.

02:59.730 --> 03:04.620
If X is not equal to patent and what we can do is if X is not equal to better and just performed to

03:05.200 --> 03:09.330
the office, if it's if parent X becomes the new parent.

03:09.780 --> 03:14.180
And the third value that we need to pass is the distant new distance between value added.

03:14.190 --> 03:16.350
Because now this current node will become the parent.

03:16.920 --> 03:17.190
So.

03:18.350 --> 03:20.960
Let's initialize it, but I feel it later.

03:21.410 --> 03:29.990
New distance parent value that is actually needed to be passed over to less one because this will tell

03:29.990 --> 03:32.080
me what's the distance parent for the new node.

03:33.330 --> 03:34.980
So I'll fill this later.

03:38.680 --> 03:39.070
Later.

03:39.670 --> 03:42.790
But right now, I'm just trying to make this one work.

03:44.410 --> 03:45.640
So what is the X?

03:46.180 --> 03:51.520
What is this f off current two f of current is nothing but maximum of whatever was there.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.000
Former.

03:54.030 --> 03:54.780
Dix.

03:55.620 --> 03:56.150
Plus the.

03:57.330 --> 04:02.470
It's whatever the value in the jigsaw that is being kept less, it will be the.

04:04.580 --> 04:09.650
So for any nerd in the country.

04:10.350 --> 04:10.770
And.

04:12.420 --> 04:19.530
Or any note in the let's call it superdry naughty superdry that I'm calling Superdry is nothing but

04:19.530 --> 04:20.670
a complement of.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.560
Complement of subtree.

04:25.730 --> 04:31.220
Well, that means the laboratory for that will just do the calculation and we'll see what happens before

04:31.220 --> 04:31.460
that.

04:31.730 --> 04:32.990
The calculation is very simple.

04:32.990 --> 04:35.480
It is nothing but whatever is coming from the parent.

04:36.170 --> 04:41.570
So what is the between instance where it is telling me that from the parent in the above superdry what

04:41.570 --> 04:43.130
is the maximum length?

04:45.570 --> 04:51.120
So that I can I can, you know, just update f current over here for that afternoon.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.630
It is nothing but max off current gamma.

04:54.490 --> 04:54.860
Um.

04:54.950 --> 04:58.120
What is the distance parent +18.

04:58.130 --> 05:00.530
So what is the distance from end it is coming from.

05:00.890 --> 05:07.250
Well now the now the important part is just to formulate this new distance between regulate and this

05:07.250 --> 05:09.530
is the most interesting part of this equation.

05:09.530 --> 05:16.280
Right, that when the current node becomes the parent node, what is the new distance between that should

05:16.280 --> 05:16.550
pass.

05:16.550 --> 05:16.780
Right.

05:17.090 --> 05:21.900
But all the so when I want the current node and when it is going to become the parent, not later,

05:21.900 --> 05:26.200
I want the current or I want to bring in it's one of the child, right?

05:26.210 --> 05:29.240
So of all the other child of the good ignored actually becomes the.

05:30.250 --> 05:33.790
Nobody predict when all the other data will become the super.

05:33.970 --> 05:35.380
As I already discussing this.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.150
It's a hotchpotch.

05:37.150 --> 05:38.290
No, although.

05:38.440 --> 05:38.800
But.

05:40.390 --> 05:43.140
It's still it's still, you know as.

05:43.840 --> 05:49.180
When I moved onwards all these abbeys that all abbey invite will actually become the.

05:50.900 --> 05:51.680
Hubert relate.

05:51.800 --> 05:54.170
Or at least they were nothing but this.

05:54.480 --> 05:59.360
So what I have to do is I have to take the maximum of the all the other channels.

05:59.640 --> 06:03.410
But if I am performing, if it's only, I will take maximum value of.

06:04.510 --> 06:07.990
I like max of GB for my current.

06:08.470 --> 06:14.170
In this case it's got an eight and Devi and I loop plus one when I'm going to generate.

06:14.680 --> 06:17.530
So basically when I run, I'm going to a particular China.

06:17.530 --> 06:21.390
I want the maximum value of other countries, not the current rate.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.120
The how can I find the maximum value of others or reason or the current one?

06:25.510 --> 06:26.350
It is very simple.

06:27.540 --> 06:28.400
I can, um.

06:29.070 --> 06:33.030
What I can do is I can try to follow their lead again.

06:33.030 --> 06:35.880
Like or auto buy in graph of current.

06:36.510 --> 06:39.330
I can simply say why is an article to parent?

06:40.540 --> 06:43.930
And by is not equal to x.

06:45.240 --> 06:49.020
So in this case, we will see then what are the other nodes in this address?

06:49.020 --> 06:57.270
And we'll just take the maximum value of their maximum value of their device now and we can make that

06:57.270 --> 06:58.650
new distance variant and.

07:00.490 --> 07:02.860
Updated I new distance reading guys.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.350
It will be equal to distance between plus one.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.610
We have seen this rate.

07:06.820 --> 07:12.610
So let me in this laser with distance variant plus one initializing it with eight.

07:13.570 --> 07:15.760
I've just initialized equidistant between one plus one.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.510
And now the second bar that we need to handle is this maximum of GJ plus one.

07:19.950 --> 07:22.990
So this is where the maximum of GJ position is happening.

07:23.000 --> 07:23.740
So let me just.

07:26.340 --> 07:32.460
New distance parent is maximum of each child and.

07:33.990 --> 07:34.280
Yeah.

07:34.380 --> 07:37.140
So let's just do this plus one parent later.

07:37.470 --> 07:41.490
I'll do the plus one later because I'm already passing it as plus one.

07:41.600 --> 07:41.860
Right.

07:42.420 --> 07:42.750
So.

07:43.940 --> 07:44.230
Yeah.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.680
This plus one will be handily been embossing it with plus ones.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.180
So this becomes near distance fitting.

07:52.670 --> 07:56.090
So now this is a working solution and.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.140
43.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.350
The complexities high, Wheelock reminded Father.

08:02.590 --> 08:04.780
But I just want you to understand what's happening.

08:05.640 --> 08:06.850
So optimization is very easy.

08:06.850 --> 08:11.860
We've already discussed that optimization because I just want to do maximum value so I can just keep

08:11.950 --> 08:14.110
it to maximum value straight because.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.130
You all know that.

08:17.110 --> 08:24.590
So yeah, the for the complimentary what we have to do is we have to do nothing but which is our so

08:24.690 --> 08:26.590
I've got in common distance between plus one rate.

08:26.930 --> 08:30.490
This comes down this part is being handed over here.

08:32.470 --> 08:32.700
Cool.

08:33.210 --> 08:35.320
But so there are two things happening in this.

08:35.320 --> 08:39.940
First, is this decorating made for whatever is of value in the subtree.

08:39.940 --> 08:40.750
Just find it out.

08:40.750 --> 08:44.870
And the second is this distance between think and to make the distance parent.

08:44.890 --> 08:52.240
I'm using the distance when I'm getting and making the new distance between and passing it over here.

08:52.510 --> 08:52.680
Right.

08:52.870 --> 08:54.040
So let me build it once.

08:55.050 --> 08:56.760
Let's see if there are any errors.

08:59.660 --> 08:59.990
Yeah.

09:00.410 --> 09:01.670
So I think I might.

09:02.060 --> 09:02.480
Okay.

09:02.540 --> 09:02.930
So.

09:03.870 --> 09:06.810
I don't think anybody guesses regarding this because they debris trees.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.690
But let me quickly take it to current parent.

09:09.690 --> 09:12.060
I'm going to get off of this and I'm just doing it.

09:12.630 --> 09:18.510
And in this case, we are moving over to the other values.

09:18.840 --> 09:19.260
Okay.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.880
The offensive look.

09:22.180 --> 09:23.660
Sorry, this is this is wrong, mate.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.840
So this is aggravating and current over here.

09:26.620 --> 09:26.810
It.

09:28.110 --> 09:33.000
Well, so let me just printed the values for now, and let's see if we're getting correct answers or

09:33.000 --> 09:33.330
not.

09:34.420 --> 09:36.370
Hopefully we'll get the correct answers.

09:37.290 --> 09:38.460
I'm.

09:40.610 --> 09:40.930
Yeah.

09:40.970 --> 09:42.590
So what are the values that I'm getting?

09:42.590 --> 09:44.450
I'm getting two, three, two, three, three.

09:44.900 --> 09:45.250
Correct.

09:45.650 --> 09:47.270
So we are getting two, three, two, two, three, three.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.440
That is what we should get.

09:48.830 --> 09:50.870
We just a slight mistake that we had over here.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.060
And these are the correct values that I'm getting.

09:53.060 --> 09:53.300
Right.

09:54.270 --> 09:54.840
But no.

09:55.690 --> 09:57.270
Okay, this let me raise this later.

09:57.270 --> 09:59.730
But for now, what is the complexity of this solution?

09:59.960 --> 10:01.320
So we are performing one day of this.

10:01.650 --> 10:03.030
This is all in complexity.

10:03.030 --> 10:05.030
The first one often.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.570
What is the most complex area of the security office.

10:08.600 --> 10:15.290
So it is not overlaid because whenever I'm performing a delivers into one of the notes, I have to go

10:15.290 --> 10:16.730
over all the other.

10:17.780 --> 10:22.160
Siblings did not date, but in this case it can be and squarely in the worst case.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.470
Eight For example, it said there's only one.

10:25.490 --> 10:29.120
Nord and all the other nodes, all the other and minus one notes are connected to it.

10:29.540 --> 10:33.080
When I perform DFS in this, I have to get cleared max of all these values.

10:33.440 --> 10:38.840
When I'm performing DFS in this, I have to get a grade max of this and this, and I will do it again

10:38.840 --> 10:39.180
and again.

10:39.710 --> 10:47.060
But we all know that if I'm moving towards one direction, that means if I take maximum two values,

10:47.930 --> 10:53.690
that is max one for my max, two, if I just take max two values, then it becomes easy for me at eight.

10:54.260 --> 10:56.750
If max, one will be equal to wherever I'm going.

10:56.750 --> 11:00.510
That means that part already had the max value.

11:00.530 --> 11:03.340
That means that the x was the maximum.

11:03.350 --> 11:09.050
Then I'll pass max two because the max two will be the maximum of other values and for all the other

11:09.050 --> 11:09.470
parts.

11:10.660 --> 11:12.280
Max, one will be the maximum value.

11:12.820 --> 11:13.000
Okay.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.300
So what I mean is I can optimize this loop.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.100
Let's optimize this.

11:18.490 --> 11:21.280
It'll just come out if you want to understand distribution.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.500
But before that, let's just optimize this.

11:23.890 --> 11:27.080
But what we'll do is for any node will just keep for all its children.

11:27.850 --> 11:28.110
What?

11:28.120 --> 11:31.110
We will keep this max to values of eight.

11:31.930 --> 11:33.190
The mixture, values, objects.

11:33.190 --> 11:34.450
And we'll pass it right.

11:34.470 --> 11:38.920
So let's say max one and insulating everything with minus ones.

11:39.790 --> 11:40.090
Okay.

11:40.420 --> 11:45.400
And now let's move for all its children, let's say.

11:47.880 --> 11:48.590
I hope you understand.

11:48.690 --> 11:50.300
Why am I giving mixed reviews?

11:50.310 --> 11:53.900
Because this is important to keep the next two reviews.

11:53.910 --> 11:56.970
And because what will happen?

11:58.160 --> 12:02.950
When we have these max two values, I don't have to calculate the maximum of the other notes again and

12:02.960 --> 12:03.180
again.

12:04.490 --> 12:04.760
Yeah.

12:04.770 --> 12:09.740
So if X is not equal to parent and I want to keep the max to illustrate.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.800
So what were the cases that we discussed already?

12:12.950 --> 12:24.650
That if your fix is greater than max one, then max two becomes max one and max one becomes.

12:25.610 --> 12:26.260
Geophysics.

12:26.690 --> 12:27.060
Correct.

12:27.650 --> 12:29.120
And this was elusive.

12:30.600 --> 12:36.330
We've all discussed this in the previous problem, which is greater than max to then.

12:37.410 --> 12:43.260
Max two becomes in this way, this max one and max two.

12:43.320 --> 12:51.000
These variables going maximum in max two, we will have the two maximum values of DCS for all the daily

12:51.000 --> 12:52.800
nodes of our current eight.

12:53.070 --> 12:58.050
And by using that, what I can do is I can just formulate my new distance feeding values rate.

12:58.400 --> 13:03.510
What else is if the current node on which I'm going that means it's d x was equals to max one.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.780
That means this was giving the maximum value.

13:06.990 --> 13:07.890
Then I not introduce it.

13:08.430 --> 13:10.270
So what is the new distance between?

13:10.270 --> 13:11.190
It is nothing but.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.020
Maxim.

13:14.020 --> 13:15.250
Okay, let me give.

13:17.350 --> 13:22.690
It is maximum off because we are voting maximum because we are also including this.

13:23.410 --> 13:31.900
So yeah, so maximum of new distance period whatever was already there and max to correct.

13:32.470 --> 13:33.540
Else if.

13:34.050 --> 13:41.750
What is the excuse here ask is this simple same case that means now all know basically in which what

13:41.750 --> 13:43.240
I am going or trying to go.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.740
That is not the maximum value.

13:45.310 --> 13:51.580
So in this case, I just I just take maximum to be the maximum for the new distance variant because

13:51.580 --> 13:54.970
we are to find the maximum for all the other nodes except for the current.

13:55.750 --> 14:02.410
And by by using this maximum extra logic to here the complexity of this loop is.

14:03.730 --> 14:06.670
It is not nested, right?

14:06.970 --> 14:07.300
It is.

14:07.450 --> 14:10.120
It is actually parallel and not you know.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.010
But it is in city and not in Berlin.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.080
Basically, it is not nested inside.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.790
So the complexity won't go in square.

14:16.570 --> 14:19.240
This is nothing but just one iteration of what they are doing.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.050
Silly stuff current.

14:20.380 --> 14:26.080
And this is again one iteration where I just think silly stuff, but I'm just making this new distance

14:26.080 --> 14:27.910
pair values and finally passing it.

14:28.470 --> 14:32.260
Right now this coalition is over and let me quickly check if I have some errors.

14:34.650 --> 14:35.940
Undeclared identified.

14:37.840 --> 14:38.110
Okay.

14:38.110 --> 14:38.510
Sorry.

14:38.530 --> 14:38.740
Yeah.

14:39.460 --> 14:47.380
Now, this function has the complexity of the other DFS, because now we are calculating the maximum

14:47.380 --> 14:47.920
again and again.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.170
Now we are just using the max two values to calculate max eight.

14:52.690 --> 14:56.040
So this is a fairly enough working solution.

14:56.050 --> 15:02.500
I know it might be a little confusing, but this was important for me to tell you because problems like

15:02.500 --> 15:06.610
these can come the very simple case of rerouting of trees.

15:06.610 --> 15:10.300
If you want to read more about it, you can take the graph algorithms.

15:10.300 --> 15:15.850
Cause if you already have and if you don't have it, then you can do it on line in a rerouting of trees.

15:16.650 --> 15:17.040
And.

15:17.310 --> 15:17.600
Yeah.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.000
So you must have understood.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.940
What are the values that I'm calculating?

15:23.690 --> 15:25.250
So this part was very easy.

15:25.330 --> 15:27.350
A lot of reasons are three plus one.

15:27.710 --> 15:29.270
But what about the second part?

15:29.330 --> 15:33.530
The second part was stuff like how to calculate distance parent and four.

15:33.530 --> 15:39.050
And when we move downwards in the DFS, how to maintain the correct value of distance parent.

15:40.250 --> 15:43.300
How to formulate the new distance parent values better.

15:43.790 --> 15:45.440
So this was our tricky part and.

15:46.710 --> 15:48.840
Let's see in the next problem, Edwin.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.800
And in the next problem, we'll discuss something very interesting.

15:54.900 --> 15:55.260
Thank you.
