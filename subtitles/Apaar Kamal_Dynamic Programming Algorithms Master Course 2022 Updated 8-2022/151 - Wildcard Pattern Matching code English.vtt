WEBVTT

00:01.020 --> 00:01.250
Yeah.

00:01.350 --> 00:02.160
So here we are.

00:02.640 --> 00:08.190
We were just figuring out and not using these directly.

00:08.290 --> 00:12.570
Dirty diapers when they place on a blessed, blessed with these states not using them directly.

00:12.570 --> 00:13.770
We're using them indirectly.

00:14.250 --> 00:15.510
Made, for example.

00:16.950 --> 00:17.640
Or zero zero.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.020
This is a plus one.

00:19.140 --> 00:19.650
Plus one.

00:19.680 --> 00:28.050
This is a plus two +188 plus one de plus one is is i plus ou de plus one.

00:28.860 --> 00:31.950
So indirectly by using just these two states.

00:33.640 --> 00:33.970
Eight.

00:34.130 --> 00:38.680
Yeah, we are kind of figuring out all these other states.

00:38.950 --> 00:40.510
You're trying to make all these other state.

00:41.440 --> 00:46.240
Well, look, this was the only hard part of this problem.

00:46.840 --> 00:50.680
It is very hard to understand that.

00:50.770 --> 00:52.330
Why would this regulation work?

00:53.110 --> 00:54.370
Why would this regulation.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.460
Include all these other states.

01:00.050 --> 01:01.520
So now let's call it.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.650
It's called this.

01:03.710 --> 01:05.310
Okay, so this is all you'd go toward?

01:05.330 --> 01:05.750
A loser.

01:05.790 --> 01:07.580
Just forbid.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.770
And I go in, Sublime said.

01:12.040 --> 01:12.820
What we can do.

01:14.110 --> 01:15.520
And we have class solution.

01:15.520 --> 01:15.910
So.

01:17.530 --> 01:17.860
Let's.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.240
Let's stick to strings.

01:20.130 --> 01:21.700
I'm doubly.

01:23.270 --> 01:24.200
And stop.

01:25.070 --> 01:26.240
So let's take these doing.

01:27.230 --> 01:28.550
Was I genetically coded?

01:30.100 --> 01:30.940
Eliot Colbert.

01:30.940 --> 01:33.310
You will you can easily see.

01:34.390 --> 01:36.610
How to verify, cross-check, lead contamination.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.970
What we can do is we can simply say a solution which.

01:41.100 --> 01:41.850
It's the edge.

01:42.980 --> 01:45.980
He out at night is much.

01:47.280 --> 01:47.640
Right.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.100
And it's passed with strings in this SNP.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.370
I hope the main function is very clear to all of us.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.520
Now we have to call this matter out.

01:56.670 --> 02:02.220
So I'll also tell you some good ways of memorizing in the coalition class itself.

02:03.300 --> 02:06.470
What's the best, best way to memorize in this?

02:06.480 --> 02:08.010
Because we can't take things globally.

02:09.210 --> 02:10.440
You just have to complete a function.

02:12.030 --> 02:12.270
So.

02:13.880 --> 02:14.750
So here what we lose.

02:14.750 --> 02:19.730
Let's write a function called DP and let's pass S zero and J zero.

02:21.060 --> 02:24.210
And it's like old hippie.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.800
Entirely online.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.160
So this will be a bully prevention.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.440
That's our final repudiation that we have made.

02:34.830 --> 02:39.270
And we will also see the basic cases go before moving forward.

02:39.270 --> 02:41.820
But I will just take a string, of course.

02:41.820 --> 02:48.390
I think posturing is deference is great, but what I usually do is I'm just telling all of this that

02:48.390 --> 02:49.500
you learn something new today.

02:50.100 --> 02:50.880
What I see is.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.040
This part.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.750
That means the current as I have and string.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.710
It is equal to this, which is this.

02:58.740 --> 03:02.820
So basically I'm copying it and I'm copying it once.

03:03.720 --> 03:03.930
Okay.

03:03.990 --> 03:04.840
To be naughty.

03:04.920 --> 03:05.400
Let me do.

03:05.850 --> 03:06.330
Is it.

03:07.220 --> 03:07.660
E.

03:08.300 --> 03:08.760
E.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.100
And also.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.020
So assisting in perspective.

03:14.780 --> 03:17.810
And then this piece also, what is this?

03:17.810 --> 03:25.880
Is this, as is the coalition classes, this and this this particular thing is is this if you don't

03:25.880 --> 03:29.780
want to get confused, you can pick other names here like EPP or something.

03:30.530 --> 03:32.420
Well, so in this way, you will not get confused.

03:34.190 --> 03:36.020
Now, let's go to this.

03:36.080 --> 03:36.590
Depending.

03:38.020 --> 03:42.460
So whatever the case is, let's get back to the first cases.

03:43.400 --> 03:47.110
Let's let's make these cases first, this character cases in the kosher market.

03:48.320 --> 03:58.010
The first cases, if what was the case the character is a vessel is equal to PD excise equals to bd8.

03:58.310 --> 03:59.090
Then what we will do.

04:00.660 --> 04:05.400
If Assad is equal to PD, then iPads and DP i.e. plus one.

04:05.400 --> 04:12.420
Duplass one will take another boolean answer and Italy will make it false that there's no way to match

04:12.420 --> 04:12.630
it.

04:12.640 --> 04:12.930
Right.

04:13.080 --> 04:18.960
And then we for all the ways what we'll do is we'll take zero will take or if even if there's one way

04:18.960 --> 04:19.650
that matches it.

04:19.650 --> 04:19.770
I.

04:21.140 --> 04:24.290
Well, so it is d b I plus one comma.

04:24.870 --> 04:25.370
A-plus.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.810
I hope this is very clear.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.760
And this is the case when.

04:32.530 --> 04:33.990
I is listen as dirt.

04:34.510 --> 04:39.370
I use it and even do lesson periods as well.

04:39.610 --> 04:39.970
So.

04:41.220 --> 04:43.290
Let me right there also is lesson.

04:45.060 --> 04:48.030
I said, okay, so before writing this, just tell me.

04:48.920 --> 04:49.550
What if?

04:50.210 --> 04:54.170
What are the best cases so that we'll just figure out the best cases and then we'll light all these

04:54.170 --> 04:54.530
cases.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.600
I won't let me remove this once.

04:58.130 --> 04:58.370
Yeah.

04:58.610 --> 05:02.000
Let's figure out the best cases for the India moving forward.

05:02.940 --> 05:08.460
Eight of the cases when editors and office and when generated and off beat.

05:08.570 --> 05:11.120
What will happen when I reaches the end of S.A.T.?

05:11.120 --> 05:12.400
The end of it.

05:12.540 --> 05:19.760
So if I goes to his daughter's size and B equals two or three equals two period size.

05:21.050 --> 05:26.090
Then I learned to read because now they means they are two empty strings and these things are already

05:26.090 --> 05:26.450
missed.

05:26.480 --> 05:30.950
So we learned through our what if Jake was to be base?

05:31.430 --> 05:31.940
That means.

05:32.950 --> 05:33.280
Do.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.020
That means the pattern is ending.

05:35.260 --> 05:39.550
But there's some string to match, and that string will only contain characters, not contain.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.850
It will not contain stars in question marks.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.630
So it has some characters left, but writing is already finished.

05:47.050 --> 05:48.640
So will it end for great?

05:48.640 --> 05:49.990
Because there's no way to match it.

05:50.670 --> 05:56.860
Well, and what happens if it reaches emulated, i.e. reaches as dot size?

05:57.860 --> 06:03.430
That means B, that means somewhere independent and easily released today.

06:03.770 --> 06:06.530
In this case, we cannot see anything.

06:06.530 --> 06:06.830
Right?

06:07.070 --> 06:07.670
What if?

06:09.050 --> 06:16.430
What if all the characters after the dead character are stars or are stars right?

06:16.700 --> 06:21.560
All the stars we like not match with any of the characters, and it will be true.

06:21.890 --> 06:26.960
And what if all the characters are not stars and are some question marks or some other characters?

06:27.560 --> 06:28.850
And then it will be false.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.690
So for this case, it depends on the future answers.

06:33.890 --> 06:39.290
I will simply come in this case out and will not fix this case because we will handle this case later

06:39.290 --> 06:40.400
in order to.

06:41.990 --> 06:46.020
Right now, we know we are not handling this case when I say it.

06:46.020 --> 06:53.280
So we need to take care of this thing that I can all to be equal to Edward, say wherever I'm handling

06:53.280 --> 06:55.170
everything, what I'm doing, saving.

06:55.170 --> 06:55.980
You've been checking it.

06:56.310 --> 06:59.180
I have to make it less in instances.

07:00.530 --> 07:02.510
We have to specially check this.

07:03.260 --> 07:04.490
Well, so this is the first case.

07:05.390 --> 07:07.060
Again cases if.

07:08.750 --> 07:09.620
Let's see if.

07:10.510 --> 07:14.620
Dee d is equal to Bush and Mark.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.690
What, a few days it was to question mark.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.450
So is again a new thing, right?

07:20.480 --> 07:23.060
So if we do the crucial question mark, then there are two things.

07:23.480 --> 07:30.890
If either of those two instances, that means we've already reached the end of the string and we've

07:30.900 --> 07:31.730
got a question mark.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.380
I would simply return false.

07:35.300 --> 07:39.500
Great because this question mark and not anything because I has these.

07:40.820 --> 07:48.720
Otherwise, if I has not reached the end, I will simply say, okay, everyone, let's see on set or

07:48.720 --> 07:49.940
request to DP.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.590
It means this question mark is going to match exactly one character.

07:54.010 --> 07:57.280
Then let's get back Bush and Margaret.

07:58.180 --> 08:01.720
In this case, it will match exactly one character, the character that is met.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.160
And this question mark has been matched.

08:03.460 --> 08:05.220
It is a plus function multiple.

08:07.150 --> 08:10.110
Well, I'm just making all the cases individually.

08:10.210 --> 08:11.740
And the third case was the third case.

08:12.220 --> 08:14.350
Third case is when B.J. will be called to.

08:16.220 --> 08:26.120
Um got eight as is of and b they will be equal to not so as if b d is equal to start.

08:28.230 --> 08:30.450
What will happen when PDC wants to start?

08:30.990 --> 08:31.800
Anyone can.

08:31.980 --> 08:32.820
Yeah, you can.

08:32.820 --> 08:34.790
Also now code distinct ref.

08:34.830 --> 08:35.880
It is equal to a start.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.710
We just have to handle these two cases.

08:38.160 --> 08:38.460
Right?

08:38.460 --> 08:38.830
Matches.

08:38.830 --> 08:41.650
The character does not match the character or the guesses.

08:41.910 --> 08:42.180
Right?

08:42.630 --> 08:42.900
So.

08:45.020 --> 08:47.750
It will only matter character again.

08:47.780 --> 08:50.000
The same case if I goes to a storage space.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.220
That means there's no character to match it.

08:55.060 --> 09:00.070
So can can I see that if I is less than as long as I is, then only major character?

09:00.520 --> 09:00.830
Yes.

09:01.450 --> 09:04.600
If it is less than as are played the major character, how will it match your character?

09:04.600 --> 09:05.490
I bless one comma.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.080
Yeah, right.

09:07.420 --> 09:08.170
And what is this?

09:08.170 --> 09:08.670
A good case?

09:08.680 --> 09:09.610
The second in cases.

09:11.850 --> 09:12.450
Equal storm.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.290
R&amp;B.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.580
I got my zipless.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.250
When the second case I go major.

09:20.250 --> 09:22.170
Plus that means.

09:24.060 --> 09:28.330
It is not getting any better mean means dominate or what it means this aid.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.660
So these were the two guesses.

09:32.190 --> 09:38.190
I hope you're only confused by this if this is fair and anything else.

09:38.850 --> 09:44.820
This is very important to take to hand the light because we do not know about future characters in singers.

09:45.900 --> 09:48.840
That's why I wouldn't mind completing the case over here.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.910
It's what we have to handle.

09:51.210 --> 09:55.500
Whenever I'm handling I even if I'm doing a plus one, I have to handle this case.

09:56.450 --> 09:58.880
I use less than a source as well.

09:59.190 --> 10:06.450
So similarly here and in this case, I don't have to handle Iceland's instances because it is not incrementing.

10:06.450 --> 10:08.790
I start thinking I manage the current correctly.

10:09.270 --> 10:10.620
It just moving forward.

10:10.980 --> 10:12.810
This I can be an empty string as well.

10:13.390 --> 10:15.300
Just just take this case, for example.

10:16.170 --> 10:17.340
Let's say S is empty.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.020
And so as is this.

10:20.170 --> 10:22.210
And these guys.

10:22.210 --> 10:23.530
Star, star, star, star, star.

10:23.820 --> 10:24.670
And what will happen?

10:24.970 --> 10:26.590
I will remain here forever.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.990
And they will move forward.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.850
I will keep on moving, moving, moving, moving.

10:31.120 --> 10:36.160
In the end, what will happen either already at the end, they will in and it will return.

10:37.860 --> 10:44.490
When I'm digging or I'm digging, or because if any one of these parts written me true, then my answer

10:44.490 --> 10:44.670
is.

10:46.490 --> 10:47.280
Let me build it.

10:50.630 --> 10:50.840
Yeah.

10:50.930 --> 10:51.680
So I've got one.

10:51.830 --> 10:53.760
One means to.

10:54.730 --> 11:00.190
It is match is matches a boolean function D PDP is a boolean function.

11:01.450 --> 11:01.750
False.

11:01.750 --> 11:02.510
False was true.

11:02.530 --> 11:02.740
True.

11:02.740 --> 11:03.040
True.

11:03.250 --> 11:03.520
Yeah.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.170
And answer is boolean.

11:06.370 --> 11:06.880
This is true.

11:07.150 --> 11:08.020
And it has to be true.

11:08.050 --> 11:10.180
What if it is over eligibility?

11:12.210 --> 11:12.540
But.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.220
Well, and.

11:16.080 --> 11:21.900
Anything else nobody can do is let's have memorization in this and you'll see a new way of amazing things

11:21.900 --> 11:22.060
here.

11:22.960 --> 11:23.250
So.

11:24.520 --> 11:25.750
We are taking tests now.

11:26.320 --> 11:31.450
What we have to do is we have to take oh, of course we can pass it also, but we can.

11:32.410 --> 11:36.810
It's initiated over here on a vector of vector.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.710
And what is vector vector?

11:38.770 --> 11:39.640
It can be a 2D.

11:41.110 --> 11:43.540
So I'm digging in because we know.

11:43.540 --> 11:48.060
Right, although the function is boolean that this may be honest or true or false.

11:48.570 --> 11:49.500
But you remember it.

11:49.510 --> 11:53.110
We keep one thing which is not obvious, which is never done.

11:53.110 --> 11:54.710
So we just minus one other.

11:54.730 --> 11:55.420
I'm just keeping.

11:56.550 --> 11:57.030
In digital.

11:58.390 --> 11:59.470
Let's call it memo.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.890
And right now, memo is just an empty vector.

12:02.920 --> 12:10.150
So before moving forward, let's say memo eight four memo road releases and let's discuss it.

12:11.020 --> 12:13.120
The length of it will be called to assist or advice.

12:14.140 --> 12:14.350
Eight.

12:14.810 --> 12:16.000
Obama again.

12:16.150 --> 12:19.330
I need to fill a vector inside all the columns.

12:20.290 --> 12:21.730
This might be tricky to many of you.

12:22.150 --> 12:26.370
I'm just resizing this picture of actors, as George says wisely.

12:26.770 --> 12:29.560
And then in all those roles, what I have is.

12:30.710 --> 12:38.300
I have a new victory which is BP told size land of the victories this and I'll fill it with minus one

12:39.380 --> 12:39.760
meter.

12:41.020 --> 12:41.910
The right way or not.

12:42.540 --> 12:44.490
If it's the right way, it's working.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.500
So this is BP says column.

12:49.110 --> 12:52.400
Well, now, basically, after doing this resizing, I have a.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.930
It would be any structure.

12:58.000 --> 12:58.420
Well with.

13:00.560 --> 13:01.220
My innocence.

13:02.280 --> 13:07.830
Well, and now let's not pass it, because I've taken it over here.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.200
And what I will simply do is I say.

13:11.350 --> 13:17.740
If memo I did not equal two minus one written memo I.

13:18.310 --> 13:22.360
Otherwise it will return me, though I will just simply.

13:24.350 --> 13:25.220
David, over here.

13:27.510 --> 13:28.710
You can do this.

13:28.950 --> 13:29.760
What will you do now?

13:30.120 --> 13:31.620
Just memorize it.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.480
But you all might be wondering.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.560
That answer is boolean.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.640
And this is indeed.

13:36.120 --> 13:36.680
It doesn't matter.

13:36.680 --> 13:37.860
It will automatically convert.

13:38.770 --> 13:39.490
Gosford City.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.580
So let's build it and let's kick.

13:45.290 --> 13:49.490
And so, of course, I got some segmentation old.

13:52.560 --> 13:52.770
Okay.

13:52.770 --> 13:54.240
I'll look into this, but.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.120
I just updated.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.390
Let me quickly check out what's the problem here?

13:59.260 --> 13:59.570
Yeah.

13:59.650 --> 14:00.100
Got it.

14:00.370 --> 14:03.040
So a slightly tricky bird picker.

14:03.580 --> 14:09.730
So we're not taking for this case that either coast residents say is because we are checking it later.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.430
It means here I can be equal to Edwards size.

14:12.850 --> 14:18.910
But in the memo vector, what I've done is I've just taken it less than naught six eight.

14:18.910 --> 14:20.740
So I just add plus one over here.

14:21.040 --> 14:21.940
And just for the.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.390
Just for extra precaution.

14:24.390 --> 14:27.240
I'm just taking plus one over the head, isn't it because.

14:29.160 --> 14:34.360
This egg is not into the picture, so therefore I can be equal to side also.

14:35.460 --> 14:36.280
Now let's build.

14:37.480 --> 14:37.930
And.

14:39.590 --> 14:40.010
Nothing.

14:40.010 --> 14:43.550
Rendition falls and it will work so well for this.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.400
It's maybe we all are learning.

14:47.780 --> 14:48.950
And yeah.

14:48.980 --> 14:51.560
So this is a memories coalition.

14:51.590 --> 14:55.340
What you can do is you can just pick this solution class.

14:57.800 --> 15:01.100
But be it and directly pasted over here.

15:02.250 --> 15:04.500
Well, this isn't that awesome.

15:05.130 --> 15:09.000
We are going in sublime and indirectly we're wasting hidden.

15:10.230 --> 15:10.680
It could.

15:12.250 --> 15:12.500
Oh.

15:12.850 --> 15:14.470
And give everyone soon the next part.
