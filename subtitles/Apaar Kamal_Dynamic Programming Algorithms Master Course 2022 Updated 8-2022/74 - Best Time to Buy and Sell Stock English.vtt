00:00.770 --> 00:01.460
And everyone.

00:01.760 --> 00:03.930
So let's try this problem called.

00:03.970 --> 00:06.630
Best time to buy and sell stock for it.

00:07.010 --> 00:12.260
So it is going forward because there are some other versions of it, which is one, two, three and

00:12.260 --> 00:13.010
five also.

00:13.700 --> 00:17.000
Feel free to try all the versions that you want to.

00:17.390 --> 00:21.830
And I'm just taking this problem in this course because it's a dynamic programming problem.

00:22.260 --> 00:29.870
It will learn a lot in this because this is another type of partitioning problem where we have to pick

00:29.870 --> 00:34.460
something and then sell something and you know, we can do it exactly great times or get more skewed

00:34.460 --> 00:34.760
names.

00:35.330 --> 00:38.210
Let's see, you're given an integer area.

00:39.050 --> 00:47.270
Prices where prices are a is the price of the given stock on day eight and an integer find the maximum

00:47.270 --> 00:48.770
profit you can achieve.

00:49.160 --> 00:53.960
You may complete at most transaction very simple rate before everyday.

00:54.050 --> 00:56.330
You know the prices of this stock and.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.000
We have indicated this.

00:59.360 --> 01:05.570
It means I have the capacity of completing at most key transactions in a particular length rate.

01:05.810 --> 01:08.580
So this is a real life situation in this case.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.920
Transactions the.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.570
Foundation.

01:11.840 --> 01:12.320
It is.

01:12.740 --> 01:16.730
It is mostly like we cannot, you know, sell and buy again and again a lot of time.

01:17.240 --> 01:21.320
So there are donations here and these are small loans.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.310
And this is important.

01:22.580 --> 01:26.060
You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously.

01:26.390 --> 01:29.270
That is, you must sell the stock before you buy again.

01:30.330 --> 01:31.050
Very easy, right?

01:31.740 --> 01:36.890
That means if you have purchased this dog, you must sell it first and then only you can buy it in in

01:36.900 --> 01:37.340
this stock.

01:38.520 --> 01:42.250
So you cannot buy two stocks first and then sell it later.

01:42.330 --> 01:48.150
But of course, feel free to try the problem, even if, let's say, the node was not there and you

01:48.150 --> 01:50.890
are allowed to buy multiple stocks and then sell them later.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.230
Just feel free to try the problem that way.

01:53.230 --> 01:53.490
Right.

01:53.790 --> 01:54.990
It will be a new problem for.

01:57.130 --> 01:59.230
In Buddhist to a letter case to in price.

01:59.230 --> 02:00.970
It is true for one low.

02:02.590 --> 02:07.140
What is clear here is the number of up at most gate on the auction.

02:07.480 --> 02:12.370
What is the transaction here but just are discussing this very quickly.

02:12.670 --> 02:19.140
Let's understand of this understanding but first is to so to for one day that means outward is to why

02:19.140 --> 02:25.940
is output to because you buy on day one and sell only to basically I but is it for to rupees I said

02:26.020 --> 02:31.210
it for for would be so it is give me a profit of one minus to is to eight.

02:31.630 --> 02:34.000
Similarly for here we have get goes to to.

02:34.900 --> 02:35.660
Crisis.

02:36.550 --> 02:39.940
Idly you saw that we performed two transactions.

02:40.390 --> 02:47.230
But when I see that selling is one transaction and buying is one transaction, or selling and buying

02:47.470 --> 02:49.060
the same stock is one transaction.

02:49.660 --> 02:51.670
So that's a good question because.

02:52.620 --> 02:55.590
This question only makes this partisan problem.

02:55.620 --> 02:57.090
Let's hope so.

02:57.450 --> 03:00.160
Let's to the second input and it is gigawatts to do.

03:00.180 --> 03:00.930
These are the prices.

03:01.020 --> 03:02.220
So what's the explanation?

03:02.220 --> 03:05.920
Explanation sees you buy only two and sell on day three eight.

03:05.940 --> 03:11.700
So this is give me a for profit while then you buy only five and sell on the.

03:14.110 --> 03:17.550
Six eight that means now is giving a profit of three.

03:17.560 --> 03:20.520
So the total properties three replace parade.

03:20.530 --> 03:27.880
So now here you can see if I see that selling is one transaction and purchasing is another transaction,

03:27.880 --> 03:28.930
then the profit is.

03:29.140 --> 03:35.140
But then the total number of transactions is bought but the total transactions allowed it to write to.

03:35.260 --> 03:41.310
From this, I understood that one transaction is equal to one buy plus one sell eight.

03:41.470 --> 03:42.940
So that's what if I'm performing?

03:43.120 --> 03:48.040
Let's say I picked up something, I purchased it and I sell it after some point of time.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.090
That's one partition of the 88.

03:50.260 --> 03:53.080
So after that I have to decide what the remaining at it.

03:53.110 --> 03:55.510
Now let's I have j minus one transactions to make.

03:55.900 --> 03:56.950
Now tell me what.

03:57.910 --> 03:59.380
Is the maximum profit you're getting.

04:01.170 --> 04:04.240
This problem seems very simple.

04:04.240 --> 04:07.030
And let's figure out the dynamic programming state.

04:08.300 --> 04:09.050
So let's see.

04:10.020 --> 04:10.310
Okay.

04:11.370 --> 04:15.570
3265038.

04:15.860 --> 04:17.760
So basically, what does the problem see?

04:18.270 --> 04:20.030
What any particular day?

04:20.040 --> 04:21.120
I have three options.

04:21.630 --> 04:22.980
So the what is the first option?

04:24.010 --> 04:26.260
I can not do anything.

04:26.290 --> 04:28.360
Neither Biden nor right wing.

04:28.390 --> 04:29.140
Neither by.

04:32.350 --> 04:40.720
Not that it's so this is one that means I can I can leave some partitions empty also that I'm not performing

04:40.720 --> 04:42.420
any transactions in that regard.

04:43.010 --> 04:47.050
Second option for any of these items that I can have is I'll buy it.

04:47.560 --> 04:48.760
You can buy the item.

04:49.980 --> 04:55.170
By the item, by this destock and what is the condition in buying?

04:55.200 --> 04:59.310
You can have this one condition that is previously.

04:59.310 --> 05:00.810
You must not have buy any stock.

05:00.820 --> 05:02.340
Then only you can buy the current stock.

05:02.340 --> 05:02.640
Right.

05:03.090 --> 05:03.390
So.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.540
So basically, let's say.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.070
I went.

05:10.540 --> 05:11.170
Anything.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.290
Then only I can buy this stock.

05:13.300 --> 05:17.810
And the second condition is you have transaction, which this case should be greater than or equal to

05:17.810 --> 05:18.010
one.

05:19.020 --> 05:19.410
Correct.

05:19.470 --> 05:22.710
If you have transactions, then only you can buy a stock grade and the sacredness.

05:23.400 --> 05:23.730
Okay.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.770
The third point here is you can sell the stock.

05:26.680 --> 05:30.460
And sell the current stock or any of these all.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.440
We have all these three options with some conditions.

05:32.890 --> 05:33.090
Okay.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.630
So when can I sell the stock?

05:35.700 --> 05:38.700
I can only sell the stock if I have buy.

05:39.060 --> 05:40.350
If I buy the stock.

05:40.770 --> 05:46.440
If I bought the stock late or if I bought the stock previously, then only if bought.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.080
I can sell this dog, right?

05:51.320 --> 05:57.350
So in this case, I'm not adding greater than or equal to one buy, because if I have bought a stock,

05:57.380 --> 05:59.300
that means give us greater than equal to one.

05:59.930 --> 06:04.530
So when I sell the stock, I simply remove K by one h.

06:04.610 --> 06:08.690
So what I'm doing is at the time of purchasing, I'm not.

06:09.710 --> 06:10.670
Implementing it.

06:10.790 --> 06:12.710
I'm saying, okay, opportunity did great.

06:12.950 --> 06:18.870
When you sell, I just make k minus one rule, then I'll remove one transaction it.

06:20.230 --> 06:22.540
So in this case, I can take a close to minus four.

06:23.290 --> 06:29.800
That means I have absolute and I have moved on and I made one transaction.

06:30.730 --> 06:37.290
So when I start from the first review, what I'll say is, okay, let, let me take.

06:38.570 --> 06:38.890
Okay.

06:38.900 --> 06:46.370
DP The second thing is, I want to know whether I purchase the stock or basically I want to know whether

06:46.370 --> 06:50.380
I want to sell the current stock or I want to buy the current stock, right?

06:50.570 --> 06:53.300
So here I can use a boolean value.

06:53.390 --> 06:54.350
It's called Boolean.

06:55.380 --> 06:58.140
And let's each bite which will tell me.

06:58.290 --> 07:02.130
So if my is true, that means I can only buy this current stock, right?

07:02.670 --> 07:08.700
If by false that means I can only sell the current stock because I've already purchased something.

07:09.480 --> 07:15.030
So I just ask some boolean value by which is which will tell me whether I can buy or sell the current

07:15.030 --> 07:15.330
stock.

07:15.980 --> 07:18.380
This first option is can can be performed.

07:18.390 --> 07:21.570
I can neither buy or sell the stock if I want to write.

07:22.480 --> 07:28.210
But the but these two options depend on one thing that is, I can only pursue this talk if I haven't

07:28.210 --> 07:28.690
bought it.

07:29.110 --> 07:31.480
That means this whole buy should be false.

07:32.790 --> 07:35.340
But it would be should be through eight.

07:35.580 --> 07:40.310
So through that means I'm going to buy the stock and sell the stock if bought.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.120
That means in this case, buy should be false.

07:42.120 --> 07:42.360
Right.

07:42.660 --> 07:46.170
And the third thing is get the number of transactions I have left to make.

07:48.350 --> 07:53.930
Here I have these three conditions, but all these values, I'll just perform these three conditions.

07:53.930 --> 07:55.700
And let me just quickly write.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.440
What does the current state mean?

07:57.860 --> 07:59.030
It just means for.

08:01.280 --> 08:01.610
Let's.

08:01.610 --> 08:02.300
Let's go.

08:03.240 --> 08:03.710
Hmm.

08:04.330 --> 08:04.660
Okay.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.100
So for the.

08:07.940 --> 08:08.750
Prices.

08:10.400 --> 08:19.230
I do a fix of all the remaining Eddie the left Eddie from starting from my two and eight for these are

08:19.360 --> 08:20.020
for this area.

08:20.410 --> 08:23.060
Tell me what's the best.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.030
Best profit.

08:31.750 --> 08:37.310
If I you know, if I buy or sell it, this will decide the current element.

08:37.310 --> 08:38.020
This will decide.

08:38.020 --> 08:40.270
And this really is 85.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.250
How many transactions?

08:41.260 --> 08:41.470
Right.

08:41.470 --> 08:42.310
So if I have.

08:43.410 --> 08:44.430
Their transactions.

08:46.640 --> 08:47.210
Possible.

08:48.860 --> 08:55.610
Or instead okay let's say at most transactions possible late because I can also make zero transaction.

08:57.030 --> 08:59.490
It said the adage is increasing only.

08:59.910 --> 09:02.280
That means I have to perform some zero transactions.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.290
Otherwise my answer will be negative.

09:05.820 --> 09:07.020
I can perform zero transactions.

09:07.020 --> 09:08.210
I don't want to win loss.

09:08.220 --> 09:10.710
It's only asking about the profit or loss rate.

09:13.400 --> 09:18.890
So for the first part, I'm in this part, what would be are the girls evolution.

09:19.070 --> 09:24.560
If I'm if I'm on some particular value and whatever is the value of whether I'm buying it or selling

09:24.560 --> 09:24.740
it.

09:25.130 --> 09:30.290
Like if I'm on the selling video buying spree and decade on the Sinclair right.

09:30.800 --> 09:35.450
And I don't want to do another sell or buy this dog, then what I can do is I can simply say.

09:36.510 --> 09:36.840
That.

09:36.850 --> 09:37.470
Okay.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.280
Don't worry.

09:38.550 --> 09:41.540
Just tell me if I'm not buying or selling.

09:41.640 --> 09:42.330
Just tell me.

09:43.370 --> 09:44.390
I just simply ignored it.

09:44.390 --> 09:44.610
Right?

09:44.990 --> 09:51.720
I simply say, okay, from this cell from the next day, they just tell me whatever the values was via

09:52.100 --> 09:54.020
was in, let's say this fall, then it will be false.

09:54.350 --> 09:55.190
If it is true, that is true.

09:55.190 --> 09:55.400
Right?

09:55.400 --> 09:57.230
Because I'm either selling it and or buying it.

09:57.530 --> 10:00.790
The state remains the same and getting into eight.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.200
This will be the state for the first case.

10:03.890 --> 10:07.700
What about the second case in which I'm buying this stock?

10:08.090 --> 10:10.180
For the second case, there should be two conditions.

10:10.190 --> 10:12.500
That is, case should be greater than equal to.

10:13.490 --> 10:13.880
One.

10:14.930 --> 10:20.830
And the second condition is I should be able to do.

10:21.920 --> 10:22.190
Right.

10:22.520 --> 10:27.470
But when this is when both these conditions are true, then what I'll do is will simply say, okay,

10:28.070 --> 10:29.920
let's buy this stock right?

10:29.960 --> 10:33.680
When I'm buying a stock, that means I am actually.

10:34.710 --> 10:35.640
Or choosing a name.

10:35.640 --> 10:39.150
That means my profit is going in the negative because I am purchasing it right now.

10:39.750 --> 10:42.790
That means I'm spending the money when I'm buying a stock.

10:42.810 --> 10:43.830
I just subtracted.

10:44.400 --> 10:50.400
As you can see in the example, if I posted the stock of price to say I'm the same for minus two rate.

10:50.610 --> 10:52.500
What I'll do is I say minus prices.

10:53.630 --> 10:54.560
You then put using it.

10:54.560 --> 10:58.610
My property is going in negative right now because I've partnered with my money's going rate.

10:59.150 --> 11:01.130
The minus price is a plus.

11:01.340 --> 11:08.330
Now tell me, what is the best answer for the remaining at it for the remaining days if I want to.

11:09.580 --> 11:10.770
Sell right for sale.

11:10.780 --> 11:11.920
What I can say is false.

11:12.670 --> 11:15.190
I will be false not because I want to sell it.

11:15.700 --> 11:22.500
And the transactions will be given the right now because I said right when I performed one by invention,

11:22.510 --> 11:24.130
then I remove K by one.

11:24.760 --> 11:28.180
So let's make key as it is.

11:28.690 --> 11:31.200
Well, for the third case, case should be okay.

11:31.220 --> 11:33.890
We don't have a condition of 4K on the third case.

11:33.890 --> 11:34.140
Right.

11:34.600 --> 11:39.580
Because if I have bought it and I'm selling it if buy is equal to false.

11:41.020 --> 11:45.820
That means I want to sell it to everybody that goes before it's compulsory that gay should have been

11:45.820 --> 11:47.290
greater than equal to one earlier.

11:47.320 --> 11:51.850
That's why I'm able to say I was able to purchase the stock and I'm selling it.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.470
In this case, what will happen?

11:53.470 --> 11:56.230
I will add, because now I want to sell the current stock.

11:56.230 --> 11:57.120
I say prices.

11:57.790 --> 12:00.340
Plus a be a plus one.

12:00.340 --> 12:02.710
And now again, I want to buy a stock.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.010
Eight.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.540
And transactions remain by.

12:07.150 --> 12:09.630
Tell me, what's the best answer for the remaining area?

12:09.630 --> 12:13.350
If I want to now buy this stock and the transactions are k minus one.

12:14.710 --> 12:18.850
So this is my very simple recursive relation that I have had to do.

12:19.120 --> 12:24.250
And what it will do is it will actually buy stock somewhere, sell it somewhere.

12:24.250 --> 12:29.020
That will be one partition of memory and buy this stock somewhere else, sell it somewhere else, and

12:29.020 --> 12:30.970
there will be another partition of it.

12:31.450 --> 12:32.560
Basically, it is dividing.

12:32.560 --> 12:33.850
Okay, let me give you an example.

12:34.360 --> 12:35.500
Me make things more clear.

12:36.220 --> 12:39.040
What 326503.

12:39.050 --> 12:39.250
What?

12:39.250 --> 12:39.730
I have.

12:40.300 --> 12:40.930
I have.

12:41.950 --> 12:42.850
Yeah, this.

12:43.830 --> 12:44.940
This is one partition.

12:45.450 --> 12:46.440
Here I am, doing nothing.

12:47.350 --> 12:47.650
Here.

12:47.650 --> 12:49.990
I purchased it, and here I sold it.

12:51.140 --> 12:52.160
Again here.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.450
I'm doing nothing here.

12:53.450 --> 12:55.070
I purchased it and here I sold it.

12:55.790 --> 12:59.030
And so this C -0 and six minus two and it is giving me seven.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.800
So you can see that.

13:01.070 --> 13:03.830
How good is dynamic programming?

13:03.830 --> 13:05.000
It can help.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.530
You saw lots of problems.

13:07.430 --> 13:11.610
Well, here this this condition is not satisfied, right?

13:11.630 --> 13:14.540
That is and it's not mentioned in the problem.

13:14.540 --> 13:17.550
That is the partitions should be continuous eight.

13:17.630 --> 13:23.690
For example, if I'm buying a stock, I'm selling it, then I have to buy it in stock and then sell

13:23.690 --> 13:24.170
it later.

13:24.890 --> 13:28.610
That means I cannot there shouldn't be the days where I'm not.

13:28.670 --> 13:31.580
There should only be a partition, which I'm completely skipping.

13:32.400 --> 13:32.640
Eight.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.580
So what if you try that problem yourself?

13:35.640 --> 13:36.450
Just think about it.

13:36.900 --> 13:37.320
Maybe.

13:37.320 --> 13:38.160
Maybe that is.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.380
Best time to buy and sell stock five.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.090
I'm not sure, but maybe it is.

13:43.330 --> 13:49.180
But just I we understood the follow problem of this and there shouldn't be any partitions which remain.

13:50.230 --> 13:50.740
Empty.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.790
The complete partition that remains empty.

13:55.150 --> 13:57.760
So every all the partition should be continues.

13:59.090 --> 13:59.430
Eight.

13:59.450 --> 14:01.700
So it scored it in the next fight.

14:01.820 --> 14:02.210
Thank you.
