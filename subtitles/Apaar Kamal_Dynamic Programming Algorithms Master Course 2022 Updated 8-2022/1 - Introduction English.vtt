Hello and welcome everyone to the Dynamic Programming Master Course.

1
00:04.340 --> 00:06.680
The only course you need to master DP.

2
00:07.430 --> 00:07.700
Hi.

3
00:07.730 --> 00:12.140
I'm Apaar, I'm a software engineer at Google and course  instructor at coding minutes.

4
00:12.560 --> 00:16.820
We also have Prateek Bhaiya founder of Coding Minutes and engineering lead at SCALAR.

5
00:17.930 --> 00:21.080
Coding minutes is a group of engineers who love to teach.

6
00:21.650 --> 00:26.820
We have created several top notch highest rated as well as bestseller courses on udemy

7
00:27.260 --> 00:28.400
Feel free to check them out.

8
00:29.210 --> 00:30.740
Let's talk more about this course.

9
00:31.400 --> 00:33.210
In my long teaching career.

10
00:33.230 --> 00:39.350
I see that dynamic programming is one concept, but it has various implementations.

11
00:39.740 --> 00:46.100
So I have divided this course into modules based on their implementation of dynamic programming.

12
00:46.640 --> 00:54.230
Furthermore, this will help us detect problems and dive deeper into dynamic programming and its variations.

13
00:55.290 --> 00:57.270
This course has lots of benefits.

14
00:57.540 --> 01:03.420
We will solve very simple as well as advanced level dynamic programming problems, which will ultimately

15
01:03.420 --> 01:07.980
help you boost your confidence in online and live coding rounds.

16
01:09.190 --> 01:09.910
This course.

17
01:09.910 --> 01:12.640
Also, this course is a 40 plus hours.

18
01:13.090 --> 01:16.210
Such well-structured and designed content.

19
01:16.960 --> 01:23.170
We have also shared the live links of practice problems across various computer programming platforms

20
01:23.410 --> 01:25.300
such as leetcode and codeforces

21
01:25.810 --> 01:32.050
This course also shares some very less known topics, which will give you an edge over others.

22
01:32.410 --> 01:35.920
Also, we will live code all the problems that will be discussed in this course.

23
01:37.550 --> 01:38.690
Who can join this course. correct

24
01:39.530 --> 01:46.700
Anyone with a knack of programming is eligible to join this course, but fundamental knowledge of basic

25
01:46.700 --> 01:48.980
data structures and algorithms is a must.

26
01:49.980 --> 01:54.150
So are you ready for some heavy problem lifting?

27
01:55.430 --> 01:55.930
All right.

28
01:55.970 --> 01:58.280
Wishing you all the best and see you in the course.

29
01:58.760 --> 01:59.210
Thank you.
