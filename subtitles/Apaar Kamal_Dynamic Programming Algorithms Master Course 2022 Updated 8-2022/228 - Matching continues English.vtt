WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:03.580
So when good match with a boat two and three.

00:04.530 --> 00:07.410
So what possibilities do one have to be matched with?

00:07.650 --> 00:10.560
The first one is either take one, one that is Assad.

00:10.590 --> 00:11.930
They won't do that is match.

00:11.940 --> 00:14.340
WOMAN two So what should be an exit?

00:14.430 --> 00:15.270
Okay, go on.

00:15.270 --> 00:18.960
And now match men two With women.

00:20.160 --> 00:26.070
And what is the state of illegal said will be the ordinance which may amend when and now he has managed

00:26.190 --> 00:29.430
to write or two won't be available for the second men to be met.

00:29.450 --> 00:30.960
So this is one possibility.

00:30.960 --> 00:35.700
And towards the second possibility it is the B2 Goma one and.

00:39.350 --> 00:44.870
331 into that means now match man one has been matched with women.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.350
So this is another possibility.

00:47.610 --> 00:48.710
So let me come back.

00:49.100 --> 00:49.370
Yeah.

00:49.610 --> 00:49.940
So.

00:49.940 --> 00:51.890
MAN one Can we measure two and three?

00:52.550 --> 00:53.570
Just give me a second again.

00:54.230 --> 00:54.490
Yeah.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.090
So here we can see that.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.750
Men, two, three men.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.400
One has been matched with two and three.

01:01.400 --> 01:01.760
Both.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.400
So now what are the women?

01:04.310 --> 01:06.730
They are left like one entry slip and one into his left.

01:06.750 --> 01:07.010
Right.

01:07.220 --> 01:08.690
Well, it's a man.

01:08.870 --> 01:13.820
Let's try to match man two with the woman of eight.

01:14.060 --> 01:14.870
So let's see.

01:14.870 --> 01:18.020
With a man two is compatible with woman one and three.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.930
So of course, here, both of them will be matched.

01:21.260 --> 01:23.100
Let me say that.

01:23.150 --> 01:27.680
Okay, now management three because two is already matched with one and here two is matched with the

01:27.680 --> 01:30.730
reason I'm writing a basic, basic regression rate.

01:30.770 --> 01:33.770
Nothing is digging a set of woman and all those things.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.260
This should be very clear.

01:35.270 --> 01:37.640
It's nothing right now.

01:37.820 --> 01:39.980
Men, not three, will be matched with three.

01:40.850 --> 01:46.010
So the woman left this to you now at eight because you win when already matched in this case.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.710
DP Here what we have is we have three.

01:49.160 --> 01:53.510
You'll be matched with one now because who has been matched with three?

01:53.510 --> 01:53.610
So.

01:53.630 --> 01:54.460
Woman three Taken.

01:54.470 --> 01:55.550
So basically it is like this.

01:55.550 --> 01:59.610
Their group of men come up, men and women, where woman is a sick eight.

01:59.660 --> 02:02.480
And if I try to match men, I.

02:02.960 --> 02:03.620
I can only.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.420
Okay, I'll take that later.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.230
Define their later so they don't just understand brute force.

02:09.590 --> 02:10.430
It should be better.

02:10.880 --> 02:17.180
Now what I have is okay so far for women two again, what I have is it can be measured.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.500
WOMAN one in three.

02:18.860 --> 02:20.450
Men two can only imagine.

02:21.110 --> 02:24.200
Women One in the nature here I cannot imagine.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.330
Two So let's ignore the second arrow.

02:27.190 --> 02:34.960
And here I have management with my city manager, with women one so that I know that you can match mentally

02:34.960 --> 02:35.590
with women.

02:36.370 --> 02:38.560
But eight So this is the same, which is.

02:39.770 --> 02:41.210
But which is remaining.

02:41.780 --> 02:42.950
I hope this is very clear.

02:43.530 --> 02:44.610
Well, now.

02:45.640 --> 02:45.910
Now.

02:46.570 --> 02:46.660
Now.

02:47.060 --> 02:48.860
Will this match to the entry?

02:49.780 --> 02:52.270
Can we take this that military entry match or not?

02:52.990 --> 02:53.360
Yes.

02:53.380 --> 02:56.110
So three matches with all three tournament matches with all three.

02:56.110 --> 03:00.520
So this will be done as one because yes, this is a possibility that, yes, they have been matched.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.090
This is, again, a possibility.

03:02.090 --> 03:03.430
Yes, they have been also matched.

03:03.670 --> 03:05.140
And this is, again, a possibility.

03:05.140 --> 03:06.130
So one comes from here.

03:06.850 --> 03:07.810
One comes from here.

03:07.930 --> 03:15.460
And this this will return a stool because he has matched a woman, a man, two with one also and with

03:15.940 --> 03:16.450
three also.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.170
This will also return me one.

03:18.310 --> 03:19.540
This will also alternate done me one.

03:19.540 --> 03:24.100
And this finally I will be returned to the it two from it and one from you.

03:24.990 --> 03:27.490
I we are getting this a normal brute force, nothing else.

03:27.670 --> 03:31.040
Instead, it goes in starting from end one, matching with all the women.

03:31.060 --> 03:31.360
What?

03:31.360 --> 03:32.990
India said eight.

03:34.590 --> 03:34.830
So.

03:35.940 --> 03:36.200
Yeah.

03:36.270 --> 03:36.870
So let me.

03:39.180 --> 03:43.550
Right this that b b off like this is what we understood.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.630
Edward of Luisa said off.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.120
Woman.

03:48.790 --> 03:49.330
Let's say.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.370
Not available.

03:51.880 --> 03:52.150
Eight.

03:54.390 --> 03:55.320
I'm trying to match.

03:56.130 --> 03:57.420
I'm trying to match men.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.340
I m sorry.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.370
Match men m with vitamin citrate.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.310
And this this will be equal to.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.540
Let's see if I'm not finding the number of these number office.

04:10.580 --> 04:10.850
Okay.

04:11.060 --> 04:16.190
So basically the BMW is there to get these many, many remaining men from M.

04:17.260 --> 04:21.820
To end all remaining and women remaining white in this thread.

04:21.820 --> 04:22.240
For now.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.700
Hate to tell me what the number of is.

04:24.970 --> 04:25.960
It's a normally beast.

04:26.050 --> 04:28.660
It it will be equal to submission of.

04:29.900 --> 04:37.550
Bibi and plus one because I'm matching the government with women minus something like 646 excusable

04:37.610 --> 04:44.720
men with which men end mismatched right now and x x belongs to w.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.560
First of all, they w was the third x belongs to W and.

04:49.570 --> 04:53.680
The second condition was that eof m coma x should be true.

04:54.250 --> 04:57.550
That means man m should be comfortable with women.

04:58.540 --> 05:01.620
So this is a normal recursive relation that we have formed.

05:01.630 --> 05:03.850
This shouldn't be that hard to understand.

05:09.130 --> 05:15.070
Well, I imagine contentment and it will be matched with all those women whom we that it is compatible

05:15.070 --> 05:16.860
and they are available in the set.

05:16.870 --> 05:24.010
That means X belongs to W and Emma and Eve exists when they are compatible.

05:25.030 --> 05:25.830
Good luck.

05:25.870 --> 05:33.220
In the next part of this we will code the first voice and then we will understand that vivo brute force

05:33.220 --> 05:34.570
working then will coordinate.

05:34.570 --> 05:36.370
We approach and optimize it.

05:36.760 --> 05:37.030
Okay.

05:37.210 --> 05:37.900
So thank you very.
