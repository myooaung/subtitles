WEBVTT

00:00.430 --> 00:00.580
Right.

00:00.830 --> 00:05.090
So in the last section we understood what articulation points in bridges be understood.

00:05.090 --> 00:07.340
What is their discovery time of a particular node?

00:07.550 --> 00:09.170
When it was discovered in their dances.

00:09.800 --> 00:15.070
Now, in this section we will understand about what is the lowest time?

00:15.080 --> 00:16.520
What does the lowest time mean?

00:16.910 --> 00:17.210
Right.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.340
So it's a new term for most of us guys.

00:20.830 --> 00:22.540
But it is a must.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.520
It is a new dawn for most of us.

00:24.520 --> 00:32.300
And but we need during the standard and then after understanding, will figure out how to calculate

00:33.100 --> 00:35.560
rate, how to find it in my algorithm.

00:35.590 --> 00:35.980
Right.

00:36.190 --> 00:42.490
And then after that, it will understand how to use it to find out when temperatures will rise.

00:42.550 --> 00:43.150
So.

00:44.570 --> 00:45.170
Get ready.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.600
And this is the most important part of our revolution.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.710
Boynton Beach is Lewiston.

00:49.820 --> 00:50.180
Right.

00:50.570 --> 00:56.810
So just quickly reminding you all we have found it is every time we have a media structure of back and

00:56.810 --> 00:59.660
address this by just giving them levels.

01:00.120 --> 01:00.380
Right.

01:01.080 --> 01:01.400
So.

01:01.910 --> 01:06.920
Well, look, now let's start from Lewiston, okay.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.550
Well, so before this, I just wanted you to discuss one thing.

01:12.090 --> 01:15.900
You guys, there are, of course, are similar ways of finding articulation points in bridges that I

01:15.900 --> 01:18.030
want more the approach we have already included.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.290
If you want to find an original regulation point or not, just remove it from the graph.

01:22.440 --> 01:27.120
There was a graph check if the number of connected component increased or not, and then the more connected

01:27.120 --> 01:30.930
component increased, then simply there is in our relation point.

01:30.930 --> 01:31.200
Right.

01:31.530 --> 01:36.030
So if I were to define node all articulation points in the graph, then what I need to do is I need

01:36.030 --> 01:38.430
to do the same for all the node eight.

01:39.340 --> 01:44.410
What again and again, like construct a graph without a note, taking some of the connected components.

01:44.950 --> 01:46.810
Who goes for that particular?

01:48.510 --> 01:53.400
Algorithm like actually calculating connected components for all the different nodes.

01:53.790 --> 01:56.470
How much complexity are we taking?

01:56.490 --> 01:58.260
What is the complexity we are using here?

01:59.210 --> 01:59.720
It is.

02:01.960 --> 02:02.560
Often.

02:04.300 --> 02:09.190
Because finding an American agreement wouldn't stick over anything but ending it off.

02:10.150 --> 02:11.860
And we are doing this for all the notes.

02:12.980 --> 02:16.550
Hey, we are removing a node and then checking them.

02:16.550 --> 02:19.780
We're connecting communities and we're doing this for all the nodes in the original graph.

02:20.090 --> 02:21.620
So what is the total complexity?

02:21.980 --> 02:23.540
The total complexity then squared.

02:24.410 --> 02:24.680
Okay.

02:25.160 --> 02:30.800
So if the total complexity wasn't squared from the normal algorithm and of course, if you see this

02:30.800 --> 02:34.940
problem to find some articulation points in bridges, of course the problem would directly say that

02:34.940 --> 02:37.850
you have to find articulation points in bridges, but in a.

02:37.850 --> 02:38.350
Like a.

02:40.520 --> 02:44.990
You know -- well we're asking you to find articulation, points and bridges.

02:45.350 --> 02:47.730
Then you should first take constraints.

02:47.750 --> 02:51.680
If the constraints are like that, the algorithm works for and squared.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.670
Also they constraints are really low.

02:53.690 --> 02:56.990
Then you can use the normal approach, the very basic approach.

02:57.770 --> 03:03.530
MARTIN From today programming context, the best approach is always just, okay, so.

03:04.480 --> 03:04.930
Here.

03:05.020 --> 03:10.900
What we're trying to do is we are trying to cover all the articulation points in but a decent off and

03:10.900 --> 03:13.780
time modern squared off.

03:13.780 --> 03:18.940
And then we are trying to actually figure out how to find those articulation points and bridges in a

03:18.940 --> 03:19.270
graph.

03:20.080 --> 03:20.320
Well.

03:21.350 --> 03:25.370
So I hope you understood why we are actually doing all these things.

03:25.950 --> 03:26.720
It just to.

03:27.650 --> 03:34.130
Producer Dan complexity and that's that's all which is required from us in a computer programming context.

03:34.550 --> 03:34.860
Right.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.550
And for those who are like prepping for interviews.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.650
Or demonstrate is a must see.

03:40.680 --> 03:45.300
Of course you can do it in a by brute force approach, but literally some of the guys with telling the

03:45.300 --> 03:47.760
same thing with a better approach of ending.

03:47.970 --> 03:52.310
And he understood and understood the concept in a very lenawee.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.650
A And the concept is also not that big, right?

03:56.010 --> 03:59.250
So if you understood the concept in a very clean away and he's able to like.

04:01.170 --> 04:03.240
Share his thoughts in offering time.

04:03.240 --> 04:08.850
Only then of course he will be preferred for because he has a better than complexity.

04:10.300 --> 04:15.870
So let's come back to the Lewis team and let's figure out what is the lowest time and how to calculate

04:15.870 --> 04:16.020
it.

04:16.510 --> 04:16.760
Right.

04:17.520 --> 04:19.600
So here is the main part, guys.

04:20.100 --> 04:20.780
What is the lowest?

04:21.810 --> 04:23.550
It is a discovered time of a node.

04:25.170 --> 04:31.080
ULRICH We can traverse by using at most one baggage in the current subject.

04:32.720 --> 04:32.930
Right.

04:33.450 --> 04:37.260
So let me put some commas here.

04:39.790 --> 04:43.200
By using at most one package in the current subject.

04:44.080 --> 04:44.890
What is the lowest?

04:44.890 --> 04:49.960
I mean that if I'm on or if I'm on some particular node, I'm going in.

04:49.960 --> 04:50.710
It's subtree.

04:50.710 --> 04:52.880
So we have already performed a DFS three eight.

04:53.030 --> 04:55.120
I know we have already performed a DFS.

04:55.930 --> 04:58.120
We have already stored the discovery down to the nodes.

04:58.270 --> 05:02.980
Well, what is the lowest time of a node if I go in it subtree?

05:03.880 --> 05:05.200
Late in the day history.

05:05.200 --> 05:11.230
Of course I go inside subtree, and from the subtree of it I am able to just.

05:12.280 --> 05:16.180
Move to only one package I want to destroy.

05:16.180 --> 05:17.700
I want to own one package.

05:17.720 --> 05:18.000
Right.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.040
They going through one package only ones.

05:21.910 --> 05:27.550
Eight means if I have a package that is binding from 2 to 5, some variable and I'm just moving from

05:27.550 --> 05:30.480
2 to 5, I'm not going submit above eight.

05:30.550 --> 05:33.170
I'm just reversing that back as nothing, is it?

05:33.730 --> 05:36.970
If there are lots of packages in my current subtree, that means.

05:38.910 --> 05:40.140
The minimum one rate.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.070
So it is the.

05:42.460 --> 05:49.670
Minimum discovered time off an old rule which began drivers by using at most one edge in the current

05:49.690 --> 05:50.280
arbitrary rate.

05:50.290 --> 05:51.600
Of course, I'll be giving examples.

05:52.270 --> 05:56.550
But first of all, you should understand what does the lowest I mean.

05:57.340 --> 06:01.020
For example, for example, let me make a very, very simple graph.

06:01.030 --> 06:01.930
Very simple graph.

06:02.590 --> 06:04.900
I have this let's say one, two, three.

06:06.120 --> 06:12.570
And right now, just for exploration purposes, we will consider that discovered time.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.190
Is equal to the north.

06:23.860 --> 06:25.330
Well, just what explanation purposes?

06:25.330 --> 06:27.040
So why did they discover the name of one?

06:27.040 --> 06:30.520
It is one where they discovered the time of doing this to read history and so on.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.500
Well, let's connect.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.830
This now is when I performative history.

06:35.830 --> 06:37.030
It is like this one.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.880
Two and three.

06:40.260 --> 06:41.700
And then it is a.

06:42.610 --> 06:43.410
We have a back edge.

06:45.280 --> 06:45.530
Okay.

06:46.390 --> 06:50.650
Well, what is what is what are the lowest ame of these nodes?

06:51.130 --> 06:53.080
So we know what are the risk global time of these nodes.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.010
One, two and three only.

06:54.020 --> 06:54.300
Right?

06:54.310 --> 06:56.120
So I'm not writing it officially.

06:57.070 --> 06:59.500
Now, let's figure out the lowest aim of these nodes.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.930
So what is the lowest aim of tree?

07:03.400 --> 07:04.690
What did the lowest team of three.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.480
It is a time of a known.

07:08.670 --> 07:14.040
From which I can go from this arbitrary of three by using at most one package so that there are no nodes

07:14.040 --> 07:15.060
in this ability of the tree.

07:15.090 --> 07:19.320
But yes, trees and an ordinary arbitrary of tree from tree I can go to one.

07:20.440 --> 07:20.660
Okay.

07:20.710 --> 07:27.610
So I'm using at most one package and I'm going to one and the discover time of one voice one.

07:28.090 --> 07:28.390
Right.

07:28.540 --> 07:29.050
Because.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.110
Is equal to the node name for now.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.540
Well, no number on name, whatever.

07:35.140 --> 07:37.990
What is the lowest I of three guys at this one?

07:39.560 --> 07:46.070
Because from its subtree that is including the node itself, I'm able to go to a particular node which

07:46.070 --> 07:46.970
is somewhere above.

07:48.070 --> 07:48.360
Okay.

07:48.850 --> 07:51.760
It is some variable by vibe, but where am I saying you did?

07:51.760 --> 07:52.600
Somewhere above.

07:52.660 --> 07:54.700
Because in the DFS three.

07:56.070 --> 07:59.380
If a node is discovered fast, that means it has some above level.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.510
It is some higher level.

08:00.990 --> 08:03.120
Hey, always, guys, always remember.

08:03.930 --> 08:05.520
It's not a it's not to remember.

08:05.520 --> 08:13.140
It's a fact, basically, that if you're performing a DFC, then a node will be visited first and then

08:13.140 --> 08:17.040
it's empties, then it's then the node interceptors.

08:17.640 --> 08:25.170
So if I have a node which is an ancestor of a then then that ancestor will always be always have a lesser

08:25.170 --> 08:26.040
discovered time.

08:26.550 --> 08:28.080
Let me write it just in case.

08:29.210 --> 08:30.110
An ancestor.

08:31.350 --> 08:32.490
In the history.

08:34.790 --> 08:36.470
Will always be discovered first.

08:40.560 --> 08:41.850
It's very insist straight.

08:45.390 --> 08:50.700
Now, the second the second point that I wanted to tell you was the Discover team and let's say the

08:50.700 --> 08:51.270
AC.

08:51.840 --> 08:59.880
Of Ancestor, whatever the Nord is, is always, always less than the Discover team of the current Nord

08:59.970 --> 09:01.560
that we are talking about.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.500
Hey, these are some facts of the history.

09:05.720 --> 09:05.950
Well.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.880
So what is the lowest aim of three guys?

09:07.910 --> 09:08.720
One by one?

09:08.720 --> 09:12.500
Because I can I can travel through one baggage from each subtree.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.450
And this is a lead solution which I can go to.

09:14.990 --> 09:15.290
Right?

09:16.290 --> 09:18.600
So what is the discovered time off to raise?

09:19.520 --> 09:20.150
Makeover time.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.580
So what are the notes in the subtree of two?

09:22.610 --> 09:23.540
What is the subtree of two?

09:23.540 --> 09:25.660
It is two entity eight.

09:25.910 --> 09:28.100
So from two or three, we can.

09:29.530 --> 09:32.320
Go to which node which has the lowest time, we can go to one.

09:33.130 --> 09:39.670
By using one package, it is basically you are going down and then you want to go up.

09:39.940 --> 09:42.070
You want to know that how much above?

09:42.100 --> 09:48.340
How much lowest time I can get my reversing at most one package if I have some baggage.

09:48.730 --> 09:50.350
And how noisy pointing of a.

09:51.180 --> 09:52.650
In from the secretary of my.

09:53.540 --> 09:53.870
Right.

09:54.650 --> 10:01.550
So from two and three the, the subtree of two entry from the subtree of two, we have this edge that

10:01.550 --> 10:02.810
is this back.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.490
It was just pointing to one.

10:04.790 --> 10:05.060
Right.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.520
And that earned the discovered time of one is one.

10:08.180 --> 10:10.670
So the lowest time of two will also be one.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.200
World's biggest reason there's a playoff to rain.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.010
Now let's talk about one.

10:16.030 --> 10:16.480
What is it?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.370
What is the discovered time of when it is run?

10:18.370 --> 10:19.750
And what was the lowest time of one?

10:19.750 --> 10:28.240
It will be one I because from the few, if there is no back edge in this up to let's say if it was this

10:28.820 --> 10:34.300
fracture then discover time of three was three and the lowest time of three was also three.

10:34.870 --> 10:42.190
Hey, because as I said, as it is all already written that it is by using at most one package, at

10:42.190 --> 10:45.350
most one, we can not even use a package right.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.200
By using at most one package.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.740
How much above I am able to go.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.620
So here we can see we don't have a package.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.430
That means if I am on two, then they discover time is true.

10:54.430 --> 10:56.620
So the lowest time is to take one.

10:56.620 --> 10:56.860
But.

10:57.220 --> 11:00.160
But if I get some packages, I have to figure it out.

11:00.310 --> 11:05.260
I have to find out that what is the lowest and for all the nodes, what is the lowest end of one, one,

11:05.260 --> 11:06.280
two, one and three?

11:06.280 --> 11:10.090
When in this case, the general, general example, very small one.

11:10.510 --> 11:15.550
Let's let's make some big examples and then we'll come back to this left figure.

11:15.670 --> 11:16.000
Right.

11:16.980 --> 11:22.200
Let's have some different examples because I really want you to understand this topic.

11:22.590 --> 11:23.160
Very nice.

11:24.820 --> 11:26.060
So, buddy.

11:31.800 --> 11:35.460
But let's make a normal, simple graph that we generally take.

11:35.490 --> 11:37.440
So one, two, three, four.

11:38.620 --> 11:39.850
Five six.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.840
Seven well before an order to their discovery.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.070
Time is equal to the known number.

11:45.370 --> 11:47.500
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

11:48.430 --> 11:50.770
Well, guys, let's perform.

11:50.950 --> 11:53.600
Let's write the lowest rates of one.

11:54.280 --> 11:54.940
I go to.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.120
I go to three?

11:58.260 --> 12:00.060
Then I come back to do I go to Fort?

12:01.940 --> 12:02.870
I go to five?

12:04.570 --> 12:06.730
426427.

12:07.680 --> 12:12.780
And I have some packages that are package from 3 to 1, maximum 7 to 4.

12:14.430 --> 12:14.720
Right.

12:15.150 --> 12:18.060
And let me right there discover things.

12:18.100 --> 12:24.540
So one, two, three, four, five, six and seven, so that we don't get confused them because this

12:24.540 --> 12:26.070
is a sorry to hear.

12:27.570 --> 12:27.870
Yeah.

12:28.440 --> 12:34.680
Now, guys, let's start from deep here, down seven, eight, because as we have already seen, that

12:34.680 --> 12:39.040
the lowest aim of anybody, gun Nord, will be equal to bust.

12:39.900 --> 12:40.190
Yeah.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.720
So we can form articles in relation to talk about it later.

12:42.990 --> 12:47.340
But for now, let's just understand what will be the lowest time in this this particular example.

12:47.340 --> 12:52.290
So I would strongly suggest you to pause the video and try to figure it out the lowest time yourself

12:52.290 --> 12:52.620
first.

12:52.770 --> 12:55.350
Then of course I'd be doing it and then you can match it.

12:56.510 --> 12:56.790
Okay.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.370
So we'll start from the downwards by cool.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.140
So we are at seven right now.

13:01.500 --> 13:06.330
What is the lowest time from seven there that can go by traversing at most one package.

13:08.120 --> 13:08.690
From seven.

13:08.690 --> 13:09.410
I can go to four.

13:09.410 --> 13:09.830
Right.

13:11.070 --> 13:12.570
What should be the lowest aim.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.620
From seven that I can go to rate.

13:17.190 --> 13:19.230
What is the lowest time for seven?

13:19.230 --> 13:27.780
It is for by because I'm the subtree of seven by traversing at most one because I am able to go to four,

13:27.990 --> 13:31.620
which is the minimum value which has the minimum discovered time.

13:31.860 --> 13:36.450
Well, it means how much above I am able to go to basically go from six guys.

13:36.720 --> 13:42.190
If I talk about subtree of six and how much about book and I go if I go in the secretary of State Center

13:42.210 --> 13:44.550
was at most one because I can go to four.

13:45.510 --> 13:45.840
Eight.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.540
But some of you might be thinking that from seven I can go to four.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.130
But from what?

13:50.130 --> 13:50.940
I can go to two.

13:50.940 --> 13:54.140
And from two, I can go to one and 218.

13:54.150 --> 13:54.310
So.

13:54.690 --> 13:57.360
But that's not what we are trying to discuss here.

13:58.260 --> 14:01.350
We are just saying that I just have to traverse at most fun decades.

14:01.350 --> 14:06.600
And when I have to traverse that because I'll stop there, I won't be able I'm not traveling above that

14:07.140 --> 14:07.890
or after that.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.720
I just run baggage and nothing else.

14:10.140 --> 14:13.350
Well, from six guys, let's talk about six.

14:13.740 --> 14:14.860
What is the minimum time?

14:14.880 --> 14:17.250
What is the lowest time from six that I can go to?

14:17.700 --> 14:18.150
It is.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.290
But again, it because the lowest time from seven was four.

14:24.590 --> 14:26.510
Now, what are the lowest down from five?

14:26.660 --> 14:30.650
Again, it is four because from five or six I can go to seven.

14:30.650 --> 14:31.940
And then there was one back.

14:31.940 --> 14:33.650
I didn't go to four from four guys.

14:34.100 --> 14:39.310
It will be for only five because you only want to reverse this package, which is from 7 to 4.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.040
I'll come to four.

14:40.040 --> 14:40.580
Only eight.

14:41.870 --> 14:44.380
So the lowest time is for comfort.

14:44.420 --> 14:45.960
Now, let's talk about three.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.420
The lowest aim of today's one.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.950
Lowest aim of two is one.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.930
And for the lowest aim of one is one.

14:52.350 --> 14:52.830
Right, guys.

14:53.460 --> 14:54.300
Because see?

14:55.180 --> 14:55.660
From two.

14:55.660 --> 14:58.890
I can go to four or five, then six and seven intervals.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.040
One back to four.

15:00.610 --> 15:00.910
Right.

15:01.510 --> 15:07.780
But as I said, out of all the packages available, I have to find the minimum one, the one which is

15:07.780 --> 15:09.520
giving the minimum lowest time to me.

15:10.150 --> 15:10.360
Okay.

15:10.420 --> 15:15.880
So there is this package from in the subtree of two that is like two, then go to three, then go to

15:15.880 --> 15:16.150
one.

15:16.810 --> 15:20.800
And then there is a second package which is like 2 to 4 to 5 to 6.

15:21.870 --> 15:27.950
Seven and then it will go back to four eight, which is giving me the minimum discovered tangos.

15:27.950 --> 15:32.910
This Escobar time of one is one discover time of four is for a minimum is one.

15:34.220 --> 15:36.200
I hope this part is clear.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.180
Let me make some more examples.

15:38.240 --> 15:38.470
Hey.

15:39.440 --> 15:42.680
That can be like doubts of some students who.

15:44.060 --> 15:46.460
Well, I have this and other examples.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.360
It's like it's a very simple example, like.

15:50.690 --> 15:51.170
Again.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.340
One who.

15:53.520 --> 15:53.880
The.

15:55.870 --> 15:57.640
It's like a chain initially.

16:00.120 --> 16:00.660
Five.

16:02.010 --> 16:03.870
And it's a mix.

16:04.170 --> 16:10.950
And then what we have is we have some edges like five and then edge four, four, edge four, three.

16:11.490 --> 16:13.320
Edge 42841.

16:14.200 --> 16:14.490
Eight.

16:15.470 --> 16:16.730
So here.

16:17.870 --> 16:19.160
Here we have one.

16:20.730 --> 16:27.150
Two, three, four, five time right now making the BFC, I go to six.

16:27.450 --> 16:29.370
Then from six guys I'll have packages.

16:29.370 --> 16:32.970
The first package is finding two five akin packages finding the fourth.

16:33.150 --> 16:37.020
Third one is finding the three for 2022 two and.

16:37.940 --> 16:40.670
Last one is finding 218.

16:41.230 --> 16:41.470
Okay.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.000
In me.

16:45.220 --> 16:45.640
Or.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.560
Or what we can do is.

16:48.010 --> 16:49.250
Okay, no problem.

16:49.270 --> 16:51.190
Let's try to understand from this.

16:51.190 --> 16:52.940
Figured only anything else.

16:53.590 --> 16:55.030
What is the lowest time of six?

16:56.260 --> 16:58.240
From six, he brought driver some baggage.

16:58.270 --> 16:59.990
Then, of course, there are so many baggage.

17:00.100 --> 17:00.370
Right?

17:00.400 --> 17:01.990
So discover time is equal to.

17:03.650 --> 17:08.660
Nord number four now so that we don't get confused or discover things are very clear.

17:08.870 --> 17:12.770
One, two, three, four, five, seven, six, eight.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.180
Now it's from six six.

17:14.180 --> 17:19.580
If I start, then what is the lowest discover time I can go to better everything at most one package.

17:20.930 --> 17:22.370
Think about it, I can go to five.

17:22.640 --> 17:23.780
My time is in one package.

17:23.780 --> 17:24.740
Go to forgo the three.

17:24.740 --> 17:25.670
Go to to go to one.

17:26.890 --> 17:31.420
Out of all the notes that I can go to, which has the minimum lowest time, which is I'm sorry, which

17:31.420 --> 17:35.650
has the minimum discovered time right now I'm not talking about the lowest payment, but the notes.

17:35.650 --> 17:37.960
I'm talking about the discovered time of the other note.

17:38.350 --> 17:38.650
Right?

17:39.010 --> 17:42.460
Which Nord has the minimum discovered?

17:42.460 --> 17:43.660
Time was one.

17:44.140 --> 17:47.370
We can easily see that one has the minimum discovered time of one rate.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.120
So what is the lowest time of six days?

17:49.120 --> 17:49.660
It is one.

17:51.250 --> 17:51.580
Hey.

17:51.580 --> 17:55.360
So I hope you are getting this part now that if I have many packages from some subtree.

17:56.830 --> 18:01.810
There are lots of packages from which from which I can go, but I have to take the one which has the

18:01.810 --> 18:02.350
minimum.

18:03.180 --> 18:03.990
Discover time.

18:04.230 --> 18:08.700
Well, again, for five it would be one four, four, one, three, one, two, one and four one.

18:08.700 --> 18:09.540
Also it will be one.

18:10.050 --> 18:14.970
But all the notes, Louis, time will be one eight because I can try with this package and go to one.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.830
So I hope they discover time.

18:18.830 --> 18:22.280
And the lowest time for this example is also clear.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.140
It's a normal example of this.

18:24.950 --> 18:25.190
Well.

18:26.490 --> 18:26.850
Great.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.980
Or should I make more examples?

18:29.490 --> 18:31.040
Let's frame one more example.

18:31.050 --> 18:31.290
Right.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.250
Let's make it a general example.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.240
Right now, I'm just making some random.

18:47.110 --> 18:47.740
Example.

18:51.780 --> 18:52.670
It's going to these.

18:52.690 --> 18:53.770
It's going to these.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.910
Is there anything else to connect the dots?

18:56.910 --> 18:58.580
Connect these.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.280
Well, random example now it very easy, guys.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.280
Let's start.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.530
Let's performer do history.

19:05.040 --> 19:05.850
Starting from one.

19:06.350 --> 19:07.950
Well, I can start from any node.

19:07.950 --> 19:08.910
It won't matter.

19:09.300 --> 19:09.780
Any node.

19:09.810 --> 19:11.400
Train, start from one.

19:11.910 --> 19:13.440
So the discovered time of one is one.

19:13.440 --> 19:17.490
Let's say I went to discover time is two, it's over.

19:17.490 --> 19:21.270
And before Discover time is three, I went to seven.

19:22.520 --> 19:28.670
Discover time is for I went to it discovered time is by now this I cannot go down.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.380
I cannot go below a train.

19:30.410 --> 19:34.610
I cannot go somewhere below it because there is no particular edge.

19:34.850 --> 19:37.040
I come back to back from seven.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.050
Then I can go to my nature.

19:39.050 --> 19:45.800
Let's me again you which which is finding to five and discover time is six, eight, six note to be

19:45.800 --> 19:47.750
discovered then from five.

19:48.970 --> 19:49.750
Oh, cool.

19:49.810 --> 19:53.710
So I think I made a bigger figure it might not fit into.

19:54.910 --> 19:55.420
This.

19:56.700 --> 19:57.210
Actually.

19:58.170 --> 19:58.920
Let me read that.

20:01.430 --> 20:02.660
But making a small figure.

20:02.660 --> 20:02.930
Right.

20:02.990 --> 20:05.690
So let's make a small figure one.

20:06.660 --> 20:07.050
To.

20:08.260 --> 20:09.490
And then we went to Ford.

20:10.830 --> 20:12.690
Then we went to seven.

20:12.720 --> 20:13.610
We went to eight.

20:14.400 --> 20:18.480
So it is discover times are one, two, three, four, five.

20:19.080 --> 20:23.010
From eight I come back to seven, I go to fight and forming a DFC.

20:23.010 --> 20:25.170
Here it is a six note to be visited.

20:25.620 --> 20:34.720
Then this when I from seven I go to five right now from five I can go to fort great.

20:34.830 --> 20:40.890
But this will be a package because four is already visited the from file I help I have a bit gets to

20:40.890 --> 20:41.190
four.

20:42.090 --> 20:43.340
And four from five.

20:43.340 --> 20:44.400
I have a big issue to.

20:46.810 --> 20:51.570
So I've just made both the packages now from five, I can go to six.

20:52.740 --> 20:54.570
It is the seventh node to be discovered.

20:54.960 --> 20:59.130
Then from six I can go to three the eighth nor to be discovered.

20:59.730 --> 21:00.060
Right.

21:00.090 --> 21:03.330
And then from three, I cannot go to one because it's a package.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.630
So let me, like, make this as a package.

21:07.510 --> 21:07.790
Great.

21:08.560 --> 21:08.830
Well.

21:10.070 --> 21:13.190
So from three I went to one, which was a package.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.680
And, uh, how many notes Ami notes I have, I have to relate notes.

21:19.460 --> 21:25.400
And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven are the edges 1 to 3 packages.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.660
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eight.

21:29.000 --> 21:29.810
So fine.

21:29.930 --> 21:31.460
We have three packages in this case.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.720
Now let's find the lowest time.

21:33.290 --> 21:36.080
As I said, guys, I'll be using a little bit of dynamic programming.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.280
Whose records in relation?

21:37.280 --> 21:39.040
I'll be telling you in a while.

21:39.170 --> 21:43.430
For now, I just want to clear out what is the lowest value for every note.

21:43.430 --> 21:46.310
For any note, we'll start from down.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.190
There's hardly any programming bugs that that.

21:51.330 --> 21:55.700
So if I were to get a grid, some function, I need to calculate the values of some of the functions.

21:56.140 --> 21:56.390
Eight.

21:57.610 --> 21:58.420
Just give me a second.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.140
Well, I'm back and.

22:01.380 --> 22:02.400
Yeah, so we were here.

22:02.880 --> 22:03.840
Let's find the lowest time.

22:03.840 --> 22:09.660
Put all the notes before the node number three, which was we discovered that time equates to eight.

22:09.840 --> 22:14.580
What is the lowest discovery time, which I can go to by traveling to the package?

22:15.090 --> 22:16.230
It is one.

22:17.840 --> 22:19.530
Eight from six.

22:19.950 --> 22:24.800
Ordered subtree I can go to again one because I can go to three and then to over the back as to one

22:25.520 --> 22:26.210
from five.

22:28.000 --> 22:28.570
I can.

22:29.540 --> 22:34.190
Go to do my traveling, do everything, this package, but I can also go to one.

22:36.020 --> 22:37.400
So the minimum is one.

22:38.030 --> 22:39.290
Now, let's talk about.

22:39.290 --> 22:41.600
So let's talk about seven or.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.160
Before that, let's talk about it.

22:43.610 --> 22:49.670
So whenever I want to figure out some Louis name for some particular note, I'll figure out the lowest

22:49.670 --> 22:50.210
I for it.

22:50.210 --> 22:50.930
Subtree first.

22:51.260 --> 22:51.500
Well.

22:52.700 --> 22:53.690
But what about eight guys?

22:53.810 --> 22:57.710
Novak, Hedges, Louis time is equal to their discovered time or seven.

22:57.740 --> 23:02.870
It will be one, four, four, one, four, two, one and four one.

23:02.870 --> 23:03.470
It will be one.

23:04.830 --> 23:05.340
It goes.

23:06.370 --> 23:10.480
So I hope the lowest time is clear for this example also.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.170
But now just let's let's have a normal discussion.

23:15.670 --> 23:16.450
What is the lowest?

23:16.450 --> 23:18.250
I mean, that if.

23:20.360 --> 23:24.140
It's a general not giving you an example of the general visualization.

23:24.860 --> 23:27.890
So I started from some note I came down.

23:28.230 --> 23:33.950
I there was some part I was some difference up trees came down to a particular node, let's call it

23:34.550 --> 23:35.000
current.

23:36.750 --> 23:36.930
Well.

23:37.110 --> 23:40.080
So I came down to walk around the node and.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.180
I went down, I calculated the lowest time.

23:43.930 --> 23:51.010
Now I want to figure out that if I go in the subtree of Current or from current, how much?

23:52.260 --> 23:52.650
Above.

23:52.650 --> 23:53.190
Can I go?

23:55.390 --> 23:55.590
Eight.

23:57.850 --> 23:59.020
I hope you're getting this point.

23:59.410 --> 24:00.890
How much above can I go?

24:00.910 --> 24:01.420
How much?

24:02.400 --> 24:04.190
Above in this.

24:05.750 --> 24:07.050
I can go in there to fishery.

24:07.250 --> 24:07.970
What is the minimum?

24:07.970 --> 24:11.440
Lowest time I can go to you guys.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.300
What does this mean?

24:13.520 --> 24:16.310
Try to visualize or know if I'm on a current or.

24:17.270 --> 24:18.370
And cool.

24:18.830 --> 24:20.150
Let's discuss in the next video.

24:20.150 --> 24:21.710
This has already been big enough.

24:22.310 --> 24:23.170
And yeah.

24:23.390 --> 24:23.720
So.

24:24.880 --> 24:31.870
I hope you can find out, Louis time yourself by just making some graphs, performing the history and

24:31.870 --> 24:33.820
figuring out the Louis time rate.

24:34.600 --> 24:40.420
It should not be a big issue like on pen and paper and how to use it in algorithm, how to code it,

24:40.420 --> 24:41.980
how to apply the new programming to it.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.110
I'll be telling you in the next video.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.150
We'll source in the next video.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.080
Guys, thank you.
