00:00.770 --> 00:01.310
Everyone.

1
00:01.310 --> 00:06.080
So we are discussing it and the problem, it's a popular problem on record and you can see it.

2
00:06.340 --> 00:08.030
It's known as friends betting problem.

3
00:08.360 --> 00:16.370
So given friends who want to go to a party and each of them can remain single or can be paired up with

4
00:16.370 --> 00:20.840
some other friends, let's say that is a party happening and go up.

5
00:21.030 --> 00:21.260
Okay.

6
00:21.740 --> 00:25.310
Maybe you want to go to this party.

7
00:26.490 --> 00:28.210
And what people can do.

8
00:28.230 --> 00:29.640
People can either go solo.

9
00:30.950 --> 00:36.350
Or they can pair up with someone, they can go as a couple as well.

10
00:37.130 --> 00:40.730
So either you can go single or you can go as a couple.

11
00:41.420 --> 00:44.780
So each friend can be paired only once.

12
00:44.810 --> 00:45.050
Okay.

13
00:45.050 --> 00:47.780
You cannot make beds with multiple people.

14
00:47.780 --> 00:52.100
Find out the total number of ways in which friend friends can remain single or can be paired up.

15
00:52.630 --> 00:58.460
So let us take an example of a let's say we have three friends.

16
00:58.640 --> 00:58.950
Okay.

17
00:59.810 --> 01:02.570
So what we can do is A, B and C.

18
01:03.550 --> 01:05.410
Now all of them can go single.

19
01:05.410 --> 01:06.250
So there is one way.

20
01:06.370 --> 01:07.180
It goes alone.

21
01:07.180 --> 01:08.560
Because alone she goes alone.

22
01:09.100 --> 01:09.670
Or maybe.

23
01:09.790 --> 01:12.420
And we decide to pair up and she goes alone.

24
01:12.430 --> 01:13.030
Or maybe.

25
01:13.540 --> 01:14.770
And they decide to pair up.

26
01:15.040 --> 01:16.450
And we go alone again.

27
01:17.050 --> 01:17.650
Or maybe.

28
01:18.160 --> 01:22.060
And we decide to pair up and it goes alone.

29
01:22.360 --> 01:27.370
That is all too possible if you are for friends, like for an equal to three.

30
01:27.970 --> 01:28.990
The answer is four.

31
01:29.500 --> 01:33.160
If you had four friends then that would have been even more combinations.

32
01:33.760 --> 01:41.110
Even all of them can go solo, but in the best case, all of them can get paired up, maybe even be

33
01:41.110 --> 01:45.580
better and better and better be any better.

34
01:46.360 --> 01:50.930
Or maybe EG was alone because alone he ended up.

35
01:50.950 --> 01:59.110
So there are so many ways we need to find out and how many ways you can add up these people or you they

36
01:59.200 --> 02:00.220
can also go as single.

37
02:00.220 --> 02:01.330
Some of them can go as single.

38
02:01.330 --> 02:02.530
Some of them also can be.

39
02:03.310 --> 02:04.210
That is a question.

40
02:04.870 --> 02:09.010
Now, let us discuss possible approach to solve this kind of a problem.

41
02:10.070 --> 02:12.140
So again, idea is we try to break it down.

42
02:12.610 --> 02:20.150
We have people who are standing in the road, let's say, and there is this guy, let's say, and now

43
02:20.630 --> 02:23.050
we will only talk about what are the options for.

44
02:23.360 --> 02:23.630
Okay.

45
02:23.630 --> 02:27.830
Let's say it has B, C, D, up to up to whatever it is.

46
02:27.830 --> 02:29.060
If you have up to ten people.

47
02:30.820 --> 02:34.330
Now, if it goes alone, there is one option.

48
02:34.330 --> 02:36.940
If it goes alone, then what is going to happen?

49
02:37.570 --> 02:38.440
The remaining people.

50
02:39.100 --> 02:41.160
Okay, so you can go alone in only one way.

51
02:41.200 --> 02:42.880
There is only one way for it to go.

52
02:43.240 --> 02:43.840
I look able.

53
02:43.880 --> 02:45.000
Look, I'm going to the party.

54
02:45.420 --> 02:47.050
The rest of you manage by yourself.

55
02:47.500 --> 02:51.250
If there are f of envies for all of these people to go to the party.

56
02:51.640 --> 02:52.930
But n minus one people.

57
02:53.230 --> 02:57.100
There is harmony of is f of n minus one is is also going.

58
02:57.100 --> 02:58.450
And these people are all doing so.

59
02:58.790 --> 03:01.570
And these people are going, who is going alone?

60
03:01.700 --> 03:03.780
There is only one way in which he can go alone.

61
03:03.850 --> 03:11.350
It would be one multiplied by F of n minus one because there is a is going and n minus one people are

62
03:11.350 --> 03:11.950
all going.

63
03:12.670 --> 03:17.920
Or what we can have is is no, I want to go with my girlfriend.

64
03:17.950 --> 03:18.210
Okay.

65
03:18.220 --> 03:22.960
So he wants to be Arab, so he wants to make up here with someone.

66
03:22.970 --> 03:24.550
Okay, so that would be anyone.

67
03:24.760 --> 03:26.980
Maybe that could be this girl.

68
03:27.790 --> 03:29.590
Or maybe that could be this guy.

69
03:30.960 --> 03:33.960
It won't work and it might be out of the this one or this one.

70
03:34.500 --> 03:37.200
So it has how many options to make up here?

71
03:37.590 --> 03:44.590
Obviously, we have N minus one B, but we have it has MN minus one basis.

72
03:45.150 --> 03:51.900
Lapera But someone says, okay, we'll build up at some one in minus one with how many people are left

73
03:51.900 --> 03:55.380
in the remaining three you're left with and minus two people.

74
03:56.220 --> 04:02.790
So it can go with someone and minus one, even with that is nothing but n minus one in two.

75
04:03.810 --> 04:09.310
And the remaining people are also going so they can go in how many base that is F of n minus two.

76
04:10.350 --> 04:16.590
Look, we would find London would be some of these took all the means plus the one into a five and minus

77
04:16.590 --> 04:18.870
one plus and minus one into f of n minus.

78
04:19.290 --> 04:22.620
We can write f of and as f of an would be nothing but.

79
04:25.770 --> 04:28.470
F of n minus one if it goes alone.

80
04:28.650 --> 04:32.580
Plus and minus one in two and minus two.

81
04:34.030 --> 04:37.300
That is that Oakland will get the ideas that it grants that we have created.

82
04:37.690 --> 04:39.310
Now, what about the base case?

83
04:40.990 --> 04:48.180
If there are zero people in the whole country, if there is one person, that would be one.

84
04:48.970 --> 04:54.610
If there are two people, then either they go alone, let's say N.B., or they go as a couple.

85
04:54.640 --> 05:01.210
There are two ways they try to drive this using this reference so we can see f four then equal to two

86
05:01.210 --> 05:01.810
should be two.

87
05:02.710 --> 05:09.790
We can also verify and minus one is what one plus two minus one is one and f of two minus two that is

88
05:09.790 --> 05:10.150
zero.

89
05:10.180 --> 05:11.170
So that is also one.

90
05:11.170 --> 05:13.510
So it is nothing but two of those two.

91
05:13.510 --> 05:18.340
What about an equal to three and equal to trivial F of three minus one?

92
05:18.340 --> 05:19.510
That is F of two.

93
05:20.080 --> 05:23.920
That is nothing but two plus and minus one.

94
05:23.920 --> 05:28.240
That is what three minus one two into f of n minus two, three minus two.

95
05:28.240 --> 05:30.420
That is a4141 is almost one.

96
05:30.890 --> 05:31.840
Two plus two is four.

97
05:32.380 --> 05:35.770
We just saw that for an equal to three, Don, that is coming forward.

98
05:35.780 --> 05:41.240
And that is also true because we discussed it, because we can go alone, we can go together.

99
05:41.310 --> 05:43.750
We can go alone, we can go together.

100
05:43.750 --> 05:46.510
You can go alone or you can go together.

101
05:46.540 --> 05:47.410
We can go alone.

102
05:47.960 --> 05:54.910
So these are the four ways that means that occurrence that we have derived is correct and it will work

103
05:54.910 --> 05:56.200
for all values of n.

104
05:56.230 --> 05:56.500
Okay.

105
05:57.490 --> 06:03.430
So again, the time complexity is going to be exponential, but it can be reduced to linear very easily

106
06:03.880 --> 06:07.540
using memorization if you know a little bit about dynamic programming.

107
06:07.540 --> 06:07.990
All right.

108
06:08.410 --> 06:10.450
So that's all for this video.

109
06:10.450 --> 06:10.930
Thank you.
