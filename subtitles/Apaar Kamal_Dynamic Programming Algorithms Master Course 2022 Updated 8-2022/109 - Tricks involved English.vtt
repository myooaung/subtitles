00:00.660 --> 00:03.300
A couple of things regarding this problem.

00:03.320 --> 00:07.640
So if you have tried it by submitting it on this page.

00:08.640 --> 00:12.990
Well, you might have realized that these are some 2 minutes to this.

00:13.290 --> 00:21.900
10 minutes going to ten into to into case to case to my right, which is is Google still introduced

00:21.900 --> 00:29.790
about four inch power forward into this into ten into two is going to change nine right and we cannot

00:30.420 --> 00:32.340
not have this must be is in accord.

00:33.450 --> 00:33.800
Right.

00:34.380 --> 00:34.650
So.

00:35.530 --> 00:43.630
And you think of some special trick in which we can optimize our code, maybe reduce some space.

00:44.530 --> 00:45.850
So the problem lies here.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.550
Hey, let me show you quickly.

00:50.790 --> 00:51.030
Eight.

00:51.460 --> 00:57.480
Tell me, guys, if there's a number of nine or ten digits, it's a candidate in the worst case.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.720
What can be some of digits at max?

01:02.180 --> 01:03.060
In midnight.

01:03.170 --> 01:06.530
If all of them are nine, it can be nine into ten.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.680
I'm saying it makes it just 98.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.870
Look, there is some of the dudes, although I'm taking it more by key.

01:15.110 --> 01:17.480
But will this amount of digits ever exceed 90?

01:18.470 --> 01:18.770
No.

01:18.770 --> 01:25.910
Right, because they say the maximum is 90, it can't go above 98.

01:25.910 --> 01:32.890
If K is greater than 90, then it will always be less any golden 98.

01:33.080 --> 01:37.570
If it is less than 90, then also they will be less than equal to name because I'm taking more baking.

01:38.490 --> 01:40.240
I hope you got this point, mate.

01:40.410 --> 01:41.820
So in instead of gear here.

01:42.890 --> 01:45.770
Let's see that this state goes on a little nine D.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.270
So now what are the new stewards we have?

01:47.270 --> 01:52.760
We have ten into two into K into 98.

01:52.970 --> 01:54.710
So let me check how much it is.

01:56.590 --> 02:04.420
Eastern is about four into ten in nineties, nine into this into two which is 18 in ten is to the power.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.100
Six, which is 1.8 to 10 days to power.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.690
Seven again goes.

02:11.410 --> 02:14.620
This is approximately equal to two entertainers, two by seven.

02:15.040 --> 02:22.900
Again, we can see that this is too much and we cannot use this much because it will give me a memory

02:22.900 --> 02:26.440
limit exit rate because this space is too much.

02:27.990 --> 02:28.290
Eight.

02:29.470 --> 02:34.300
So how how can I further improvise on this and introduce this case?

02:34.300 --> 02:36.400
Well, let's just think about it.

02:37.060 --> 02:37.260
Okay.

02:37.630 --> 02:40.900
So this is nothing but some of mod.

02:41.800 --> 02:42.020
Eight.

02:42.520 --> 02:51.280
So what is some of what I'm always trying to add a number multiplied by some particular digit and divided.

02:52.810 --> 02:56.320
Just think about of course, this is very tricky.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.300
What I will be explaining you is very tricky.

02:58.300 --> 03:02.530
But I want you to just think about this and can you use this key?

03:03.460 --> 03:06.370
You need all these values of key in here.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.530
Just think about this base case that.

03:11.850 --> 03:14.610
If someone legitimate can only go till 90.

03:15.270 --> 03:19.110
And will it ever be true for some particular case?

03:21.830 --> 03:22.100
Right.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.650
So I'm I'll just quickly give you an example.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.850
Otherwise, you can simply posit it.

03:27.850 --> 03:29.650
It's this amount of digits.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.450
Some of the digits, some legitimate.

03:34.200 --> 03:38.860
And this can go only till 90 hierarchies.

03:38.880 --> 03:39.270
Right.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.360
So let's see if K is greater than equal to 90.

03:44.920 --> 03:53.860
Prior to the 98 if case greater than nine degrees in some warm digits, Maud and I would be zero if

03:53.860 --> 03:54.850
K's greater than 90.

03:56.370 --> 03:59.250
It can only be zero if the number is zero, right?

03:59.940 --> 04:01.320
If the number is zero.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.350
Then only.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.240
Some of Egypt's.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.660
And the more that we are taking, of course, can be zero.

04:12.110 --> 04:19.820
Otherwise I won't even be equal to zero because K is greater than 98, because some will lie between

04:19.820 --> 04:27.260
one and 90 somewhere and I'll dig more by k and k is greater than 95 is greater than 90.

04:27.260 --> 04:31.160
This market value will never be equal to zero eight.

04:31.490 --> 04:36.290
That means if K is greater than 90, there's more value will never be equal to zero.

04:37.560 --> 04:45.930
And if this will never be equal to zero, the villa will return one because all for this will be this

04:45.930 --> 04:46.170
one.

04:46.170 --> 04:51.480
They should also be zero rate and we know that it can never be zero if is greater than 90.

04:52.480 --> 04:57.460
800 greater than 90 is some digit mod can never be zero.

04:57.460 --> 05:01.090
And if this cannot be zero, we will never read, will never hear.

05:01.090 --> 05:07.170
This base case will even reaching ten zero zero and it will go on like endlessly rate.

05:07.180 --> 05:09.490
It will be a waste of resources.

05:09.490 --> 05:16.630
Basically it means we should not call the follow function if case is greater than 98.

05:16.930 --> 05:21.790
What I'll do here is I'll simply add one thing, which is if underscore ten is greater than.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.010
99.

05:24.030 --> 05:24.690
Simply written.

05:27.530 --> 05:30.860
I hope this makes sense by zero because.

05:31.820 --> 05:33.150
These kids will never be true.

05:33.170 --> 05:33.620
They will.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.350
It will never return when it will always return with zero.

05:36.350 --> 05:37.100
And it will return.

05:37.220 --> 05:40.130
You need to buy to call it.

05:40.340 --> 05:48.110
I mean, why do call this all function by to call it if it is giving me zero only right now the problem

05:48.110 --> 05:49.280
is reduced rate.

05:49.310 --> 05:55.460
The problem is reduced to L as an equal to 95 gazillions and equal to nine degrees.

05:55.970 --> 05:58.310
Tell me what will be the value of some mod?

06:00.210 --> 06:05.790
Just think about this because of course, for every summer we are taking it more like it will be between

06:05.790 --> 06:08.820
zero in a year, but in our case as an equal to 90.

06:09.510 --> 06:11.700
Some more will also be less than equal to.

06:12.600 --> 06:12.990
90.

06:14.480 --> 06:19.490
Not less than a little bit less than 90 because Kayla's an equal to 92, someone will be less than 90.

06:19.700 --> 06:23.690
But I hope you got this because we are digging models, Becky, late.

06:24.200 --> 06:28.480
This was a very good trick that I saw and it involved.

06:28.490 --> 06:30.360
So that's made in another video for it.

06:30.380 --> 06:31.160
I did not, you know.

06:33.570 --> 06:35.370
Try to inculcate in the body.

06:35.380 --> 06:35.730
Easier to do.

06:35.730 --> 06:38.700
Because, you know, I already solved this problem like two years ago.

06:39.090 --> 06:39.580
You can see.

06:40.110 --> 06:44.970
So I was just trying it today and I always thought that I will.

06:46.500 --> 06:54.480
I wrote this to you after the court ends, but I understood that some of digit can never exceed 90,

06:54.480 --> 06:57.840
and if discontinuing I would exceed 19 will always be between one and 90.

06:58.290 --> 06:59.910
If giggle is greater than 90.

07:01.030 --> 07:04.060
Ahmad will never be equal to zero eight.

07:05.260 --> 07:06.610
I hope so.

07:07.210 --> 07:09.040
Some legitimate will never be to you.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.350
I hope you're getting the point.

07:12.580 --> 07:16.640
But if so, if now we have the condition when gays on less than equal to 90.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.800
So some of more will always be less than equal.

07:18.800 --> 07:23.620
Look, we saw this raid and grizzlies in the nineties, so it will be less than equal to 98.

07:23.890 --> 07:25.580
Let me right now do.

07:26.880 --> 07:27.150
Well.

07:27.420 --> 07:31.860
So similarly, this is also reduced and indeed this has also reduced and indeed this has to do this

07:31.860 --> 07:33.240
is already doing the system.

07:33.270 --> 07:33.600
Right.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.760
Let me take these new values in.

07:36.360 --> 07:43.410
And two, instead of okay, we have 90 F and B and I already explain why are these 98.

07:45.790 --> 07:46.180
90.

07:47.110 --> 07:47.980
Let me be this.

07:50.290 --> 07:51.520
Hey, it's.

07:52.970 --> 07:54.920
It will obviously work.

07:55.460 --> 07:57.950
And let me see you in the next part.

07:58.430 --> 07:58.750
Thank you.
