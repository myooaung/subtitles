WEBVTT

00:00.870 --> 00:05.310
So what is the answer for the current problem, which is the verdict of a problem?

00:05.320 --> 00:06.090
Let me read this.

00:06.600 --> 00:12.600
And what we'll do is we'll try to formulate the approach and then we will write under the approach on

00:12.600 --> 00:14.520
both these three, then see the down to the same.

00:15.780 --> 00:21.600
So the first thing is, what does the current represent in my current problem, which is the vertex

00:21.600 --> 00:23.710
global problem from sponge, right?

00:24.330 --> 00:26.280
So deep current will represent nothing.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.470
But what do we need to find?

00:28.650 --> 00:28.950
Yeah.

00:28.980 --> 00:35.280
Minimum size in this tree such that each edge has at least one object and joins in the set.

00:35.460 --> 00:41.040
So what I notice I see in the picture it represents the vertex cover.

00:43.790 --> 00:44.440
Crabtree.

00:47.460 --> 00:47.760
Current.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.770
So I hope this is very clear.

00:50.230 --> 00:53.700
But if I say it, it represents the onset.

00:53.880 --> 00:54.480
Imagine it.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.130
It's the vertex cover of Subtree.

00:57.210 --> 01:00.890
And now let's move back to the problem.

01:00.900 --> 01:03.330
So in this problem, we have to do the same thing, right?

01:03.370 --> 01:05.340
We have to find a set in.

01:05.340 --> 01:10.950
That said, we have two options for every node and there that no will be in this or that node will not

01:10.950 --> 01:11.400
be in this.

01:12.090 --> 01:12.390
Right.

01:12.780 --> 01:17.250
So if we have two options for every node and we can take these two options and what we'll do is we'll

01:17.250 --> 01:24.780
try to take two APIs here, and the first DP will be DP Current Zero, which is a vertex cover.

01:26.230 --> 01:29.440
Or discover if the current node.

01:31.620 --> 01:36.660
It's not so zero four, not eight, not in the.

01:40.080 --> 01:45.000
So basically the picture in zero represents the vertex cover of this subtree of the current node.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.720
If the current node is not using it in the way.

01:49.710 --> 01:53.280
Of liquidated custody of the deputy.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.630
And what is the current one?

01:58.950 --> 02:04.700
But the current one will be nothing but vertex cover if.

02:06.530 --> 02:08.600
But continued is.

02:10.020 --> 02:10.500
Chosen.

02:12.120 --> 02:12.930
In this act.

02:14.200 --> 02:14.920
On the subject.

02:15.630 --> 02:15.990
Rachel.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.580
That should not be a problem here.

02:18.680 --> 02:18.920
I.

02:19.870 --> 02:22.660
And yeah, but these are the two things.

02:22.660 --> 02:25.660
These are the two most important things right now.

02:25.930 --> 02:27.700
I hope these states are very clear.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.920
So what will they be?

02:29.920 --> 02:33.010
Two comma zero represent the vertex cover of this tree.

02:33.010 --> 02:37.030
If two is not chosen and what will to come of underrepresented?

02:37.030 --> 02:38.950
The vertex cover of the three of two is.

02:40.380 --> 02:42.240
Chosen of the subtree eight.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.210
Similarly, four, three, six, four and seven, eight.

02:45.420 --> 02:48.060
And now let's just start.

02:48.060 --> 02:48.540
And.

02:50.720 --> 02:51.380
See I.

02:52.260 --> 02:56.600
So tell me, what is the verdict cover of this five or the six or the seven?

02:56.600 --> 02:57.560
So these are live notes.

02:58.940 --> 03:02.030
What is the verdict cover of these subtree of the lymph nodes?

03:03.170 --> 03:07.340
That means this DP alerted DP five, comma zero.

03:07.790 --> 03:10.670
Let's try to fill all of them, the P5 comma one.

03:11.690 --> 03:14.780
Let's just fill it for one little note that will be seen for all the other leave notes.

03:15.550 --> 03:21.410
But if I talk about subtree of five, then that subtree of I have has any of the vertices.

03:22.440 --> 03:22.670
No.

03:22.710 --> 03:22.980
Right.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.330
It has no witnesses.

03:25.350 --> 03:25.920
Then.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.980
If I don't choose right?

03:28.250 --> 03:32.300
If I don't use five, then the vertex cover of this five will be zero.

03:32.990 --> 03:34.340
That means I'm not integrating five.

03:34.340 --> 03:39.680
And still that three, which is just five alone, eight is satisfied.

03:39.860 --> 03:40.510
That is deep.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.480
508.

03:41.800 --> 03:48.000
What is deep five i it will be one by because I'm including five in my state if I'm including it deep.

03:48.320 --> 03:51.590
The thing is, if even if I'm including five, then also.

03:52.630 --> 03:56.920
The vertex cover is then also what we have this condition.

03:57.670 --> 04:00.250
That means all the edges should be in one of the vertices.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.450
But even then, the condition is fulfilled.

04:03.460 --> 04:09.730
But the solution would be one way, because I'm including, if I can, what we consider to be five one

04:09.730 --> 04:11.080
is 123500.

04:11.290 --> 04:12.970
I hope this is very clear for every.

04:13.090 --> 04:15.490
If not, these will be the base cases.

04:16.150 --> 04:19.030
So for deep beyond trees, what are the best guesses?

04:19.930 --> 04:21.970
These cases are nothing but relief.

04:21.970 --> 04:22.240
Not.

04:23.660 --> 04:24.170
Values.

04:25.510 --> 04:28.150
Because if not, I will not go anywhere else.

04:28.390 --> 04:32.050
I'll start from the welcome to the lymph node and folded down.

04:32.050 --> 04:34.900
So for the lymph node that will be the best cases and will return back.

04:38.430 --> 04:39.750
Let's talk about.

04:39.840 --> 04:40.170
Okay.

04:40.470 --> 04:45.360
So for now, let me just quickly write that I'm just looking deep five zero here and to be five one

04:45.360 --> 04:46.440
is the same for six.

04:46.450 --> 04:46.950
Simple.

04:48.270 --> 04:48.570
Yeah.

04:48.960 --> 04:53.760
Right now let's talk about how to form the record installation that we have in History City.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.480
Let's talk about Deep Current.

04:56.910 --> 04:59.520
You know if I'm not including.

05:00.710 --> 05:01.220
Let's see.

05:01.460 --> 05:02.510
Let's talk about this.

05:03.380 --> 05:09.650
So if I'm not including this too, in my vertex cover set right then.

05:10.620 --> 05:10.820
Just.

05:10.830 --> 05:11.970
Just think of it, okay?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.760
Let me not make a specific example.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.050
Let me make a big example.

05:16.140 --> 05:17.160
That would be more.

05:18.590 --> 05:19.070
Beautiful.

05:19.920 --> 05:20.220
So.

05:22.840 --> 05:23.560
Let's see.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.430
I have this tree.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.640
So this is some random tree.

05:28.060 --> 05:30.520
And right now, I'm talking about the whole.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.270
Subtree of this nature.

05:33.270 --> 05:37.620
Basically, let's add this is the current node, this is x, this is also x.

05:37.620 --> 05:40.950
So Exxon nothing but child of current eight would be.

05:41.430 --> 05:47.070
Yeah, but what would really be current zero if I'm not including the current node in my vertex covered

05:47.070 --> 05:48.030
for this whole tree.

05:49.030 --> 05:52.300
Just imagine what will happen to these edges.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.580
If I'm not including it.

05:55.420 --> 06:01.030
If I'm not including Corinne, that means I have to include X because I have to think about these two

06:01.030 --> 06:01.300
edges.

06:01.300 --> 06:01.600
Right?

06:01.960 --> 06:07.000
The edges between deep current X and the edges between current then x.

06:07.810 --> 06:11.290
If I'm not including current in the message, that's what typical environment means.

06:11.350 --> 06:14.200
That means I have to include X.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.580
That means it's safe because these are the edges should not be left out.

06:19.060 --> 06:24.340
But if these edges do not want to be left out, that means the current zero will be nothing.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.080
But it will be it.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.990
Tell me, what's the vertical part of your searches?

06:31.080 --> 06:33.720
I will do this for all the children for x.

06:34.640 --> 06:39.680
Excessive linear identity, the current as the coroner and executive and it's easy to iterate.

06:40.730 --> 06:41.000
But.

06:42.590 --> 06:44.750
What I would say is that to me, what's the.

06:45.740 --> 06:51.200
Value of your what's the vertex cover of your basically what about your subtree edges?

06:51.620 --> 06:51.890
Right.

06:52.070 --> 06:53.740
So how will he handle it?

06:53.750 --> 06:55.640
He will handle it by using the only.

06:55.880 --> 06:56.770
So I just ask it.

06:56.780 --> 07:01.250
Tell me, what's the vortex cover of your subtree if you are included.

07:01.520 --> 07:01.790
Right.

07:02.090 --> 07:03.140
Well, what is that?

07:03.200 --> 07:04.970
That is nothing but summation of.

07:06.090 --> 07:08.160
DP ex Goma one.

07:09.760 --> 07:16.990
But this deep commitment will tell me what is the vertex cover of this subtree of x which are the children

07:16.990 --> 07:18.400
of x?

07:18.400 --> 07:18.820
It's nothing.

07:18.820 --> 07:21.250
We're just going to confuse nothing.

07:21.250 --> 07:29.950
We're tired of getting eight so I just did here only it x scale of current node.

07:31.450 --> 07:36.790
But this will be difficult indeed because we have to think about the edges that are joining current

07:36.790 --> 07:37.890
in x eight.

07:38.170 --> 07:40.270
Now let's talk about what is deep current one.

07:41.080 --> 07:49.780
Will it be current one or does deep current one means that I'm including the current node into my subject?

07:50.590 --> 07:56.440
If I'm including my current node in my discover, that means these edges are satisfied.

07:56.860 --> 07:57.940
This is satisfied.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.080
This is all satisfied.

07:59.470 --> 08:01.510
But what about other edges?

08:02.050 --> 08:05.630
But as we all know in deep, we never think about other edges, right?

08:05.650 --> 08:07.510
We just think about one step deeper.

08:07.810 --> 08:11.740
And that and in that step will again think about one step deeper.

08:11.890 --> 08:12.100
Right?

08:12.250 --> 08:16.150
So we don't have to worry about the edges which are in this subtree of its state.

08:16.450 --> 08:19.300
We don't have to worry about the current edges.

08:19.300 --> 08:23.130
Current edges that are joining the current already in.

08:23.210 --> 08:23.620
Right.

08:24.190 --> 08:30.020
If what is deep cut in one means I'm including the cardinal in my vertex go if I'm including my current

08:30.020 --> 08:31.570
only member discovered this is done.

08:31.570 --> 08:32.200
This is done.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.320
That means no x not tell me.

08:36.370 --> 08:37.270
From your subtree.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.840
If I don't include you, what's the answer?

08:39.850 --> 08:42.460
And even if I include you, what's the best answer?

08:43.210 --> 08:44.290
Why am I seeing you anyway?

08:44.290 --> 08:44.740
Include you?

08:44.740 --> 08:45.220
Because.

08:46.150 --> 08:52.450
The If I'm including current I if I'm including it, that doesn't mean I will not include x.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.010
I can include x, maybe including x will give me the best answer.

08:57.010 --> 09:04.270
As you can see in this case, if I take X, if I take this particular X, then then only it will give

09:04.270 --> 09:04.970
me a good answer.

09:04.970 --> 09:05.230
Right?

09:06.170 --> 09:06.500
Why?

09:06.500 --> 09:15.110
Because it is governing for edges, but including current doesn't mean don't include x but not including

09:15.110 --> 09:15.530
current.

09:15.680 --> 09:20.990
That means this case, the first one, not including current, meant that you have to include X because

09:20.990 --> 09:21.980
of the current that.

09:22.790 --> 09:24.680
I don't hear what it says.

09:24.890 --> 09:25.850
I simply say that.

09:25.850 --> 09:26.390
Tell me.

09:28.980 --> 09:33.710
Or for it, because all this after is an independent rate for all it's in.

09:33.710 --> 09:41.010
And I will say, tell me what is the vertex cover if I include you and if I don't include you, which

09:41.010 --> 09:48.000
will be nothing but minimum of the px0 because see, if I if I included, then these are some vertex

09:48.000 --> 09:48.120
go.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.780
But and if I don't including included, these are different vertex cover.

09:52.260 --> 09:56.730
But from both of them what I want is I want minimum of them to be to write.

09:57.210 --> 09:58.590
What else is the p x.

10:01.580 --> 10:02.060
That means.

10:03.240 --> 10:04.440
Included are don't include this.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.130
Give me the minimum.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.090
I just give me the best answer for your whole subject.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.650
And what will be the final answer for the whole thing?

10:10.920 --> 10:13.200
It will be nothing but a minimum of.

10:14.110 --> 10:14.590
BP.

10:15.700 --> 10:16.930
Parent zero.

10:17.380 --> 10:18.250
Walmart, BP.

10:19.230 --> 10:25.050
Current one added include the note or you don't include the current note because it's not necessary

10:25.050 --> 10:26.070
to include the current note.

10:26.070 --> 10:28.650
Eight Into the verdict cover for the root note.

10:29.600 --> 10:34.700
Instead of going to the trade route, this will be the final answer off Main Street.

10:35.210 --> 10:36.980
But tell me if I include the route?

10:36.980 --> 10:37.370
Not all.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.250
I don't include the road.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.860
Not what the best answer for the over it.

10:41.220 --> 10:46.490
But I hope you understood both these are because the current relations might be tricky initially to

10:46.490 --> 10:52.670
understand, but after solving so many problems above, it should not be an act of now or the beginning

10:52.670 --> 10:54.570
doing nothing but submission of the biggest one.

10:54.590 --> 10:56.630
I mean, I have to include all the other children.

10:56.870 --> 10:59.330
If you've got anyone in a room with submission of minimum of.

11:01.480 --> 11:05.890
Editing through the currently ordered included, then moved to the next saying because all those subtitles

11:05.890 --> 11:08.140
are independent rate too for all those up trees.

11:09.070 --> 11:13.810
For all the subtleties of its children, I have to actually ask for their answers and take the some.

11:15.510 --> 11:18.780
So let's try to formulate it.

11:19.170 --> 11:19.380
Okay.

11:19.380 --> 11:21.240
Let's try to make the answer over here then.

11:21.900 --> 11:22.440
So this is.

11:23.580 --> 11:23.820
Yeah.

11:24.390 --> 11:25.310
Now for two.

11:25.650 --> 11:28.590
If I don't include two, that means this value.

11:29.340 --> 11:34.370
If I don't include two, what I have is I want some of it all children when they're included.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.090
So it is one eight.

11:36.870 --> 11:42.000
And as you can see, if I just talk about this object, if I don't include two, then I have to include

11:42.000 --> 11:42.270
five.

11:42.420 --> 11:45.550
Then only this 2 to 5 subtree will be satisfied.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.760
This will be illustrated.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.910
Now let's talk about.

11:51.880 --> 11:52.180
Hugo.

11:52.180 --> 11:52.600
Marvin.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.790
That means if I'm including.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.650
So if I'm including, I don't have to include you.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.210
It's not necessary to include fire.

11:58.540 --> 12:00.580
What's the best answer for the Secretary of faith?

12:00.610 --> 12:01.750
If I'm not including faith?

12:01.870 --> 12:02.500
It is zero.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.370
It is zero.

12:05.370 --> 12:10.740
And if I'm including the coroner, I do it plus one with you because I'm including the coroner aid.

12:10.980 --> 12:16.590
So I just have to make a statement that it is the minimum of all the other include or don't include

12:16.590 --> 12:19.230
part plus one because I'm including the coroner.

12:20.340 --> 12:20.570
Right.

12:20.820 --> 12:21.390
So I.

12:22.430 --> 12:28.190
I think I might have missed this plus one day, but it should be very clear doing the same one will

12:28.190 --> 12:36.050
be there because I'm including the aid and this is nothing but but good so far to the outside will be

12:36.050 --> 12:38.300
semen before also to be same, the same structure.

12:38.630 --> 12:39.800
And let's talk about this one.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.230
So what will be one comma zero?

12:42.260 --> 12:46.700
If I'm not including the one I have to include two because of this is include three because of this

12:46.700 --> 12:48.260
is include four because of this hedge.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.920
If I'm including two, three, four, what's the best answer for this after each one.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.720
But I'll just say it's three.

12:54.560 --> 12:54.890
Correct.

12:55.250 --> 12:58.490
And if I'm including one, let's say I'm including one.

12:59.740 --> 13:08.320
If I'm including one, that means one plus what editing you do or don't include to include three don't

13:08.320 --> 13:10.300
include three include four.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.020
Don't include four.

13:11.020 --> 13:11.980
What's the best answer?

13:12.370 --> 13:13.510
So from here I'll get one.

13:14.230 --> 13:17.050
From here I'll get one and from your I'll tell you, get one.

13:17.110 --> 13:18.100
So he'd been before.

13:18.900 --> 13:22.520
But if I'm including when the answer will be put.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.340
But if I don't include one, then the answer will be three.

13:25.370 --> 13:26.540
What will be my final answer?

13:26.540 --> 13:29.630
The minimum of the include or don't include.

13:29.630 --> 13:30.620
That would not of the three.

13:30.740 --> 13:31.190
Which is.

13:32.380 --> 13:34.030
I hope this is very clear.

13:34.760 --> 13:41.800
Similarly, you can try making the values for this tree one who is the root node and in the next.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.900
But I just got it and will be very easy.

13:43.900 --> 13:47.260
It will be a normal DFS if this is a first search.

13:48.100 --> 13:53.860
These small things you must know about trees, then you will be able to solve deep on trees because

13:54.130 --> 13:55.320
it's a mixture of two things.

13:55.330 --> 13:57.190
It's these plus dynamic program.

13:58.330 --> 14:05.260
So I will not be explaining terms like DFS affairs and other things as much as I explained in this and

14:05.260 --> 14:09.160
the previous video in the next part of recorded and.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.880
We'll find the answer in some Iran speech.

14:13.050 --> 14:13.440
Thank you.
