00:01.350 --> 00:01.980
Hello, everyone.

00:02.580 --> 00:03.030
Welcome.

00:03.750 --> 00:06.570
Let's solve this problem, which is literally largest sum.

00:06.870 --> 00:11.940
And believe me or not, for this particular section, that is partitioning problems.

00:12.450 --> 00:13.920
This would be the best problem.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.080
You will see it.

00:15.540 --> 00:22.320
So feel free to pause the video, solve this only first and then come back because it's a very interesting

00:22.320 --> 00:26.490
problem and it will actually test it.

00:26.520 --> 00:30.960
How much you have understood dynamic programming and some connections.

00:32.220 --> 00:38.730
So given and add in nums which consist of non-negative integers and an integer m.

00:40.260 --> 00:44.970
You can split the Addington M non M.D. contiguous summaries.

00:45.330 --> 00:50.370
Basically, the first point is that I have to split the R into not m non.

00:50.370 --> 00:51.870
I'm going to exacerbate it raised.

00:52.110 --> 00:52.410
Right.

00:52.710 --> 00:54.340
So let's say I have an area of land.

00:54.340 --> 01:00.570
Then just a quick question in how many ways I can split into m non empty.

01:01.650 --> 01:03.820
Contiguous memories.

01:04.730 --> 01:08.540
Just think about it in how many ways to do this, how many ways are possible?

01:09.220 --> 01:14.420
It's a this is a very easy combinatorics problem as well as you can solve it using dynamic programming.

01:15.080 --> 01:20.190
So basically what it means is this this algorithm called stocks algorithm.

01:20.750 --> 01:21.540
Um.

01:22.470 --> 01:27.210
Thousand bucks, maybe, let's call it technique, stars and bugs.

01:28.350 --> 01:31.920
So basically, what does it mean that let's see if I have any stars.

01:33.610 --> 01:38.800
So this will come handy a lot that I'm in stores and let me make those ties.

01:40.650 --> 01:41.490
Okay.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.740
Eight and I have some embers.

01:48.750 --> 01:48.980
I.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.420
So some of the problem is simple.

01:51.420 --> 01:55.020
I want to place em, but let's get em.

01:55.350 --> 02:01.230
So here I am is equal to one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and is seven and am is equal

02:01.230 --> 02:02.840
to, let's say three.

02:03.360 --> 02:10.740
I want to place m bars in these between these one, two, three, four, five, six, six places.

02:10.740 --> 02:12.030
I want to place three.

02:12.030 --> 02:13.090
Both eight.

02:13.680 --> 02:20.670
If I place three bars, that means I will divide this around or contiguous areas or not in going to

02:20.670 --> 02:20.760
go.

02:20.760 --> 02:21.930
So it is eight.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.230
So what are the number of ways of placing three bars?

02:26.300 --> 02:28.790
In end, minus one, there is these six.

02:29.820 --> 02:34.230
Places to do the stars and bars, and it is used in many, many places.

02:35.040 --> 02:35.520
So it is.

02:35.520 --> 02:42.270
And minus one because in many places and how many bars have to place and minus four where it is 62,

02:42.390 --> 02:45.630
which is six into five divided by.

02:46.720 --> 02:46.930
Two.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.270
It is 58.

02:49.630 --> 02:52.150
So in 15 number of years, I can.

02:54.350 --> 03:00.230
I can divide an area of land seven into border for raid or.

03:02.170 --> 03:02.600
Okay.

03:02.770 --> 03:03.450
I think.

03:03.460 --> 03:03.760
Yeah.

03:03.790 --> 03:04.570
In three.

03:05.020 --> 03:05.340
Yeah.

03:05.380 --> 03:05.680
So.

03:05.680 --> 03:06.880
So if mystery.

03:07.330 --> 03:08.350
What is the meaning of him.

03:08.710 --> 03:09.490
The number of.

03:10.710 --> 03:15.030
The number of bars and places ready to peer make me again.

03:15.150 --> 03:18.030
It really it I think I got a little confused.

03:19.690 --> 03:20.920
Oh, yeah.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.130
So right now what we have is a seven and a mystery.

03:24.400 --> 03:28.150
So let's say M is not the number of bars, but the number of.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.020
Politicians.

03:30.150 --> 03:38.070
I wanted to know if M is number of partitions then this is valid, but if M is the number of bars then

03:38.070 --> 03:40.960
it should be ns and minus one cm eight.

03:41.190 --> 03:46.020
So if I want to divide this area into three partitions, it means I have to place.

03:47.500 --> 03:51.070
Due to bias between these six places.

03:51.460 --> 03:55.660
If I place two bars anywhere, I can see we have three partitions, so don't get confused because I

03:55.660 --> 03:57.190
got confused eight.

03:57.670 --> 04:04.420
So depends on what you are considering this m as it is, bars are the z partitions right now.

04:04.420 --> 04:11.920
Let's say this partitions and and partitions two n minus one m minus one bars right now tell me in how

04:11.920 --> 04:21.210
many ways can a divide in that length seven into four going to go separate which is 78 sorry 63 it.

04:22.240 --> 04:22.490
Though.

04:22.810 --> 04:24.180
This one about stars in bars.

04:24.190 --> 04:25.190
This is okay.

04:25.210 --> 04:26.170
This isn't the problem.

04:26.530 --> 04:29.550
But I know this is not Avery, and the problem is really nice.

04:30.370 --> 04:37.720
So he says that I had an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m so berries minimize the

04:37.720 --> 04:39.670
largest sum among these.

04:39.670 --> 04:40.450
M Berries.

04:40.810 --> 04:42.880
There are multiple ways to solve this problem.

04:43.240 --> 04:47.170
One, ways to apply binary search aid.

04:47.230 --> 04:51.040
But I will not go deeper into that because I will leave it to you.

04:51.130 --> 04:52.120
You can try it yourself.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.860
There are other ways as well.

04:54.190 --> 04:55.720
But let's see.

04:55.930 --> 04:58.390
Let's approach this problem using dynamic programming.

04:59.820 --> 05:02.580
What I would do is I have to minimize the largest.

05:02.580 --> 05:05.790
Some of these are areas that I have partitions.

05:05.790 --> 05:07.260
So basically partitions.

05:07.260 --> 05:12.120
How many partitions and partitions if I have M partitions and.

05:13.810 --> 05:15.910
That means I will have some some more deliberations.

05:16.150 --> 05:20.950
What I want to do is I want to minimize the largest sum of all those partitions.

05:22.540 --> 05:22.830
So.

05:23.620 --> 05:24.490
Okay, let me.

05:27.180 --> 05:27.380
Yeah.

05:27.420 --> 05:28.740
Let me generalize things here.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.090
So let's have this.

05:30.090 --> 05:36.120
Even if this is an area and every five, six, seven, eight, eight, eight and let's.

05:36.120 --> 05:39.390
And partitioning this area into some partitions.

05:40.080 --> 05:40.350
Correct.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.560
And now what will happen?

05:44.010 --> 05:45.960
This is going to do a three of what if I basically.

05:45.960 --> 05:46.980
Seven and eight.

05:47.130 --> 05:47.430
Eight.

05:47.670 --> 05:49.290
And now let's see.

05:49.290 --> 05:49.950
These are some.

05:51.450 --> 05:54.870
Even though they do, let's call it someone colored some too.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.910
I'm just partitioning the food.

05:56.910 --> 06:00.700
So right now let's say I'm is equal to 14 and is equal to one, two, three, four, five, six, eight,

06:01.120 --> 06:01.410
eight.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.670
And this is some tree and this is some food.

06:06.180 --> 06:11.910
So out of all the partitions possible are to partition it in such a way such that the.

06:13.200 --> 06:20.040
Largest sum among these aims of it is that is max of this some one some do.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.410
Some tree and some for.

06:24.410 --> 06:26.900
Wherever is the maximum them is minimized.

06:28.970 --> 06:30.040
There should be a minimum rate.

06:30.350 --> 06:31.760
So this is one example.

06:31.830 --> 06:36.080
The second partition can be if let's say if I move it over here, then someone changes rate.

06:36.500 --> 06:43.100
So I have to figure out the minimum value of the maximum value of these partitions.

06:43.310 --> 06:46.540
That means basically it's kind of a compression rate.

06:47.300 --> 06:53.270
Just imagine that I'm compressing these sums so that the maximum sum among them is minimum.

06:54.060 --> 06:55.850
That means I can't compress further.

06:56.330 --> 07:03.260
So it's like compressing things to a minimum value so that the maximum is now at its lowest.

07:03.560 --> 07:08.480
If I remember, it cannot be removed even further because if I wait for that, then there is some other

07:08.480 --> 07:09.710
value that will come up.

07:10.370 --> 07:14.180
That's the minimum threshold under which I can.

07:15.100 --> 07:15.760
All right.

07:16.210 --> 07:17.620
So, yeah.

07:17.800 --> 07:23.490
So let's create a degree of free and deep state, which is nothing but simple, like on my arm, which

07:23.490 --> 07:26.500
stands for this array, starting from a.

07:28.710 --> 07:29.790
For Eddie.

07:30.790 --> 07:31.390
Starting.

07:33.050 --> 07:36.590
But one thing you must have noticed that what any other day big problems.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.940
What we see is what they ask.

07:38.580 --> 07:42.460
So they asked the minimum of the largest, some rain.

07:42.470 --> 07:48.140
So that's what we will make our state always made before for that is starting from.

07:49.990 --> 07:50.920
I ed to nix.

07:52.830 --> 07:53.490
Tell me.

07:55.130 --> 07:55.970
What is?

07:56.980 --> 07:58.210
Or tell me.

08:04.810 --> 08:05.650
Minimum some.

08:09.740 --> 08:10.820
The largest.

08:12.060 --> 08:14.190
Or minimum value of the largest rate.

08:14.910 --> 08:17.790
Minimum value of the largest sum.

08:18.570 --> 08:19.020
If.

08:21.530 --> 08:25.100
If I partition the area into and partitions.

08:25.430 --> 08:26.720
So if I.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.060
Partition theory.

08:33.860 --> 08:34.130
This.

08:35.490 --> 08:36.220
Thing for them.

08:36.240 --> 08:36.750
I just.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.520
Let's pause for a moment and think about it.

08:39.900 --> 08:43.500
This is simple rate for a particular iron for a particular arm.

08:43.500 --> 08:48.510
It will say that for this area, let's say I have this added gold event and so on.

08:48.960 --> 08:49.230
Right.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.550
So if I see.

08:51.850 --> 09:00.620
What is it of what is deep of two comma three that means for this area from two to n.

09:00.730 --> 09:06.060
If I partitioned it into two, if I partition into three parts, then what?

09:06.210 --> 09:11.020
What will be the minimum value of the maximum sum that is among all of them?

09:12.060 --> 09:12.320
Cool.

09:13.510 --> 09:14.650
So yeah.

09:14.860 --> 09:19.660
So now what we'll do is we'll try to partition will try to make a partition starting from eight eight.

09:19.780 --> 09:25.000
So the time when I and I'm going to make one partition of what I always sees, we're just making this

09:25.000 --> 09:27.370
partition from let's see.

09:29.260 --> 09:34.690
He is here and let's say I'm moving a jet which is making the current partition ready to do and start

09:34.690 --> 09:37.630
from my and you can go to wherever you want to go.

09:37.630 --> 09:37.960
Right.

09:38.470 --> 09:39.700
So let's do the video.

09:40.840 --> 09:46.560
So this is a partition that I'm trying to figure out the answer for that if I make this partition from

09:46.560 --> 09:50.210
this I to this day, that is this partition, right?

09:50.460 --> 09:53.760
Then how will I make my recursive relation?

09:53.760 --> 09:58.680
What, what stage will my recorded relation depend on right when making a partition.

09:58.680 --> 10:03.990
Why I do that, I can simply say, okay, for the remaining area, tell me what is the minimum value

10:03.990 --> 10:04.920
of the largest sum?

10:05.100 --> 10:09.390
If I partition the agenda m minus one partition, we are now made of another partition.

10:10.020 --> 10:17.000
So this will be nothing where deep deep j plus one because it is a partition comma m minus one.

10:17.640 --> 10:23.460
So let's just assume that deep j plus one combined minus one returns me the minimum value of the largest

10:23.460 --> 10:23.760
sum.

10:24.270 --> 10:32.280
If I partition the array starting from 4 to 6 into m minus one partition, let's introduce me that eight.

10:32.490 --> 10:38.090
So how am I going to connect it to my current recursive relation deep?

10:38.110 --> 10:39.270
AM Just think about it.

10:39.270 --> 10:42.960
I just positively because this is the most interesting part of this problem.

10:43.530 --> 10:50.250
Eight So when I tried this problem two three years ago, I actually spend maybe two 3 hours on it,

10:51.120 --> 10:51.390
but.

10:52.390 --> 10:55.870
At the time, I was just learning the new programming by directly solving problems.

10:57.190 --> 10:57.940
Just think about it.

10:58.750 --> 11:04.120
How will I make this connection between the BGA plus one and minus one and AM eight?

11:04.650 --> 11:05.050
What?

11:05.190 --> 11:06.880
What are the problems that.

11:07.980 --> 11:13.240
If I'm considering this partition, that means DP AM should be the minimum of it.

11:13.390 --> 11:16.170
It should have the minimum value of the largest sum.

11:16.770 --> 11:19.260
So now what I have is I have this sum as well.

11:20.160 --> 11:25.020
And the value of the largest sum is already coming from DPA plus one comedy minus one for the remaining

11:25.020 --> 11:25.740
88.

11:25.860 --> 11:29.640
So I will see whatever is the maximum amount, this sum.

11:30.860 --> 11:32.140
Farmer b b.

11:32.460 --> 11:34.370
B plus one comma.

11:34.370 --> 11:35.420
M minus one.

11:36.940 --> 11:37.630
I have the some.

11:38.580 --> 11:41.690
Or let's call it some I.D. instead of this summary.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.050
But it's some idea.

11:44.260 --> 11:44.920
Some idea.

11:45.010 --> 11:46.690
That is the sum of I do.

11:48.550 --> 11:48.870
I might.

11:49.720 --> 11:55.900
But whatever is the maximum value of this sum and the minimum value of the largest sum that I'm getting

11:55.900 --> 11:57.190
from the other party is generic.

11:57.580 --> 11:58.810
What is a maximum on them?

11:58.930 --> 12:03.130
What I want is I want their minimum for all the.

12:04.210 --> 12:04.420
But.

12:05.330 --> 12:14.420
I want the minimum for all the death rate as their day starts from I and they will go till lesson and

12:14.990 --> 12:21.290
it's a this is what is deep a coma and if I want to generalize it I'll just simply say that DPA Coma

12:21.290 --> 12:26.360
M is nothing, but it is the minimum value because for all the partitions that I am making, what I

12:26.360 --> 12:32.120
want is I made a partition, I've got a sun and I have the next answer, which is after the partition

12:32.120 --> 12:33.960
they dividing it into a minus one.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.170
But however it is giving me, I don't have to worry about it.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.720
I just have to worry about how can I make the current?

12:40.200 --> 12:42.270
How can I make the current debate impossible?

12:42.270 --> 12:47.430
Because in the similar fashion, the next to be de plus one and minus one will be possible that will

12:47.430 --> 12:47.850
be formed.

12:48.360 --> 12:53.310
But right now what I simply say is what all the parties and that I'm making just tell me what is the

12:53.310 --> 13:00.510
minimum value of the maximum sum rate to minimum value of the maximum sum that is.

13:01.850 --> 13:02.510
Possible.

13:03.320 --> 13:03.770
And.

13:04.960 --> 13:09.220
What is the maximum that is what is the minimal of the maximum possible for determining that it is the

13:09.220 --> 13:09.490
FBI?

13:09.490 --> 13:16.990
Plus when it is DPD plus when I am minus eight and I do this for all g do, you will start from 103

13:17.170 --> 13:18.760
and you will go ten less than it.

13:18.830 --> 13:21.820
Basically I'm just making partitions and checking that I have some.

13:22.360 --> 13:26.830
I have the other answer make the maximum and them because that's what we want rate.

13:27.160 --> 13:30.490
We want the maximum of Buddhism and I want that to be minimized.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.220
That's why we are taking minimum for all the partition.

13:34.300 --> 13:36.610
So it is slightly tricky and confusing, but.

13:37.780 --> 13:38.370
It's really good.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.540
So in the next video recorded and seen the next part.

13:42.600 --> 13:42.930
Yeah.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.230
Or what we can do is let's discuss the time complexity.

13:46.390 --> 13:46.590
Yeah.

13:46.590 --> 13:53.110
So right now we are saying we have two states, which is I go my M and for these states what I'm doing

13:53.110 --> 13:55.680
is I'm doing a work off of an it.

13:55.740 --> 14:03.450
So the complexity will be I into Aminatou and so what is I is nothing but it's with either the indexes

14:03.450 --> 14:05.520
which isn't or the complexities and squaring.

14:06.030 --> 14:06.990
But what is in here?

14:08.370 --> 14:13.750
So it extended to the power tree via Amazon.

14:14.590 --> 14:17.200
It will go back some 50 later.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.360
It established about 16 to 50.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.670
It is 500 entries for the power seven.

14:22.450 --> 14:24.700
It's a dig at the solution to this problem as well.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.430
But this is the complexity deepens giving.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.560
Then the next part, let's call it.

14:29.710 --> 14:30.210
And.
