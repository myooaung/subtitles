WEBVTT

00:01.750 --> 00:03.760
So let's move on to the next problem.

00:03.760 --> 00:05.950
And next problem is thought to.

00:06.650 --> 00:09.760
So some of you might have already gone through this problem.

00:11.970 --> 00:18.540
This says that you have been in stone same as previous when there's a frog who is initially and stone

00:18.540 --> 00:21.200
one seem to repeat them.

00:21.660 --> 00:23.460
The frog is going to Indian stone i.

00:24.350 --> 00:30.520
Jump to one of the following stone I plus one do I bliss key eight so I live.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.170
We had only these two jumps.

00:32.390 --> 00:33.260
There were only two jumps.

00:33.260 --> 00:35.720
That means they were only two transitions.

00:36.230 --> 00:37.370
It's basically a transition.

00:38.210 --> 00:39.200
We have a D, b state.

00:39.230 --> 00:41.360
We are transitioning to another d b state.

00:41.780 --> 00:42.030
Right.

00:42.470 --> 00:42.770
So.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.060
What is anime programming?

00:45.330 --> 00:49.980
Out of all the transitions we are building the best one nothing is eight view the cost.

00:50.310 --> 00:51.690
This isn't good wages.

00:51.690 --> 00:56.610
This stone to Landau right Binyamin but still in good before the frog is drawn in.

00:56.610 --> 00:58.950
So again is we can see that and it's time to go fight.

00:59.640 --> 01:00.900
Earlier we had like.

01:03.420 --> 01:05.200
And we have five kind of solution.

01:05.200 --> 01:09.510
And like Wolf in here, what we have is we have kingdoms, right?

01:09.990 --> 01:17.070
Well, before this, what we did was we considered only two jumps, that is each minus one jump, which

01:17.070 --> 01:23.370
is dances was stored in Libya in minus one made and the second was deep, i.e. minus two and only two

01:23.370 --> 01:23.610
again.

01:23.620 --> 01:27.420
So it was kind of off and into off end solution.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.090
But now we have key extra jumps, right?

01:30.120 --> 01:34.530
So instead of two jumps, we have cadence and gauge only on the right.

01:34.860 --> 01:36.030
So now what can we do is.

01:37.260 --> 01:44.490
Can we try a solution of two incredible five in 200, which is and in the case of Lucian, will this

01:44.490 --> 01:44.790
work?

01:46.130 --> 01:48.800
Yes, this year was great because execution.

01:49.460 --> 01:53.120
So it's two of version and the memory limit is enough.

01:53.690 --> 01:53.930
Eight.

01:54.050 --> 01:56.720
So ten over seven solution generally works.

01:57.810 --> 01:58.980
Eight within a second or two.

02:00.570 --> 02:00.840
Yeah.

02:00.900 --> 02:04.830
So I don't think that much explanation is needed in this fight because.

02:07.480 --> 02:08.950
It should be very, very clear.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.110
That much explanation is not new today.

02:12.980 --> 02:16.130
Maybe because we are only two states now we have gay states.

02:16.910 --> 02:21.170
So for any FFA, how will we calculate FFA?

02:21.440 --> 02:27.080
By simply moving on to F of a minus one f of a minus two.

02:27.290 --> 02:27.950
And so on.

02:27.950 --> 02:28.940
The life of a minus.

02:31.810 --> 02:32.050
Eight.

02:32.470 --> 02:39.550
And yes, we will be having these ghost values with them, which is FFA, which is at your fee, minus

02:39.880 --> 02:43.300
at your value, minus one and its absolute value.

02:43.300 --> 02:46.720
And so whichever will be the best will take them.

02:47.440 --> 02:51.480
So it's very similar to the previous problem we had only to regions.

02:51.490 --> 02:53.290
We had to check only for two transactions.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.300
Now we are checking for previous transitions.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.580
Nothing, nothing.

02:57.580 --> 02:57.970
Big deal.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.270
Okay, so let me quickly call this out.

03:03.770 --> 03:04.040
So.

03:04.370 --> 03:06.200
Okay, so may zero and one offered.

03:07.510 --> 03:07.870
Great.

03:09.010 --> 03:13.210
Now here, what we need is we need another variable called key eight.

03:13.210 --> 03:14.740
So it's an.

03:15.730 --> 03:19.060
And it's input the key values.

03:20.360 --> 03:20.750
Okay.

03:21.500 --> 03:21.800
Right.

03:22.160 --> 03:29.460
So the P0 is filled and DP one is filled, but it's coded from the beginning.

03:29.460 --> 03:29.750
Right.

03:30.700 --> 03:36.730
What are the values of geek is gay values are one 200 and will be given to us right to kick in or be

03:36.730 --> 03:37.090
zero.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.070
So yeah, this should work.

03:39.430 --> 03:45.900
Every one should work eight because if gave us zero then this should not have been a valid statement.

03:45.910 --> 03:49.270
Eight Online 28 five deep value was zero.

03:49.270 --> 03:55.960
That means I cannot go being the rate, but if given a zero, I cannot go behind even one step.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.870
Okay, well, start from one so we can do this.

03:58.990 --> 04:00.490
Let it start from two and.

04:01.610 --> 04:08.720
Let's called another variable called a black hole, which starts from zero and ghosting.

04:09.710 --> 04:10.100
It all.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.930
It's it starts from one end.

04:11.930 --> 04:12.290
Goes to.

04:14.580 --> 04:18.630
So initially, let's mark deep of it.

04:18.630 --> 04:20.340
We call two very big values eight.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.570
Let's call it in the mix, a big value.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.750
And now what I have to do is for all the transitions, I have to take the best one.

04:28.080 --> 04:32.490
What I'll do is I'll simply say goodbye as it goes to a minimum of BBA comma.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.690
This transition date when transition to transition through transition.

04:37.690 --> 04:38.950
And so until they transition.

04:39.640 --> 04:40.620
So how do we have there?

04:41.110 --> 04:45.400
It is A-minus, but again, less absolute value.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.670
So this is a cost and good part that MySpace.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.390
I think the minimum of all those values very easy.

04:54.640 --> 04:55.570
So how can I do this?

04:56.290 --> 05:01.900
There will be absolute values of a minus, absolute value of etch double.

05:02.410 --> 05:02.610
Okay.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.060
It should be I imaginatively.

05:05.350 --> 05:05.610
Well.

05:05.920 --> 05:10.840
So we have these w this transition that these many jumps he can take, that means he can come from these

05:10.840 --> 05:17.820
diseases, places with this cost, which is the best when give give it to me environment taking into

05:17.890 --> 05:24.310
magazine easily because I want to find out some minimum possible solution.

05:25.670 --> 05:30.140
So I have to find out the minimum possible solution to how do I do that in initialized with something

05:30.140 --> 05:32.750
very big and continuously take minimums.

05:33.320 --> 05:34.790
So we'll get the minimum on all of them.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.860
We'll go after this.

05:36.860 --> 05:38.960
Lumens what I need to print.

05:39.140 --> 05:39.420
Yeah.

05:39.450 --> 05:40.310
Libyan minus one.

05:41.030 --> 05:41.420
Sick.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.710
It is in this case.

05:44.770 --> 05:45.170
Great.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.690
For the second case.

05:48.690 --> 05:50.740
Let's check it out for Andy.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.600
Yes, folks.

05:52.410 --> 05:53.430
Now it is.

05:54.410 --> 05:57.200
100, it should give zero grade.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.130
And this is the final look.

06:00.110 --> 06:04.910
This is just one more thing that I wanted to discuss, which is tracing back the P values.

06:05.540 --> 06:06.170
I just want.

06:07.070 --> 06:12.590
To explain this to you, because this will make dynamic programming even more clear to all of you.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.810
So here we are getting 40.

06:15.350 --> 06:16.480
Yeah, of course we get some.

06:16.490 --> 06:17.880
It doesn't really get the right answer.

06:17.900 --> 06:20.480
So before submitting this.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.960
Or I wish to like.

06:26.040 --> 06:30.840
Tell you how to trace things back because that's kind of very important.

06:32.660 --> 06:35.750
And I give you a very good cold to trace things back.

06:36.170 --> 06:36.740
So what?

06:36.800 --> 06:37.930
How does tracing work?

06:37.940 --> 06:39.050
What the stressing mean?

06:39.440 --> 06:45.470
This thing means that if DP and minus one is a solution of 40, then where did this fatigue come from?

06:46.590 --> 06:49.860
This is we're tracing we're tracing back the steps.

06:50.220 --> 06:53.880
So let me firstly print out all the DB values.

06:55.930 --> 06:57.010
And then we'll trace back.

06:57.700 --> 06:58.960
Because this is very important.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.850
Guys, believe me, you're.

07:01.030 --> 07:01.540
It's like.

07:02.050 --> 07:07.090
It will increase your deep understanding by 20% rate.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.130
So let me trace it back.

07:09.400 --> 07:09.640
Yeah.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.170
So these are the values.

07:11.170 --> 07:14.680
And let me copy it down a note here.

07:17.930 --> 07:18.380
Okay.

07:26.670 --> 07:28.200
It's 28.

07:30.090 --> 07:33.360
These are the deep values rate for the indexes that we have.

07:39.590 --> 07:41.300
But let me quickly index them.

07:41.480 --> 07:47.030
So it is zero to indicate first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.750
So the total area value is an eight.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.240
I'm not going off topic.

07:52.250 --> 07:56.510
This is the most important topic actually, and I want to figure it out.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.030
How did this value actually come?

07:59.160 --> 07:59.400
Right.

07:59.420 --> 08:02.720
So before that, I need to copy all these values which are.

08:04.120 --> 08:04.540
This.

08:06.040 --> 08:06.520
40.

08:07.780 --> 08:08.110
Okay.

08:08.260 --> 08:09.040
Let me have.

08:10.470 --> 08:10.830
Another.

08:10.830 --> 08:10.830
The.

08:11.820 --> 08:14.160
These are the deep values maybe of.

08:15.790 --> 08:16.030
Now.

08:16.030 --> 08:17.260
I live at JFK.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.320
At the height of the storm.

08:19.950 --> 08:21.030
The first is 40.

08:23.860 --> 08:27.220
2070 ten.

08:29.820 --> 08:35.010
20, 70, 80, 20, 70, 80 and 60.

08:35.910 --> 08:36.870
This is very important.

08:36.870 --> 08:37.110
Eight.

08:38.360 --> 08:38.530
So.

08:38.590 --> 08:38.830
Yeah.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.790
Please come with me.

08:41.760 --> 08:42.380
Who are?

08:43.570 --> 08:45.370
It was two for eight.

08:45.460 --> 08:46.690
And anything was true that.

08:47.630 --> 08:51.560
These are the deep values that we finally found out using the recursion that we made.

08:52.070 --> 08:58.100
And these are that values that we found out that we were already given in the input and the ways we

08:58.100 --> 08:59.870
know deep of zero should be zero.

09:00.410 --> 09:01.160
No doubt in that.

09:01.950 --> 09:02.210
Eight.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.800
How is DPI of one being calculated?

09:04.800 --> 09:09.900
We have already seen the debut of one is being calculated by taking the p zero plus absolute value of

09:09.900 --> 09:11.370
edge one minus edge zero.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.350
But again, it wouldn't be an issue.

09:13.700 --> 09:14.790
It depends 30.

09:15.790 --> 09:15.970
Okay.

09:16.090 --> 09:17.110
So why is the preventative?

09:17.110 --> 09:21.580
Because it is zero plus or minus ten, which is the difference in the HIV values.

09:22.240 --> 09:22.510
Well.

09:23.600 --> 09:23.930
Great.

09:24.080 --> 09:27.740
So basically, I'll do that later.

09:28.740 --> 09:31.320
Their overall mark the index's.

09:32.690 --> 09:35.390
I kind of represent them as a dedicated group.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.400
Then there should be this nine pool.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.880
So these are the graph nodes.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.490
You have graph nodes from 0 to 9.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.190
They're indexes.

09:49.550 --> 09:51.530
And we can see that we have got the.

09:52.510 --> 09:54.400
EPI one value from deep zero.

09:55.030 --> 09:55.960
I'll just make an error.

09:56.470 --> 10:02.080
That means if one actually came from deep zero with the cost of an.

10:03.230 --> 10:05.720
We'll start with the cluster of 38.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.610
That's where the P value is 30.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.220
Now, let's talk about the DP two.

10:10.220 --> 10:15.290
Well, so DP values 28 and RJ values 20 itself, right?

10:15.440 --> 10:20.510
So this DP, do you know that KC goes to four so far, two where could have.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.490
To in from debate to value.

10:24.490 --> 10:28.990
It can either come from zero or one because of course KC goes to four.

10:28.990 --> 10:31.330
But we don't we do not have four indexes behind us.

10:31.810 --> 10:33.340
There can only be two transitions.

10:33.760 --> 10:34.010
Eight.

10:34.390 --> 10:35.260
So what is deep?

10:35.260 --> 10:42.280
Zero It is 43 it is zero zero plus 20 -40 is 28.

10:42.280 --> 10:42.760
So it is.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.350
Zero plus 20.

10:46.470 --> 10:52.530
And from one, what I get is it is 30 because DP one is 30 plus.

10:52.590 --> 10:57.390
The transition from 1 to 2 will give me ten minus one BS and eight.

10:57.540 --> 11:00.230
So what is the meaning of among them was it is 20.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.920
So that's where we have to be off.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.830
Do we go through 28 the minimum of these two transitions?

11:05.340 --> 11:06.540
So here we can see that.

11:06.540 --> 11:06.810
Okay.

11:06.870 --> 11:10.200
The B2 also came from zero.

11:12.180 --> 11:12.480
Eight.

11:13.330 --> 11:14.890
And what we have here is.

11:14.890 --> 11:15.160
Yeah.

11:15.190 --> 11:16.390
So let me quickly.

11:16.390 --> 11:17.020
It is this.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.170
Right now, what is the next value we have?

11:24.190 --> 11:27.310
The next value we have is three three rate.

11:27.310 --> 11:28.450
So Lipitor is 30.

11:30.040 --> 11:30.210
Cool.

11:30.460 --> 11:38.530
So this tree, this transition could have ever come from zero one or 281 jump from 010 from one of random

11:38.530 --> 11:38.950
from two.

11:39.640 --> 11:46.270
So as I already told you that we can't we don't count to jump right now, why are we not taking two

11:46.270 --> 11:46.540
gems?

11:46.540 --> 11:48.130
Why can't we take this transition?

11:48.260 --> 11:53.200
Is it if tree would have gone from one, it would have either going to two or and then it would have

11:53.200 --> 11:53.800
gone to three.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.020
Why are we not taking this?

11:56.080 --> 11:57.850
Because what do we already have?

11:57.850 --> 11:59.480
The best answer eight.

11:59.710 --> 12:06.340
So if this was the case that from one it came to two, and then from two it came to three, the answer

12:06.340 --> 12:09.550
would be coming from this particular part.

12:10.770 --> 12:12.870
So we're not taking this on the transition.

12:12.870 --> 12:15.270
I've been repeating this because it's really important.

12:16.260 --> 12:19.830
Here's many here's where many students stuck.

12:20.310 --> 12:23.010
They keep on like digging inside that.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.970
If true, then it can come from one or it can directly come from one.

12:26.220 --> 12:27.930
We have to worry about only one transition.

12:27.930 --> 12:28.920
Only one transition.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.240
That's eight.

12:32.030 --> 12:34.340
So from 1 to 2, 2 to 3 grade.

12:34.430 --> 12:34.730
Okay.

12:34.910 --> 12:38.360
So here we have from 0 to 3, we are going from 0 to 3.

12:38.630 --> 12:40.940
So what is deep 020 and.

12:43.550 --> 12:43.820
Yeah.

12:43.820 --> 12:45.050
We can go from 0 to 8.

12:47.950 --> 12:54.010
PDP zero zero and the transition from 0 to 3 will be 40 -70 with just 30.

12:55.210 --> 12:55.480
Eight.

12:55.660 --> 12:58.240
But what is the deep with --?

12:58.990 --> 13:01.810
But I'm not writing a book.

13:01.810 --> 13:02.950
Let me write another also.

13:03.370 --> 13:10.060
It is 30 plus 60 for the one for this transition and for the honor the transition from two.

13:10.090 --> 13:15.160
It is 20 plus 20 -70, which is 50.

13:15.820 --> 13:17.620
Again, the is the minimum is from zero.

13:17.950 --> 13:19.720
We can easily see that baby three.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.850
Is also made from BP zero.

13:23.350 --> 13:24.580
That's what I want to show you.

13:24.580 --> 13:28.670
Like how to trace back things, how to find the best but eight.

13:29.020 --> 13:30.540
Because let's say the problems.

13:30.550 --> 13:35.650
Is it okay if you have found the best answer that means that okay.

13:35.650 --> 13:37.120
This is the minimum value that the.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.970
Rock can make for all the germs.

13:40.970 --> 13:42.470
Still n minus one then.

13:43.710 --> 13:45.180
Like print out the indexes.

13:45.430 --> 13:50.730
Let's say that print out one of the parts from which this value is actually coming from.

13:50.730 --> 13:51.900
Where did you get this answer?

13:52.140 --> 13:54.870
Basically, the whole part will print the whole.

13:54.870 --> 13:56.880
But after this explanation is done.

13:58.000 --> 13:58.300
Yeah.

13:58.750 --> 14:01.810
In the next, uh, in the next step, what happens is.

14:03.290 --> 14:11.730
So this part is actually I'm doing it by you know, I'm writing on the screen and you're looking to

14:11.730 --> 14:18.270
this, but it's really very easy when you put it out and I took all this out so that it becomes very

14:18.270 --> 14:19.920
easy for you all to go this out.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.370
They write notes for explanation purposes, so it's sticking time.

14:23.980 --> 14:25.320
But what is deep before 40?

14:25.860 --> 14:26.580
This 40.

14:27.910 --> 14:28.840
Would have come from.

14:30.290 --> 14:30.560
Yeah.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.890
And that it can come from 012 or three eight.

14:32.930 --> 14:36.850
All for our value to I think this 40 has come from zero eight.

14:36.860 --> 14:41.330
So let me make another rule which is that yes, this is the transition.

14:47.290 --> 14:48.940
Well for the next one.

14:49.150 --> 14:50.980
The next one is the buffet, which is.

14:52.530 --> 14:52.920
30.

14:53.930 --> 14:59.270
Like this 30 would have come from something smaller than this.

15:00.110 --> 15:03.530
Of course, because I cannot read something negative.

15:03.530 --> 15:03.820
Right.

15:03.830 --> 15:06.240
Because I'm 40, I cannot make 30.

15:06.260 --> 15:08.600
That means deep five has not come from me before.

15:08.870 --> 15:15.040
It has either come from the repeatedly toward one and not even zero way because it's about four transitions.

15:15.050 --> 15:16.280
Casey goes to four, right?

15:16.670 --> 15:18.500
But here we have four deep.

15:18.510 --> 15:24.050
If I add that it can come from four, the two or one, and here the zero will not be included.

15:25.690 --> 15:25.960
Right.

15:26.290 --> 15:27.910
So what do I have here is.

15:28.630 --> 15:28.890
Yeah.

15:28.900 --> 15:32.700
So let me quickly write their prices from 40.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.510
Whatever it's coming it is 40 plus.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.580
80 minus ten, which is 70.

15:37.120 --> 15:37.460
No.

15:38.080 --> 15:43.120
Now from three we're discussing this 30 plus 70 minus ten, which is 60.

15:43.450 --> 15:44.170
I don't think so.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.130
It is coming from three.

15:45.640 --> 15:45.910
There it is.

15:45.910 --> 15:49.450
20 plus 20 minus ten.

15:50.820 --> 15:51.890
Which is ten.

15:52.410 --> 15:52.800
Yes.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.810
And for one, it is 30 plus.

15:57.020 --> 15:58.850
Ten minus ten, which is zero.

15:58.850 --> 16:00.620
So here we have a table to eight.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.010
That means from two places we are getting 30, which is actually be five.

16:04.920 --> 16:05.180
Hey.

16:05.490 --> 16:09.990
So now, guys, from any place, from any of this place, we can take this.

16:10.590 --> 16:16.020
It doesn't matter what we want it to be one of many moments that it doesn't matter that it is coming

16:16.020 --> 16:17.640
from one place or two place or trip.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.030
It's like there are hundreds of combinations of this.

16:20.640 --> 16:21.640
That doesn't matter, right?

16:21.650 --> 16:22.770
I just have to find one.

16:22.770 --> 16:25.200
But I just could bring one part.

16:25.200 --> 16:25.470
Right?

16:25.500 --> 16:27.510
If you want to print all the bars, you have to use it.

16:27.510 --> 16:29.250
He goes in with backtracking and printing.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.400
It's a different stuff.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.230
Let's not go there.

16:32.250 --> 16:32.700
So.

16:34.150 --> 16:37.300
Yeah, but it can come from two or it can come from one.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.500
We can take it from any place.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.780
Say So let's make this transition.

16:43.330 --> 16:44.830
So I'm just taking it from two.

16:47.510 --> 16:50.210
But what's what's my motive behind this, guys?

16:50.330 --> 16:52.190
What's the motive behind expanding you all this?

16:52.490 --> 16:54.140
It is very simple that.

16:55.040 --> 16:55.930
If that.

16:55.940 --> 16:58.430
Okay, let's consider the rebels only of this land.

16:58.880 --> 16:59.630
Land six.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.480
I want to find out if I start from zero.

17:02.690 --> 17:03.980
What is the best way I can?

17:04.280 --> 17:05.950
We want to fight hate.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.270
So what I do is trace back from fight.

17:08.600 --> 17:12.320
From 5i5 actually came from two and two came from zero.

17:12.920 --> 17:16.100
So here I only have two jumps which are from.

17:17.420 --> 17:22.850
Index zero two index two to index five, which is from 40.

17:22.850 --> 17:26.990
It will move on to 20 and it will move on to ten.

17:27.570 --> 17:28.700
So what is the relevance?

17:28.730 --> 17:30.410
The minimum is 30 and that's the final.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.050
So you can see why I am making the connection.

17:33.050 --> 17:34.310
Zero eight.

17:35.740 --> 17:37.480
It looks similarly, guys.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.220
You can make the connections.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.470
Okay, let me do this now.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.970
I will a little quicker.

17:43.540 --> 17:47.140
Those six is 20 and I would be 60 strongly.

17:47.140 --> 17:50.860
So I think it is coming from two only because people five are not valid.

17:51.460 --> 17:55.180
So yeah, let's let me make this arrow from two.

17:56.380 --> 17:57.280
Why is it coming from two?

17:57.280 --> 17:59.890
Because they produced 20 or 20 plus one.

17:59.890 --> 18:00.730
Domains zero.

18:01.040 --> 18:01.300
Right.

18:02.110 --> 18:05.410
Now, let's move on to the next part, which is seven.

18:06.490 --> 18:07.600
Ruby seven is 30.

18:08.580 --> 18:10.530
So it is not coming from six.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.520
It is not coming from five.

18:12.930 --> 18:14.520
It is not coming from four.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.530
It is coming from three eight from three.

18:19.920 --> 18:24.610
It is actually 30 plus 70 -70, which is 32.

18:25.140 --> 18:30.240
So if seven is followed by DP three, and let's talk about DP eight.

18:31.390 --> 18:32.320
Maybe it is 40.

18:32.790 --> 18:34.150
It is 40 plus.

18:34.990 --> 18:36.100
Let's get back.

18:36.890 --> 18:37.420
No, it's not.

18:37.660 --> 18:38.860
Yeah, it's coming from seven.

18:38.860 --> 18:39.370
Only eight.

18:39.370 --> 18:40.660
So it is seven to it.

18:41.950 --> 18:44.410
Well, you can cross-check this once and.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.400
Where is DP nine coming from?

18:48.030 --> 18:49.920
I need also for research not coming from it.

18:50.970 --> 18:52.140
It is coming from seven.

18:52.390 --> 18:54.450
So maybe nine year olds are going from seven.

18:55.570 --> 18:56.530
How it is.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.920
40 plus 70 -60.

19:01.060 --> 19:01.300
Well.

19:04.340 --> 19:04.700
No.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.510
It is 30 plus 71 and 68.

19:07.520 --> 19:12.350
So it is giving me 40, but the B 90 is actually coming from 97.

19:12.690 --> 19:13.950
So here you can see the transitions.

19:13.970 --> 19:21.230
Now, if I want to find out what is the odds that the frog should be actually from 0 to 9 the morning

19:21.230 --> 19:24.680
Louise and start racing back from that nine came from seven.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.690
So this is what this is about.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.250
Then seven came from three.

19:31.110 --> 19:33.000
Intriguing from zero.

19:33.820 --> 19:34.050
Okay.

19:34.180 --> 19:35.710
So what are the stores he lived on?

19:35.770 --> 19:37.030
What are the highs of those stones?

19:37.030 --> 19:37.870
It is 40.

19:38.350 --> 19:39.820
Then he went to 70.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.010
Then he went to 70.

19:42.550 --> 19:43.990
Then he went to 60.

19:44.630 --> 19:46.740
You can see the differences between them.

19:46.750 --> 19:51.280
We have this 30 different zero zero difference here and ten differences.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.870
So the total is 40.

19:53.850 --> 19:54.310
Always.

19:54.570 --> 19:57.150
I hope you understood what this tracing back means.

19:58.440 --> 20:01.950
And now what I'll do is I'll simply record this tracing back stuff.

20:03.110 --> 20:03.780
And of.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.110
But I'm not.

20:05.790 --> 20:06.670
So I'm not from me.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.350
I'm submitting it again and again.

20:09.130 --> 20:10.410
You're going to try this yourself?

20:10.420 --> 20:12.790
I'll save the code and the code will be available to you.

20:13.630 --> 20:13.890
It.

20:15.510 --> 20:15.780
Okay.

20:15.780 --> 20:18.930
So let me open the you one file here.

20:18.930 --> 20:21.930
We had this recursive approaches.

20:21.990 --> 20:23.550
Hey, let me trace back.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.410
Let's trace back once.

20:25.620 --> 20:26.670
I'm just quoting it once.

20:27.090 --> 20:27.990
Not needed, although.

20:29.340 --> 20:31.290
But yes, you should know how to do this.

20:32.570 --> 20:34.820
So let's write a function.

20:34.830 --> 20:41.750
Let's see who and what it will do is it will print the indexes on which our discourse.

20:42.760 --> 20:43.060
Eight.

20:43.920 --> 20:47.800
So Google started from index and the last index.

20:48.030 --> 20:49.740
So let's say go from and minus one.

20:50.490 --> 20:54.090
What it will do is it will say, okay, this and minus one came from this position.

20:54.090 --> 20:56.070
Then that came from this position and so on.

20:57.330 --> 20:59.220
So call the function, go in minus one.

20:59.220 --> 21:03.780
And here instead of indexes that say index or we can take another value but leave it.

21:04.810 --> 21:05.170
Now.

21:06.510 --> 21:08.130
How will this function figure out?

21:08.310 --> 21:10.710
What are the deep values you have for that?

21:10.710 --> 21:11.880
You also need to possess it.

21:12.690 --> 21:19.290
If you're taking it globally, it's very good and I think I should take it globally because I also have

21:19.290 --> 21:19.890
an inky.

21:21.100 --> 21:23.170
So let me take this globally.

21:24.370 --> 21:24.820
And.

21:30.690 --> 21:31.650
Is it 25?

21:35.840 --> 21:36.170
And then.

21:36.440 --> 21:37.400
And this Eddie.

21:42.400 --> 21:42.670
Well.

21:43.730 --> 21:44.940
Oh, yeah.

21:44.990 --> 21:46.100
I don't think they should be.

21:46.640 --> 21:46.970
Okay.

21:47.270 --> 21:48.790
I also have to do the DPD.

21:56.960 --> 21:57.220
Great.

21:57.890 --> 21:59.840
I'm starting from the last index and.

22:01.610 --> 22:07.250
And simply in the last few days, because I have to go to Disney next week if you want to do the development

22:07.250 --> 22:10.820
in this just ordered in a veterinary wizard and print it wouldn't be an issue.

22:11.900 --> 22:15.940
And now what I do is I simply move my phone.

22:15.950 --> 22:17.210
Look, I'll just pick this up.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.020
Let's pick this up.

22:19.550 --> 22:21.260
Double Cuban eight.

22:21.740 --> 22:27.950
And what I do here is I'd say if we had this reconciliation generate the DBS minimum of this year,

22:27.980 --> 22:30.410
what I'll do is I'll simply say if.

22:31.250 --> 22:35.210
DPRK is equal to or instead of a.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.650
What we have is we have an index.

22:37.130 --> 22:38.270
Let's call this.

22:38.270 --> 22:38.870
I only.

22:39.970 --> 22:40.240
Well.

22:41.440 --> 22:45.730
So if DPA is equal, should be I mean, it's double plus absolute value of this.

22:46.060 --> 22:51.790
That means it has came from this location because that's where the minimum is being formed.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.330
So what is happening?

22:53.330 --> 22:55.060
You're just going one, one step behind this.

22:55.060 --> 22:57.940
Taking all the values was value added matches.

22:58.300 --> 22:59.110
It will simply.

23:00.860 --> 23:01.130
See.

23:01.550 --> 23:05.420
Go to this particular index, which is are you minus W and.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.040
Police.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.810
And is there anything we need to take care of?

23:11.840 --> 23:12.250
Yes.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.770
So these are important things.

23:13.830 --> 23:13.970
You.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.210
I also have missed it.

23:18.620 --> 23:22.660
You can go to values of very large values, right.

23:22.680 --> 23:24.160
Which are like still underneath.

23:24.180 --> 23:27.390
So let's save double glazed in and eyes, only two.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.050
So two minus two and luminous here.

23:29.070 --> 23:35.310
So here we we might get a segmentation for when I'm doing a minus kick without taking that, whether

23:35.310 --> 23:36.720
it is greater than equal to zero or not.

23:37.090 --> 23:38.580
So what I do is I would simply say.

23:39.400 --> 23:44.500
And let's add in the condition that A-minus should be greater than or equal to zero.

23:45.540 --> 23:46.380
Not a big issue.

23:47.250 --> 23:47.510
Well.

23:48.180 --> 23:50.460
So let me add this condition over here also.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.000
If the opposite goes really bad, Minsky replies.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.200
Absolute value of whatever.

23:55.680 --> 24:00.450
It will simply go to that particular next and do the same stuff again and it will bring those values.

24:00.750 --> 24:09.120
And he goes, If I ever put the written statement over here, because if I match one back transition,

24:09.120 --> 24:11.280
if I go to just one transition, I simply go back.

24:11.640 --> 24:15.120
If you want to print all the transition, then just remove written here.

24:15.130 --> 24:19.020
It will like go like a recursive and a backtracking approach basically.

24:20.070 --> 24:20.340
Well.

24:21.380 --> 24:22.070
It's been this.

24:24.140 --> 24:26.330
So what we have is we have 9730.

24:26.330 --> 24:33.830
So here we have on this indexing, it's two plus one and ABC and seven, ten, eight for one, which

24:33.830 --> 24:34.880
is 60.

24:36.130 --> 24:37.180
270.

24:38.250 --> 24:41.040
Two 7240.

24:42.070 --> 24:42.370
Eight.

24:43.120 --> 24:44.860
So that's why we are getting.

24:46.790 --> 24:50.710
This value, which is let's print the baby.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.300
It goes for TV on.

24:53.820 --> 24:59.460
Well, there's another very easy stuff here using the codes, and you can very easily calculate this.

24:59.490 --> 25:01.410
Of course, you can also do this using.

25:02.630 --> 25:05.150
To find love wouldn't be an issue instead of it.

25:05.150 --> 25:06.070
And you have to break it.

25:06.070 --> 25:11.150
Do nothing else this, break it and move that index to that position again.

25:11.450 --> 25:13.130
If on the same thing, break it.

25:13.130 --> 25:15.410
When you find the answer, just move it to that place.

25:16.570 --> 25:16.780
Eight.

25:18.360 --> 25:19.570
So this is it.

25:19.590 --> 25:20.610
About the second problem.

25:20.610 --> 25:23.310
I hope we have learned something new because the problem was in this way.

25:23.310 --> 25:26.250
I thought I had something else in this which is backtracking.

25:26.850 --> 25:27.120
Right.

25:27.690 --> 25:29.040
So we'll see in the next part, I think.
