00:00.930 --> 00:02.130
Everyone, welcome back.

00:02.640 --> 00:05.990
So this is our next problem, which is independence.

00:06.810 --> 00:07.860
The big problem.

00:07.950 --> 00:08.480
And.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.980
This problem will introduce you to any of your entries.

00:12.760 --> 00:17.800
Again, I'll be repeating the same thing that okay, if you were not able to solve this problem at one

00:17.800 --> 00:21.130
go, because of course these topics might be new to you.

00:21.130 --> 00:21.490
Right?

00:22.330 --> 00:22.630
So.

00:23.780 --> 00:27.170
Just understand what is deep your intrigues, how does depositories work?

00:27.920 --> 00:33.140
Of course, before this you should know what is she how worried are treated as actually how to perform

00:33.140 --> 00:34.660
DFS DFS on trees.

00:35.270 --> 00:37.760
Those are basic utilities of trees.

00:39.050 --> 00:44.900
Before moving on, I would be saying this said yes, it's fine if you're able to solve all of these

00:44.900 --> 00:46.000
problems in one go.

00:46.010 --> 00:49.180
Right, because that's what these problems are doing.

00:49.190 --> 00:53.990
They're introducing you to different types of dynamic programming, new training, programming topics.

00:54.770 --> 00:59.150
But after solving these problems, then you can move on to the different types of problems.

01:00.420 --> 01:02.250
On dynamic programming, which I do.

01:03.390 --> 01:10.110
So after completing this problem, Independent said, I would suggest you, I suggest you some problems

01:10.110 --> 01:15.130
from sports of visual, which would like Anansi or Beatrice knowledge.

01:15.680 --> 01:16.260
Let's begin.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.040
These are tribute and words.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.630
Number one twin to air begins.

01:20.630 --> 01:25.430
The end is tended to five and the identical next vertex x and y.

01:25.580 --> 01:26.730
So it's normal t.

01:26.750 --> 01:29.480
So how many edges are the unity and minus one?

01:29.930 --> 01:33.410
I thought we decided to paint each vertex white or black.

01:34.600 --> 01:34.890
Okay.

01:34.900 --> 01:38.590
Here it is not allowed to paint too at the scene where this is both in black.

01:39.370 --> 01:40.540
So this is the main part.

01:40.750 --> 01:46.050
So we have to color the words either white or black, but we cannot color too.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.640
For a decent word, it has to be black.

01:50.400 --> 01:55.310
So how many number of ways in which words can be painted?

01:55.350 --> 02:01.310
So we are to find out the number of eight and as the number of which can be huge, we have to modulate

02:01.320 --> 02:02.370
into the by name the civil.

02:03.890 --> 02:04.190
Eight.

02:05.820 --> 02:06.960
So this is the input phone.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.430
So here we can see that we have five ways of painting this tree.

02:10.440 --> 02:10.950
The trees.

02:10.950 --> 02:13.230
One, two and two, two, three, eight.

02:13.650 --> 02:17.210
So the first phase paint all white because there is no constraint on white.

02:17.220 --> 02:23.550
We can paint everything not to be white that the only constraint is on black that we cannot paint.

02:23.550 --> 02:24.810
And just in order to be black.

02:25.330 --> 02:27.130
The second one is one, two, three, eight.

02:27.150 --> 02:29.670
We can easily see that there are no two at the same note.

02:29.680 --> 02:30.720
So we are black again.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.100
One, two, three, one.

02:32.490 --> 02:34.230
Okay, so the black is in the middle.

02:34.230 --> 02:39.930
In the third example, in the fourth we can see three is black and in the fifth we can see one in three

02:39.930 --> 02:40.380
are black.

02:41.560 --> 02:41.820
Well.

02:42.850 --> 02:47.740
And what a simple input to sew, disassemble input to which or.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.200
One, two, two, one, two, three.

02:50.200 --> 02:50.920
One, two, four.

02:51.130 --> 02:51.520
Great.

02:52.150 --> 02:53.530
And this is the tree.

02:53.800 --> 02:58.360
Now, we can easily see that we have nine different ways of bending this tree and.

02:59.640 --> 03:03.300
That's that the above constraints are specified, right?

03:03.810 --> 03:08.010
So the under example is the third example which has only one node.

03:08.010 --> 03:10.770
And of course there will be no edges because we have only one node.

03:11.430 --> 03:14.010
How many is there to colour it black or white?

03:14.190 --> 03:18.540
It is two is at the color node one black or white.

03:18.870 --> 03:24.750
And now we have a bigger kind of but it's a bigger input which we can.

03:25.760 --> 03:30.980
Senator Ford to check whether it's working on a list of all.

03:30.980 --> 03:34.360
Let me introduce you to our dynamic programming on trees.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.610
Oh, it's the maestro topic here.

03:41.170 --> 03:43.700
But this becomes beyond peace.

03:44.800 --> 03:49.840
Whenever we are trying to solve some problems related to Libya and Greece, what we consider will always

03:49.840 --> 03:50.440
consider.

03:51.440 --> 03:56.030
The final answer with respect to a subtree eight.

03:56.210 --> 03:59.630
So we know that subdivided with respect to a root node, right?

03:59.720 --> 04:03.230
If I have a road node, then only I can figure it out.

04:03.230 --> 04:05.080
Suppose basically what I mean in disease.

04:05.090 --> 04:08.540
Let's say I have this 3.12 entry rate.

04:09.230 --> 04:12.460
If I consider one as a root node, then this is a subtree.

04:12.470 --> 04:14.390
This is a subtree and this is a subtree.

04:14.870 --> 04:17.810
Okay, so the subtree root needed one is the whole tree.

04:18.370 --> 04:18.790
Thanks.

04:19.220 --> 04:21.260
But what if I consider two as a root node?

04:21.260 --> 04:22.880
So let's consider two as that would not.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.240
Then we can easily see that these will be the levels of the nodes.

04:26.780 --> 04:31.550
So here we can see that this is a subtree one, three subtree and two entries.

04:31.550 --> 04:32.000
Three, the subtree.

04:33.110 --> 04:34.820
So what are the different examples?

04:35.090 --> 04:36.920
What are the difference in them?

04:37.220 --> 04:42.680
The difference is, is that we had three as a separate with a subtree and one, two and three as a separate.

04:42.770 --> 04:43.400
So here we had.

04:44.820 --> 04:45.390
These three.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.950
It ought to be trees of trees.

04:46.950 --> 04:53.610
But see the difference tree as a subtree one tree as a subtree and two as a subtree three, two and

04:53.610 --> 04:55.140
three as a separate where.

04:55.140 --> 04:57.210
Two, one, two, one, three.

04:57.240 --> 05:00.330
This is the subtree which represents the whole tree, because this is the root.

05:00.330 --> 05:03.990
Not always subtree is with respect to a root.

05:03.990 --> 05:04.500
Not right.

05:04.980 --> 05:11.640
So whenever we are trying to solve this problem, first of all, we will fix the root north node can

05:11.640 --> 05:12.240
be any node.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.770
It doesn't matter, right?

05:14.490 --> 05:14.940
Because.

05:17.100 --> 05:22.320
Just think of being covered in this way that if you change, there are no numbers.

05:22.740 --> 05:22.910
Okay.

05:23.010 --> 05:27.960
Let's say you find a founder down the hall to you with considering one is that it would not know if

05:27.960 --> 05:35.400
you change the numbers of the the three and now one is somewhere else eight but in some other do we

05:35.400 --> 05:36.780
can have the same structure?

05:36.990 --> 05:39.600
The structure is same, but just the no numbers are changed.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.940
That won't make any difference to the answer.

05:41.980 --> 05:42.210
Why?

05:42.220 --> 05:48.230
Because answer always depends on the structure of the two and not on the node numbers eight.

05:49.580 --> 05:54.980
But what I mean to say is that the answer for this three will be equal to the answer for District eight,

05:54.980 --> 05:59.420
because these structures are seen, they have the same structure no matter what is the root node.

06:00.440 --> 06:00.710
Eight.

06:01.580 --> 06:02.060
So.

06:02.300 --> 06:02.570
Yeah.

06:03.750 --> 06:04.170
Okay.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.730
I have to close it, I guess.

06:06.570 --> 06:07.170
Just a second.

06:13.310 --> 06:14.640
So all of it gone.

06:15.110 --> 06:15.630
No problem.

06:15.660 --> 06:16.490
I understood it.

06:18.170 --> 06:24.080
Let's move on to the next part, which is the first part I've already explained will consider subjects,

06:24.080 --> 06:26.900
will consider a route or will fix surgery with a route node.

06:27.200 --> 06:27.530
Right.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.540
So let's take this example.

06:30.470 --> 06:32.390
Let's take this example of this one.

06:33.080 --> 06:38.870
So here we can see we have an edge from 1 to 2, one, two, three and 1 to 4.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.240
Right now I'm fixing one.

06:40.250 --> 06:43.170
I would note that two wins on the top, right?

06:43.670 --> 06:45.290
I have to collect these nodes.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.520
So, guys, every node can be either color colored, black or white.

06:50.030 --> 06:51.290
So every note has two options.

06:51.300 --> 06:56.090
So how many possibilities are there to color all these nodes to the power and possibilities?

06:56.630 --> 06:58.100
Because every word has two options.

06:58.100 --> 06:58.370
Right?

06:58.610 --> 07:05.460
But all these possibilities are when when we can like color to adjusting nodes to be black.

07:05.460 --> 07:05.660
Right.

07:06.050 --> 07:11.810
The only constant is that we don't have we don't want to color two edges in order to be black eight.

07:12.990 --> 07:17.940
So yeah, let's, let's try and think about the lymph nodes first.

07:17.970 --> 07:18.240
Right.

07:18.240 --> 07:22.980
So we are moving bottom of basically we are thinking with the lymph nodes first, then we'll consider

07:22.980 --> 07:26.580
the one node with one level above it.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.800
Then we'll consider nodes readable above levels.

07:28.810 --> 07:30.600
So let's talk about the lymph nodes.

07:31.140 --> 07:34.320
It's an extraordinary number, two, three and four, eight.

07:34.470 --> 07:37.530
So what are the number of ways of coloring node number two black.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.120
It is one way.

07:39.390 --> 07:41.370
What are the number of ways of coloring?

07:41.370 --> 07:42.660
Node number two is white.

07:42.750 --> 07:43.410
It is one way.

07:43.410 --> 07:45.360
So I'm writing black on the left and right on the right.

07:46.050 --> 07:49.740
Well, let me make it a little bigger.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.590
This is fun.

07:54.550 --> 07:55.600
Stick this to.

07:55.660 --> 07:58.870
Let's take this tree and let's take this for.

08:00.040 --> 08:00.260
Right.

08:00.430 --> 08:03.010
So one one again a number of ways.

08:03.700 --> 08:07.000
So right now, what I'm saying is the number of ways of.

08:08.390 --> 08:13.430
Ballooning the subtree of a leaf node they'd mutated.

08:14.870 --> 08:18.380
Right now I'm wondering about the number of is.

08:25.240 --> 08:25.960
Quality.

08:28.710 --> 08:29.670
Of giving.

08:31.710 --> 08:32.760
Proper colors.

08:38.700 --> 08:39.600
This subtree.

08:45.450 --> 08:47.340
Of X x can be any node.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.010
X is colored.

08:55.070 --> 08:56.480
Or by eight.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.630
So here represents to right now.

09:00.050 --> 09:08.090
But if I color two is black I've got one as a possibility because what is the subtree of to raise the

09:08.090 --> 09:09.860
subtree of to represent only two.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.250
Subtree of two does not have any other.

09:15.360 --> 09:15.750
No.

09:15.810 --> 09:16.180
Right.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.460
So this is a subtree of two.

09:17.750 --> 09:23.460
So the number of ways in which if it was black and white, the number of ways of coloring its subtree,

09:23.460 --> 09:29.820
its two number of ways if I color nor number two is white rather than number of ways of coloring it

09:29.820 --> 09:30.240
subtract.

09:30.240 --> 09:35.850
It is again one same four, three, same four, four eight guys because all of them are the lymph nodes.

09:36.390 --> 09:39.600
They are the only person they are the only player in this series.

09:39.930 --> 09:41.190
No one is eight.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.810
Then let's talk about this node and everything will become complete.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.090
Right?

09:44.610 --> 09:46.740
So let's talk about node number one.

09:47.040 --> 09:50.070
What are the number of ways of coloring?

09:50.070 --> 09:54.570
The whole subtree of one if I color one with black.

09:55.360 --> 09:59.110
Hey, if I color one with black, let's color this with black.

09:59.110 --> 10:01.020
Let's put some color black over there.

10:01.300 --> 10:09.520
I'm coloring it black if I color red, black cannot color this with white, but can I color nor number

10:09.520 --> 10:10.240
two with black?

10:10.780 --> 10:11.170
No.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.630
By the way, there will be a note.

10:14.050 --> 10:15.900
Can I go three with black?

10:16.270 --> 10:16.620
No.

10:16.990 --> 10:20.560
Otherwise there will be a dizziness side because one is already painted black.

10:20.890 --> 10:25.090
I cannot color any neighborhood of one will be black again.

10:25.540 --> 10:25.760
Eight.

10:25.930 --> 10:28.690
Similarly, guys, I cannot afford to be black.

10:28.780 --> 10:30.580
Now there is only one possibility.

10:30.580 --> 10:36.460
If I color one to be black, then I only have to color two to be white.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.550
Three to be white and four to be white.

10:40.410 --> 10:40.740
Eight.

10:42.040 --> 10:49.040
So now just look at the statement there, the number of ways of balloting, one as black.

10:49.680 --> 10:53.740
Eight If I'm calling one is black, then what are the number of ways of living?

10:53.740 --> 10:55.630
Whole subtree of one.

10:56.920 --> 11:02.710
What are the number of ways of coloring books arbitrary of one then I recursively regarded as like this

11:03.010 --> 11:09.040
it is equal to the if I independently color this subtree.

11:09.670 --> 11:15.360
If I a with two as of eight note, of course, if I independently colored the subtree with three as

11:15.370 --> 11:21.470
a wide note, and I independently carried this subtree with photos of the whatever, then number of

11:21.470 --> 11:27.010
ways, let's say there are some in number of ways to do subtree being, number of ways to color the

11:27.010 --> 11:33.340
subtree and see number of ways to collect this subtree and part of the total number of ways to color

11:33.340 --> 11:34.240
one as black.

11:35.710 --> 11:35.940
12.

11:36.040 --> 11:39.000
The whole subtree of one with one is black naught.

11:39.010 --> 11:46.420
It will be cool to aim to be in to see what Arabian Sea is and number of ways of coloring the subtree

11:46.420 --> 11:46.990
of two.

11:47.880 --> 11:53.940
Ventoux is coloured white, so the subtree of two can be any possibility that there are no to a dozen

11:53.940 --> 11:54.480
black nodes.

11:54.750 --> 11:56.160
That's what the answer contains.

11:57.380 --> 12:03.240
That's why I'm figuring out the answer for one every ounce of what its subtree, the subtree for answer

12:03.240 --> 12:05.710
one depends on its subtree loftily.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.020
So let me.

12:07.030 --> 12:07.950
It is this one's.

12:08.460 --> 12:12.060
I hope you got this by into being to see where it will be.

12:12.390 --> 12:13.850
How many of these theories.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.780
Because one into one.

12:15.780 --> 12:16.380
Into one.

12:16.650 --> 12:18.500
One was a number of ways of coloring your death.

12:18.660 --> 12:18.980
White.

12:19.710 --> 12:20.640
So do not worry, guys.

12:20.640 --> 12:24.330
I'll be taking answers with different would not answer them.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.060
Then we'll see how we are getting answers because.

12:28.770 --> 12:30.360
The structure of the tree will change.

12:31.390 --> 12:31.670
Eight.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.370
Let's talk about.

12:34.470 --> 12:35.670
A second ray of.

12:36.850 --> 12:37.120
Yeah.

12:37.450 --> 12:38.050
Now, what if I.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.040
Caliban is white?

12:40.130 --> 12:44.990
If I Colombian is white, what are the number of ways in which I can fulfill this whole clearing of

12:44.990 --> 12:45.350
the tree?

12:45.950 --> 12:48.200
All coloring of this subtree of one eight.

12:48.350 --> 12:52.310
So if I'm coloring one is white, is there any constraint on two, three or four?

12:53.270 --> 12:58.580
No rate if there are no constraints on two, three and four, that means I can read black or white,

12:58.760 --> 13:00.470
black or white, black or white.

13:00.920 --> 13:04.820
What are the total number of ways in which you color this arbitrary of two?

13:04.850 --> 13:10.460
If I'm coloring two as black already, it is one plus 1 to 8, whether it would be black or white.

13:10.800 --> 13:11.510
So two.

13:11.810 --> 13:13.970
Which is one plus one into.

13:15.230 --> 13:18.740
The number of bills for three, which is one plus one in two, one plus one.

13:18.970 --> 13:19.340
What are they?

13:19.400 --> 13:22.340
The number of is if I color one as a white node.

13:23.380 --> 13:26.920
But as of right now it is doing doo doo doo doo.

13:26.920 --> 13:27.940
Which is it?

13:29.420 --> 13:29.720
Right.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.000
So if I go 11 is why not?

13:32.270 --> 13:33.710
Then it is giving me it.

13:33.710 --> 13:38.050
And if I color is one is black note then what other to of the treat?

13:38.100 --> 13:40.850
It was for me it was only.

13:41.790 --> 13:44.670
But if I colored black, these have to be white.

13:44.680 --> 13:48.930
So what are the number of white into white into white eight.

13:49.170 --> 13:50.010
Which is white.

13:50.130 --> 13:54.090
And if I call it white, if I know number one to be white, then no.

13:54.090 --> 13:58.260
Number two, three and four, you can pick any yellow as a black or white.

13:58.260 --> 13:59.130
There is no question.

13:59.130 --> 14:03.420
So what are the number of ways of calling the whole subtree of two, irrespective of whatever we have

14:03.420 --> 14:04.830
found in the.

14:05.770 --> 14:06.490
Other subjects.

14:06.490 --> 14:08.170
We are not worrying about other subjects.

14:08.170 --> 14:09.860
I know this is important, right?

14:10.180 --> 14:17.380
No matter what, Ophelia doesn't affect it doesn't affect to audit subject it because these are independent

14:17.380 --> 14:23.890
from do because none of them are designed to do you or any node of those subtree eight.

14:25.080 --> 14:25.530
So.

14:25.890 --> 14:26.160
Yeah.

14:28.150 --> 14:29.800
So yeah, that was about it.

14:29.990 --> 14:32.770
And I hope you understood this part.

14:34.090 --> 14:39.190
VI is an answer for why we are leading on so far the whole subseries.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.430
Now, if I want to find dozens over the whole tree, that means I have to find the root note of the

14:43.430 --> 14:44.500
old green, which is one.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.770
So if I invited, it gives me eight possibilities.

14:47.770 --> 14:50.860
If I colored black, it gives me one possibility.

14:51.280 --> 14:51.580
Eight.

14:51.850 --> 14:52.110
But what?

14:52.180 --> 14:53.920
What are the total number of possibilities?

14:54.190 --> 14:55.660
We have nine possibilities.

14:55.730 --> 14:57.070
So we have nine as Don's.

14:58.020 --> 14:58.290
Well.

14:59.770 --> 15:02.250
Now let's take a call.

15:02.300 --> 15:09.010
Let's stick to our three or four gig, any of them as let's stick to whether or together and let's apply

15:09.010 --> 15:15.070
the same logic that we have discussed, which is so two is connected to one and one is connected to

15:15.070 --> 15:16.360
three and.

15:18.070 --> 15:18.340
Okay.

15:18.340 --> 15:18.910
We have four.

15:19.180 --> 15:19.390
Yeah.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.190
One is connected to four also.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.800
Well, let's start from the leaf, not let's start to build things up.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.050
What are the number of ways in which.

15:30.050 --> 15:31.430
I can gladly three or four.

15:32.480 --> 15:37.700
What are the number of ways of giving proper colors to the subtree of x if x is colored, black or white?

15:38.300 --> 15:43.850
If I colored three black, I live a number of ways and if a colored white I look by number of isn't

15:43.850 --> 15:50.760
seen for four because these are the lymph nodes eight by 514 leverage because I'm only considering about

15:50.760 --> 15:51.710
the subtree of three.

15:52.220 --> 15:54.680
Just imagine that I don't have the other tree.

15:54.680 --> 15:55.990
Only I have the subtree of tree.

15:56.000 --> 15:56.360
Nothing.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.530
It's eight.

15:58.730 --> 16:00.630
Well, now goes for one.

16:00.650 --> 16:02.270
What are the number of ways of coloring?

16:02.270 --> 16:03.080
One, two, four.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.840
One if I color one is black.

16:06.170 --> 16:10.130
And what are the number of ways of coloring the whole subtree over one eight.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.800
So if I call it black, then the ends would have no.

16:13.820 --> 16:15.590
No possibilities, no opportunities.

16:15.650 --> 16:18.170
Eight They have to be colored with white.

16:18.510 --> 16:19.940
What are the number of ways of killing them?

16:19.940 --> 16:22.280
By one end, 1 to 1 into one will give me one.

16:22.880 --> 16:23.060
Right.

16:23.420 --> 16:28.310
And of course, if I color one to be white, if I give it a white color, three can have another black

16:28.310 --> 16:30.740
or white, and four can have either black or white.

16:31.130 --> 16:36.320
So what's the answer for that whole subtree if I give them either black or white?

16:36.350 --> 16:38.810
So it is two for three the number of possibilities.

16:40.050 --> 16:41.400
One plus one and one plus one.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.410
We're just going to do, which is four.

16:43.590 --> 16:45.680
So this gets me for eight.

16:45.810 --> 16:46.920
Now let's talk about two.

16:48.290 --> 16:49.160
Finally eight.

16:49.530 --> 16:50.220
So what?

16:50.300 --> 16:54.950
So if I give to to be a blackfella, that means I have to give one to be a white colour.

16:54.950 --> 16:56.660
Then what are the number of ways of colouring?

16:56.660 --> 16:57.740
The whole subtree of one.

16:58.010 --> 16:59.810
If I'm giving one is a white colour.

16:59.930 --> 17:02.060
It is food which I've already calculated.

17:02.570 --> 17:02.870
Eight.

17:03.140 --> 17:07.350
So here I'll get four white because I've given black to two.

17:07.490 --> 17:09.760
And that means one has to take white.

17:09.770 --> 17:16.070
So and the number of ways in which one takes one takes white and the whole of this chapter is coloured

17:16.250 --> 17:17.120
is foot high.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.640
How am I getting four by these two numbers?

17:21.250 --> 17:21.550
Eight.

17:22.090 --> 17:23.340
Let me give you examples.

17:23.340 --> 17:24.610
So it is right for one.

17:25.540 --> 17:27.190
Black flag.

17:27.190 --> 17:28.180
For both of them.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.730
It can be white, white, black.

17:31.330 --> 17:32.500
It can be white.

17:33.650 --> 17:34.190
Black.

17:34.440 --> 17:34.880
White.

17:35.390 --> 17:36.560
Or it can be white.

17:37.100 --> 17:37.640
White.

17:38.210 --> 17:38.720
Quite so.

17:38.720 --> 17:39.980
There are four possibilities.

17:40.700 --> 17:41.560
I hope we're getting about.

17:41.570 --> 17:45.200
How am I getting these four possibilities right now?

17:45.380 --> 17:45.650
Yeah.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.990
No, it's color to to be white.

17:48.350 --> 17:50.660
So what if I give color to as a white color?

17:52.180 --> 17:58.390
If I'm giving it a white color, that means one can have either black colour or can have it a white

17:58.390 --> 17:58.610
color.

17:58.630 --> 17:59.800
So what are the possibilities?

17:59.800 --> 18:02.180
If one is a bit black colour, it is one less.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.210
What are the possibilities if one is a white colour?

18:04.360 --> 18:05.130
It can have four.

18:05.140 --> 18:06.340
So one plus for this five.

18:06.910 --> 18:09.910
If I'm wearing a vital, I get five to number of ways of.

18:12.020 --> 18:14.720
This whole subject has to exist in the black.

18:15.080 --> 18:23.800
And if I give black to NOR number two, then I have four possibilities to color this whole thing.

18:24.820 --> 18:29.830
In the given constraints, in the given requirements, what are the total number of ways I can add the

18:29.830 --> 18:32.440
goal to as one as black or white red.

18:32.710 --> 18:35.290
That means add that four or five.

18:35.290 --> 18:36.850
So we have total nine possibility.

18:38.310 --> 18:40.910
Well, because four for black, five for white.

18:40.980 --> 18:43.140
So you can take Angela four or five.

18:43.140 --> 18:46.290
And we have the whole answer for the deputy of two, which is the whole three.

18:46.890 --> 18:49.860
Again, guys, we can easily see we are getting nine here.

18:49.860 --> 18:50.730
Also, we got nine.

18:51.950 --> 18:52.280
Eight.

18:56.260 --> 19:02.460
Rude doesn't decide answer read the structure of the do decide Sansa salute can be any note of the tree.

19:02.500 --> 19:10.300
You can try the same solution for this big input by digging different different routes as well as a

19:10.300 --> 19:11.670
solution route the route.

19:12.280 --> 19:12.720
Now this.

19:12.730 --> 19:15.700
Let me quickly write the DB reconciliation that we have discussed.

19:16.390 --> 19:21.160
So here what I believe using I are using to dance which is current that means the current node in a

19:21.160 --> 19:25.300
DFS whenever we performed DFS and the next node is X.

19:26.310 --> 19:28.510
So let's not use X, let's use chained.

19:31.490 --> 19:35.000
It's sort of the siloed directory of any node industry.

19:35.390 --> 19:41.360
So here it was only one one surrealist tree and one surrealist four eight where two is up parent and

19:41.360 --> 19:41.600
over.

19:41.600 --> 19:48.070
And so this terminology should be very clear to you because it is kind of dynamic programming entry.

19:48.080 --> 19:53.960
So before understanding dynamic programming, you must know what is fees and what is definition and

19:53.960 --> 19:55.850
structure and melodies.

19:56.330 --> 20:01.750
They provide audiences the answer for some deep current zero or one.

20:01.790 --> 20:02.120
Right?

20:02.120 --> 20:04.720
So here will have two terms zero or one eight.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.490
So let me later D deep current.

20:07.910 --> 20:12.950
But what does zero represents let's say that presents black and what does one represent?

20:13.130 --> 20:19.580
Let's say it represents white DB Current zero means the total possibilities on.

20:19.850 --> 20:20.990
Let me copy this.

20:24.350 --> 20:25.430
The number of ways.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.200
In which.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.370
So let me repeat the total number of these.

20:34.350 --> 20:35.070
In which.

20:37.210 --> 20:37.870
Subtree.

20:38.180 --> 20:38.650
Okay.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.180
The subtree.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.570
Of current is painted.

20:52.950 --> 20:55.320
If current is.

20:57.450 --> 20:58.230
Painted black.

20:59.950 --> 21:00.280
Eight.

21:00.400 --> 21:04.390
And similarly, for one, if it is painted white, just the same definition.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.490
And what will be the reconciliation here?

21:06.970 --> 21:10.660
A deep current zero will depend on each side.

21:10.690 --> 21:16.210
Of course, we have seen there that if we are giving it a black colour, I cannot give it so black colour.

21:16.540 --> 21:17.680
It only depends on white.

21:18.120 --> 21:21.070
The depiction in zero is actually the multiplication.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.700
All child of parent.

21:26.320 --> 21:29.590
So a do notice I'm considering only change.

21:29.590 --> 21:31.060
I'm not considering parent over it.

21:31.060 --> 21:31.840
Only the change.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.280
This only the seventies.

21:33.970 --> 21:36.790
It is a multiplication of the current one.

21:36.880 --> 21:44.320
So the child, when not getting late, that means the number of be them giving it sole alert one and

21:44.470 --> 21:46.360
tell me what are the number of years of this subjects?

21:46.360 --> 21:48.910
I simply multiply them because they're independent of each other.

21:49.570 --> 21:51.990
And simply what is the current one?

21:52.060 --> 21:53.760
That means if I'm giving your divide color.

21:54.840 --> 22:00.270
If I'm wearing a white collar that the child can take any of the forms, black or white.

22:00.870 --> 22:04.900
That means it should be equal to the sum, the multiplication of other.

22:04.950 --> 22:08.310
The child is printed one that means white or the child is printed.

22:11.890 --> 22:13.810
Multiplication of all the chains.

22:14.110 --> 22:14.410
Eight.

22:15.190 --> 22:18.530
So this is a normal examination that will define what are the best guesses.

22:18.550 --> 22:19.660
It's a leap, not.

22:21.710 --> 22:25.700
That means rip current zero is equal to the current one.

22:27.260 --> 22:28.430
Is equal to one.

22:28.760 --> 22:34.190
Because if I'm bringing your black number of this one, if I'm bringing your inviting tomorrow with

22:34.190 --> 22:36.910
one because it contains it's only subseries.

22:38.420 --> 22:41.510
So in the next, I will call it out.

22:41.750 --> 22:42.350
Thank you, guys.
