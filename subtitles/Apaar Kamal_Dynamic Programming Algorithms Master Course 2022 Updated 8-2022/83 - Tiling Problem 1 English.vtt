00:00.920 --> 00:03.020
Everyone, welcome to the tiling problem.

00:03.800 --> 00:08.150
Who some of you might have heard about it and most of you might have solved it as well.

00:08.150 --> 00:08.450
Right?

00:09.530 --> 00:16.670
What I would suggest is that, okay, if you have all this tiling problem, then you might skip this

00:16.670 --> 00:16.970
part.

00:16.970 --> 00:20.990
But there is a next video which is a follow up of the Italian problem.

00:21.320 --> 00:27.980
And after that I have another one which is a be follow a follow up of detailing problem data.

00:28.820 --> 00:34.520
You can you might skip this because it's the basic problem this one but do not skip the next and next

00:34.520 --> 00:39.950
28 because that will help you solve various versions of tiling problem.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.140
Let's understand this.

00:43.480 --> 00:50.110
Given it to growth and bought here we can see two across and is two tenure and tiles of sales across

00:50.110 --> 00:50.350
one.

00:51.370 --> 00:52.710
So we can see details.

00:53.050 --> 00:59.350
So basically this is two across one and this is one close to eight out in the middle based tile, the

00:59.350 --> 01:01.000
given word using two cross when tiles.

01:01.180 --> 01:07.150
So this is two grosman tiles are that you can replace horizontally vertically ever tile basically it's

01:07.150 --> 01:10.240
called a dominoes or dominoes is a rectangle in short.

01:10.600 --> 01:17.710
And I have to play it these days and I tell you the number of ways I can fill this across ten board

01:18.070 --> 01:21.190
with these dates, the number the different number of is eight.

01:21.880 --> 01:22.150
So.

01:23.590 --> 01:26.500
Let's understand this and it's very nice problem.

01:26.530 --> 01:29.410
I mean, if you get this, you solve the next one.

01:29.410 --> 01:31.660
You alter right to solve the next next problem.

01:32.170 --> 01:35.980
And then I will give you two other problems that you should short and.

01:36.930 --> 01:42.570
And I think that those two other problems might even a couple of days but eight.

01:43.290 --> 01:44.430
Yeah it's the dive.

01:44.520 --> 01:44.820
Do it.

01:46.180 --> 01:47.620
Who goes in Italy.

01:47.650 --> 01:48.160
Let's see.

01:49.090 --> 01:54.400
Let's write in posted, which is often what is often a fan is the number of is.

01:57.450 --> 01:57.930
Who died.

02:01.690 --> 02:02.380
To cross in.

02:03.460 --> 02:06.100
But with the times that I live in doing.

02:07.700 --> 02:08.970
A bit.

02:10.210 --> 02:11.560
Two crossword puzzles.

02:13.360 --> 02:13.660
Well.

02:14.230 --> 02:17.980
So what we we'll do is see in every tiling problem will do just one thing.

02:18.340 --> 02:23.020
We will try to fill one column of it and then derive a revelation.

02:23.050 --> 02:24.100
Just remember this part.

02:24.610 --> 02:31.120
I'm not only talking about this problem, but every problem after this and will see the trick that is

02:31.120 --> 02:36.310
involved here, which will ease which will help me in solving this problem.

02:37.150 --> 02:37.810
So basically.

02:38.780 --> 02:41.680
Let's just fill one column, the first column, eight.

02:42.140 --> 02:44.570
But in how many ways can I fill the first column?

02:44.570 --> 02:45.200
Completely.

02:45.770 --> 02:46.880
So let's fill the first column.

02:47.240 --> 02:51.050
The first base symbol that I used to cross one day.

02:51.470 --> 02:51.980
And.

02:56.160 --> 02:56.660
Ladies.

02:56.730 --> 02:58.620
This can be the first to be read.

02:58.950 --> 03:00.060
So if.

03:01.750 --> 03:02.010
Yeah.

03:02.020 --> 03:02.980
Look, we don't want this.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.430
Listen very carefully, Ray.

03:06.930 --> 03:07.860
This is important now.

03:09.280 --> 03:09.500
Hmm.

03:10.380 --> 03:15.290
So if this was the number of ways in which I could have filled.

03:17.520 --> 03:23.550
If this was effen and if I'm applying if I'm filling just one column by this method.

03:24.690 --> 03:26.850
And what should this be?

03:27.600 --> 03:31.200
This is f of an minus one rate because I filled up one column.

03:31.230 --> 03:36.780
I'm just asking, tell me how many number of eyes are there to fill the and minus one columns.

03:37.140 --> 03:37.350
Eight.

03:37.530 --> 03:38.730
So basically even.

03:42.010 --> 03:47.020
Because two, even minus one right now, eight plus there would be something and then we'll discuss.

03:47.360 --> 03:47.570
Okay.

03:47.590 --> 03:49.450
So this is the first.

03:50.370 --> 03:52.020
I think this is the first thing.

03:52.020 --> 03:52.680
The first step.

03:53.340 --> 03:58.080
The second step is right now, I feel I place detailed vertically.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.740
I place one tile vertically and it's the first column.

04:02.130 --> 04:03.510
Now in how many?

04:03.960 --> 04:07.710
Now, what are the other ways in which I can fill the first column?

04:07.740 --> 04:09.090
What are the different ways you.

04:10.420 --> 04:10.990
Think about it.

04:12.020 --> 04:12.800
LICHTMAN This.

04:14.080 --> 04:14.920
Also I can.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.530
Place the tiles horizontally.

04:18.020 --> 04:20.750
If I place one data horizontally, it becomes this.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.570
But as you can see, the first column is not completely filled.

04:25.570 --> 04:28.360
So I will place a second time in this.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.510
Manner to basically place two days over here.

04:33.350 --> 04:38.480
So as you can see, it is quite different from the first approach in the first place.

04:38.480 --> 04:43.820
When Dale and I was I was asking, tell me the number of views to fill in minus one.

04:45.480 --> 04:50.070
But now here I have pleased that in a different manner I placed two tiles horizontally.

04:50.550 --> 04:53.600
Don't confuse it with placing two tiles vertically.

04:53.610 --> 04:53.940
Right.

04:53.970 --> 04:55.680
So these are the different ways.

04:56.580 --> 04:57.660
What it two grows to.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.310
Let's say I just have to cross two.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.550
There are two ways of placing it.

05:01.560 --> 05:06.780
That means there's two days like this or place to tiles horizontally.

05:07.590 --> 05:08.910
Both of them are different ways.

05:08.910 --> 05:09.160
Right?

05:09.160 --> 05:10.290
So this is different from.

05:11.140 --> 05:11.500
This.

05:12.460 --> 05:13.360
Do not get confused.

05:14.470 --> 05:17.980
So always remember, I'm just talking about how to fill up the first column.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.880
And if second column fills up automatically, it's not my head.

05:22.180 --> 05:25.690
I'm just trying to fill up the first column in some different number of ways.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.890
I just remember this, but this is a second way of filling the first column.

05:31.050 --> 05:32.260
So what I get in this.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.340
This is the second approach by placing two trains horizontally.

05:37.550 --> 05:40.130
So the first approach was one tail vertically.

05:41.570 --> 05:43.130
The first column was completely different.

05:43.280 --> 05:43.600
Right.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.320
And the second approach is.

05:46.340 --> 05:47.720
You dial horizontally.

05:52.160 --> 05:52.420
Great.

05:52.700 --> 05:57.020
And now tell me if this is as a fan, then what is?

05:59.580 --> 06:00.060
This.

06:01.120 --> 06:05.920
The number of ways of filling the rest of the rest of the columns.

06:06.940 --> 06:07.810
How many columns are there?

06:07.810 --> 06:10.340
And my answer to this are different minus eight.

06:10.780 --> 06:15.160
So let me just quickly add F when it comes to F and this one minus two.

06:15.550 --> 06:15.820
Right.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.480
So I've seen both these two, is it not?

06:19.480 --> 06:19.990
Tell me.

06:21.510 --> 06:24.210
Is there any other way in which I can fill the first column?

06:24.210 --> 06:24.450
No.

06:25.940 --> 06:28.010
I've tried hitting horizontally.

06:28.010 --> 06:29.600
I tried placing vertically.

06:30.020 --> 06:33.040
Is there any other ways in which naught eight?

06:33.170 --> 06:35.180
I cannot think of any, but basically.

06:36.690 --> 06:37.950
I got America's religion.

06:38.220 --> 06:43.500
And as I said, this would be a very easy approach, very easy problem.

06:43.810 --> 06:45.950
It is simple if only goes to F in minus one.

06:46.350 --> 06:49.530
Because if in my house to which is none other than for when it is.

06:50.690 --> 06:50.960
It.

06:51.220 --> 06:55.130
We basically hit a400 or four one.

06:56.430 --> 06:59.190
The number of ways in which I can fill this.

06:59.550 --> 07:00.030
Only one.

07:01.010 --> 07:04.450
It is one by placing one then vertically f2.

07:04.460 --> 07:05.150
What is F2?

07:05.180 --> 07:06.350
I have seen both the ways.

07:06.350 --> 07:08.810
The both ways are this, this and this.

07:09.790 --> 07:10.330
This is.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.070
To eight.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.080
And now what?

07:15.090 --> 07:15.390
Three.

07:15.460 --> 07:16.330
What will it be?

07:16.750 --> 07:18.340
It will be nothing but f and deserve to.

07:18.340 --> 07:19.920
Which is the right.

07:20.560 --> 07:24.120
So do you want me to make all the trimmings?

07:25.120 --> 07:25.990
It's very easy, right?

07:27.400 --> 07:28.120
11.

07:28.330 --> 07:31.810
How did I feel when I simplify living like this?

07:31.810 --> 07:34.060
By placing one day less.

07:34.900 --> 07:37.270
I'll add oodles like this.

07:37.660 --> 07:38.470
This is what we doing.

07:38.860 --> 07:41.500
And the second way is how do they.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.450
What are the two ways of feeling F2?

07:44.260 --> 07:48.970
So this was one way and this was the second way in which I placed two columns.

07:48.970 --> 07:53.080
I filled up two columns, eight and after didn't simply apply one thing.

07:55.320 --> 07:55.500
Here.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.960
You can see, I mean, all three possible ways of filling.

07:59.030 --> 08:02.140
Regrowth in grass treated.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.160
Who goes to grow up to Christ.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.280
Three Bored and we have got this what is that?

08:08.280 --> 08:16.080
445 And you can like make all the possible variation, let's remember the quick to big because in the

08:16.080 --> 08:18.720
next problem it is going to help you in the next to next problem.

08:19.110 --> 08:21.120
It is going to help you a lot actually.

08:21.360 --> 08:25.680
It's very confusing problem and it might give you a headache as I so.

08:26.730 --> 08:27.830
This is a very easy problem.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.400
This is a basic function of tackling problem.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.680
I hope you understood this.

08:30.690 --> 08:34.270
I'm not cutting this because legislation is very simple.

08:35.250 --> 08:35.490
Well.

08:36.420 --> 08:37.080
Thank you, everyone.

08:37.220 --> 08:37.830
In the next part.
