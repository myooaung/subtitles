00:00.840 --> 00:05.100
Everyone, let's find the longest in reading sequence of the series.

00:05.970 --> 00:07.560
This is a simple error.

00:07.560 --> 00:14.190
And number two random words to find what is the longest increasing sequence in this page?

00:14.670 --> 00:21.020
Of course, it's the dynamic programming course and will be using the in this or just think like positively

00:21.030 --> 00:26.010
and think about it by of course by learning something from the above examples.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.480
It's very similar to this problem and it's it's also very similar to this problem and it's also very

00:33.480 --> 00:36.390
similar to this problem that we have all discussed.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.950
It's only about making connections.

00:39.360 --> 00:42.240
It's about thinking one step back.

00:43.410 --> 00:43.650
Right.

00:44.380 --> 00:45.780
So, yeah.

00:45.930 --> 00:47.130
So what are the longest increasing?

00:47.150 --> 00:52.050
As we all know, so many sequences are possible for this array so we can see that it's learned this

00:52.050 --> 00:52.410
drill.

00:52.860 --> 00:56.610
So there are two to the power sequences minus one.

00:56.640 --> 01:04.530
If I remove the empty one and these many sequences are possible and so there will be again seven sequences

01:04.530 --> 01:08.910
of length one and to do with this relative to for length two and so on.

01:09.360 --> 01:15.390
But what I have to do is out of all these sequences, I have to find F to find the length of longest

01:15.390 --> 01:16.200
in creating sequence.

01:16.860 --> 01:21.180
If I'm able to find the length of longest in creating sequence, I will also be able to find.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.100
This sequence, right?

01:23.120 --> 01:29.460
I was I always told you whenever you applied and programming and filled some states, that particular

01:29.460 --> 01:32.800
state, which is the final answer, is actually coming from some previous state.

01:32.800 --> 01:33.080
Right.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.820
Which is also coming from some previous state and so on.

01:36.450 --> 01:40.050
So we can always respected and we programming coalition always.

01:42.180 --> 01:42.420
Yeah.

01:42.600 --> 01:47.250
So in this also, we saw that we we were we were able to trace back the answers because every state

01:47.250 --> 01:52.620
comes from some other state and we just have to trace back the origin of the final state.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.160
Well, yeah.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.320
So let's understand this.

01:58.940 --> 02:01.300
So initially what we'll do is we'll make a state.

02:02.110 --> 02:03.220
So we'll make a state.

02:03.640 --> 02:10.510
And I've already told you this point, I always start from one end is a basket, then add some more,

02:11.230 --> 02:13.000
then add some more, then add some more.

02:13.090 --> 02:18.940
So on the backward induction method, it will help you reach to the recursive solution.

02:20.500 --> 02:20.770
So.

02:21.700 --> 02:21.860
Yeah.

02:22.030 --> 02:22.750
Let's make us two.

02:22.780 --> 02:25.140
Let's say FAA or ethics eight.

02:25.570 --> 02:28.090
What else is a layers of.

02:29.470 --> 02:30.130
A sequence.

02:32.680 --> 02:33.460
Let's lend.

02:34.380 --> 02:35.460
Land of is.

02:37.220 --> 02:37.960
Okay, fine.

02:38.900 --> 02:42.710
Her longest increasing sequence means the number only the land on the right.

02:42.980 --> 02:44.540
Don't think it's the sequence.

02:44.570 --> 02:45.350
It's a number.

02:45.890 --> 02:47.780
What is the length of the longest increasing sequence?

02:48.280 --> 02:48.470
It's.

02:48.530 --> 02:48.980
I'm just saying.

02:49.130 --> 02:51.110
Is that a yes of this sequence?

02:51.590 --> 02:51.950
If.

02:53.150 --> 02:53.750
You don't one.

02:56.430 --> 02:57.270
And Son, I.

02:59.890 --> 03:00.250
Okay.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.140
So, um, yeah.

03:02.140 --> 03:07.420
So once I was teaching this to some student and he asked me this, doubt it.

03:07.750 --> 03:09.610
Why don't we sort it out?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.240
If we started, we'll get the longest increasing sequence.

03:14.530 --> 03:19.030
Well, that's not the solution paid by because we cannot support it.

03:19.030 --> 03:20.330
We cannot change the order.

03:20.350 --> 03:25.150
If I change the order of this sequence, it won't be it won't be a sequence anymore.

03:25.870 --> 03:34.090
For example, let's see if I take this seven, eight, 44, eight, and here seven, eight and 44 is

03:34.090 --> 03:35.190
an increasing sequence.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.820
It may or may not be longest, including sequence, but it's an increasing sequence.

03:39.280 --> 03:43.630
I cannot change the order in which I have to pick up the sequences.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.030
I cannot change the order of the number.

03:46.030 --> 03:52.360
If seven comes before eight in the original sequence, it will come before ordered in the increasing

03:52.360 --> 03:53.230
subsequent as a.

03:54.840 --> 03:55.020
So.

03:56.280 --> 03:56.550
Okay.

03:56.550 --> 03:58.470
Let me like quickly rephrase it.

03:59.070 --> 04:04.590
It can also be said longest increasing subsequent rate by subsequent gains because.

04:06.770 --> 04:10.590
We need to maintain the property in the order of the value later.

04:10.610 --> 04:11.870
Don't get confused from date.

04:13.610 --> 04:13.950
Yeah.

04:13.970 --> 04:17.300
So we cannot sort it in final and otherwise it will always be done.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.790
So will always be equal to the length of the original sequence.

04:20.240 --> 04:23.450
Because if I started, every sequence can be the longest, including sequence.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.080
But we don't want it.

04:25.570 --> 04:28.680
We'll just remove it from what we might.

04:29.490 --> 04:33.140
And I guess of a sequence if it ends on X or date.

04:33.240 --> 04:37.200
So yeah, there's always some confusion between our Unix in my mind of.

04:39.710 --> 04:44.300
That means if it ends on the next index looks at index.

04:44.300 --> 04:48.380
So hit X's index eight, it's called X's index eight.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.480
Now let me index it quickly.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.010
Zero one, two, three, four.

04:55.810 --> 04:58.470
Let's start from the left side, which is the backward indication.

04:58.740 --> 05:05.100
Let's say my ad is only this one and it's 730, the length of the longest increasing sequence that is

05:05.100 --> 05:05.580
on seven.

05:05.580 --> 05:06.540
That ends on seven.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.890
It's only one rate.

05:08.130 --> 05:11.640
That means land will be won by because its only one number.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.440
Length is only one eight.

05:13.710 --> 05:14.340
Now let's.

05:14.610 --> 05:15.060
Come on.

05:15.570 --> 05:16.110
49.

05:16.950 --> 05:20.990
What will be the length of the longest in sequence if it ends on 49?

05:21.600 --> 05:25.470
If you remember what we always say, if something is ending on some.

05:27.020 --> 05:35.240
If a particular sequence is ending on 49, then there has to be a second end of the second, after which

05:35.540 --> 05:37.820
I'll try to apply 49 eight.

05:38.030 --> 05:41.090
So as we know, it is the longest increasing sequence of 49.

05:41.720 --> 05:47.660
If 49 comes after some other ending, let's say there was some ending before 49 and now I want to apply

05:47.660 --> 05:48.590
49 after it.

05:49.070 --> 05:51.200
Then what should that ending contain?

05:51.740 --> 05:57.320
That ending the number, that ending should be less than equal to 49 eight.

05:57.660 --> 06:03.350
So if I want to provide something to a particular ending, of course I want if I want to append, why

06:03.350 --> 06:03.650
do it?

06:04.340 --> 06:06.860
That means that X should be less than equal to it.

06:07.190 --> 06:08.900
Again, can I apply?

06:10.230 --> 06:14.920
Can I say that the longest ingredient sequence of our training can we do?

06:15.250 --> 06:19.540
Because it will come off to seven, it can come off to seven or eight.

06:19.810 --> 06:25.330
But if I have this area, that means seven and 14 and can make the longest ingredient sequence eight.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.590
Let me quickly.

06:28.400 --> 06:28.910
I do.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.390
I hope you understood why I have this, too, because now I can come up to seven.

06:32.390 --> 06:33.800
So basically this transition.

06:34.610 --> 06:35.330
7 to 14.

06:36.540 --> 06:37.270
Well what?

06:37.530 --> 06:41.370
So the best ending to the ending of the sequence was ending on seven.

06:41.880 --> 06:45.900
The best ending was one ride, and after that I applied for the name.

06:45.940 --> 06:47.320
Now let's talk about 23.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.390
This is a good case.

06:49.410 --> 06:54.150
Tell me and 23 transition after 14.

06:54.150 --> 06:58.020
And can can this be a sequence like 49 and then 23?

06:58.140 --> 06:58.440
No.

06:58.440 --> 06:58.670
Right.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.150
I want an increasing sequence.

07:00.150 --> 07:02.460
The previous number should be less than the current number.

07:02.460 --> 07:03.360
Less than or equal to.

07:04.350 --> 07:05.770
Look, can I make this transition?

07:06.270 --> 07:08.040
Yes, I again.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.140
What was the best ending on seven?

07:11.040 --> 07:11.730
That's my answer.

07:11.770 --> 07:14.310
The longest increase in sequence of the previous edit.

07:14.310 --> 07:16.740
If it ended on seven and it's kept here.

07:16.740 --> 07:19.290
This is the fixed values, all the deep values that I'm storing.

07:21.160 --> 07:25.270
What what was the length of the longest ingredient sequence which ended on seven?

07:25.630 --> 07:26.350
This one.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.480
What will be the answer for the current one?

07:29.440 --> 07:33.490
423 it will come after seven, seven plus one, which is two.

07:34.150 --> 07:35.230
I hope you got this right.

07:36.070 --> 07:41.380
If I sequence and search 23 for this area, then the longest including sequence is to.

07:42.430 --> 07:44.580
Well, I hope you're getting this now.

07:44.590 --> 07:50.080
Now it's only about making one transition, but we lose make one transition at a time.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.910
And finally, it will give us the whole answer.

07:52.450 --> 07:53.860
The step was being applied.

07:53.860 --> 07:55.690
Here we are making one transition at a time.

07:56.020 --> 07:59.210
We were looking at our one, one particular jump.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.120
We never said, I'll make two jumps.

08:01.120 --> 08:01.450
Right?

08:01.540 --> 08:08.410
So you might remember that when I want you to calculate it, I'll just go back once, go back once or

08:08.410 --> 08:09.120
go backwards.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.930
There's only one transition from it.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.170
I'm not saying I go back to seven and then to six.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.540
No, I'm not saying I'll go to seven and then do four.

08:16.780 --> 08:17.700
No, eight.

08:17.890 --> 08:20.980
It's always about making one transition at 38.

08:21.340 --> 08:24.730
If I take one step at a time, it will finally give me the whole answer.

08:25.180 --> 08:26.740
Eight Similarly, similarly in this.

08:27.990 --> 08:28.230
Yeah.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.720
Let's talk about it.

08:31.880 --> 08:32.120
So.

08:34.020 --> 08:36.180
So can it come after seven years?

08:36.210 --> 08:37.450
Can it come after 49?

08:37.470 --> 08:37.860
No.

08:37.890 --> 08:39.690
Can it come after 23?

08:39.900 --> 08:40.500
Basically.

08:40.860 --> 08:42.750
Again, 49 and 23 support it.

08:43.860 --> 08:46.880
Can they included in their sequence nor date?

08:46.920 --> 08:52.170
If they cannot include them in this sequence, then we can't use their maximum endings.

08:53.130 --> 08:54.420
What we'll do is we'll just.

08:55.820 --> 08:58.070
Use this maximum ending of seven.

09:00.220 --> 09:05.740
And this transition is it so basically one plus one again to will now be of us kids which is 30.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.390
Let's talk about today.

09:08.780 --> 09:09.530
Nothing goes.

09:10.860 --> 09:16.580
But they can come after seven because seven is less than 30 can come after 23.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.510
It can also come after it.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.010
Tell me.

09:21.160 --> 09:26.860
What's your to do to have to find the longest increasing sequence the party should think about which

09:26.860 --> 09:29.070
of these numbers is giving its best ending?

09:29.580 --> 09:29.740
Eight.

09:30.160 --> 09:35.440
So if seven seven is giving in one, 23 is giving him two and it is giving him two.

09:35.920 --> 09:41.320
If seven gives 27 gives one and all these gifts two, then of course, 30 will go with.

09:42.270 --> 09:42.770
To write.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.420
It can ever come after it.

09:44.660 --> 09:47.030
It can ever come up to 23.

09:47.360 --> 09:54.320
I we are getting this because both of them are giving the best possible ending for today, which is

09:54.320 --> 09:57.950
to basically what will the venue for today will be two plus one.

09:58.850 --> 10:05.330
I regard this so it doesn't matter whether it comes from 23 or it indirectly this this.

10:07.060 --> 10:09.950
It or it can be this it's.

10:10.030 --> 10:16.270
I'm just making some previous transitions and we are getting this one level thing about two transitions.

10:16.420 --> 10:23.050
Like previous and previous, no listing one previous because that previous is already taught about its

10:23.050 --> 10:24.400
previous age.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.680
Or similarly, it's all going to the beginning.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.960
It's about one step at a time.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.890
Well, now let's understand this.

10:33.040 --> 10:33.700
22.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.410
So what all values?

10:35.420 --> 10:36.280
1122.

10:36.520 --> 10:40.080
We can see seven and eight, which is giving it a best ending.

10:41.100 --> 10:44.460
It is giving it the best ending because of the store value rate.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.040
So it would 23, so 22 would most likely upend up to it.

10:50.610 --> 10:52.170
It will be three in this case.

10:52.690 --> 10:54.810
I'm just feeling up some deep values now.

10:55.650 --> 10:58.080
I'm just trying to make you realize how is it working?

10:58.080 --> 10:59.700
By making some previous transitions and.

11:01.540 --> 11:02.090
Whatever.

11:03.220 --> 11:08.680
So if I want to end on 44, then here I can see in except 49.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.970
All of them can give an ending to 44.

11:11.650 --> 11:14.530
Is the best ending that 444 can get.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.960
You can get the best ending from 30.

11:16.990 --> 11:20.530
You can also get the best ending from 22 eight.

11:21.040 --> 11:21.240
So.

11:23.260 --> 11:25.030
So we are just worried about the land trade.

11:25.030 --> 11:25.990
We are not worried about.

11:27.660 --> 11:28.740
What should be the sector?

11:28.980 --> 11:35.550
What should be the options in finding all the options that will come in the coming election where we

11:35.550 --> 11:38.100
are just worried about this, which is.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.040
Yeah.

11:40.230 --> 11:41.680
So this is a follow up question.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.410
I would want you to try this follow up question is very simple.

11:45.860 --> 11:50.600
I note the number of longest increasing sequences I am noticing.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.150
The length of longest English sequences, the number.

11:54.290 --> 12:00.140
How many how many ways in which I can find it and find the longest increasing sequence in this area.

12:00.980 --> 12:06.080
Just just try this by yourself, because we'll also see this again in the comment section.

12:06.960 --> 12:15.210
Well so yeah love about 44 it can be forward because any three plus one and now let's talk about 28

12:15.750 --> 12:19.850
it can come after seven or eight or 22 as well.

12:19.860 --> 12:22.950
So I think 22 will give it the best ending.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.200
So a three plus one is four.

12:24.360 --> 12:30.150
Similarly for 23, again, I think 22 can give it the best ending rate again before.

12:30.150 --> 12:33.120
So I we are getting this by four because it comes after 22.

12:33.630 --> 12:35.070
This 22 came after it.

12:36.180 --> 12:37.440
They say it came after seven.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.030
It's four eight.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.950
So this is a sequence that I'm trying to form.

12:42.000 --> 12:42.220
It.

12:42.450 --> 12:42.720
Yeah.

12:42.900 --> 12:43.560
It's one word.

12:44.340 --> 12:44.730
Nine.

12:45.360 --> 12:45.690
Nice.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.370
The nine can come up to seven or eight.

12:47.460 --> 12:48.150
Of course it should.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.900
It will better it appends after it.

12:51.270 --> 12:56.970
It uses it because it gives it a better ending, which is to rates are two plus one is three and 440.

12:57.570 --> 12:58.830
What I can see is.

13:00.120 --> 13:00.390
Hmm.

13:00.810 --> 13:01.180
Okay.

13:01.260 --> 13:01.890
So 40.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.410
So here we have the best ending.

13:04.080 --> 13:04.620
Three fourths.

13:04.620 --> 13:07.470
And I can't use 44 because of 40.

13:07.890 --> 13:10.890
I can use 28 and I can use any eight.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.040
Basically, 40 will have five in my.

13:18.180 --> 13:21.150
L.A. is value eight because it can come up with 28 or 23.

13:21.420 --> 13:27.720
Now the last one is 15 over 15 can come after nine, of course, but it cannot come after a forward

13:27.720 --> 13:28.900
23 years.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.110
It can come after it also after seven.

13:31.590 --> 13:34.200
Which of these three is giving the best ending to 15?

13:34.980 --> 13:36.680
Nine is giving the best ending to 15.

13:36.690 --> 13:37.800
So basically it will be four.

13:38.550 --> 13:42.060
I have taken 15 in this example for a specific reason.

13:42.510 --> 13:42.710
Eight.

13:43.080 --> 13:47.220
It doesn't mean that the last index will have the best answer.

13:47.640 --> 13:47.900
Eight.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.980
The longest increasing sequence does not have to end on the last index.

13:53.010 --> 13:54.120
I hope this is very clear.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.520
We've only also seen this in previous.

13:57.730 --> 13:58.720
Examples as well.

13:59.290 --> 14:00.100
Not necessarily.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.520
That last index will always have the final answer.

14:02.530 --> 14:05.740
Right, because it only tells us if 15 is included.

14:05.740 --> 14:06.820
And what's the best answer?

14:07.450 --> 14:10.870
But what if 15 is not the part of the longest increasing sequence?

14:11.530 --> 14:11.760
Right.

14:12.010 --> 14:15.160
So here what I can see is the maximum values, right?

14:15.490 --> 14:23.200
That means the 11 by 40, which is indirectly found by 23, which is indirectly found by 22, which

14:23.200 --> 14:26.770
is indirectly followed by eight and which is entirely followed by seven.

14:27.670 --> 14:30.970
This is the longest in creating sequence of this particular area.

14:32.950 --> 14:33.910
I hope you caught this.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.390
I said, How is this five value coming here?

14:38.600 --> 14:42.380
Well, but this was about longer singing and sequins in the next video recorded.

14:42.740 --> 14:44.420
And see the complexity of this.

14:44.570 --> 14:46.550
And then we'll try to optimize the complexity.

14:47.420 --> 14:52.190
But this is one dynamic work wrap programming approach of longest ingredient sequence or data that the

14:52.370 --> 14:54.860
but will also discuss that later in the.

14:55.830 --> 14:56.220
Thank you.
