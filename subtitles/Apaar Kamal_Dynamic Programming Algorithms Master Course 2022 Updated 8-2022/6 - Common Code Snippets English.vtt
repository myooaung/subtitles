00:00.580 --> 00:00.880
Okay.

1
00:00.890 --> 00:05.110
So in this tutorial, we'll be learning about how to make sublime snippets.

2
00:06.310 --> 00:09.100
But first of all, what I need to do is to make a good sublime snippet

3
00:09.550 --> 00:16.150
And let me tell you what a snippet is what will a snippet do just when you just like let's say you press

4
00:16.150 --> 00:21.250
some four buttons and the like, some a key, a trigger key in sublime.

5
00:21.580 --> 00:24.730
Then you'll get the whole code just by pressing some keys.

6
00:25.060 --> 00:33.130
What it is, it is actually mapping a key from a keyboard or a set of keys or a string to a particular

7
00:33.370 --> 00:34.210
code that I want.

8
00:34.280 --> 00:34.650
Right.

9
00:34.660 --> 00:41.980
So what happens is, let's say I quickly coded a question and then I want to put the next question.

10
00:42.160 --> 00:42.370
Right.

11
00:42.400 --> 00:46.330
So what I'll do is I'll simply erase everything and open my.

12
00:48.120 --> 00:48.750
new snippet.

13
00:48.750 --> 00:49.010
Right.

14
00:49.020 --> 00:51.030
So this works as my new snippet guys.

15
00:51.630 --> 00:54.840
So I guess everyone is very familiar with this.

16
00:54.840 --> 01:03.300
So it's very easy guys this new snippet and there isn't much to do whenever I want to start, when I

17
01:03.300 --> 01:05.280
want to code  a particular problem.

18
01:05.880 --> 01:09.000
This is a header file which contains all the other header files.

19
01:09.480 --> 01:12.540
This is a pretty standard stuff int main.

20
01:12.540 --> 01:14.670
And finally, ifndef online judge.

21
01:14.970 --> 01:18.630
So this is my setup right, a normal CP setup.

22
01:18.960 --> 01:21.110
Of course I can use int,  long long int.

23
01:21.120 --> 01:23.820
I can define other things that we'll be discussing in the next part.

24
01:24.450 --> 01:29.850
But before that, let's make a snippet of this so that whenever I press some keys, I get this whole

25
01:29.850 --> 01:30.720
code in front of me.

26
01:31.050 --> 01:31.210
Right.

27
01:31.250 --> 01:31.530
So.

28
01:32.650 --> 01:33.430
Let's select it.

29
01:33.550 --> 01:34.480
Let's copy this.

30
01:35.170 --> 01:41.590
And after copying this, what I'll do is I like go to tools right here in tools, we can see there's

31
01:41.590 --> 01:43.980
a new option called developer in developer.

32
01:44.260 --> 01:45.400
I'll go to new snippet.

33
01:46.450 --> 01:46.690
cool!

34
01:47.110 --> 01:52.000
So this is the window we'll get in the snippet part so guys what happens is whatever I copy.

35
01:52.330 --> 01:53.860
I simply select this line.

36
01:54.160 --> 01:59.020
Hello is a something line before I'm down.

37
01:59.030 --> 02:04.240
content at line three at line four and the content at line two.

38
02:04.240 --> 02:06.940
I'll select this whole line on line number three.

39
02:06.940 --> 02:11.170
I'll simply paste it, right,  whatever I selected whole code.

40
02:11.170 --> 02:15.490
I simply paste it the snippet off which I want and I simply uncomment.

41
02:15.490 --> 02:20.500
This tab trigger by pressing command and slash or what you can do is  you can simply remove

42
02:20.500 --> 02:20.890
this to.

43
02:23.600 --> 02:23.900
Right.

44
02:24.570 --> 02:28.200
And so right now default tab trigger is hello.

45
02:28.200 --> 02:31.680
So if I press hello I get this whole code but I don't want to press.

46
02:31.680 --> 02:31.980
Hello.

47
02:32.250 --> 02:34.410
What I would say is I would simply press let's

48
02:34.410 --> 02:36.180
say cpsimple

49
02:37.510 --> 02:37.780
cool.

50
02:38.550 --> 02:39.030
So.

51
02:40.380 --> 02:41.550
cpsimple is my.

52
02:43.020 --> 02:44.650
keyword.

53
02:44.730 --> 02:45.000
A tab trigger.

54
02:45.360 --> 02:51.270
If I want to find out if I want this whole code in front of me at that particular instant, let me

55
02:51.270 --> 02:51.900
save this.

56
02:52.680 --> 02:59.430
So it will just save it in the sublime text user file, right,  and what I'll do is I simply say cpsimple.

57
03:00.990 --> 03:05.370
dot(.) and we can easily see there is this extension of sublime.

58
03:06.830 --> 03:07.580
snippet right.

59
03:09.100 --> 03:10.660
so cpsimple.sublimesnippet.

60
03:10.660 --> 03:11.980
I'm saving it with the same name.

61
03:12.760 --> 03:12.960
Cool.

62
03:13.240 --> 03:13.900
So let's save it.

63
03:14.380 --> 03:15.190
I've saved this.

64
03:15.190 --> 03:17.230
And you can see it is cpsimple.sublime.

65
03:17.230 --> 03:17.680
snippet.

66
03:17.720 --> 03:18.880
Let's go back.

67
03:19.120 --> 03:20.920
Let's erase everything right, now.

68
03:20.920 --> 03:22.660
We'll write cpsimple.

69
03:23.730 --> 03:24.030
Right.

70
03:24.300 --> 03:27.900
Instead of writing cpsimple, I just pressed Cp and pressed tab.

71
03:28.080 --> 03:32.610
You can also press enter and you'll get the whole code no matter whatever I'm coding out here.

72
03:32.700 --> 03:38.640
Let's say I've written something and like the whole code is there and submitted it and it got accepted

73
03:38.640 --> 03:40.080
in my contest.

74
03:40.410 --> 03:45.480
Right now I want to erase everything and I don't want to write all of this again.

75
03:46.260 --> 03:46.540
Right.

76
03:46.830 --> 03:52.770
So what I'll do is I'll simply select all press cp and I'll get cpsimple press enter.

77
03:53.520 --> 03:54.990
So this is a normal bucking.

78
03:54.990 --> 03:59.850
And now you can write to your code here, take your input accordingly, right to your output accordingly, and do

79
03:59.850 --> 04:00.600
the rest of the work.

80
04:01.230 --> 04:01.430
Right.

81
04:01.470 --> 04:03.330
So this makes a life easier.

82
04:04.240 --> 04:04.560
Right.

83
04:04.900 --> 04:06.670
And it's not only about this, guys.

84
04:07.150 --> 04:10.600
What I can do is we can make other snippets, too.

85
04:11.290 --> 04:11.640
So let's.

86
04:12.040 --> 04:12.550
Let's say

87
04:14.070 --> 04:14.650
In the course.

88
04:14.670 --> 04:19.080
Let's say you're studying about segment trees, fangment trees, a advanced data structure

89
04:19.650 --> 04:25.200
You can make these snippets instead of writing whole segment tree, fagment tree again and again.

90
04:25.200 --> 04:26.340
You just make the snippets.

91
04:26.340 --> 04:28.980
Use these snippets in the code and.

92
04:30.310 --> 04:31.540
Save time right.

93
04:32.290 --> 04:37.270
The more time you save, the better, the more time you will get to think in the contest.

94
04:37.520 --> 04:42.460
Okay, so what we want to do is we want more time to think in the contest and less time to code

95
04:43.030 --> 04:43.360
Right.

96
04:44.700 --> 04:47.380
So this was about snippets, guys.

97
04:47.400 --> 04:51.030
And in the next part we'll be discussing about some defines.

98
04:51.660 --> 04:53.510
Cool, see you in the next part.
