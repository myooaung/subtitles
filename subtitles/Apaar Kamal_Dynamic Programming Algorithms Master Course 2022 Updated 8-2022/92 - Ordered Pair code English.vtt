00:00.600 --> 00:02.220
So let's go to this problem.

00:02.460 --> 00:11.070
And Leslie, let's go to the audience because that was easy for us and can easily see that I'm.

00:12.710 --> 00:14.810
This is a very plain, simple look at the relation.

00:15.410 --> 00:17.780
So in this case, the order matters.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.940
So let me take a number, call in Fig. input and assimilate.

00:22.940 --> 00:23.480
Five.

00:24.980 --> 00:26.990
Or we were taking the example of four eight.

00:27.000 --> 00:27.770
Let's take four.

00:28.250 --> 00:28.790
And what?

00:28.890 --> 00:31.880
Lewis I think he found.

00:32.910 --> 00:35.100
VS and it's ordered.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.370
So in this case, the order matters.

00:38.380 --> 00:39.050
Murders will.

00:40.110 --> 00:44.790
And what we'll do is let's just let me just pass into it now.

00:45.510 --> 00:46.250
What we will do.

00:46.260 --> 00:46.800
Simple.

00:48.450 --> 00:54.780
We have an and let me just implement this because of religion, which is I have a friend who goes to

00:55.820 --> 00:57.020
a mission of unto him.

00:57.660 --> 00:59.120
Let me just implement this first.

01:00.130 --> 01:01.600
I will go from one.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.060
I'll go to Lynn and.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.690
What will you do?

01:06.720 --> 01:08.100
We'll just take some answer.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.980
Is the answer plus equals to count.

01:10.980 --> 01:13.800
B is ordered and it will be.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.580
And minus.

01:15.290 --> 01:15.480
Right.

01:16.290 --> 01:17.550
And finally, will it Indians?

01:18.910 --> 01:20.440
So of course we can memorize it.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.480
But I'm just not worried about my medication right now.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.510
You're just worried about how to call it?

01:25.030 --> 01:26.590
It seems very simple, right?

01:27.260 --> 01:31.250
So this is m that we have taken in the formula.

01:32.360 --> 01:37.430
And what is the best case in this case will be very simple if and equals to zero.

01:37.880 --> 01:38.600
I lived in one.

01:39.500 --> 01:46.380
It means I've reached an ending and now I've just partitioning some process by district in one day.

01:46.610 --> 01:47.330
What are we getting?

01:47.330 --> 01:48.260
We are getting it.

01:48.560 --> 01:49.240
Possibilities.

01:49.580 --> 01:49.880
It.

01:50.210 --> 01:50.840
Let me check.

01:51.350 --> 01:53.900
So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.480
Let me check it for five.

02:00.780 --> 02:01.080
Yeah.

02:01.110 --> 02:03.190
Four, five, five, six, eight two.

02:04.020 --> 02:04.150
How.

02:04.220 --> 02:05.280
How will we get to 16?

02:05.580 --> 02:07.830
If I have one, then we can.

02:07.830 --> 02:09.930
We can take all these after it.

02:10.110 --> 02:11.580
After the after that one.

02:11.580 --> 02:12.690
One plus all these.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.070
Well, it is it here.

02:17.190 --> 02:17.790
This for?

02:18.770 --> 02:19.100
Right.

02:19.310 --> 02:22.010
And it was for strange that these two.

02:23.110 --> 02:23.710
This is.

02:25.290 --> 02:25.800
14.

02:26.160 --> 02:30.250
This is 15 and one last one will be five itself.

02:31.050 --> 02:35.190
So in the as in this case, three itself to itself and 42.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.310
But in the case of I will be five.

02:37.470 --> 02:43.080
And so the total will be it was four plus two plus one plus one, which is 16.

02:43.620 --> 02:45.090
I hope this is clear.

02:45.870 --> 02:46.170
So.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.160
We can generalize this out now for any groups.

02:49.290 --> 02:50.840
Six one What will be the answer?

02:50.840 --> 02:52.220
If I talk about it and go through six?

02:52.490 --> 02:58.610
It will be this summation of all of them, that is, and it goes to one, two, three, four, five

02:58.850 --> 03:01.850
plus one because six will be there as an individual.

03:02.900 --> 03:05.170
Eight and yep.

03:05.570 --> 03:08.670
So let's talk about the complexity of this.

03:08.690 --> 03:09.080
Okay.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.520
Let me memorize it first.

03:12.700 --> 03:16.030
And let's see, we have some and can be anything.

03:16.210 --> 03:18.490
It looks like a big number because.

03:22.140 --> 03:22.590
And.

03:24.340 --> 03:26.040
Really memorization to you.

03:26.160 --> 03:26.580
Or.

03:27.330 --> 03:27.630
Okay.

03:27.900 --> 03:28.140
Okay.

03:28.140 --> 03:28.740
Let's call it.

03:29.220 --> 03:30.900
Owen was ordered in and.

03:31.960 --> 03:39.460
Memo sent memo Gomo minus one comma side of memo eight and.

03:40.920 --> 03:41.820
This will give me a.

03:42.710 --> 03:43.090
Goulding.

03:43.340 --> 03:43.550
Cool.

03:43.580 --> 03:45.560
So I have 1000 over here.

03:45.620 --> 03:54.230
Finally, if I receive a memo and article two minus one and memo in and this is.

04:00.730 --> 04:01.510
Didn't we build it?

04:01.870 --> 04:02.170
Okay.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.760
So I think it's correct now.

04:04.390 --> 04:06.190
So we have insulated neutral housing.

04:06.340 --> 04:11.560
You can insulated tell whatever and you want and we will discuss the complexity of this solution.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.960
And we didn't improve the complexity of this solution.

04:15.010 --> 04:19.420
Well, here, what we can see is for any and what we are trying to do, we are starting from one.

04:19.420 --> 04:25.810
We are going to learn and we are calculating the all possible boundaries for N minus C.

04:26.560 --> 04:33.970
So the complexity of this solution becomes off and square eight by because we have and different states.

04:34.860 --> 04:42.270
Liechtenstein then will have 1097 different states, although a memo using it will conclude for all

04:42.270 --> 04:42.970
the states once.

04:44.640 --> 04:49.730
But see this, for all the states we are running, we are doing this work right this far.

04:49.740 --> 04:51.010
Look from window.

04:51.390 --> 04:56.670
And if I'm doing this fight, look from one end, this is all a little work right before all.

04:56.910 --> 04:58.010
End of the state.

04:58.020 --> 04:58.680
I'm going.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.860
And more times it is and into.

05:01.470 --> 05:05.910
And I have you got the ten complexity your end state.

05:05.910 --> 05:06.390
I agree.

05:06.390 --> 05:10.820
Even after memorization all those end states will be calculated exactly once full.

05:10.890 --> 05:11.400
I agree.

05:11.640 --> 05:17.020
But for all those end states we are again we are doing some work which is going endings it will be and

05:17.020 --> 05:17.350
into.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.580
And so this is wolf and square complexity.

05:20.580 --> 05:21.570
And we do better case.

05:22.380 --> 05:28.140
Yes, we can always do better now as we have seen that it goes evolution is nothing but some of previous

05:28.140 --> 05:28.650
in terms.

05:29.660 --> 05:30.660
But any goes to five.

05:31.250 --> 05:31.490
Yeah.

05:33.170 --> 05:33.730
This one, right?

05:34.160 --> 05:36.950
It is the sum of previous endings.

05:37.700 --> 05:40.250
So for any gods to fight, what will be the case?

05:40.600 --> 05:41.840
And because two, four plus.

05:41.840 --> 05:42.560
Three plus.

05:42.560 --> 05:43.310
Two plus.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.100
One.

05:45.130 --> 05:46.900
Plus, we can say above zero.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.840
Above zero is nothing but one eight.

05:49.300 --> 05:55.810
So what is this f of zero kids when we have just five plus zero, which is nothing but fight it or instead

05:55.810 --> 05:58.480
of this is to avoid confusion, we can write one error.

05:59.770 --> 06:03.010
And what will be the answer for five goes to six.

06:03.190 --> 06:06.940
It will be nothing but a five plus four plus three.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.460
That's two plus one.

06:10.790 --> 06:11.810
Less than eight.

06:11.810 --> 06:12.620
We do have a zero.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.480
Here you can see one thing.

06:14.720 --> 06:20.990
If I start formulating my answer in a bottom up manner, if I want, if I start just formulating mounted

06:20.990 --> 06:26.360
in a bottom up manner, what I can do is I can keep a variable called a sum.

06:27.010 --> 06:29.280
Let's keep a variable called sum pool.

06:29.450 --> 06:33.230
And then what I'll do is let me give some space again.

06:34.820 --> 06:35.150
Yeah.

06:35.420 --> 06:36.590
Actually, I decided to.

06:37.910 --> 06:39.110
These derailed getting problems.

06:39.110 --> 06:43.340
But then I thought this problem is a must before we move on to the marketing problem.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.160
What I'll do is I'll keep a variable called some.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.450
So what will some do?

06:48.450 --> 06:50.400
Some will store Beyonce's.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.530
So in Italian, it's a musical instrument.

06:52.860 --> 06:59.820
And what I do is I would simply say I start from one, I go still and I'm blessed with eight.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.020
So this is a normal for a loop.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.450
I'm running and I'll simply say I'll say that deep.

07:03.450 --> 07:05.220
I will be equal to some.

07:06.790 --> 07:07.930
Eight and.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.970
Let's say the DPA is equal to some in Italy.

07:13.970 --> 07:17.180
Let's make some calls to you and.

07:18.340 --> 07:24.580
Then what we can see is the deposit goes through some plus one, right, and some is equal to two.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.760
And in some what we'll do is I'll simply add DPA.

07:29.510 --> 07:30.260
This is important.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.210
Let's go over it again.

07:33.780 --> 07:39.810
What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to maintain a variable culture, which is kind of when I'm on one,

07:39.810 --> 07:40.530
it will.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.770
Have what is ever one when I want to, it will contain the smoke.

07:44.770 --> 07:45.550
I have one plus two.

07:45.910 --> 07:51.820
When I leave F3 it will have the sum of F1 plus two plus three, which will be was in F4 foot and then

07:51.820 --> 07:53.620
it will take the sum of F4 Forestville.

07:54.670 --> 07:54.920
Eight.

07:55.390 --> 07:57.850
I hope this has been clearer.

07:57.940 --> 08:03.700
So whenever I'm moving forward, I'm just whatever I'm calculating, I'm calculating using some and

08:03.700 --> 08:07.090
then I'm updating them with the summation of it all.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.530
So let me quickly quote this.

08:09.620 --> 08:12.020
And yeah, this was a bottom up manner.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.670
Let me go to Indy.

08:15.170 --> 08:16.050
So this was.

08:17.380 --> 08:25.300
Top down approach, which was taking off and square time and I was not able to optimize it further because

08:25.300 --> 08:29.770
we are running this for loop inside, but we can optimize this by taking a variable called something.

08:30.070 --> 08:35.470
Let's take a variable called sum and let's take up variable and a p.

08:36.740 --> 08:38.180
Eight or nine plus one.

08:39.440 --> 08:39.830
Lent.

08:40.190 --> 08:44.960
In Italy, audiences will say DP zero is.

08:46.330 --> 08:46.660
You don't?

08:47.030 --> 08:50.470
Well, we don't want it, actually, but let's just ignore it.

08:50.860 --> 08:54.250
And it started from when I was still in.

08:56.590 --> 08:56.790
Yeah.

08:57.640 --> 09:05.110
And I'll simply say that DP I is equals to some plus one, my plus one plus one because that number

09:05.110 --> 09:06.610
can be individual also.

09:07.330 --> 09:09.860
And then I will simply add PND.

09:12.450 --> 09:13.890
Always, always.

09:13.890 --> 09:16.530
The sun will be storing the sum of previous dips.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.060
It's what I need.

09:18.060 --> 09:20.790
And whenever I'm dating, debate will be someplace.

09:21.240 --> 09:21.570
But.

09:22.520 --> 09:22.790
Well.

09:23.740 --> 09:28.030
If you want me to write it, then I can write it.

09:29.050 --> 09:29.530
In Italy.

09:29.530 --> 09:31.960
Let's say it's a disease I will use.

09:32.380 --> 09:35.410
One, two, three, four, five, six.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.200
And initially.

09:39.910 --> 09:43.150
This is some values and this is the deep values that are stored.

09:43.690 --> 09:44.770
But initialism is zero.

09:45.100 --> 09:45.850
The world will be.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.470
So when I'll come on one.

09:47.800 --> 09:48.690
What it will do.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.680
It will take deep of when he goes to someplace fun.

09:51.100 --> 09:51.850
Some is zero.

09:52.970 --> 09:55.640
And some plus one will be equal to one.

09:56.060 --> 09:56.990
Now what will happen?

09:57.290 --> 09:59.250
Some will also get updated by DPA.

09:59.270 --> 10:00.710
So what is DPA one?

10:00.710 --> 10:02.460
And I'll simply add one in this.

10:04.370 --> 10:08.390
Well, now, when I reach to some is equals to one.

10:09.670 --> 10:12.430
Initially dippy will be equal to some.

10:12.430 --> 10:19.900
Plus, you will recall two samples, one with just two, and now some will be updated and two will be

10:19.900 --> 10:21.970
added to it, which is three.

10:22.810 --> 10:23.620
I hope you're getting this.

10:23.980 --> 10:29.920
Some gets updated again and again when at least three initialism is three, BP will be calculated from

10:29.920 --> 10:31.060
this one, which is four.

10:31.360 --> 10:37.900
And now in three I'll add four because somebody I'm adding to pay for it is seven.

10:39.500 --> 10:39.610
Four.

10:39.730 --> 10:40.110
Four.

10:40.420 --> 10:41.170
Let me seven.

10:41.800 --> 10:49.090
Seven plus one is 830 P Goodspeed and then April seven is 1608 and again 16.

10:49.090 --> 10:50.200
Initially 16.

10:51.310 --> 10:52.870
Yeah, only 16.

10:52.870 --> 10:54.730
Initially 16 a plus one is.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.170
17 and.

10:58.590 --> 10:58.920
Okay.

11:01.180 --> 11:02.920
Yes, I'm doing okay.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.500
So here it was seven.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.120
Seven games and plus Brisbane is eight.

11:08.330 --> 11:09.510
It May seven is 15.

11:09.530 --> 11:10.000
Sorry.

11:10.010 --> 11:10.280
Yeah.

11:10.490 --> 11:12.230
Now 15 goes here.

11:12.770 --> 11:14.150
15 plus one is 16.

11:14.780 --> 11:18.290
Now 16 will be added to 15 and some will be upgraded, which is 31.

11:20.140 --> 11:21.100
So here you can see.

11:21.970 --> 11:26.500
Well it's pretty easy that the deep values that it offers of.

11:27.690 --> 11:35.820
So basically it is nothing more to restore the power and minus one eight for any of than.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.470
You can easily check this rule.

11:39.920 --> 11:46.910
So now we're coming on to the third solution for this audit period, which is this was a bottom up approach.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.760
Bottom up.

11:50.580 --> 11:52.200
ROACH And no, finally we have.

11:53.160 --> 11:58.500
So the complexity of the bottom approach, the complexity of the bottom up approach is nothing but orphan

11:58.500 --> 12:04.800
because we are just running a loop from one to the third approach that I have for this problem is simple,

12:04.800 --> 12:06.240
which is to restore the power.

12:07.370 --> 12:08.900
And minus one.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.450
What is doing is the rover in minus one.

12:11.490 --> 12:13.130
So if I ran, I just see out.

12:15.780 --> 12:17.170
Power coma.

12:18.390 --> 12:19.260
Coma and minus four.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.920
So this is the all.

12:23.100 --> 12:23.880
One approach.

12:24.710 --> 12:27.140
For one approach for the above problem.

12:28.180 --> 12:32.110
I hope all of this is making some sense to everyone of us.

12:32.700 --> 12:32.980
Right.

12:32.980 --> 12:34.570
So we have three different ways of.

12:35.570 --> 12:36.770
Figuring out the same problem.

12:38.210 --> 12:40.700
Rob Dunn with Walden Square automobile.

12:40.700 --> 12:46.570
You go in and then we had this mathematical formula which is to restore the power and minus one rule.

12:47.310 --> 12:47.630
So.

12:49.070 --> 12:55.520
I hope you got this about the ordered said alert so far then ordered said in the next food.

12:56.180 --> 12:56.600
Thank you.
