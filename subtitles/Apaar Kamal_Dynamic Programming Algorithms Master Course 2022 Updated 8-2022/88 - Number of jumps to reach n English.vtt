Hello Everyone so a very quick problem.

00:02.970 --> 00:07.290
It will not take much time because you all know how to solve this.

00:09.090 --> 00:14.390
So it just says the number of ways n can be written as sum of 1,2,3

00:14.760 --> 00:19.410
So for example, let's say n is equals to five right, then how many number of ways are there?

00:19.440 --> 00:21.810
Okay, let's take us a small case, let's say, N is equal to one.

00:22.070 --> 00:24.300
There's only one way and if N is equal to two.

00:24.300 --> 00:29.880
Then we can write it as one plus one, or we can also write it as 2, if n is equal to three.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.950
then we can write it as one plus one plus one.

00:32.890 --> 00:35.020
One plus two, two plus one.

00:35.060 --> 00:38.770
See, remember two plus one is different from one plus two.

00:38.770 --> 00:39.640
Don't forget this.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.270
These are two different ways.

00:42.780 --> 00:44.740
And the last one is Three.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.830
What about N equals to four now?

00:47.880 --> 00:50.040
Now you can easily see the pattern.

00:51.150 --> 00:53.250
So for N equals to four is nothing but.

00:54.610 --> 01:00.250
The number of ways in which I can write N = 3,and I will add one after them if I want

01:00.250 --> 01:02.300
to add one after them right.

01:02.320 --> 01:08.460
So basically it is f(n) equals to f(n-1) because if I want to add one after them, 

01:08.470 --> 01:14.890
f(n-2) if I want to add two after them basically number of ways in which F two is written.

01:14.890 --> 01:20.890
And I want to add two after each of them plus number of ways in which one is written and I want to add

01:21.790 --> 01:22.510
three after them.

01:23.020 --> 01:23.300
Right.

01:24.190 --> 01:28.690
So if I sum it up, so what it, what it will give me, it will give me one plus three.

01:28.690 --> 01:31.390
This will give me one plus one plus two, two plus two.

01:31.780 --> 01:37.720
And the last one will give me one plus one plus one plus one, one plus two plus one, two plus one

01:37.720 --> 01:39.130
plus one and three plus one.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.010
These are the number of ways in which I can write.

01:43.980 --> 01:46.020
similarly for 5 what it will be.

01:46.470 --> 01:52.410
If I want to add one, the number of ways in which I can write 4 add one in number of ways in

01:52.410 --> 01:52.980
which I can write.

01:52.980 --> 01:57.070
Three add two number of ways in which I can write two add three simple.

01:57.720 --> 01:58.890
So we have already seen this.

01:58.890 --> 02:01.470
It's a very quick example of combinatorial games.

02:02.160 --> 02:02.490
I.

02:04.720 --> 02:05.490
You want me to code it?

02:06.070 --> 02:07.180
I don't think so I will.

02:08.260 --> 02:08.960
coding is needed in this.

02:08.980 --> 02:14.760
It's just a very simple relations fibonacci series, I call it fibonacci series

02:16.000 --> 02:16.120
So.

02:16.180 --> 02:16.390
Yeah.

02:16.540 --> 02:16.900
Thank you.

02:16.970 --> 02:17.830
all, see you in the next part
