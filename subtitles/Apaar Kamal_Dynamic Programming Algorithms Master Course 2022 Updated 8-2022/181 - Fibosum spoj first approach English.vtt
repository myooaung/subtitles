00:00.590 --> 00:01.250
Hello, everyone.

00:01.640 --> 00:02.900
Let's solve this problem.

00:03.320 --> 00:04.670
It would seem from Spot.

00:05.820 --> 00:07.470
So it's very easy.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.460
The problem statement.

00:08.550 --> 00:15.690
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the following relation f0 F1 they are values and F1 is open minus

00:15.690 --> 00:16.500
and both have been managed.

00:16.500 --> 00:23.040
We all know this, so your task is very simple given to non-negative integers anonyme.

00:23.310 --> 00:27.350
You have to calculate the sum f.n plus f1 plus when they leave them.

00:27.960 --> 00:32.970
Basically you have to find out the sum of these series of unique numbers from F1 to form.

00:33.510 --> 00:33.820
They.

00:34.770 --> 00:37.050
And of course, Marta, we know about Madrid.

00:37.770 --> 00:41.220
So this is the input airlines.

00:41.220 --> 00:44.810
And after all these delays will have the 0335 in all listings.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.640
So how to approach this problem?

00:48.510 --> 00:50.030
We've already seen eight.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.620
How do I know if we've been talking about using metrics exponential?

00:53.610 --> 00:56.800
So there are two approaches for this problem.

00:56.820 --> 01:04.140
The first one actually both uses the metric expansion, but there are two different ways of using it.

01:04.530 --> 01:10.780
The first one is to figure out a triggering solution laid off of the summit, as we saw.

01:10.780 --> 01:11.070
Right.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.890
We were making the time metrics, be metrics.

01:13.890 --> 01:14.790
We had many things.

01:15.300 --> 01:19.200
Similarly, we can take some like some of some talent.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.690
And let's let me name the term.

01:21.690 --> 01:24.270
It's called S, n, let's call it s, n or D.

01:24.270 --> 01:26.110
This, in essence, is a.

01:27.100 --> 01:31.600
Some tail end through an acronym, but it basically did have zero plus one.

01:32.860 --> 01:41.380
Let's have two little F and eight and an end will be M letting f m.

01:41.620 --> 01:44.950
And if we subtract as m minus.

01:46.890 --> 01:47.250
And.

01:48.460 --> 01:51.040
Or instead let's minus s in minus one.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.230
Then we can simply get what we want, which is.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.800
Come from Dylan.

01:56.280 --> 01:56.700
Eight days.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.610
I hope you we all know this because it's terrific.

01:59.610 --> 02:06.030
Some trade off, some some foreign changes, some minus the previous some remove it and we'll get this

02:06.720 --> 02:14.370
I hope this is very clear I but then how to of old lesson of you can make could be metrics in which

02:14.370 --> 02:21.450
you can Anderson and then see how does that you can make an effort metrics in which you can add this

02:21.450 --> 02:22.740
lesson right?

02:23.160 --> 02:24.540
You can have a third very well that is.

02:24.930 --> 02:26.460
And finally you're going to have a.

02:27.530 --> 02:30.110
Um, the metrics accordingly.

02:30.770 --> 02:32.660
That's one of the appraisals goes there as well.

02:33.020 --> 02:36.260
But before moving to that approach, I want to discuss a very nice approach.

02:36.430 --> 02:40.430
It's based on the property of unique numbers and we'll derive that property.

02:40.820 --> 02:41.100
Right.

02:41.690 --> 02:42.180
So a.

02:43.610 --> 02:45.920
We say that effen is equal to.

02:47.260 --> 02:52.780
F and minus one plus F and minus two.

02:52.990 --> 02:55.270
So let's see what F in minus two here is.

02:56.350 --> 03:00.700
They open minus two is equal to seven.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.390
Minus F and minus one.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.950
I hope you agree on this point.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.320
Right.

03:06.950 --> 03:07.250
So.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.640
Well, so what will we have in minus three here?

03:10.820 --> 03:11.930
It will be nothing but open.

03:11.930 --> 03:12.500
Minus one.

03:12.500 --> 03:13.760
Minus F and minus.

03:14.970 --> 03:16.200
Too late.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.030
I hope we are on the same page over here.

03:18.540 --> 03:19.530
And so until.

03:20.860 --> 03:21.730
Let's have zero.

03:22.030 --> 03:22.870
What is a zero?

03:23.940 --> 03:24.210
Okay.

03:24.210 --> 03:28.050
Let me try one more and then we'll do so until of zero.

03:28.890 --> 03:30.410
It is a friend -40.

03:30.410 --> 03:31.980
It goes to a friend minus.

03:34.610 --> 03:36.080
F and minus three.

03:36.530 --> 03:37.880
Minus F and minus.

03:39.290 --> 03:42.320
Two raids and invasion was an investment in my history and witness.

03:44.590 --> 03:47.830
Who am I doing something wrong?

03:47.830 --> 03:52.470
You end up in my nest who is often minors have been my best friend.

03:52.480 --> 03:55.870
Okay, so F and ministries F in minus one.

03:55.870 --> 03:57.340
Minus F and minus two.

03:58.500 --> 03:58.890
Right.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.850
Even minus four is equal to.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.010
If in minus the.

04:07.590 --> 04:08.370
Okay.

04:08.370 --> 04:09.840
Citing destroying tree.

04:09.840 --> 04:10.530
Should we replace?

04:12.030 --> 04:12.270
Eight.

04:12.510 --> 04:16.560
And so until 000 is nothing but a fourth.

04:18.150 --> 04:21.840
Let's put zero in this and let's put and it goes to two here.

04:22.210 --> 04:27.570
They will give me a form zero and this will be F of two minus F of one.

04:28.830 --> 04:30.080
I hope this is fine.

04:30.930 --> 04:31.350
Now, these.

04:31.350 --> 04:31.850
Whatever.

04:31.890 --> 04:34.780
Add the elegies and the adages.

04:34.950 --> 04:35.110
It.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.390
Let's add these values.

04:38.140 --> 04:39.200
At these values.

04:39.200 --> 04:45.410
This is nothing but as zero plus F1 plus or until F1 minus two.

04:46.420 --> 04:52.600
Late and what is on the allergies on the on the origins that I didn't cite, I can easily see that this

04:52.600 --> 04:59.950
cancels out this similarly this cancels out this eight because minus plus minus plus they already canceled

04:59.950 --> 05:05.110
on each other and in the end, F2 will also get cancelled because of some values over here.

05:06.130 --> 05:10.180
I know what will get will get is it goes to F in minus F one.

05:11.690 --> 05:11.960
Right.

05:12.450 --> 05:12.830
What?

05:13.130 --> 05:19.610
What I can see here is that still and very still and minus two eight, because it is starting from zero

05:19.610 --> 05:23.300
and going Dillon minus two is equal to F in.

05:24.350 --> 05:25.850
Minus one.

05:26.090 --> 05:28.730
Everyone is one night through an economic often.

05:29.770 --> 05:38.020
So if I want to replace and burn by MN let's replace end by end plus to what I'll get Elliot Essen is

05:38.020 --> 05:41.410
it goes to F and plus two minus one.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.460
A very simple reconciliation.

05:45.280 --> 05:52.960
So if I if I if I want to find out s m minus s in which is equal to 30.

05:55.460 --> 05:55.640
Yeah.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.840
I wonder if I know this one from m22.

05:57.860 --> 06:01.910
F m doing this is what s m minus.

06:03.050 --> 06:03.260
Okay.

06:03.290 --> 06:05.030
Let me not add the brackets.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.330
Minus as in minus one, which will be what is esim?

06:08.330 --> 06:12.170
According to this equation, it is f off and plus two.

06:12.170 --> 06:14.840
Minus one minus what?

06:15.110 --> 06:17.150
What will be s in minus one.

06:17.150 --> 06:25.460
According to this relation it will be F and plus one minus one made because here I n minus one here

06:25.460 --> 06:26.990
I replace and one minus one.

06:26.990 --> 06:28.850
So this end will become in plus one.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.720
Well, let's practice this cancels out this.

06:34.140 --> 06:38.040
What I have got even plus two minus F and plus one.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.050
So this is the final answer.

06:43.050 --> 06:46.270
And we all know how to find out different keys and what, right?

06:46.590 --> 06:47.950
So we can easily find them.

06:48.120 --> 06:55.290
Plus two, we can easily find out if and plus one we can subtract them, add more ignored because that

06:55.290 --> 06:56.610
model properties is important.

06:56.910 --> 06:57.690
Don't forget them.

06:58.290 --> 07:01.830
Eight Because in sports the answer is required.

07:01.830 --> 07:06.150
After digging what you subtract them, add more and then take more.

07:06.810 --> 07:11.970
I hope this is very fine so you can easily go there now because there's nothing left and we have already

07:11.970 --> 07:15.330
coded how to find out the Rubinek number.

07:16.250 --> 07:16.490
Well.

07:17.860 --> 07:18.810
Well, thank you, everyone.

07:18.820 --> 07:24.310
Let's see you in the next part in which we will be using metrics exponential to figure out this.

07:26.520 --> 07:27.530
Coalition would.
