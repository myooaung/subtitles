WEBVTT

00:00.840 --> 00:00.980
Okay.

00:01.160 --> 00:08.240
So as we have freshly understood what are what is a DFC and what is package?

00:08.750 --> 00:12.980
So we are like ready to understand what are our articulation points in bridges.

00:13.760 --> 00:17.990
But first of all, explain you what are these point and what are bridges?

00:18.440 --> 00:21.650
But these are small requests from you all.

00:22.370 --> 00:26.840
We will only move forward once you have understood basics of dynamic programming.

00:27.260 --> 00:33.410
Of course, dining programming is not necessarily here because I'll be explaining dynamic programming

00:33.410 --> 00:34.430
on my part too.

00:34.430 --> 00:34.790
Right.

00:35.210 --> 00:42.260
But again, think if you know a little basics of dynamic programming, it will ease your understanding,

00:42.260 --> 00:43.670
put articulation points in bridges.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.280
So what are the required topics to understand?

00:46.280 --> 00:47.570
Articulation points in bridges?

00:48.240 --> 00:50.120
We should know what is RDF history?

00:51.560 --> 00:56.930
We should know more is a package that we have discussed in the previous sections.

00:57.360 --> 01:04.340
Eight And after both of these we have to apply a little bit of dynamic programming so don't get like

01:05.120 --> 01:06.020
confusing all.

01:07.230 --> 01:08.280
Scared, of course.

01:08.310 --> 01:08.580
Right.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.640
Because I'll be explaining it in a very easy manner.

01:12.600 --> 01:18.450
And of course, dining programming will be used, but you won't be feeling it, right?

01:18.900 --> 01:19.200
Okay.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.370
This is dynamic programming.

01:20.370 --> 01:21.110
Nothing like that.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.340
It's very easy, but it will go one by one.

01:24.360 --> 01:29.190
First of all, let us understand what is articulation point and what are bridges right then?

01:29.190 --> 01:30.060
Articulation point.

01:30.060 --> 01:35.130
According to their definition, we can see that it's a vertically interconnected graph.

01:35.790 --> 01:42.360
It's an articulation point if and only if the deletion of the vertex V together with all the edges and

01:42.360 --> 01:48.090
incidental v disconnects the graph into two or more non empty components.

01:48.990 --> 01:58.380
So the definition simply means that if I were vertex V in my graph and I am actually removing that vertex

01:58.380 --> 02:04.380
and all the edges associated with it, whatever that is, which was associated with that vertex, I'm

02:04.380 --> 02:05.660
removing them from the graph.

02:05.670 --> 02:06.030
Right.

02:06.340 --> 02:09.630
So that means there is no component of.

02:10.870 --> 02:11.950
It didn't make it afraid.

02:12.460 --> 02:12.720
Yeah.

02:12.730 --> 02:17.290
So I hope you understood the definition of articulation.

02:17.290 --> 02:18.460
Point eight.

02:18.830 --> 02:23.290
So if I'm removing it, the graph is divided into more number of components.

02:24.220 --> 02:31.090
That means if I remove their niche, then the vertices that were the buds between the vertices that

02:31.090 --> 02:32.060
were already there.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.910
Now that part is normal.

02:33.910 --> 02:34.780
They are disconnected.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.520
And what is a bridge?

02:36.520 --> 02:37.410
Bridges in it.

02:38.720 --> 02:39.320
In the graph.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.250
Of course, if an, if, if and only if, removing it disconnects the graph.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.180
Again, it's a very simple definition.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.370
Articulation point is a.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.310
No right.

02:48.310 --> 02:51.610
It is a vertex of the graph, but bridge is the edge.

02:52.480 --> 02:52.690
Okay.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.080
So I have I have some few examples here.

02:56.590 --> 03:01.600
Let us discuss what are articulation points in these and what are bridges and.

03:03.170 --> 03:06.320
Then in the next, Biden will understand how do we actually find them out?

03:06.350 --> 03:10.280
Using the history back ages and then reprogram?

03:10.820 --> 03:14.330
Well, of course, guys, it's a little, little heavy topic.

03:14.510 --> 03:15.380
Not that much.

03:15.470 --> 03:15.710
Right.

03:15.740 --> 03:20.210
But still, you need to spend time on this to understand it.

03:20.210 --> 03:20.510
Right.

03:20.990 --> 03:21.470
And.

03:22.550 --> 03:22.850
Yeah.

03:23.090 --> 03:23.870
So let's understand.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.600
What is our adolescent point and what are bridges?

03:27.620 --> 03:29.420
So in the first figure, this one.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.790
In the first week of phase one, two and three.

03:33.920 --> 03:34.210
Right.

03:34.270 --> 03:36.130
So let's draw over articulation points first.

03:36.700 --> 03:39.700
If I remove edge one, then what is the remaining graph?

03:39.850 --> 03:41.410
The remaining graph is to entry.

03:42.400 --> 03:51.460
Eight because I've removed edge one, but I removed Vertex one and its component and its adjusting edges

03:51.460 --> 03:56.620
also read its incident that its connected edges from the graph and what is the remaining properties

03:56.620 --> 03:57.190
to entry.

03:57.190 --> 03:58.420
And those are connected.

03:58.420 --> 03:58.630
Eight.

04:00.850 --> 04:02.680
Well one being articulation point.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.040
Think about the definition, guys.

04:07.710 --> 04:12.300
What is an articulation point if and only if the deletion of the vertex would be together with all the

04:12.300 --> 04:12.810
edges.

04:13.380 --> 04:16.740
Disconnect the graph into two or more empty components.

04:18.060 --> 04:22.320
Is it disconnecting the graph into more component naught eight here?

04:22.320 --> 04:25.410
Also the graph ID one component here.

04:25.410 --> 04:26.310
Also the graphs.

04:27.170 --> 04:27.950
One company.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.100
No one will not be in our deflation point.

04:31.610 --> 04:33.420
Another will do another try.

04:34.220 --> 04:37.940
They because the number of connected components in the graph stays the same.

04:38.540 --> 04:38.810
Eight.

04:39.850 --> 04:44.770
Now let's let us figure out the bridges and the first figure bridges.

04:45.490 --> 04:51.940
So what a bridge is in the first figure, its name that is also one, two and three will struggle with

04:51.940 --> 04:52.420
the first two.

04:52.570 --> 04:55.000
If I remove the bridge, what is the remaining graph?

04:55.000 --> 04:55.900
I have this graph.

04:57.090 --> 04:59.910
Hey, look, guys, again, the same definition.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.170
Is the graph disconnected?

05:02.680 --> 05:02.960
No.

05:02.980 --> 05:05.920
That is the graph divided into more number of connected components.

05:06.280 --> 05:06.550
No.

05:06.550 --> 05:06.880
Right.

05:07.180 --> 05:08.380
Will this be a bridge?

05:09.700 --> 05:10.030
No.

05:10.840 --> 05:11.170
Right.

05:12.310 --> 05:17.840
Also, as you can see in the first figure, there is no budget and there is no articulation point because

05:18.080 --> 05:22.880
even after removing them, the graph and the number of components in the graph, the number of connected

05:22.880 --> 05:24.770
components in the graph remains the same.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.110
Okay, let's talk about the second figure ways.

05:27.750 --> 05:32.090
So as begins in the first figure, we had a cycle and all the nodes were a part of the cycle.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.690
In the second figure, we will see that we have this.

05:36.920 --> 05:37.460
Do you write?

05:37.830 --> 05:38.850
We have a tree over here.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.970
We have n minus one edges and nodes and it is completely connected.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.710
Also, we will have further discussion on trees in the coming sections.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.000
We'll discuss lots, lots about trees.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.470
They loads of about trees.

05:50.170 --> 05:51.240
We'll so.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.210
Tell me that.

05:55.670 --> 05:57.070
Let's remove some words.

05:57.350 --> 06:00.980
So let's remove Vertex seven rule.

06:01.550 --> 06:04.860
If I didn't move vertex seven, guess what will be the remaining three?

06:04.860 --> 06:07.820
It will be one, two and five, four.

06:08.830 --> 06:10.290
Three and six.

06:10.850 --> 06:17.740
Eight after removing seven as the graph divided into more connected components.

06:18.340 --> 06:18.610
No.

06:18.610 --> 06:18.910
Right.

06:19.720 --> 06:24.870
Because so we had one connected component and now also we have one connected gun eight.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.380
But let's remove.

06:27.540 --> 06:28.650
So let's move to.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.530
Well to end it at disengages.

06:31.780 --> 06:33.600
These were the four ideas associated with it.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.850
Earlier we had one connected component.

06:35.860 --> 06:41.730
Now we have one, two, three and four connected components.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.870
We have four connected components at eight.

06:44.230 --> 06:48.370
As we can see, the graph is been divided into more number of connected components.

06:48.370 --> 06:50.740
So two is the articulation point.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.310
Greece.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.590
Well, let's talk about some other edge, some other note.

06:58.540 --> 06:59.320
Very simple guys.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.820
Again, I'm repeating the same thing.

07:00.820 --> 07:04.870
Remove the node if you want to find out whether or not it is articulation, point or not, just remove

07:04.870 --> 07:07.910
it and then check the number of connected components in the graph.

07:08.470 --> 07:08.710
Hey.

07:10.450 --> 07:13.000
Two, two, three, five, four and six.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.950
Let's talk about four again.

07:14.950 --> 07:15.760
If I do move forward.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.790
The upper part will be separated from six.

07:19.660 --> 07:23.410
The graph will be disconnected and it will be divided into more connected components.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.590
Well, I hope this has been clear.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.330
Let's talk about bridge.

07:29.740 --> 07:35.830
Here we can see that every edge is a bridge aid because removing any of the edges will divide the graph

07:35.830 --> 07:37.330
into more connected components.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.070
It will disconnect the tree.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.410
Right, because there is no signal in this graph.

07:42.530 --> 07:42.760
Eight.

07:43.630 --> 07:47.080
Well, so there can be this way.

07:47.080 --> 07:54.010
Guys like this can be an approach to like if there is no such constraint limit, there's no such time

07:54.010 --> 07:59.650
limit and there is no such complexity limit that you have to do it in a good complexity.

08:00.010 --> 08:04.840
What we can do is we can simply say whether or not is an articulation point or bridges by.

08:05.900 --> 08:09.140
Firstly we have a graph find objects and metal connected components.

08:09.540 --> 08:14.420
Then you want to find out whether a node x is a articulation point or not.

08:14.720 --> 08:18.860
Just make a graph without Nordics and it's a distinct edges.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.910
Now find a number of connected components so the number of connected component increases.

08:23.930 --> 08:25.360
Then it was an articulation point.

08:25.370 --> 08:27.460
Otherwise it was not an articulation point.

08:27.470 --> 08:31.520
And we all know how to find the number of connected components we can find it using.

08:31.520 --> 08:35.090
Be a phrase, we can find it using DFS, we can find it using DSU.

08:36.110 --> 08:38.390
There are lots of approaches to solve this.

08:39.160 --> 08:39.560
Well, guess.

08:40.500 --> 08:44.400
So the approach that I'm discussing right now is very simple.

08:44.670 --> 08:49.560
There is no no DFS genomic guest, no dating, roaming, nothing is involved.

08:49.590 --> 08:49.950
Right.

08:50.190 --> 08:56.040
But of course, we won't always get the easiest approaches right in the pudding.

08:56.040 --> 08:56.400
Don't.

08:57.330 --> 08:58.140
In the contest.

08:58.230 --> 09:01.320
They go all those rounds for those contests.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.790
We need something special, right?

09:02.790 --> 09:08.610
So that the complexity of my solution is still less, for that will be using the above approaches and

09:08.610 --> 09:14.910
will discover a new way to find out this are relation points on bridges and of course guys it's very

09:14.910 --> 09:16.680
interesting very, very interesting.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.640
Like the first time when I and a student I felt very great.

09:21.810 --> 09:24.300
Yeah, I actually very pleased about it.

09:24.660 --> 09:27.120
Okay, so let's move forward.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.310
Let's move on to the third figure.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.220
So guys here we can see we have psyches, we don't have cycles.

09:32.490 --> 09:34.060
It's a mixed, mixed up figure, right?

09:34.060 --> 09:34.710
In the third one.

09:35.310 --> 09:39.960
In the third figure, grace is one and our relation point no.

09:39.960 --> 09:40.260
Right.

09:40.410 --> 09:45.390
Because if I remove it again the graph is still connected, is true in our relation point.

09:46.490 --> 09:46.940
Yes.

09:47.700 --> 09:50.010
Eat, eat, do is a part of a cycle.

09:50.010 --> 09:52.290
We can see one, two and three are a part of a cycle.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.420
But to do in our relation point.

09:55.610 --> 09:56.130
Hey, guys.

09:56.720 --> 10:00.200
I used to be an articulation point, because if I remove two, then one, three.

10:01.080 --> 10:05.520
Is a separate graph and four, five, six, seven is a separate graph.

10:06.450 --> 10:08.160
We have two components here.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.880
If I remove two energies, right, it's strong about three.

10:12.030 --> 10:14.370
So again, if I remove three, it's not an articulation.

10:14.370 --> 10:18.000
Being eight, removing four will be an articulation point.

10:18.780 --> 10:20.290
Five is an articulation.

10:20.340 --> 10:20.640
No.

10:20.650 --> 10:22.050
Five is not an articulation point.

10:22.050 --> 10:23.940
Six will not be an articulation point again.

10:24.570 --> 10:26.220
Seven will not be in our relation point.

10:28.740 --> 10:29.000
Will.

10:29.920 --> 10:36.850
But if the disturbance now goes on, as we ever understood that these water articulation points and

10:36.850 --> 10:39.040
water bridges will weaken.

10:39.910 --> 10:41.830
Okay, so let's throw our bridges in the third figure.

10:42.610 --> 10:44.380
Is this edge?

10:44.380 --> 10:44.860
This one?

10:45.400 --> 10:46.630
Is it a bridge?

10:46.690 --> 10:47.140
No.

10:47.200 --> 10:47.890
This is a bridge.

10:47.930 --> 10:48.790
No, this is a bridge.

10:48.800 --> 10:49.720
No, this is a bridge.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.190
No, no, no, no.

10:51.550 --> 10:52.870
But is this a bridge, guys?

10:53.750 --> 10:54.170
Yes.

10:54.950 --> 10:58.200
So this edge, this particular edge is a bridge, right.

10:58.310 --> 11:01.340
Because it is dividing graph into more number of connected components.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.100
Well, it's very easy, right?

11:04.130 --> 11:06.580
So this is a good for you guys.

11:06.590 --> 11:10.100
I'm not explaining this whether or not it is an articulation point.

11:10.100 --> 11:10.800
So but it is this.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.730
Just do it yourself.

11:12.970 --> 11:14.650
Now it's very easy to figure it out.

11:14.700 --> 11:18.680
Now the main logic is it's dividing it off into more connected components.

11:19.050 --> 11:21.020
Will you guys.

11:21.830 --> 11:24.800
I were thinking essays for you, basically.

11:25.160 --> 11:25.850
So after the.

11:26.800 --> 11:31.480
Tutorial ends, you have to think that if a node is a part of a cycle.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.220
Let me know if a node.

11:36.510 --> 11:37.950
If it is a part of a cycle.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.180
Will it be an articulation point?

11:51.540 --> 11:54.000
But then will it not to be an articulation point?

11:54.110 --> 11:56.390
Let's not not be an articulation point, right?

11:56.880 --> 12:02.030
If a node is a part of a cycle, then will not be an articulation point always.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.750
Or it can be an articulation point.

12:03.780 --> 12:11.520
You need to think about this and similar for other edges, but if an edge is a part of forsaken, then

12:11.520 --> 12:15.360
will it be an articulation point or will it be a braided alternate?

12:15.990 --> 12:20.670
I just think about this and like make various graphs and try to figure it out.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.220
Well, I'll be discussing this in the next part.

12:24.090 --> 12:25.170
So thank you, guys.

12:25.890 --> 12:26.600
In the next book.
