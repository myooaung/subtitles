WEBVTT

00:00.760 --> 00:00.890
No.

00:00.940 --> 00:02.970
Everyone got to come to this lecture.

00:02.980 --> 00:07.240
And here you can easily see that I have a problem open in front of me.

00:07.720 --> 00:13.330
And you can also see the title of the problem, which is as stupid as it was out in June of Computing

00:13.330 --> 00:14.920
Olympiad of 2014.

00:16.420 --> 00:23.680
And the problem is the best problem to begin with for the anime programming scene, when we will be

00:23.680 --> 00:24.760
discussing this problem.

00:25.420 --> 00:34.060
And before moving forward, I would strongly suggest that you pause the video, you try this problem

00:34.060 --> 00:34.680
yourself.

00:34.690 --> 00:40.030
So here's is a problem statement and the right you can see the is an example input this in understand

00:40.030 --> 00:43.270
the problem before I explain it and.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.410
Right this input and just see what output you get.

00:47.980 --> 00:49.530
Try different approaches that.

00:49.560 --> 00:49.890
Uh.

00:50.410 --> 00:50.670
Uh.

00:50.750 --> 00:51.040
Okay.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.240
So what I suggested.

00:52.580 --> 00:52.850
Right.

00:53.010 --> 00:55.440
And different greedy approaches to this.

00:55.450 --> 00:58.210
Always a very thin line between and B being greedy.

00:58.210 --> 00:58.480
Right.

00:58.900 --> 01:07.060
Because for every dynamic programming problem we try to, uh, we try to think of it in a greedy manner.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.340
Like, if we do this first, then there's.

01:10.420 --> 01:17.230
But in that way we can have the minimum answers, so we will not go here with it with the enemy programming

01:17.950 --> 01:21.310
it this posit that it always.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.810
Dryer approaches whatever you can.

01:24.810 --> 01:27.570
And then, of course, I'll be explaining the dynamic programming approaches.

01:27.900 --> 01:34.820
We'll see how to approach this problem and what other examples are over here.

01:34.820 --> 01:35.100
Right.

01:35.460 --> 01:39.270
Also, we'll see how, how and why this solution does not work.

01:39.270 --> 01:45.300
So I just take an example of one solution that you all might also be thinking about, most probably,

01:45.570 --> 01:48.060
and then we'll discuss Vivobook will.

01:50.740 --> 01:55.840
So I hope you have gone through the problem and try to solve it once.

01:56.680 --> 01:56.920
Okay.

01:56.920 --> 02:03.090
Let me reiterate once vote in ICAO school, all students have to participate regularly in secret.

02:03.850 --> 02:06.010
This is something kind of a duty.

02:06.010 --> 02:06.340
Right.

02:06.820 --> 02:10.810
So these are different s who bw activity each day and.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.250
Each activity has its own duration.

02:14.610 --> 02:19.320
Schedule for the next term has been announced, including information or the number of minutes taken

02:19.320 --> 02:26.310
by each activity, and the goal has been designated coordinator school, whose task is to assign duties

02:26.310 --> 02:27.590
to students, including himself.

02:27.600 --> 02:32.400
So see, there's a there's a lot of things going on, but none of them is important.

02:32.670 --> 02:35.760
The important part is just going to get none of this.

02:36.270 --> 02:37.830
The first paragraph is important.

02:38.460 --> 02:45.090
So the school rules say that no students can go three days in a row without any attributable to duty.

02:45.510 --> 02:46.650
Basically a.

02:48.580 --> 02:55.180
If you are doing as you read, you can't go three days in a row without doing eight.

02:56.450 --> 02:56.690
But.

02:58.390 --> 03:02.050
Nicole wants to find an assignment or a super w duty for himself.

03:02.080 --> 03:06.930
That minimizes the number of minute he spends overall on the day.

03:07.330 --> 03:07.990
Basically.

03:09.340 --> 03:12.010
Let's say we have these ten days later.

03:12.010 --> 03:13.660
We have these ten consecutive days.

03:14.140 --> 03:21.490
Let's when and I cannot go three days without a duty rate to basically in every three window.

03:23.190 --> 03:26.010
In every three window I have to pick up.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.490
At least one.

03:29.820 --> 03:31.320
Number eight out of these.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.880
I hope you understand this, but that means Indian.

03:35.880 --> 03:42.930
Let's see if I am if I am doing the first day duty and let's say I'm doing the this duty and then this

03:42.930 --> 03:50.370
duty, I was there to do some of the duty here to do some other duties, three plus two plus T, which

03:50.370 --> 03:51.610
is it?

03:52.190 --> 03:52.480
Eight.

03:52.950 --> 03:55.470
But this violates the condition.

03:55.470 --> 03:56.100
Which condition?

03:56.100 --> 03:57.570
This condition that is.

03:58.580 --> 04:02.390
That Uno student can go three days in a row without any due delay.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.900
That means here we can see the second day.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.260
I did not do the duty.

04:06.260 --> 04:07.670
In the third day I did not do.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.340
I did not go for the duty.

04:10.340 --> 04:13.010
And the fourth day also I did not go for other duty.

04:13.790 --> 04:18.200
So here I can see that I had three consecutive days in which I did not go for their duty.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.510
Well, this is not allowed eight.

04:20.690 --> 04:24.740
So in every three window you have to pick at least one element.

04:24.770 --> 04:31.640
Basically, it tries to say this that there can be no window of size greater than equal to three in

04:31.640 --> 04:33.500
which you have not picked up the duty.

04:34.390 --> 04:37.060
Well, I hope you understand this problem.

04:38.210 --> 04:39.620
So let's approach it.

04:39.890 --> 04:40.650
Approach it.

04:41.690 --> 04:42.140
Let's say.

04:42.140 --> 04:44.330
And what is the solution that I can apply?

04:44.780 --> 04:48.920
And before moving forward, also, let's find out the answer for this particular input.

04:49.220 --> 04:50.840
Some of you might have already done that.

04:51.230 --> 04:51.510
Right?

04:52.100 --> 04:52.570
So a.

04:53.560 --> 04:53.830
Cool.

04:53.860 --> 05:00.580
Let's approach, let's say a little design approach that I see I'm just discussing normally.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.360
That approach is very simple.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.600
Let's say for the first window, let's pick up the minimum element.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.230
So what's the minimum element you want?

05:09.250 --> 05:13.640
So let's I've picked up one and then I know I have picked up this one.

05:13.650 --> 05:20.220
That means in the next window after that one, let's pick up the minimum element again is going to be

05:20.220 --> 05:22.080
the best, best quality approach rate.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.630
Again, I picked up one now.

05:26.780 --> 05:28.190
I picked up these two runs.

05:28.550 --> 05:30.890
Now the next is in the next window.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.570
Again, pick up the menu element.

05:33.580 --> 05:34.230
So here it is.

05:34.240 --> 05:37.270
But why am I going over the next window of safety?

05:37.270 --> 05:39.100
Because I have to pick up at least one element.

05:39.490 --> 05:45.670
So instead of picking two elements, because that would certainly increase my sum, I'm just going to

05:45.670 --> 05:46.570
pick up an element.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.330
Well, again, I've got this one.

05:49.330 --> 05:55.510
And in the next window of this one, what I'll do is I'll again pick up the minimum element that is

05:55.840 --> 05:56.980
went well.

05:57.160 --> 06:01.600
So what his answer here goes as I can easily see if I pick up these four ones.

06:01.870 --> 06:03.730
One, two, three and four.

06:04.870 --> 06:09.340
There is no window of size three or greater than three, which is not picked.

06:10.090 --> 06:11.890
So this is two doing two.

06:12.640 --> 06:16.870
Of course, this is the final answer of the problem, which is four.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.490
So here we can see that this greedy approach works.

06:19.540 --> 06:20.440
What was the approach?

06:20.950 --> 06:24.700
Pick up the minimum element from the when first window of size three.

06:24.700 --> 06:25.090
Right.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.950
Let's I picked up the minimum element.

06:26.950 --> 06:32.920
And just after that minimum element, I began as the window of say, stripping the minimum again, the

06:32.920 --> 06:37.950
process so that it is in full.

06:37.990 --> 06:42.220
So here we can see that the approach worked.

06:42.790 --> 06:44.230
In that case, the approach vote.

06:44.620 --> 06:49.420
But what if, what if let's make, let's make a case where it doesn't work.

06:49.420 --> 06:53.110
And then I'll tell you how to distinguish between greedy and paid.

06:53.530 --> 06:56.440
What's my thought process on being really well?

06:58.010 --> 06:58.310
Yeah.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.300
So let's.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.720
Let's formulate our test case where the greedy approach won't work.

07:03.090 --> 07:03.410
Let's.

07:03.410 --> 07:05.780
Let's talk about this, too.

07:06.430 --> 07:09.620
To be too late.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.350
To let's say I have five days of SUV, double duty.

07:12.350 --> 07:13.190
And these are the.

07:15.020 --> 07:17.420
A number of minutes that I need to spend on.

07:19.010 --> 07:21.500
But tell me, what's the answer for this?

07:21.530 --> 07:24.350
What is the number of minimum number of minutes that I can.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.160
Spend on this particular.

07:28.530 --> 07:29.160
Problematic.

07:30.410 --> 07:33.560
So let's go with the deep rules that we applied to in the first three.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.700
Let's take the minimum.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.200
So here we can see minimum are two.

07:36.200 --> 07:41.360
So the best what would be the best way to pick up the minimum?

07:41.930 --> 07:48.050
Pick up the left most minimum moderate most minimum of course the right most minimum because in greedy

07:48.050 --> 07:54.920
also if I'm trying to maximize something, if I if I pick up the let's see if I pick up the leftmost

07:54.920 --> 07:59.630
to equal let's pick this up and what will happen the next window will start from this.

08:00.050 --> 08:01.940
Then again, I will pick up something.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.980
And then again I pick up this to.

08:05.750 --> 08:06.080
Bye.

08:06.650 --> 08:06.980
Okay.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.110
Now, this is the next window.

08:09.110 --> 08:10.160
No, let's pick up this.

08:10.610 --> 08:12.320
Well, the leftmost minimum.

08:13.010 --> 08:15.080
So again, we can see the answer here is.

08:17.580 --> 08:17.720
Right.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.020
But of course, this is not the correct answer.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.670
Eight six will never be the answer.

08:22.060 --> 08:23.080
And now let's see.

08:24.130 --> 08:29.500
Let's go with the second debate approach, which is if if two minimums are there with the same value,

08:29.500 --> 08:30.800
let's pick the right moment.

08:31.060 --> 08:36.820
Because in the end, what I have to do is I have to pick up at least one element right from that particular

08:36.820 --> 08:37.180
window.

08:37.450 --> 08:38.980
Why not pick the right most element?

08:40.900 --> 08:42.340
So let's pick the right element.

08:42.340 --> 08:45.400
And from the second window again, let's pick the right mouse element.

08:45.850 --> 08:48.430
And okay, so this is not the second window.

08:48.580 --> 08:49.410
Yeah, my right.

08:50.110 --> 08:53.560
The second window starts from here now because I pick that element.

08:53.860 --> 08:56.290
And now let's pick the right most element, which is the last two.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.120
So here the answer is two plus two.

08:58.540 --> 08:59.500
Which is what?

08:59.920 --> 09:01.060
But just think about it.

09:01.060 --> 09:02.440
Is this the correct answer?

09:04.550 --> 09:06.350
Of course, Garrity gave me this answer.

09:06.350 --> 09:09.720
Aid, which is poor, but I don't think it's a correct answer.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.010
Right.

09:10.980 --> 09:12.510
We can even minimise this.

09:12.510 --> 09:12.930
How?

09:13.500 --> 09:15.180
What if I just pick the military?

09:16.080 --> 09:16.820
It's just big.

09:16.830 --> 09:17.550
The military.

09:18.280 --> 09:18.760
And.

09:20.340 --> 09:21.080
This I.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.710
Let's say I have only picked up this tree.

09:23.730 --> 09:24.240
I just.

09:24.390 --> 09:27.660
I just went for the duty for the middle day.

09:28.290 --> 09:34.440
So here we can see that if I go for the duty of the morality, this part discovered, this far discovered.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.610
And this part is covered.

09:35.940 --> 09:37.770
All windows of, say, Syria covered.

09:39.110 --> 09:39.380
Well.

09:40.300 --> 09:48.520
So this is why the grid does not work always, because there's always a case where grid will fail.

09:49.540 --> 09:54.420
In dynamic programming, what happens is, how do I distinguish your ingredient?

09:55.000 --> 10:01.060
I'll tell you this Somebody Day will in some of the lecture, but I notice let's focus on how to approach

10:01.060 --> 10:05.650
this problem, because in every problem I'll be taking the example of a greedy approach.

10:06.400 --> 10:12.670
So when when we'll be solving like hundreds of problems in the upcoming lectures, then you can easily

10:12.670 --> 10:19.510
understand that why is greedy not working in ways only deep working some type of problems will.

10:20.110 --> 10:22.600
And of course, then we'll generalize it in the end.

10:23.780 --> 10:24.140
Great.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.620
But as we saw, Grady does not work.

10:26.630 --> 10:26.930
Right.

10:26.930 --> 10:27.410
So let's.

10:29.240 --> 10:29.630
Ignored.

10:29.960 --> 10:33.050
Greedy to know what can be your dynamic programming approach.

10:34.760 --> 10:39.800
I know we are just beginning this course and in the beginning of the course.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.180
I just want to tell you one thing.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.890
And just Gilbert Handy.

10:45.120 --> 10:51.060
If you're stuck in a dynamic programming problem, always start with one one element.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.110
The base case.

10:52.170 --> 10:55.050
I just make a base case in the unit case.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.840
Then add one element to it.

10:58.080 --> 10:58.920
Think about it in.

10:59.750 --> 10:59.930
It.

10:59.930 --> 11:02.450
What should be done to add one element to it?

11:02.810 --> 11:06.210
Think about it like, oh, what is the answer?

11:06.250 --> 11:06.530
Right.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.080
Basically start from a very small input.

11:09.080 --> 11:12.570
So what was the unit case for the base thing?

11:12.920 --> 11:16.160
If I want to be in an input here, it can be one.

11:16.290 --> 11:16.640
Right.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.700
But if there's only one and the.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.390
Let's see, the value is something, etc..

11:24.350 --> 11:24.800
Well, here.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.950
What is the best answer any one of you can?

11:30.580 --> 11:32.350
Think about it right on Saturdays.

11:33.830 --> 11:34.120
Right.

11:34.400 --> 11:40.490
But of course, in some problems it would be mentioned that led to and is greater than equal to treat

11:40.580 --> 11:40.840
rate.

11:40.850 --> 11:43.430
So let's take this constraint for us as well.

11:43.670 --> 11:49.520
If it's mentioned specifically that end is greater than equal to three, that means the length of the

11:49.940 --> 11:51.170
edit that's given to me.

11:51.350 --> 11:54.710
The days that I have is greater than or equal to three.

11:54.710 --> 11:54.980
Right?

11:55.100 --> 11:56.660
So now what will be the base case?

11:56.660 --> 11:58.730
The base case will be eight.

11:58.850 --> 12:00.140
So let's take any values.

12:00.290 --> 12:00.980
One, two, three.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.800
Now, what stands out to you for this particular.

12:06.650 --> 12:08.230
But what should be the answer for this?

12:08.240 --> 12:09.320
Three, one, two, three.

12:10.690 --> 12:10.940
Eight.

12:11.320 --> 12:11.950
It should be fun.

12:12.370 --> 12:13.290
If I pick this one.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.920
That means I've covered the first window.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.490
And of course this is Monza.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.190
And what if I add?

12:18.990 --> 12:19.770
One aptitude.

12:23.900 --> 12:26.070
But what what should be the answer in this case?

12:26.130 --> 12:28.470
So now here we can see we can have two answers.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.390
The first answer is one, one.

12:30.630 --> 12:31.810
I can pick these two ones.

12:31.810 --> 12:35.730
So it's only two, or I can pick up the middle two.

12:35.910 --> 12:37.410
It gives me total two as well.

12:37.990 --> 12:41.880
Two if I pick up the middle, do I get this and I get this?

12:42.210 --> 12:44.010
I cover all the windows of land.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.570
Three windows.

12:46.230 --> 12:46.590
So.

12:47.310 --> 12:47.580
Yeah.

12:47.880 --> 12:53.010
And then now what we do is we'll try to add another version to it and then we'll generalize it.

12:54.330 --> 12:59.220
So always when we lose, starting with our dynamic programming problem, this is just an introduction.

12:59.220 --> 13:06.780
So sometimes will feel like not I'm not a you know, you are not able to approach the problem in one

13:06.780 --> 13:07.230
go, right?

13:07.770 --> 13:08.910
Just remember one thing.

13:09.630 --> 13:11.190
It is never about beauty.

13:11.190 --> 13:15.090
There is no utility about enemy programming or what I.

13:15.160 --> 13:20.610
It is not to worry at all about enemy programming, whatever the story was that is that will be available

13:20.610 --> 13:27.330
which is an optimal substructure overlapping of problems dynamic programming state all that to I have

13:27.330 --> 13:27.930
already.

13:28.930 --> 13:32.410
Explained in the introduction to the program late.

13:32.920 --> 13:37.480
So we should so will not go into the Tory part ever again.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.610
So it's like mathematics.

13:40.510 --> 13:45.280
Mathematics has of a relativity and a lot of exercises and lots of problems.

13:45.700 --> 13:45.970
Right.

13:46.120 --> 13:52.450
So similarly, we'll go we'll understand that in programming, more episodic, more problems on it because

13:52.450 --> 13:55.540
there are so many varieties of problems involving dynamic programming.

13:56.950 --> 13:57.490
So let's.

13:58.730 --> 14:02.060
Let's figure out a good state of this dynamic programming problem.

14:02.530 --> 14:03.620
Well, let's see.

14:04.190 --> 14:04.390
Okay.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.200
I'll take this input later, then.

14:10.340 --> 14:10.910
And.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.130
Okay, let's let's work on this and put.

14:14.940 --> 14:18.500
Let's say I make a state which is, let's say, epiphany.

14:19.110 --> 14:23.580
What is if I means let's see if I can be.

14:26.370 --> 14:27.960
The minimum number of minutes.

14:28.770 --> 14:31.200
Minimum number of minutes.

14:34.430 --> 14:37.520
That's another case you saw there, a minimum number of.

14:39.630 --> 14:40.110
I mean it.

14:42.300 --> 14:42.810
Brent.

14:45.110 --> 14:47.510
And as should be w duty.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.030
Eddie from zero to I.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.620
It's considered that means if the first elements of the area are considered.

14:59.580 --> 15:03.870
Basically, if the if this this main square is considered, then tell me what's the best answer?

15:05.070 --> 15:05.520
And.

15:08.210 --> 15:08.870
But in this.

15:10.260 --> 15:14.400
And what we're doing is we are trying we are trying to consider the current days duty as well.

15:14.850 --> 15:20.820
Basically, what does it mean that if we if the duty ends on the current day, what is the best answer

15:20.820 --> 15:24.000
for the first heading and the duty?

15:25.580 --> 15:26.040
And.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.310
On the current day.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.770
So this is, of course, the first lecture.

15:32.770 --> 15:36.130
And what I do is I go very slow in this.

15:36.190 --> 15:42.190
They will go very slow here and I will solve this one.

15:42.190 --> 15:45.150
I just don't consider this input.

15:45.160 --> 15:50.340
Let's consider our input only, which was the input in which three D was not working.

15:51.800 --> 15:52.040
Well.

15:52.990 --> 15:57.580
Let's start with start with the first part and let's also remember what is ffi?

15:57.580 --> 15:59.680
FFI is nothing but the minimum number of minutes.

15:59.690 --> 16:07.510
Basically the answer if first the first few elements of the area are considered first elements basically,

16:07.840 --> 16:16.090
and the duty ends on the current day, which is and ends on the instead of current, let's call it 88.

16:17.110 --> 16:17.610
I do.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.410
So tell me what I should be.

16:21.190 --> 16:23.020
This is nothing but the indexing.

16:23.020 --> 16:24.520
Let me index it quickly.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.200
So I went to exit it very quickly and.

16:38.880 --> 16:39.450
This is.

16:40.020 --> 16:40.350
Yeah.

16:40.380 --> 16:41.490
So let's talk about this.

16:41.490 --> 16:42.110
Zero values.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.290
So this is FFA.

16:44.370 --> 16:48.870
So this is FFA adding let's call it daddy in which I will be filling the FFA values.

16:50.030 --> 16:51.260
Well, so.

16:52.340 --> 16:53.240
What is it for women's?

16:54.220 --> 16:59.710
If the current dispute is considered, then what's the best possible answer?

17:00.790 --> 17:07.150
If I talk about zero eight, which is the zero eight index, if I just consider the zero two days.

17:08.390 --> 17:08.700
Really?

17:08.750 --> 17:10.520
Only then what should be the answer?

17:10.670 --> 17:13.310
Because here I am saying that a duty ends on the side.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.860
That means I have to consider that I'd be in the duty.

17:16.910 --> 17:17.190
Right?

17:18.160 --> 17:25.520
So the answer should be too, because right now when I talk about zero, I'm not considering the rest

17:25.520 --> 17:26.050
of the area.

17:26.070 --> 17:29.750
I'm just saying starting first element is considered.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.670
So let's not get confused.

17:31.670 --> 17:34.640
Instead of zero, let's start zero by one.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.700
Because it can be confusing to a lot.

17:40.090 --> 17:41.170
Before the first day.

17:41.170 --> 17:43.930
And if I go on the first day, I go for the duty.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.240
Then what is the minimum amount of minutes?

17:45.970 --> 17:48.080
It is too late now, guys.

17:48.100 --> 17:48.550
Tell me.

17:49.060 --> 17:50.050
If only.

17:51.510 --> 17:55.560
It was off to size eight and I'm going on duty for the second day.

17:56.220 --> 17:57.450
What should be my answer?

17:57.810 --> 17:58.020
Just.

17:58.020 --> 18:00.810
Just consider this as the input opportunity, which is mine, too.

18:01.050 --> 18:02.910
And I'm going on the duty for the second.

18:03.930 --> 18:04.200
I.

18:05.110 --> 18:05.650
So here it is.

18:05.650 --> 18:06.220
Totally.

18:07.180 --> 18:07.340
The.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.750
Answer again should reiterate Why should the answer we do?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.400
Why should be the number of minutes prior?

18:14.940 --> 18:18.960
Because right now my edit consists of only first two days.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.540
As I said, it will start from one, right?

18:21.570 --> 18:26.700
And it will go to late in the first two days, if I only consider.

18:28.640 --> 18:28.910
Yeah.

18:29.060 --> 18:33.500
If in the first two days, if I only considered the two days only right then the answer should be do

18:33.530 --> 18:34.970
because I'm going on the second day.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.380
Let's talk about the third.

18:39.570 --> 18:48.030
So if I'm if I'm going on duty for the 38, that means now my input is kind of dead and I'm going on

18:48.030 --> 18:49.050
the duty for the third day.

18:49.050 --> 18:50.730
That means I have to include turning my.

18:51.910 --> 18:53.900
Meetings in demand.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.200
It means we should be there.

18:57.820 --> 19:02.410
And if this is the only input that means the all the windows of Sisu discovered.

19:03.190 --> 19:04.630
That means I cannot move forward.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.960
Now let's consider the fourth input.

19:09.950 --> 19:11.510
What about the fourth input right now?

19:11.510 --> 19:11.990
Let's see.

19:11.990 --> 19:17.840
I have this one, which is one which is 2 to 3 and two right now.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.330
I'm going on the fourth day.

19:20.060 --> 19:22.730
I'm seeing that I go on duty on the fourth trainer.

19:22.730 --> 19:25.730
Tell me what the best answer for all these four values.

19:26.270 --> 19:27.840
These when you do that, you are.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.990
Tell me, guys, if I go.

19:31.180 --> 19:32.620
Directly and floor today.

19:32.650 --> 19:33.740
Is this possible?

19:33.760 --> 19:35.530
Is it legal according to the problem?

19:36.600 --> 19:36.870
No.

19:36.870 --> 19:37.160
Right.

19:37.170 --> 19:42.120
I cannot keep any consecutive treaties in my duty.

19:43.050 --> 19:45.890
I hope you agree or you all agree with me on this point.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.340
So this is the case.

19:48.120 --> 19:55.680
If I go on the floor today and I include the full two days in demand so that I need to include the first

19:55.680 --> 19:59.250
day or the second day or the third.

20:00.280 --> 20:04.030
Eight and then include one editing you to edit include three.

20:04.390 --> 20:07.330
Include one to include two three.

20:08.460 --> 20:09.600
I include one three.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.190
But look, I have to.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.740
Include any of these possibilities.

20:15.980 --> 20:16.300
So.

20:17.270 --> 20:18.290
Just quickly.

20:19.980 --> 20:22.440
Going over it again, which is.

20:22.450 --> 20:23.390
Yeah, right.

20:23.550 --> 20:26.870
So I have to either go on the first day or, you know, the third day.

20:26.970 --> 20:29.950
That means if I try do on the first four today.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.630
What what are the choices I have?

20:32.640 --> 20:34.200
I have the first choice which is.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.410
Let me change the pen.

20:36.530 --> 20:36.720
Yeah.

20:36.750 --> 20:40.650
The first choice is after the third day goes on the fourth today.

20:41.070 --> 20:45.050
After the second day go on the fourth day or after the first day going to four eight.

20:45.360 --> 20:48.210
If I directly go on the four, it is not possible.

20:48.270 --> 20:55.200
So what I will say is I'm going on the fourth today and that I can go on the first day, then go on

20:55.200 --> 21:01.590
the fourth today, go on the second day, then go on the fourth today, go on third day or then go on

21:01.590 --> 21:03.330
the fourth day, basically.

21:04.390 --> 21:06.970
If before going on the floor today.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.270
What is this second last day that I went?

21:11.590 --> 21:14.740
The second last day here can be the first day that can be.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.190
Or the third it has to be this late.

21:17.830 --> 21:19.780
We have to take any one of these.

21:20.110 --> 21:20.330
Right.

21:20.650 --> 21:20.920
Okay.

21:20.920 --> 21:26.470
So tell me if I go on the first day and then I go on the fourth day.

21:28.050 --> 21:29.280
Then what would be my answer?

21:29.790 --> 21:31.830
My answer will be very simple, which is.

21:33.490 --> 21:35.800
The answer for the whole area.

21:35.860 --> 21:40.990
If I, if I burned on the first day, we just kept it one, if you remember.

21:42.220 --> 21:46.630
So I'm saying I went on the phone, I went on the first day and then I'm going on the fourth today.

21:46.810 --> 21:48.700
So it is equal to what you place.

21:49.820 --> 21:52.130
Do right, which is good.

21:52.580 --> 21:57.080
Now, secondly, if I'm on the second day and I'm going on the fourth today, because right now I'm

21:57.080 --> 22:02.540
just trying to make connections, trying to find note options that I have that I'm doing on the food

22:02.540 --> 22:02.840
today.

22:03.020 --> 22:04.220
That was the second last day.

22:04.220 --> 22:07.370
I can go on whatever is the second last day that I can go on.

22:07.850 --> 22:10.670
The second last day that I can go on should be the minimum.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.550
It should give me the minimum answer for the previous three.

22:14.150 --> 22:19.130
Whatever the minimum answer for the previous area, I'll just add or update it.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.380
And that will become the answer till for.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.730
But let me quickly write this.

22:24.730 --> 22:29.620
So again, if I go from 2 to 4, then it is to bless two, which is four again.

22:29.950 --> 22:35.910
And if I go from 3 to 4, that means the second last days, three and the last days four.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.390
That means it is two plus.

22:38.570 --> 22:39.680
Three, it is equal to five.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.520
Which of these is giving me minimum answer over here?

22:44.850 --> 22:48.240
Which which particular transition is giving me minimum answer?

22:48.570 --> 22:51.840
It is the transition from one or 2 to 48.

22:52.440 --> 22:58.770
If I go from one or two because both of them have the same values, I'm going to the photo.

22:58.770 --> 22:59.610
It will give me four.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.070
Well, so I hope you got this case.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.080
Why is the value four over here?

23:04.230 --> 23:08.700
Because as that, I can come from 2 to 4 or I can come from 1 to 4.

23:08.730 --> 23:09.900
This is important part.

23:09.930 --> 23:13.330
These transitions are the only part about any programming rate.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.570
So here what we are doing is we are trying to.

23:16.870 --> 23:21.640
I note that what is a minimum what is a minimum month for the previous three positions?

23:22.030 --> 23:26.400
Because after the previous revisions, I can come on the current rate.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.690
Now let's talk about the fifth.

23:29.950 --> 23:30.130
Okay.

23:30.400 --> 23:39.220
So if I want to come on the fifth day, right, that means that I come from the fourth today or I go

23:39.220 --> 23:44.600
after the third day or I go after the second day, but I cannot now consider the first day.

23:44.620 --> 23:45.430
This is important.

23:45.790 --> 23:46.150
Why?

23:46.630 --> 23:49.090
Why can't I consider this transition 1 to 5?

23:49.660 --> 23:50.230
Because.

23:51.350 --> 23:57.950
If I consider the transition from 1 to 5, then these two, three and four will be left.

23:58.550 --> 24:00.770
So I cannot leave three consecutive elements.

24:01.370 --> 24:04.400
I cannot leave three consecutive days in middle age.

24:04.400 --> 24:10.370
I have to I can't consider this transition, which is why I'm going from 1 to 5 that allows these fifth

24:10.370 --> 24:11.750
and the second houses.

24:11.750 --> 24:15.830
For us, it's not possible simply to go on the fifth day.

24:15.830 --> 24:20.870
What I have is I have the value of which is two plus eight.

24:21.260 --> 24:26.510
So okay, let's again take the same things last the fifth.

24:26.730 --> 24:28.370
Let's signalised again before it.

24:29.480 --> 24:35.060
Last is fifth, then second last week, and also with three and last days with the signals, they can

24:35.060 --> 24:36.110
also be two eight.

24:36.110 --> 24:37.220
So what are the values here?

24:38.180 --> 24:40.640
If last is fifth, the second last days fourth then.

24:42.220 --> 24:42.520
If.

24:42.790 --> 24:43.080
Okay.

24:43.450 --> 24:44.830
Do not tell me, everyone.

24:46.110 --> 24:49.560
What's the best answer for the whole?

24:50.580 --> 24:54.030
And that means was the best answer if I going forward today.

24:54.270 --> 24:54.780
Basically.

24:56.190 --> 24:59.300
What's the best answer if I am going on the floor today?

24:59.670 --> 25:00.150
Of course.

25:00.150 --> 25:00.600
For.

25:01.550 --> 25:01.850
Eight.

25:01.940 --> 25:08.180
It's not to remember this event going on 48 means the answer from the first date to the 48.

25:08.510 --> 25:12.280
I'm just trying to make a transition here that I'm going on the floor today.

25:12.290 --> 25:15.890
I don't care about where I am going on the floor today.

25:16.820 --> 25:19.820
Rate for the fifth index or the fifth index.

25:19.820 --> 25:23.480
I just want to know what the best answer that they can provide.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.640
They look for the fourth.

25:25.640 --> 25:30.320
It is four that 33 and the second is two.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.110
So if I'm going on the fourth today.

25:34.420 --> 25:35.590
I will take 4 minutes.

25:35.590 --> 25:37.720
If I go on the third day, it will take 3 minutes.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.750
And if I go on the second day, it will take 2 minutes.

25:40.780 --> 25:41.130
Right.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.450
So what is the minimum on them?

25:43.630 --> 25:45.480
Many among them is eight.

25:45.550 --> 25:51.190
So after this two, what I'll do is I'll simply add the current two, which is five to the 2 minutes

25:51.190 --> 25:51.840
of 15.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.710
So if I add them, it becomes.

25:54.800 --> 26:01.250
Morgan, I hope you are seeing these transitions from where are these values coming and what these values

26:01.250 --> 26:01.800
represents.

26:02.040 --> 26:05.960
The most important part of forming a state is an important part in dynamic programming.

26:07.010 --> 26:11.180
If you form a good state, then you can easily make previous connections.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.580
So here, what's my state?

26:13.890 --> 26:20.240
If I am going on the air today, if I'm going for the duty on the air today, then tell me what's the

26:20.240 --> 26:24.290
best answer from the first day to the 88?

26:24.860 --> 26:27.100
So here we have all the values.

26:27.120 --> 26:32.640
Now the five came from two and four came from either one or two.

26:32.930 --> 26:36.300
The is individual who is in Division one is in eight.

26:36.680 --> 26:39.200
So some of you might be wondering, how can one be individual?

26:39.890 --> 26:41.390
Why is the answer do it?

26:41.510 --> 26:44.320
Because it tells from us due to the first.

26:44.570 --> 26:45.500
What is the best answer?

26:45.860 --> 26:49.760
They will not tell me what should be the answer for all the five days.

26:51.090 --> 26:52.910
You did before that.

26:52.930 --> 26:57.040
Okay, I'm going on the fifth day and the best answer is for as we have seen.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.540
But it's not true, right?

26:58.840 --> 27:00.040
What is never the best answer?

27:00.430 --> 27:00.800
Why?

27:01.120 --> 27:01.660
Because.

27:02.810 --> 27:03.140
In.

27:04.810 --> 27:07.690
In the last three days I can.

27:07.690 --> 27:11.980
And on any of these serious raid it's not necessary to end on the 50 day.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.080
What if I am on today?

27:14.110 --> 27:16.700
If I are on the third day, I am.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.310
I should not go to for the day.

27:18.340 --> 27:19.900
I will also not go on the fifth day.

27:21.520 --> 27:24.860
It's not necessary that I will always be ending on the fifth.

27:24.860 --> 27:25.480
Today I can.

27:25.480 --> 27:30.460
And on the last day, last minus one day or last -38.

27:31.030 --> 27:31.330
So.

27:32.170 --> 27:38.350
In the end, what we have is the answer has to be the minimum of all these last three values, because

27:38.350 --> 27:45.730
at that I can finish the duty on the last day because it will think about all the windows of entry.

27:46.240 --> 27:51.760
Or I can finish on screen as the audit at last, but I cannot finish on the fourth last day because

27:51.820 --> 27:55.080
were trying to finish on the fourth last day.

27:55.330 --> 27:58.210
That means these three days will be worthless.

27:59.130 --> 28:03.090
But if these three days will be worthless, that it's not possible.

28:03.100 --> 28:03.290
Eight.

28:03.310 --> 28:05.280
I mean, it's not legal, basically.

28:05.980 --> 28:08.440
So what is a minimum among all these three?

28:08.590 --> 28:08.980
It is.

28:11.020 --> 28:14.050
What we have got is what the relation we are trying to form.

28:14.050 --> 28:16.000
How is this F of II being formed?

28:16.060 --> 28:17.590
Okay, let's go back here.

28:17.590 --> 28:19.180
Let's try to.

28:21.380 --> 28:22.880
Formerly this FAA report.

28:24.130 --> 28:35.530
This input to this is FFA, so FFA is nothing but it is equal to a minimum of F of I minus one.

28:35.530 --> 28:40.140
That means the I minus one is my second last year.

28:40.150 --> 28:49.750
If I'm going on the current d f of I minus two F of a minus three plus e is the number of minutes for

28:49.750 --> 28:50.380
the current day.

28:50.380 --> 28:55.020
Because I have to add the current day because that's what f I means if I'm ending on the current rate

28:55.480 --> 28:56.500
for the first three days.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.000
We know it's very simple.

28:58.360 --> 29:04.600
The first three days will have those values only now the fourth day is minimum of these three values,

29:04.600 --> 29:07.350
which is a minimum of 3 to 1 +18.

29:07.630 --> 29:09.650
But it will be give me two eight.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.400
And now for this particular.

29:14.740 --> 29:20.680
So now for the fifth day, what I have is minimum of these three values, which is one plus two, which

29:20.680 --> 29:20.920
is.

29:22.790 --> 29:23.850
The aide.

29:24.260 --> 29:27.840
Now, again, similarly repeating this further.

29:27.860 --> 29:30.320
Let me quickly let me quickly fill this.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.390
It is one plus two is three.

29:32.420 --> 29:34.970
Now, again, here, I'll get one to which is four.

29:35.330 --> 29:37.370
Now, minimum allows 3 to 2.

29:37.370 --> 29:39.300
Plus one is the pool.

29:39.740 --> 29:45.110
The minimum lost, it is three plus three, six, three, three plus two is five.

29:45.110 --> 29:48.440
And minimum lost to this three plus one is for eight.

29:48.440 --> 29:51.660
So these are the five values for all the ten days.

29:52.820 --> 29:55.010
By using this simple recursive relation.

29:57.300 --> 29:57.780
I hope.

29:58.870 --> 29:59.040
Yeah.

29:59.260 --> 29:59.940
Bernie Sanders.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.820
Now what should be my final value?

30:01.830 --> 30:03.340
It should be the minimum of last.

30:04.080 --> 30:06.000
What if I'm ending on some of the last three days?

30:06.000 --> 30:06.390
I don't.

30:07.560 --> 30:11.190
I don't have to consider what the left it in our aid it's already solving.

30:11.790 --> 30:14.280
Basically, I'm trying to make transitions here and.

30:15.670 --> 30:18.430
Well, let me try and connect you to this solution.

30:18.940 --> 30:22.430
The tree itself would save itself on this one.

30:22.450 --> 30:25.750
Basically, this two came from the second that I went on.

30:25.750 --> 30:28.980
The second day I heard it.

30:28.990 --> 30:32.560
I went on the third day and then I went on the 41 plus one.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.020
For this.

30:35.180 --> 30:37.700
Again, I have identified for this.

30:37.700 --> 30:38.570
Again, I have.

30:40.210 --> 30:41.110
Third and sixth.

30:41.350 --> 30:45.040
Now, this one comes from the 48.

30:45.650 --> 30:48.220
And let me change the color.

30:49.180 --> 30:49.780
This tree.

30:50.090 --> 30:51.270
So here we have six or eight.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.170
So this comes from a previous tree.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.690
Well, this two comes from.

30:57.040 --> 30:58.390
Again the minimum value.

30:58.390 --> 31:05.320
And then this one comes from again, this minimum value to these are the fees and these are the answers

31:05.320 --> 31:06.010
that are formed.

31:06.670 --> 31:12.820
I understand this how we landed on this, because if you listen to not all the lectures.

31:13.980 --> 31:20.490
Will be so explanatory because here I am trying to explain the basics of deep right, very basic.

31:20.710 --> 31:22.260
There's nothing more basic than this.

31:22.270 --> 31:25.230
And I was trying to I went on to do the gritty approach.

31:25.230 --> 31:30.630
Then we tried to formulate our particular state and then we try to connect those states.

31:31.120 --> 31:31.980
So it's starting.

31:31.980 --> 31:33.570
We are starting then reprogramming you.

31:34.140 --> 31:35.220
That's why it's taking.

31:36.270 --> 31:37.610
I would.

31:38.660 --> 31:40.040
So thank you, everyone.

31:40.400 --> 31:45.830
This is an input in which you should try the theory and see what the answer that you are getting.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.990
And in the next part will call it.

31:49.960 --> 31:50.470
Thank you all.
