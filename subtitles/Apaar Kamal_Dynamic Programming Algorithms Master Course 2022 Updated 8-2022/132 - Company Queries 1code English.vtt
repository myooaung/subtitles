WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:01.020
Right.

00:01.030 --> 00:08.200
So let's go to the binary lifting first and then we will see how to go to the second part of it, which

00:08.200 --> 00:11.530
is finding the gate box, which is very easy.

00:12.340 --> 00:13.750
We've already discussed that.

00:14.260 --> 00:16.990
But before moving to that, let me quickly called the.

00:18.290 --> 00:19.350
Binary eight.

00:19.400 --> 00:25.250
So with just two, if I wanted to take a do if I was one and let's take em, which is nothing but log

00:25.250 --> 00:27.140
be scared that I talked to you about, right?

00:27.320 --> 00:27.650
It is.

00:27.650 --> 00:28.250
Let's take two.

00:28.250 --> 00:31.610
And in this case, pull, for example, an upper limit.

00:31.730 --> 00:31.950
Right.

00:32.360 --> 00:32.900
But because.

00:33.930 --> 00:37.350
And Cross 20 or cross 19 doesn't make much difference.

00:38.160 --> 00:38.430
So.

00:39.500 --> 00:45.380
Let's take the input of the tree first and let's make a vector.

00:47.560 --> 00:53.470
Q And also, let me begin first.

00:57.820 --> 00:58.540
So I wouldn't.

00:58.540 --> 01:00.930
And what all other inputs do I have in the.

01:01.830 --> 01:02.940
But I have.

01:04.730 --> 01:05.120
Or.

01:05.130 --> 01:06.040
Q read lips.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.220
Let me read Q here.

01:08.410 --> 01:11.380
I will take two variables x.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.790
And by.

01:14.690 --> 01:15.550
And Stig.

01:15.550 --> 01:16.040
Excellent.

01:16.040 --> 01:16.520
Stig.

01:16.640 --> 01:16.910
Okay.

01:16.910 --> 01:17.240
Sorry.

01:17.670 --> 01:21.570
In this case, the input is not based on X and Y, right?

01:21.590 --> 01:22.880
It's only based on X.

01:23.180 --> 01:23.840
What is x?

01:23.990 --> 01:27.080
X is the parent of a let's call it parent.

01:28.190 --> 01:29.270
It is the parent of I.

01:29.540 --> 01:30.690
It's given to me.

01:30.690 --> 01:30.940
Right.

01:30.980 --> 01:33.230
And I start from two and go Still in.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.860
So the input here is a little different.

01:37.610 --> 01:40.760
So what I simply say is I just push back the current node.

01:41.940 --> 01:43.500
Into their decision to list off.

01:44.520 --> 01:52.850
I that is great and I do the vice versa also and independent I just push back I it's internet acted.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.930
Gottfried So here we are done with the input.

01:55.260 --> 02:01.770
Now what I want to do is I want to performer DFS and calculate of, let's call it spar stable or.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.570
It's called anything, right?

02:05.950 --> 02:09.340
So basically, this article supposedly was biometrics.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.320
These are the names for it.

02:11.830 --> 02:12.760
But I just call it.

02:15.250 --> 02:17.860
Parent or ancestor.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.080
Parent seems good.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.990
Also, you can call it up a leg.

02:22.990 --> 02:26.020
How much of you are going to let's call it parent.

02:26.590 --> 02:32.130
Well the parent of and Walmart to raise the D power g.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.070
Well, I hope you answered this so it will stall for every.

02:37.540 --> 02:43.420
For every northern visitor with its tourists devoured, jeered, spit, and they will go from zero to

02:43.840 --> 02:44.440
less than him.

02:45.510 --> 02:45.850
But it.

02:47.050 --> 02:51.940
So let's start at the office from one little spot, zero minus one, and it's bearing rate.

02:52.280 --> 02:58.750
So in this case, what I'll do is just to avoid this thing that is in the index I do doing one minus

02:58.750 --> 02:58.900
one.

02:58.960 --> 03:05.380
I want minus one to be happening in the index place of the parent area here.

03:06.330 --> 03:06.580
Eight.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.150
I don't want the minus one thing to be happening.

03:09.210 --> 03:10.310
So what then?

03:10.340 --> 03:15.240
What I'll do is I'll just initially take zero as an ultimate fitting date.

03:15.450 --> 03:20.430
And while answering the queries, what will simply do is if the answer is zero, then we'll just return

03:20.430 --> 03:20.910
minus one.

03:21.720 --> 03:21.910
Well.

03:22.860 --> 03:31.890
So let's say DFS and got ignored interfering node and let's perform the DFS.

03:37.230 --> 03:39.990
And you co-founded The Office.

03:39.990 --> 03:41.570
And what how do you do?

03:41.820 --> 03:44.820
If X is not equal to parent dfs x comma.

03:46.430 --> 03:49.050
Grand Canyon becomes the new eight.

03:49.670 --> 03:50.570
I hope this is clear.

03:50.690 --> 03:51.410
And we all know.

03:52.430 --> 03:53.660
Before we reached one naught.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.880
I wanted ancestors.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.290
We needed to be filled.

03:57.890 --> 04:05.840
Eight Because of the second part, which is f of whatever its ancestors, it's de minus one that should

04:05.840 --> 04:06.710
be filled already.

04:07.610 --> 04:10.430
That's what I do is I do the calculation over here.

04:11.270 --> 04:12.770
So let's start from Jake.

04:12.770 --> 04:13.700
What's two zero?

04:14.150 --> 04:18.590
And you will go till less than M and replace plus eight.

04:18.890 --> 04:20.810
And it's for the base case.

04:21.690 --> 04:22.760
The base gives a symbol.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.360
What is the current to this?

04:25.370 --> 04:25.940
To the power?

04:25.950 --> 04:26.690
The parent.

04:27.290 --> 04:29.210
It is nothing but pain that we are passing.

04:30.580 --> 04:30.880
Late.

04:31.760 --> 04:32.240
Now.

04:33.590 --> 04:33.890
Yeah.

04:33.920 --> 04:38.900
Let's start from one and let's see what is guaranteed to raise to the power.

04:39.030 --> 04:40.850
It been just nothing but.

04:42.370 --> 04:49.570
It's two days to the power j minus one spring that is current's day minus one period which was already

04:49.570 --> 04:53.020
calculated how it is already calculated because ten days equal to one.

04:53.860 --> 05:00.790
Then we warned parents zero two respectively with European and basically this current zero, which is

05:00.790 --> 05:01.290
already four.

05:01.840 --> 05:08.530
Then when do the equals 2 to 8 go for current to what we want this current one which is failed because

05:08.560 --> 05:10.690
Wendy was equal to one that was offered.

05:12.440 --> 05:16.100
We are failing the previous values in using that values to compute the for the values.

05:17.060 --> 05:22.940
So this will be paid in current day minus one and dooming whatever was its ancestor day minus one and

05:22.940 --> 05:24.440
two restricted by one day minus one then.

05:25.130 --> 05:31.820
We want it's two days to the power day minus one and system so that it can be current to restore the

05:31.820 --> 05:32.690
power dating system.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.540
So basically I'm doing a binary lifting here.

05:35.030 --> 05:35.280
Eight.

05:36.430 --> 05:42.010
So this is a normal record of religion, and we know that these values will be preferred because we

05:42.010 --> 05:43.000
are performing it over here.

05:43.620 --> 05:47.810
Do remember, if you write it, if you write discord over here, it will not work.

05:47.890 --> 05:48.160
Why?

05:48.190 --> 05:49.570
Because then what is happening?

05:49.570 --> 05:53.410
We are firstly moving to the leaflet and then calculating the answers.

05:53.740 --> 05:59.590
But when we are first calculating the answers from the lymph node, then we know its ancestors demeanors

05:59.590 --> 06:00.940
went well.

06:00.940 --> 06:02.110
You will not be fooled, right?

06:03.190 --> 06:06.840
This this area would not be filled in that case and will get wrong answers.

06:06.850 --> 06:10.150
So this is important if you perform it before performing the office.

06:11.770 --> 06:12.480
In this way.

06:12.480 --> 06:13.950
What we have done is we have in the.

06:15.250 --> 06:15.970
We didn't get it.

06:16.370 --> 06:22.270
Let me just print something just to check if we are getting some real answers or not.

06:23.080 --> 06:27.490
I'll start you from one to in and I'll see Dave will go from 1 to 3.

06:27.490 --> 06:27.910
Let's see.

06:28.890 --> 06:31.410
And 3023.

06:31.410 --> 06:33.630
And what I'll do is I'll just simply print.

06:34.630 --> 06:35.050
I.

06:36.060 --> 06:38.040
And it's present day.

06:38.550 --> 06:39.710
And let's bring.

06:40.810 --> 06:42.340
We didn't of idea.

06:42.340 --> 06:43.990
So I used just good spirit.

06:47.270 --> 06:47.470
Right.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.560
So here we can see oh one.

06:51.050 --> 06:51.680
G-Zero.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.330
That means what if it's two days to the power date period?

06:54.360 --> 06:55.370
That means okay.

06:55.410 --> 06:59.330
Instead of that, let me just say to comment you to make it more clear.

07:00.660 --> 07:00.900
Yeah.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.540
Thought it was for speeding zero or just for a second.

07:03.540 --> 07:04.230
We're in zero four.

07:04.230 --> 07:05.850
This one's for three in zero.

07:06.210 --> 07:06.720
That's true.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.560
What is true is once we enter this one U.S. brand is to lose.

07:10.740 --> 07:11.880
All brand is zero rate.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.440
So with the tree.

07:15.070 --> 07:15.480
This one.

07:16.450 --> 07:17.860
Now, let's talk about three.

07:17.890 --> 07:18.690
What is three?

07:18.730 --> 07:19.810
First one.

07:20.140 --> 07:23.260
The second button will be zero and restart.

07:23.620 --> 07:24.670
Fourth button will be zero.

07:25.270 --> 07:25.570
Pause.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.130
One button is three fourths.

07:27.460 --> 07:28.510
That can put into two.

07:29.260 --> 07:29.650
Correct.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.180
And fourth, fourth period is zero.

07:31.390 --> 07:35.830
Similarly, 4545152 and five 548.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.950
I hope you got this part.

07:39.370 --> 07:41.410
Now we want to find noted scared parent eight.

07:41.710 --> 07:43.690
So now let's take these cue queries.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.030
Let's do while cue minus minus one.

07:46.570 --> 07:54.700
We have kill it stick as an input and let's see out of give it parent.

07:55.640 --> 07:55.910
Eight.

07:56.980 --> 08:00.670
Or instead of Yeah, you get that and it will pass get to it.

08:01.210 --> 08:02.200
It's an it's basket.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.010
Do it and.

08:04.780 --> 08:10.000
It's like a function called give Kate, parent Kate over here and.

08:11.990 --> 08:14.240
What we will do is nothing.

08:14.240 --> 08:17.060
But we'll just start a loop and let's call it day.

08:18.720 --> 08:24.620
Both from m my again m minus one g greater than or equal to zero j minus weighted.

08:25.630 --> 08:29.430
So what I actually want to do is I want to divide gain two powers of two.

08:29.850 --> 08:31.170
I know how to do it.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.160
Gained powers of two.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.360
For example, k standard.

08:33.360 --> 08:40.170
It should be two blessed to find its second parent and then find its eighth parent or find its eighth

08:40.170 --> 08:43.350
parent and find its second parent board with the same rate.

08:43.470 --> 08:46.560
So I can start this G from zero also.

08:47.580 --> 08:48.660
They less than M.

08:49.840 --> 08:50.530
Joblessness.

08:51.380 --> 08:51.710
Correct.

08:52.750 --> 08:54.880
Find its true parent and find its.

08:55.810 --> 08:56.590
Some other period.

08:56.920 --> 08:57.790
I hope that's clear.

08:58.630 --> 09:05.770
Because if we do to blessed or was to both of them, I see it and let's see let's call in on single

09:05.770 --> 09:06.520
parent.

09:08.160 --> 09:08.790
We didn't.

09:08.790 --> 09:09.540
And he should.

09:09.900 --> 09:10.230
Let's.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.550
Let's initialize it.

09:12.570 --> 09:13.270
I'm.

09:14.260 --> 09:18.070
With the current value rate so indicative.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.500
I got two integers h.

09:19.510 --> 09:25.480
Sorry, but in this query I've got two integers which is zero komaki the first x10 and I also have two

09:25.480 --> 09:26.940
parsecs eight.

09:27.870 --> 09:29.670
Because we want a starting place, right?

09:30.760 --> 09:37.270
Well it's initially the parent is he goes to X and if gave will aid now will start from J will start

09:37.270 --> 09:38.170
from zero go to him.

09:38.170 --> 09:47.920
And I simply say if that bit of case said eight that means if gay rights if two times and one you all

09:47.920 --> 09:50.070
know about this raid because.

09:50.260 --> 09:53.130
Okay let me finish then.

09:54.290 --> 09:58.890
What happens is a five 1111 in binary it is written as one.

10:00.150 --> 10:01.170
The

10:01.410 --> 10:06.630
1101000000 rate.

10:07.410 --> 10:10.410
So obviously it is eight plus two plus one.

10:11.430 --> 10:11.830
So what else?

10:12.330 --> 10:13.800
If that did we dissect?

10:13.920 --> 10:19.000
That means take that element and take the 2 to 3 poverty rate.

10:19.020 --> 10:23.310
So if that really said, then I'd simply say we it is nothing, but it is equal to.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.340
The knot on which I was on.

10:26.340 --> 10:28.730
It's too late to devour Jupiter and eight.

10:28.730 --> 10:31.770
So I simply say, instead of waiting, let's call it.

10:31.950 --> 10:32.420
Got it.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.980
That would make more sense in this skit.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.530
But currently I on some particular note, I want to jump to it.

10:38.650 --> 10:46.810
Did you study -- parent religion by simply writing this current request to parent current committee?

10:47.350 --> 10:51.550
Now I move to summarize a note current has become to some of that, nor not even move forward and take

10:51.550 --> 10:52.270
for another set.

10:52.810 --> 10:55.340
If that were to say again, it will jump up eight.

10:55.630 --> 10:56.740
And finally, Elton.

10:57.700 --> 11:03.160
But now we know just one thing, that if current is equal to zero, then we currently will do minus

11:03.160 --> 11:11.440
one because we know we started with zero to be the ancestor of one eight just to avoid some minus one

11:11.440 --> 11:16.000
values in the indexes eight because that would give me some segmentation fault.

11:16.930 --> 11:20.220
So if current is zero, that means zero cannot be the parent of any node.

11:20.230 --> 11:23.350
That means current is equal to N and I just didn't care and let me build it.

11:25.630 --> 11:27.600
So what I got is three one minus one.

11:27.850 --> 11:29.530
So let me give slash in.

11:30.910 --> 11:33.930
So it is three one and minus one.

11:34.560 --> 11:40.330
I hope you understand this problem and this this binary lifting thing, which is calculating this vast

11:40.430 --> 11:41.010
matrix.

11:42.060 --> 11:46.800
And finding out the kids reading this will be using the next problem, which is.

11:47.810 --> 11:51.200
Company going is two in which we have to find the lowest common ancestor.

11:51.200 --> 11:55.050
So we will be able to find the lowest common ancestor in log of in age.

11:55.310 --> 11:56.870
So I'm not solving the next problem.

11:56.870 --> 12:00.930
I leave it to you because 95% of the next problem is done.

12:01.640 --> 12:06.200
If you ever understood this kind of thing, you just have to figure out a way to find out lowest common

12:06.200 --> 12:08.510
ancestors of two nodes, and that would be very easy.

12:08.780 --> 12:13.910
There are multiple ways of solving it in the graph to the algorithms cause I have mentioned five six

12:13.910 --> 12:15.230
ways of finding the LC.

12:16.460 --> 12:16.760
So.

12:18.460 --> 12:22.840
I won't be recording the next volume because it's very easy and the dynamic programming part of the

12:22.840 --> 12:28.360
Knicks world, which has already been covered in this problem and in this, could it go over this once

12:28.360 --> 12:29.980
and see in the next part?

12:30.140 --> 12:30.520
Thank you.
