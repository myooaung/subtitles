00:00.570 --> 00:01.260
Hello, everyone.

00:01.350 --> 00:05.490
So let's understand what is the history and what our baggage is?

00:06.060 --> 00:08.750
These are one of the most important topics of gratuity.

00:08.880 --> 00:09.170
Right?

00:09.580 --> 00:12.450
So DFT will help you understand.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.210
Harder trick to say get in a graph.

00:16.810 --> 00:22.060
It will also help you understand how to find articulation points in bridges because after this I will

00:22.060 --> 00:24.100
be discussing with articulation points and bridges.

00:24.490 --> 00:27.970
So I have to explain this right.

00:28.510 --> 00:30.790
Articulation points and bridges.

00:34.410 --> 00:42.750
And they will also like the if history and packages these solved maximum problems from graph.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.550
If you have a graph and I want to traverse it, I wasn't using the depth versus tree node.

00:48.570 --> 00:49.560
So let's understand this.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.210
It's very easy and it's.

00:52.770 --> 00:55.200
It's it's never, ever used trade.

00:55.230 --> 00:56.340
So it's used everywhere.

00:57.000 --> 00:57.320
Cool.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.440
Ever used.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.720
Now let's.

01:02.210 --> 01:04.430
Make a graph, a normal graph, a simple graph.

01:04.460 --> 01:05.000
So let's see.

01:05.000 --> 01:05.930
I have this graph.

01:06.530 --> 01:08.150
One, two, three.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.180
So we have already discussed what is our deposit rate.

01:12.620 --> 01:13.640
So here is some.

01:14.710 --> 01:20.980
Observation of the deficit so that it will help you in understanding water articulation points in bridges.

01:21.280 --> 01:21.610
Right.

01:22.060 --> 01:26.920
So guys, as the name suggests, the efficiency is actually obtained after performing a deficit on a

01:26.920 --> 01:27.330
graph.

01:27.340 --> 01:28.660
A very simple definition.

01:28.990 --> 01:29.290
Right.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.760
So let's perform the deficit on this graph.

01:31.790 --> 01:33.250
Let's start from Node one.

01:34.030 --> 01:37.120
So initially, I'm on Node one and we all know what is the deficit.

01:37.150 --> 01:42.240
It will keep going on here that the same nodes, if the node is not visited and finally return back,

01:42.250 --> 01:44.830
if there are no more nodes to visit made.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.890
So from one, I will go to two.

01:49.020 --> 01:49.470
From two.

01:49.470 --> 01:57.180
I can go to three now, guys from three I cannot go to one bye because this is the first such date.

01:57.540 --> 02:02.940
So we only performer the first search when the node is not visited, not visited.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.350
So if the node is visit.

02:04.620 --> 02:08.790
So let's see if you don't use this case that the Nord is visited, guess then what happens.

02:09.090 --> 02:10.220
I will do what I to.

02:10.230 --> 02:13.050
I'll go to three then again I'll go to one, then two, then three.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.430
One, two, three, one, two, three.

02:14.430 --> 02:16.740
And it will be like an infinite loop, right?

02:17.280 --> 02:24.540
So I, so we always see that we will, we will will only visit a node if it is not visited already.

02:24.540 --> 02:24.810
Right.

02:24.840 --> 02:29.940
So then we visit every node once and the complexity of definitely means often node.

02:30.060 --> 02:34.020
So goes will this edge that is between three and one.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.400
Will this edge be traversed?

02:36.480 --> 02:38.250
Will I read everything this edge to one?

02:38.280 --> 02:40.470
No, because I'm not performing this deep.

02:40.890 --> 02:41.970
I'm not going to one.

02:41.990 --> 02:42.270
Right.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.070
Because it is already registered.

02:45.440 --> 02:50.120
So this is an edge and I'll market with red for not wanting to.

02:50.820 --> 02:55.700
Now let's continue on to your this from I'm right now on three from three I'll come back to two.

02:56.060 --> 02:58.190
From two I have to go to four then.

02:59.730 --> 03:02.880
From four, I'll go to five, let's say from 5 to 6.

03:03.450 --> 03:06.090
From six I go to seven and from seven.

03:06.980 --> 03:11.750
I cannot go to Full Ride Bay because Fort is already visited.

03:12.170 --> 03:14.510
So again, I'll get to that edge.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.240
So what are these radius guys?

03:17.540 --> 03:20.840
These red edges are called back edges.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.130
What is the package?

03:24.460 --> 03:28.630
And as we're just pointing backwards, so from one, I go to two.

03:29.020 --> 03:31.060
Okay, let me open this.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.470
Electricity is back.

03:34.790 --> 03:35.180
Right.

03:36.760 --> 03:37.010
Good.

03:38.170 --> 03:38.510
So.

03:39.580 --> 03:39.970
So what?

03:39.970 --> 03:40.420
A package.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.270
This guy's an edge, which is pointing backwards.

03:43.660 --> 03:46.320
So from one I wonder to from 2 to 3.

03:46.330 --> 03:47.650
And again, there's an edge.

03:47.650 --> 03:51.430
But just taking me backwards to one because one is already visited.

03:51.430 --> 03:52.690
So it was somewhere backwards.

03:53.230 --> 03:54.580
So that's why it's called a back edge.

03:54.590 --> 04:00.430
It is it is an edge which will take me back, which is pointing back to we have a back is there and

04:00.430 --> 04:02.570
then we have a back here from 7 to 4.

04:03.820 --> 04:05.470
So, guys, no matter.

04:06.940 --> 04:14.020
From which location you start your DFS, no matter which location you start your DFS, you will always

04:14.020 --> 04:15.890
face fierce back edges.

04:15.910 --> 04:18.500
If there is a single integral, right?

04:18.910 --> 04:26.200
So as we can notice, as we can see that we will only phase back edges if there's a circle in the graph.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.680
So if there's no cycling aggregates, then we cannot place packages.

04:30.660 --> 04:32.870
They will simply keep on performing at DFS.

04:32.880 --> 04:33.840
There will be no entries.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.190
You'll be taking us backwards.

04:35.220 --> 04:38.340
All the ads will be taking us forward only to the new nodes.

04:39.020 --> 04:41.520
Hey, if it's a tree, then we don't have to bow.

04:41.850 --> 04:43.350
We don't get back ages.

04:43.350 --> 04:46.650
But if we have a package, that means there's a circle in my graph.

04:46.950 --> 04:51.990
Even a single package means that these are recycling the group rate because there are two parts from

04:51.990 --> 04:52.550
1 to 3.

04:52.560 --> 04:56.820
That is from I go from 1 to 3 and then from 3 to 1 using the package.

04:57.570 --> 04:57.860
Right.

04:58.320 --> 05:02.850
So if I remove these packages from my graph, let's remove these packages.

05:04.310 --> 05:08.750
From this graph, from this first traversal, what does this become, guys?

05:09.940 --> 05:11.790
It becomes too late.

05:12.010 --> 05:17.890
So this is a G if I remove the back edges because I'm not reversing on these back edges.

05:18.700 --> 05:19.060
Right.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.150
So it is called a DFC.

05:21.250 --> 05:21.550
Right.

05:22.210 --> 05:27.410
If I perform at the first edge on a graph and I get to the resulting, that I get is a tree.

05:27.890 --> 05:28.150
Okay.

05:28.580 --> 05:29.860
What is the resultant content?

05:29.890 --> 05:33.940
It contains all the nodes and edges which have been traversing the deposit.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.380
The edges, which does not mean there wasn't a deficit.

05:36.460 --> 05:40.510
I called back edges and which and then not included in my DFC.

05:41.080 --> 05:46.990
So what we can do here is we can start out this same DFS from some of the newer rates and it start it

05:46.990 --> 05:47.560
from four.

05:48.470 --> 05:49.520
So let's say Ford.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.870
From Ford, I go to five.

05:51.900 --> 05:58.650
From 5 to 6, six I go to seven and from seven I cannot go to four because four is already visited.

05:58.950 --> 06:07.390
So what we have got here, we have got the baggage clearance and then I cannot go to four.

06:07.530 --> 06:11.250
So from seven, I come back to six, come back to five, come back to four.

06:11.910 --> 06:12.960
And then I go to two.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.220
I go on two.

06:14.670 --> 06:16.860
So let's move this site two.

06:17.220 --> 06:20.640
Then I go to three, and from three I go to one.

06:21.770 --> 06:25.750
Now from one guy, there is this ad which is pointing to Bain.

06:26.420 --> 06:30.680
So if an ad is pointing backwards, that means it is already pointing to a visitor note.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.180
Then it's a baggage.

06:32.540 --> 06:36.460
I won't be traversing this particular edge style market.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.210
So from one, I'll come back to three.

06:38.210 --> 06:40.520
Come back two to come back to four and go back.

06:41.110 --> 06:41.290
Right.

06:41.390 --> 06:45.260
So this is a again, we can see that this is a DFS treat.

06:46.620 --> 06:46.950
Right.

06:48.590 --> 06:54.400
This is a brief history and as you can see, name without back ages.

06:54.410 --> 06:55.400
It is a day of history.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.950
So every graph has a day of history.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.610
They not only one be eviscerated completely depends on us.

07:01.880 --> 07:07.940
And then we start from the node number one or we start from new number four and or number five, whatever

07:08.000 --> 07:08.390
they are.

07:09.170 --> 07:14.360
We will always have a unique BFC made for each of the traverses c.

07:15.140 --> 07:17.630
There can be this second DFC also.

07:17.630 --> 07:22.190
That is it from one if I go to three instead of going to iterate.

07:22.190 --> 07:24.110
So I now you come to two.

07:24.110 --> 07:28.490
Now let's say I go to four, I go to seven, I go to six, I go to five.

07:28.820 --> 07:34.370
Now this is another D of history where the packages are one and two and four, then fight.

07:35.210 --> 07:39.920
So I hope we are getting the point here is that they can leverage the DFT.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.800
You can perform the first search in any way you want.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.740
We already to that in detail in the previous sections.

07:46.130 --> 07:46.520
Right.

07:47.210 --> 07:52.040
So the edges which are left are called back edges and these edges will be used.

07:52.100 --> 07:52.490
Right.

07:52.490 --> 07:54.170
So what are their definition of a package?

07:54.170 --> 07:55.280
What does a package do?

07:58.490 --> 08:00.590
Package is any edge, which is.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.040
Beckett denotes.

08:06.420 --> 08:07.560
Cycling McGruff.

08:11.940 --> 08:12.240
Right.

08:12.510 --> 08:16.020
So you will not have a because they're doing the right no circle in the street.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.520
So back as you noted, there's a cycle in the graph whose.

08:20.790 --> 08:22.380
And cool.

08:22.470 --> 08:29.310
So in the next video I'll be posting this out how to find packages and how to use them too.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.910
And after that, we will work a little on taking action on it.

08:34.230 --> 08:35.670
Although it's already been covered.

08:35.670 --> 08:42.500
But in this election, we will work according to our to finding our articulation, points and bridges.

08:43.140 --> 08:48.660
So we will learn some new tricks and techniques to discover sectors in the graphs.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.480
And then we will move on to articulation points on bridges.

08:51.780 --> 08:57.690
And then we will try printing outside using the graph to do the cycle in the graph, print one, print

08:57.690 --> 08:58.380
the whole cycle.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.730
So there are some good questions coming up.

09:03.270 --> 09:04.560
And stay tuned.

09:04.860 --> 09:05.790
Thank you for listening.
