Hello, everyone.

00:01.720 --> 00:02.560
lets solve again.

00:02.560 --> 00:08.230
And this is another next medium problem, which has has good likes and dislikes, so given a non-empty array

00:08.230 --> 00:13.150
nums containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into 2 subsets.

00:13.150 --> 00:17.680
Such that the sum of elements in the both subset is equal, so it is saying subsets.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.480
And it is not saying sub arrays right?

00:19.480 --> 00:21.880
And we have to partition it into exactly two subsets.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.330
So both of these subset should be equal to.

00:26.370 --> 00:29.750
Yeah, so the total sum should be equal to the sum of the the array right.

00:29.960 --> 00:34.760
And one subset sum should be equal to the sum of the array divided by two right.

00:34.910 --> 00:38.360
So basically, my problem converted.

00:38.360 --> 00:38.630
Right.

00:38.780 --> 00:39.400
So if the.

00:41.760 --> 00:48.060
If the sum of the whole array is odd, then the answer is not possible because you cannot divided into

00:48.060 --> 00:48.720
two subsets.

00:48.830 --> 00:49.050
Right.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.800
But if it is, even then what we'll say is, let's say sum by two.

00:52.950 --> 00:58.950
And now what I have to find is I have to find out whether a particular subset sum is possible with

00:58.950 --> 01:00.480
this particular sum, which is.

01:01.780 --> 01:08.220
sum/2 right so I'll just find for this array whether there is a subset equal to sum/2 

01:08.350 --> 01:14.890
or instead let's say total sum/2 might, if that is possible so that particular subset is.

01:17.560 --> 01:23.560
That particular subset is actually needed right and the others subset will be the complement of that

01:23.560 --> 01:24.880
subset right.

01:25.570 --> 01:26.800
So that's it.

01:26.890 --> 01:30.880
And I think you can easily solve this we have already seen subset sum problem in DP.

01:31.360 --> 01:31.720
Thanks.
