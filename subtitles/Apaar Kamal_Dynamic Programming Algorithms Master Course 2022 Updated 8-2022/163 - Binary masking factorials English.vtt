00:00.030 --> 00:00.330
Things.

00:01.290 --> 00:02.310
How it how I mean.

00:02.820 --> 00:04.770
Okay, let's dive a little deeper here.

00:05.170 --> 00:06.990
I'm including all the factorial things.

00:07.020 --> 00:07.470
Let's see.

00:08.030 --> 00:10.710
So this is made from 001.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.390
This comes from 010.

00:14.300 --> 00:14.600
Yeah.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.740
This comes from 001 and 100.

00:17.750 --> 00:21.470
And this comes from 100 and 010.

00:21.710 --> 00:22.090
Correct.

00:22.760 --> 00:27.740
And these all comes from zero only 000.

00:28.220 --> 00:29.780
Let me write three zeros.

00:30.740 --> 00:31.020
Well.

00:32.920 --> 00:36.910
So here you can see I'm adding the 0%.

00:36.940 --> 00:43.470
Here I am adding 5%, 0%, second percent, second person and first percent right now.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.710
Here after this.

00:44.710 --> 00:48.520
If I want to go to this particular mass here, I'm adding the second.

00:48.820 --> 00:53.200
So the first part here, I am adding this 0%.

00:53.590 --> 00:57.640
Here I'm adding, oh, I got I didn't 0%.

00:57.640 --> 01:03.880
I am reading the second percent rate and now here I leveling the 0% to this particular part.

01:03.880 --> 01:07.900
I'll be adding the first person and to this particular part, elevating the second position.

01:08.380 --> 01:12.040
Finally, I am adding this second person, first person and 0%.

01:12.610 --> 01:16.060
So here you can see if I could reverse any of these parts.

01:16.330 --> 01:19.300
So this is what Zero went to, correct?

01:20.690 --> 01:23.240
The leftmost bus zero went to this.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.220
But that is this one.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.860
It is nothing but 102.

01:28.760 --> 01:29.330
This one.

01:30.690 --> 01:36.120
It's nothing but a 0 to 1 rate and then just to zero one.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.790
Then it is 210 and then it is 1 to 0.

01:39.210 --> 01:45.630
So you can see in that again, I'm trying all possible permutations, right?

01:45.750 --> 01:51.440
It's just that I don't want to calculate these states twice, which is like, let's talk about this

01:51.670 --> 01:52.620
001.

01:53.650 --> 01:57.190
Combines with 100 to give me 1018.

01:57.340 --> 02:04.810
So I don't want any two states to be you know, come by computing twice I want.

02:05.650 --> 02:10.360
And here you can see I'm trying all possible factorial state so this is three factorial which is six

02:10.750 --> 02:11.650
all virtual options.

02:12.520 --> 02:18.430
So the day we realize this that how does it affect today's reduce to subsets.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.860
Will you get that answers eight.

02:21.610 --> 02:21.850
Yeah.

02:21.910 --> 02:23.740
Thank you everyone in the next part.
