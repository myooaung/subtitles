00:01.020 --> 00:01.740
Hi, everyone.

00:01.830 --> 00:06.790
So here is the most important part of death mask, right?

00:07.110 --> 00:13.710
So as we know that with mass, we convert factorial type solutions into to race to the power and depth

00:13.710 --> 00:18.060
solution basically and factorial will reduce down to two days to devour it.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.440
And how will this happen?

00:19.860 --> 00:25.020
So for this, we need to deep dive a little bit, but it's very easy to understand, right?

00:25.410 --> 00:30.510
So we all know that N Pictorial is always very, very, very great adding to this to the power.

00:30.510 --> 00:31.350
And why?

00:31.350 --> 00:37.350
Because, you know, to deal what's happening, it is one into two, into three into four into five

00:37.350 --> 00:38.040
and so on eight.

00:38.310 --> 00:39.840
But what about two destructive power?

00:39.840 --> 00:41.030
And it is always in two.

00:42.060 --> 00:45.060
So here you can see it is going into three into four into five.

00:45.510 --> 00:47.520
This is always going in to eight.

00:47.760 --> 00:58.890
So and factorial is a series which will be like, you know, going off in a very high more than exponential

00:58.890 --> 00:59.110
rate.

00:59.130 --> 01:02.700
So this factorial thing is we always say that exponential is this right.

01:02.700 --> 01:08.220
But factorial have this they have a higher slope.

01:08.640 --> 01:08.950
Cool.

01:09.450 --> 01:10.290
So here we can see there.

01:10.290 --> 01:14.310
And Vector is very, very eager to get into this power in, for example, 16 factory, right.

01:14.310 --> 01:19.380
So 16 for effect will be around ten is double 14 or 15 maybe I'm right.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.170
But what about rest of the about 16?

01:22.170 --> 01:23.880
It will be around to this ten.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.680
It's about four or five maybe.

01:26.220 --> 01:26.550
Correct.

01:26.550 --> 01:33.690
So you can see that the huge difference between factories and powers rate exponential.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.240
Let's see why this difference come in.

01:36.240 --> 01:39.870
How is the pivot bit mass working here?

01:39.870 --> 01:40.230
Right.

01:40.470 --> 01:41.550
So this is important.

01:41.550 --> 01:46.380
If you can this this will help you a lot in future problems that will solve.

01:46.740 --> 01:52.080
So it you can see I am writing a number called 16 sorry, 15.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.420
So this is a binary of 15, right?

01:54.750 --> 01:57.750
So if this is a binary of 15, how can this 15 be made?

01:58.290 --> 02:02.190
This 15 can come from in 0111.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.840
That means I add the last one.

02:03.840 --> 02:04.020
You.

02:05.030 --> 02:05.420
Correct.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.990
Dystrophin can be made from 101.

02:08.990 --> 02:15.380
One can be made from 1101 and also can be made from 1110.

02:15.770 --> 02:16.120
Correct.

02:16.310 --> 02:19.700
That means I'm just removing one one of the 16.

02:19.910 --> 02:26.480
So how many different possibilities I have if I remove just one one of the 16, I leave all possibilities

02:26.750 --> 02:27.800
later here.

02:27.800 --> 02:33.100
I'm just multiplying things by four because it has four, which I'm removing each once.

02:33.590 --> 02:36.050
Now similarly, just remove their bits by one.

02:36.260 --> 02:37.700
So I let three possibilities.

02:38.030 --> 02:42.860
That is 00110101 and 0110.

02:43.010 --> 02:43.400
Correct.

02:43.730 --> 02:47.630
Similarly for this, what we will have will have 0011.

02:50.010 --> 02:55.440
The second one will be 1001 and third one will be 1010.

02:55.830 --> 02:59.250
Similarly, we'll have three possibilities for this and three possibilities for this.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.620
Each I'm not listing all of them.

03:02.670 --> 03:07.740
Now, here you can see I have multiplied the number of branches by three.

03:08.010 --> 03:09.570
That means from 16.

03:09.570 --> 03:11.150
I came to four different numbers.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.780
Then I came to three different.

03:13.650 --> 03:15.960
So it is four and two, three, 12.

03:15.990 --> 03:18.300
Rachel here you can see, will have 12 different states.

03:19.170 --> 03:19.530
Correct.

03:19.920 --> 03:24.140
Now, let's further break it down to just break down two of them.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.430
Or if needed, we can be more also.

03:29.390 --> 03:29.750
Okay.

03:29.900 --> 03:35.960
So here you can you will see that these guys, all these guys will have a little bit to trade.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.300
So if they're only two bits we just said.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.140
So I'll just get.

03:40.120 --> 03:40.960
Two different parts.

03:41.200 --> 03:45.670
If I just remove one from them so I get 00010010.

03:46.180 --> 03:50.230
Similarly for this one delegate zero, I'll get only two, not three.

03:51.260 --> 03:51.530
Yeah.

03:51.950 --> 03:55.820
00100100.

03:56.510 --> 03:56.960
Correct.

03:57.170 --> 04:01.910
Similarly, some fuel for this also will will have to for all of them.

04:02.570 --> 04:02.930
Correct.

04:04.070 --> 04:08.540
And let me just add, I did 0010 and 1000.

04:08.840 --> 04:09.160
Cool.

04:09.560 --> 04:16.810
So here there's an important thing that I want to show you, that there are some states which are rebuilding.

04:17.630 --> 04:19.430
You can easily see that right here.

04:19.450 --> 04:24.800
And so you will see that there are some states which are repeating, I'm removing first and then I'm

04:24.800 --> 04:26.570
removing second bit.

04:26.750 --> 04:27.170
Right.

04:27.170 --> 04:31.310
Or I remove the second word and then I remove the phosphate.

04:31.550 --> 04:32.750
Both of them are same rate.

04:34.050 --> 04:35.100
Just the automakers.

04:35.550 --> 04:35.910
Correct.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.860
So that's what's happening here.

04:38.070 --> 04:41.040
So instead of any victory, we are going to restore the power.

04:41.040 --> 04:41.580
And how?

04:41.940 --> 04:45.830
Because here you can see we have tried four different possibilities.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.820
Here we are tried three different possibilities.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.770
Here we have tried two different possibilities.

04:49.770 --> 04:53.490
And later we will try one different possibility that there is nothing.

04:53.490 --> 04:55.920
But if I remove their bridge, they all will end up to zero.

04:56.580 --> 04:56.880
Right?

04:57.360 --> 04:58.200
So they have.

04:58.230 --> 04:59.250
So what is this?

05:00.150 --> 05:00.630
This is.

05:02.010 --> 05:02.880
Or factorial.

05:04.650 --> 05:05.010
Correct.

05:05.370 --> 05:10.380
So here you can see I'm trying all possible possibilities, which are all for bacterial possibilities.

05:10.650 --> 05:12.690
But there are some states which are attributing.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.520
Rebuilding states.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.800
And what is this thing called?

05:18.190 --> 05:19.830
Overlapping sub problems?

05:19.870 --> 05:20.290
Correct.

05:22.410 --> 05:24.120
So just you tell it.

05:24.120 --> 05:24.990
How many?

05:25.960 --> 05:30.070
How many different states are there total in this?

05:30.820 --> 05:31.120
Three.

05:32.050 --> 05:33.370
How many different states are there?

05:33.370 --> 05:33.880
Industry?

05:34.540 --> 05:37.600
I'm starting from 16 and I'm always moving.

05:39.330 --> 05:39.830
One bit.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.880
It means I'm moving towards zero.

05:41.880 --> 05:42.180
Right?

05:42.450 --> 05:47.360
So the number of states, the total states will be from 0 to 50.

05:48.240 --> 05:48.600
Correct.

05:49.170 --> 05:50.580
So how many states are there?

05:51.180 --> 05:53.550
How many distinct how many unique states are there?

05:54.240 --> 05:57.360
There are two Race to the power and states from 0 to 50.

05:57.840 --> 05:58.200
Correct.

05:58.380 --> 06:03.710
So if there are only two race to the power and states, that means if our memories all these states,

06:03.720 --> 06:05.670
that means I don't calculate them again and again.

06:05.670 --> 06:09.870
That means I memorize four overlapping problems.

06:10.140 --> 06:10.470
Right.

06:10.680 --> 06:15.960
Because you can see that the three of 0011 or the 0011.

06:16.230 --> 06:16.800
This tree.

06:17.920 --> 06:23.170
Will it be same for both these values because they're the same value and I'm removing the ones I'm trying

06:23.170 --> 06:24.490
out all different possibilities.

06:24.730 --> 06:27.150
So if I'm with them, I will not be calculating.

06:27.160 --> 06:32.860
All in Victorian states I'll be only calculating to raise the dividend state because there are two reasons

06:32.860 --> 06:34.120
about investing states.

06:35.050 --> 06:35.430
Correct.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.640
So the tree is going in Victoria, but the listing states that.

06:41.050 --> 06:42.060
Doing is pretty boring.

06:42.630 --> 06:48.210
So this was very important to understand and this is actually what's happening from the beginning of

06:48.210 --> 06:52.290
the course state that we now have many states, but with few memories.

06:52.290 --> 06:57.000
It will reduce the state because the number of unique states are are less good.

06:57.450 --> 06:58.710
So thank you, everyone.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.710
Look in the next part of this section.
