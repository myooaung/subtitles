WEBVTT

00:00.510 --> 00:00.740
Yep.

00:00.810 --> 00:02.100
Let's begin with the code.

00:02.100 --> 00:03.990
And I already done this.

00:04.530 --> 00:05.910
We have taken the solution.

00:06.690 --> 00:07.980
Scoby, based from here.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.970
Laceration solution rate and.

00:12.170 --> 00:13.260
Wilson, please.

00:13.670 --> 00:16.040
This is Max profit getting key.

00:16.070 --> 00:17.270
We are getting pricey, Larry.

00:17.270 --> 00:20.180
And I'm just taking it taken as an example, too.

00:20.180 --> 00:25.040
And the example in this check whether our solution gives us a correct answer or not.

00:25.550 --> 00:26.660
Let's quickly call it.

00:26.900 --> 00:29.450
And these are the reconciliations that we'll use.

00:30.260 --> 00:30.850
So, yeah.

00:33.170 --> 00:33.830
In Italy.

00:34.040 --> 00:34.330
Okay.

00:34.340 --> 00:39.470
So let's say 2010 some DB and I initially let okay, let me write DP first.

00:40.890 --> 00:42.780
I come by?

00:43.000 --> 00:43.290
Come.

00:47.430 --> 00:51.510
Yeah, the next one can be gay and the third one can be lasting.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.740
And we prices vector right.

00:54.150 --> 00:54.630
Prices.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.680
It just property prices at this rate.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.320
And this will tell me something called handsome pool.

01:01.590 --> 01:03.120
So now let's fill the biscuits.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.950
Initial guesses there is zero.

01:04.980 --> 01:06.300
We are starting from using index.

01:06.570 --> 01:13.080
Initially I want to buy it so I just mean by equals to true here will be parsed as it is and the prices

01:13.090 --> 01:15.380
vector should be passed as it is it.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.800
So what's the first case that I'm doing if I'm not doing anything?

01:21.760 --> 01:22.340
Don't.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.770
I can wait.

01:25.150 --> 01:25.870
I'm not doing anything.

01:25.870 --> 01:27.940
Or I'll simply say that and say, okay, I press one.

01:27.970 --> 01:33.700
The other states remain as it is and just past the crisis after the next one is.

01:34.420 --> 01:36.490
If I want to buy it.

01:36.580 --> 01:38.440
If I want to buy, the buy should be true.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.690
And I should have this limit of transactions.

01:43.230 --> 01:45.900
And that means I'm performing a transaction here.

01:46.290 --> 01:51.030
So maybe before moving forward, because this case is valid for both buy and sell, what I can say is

01:51.030 --> 01:53.520
if case equals to zero, I'll simply return back.

01:54.610 --> 02:00.180
So if gays zero, I can not buy and I can never sell because if gays zero, that means the Bible is

02:00.180 --> 02:00.630
not true.

02:01.030 --> 02:01.170
Eric.

02:02.300 --> 02:05.290
Badges are done there so that we don't have to worry about gay anymore.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.990
Now, gay will be greater than greater than equal to one.

02:09.100 --> 02:16.240
So if answer if I'm going to bite, then what it becomes, it becomes price is I plus dp i plus one.

02:17.400 --> 02:24.420
I have bought it, so now I will become false and it will be as it is and prices will be.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.510
So I will only make one transaction when I'm selling it.

02:27.970 --> 02:30.330
If buy was not true, that means I am selling it.

02:31.050 --> 02:32.070
So let me sell it.

02:35.750 --> 02:36.110
Okay.

02:36.110 --> 02:43.010
So this is prices because I'm selling your time getting some money I just added and from my bliss one

02:43.010 --> 02:47.510
from the remaining it'll tell me if I want to buy now because I want it now.

02:47.510 --> 02:52.010
I'm on a buying spree that I want to pay and the transactions have reduced by one.

02:55.730 --> 02:59.390
Because when I'm selling a stock, they didn't have already bought it.

02:59.390 --> 03:01.850
So the whole transaction is happening over here.

03:02.090 --> 03:03.530
So let's write some businesses.

03:04.850 --> 03:05.780
What's the basis?

03:05.990 --> 03:06.380
If.

03:07.700 --> 03:12.410
If it reaches the end, it is prices or stays.

03:14.210 --> 03:22.220
Then simply return zero because now I have an empty area and I can never buy or sell in that as in zero

03:22.820 --> 03:23.090
eight.

03:23.690 --> 03:25.760
Otherwise yeah.

03:25.910 --> 03:28.710
Otherwise I think everything else is full.

03:29.670 --> 03:30.450
They all.

03:30.540 --> 03:33.280
Also, we have made this case for gay men.

03:33.320 --> 03:39.210
Case zero I will never by normal that means I don't have to worry about gay anymore.

03:40.470 --> 03:45.240
But I do remember this case should be below this first case.

03:45.780 --> 03:46.140
Why?

03:46.350 --> 03:50.370
Because the first cases I'm not buying or selling so gay doesn't.

03:50.520 --> 03:50.940
So the.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.480
I can skip any number of elements to the end.

03:54.490 --> 03:55.500
Eight eight.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.670
So this was one problem.

03:57.670 --> 04:02.560
And now the second part of it is, let's say I just I'm just giving you some follow problems.

04:03.070 --> 04:07.250
What if it was written that you completed at most grade on the exchange rate?

04:07.270 --> 04:12.490
But what if it said, instead of seeing at most cadence the actions it said exactly.

04:12.490 --> 04:13.270
Grade on the actions.

04:13.660 --> 04:18.330
Then you have to do exactly get on the exams and tell me what is the best value in there.

04:18.340 --> 04:21.670
In that case, what you could have done is you could have said that.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.210
In the base case when leaving.

04:24.230 --> 04:29.330
What we would have done is if all the kid and the kids were used, then I would have returned something

04:29.330 --> 04:29.930
like zero.

04:29.960 --> 04:36.290
Otherwise I would have written something very negative so that it doesn't affect my fans.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.420
I hope that's very clear.

04:38.720 --> 04:42.200
If it is exactly clear, then the base case will only change.

04:42.710 --> 04:42.940
Eight.

04:44.700 --> 04:45.030
Cool.

04:45.760 --> 04:46.470
So

04:49.140 --> 04:51.030
let's build it quickly.

04:52.460 --> 04:52.730
Okay.

04:52.730 --> 04:54.050
So we are getting seven.

04:54.470 --> 05:00.200
And the complexity of this solution right now is a it's a recursive solution, but let's memorize it

05:00.200 --> 05:00.920
very quickly.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.390
It's take memo.

05:03.660 --> 05:07.320
And okay so I is what is the con.

05:07.860 --> 05:09.810
It's so prices landed.

05:09.810 --> 05:18.210
Housing is under dollars 2001 and five will be the true or false and.

05:19.660 --> 05:22.300
He's hungry, so I've just taken all of them.

05:25.210 --> 05:26.020
Memo said.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.350
Memo minus once.

05:28.390 --> 05:29.950
I love memo.

05:31.340 --> 05:34.600
And yeah, it's very.

05:36.050 --> 05:36.700
It's memory.

05:37.610 --> 05:39.710
So if my memo I buy.

05:42.190 --> 05:45.880
It is not equal to minus one written memo.

05:46.980 --> 05:52.050
I buy and it doesn't even bounce.

05:52.050 --> 05:56.660
It will never go negative because I have more scared on the extremes to do it.

05:56.670 --> 06:03.900
If I if I had to segregate on the actions, the answer could have been negative eight because now the

06:03.900 --> 06:05.370
transactions are compulsory.

06:05.770 --> 06:08.580
So I have to go in laws editing.

06:10.520 --> 06:10.820
Cool.

06:11.060 --> 06:14.120
And this will be copied.

06:14.120 --> 06:14.660
Paste.

06:16.990 --> 06:19.570
So that's the workings of the chain of events in the next part.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.330
Let's see some other partitioning problems.
