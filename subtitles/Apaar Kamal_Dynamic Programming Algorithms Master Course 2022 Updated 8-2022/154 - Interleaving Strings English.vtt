00:00.670 --> 00:03.240
Everyone lets in this problem.

00:04.310 --> 00:06.260
And it is another interesting problem.

00:07.470 --> 00:11.730
And right now, you can alone solve this problem.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.500
You don't need my help in this.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.440
And get into this deposit.

00:16.650 --> 00:17.820
Try to think about it.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.860
Lead good into living strength.

00:22.090 --> 00:27.610
And while this problem and apply to record hiring maybe you'll face this problem on.

00:28.650 --> 00:32.580
So it's this your instincts as well as to history?

00:33.360 --> 00:38.250
I mean, whether history is formed by an interleaving of as one and what is interleaving.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.340
We we have seen that the strategies are needed.

00:42.220 --> 00:43.860
So in the leaving means.

00:45.650 --> 00:52.700
Take one, leave off one scene takes a leave of seconds things and those evening do that means make

00:52.700 --> 00:58.310
it a chain which passes through both the things and finally give me a final string.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.230
For example, this case.

01:00.230 --> 01:00.480
Right.

01:00.860 --> 01:03.530
That means ABC.

01:03.590 --> 01:05.840
Okay, I've already written this.

01:06.590 --> 01:08.260
So this is a tune.

01:09.050 --> 01:10.190
So initially we have a.

01:11.040 --> 01:11.860
That crazy.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.190
Curtis.

01:14.240 --> 01:14.510
He.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.020
Romney we go back to be.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.500
From this bee, we go back to this bee.

01:22.610 --> 01:23.870
Then we go to this P.

01:25.230 --> 01:25.560
Okay.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.630
The week is not a right now.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.760
After this, B, we go to see.

01:31.490 --> 01:37.400
I mean you can see that it's a gene we are interleaving both these things for later financing.

01:38.480 --> 01:42.680
So we go to the see and now after see we come back to be.

01:43.900 --> 01:44.350
After this.

01:44.350 --> 01:47.560
B We go to the sea and we go to this.

01:48.010 --> 01:49.630
E And then we go to this.

01:50.320 --> 01:50.890
B finally.

01:51.180 --> 01:55.310
So you can see it's A, but it's B, it's just formed by both the strings.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.820
So it's kind of making a chain.

01:58.860 --> 02:01.000
Now it is kind of interleaving or distinct.

02:01.330 --> 02:07.540
I hope you understood it, but there are only two options b or we always have added to take the character

02:07.540 --> 02:08.050
from the.

02:09.270 --> 02:10.140
Being this art.

02:10.260 --> 02:13.260
The character from the painting and assisting.

02:14.730 --> 02:15.890
Let's see you.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.120
This is thing you hate.

02:18.150 --> 02:20.040
And yeah, as well as to history.

02:20.790 --> 02:23.710
So this is one of the examples.

02:24.090 --> 02:26.550
Some of you might be wondering, then why don't we apply radio?

02:26.550 --> 02:28.740
We're hearing they're just obligatory.

02:28.740 --> 02:29.220
Bye bye.

02:29.220 --> 02:31.710
Goodbye is for them.

02:31.710 --> 02:32.400
I have this case.

02:34.480 --> 02:39.430
So here what happens is let's say I use the video games over here and games over here.

02:39.990 --> 02:47.350
So, of course, you know, if I'm going to fill the card value, I have to either pick as one IP or

02:47.350 --> 02:48.400
S2 D.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.690
I don't have any other option.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.360
I cannot pick this before I pick this.

02:52.450 --> 02:55.150
Right, because then it won't be intelligent.

02:55.570 --> 02:57.010
Basically, the order matters here.

02:58.160 --> 02:58.390
Well.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.560
So, yeah.

03:00.590 --> 03:01.990
So this is S1.

03:02.570 --> 03:04.150
It says S two.

03:04.430 --> 03:07.520
And this is S3 S3.

03:07.730 --> 03:08.060
Okay.

03:08.720 --> 03:16.580
The value there is on S3 dead index will either be the value in S1, either NICS or the well-known S2

03:17.360 --> 03:17.720
index.

03:18.360 --> 03:23.450
It can be this or there's no other possibilities possible.

03:23.690 --> 03:25.190
Initially is in CAS zero.

03:25.190 --> 03:26.900
Let's see what will happen.

03:27.020 --> 03:27.170
US.

03:27.950 --> 03:28.430
Let's see.

03:28.760 --> 03:29.120
Okay.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.590
So what is as tricky?

03:30.620 --> 03:31.310
It is here.

03:31.670 --> 03:36.280
So I can only take S1 right now because that is only equal to the.

03:36.290 --> 03:37.330
Let me increase I.

03:38.470 --> 03:40.080
And we'll also increase key.

03:42.170 --> 03:47.480
Now, again, as money is equal to a strike rate, we don't have any other option.

03:47.480 --> 03:50.990
We cannot take a strike not because it is equal to the rate.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.880
Now I is over here.

03:52.970 --> 03:53.990
She comes over here.

03:54.260 --> 03:58.730
Now we can see that strike is equal to as to day.

03:59.210 --> 04:02.310
Now we cannot guess when I in this case because it is B eight.

04:02.540 --> 04:06.410
So we can only take B, which is as to real increment you.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.710
And incrementally.

04:10.220 --> 04:15.770
So you can see the dusting that is going behind that is already forming the previous string.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.090
Well, right now I'm going.

04:18.300 --> 04:18.750
I'm going.

04:18.750 --> 04:19.140
Really?

04:19.350 --> 04:21.210
If I'm able to form it, just form it.

04:21.540 --> 04:25.230
Right now we're here on B, B, right?

04:25.740 --> 04:26.760
No, we have two options.

04:27.390 --> 04:29.170
Now, here it is by greedy.

04:29.190 --> 04:29.880
Won't always work.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.530
Right there we have two options.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.200
Tell me, which B should I take?

04:35.420 --> 04:39.280
If you would say take S1 B, then why not ask Toby?

04:39.710 --> 04:41.180
And if your test was B, then Vinod.

04:41.180 --> 04:48.380
S once b because he lets c I take S2 as B for this, then I'm taking this.

04:48.380 --> 04:51.920
B then simply they will move forward.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.800
And we will also move forward.

04:56.890 --> 04:58.630
Now let's say I'm taking this be.

04:59.610 --> 05:00.960
Same thing will happen then.

05:00.970 --> 05:01.990
Okay, we'll move forward.

05:03.230 --> 05:06.500
Now Jay-Z and Jay-Z, tell me one thing.

05:07.130 --> 05:14.360
S1 I is equal to B you can easily see various as du jour is equal to the.

05:14.690 --> 05:21.680
But as to the case now equal to C on the other s when I is equal to as tricky not as today's equals

05:21.680 --> 05:22.700
to s t that means.

05:23.940 --> 05:26.310
If I have only this string.

05:31.070 --> 05:34.680
And that means now we cannot form the rest of this thing.

05:34.910 --> 05:37.070
We cannot farm this by using only this river.

05:37.550 --> 05:38.830
Because I need sea first.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.940
But I have biotic aid.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.860
So this is not possible.

05:44.060 --> 05:44.360
Right.

05:44.930 --> 05:47.540
So in this case, BP comes in.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.370
That means now we have options.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.480
If we have options, then.

05:51.610 --> 05:52.960
It's very simply we have options.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.600
We have to try both ways.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.860
We have to reboot the bad aid.

05:57.580 --> 05:58.900
So where were we?

05:59.230 --> 06:00.460
Yeah, we were in here.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.570
There is here.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.560
And there's also one.

06:03.830 --> 06:04.100
The.

06:05.580 --> 06:08.520
Mike and Kate over here right now, we have two options.

06:08.520 --> 06:14.010
I hope you understood why greed won't work because we will not be able to get this C if we take both

06:14.010 --> 06:15.600
these BS first aid.

06:16.170 --> 06:19.970
So in the similar fashion there can be many other cases in which it really won't.

06:21.220 --> 06:25.980
But I know what we have to do is we have to try both the parties, basically.

06:26.020 --> 06:27.310
Now we can also see.

06:28.450 --> 06:28.870
That.

06:30.580 --> 06:31.450
Let me be clear.

06:31.450 --> 06:31.930
I did.

06:34.170 --> 06:36.330
Nate, so didn't know what was happening.

06:36.990 --> 06:38.670
It's inside out.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.700
Let's see if S3.

06:44.340 --> 06:47.910
Active as three k is equal to s when i.

06:48.900 --> 06:52.860
Then we have to try to decide which is DPA e.g. you know.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.790
Okay, let me also say, what does DB here mean?

06:57.450 --> 07:08.580
So here we have DPA divided K means existing big J string and take this pasting from my 22 engaging

07:08.820 --> 07:11.520
and formulate a possibility of an interleaving.

07:12.570 --> 07:14.070
So always we have two options.

07:14.550 --> 07:20.400
The first of these two should come at this first place as three ks equals two as one.

07:20.970 --> 07:21.540
That means.

07:22.680 --> 07:23.580
I will move forward.

07:24.120 --> 07:27.030
That means you badges equals two GPA plus one.

07:27.510 --> 07:27.810
Yeah.

07:27.810 --> 07:30.720
That escape lesson because I imagined it.

07:31.230 --> 07:34.140
And we imagine we have moved more distinctly forward.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.620
Now simply the second case is if S2.

07:40.510 --> 07:41.530
If as streaky.

07:43.610 --> 07:46.960
Is equal to as you do.

07:47.870 --> 07:49.130
So in this case, what will happen?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.080
You all can now think about it.

07:51.950 --> 07:56.810
If both of those characters are equal, that means now S3 can be replaced by Mike means it can mean

07:56.810 --> 07:59.570
deliberate as to what I can simply say.

07:59.750 --> 08:04.490
Look, I didn't take anything from the S1 than the plus one and keep one.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.690
Well otherwise.

08:08.100 --> 08:11.270
In this case, what we are doing is we are trying both the parties.

08:11.540 --> 08:14.300
If this is equal, try this also.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.460
If this is equal, write this also.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.110
It's not even else.

08:18.620 --> 08:22.580
It is if there is equal that if this is equal, try this.

08:23.060 --> 08:24.920
It's not, you know, mutually exclusive.

08:25.220 --> 08:26.390
They can be done together.

08:27.050 --> 08:28.340
That's the same case here, right?

08:28.640 --> 08:29.900
If both are BS.

08:30.620 --> 08:30.920
Right.

08:30.920 --> 08:31.980
This B also here.

08:32.090 --> 08:32.410
Right.

08:32.420 --> 08:33.890
This B also in the first place.

08:33.890 --> 08:37.880
And tell me if it is possible or not and what will be the end case case?

08:38.300 --> 08:39.290
What will be the Yankees?

08:39.530 --> 08:44.210
These cases, if AII is equal to as one large size.

08:44.970 --> 08:45.560
And.

08:46.950 --> 08:47.220
Okay.

08:47.820 --> 08:50.730
So one thing should be mentioned in the problem.

08:52.730 --> 08:53.240
That.

08:54.970 --> 08:55.240
Okay.

08:55.240 --> 08:59.470
So it's not given that as trees length should be equal to everyone's land.

08:59.470 --> 09:02.440
And as to later, this is but but this is important.

09:03.130 --> 09:08.680
If their lands are not equal, that's if as wants land as one place as to land.

09:08.710 --> 09:15.940
I mean, if it is not equal to as trees land that then it's not possible at all that we cannot interleave

09:15.940 --> 09:16.120
them.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.640
To make the third string nature, the land has to be equal.

09:18.690 --> 09:19.720
This is the first check.

09:20.020 --> 09:24.610
We can have this jack in the beginning before even starting their dining programming solution.

09:25.330 --> 09:28.830
So in the dining program solution, we are here when the lands required it.

09:29.020 --> 09:33.550
So we can say if asked one word size equals two and Daisy goes to student size.

09:33.550 --> 09:36.100
That means they are both these the end.

09:36.400 --> 09:36.970
That means.

09:38.330 --> 09:39.530
Gay has also risen.

09:40.520 --> 09:46.700
So this problem will teach you one more new thing, and that is that we can easily see that right now

09:46.700 --> 09:53.090
the states are aging gay rights year and that means we have EPA of 3D.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.070
I drink eight, but actually it is not a 3D dip.

09:57.070 --> 10:01.420
It is actually dipping because in this the independent variables are only two.

10:01.570 --> 10:04.840
The third variable can be derived from the other two variables.

10:05.500 --> 10:12.220
One example I can always make this relation in which I think is equal to A-plus to my because if I is

10:12.220 --> 10:15.340
increasing, is increasing, or if J is increasing, then case increase.

10:16.030 --> 10:21.070
That means if I, if I were going to correct this on the first string and if I get to some of the second

10:21.070 --> 10:23.780
string, that means I will be on the it.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.130
Correct?

10:24.190 --> 10:28.390
That means I've already taken the seven characters to plus five characters from the third string.

10:28.660 --> 10:30.070
That means I want the eighth character.

10:30.070 --> 10:30.280
Right.

10:30.910 --> 10:32.110
I hope this is clear.

10:32.500 --> 10:32.720
Right.

10:33.010 --> 10:33.490
It means.

10:34.620 --> 10:36.780
If I is over here, these are very good.

10:36.780 --> 10:37.670
That means fun.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.330
And plus to these three characters, I already said.

10:40.350 --> 10:42.540
So it is equal to three eight.

10:42.540 --> 10:45.060
So I pledge they will always be equal looking.

10:45.810 --> 10:52.050
So if I can find a situation that means the variables are not dependent, means I can reduce one variable

10:52.050 --> 10:52.440
in this.

10:52.830 --> 10:56.760
And if even if I don't use the gay variable, then also.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.710
I'll get correct answers.

10:59.670 --> 11:02.140
So this is just for explanation purposes, identity.

11:02.320 --> 11:09.060
Even if you don't use it here, even if you just use I plus one NJ and I go major plus one and you know,

11:09.060 --> 11:12.300
derive gain inside the function by saying case equals to A-plus.

11:12.660 --> 11:16.290
Then also it would definitely work with this.

11:16.620 --> 11:21.500
So these are the best guesses if both of them, which is the intelligent leading eight.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.430
If one of them is the end.

11:24.530 --> 11:26.450
I just tried to move the other one forward.

11:26.480 --> 11:33.110
If they do not move forward, it means you're going to already handle the base case.

11:34.700 --> 11:40.370
So in the next part, I'll just quickly call it and it's very easy to code, I would suggest you alternate

11:40.370 --> 11:40.520
it.

11:41.430 --> 11:41.690
Eight.

11:42.790 --> 11:43.570
Well, thanks.
