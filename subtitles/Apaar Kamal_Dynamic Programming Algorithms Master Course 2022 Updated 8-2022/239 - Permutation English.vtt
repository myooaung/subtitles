00:00.660 --> 00:01.380
Let everyone.

00:02.640 --> 00:05.040
Welcome back to this new problem.

00:05.160 --> 00:08.340
And this is my favorite problem of the series.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.970
So let's read the problem statement.

00:12.390 --> 00:18.420
And it's really okay because we are moving one step above every time and we are like moving towards

00:18.420 --> 00:18.870
the end.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.250
Let me check.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.200
So here we have permutation, grouping, subtree in the watchtower grid in frog.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.420
So we have like eight problems left.

00:28.140 --> 00:28.370
Eight.

00:28.860 --> 00:29.220
So.

00:30.380 --> 00:33.650
The level of all the problems are increasing right now, basically.

00:34.100 --> 00:34.460
And.

00:35.630 --> 00:41.360
It's fine that if you find this problem tough, if you're not able to formulate a state for it or something

00:41.360 --> 00:44.210
like that, because this problem is a little tricky.

00:44.210 --> 00:50.270
And in this problem you have to notice some properties or permutations, and after that only you will

00:50.270 --> 00:51.830
be able to come up with a solution.

00:52.670 --> 00:54.170
So let's read this.

00:54.170 --> 00:56.450
Let's understand the problem, and then we'll discuss it.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.920
So let and be a positive integer.

01:00.310 --> 01:07.480
You are given a string of length and minus one consisting of less than and greater than characters.

01:08.110 --> 01:13.930
Finding number of permutations of B1 to be and of one doing that satisfy the following condition.

01:14.710 --> 01:17.920
So here we have a modulo 21 number seven.

01:18.730 --> 01:19.590
Well, no problem.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.470
We'll do that later.

01:21.100 --> 01:28.810
For each, I will pay a lesson pay plus one of the characters lesson or A and B, I should be greater

01:28.810 --> 01:29.770
than B plus one.

01:29.770 --> 01:33.310
If the character is greater than good, no problem.

01:33.860 --> 01:36.310
What we have is we have PN minus one.

01:37.540 --> 01:38.200
Characters.

01:38.530 --> 01:44.710
And we have to fill all the endless that decision to these n minus one characters by using a permutation

01:45.010 --> 01:49.930
from when doing that so that this particular equation is satisfied.

01:50.080 --> 01:50.300
Right.

01:50.770 --> 01:52.870
If I fill it with one, three, two, four.

01:52.960 --> 01:53.890
So what do I get?

01:55.780 --> 01:56.200
One.

01:57.430 --> 01:59.460
Three, two, four, eight.

01:59.490 --> 02:01.240
So what are the strings?

02:05.020 --> 02:06.040
But this was a string.

02:07.450 --> 02:08.200
I can sing.

02:09.260 --> 02:09.860
Third string.

02:10.160 --> 02:14.060
So we have these three characters and we have to.

02:15.230 --> 02:16.650
But this was one possible way.

02:16.700 --> 02:20.300
The second possible way is one, four, two, three.

02:21.290 --> 02:21.640
Right.

02:22.100 --> 02:26.630
Third possible way is two, three, one and four.

02:27.690 --> 02:28.080
Right.

02:28.540 --> 02:33.510
So as you can see, there is less than three trees is greater than one, one is less than four and so

02:33.510 --> 02:33.660
on.

02:33.660 --> 02:36.870
So one is less than four, four is greater than two is less than three.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.550
So all of these are satisfying.

02:38.550 --> 02:43.550
The conditions given in my string is the student.

02:43.590 --> 02:48.450
So y is not equal to given in this because we have a permutation, no two elements can be equal.

02:48.450 --> 02:52.620
They will be either greater than or they will be less than the element.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.060
I hope that's fine too.

02:54.060 --> 02:54.960
Here we have five.

02:55.950 --> 03:01.370
In this case, we have only one particular option, which is a one, two, three, four, five, eight.

03:01.830 --> 03:05.340
Only one possible permutation will be satisfying this condition.

03:06.180 --> 03:07.800
Next is 28.

03:07.830 --> 03:11.820
So this is just to check whether our code works fine or not when we'll call it out.

03:12.890 --> 03:13.890
It's still huge.

03:14.280 --> 03:18.180
And of course, there are many more permutations that would satisfy this.

03:19.790 --> 03:24.950
Answer more than this because this is kind of modular and it's 1978.

03:26.130 --> 03:27.580
The answer is really very big.

03:27.600 --> 03:34.070
So in just just 422 so big, then just think about what it would be for Italian food.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.050
And there are so many infected populations possible.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.540
Where do we start with this problem?

03:39.870 --> 03:44.700
Even even I faced issues with this problem initially, but where do I start with it?

03:45.930 --> 03:49.590
There are a few things that will notice and then we'll begin.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.990
Let's start from brute force, as we all do.

03:52.110 --> 03:53.760
So what's a brute force solution here?

03:55.300 --> 03:59.560
We have one, two, three, four places and we have three characters.

03:59.740 --> 04:07.390
Less than greater than less than the most basic brute force solution would be to have a backtracking

04:07.390 --> 04:07.840
solution.

04:07.840 --> 04:13.360
They'd like, keep on filling all the numbers here and keep even filling the next number here.

04:13.540 --> 04:15.370
Let's say you fill one who were there then.

04:15.370 --> 04:17.770
What are the other numbers that can be filled over here?

04:17.770 --> 04:19.320
It can be two, three, eight.

04:19.900 --> 04:23.170
Basically, what that what we need to do is we need to keep a set.

04:23.650 --> 04:26.860
Look, these are the elements which are the remaining elements.

04:27.280 --> 04:31.150
Initially, we have a set of one, two, three, four elements.

04:31.390 --> 04:37.210
All the elements are during the set which are remaining the let's see, I feel one over there now.

04:37.210 --> 04:41.200
One has gone from my and I pass on the set to the next step here.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.410
What I have is I have two, three and four, eight.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.800
So let's say okay, so I have two, three and four in my set.

04:48.220 --> 04:53.800
Now we see we have a less than sign and, and the number that I feel was, was one it.

04:53.800 --> 04:59.470
So basically we have to keep track of this also what was the number, what was the actual digit that

04:59.470 --> 05:03.670
we placed one step before because we want to satisfy this condition.

05:03.850 --> 05:10.090
If I placed one, that means all the other elements which are greater than one and in the set can be

05:10.090 --> 05:11.470
filled reflect this particular location.

05:12.100 --> 05:12.420
Right?

05:12.700 --> 05:15.790
So let's say I feel I can fill any of them.

05:15.790 --> 05:17.530
Two, three, four, all of them are possible.

05:17.530 --> 05:18.610
So let's say I failed two.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.040
If I bring two, then what is the remaining set?

05:21.040 --> 05:22.450
The remaining set is to the end.

05:22.450 --> 05:27.250
For now, I can fill at the three and four at this location.

05:27.250 --> 05:31.420
So we have to check what was the element that I filled in the previous position, which was two.

05:31.810 --> 05:36.460
So if I fail to in the previous position and now I can only fill the elements which are less than two,

05:36.850 --> 05:39.850
but in my set I have elements three and four which are greater than two.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.110
Who will there be a possible permutation starting from one and two?

05:43.540 --> 05:48.340
No, but in this case what I'll do is I'll simply backtrack because there are no elements which are

05:48.340 --> 05:48.940
less than two.

05:48.940 --> 05:51.070
Anything can be filled over here.

05:51.250 --> 05:51.520
Right?

05:51.640 --> 05:53.470
So in this case, what I'll do is I'll backtrack.

05:53.890 --> 05:54.910
So let's go back.

05:54.910 --> 05:55.720
Let's step back.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.490
And instead of bullets, fill three.

05:58.860 --> 06:00.450
It is all better than books, right?

06:00.810 --> 06:03.120
It removes whatever you have failed.

06:03.120 --> 06:06.510
It corrects your mistakes and makes a new pot, basically.

06:06.990 --> 06:11.070
So let's say I filled three over here and although the remaining said is two in four, now I have to

06:11.070 --> 06:14.400
fill our number, which is less than three, so only to satisfy the property.

06:14.880 --> 06:19.530
And after this, the only side which is remaining is for four will be filled over here.

06:19.530 --> 06:22.070
And I found one possible way.

06:22.380 --> 06:24.060
That means I have filled all of these.

06:24.300 --> 06:24.480
Right.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.880
Two, one, three, two, four is a possibility.

06:27.660 --> 06:27.930
Well.

06:28.950 --> 06:29.310
Now.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.310
Now, again, what we'll do is we'll backtrack to how do we backtrack?

06:32.310 --> 06:34.430
Will you move forward from here?

06:34.440 --> 06:40.260
We'll try place you try to play some other terms over here which we cannot place because only for was

06:40.260 --> 06:40.740
available.

06:40.980 --> 06:45.900
Now I will remove to and we'll try placing food away, which we cannot because food is not less than

06:45.900 --> 06:46.950
38.

06:47.130 --> 06:50.220
So again, we will backtrack and will place food over you.

06:51.650 --> 06:53.780
Because we can place food, because food is greater than one.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.150
Now the remaining elements are two and three.

06:56.480 --> 07:00.050
So we can place two over here and three over here, eight.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.220
And then we'll backtrack and we'll try to place three over here.

07:03.230 --> 07:06.920
But then we will not be able to place you in the last position.

07:07.190 --> 07:09.200
This is all a normal backtracking solution.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.940
Will look like you will have a set.

07:10.940 --> 07:15.290
You will have a devious element that this is the previous element that was filled.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.400
The previous position.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.360
So that I can.

07:18.890 --> 07:19.790
Consider these.

07:21.110 --> 07:22.820
Characters like this.

07:23.960 --> 07:32.000
I hope now, like if you have reached this location of the course, you can easily write a backtracking

07:32.000 --> 07:32.870
solution for this.

07:34.010 --> 07:35.410
But back to the solution.

07:35.420 --> 07:39.020
What it will do is it will keep on filling the elements one by one.

07:40.100 --> 07:40.910
It will keep those.

07:41.090 --> 07:42.800
It will fill those elements one by one.

07:42.800 --> 07:50.480
And if it fails those elements one by one, then it will make all possible ways to fill this.

07:51.520 --> 07:51.820
Eight.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.630
If it makes all possible ways to fill it, then.

07:59.330 --> 07:59.650
Yeah.

07:59.660 --> 08:00.200
So if it.

08:02.350 --> 08:03.040
Let's just again.

08:04.260 --> 08:04.560
Yes.

08:04.850 --> 08:09.660
So if it fits with all possible ways, then it will take a lot of time and effort because we know that

08:10.200 --> 08:15.120
there were five years for this, but they were there are so many ways for this particular event.

08:15.150 --> 08:17.130
The the reason bigger because this is a model.

08:27.230 --> 08:28.410
So what next?

08:28.490 --> 08:30.680
Like, we know that backtracking won't work.

08:30.860 --> 08:34.790
So some of you might be wondering, okay, that this is again.

08:35.920 --> 08:36.140
Yeah.

08:36.370 --> 08:37.330
So, buddy.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.100
Now backtracking solution won't work over here, right?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.180
So what will work?

08:42.180 --> 08:44.280
What will help us?

08:45.640 --> 08:46.270
DP Right.

08:46.990 --> 08:48.130
So let's see.

08:48.130 --> 08:52.630
A new way of thinking of the solutions are tell me, guys, if it was not one, two, three, four,

08:53.350 --> 08:53.620
eight.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.640
If it was not one, two, three, four, but just so many distinct numbers.

08:57.910 --> 08:59.650
Then also the answer would have been same rate.

09:00.220 --> 09:02.800
But what I'm saying is, let's see if it is not one, two, three, four.

09:03.100 --> 09:06.400
Let's say it is two, five, seven and nine.

09:06.430 --> 09:07.900
We have four distinct numbers.

09:08.470 --> 09:10.410
Then also the answer would have been same.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.000
They would have been five.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.960
Possible answers for this.

09:16.660 --> 09:21.730
If there are only five possible answers and they would also have been when the numbers went to five,

09:22.510 --> 09:23.260
seven and nine.

09:24.320 --> 09:24.620
Eight.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.270
So I hope you're getting this vibe because.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.370
I simply index them.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.290
This is the first biggest number.

09:32.290 --> 09:33.230
The second biggest number.

09:33.230 --> 09:34.970
Third, biggest number and fourth, biggest number.

09:35.240 --> 09:39.530
And instead of two, five, seven, nine, I can please one, two, three, four, two, eight, and

09:39.680 --> 09:44.630
then afterwards replace them and replace them with whatever the number is kept over here, which is

09:44.630 --> 09:46.370
two, five, seven, eight, nine, eight.

09:46.850 --> 09:52.460
So this was to me, this was a first kind of thing to notice that.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.160
We can easily.

09:58.160 --> 10:00.620
Well, there was a lot of noise in my area, so.

10:03.760 --> 10:08.380
Have you understood this particular point, that it can be any of the numbers?

10:08.380 --> 10:08.610
Right.

10:08.620 --> 10:13.090
Instead of saying that you only have a population, you can have any of the four distinct numbers.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.760
And the answer would be seem there would be five.

10:15.850 --> 10:18.670
So what we had is we saw different ways.

10:18.670 --> 10:21.070
So instead of one, right, what is at place one?

10:21.070 --> 10:22.810
It is two instead of three.

10:22.870 --> 10:23.160
Right?

10:23.170 --> 10:26.140
What is it, three which is seven, then five and then nine.

10:26.140 --> 10:28.060
So you can see this is another valid.

10:29.050 --> 10:30.250
Answer eight.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.330
So that's what I meant.

10:32.440 --> 10:36.300
That's what I want you to make me do tonight.

10:36.460 --> 10:37.890
Able to you eight.

10:38.260 --> 10:38.560
That.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.900
Instead of a permutation, you can have any of the numbers.

10:43.090 --> 10:48.780
So instead of saying, is that okay, you have a set of numbers, one, two, three, four.

10:49.110 --> 10:57.120
What I did say is I have a set of numbers where s numbers are greater than if s numbers are smaller

10:57.120 --> 11:03.040
than the previous number, which I filled, and the numbers are greater than the previous them, whether

11:03.060 --> 11:03.510
I fit.

11:04.550 --> 11:08.750
Well, because we know that we don't want the exact numbers.

11:08.780 --> 11:09.440
If I knew that.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.290
Okay, these many numbers are less than the previous number, which is fake.

11:12.410 --> 11:16.760
Then I have these many slots which can be these many numbers which can be filled in the next slot,

11:17.150 --> 11:18.110
by the way.

11:18.650 --> 11:21.530
I have the numbers which are greater than the previous numbers so I can fill those.

11:21.950 --> 11:27.560
So I don't actually want to say I just want to values that these are these many are the numbers which

11:27.560 --> 11:29.270
can be filled at that particular location.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.650
Initially, let's say I am filling it with one.

11:32.720 --> 11:40.070
So again, coming back to the example of when and how many smaller numbers from when I have.

11:41.150 --> 11:46.570
I have zero numbers which are smaller than one and I'm talking about this eight.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.960
So I'm not considering a set.

11:47.960 --> 11:52.370
I'm just considering numbers smaller than and numbers greater than a particular number which has been

11:52.370 --> 11:53.030
filled already.

11:53.750 --> 11:58.280
But I have zero numbers which are smaller than one and I have three numbers which are greater than one.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.820
But how many numbers can come at this particular location?

12:02.570 --> 12:02.780
Eight.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.150
So basically, what what is happening over here?

12:05.630 --> 12:06.980
I have a set of numbers.

12:08.030 --> 12:08.320
Bull.

12:08.870 --> 12:14.630
And what I'm doing is I'm picking one number from the outset, eight, that can be any of the numbers.

12:14.930 --> 12:21.080
So let's say this is X one, this is X two, x three and so on, and it's five X in numbers.

12:21.580 --> 12:24.530
So I'm picking up some numbers, some number from middle.

12:24.530 --> 12:26.840
So let's and picking some x m number from middle.

12:27.200 --> 12:33.470
Now, I've divided this effort into two parts that again, I have these many numbers we just starting

12:33.470 --> 12:34.280
from excellent.

12:34.280 --> 12:39.950
And it goes to likes and minus one that these many other numbers which are smaller than him and.

12:41.470 --> 12:44.220
These many numbers are greater than eight.

12:44.230 --> 12:47.740
So these are the count of the numbers which are smaller and these are the count of the numbers which

12:47.740 --> 12:48.520
are great.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.190
So that's what I'm trying to do over there.

12:50.470 --> 12:56.230
If I fill one over here, that means I have zero smaller numbers left to fill at this location and three

12:56.230 --> 12:59.910
greater numbers than one which can be filled at this particular location.

13:00.250 --> 13:00.500
Eight.

13:00.640 --> 13:06.760
So if three greater numbers can be found at this particular location, the let's fill any one of those

13:06.760 --> 13:07.020
numbers.

13:07.030 --> 13:10.450
So right now we know that it is two, three and four, the greater numbers.

13:10.690 --> 13:16.540
But let's say I do not know about this number eight that I do not know about this number, this particular

13:16.540 --> 13:16.780
number.

13:16.780 --> 13:17.890
So initially, guess what?

13:17.890 --> 13:21.600
I have I have all these and numbers eight.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.800
So if I'm filling the first number out of those numbers right now, I'm not saying that over permutation.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.010
I have some animals in 38.

13:30.280 --> 13:36.040
So if I fill the first number in this ordered order, then of course I'll have zero comma and minus

13:36.040 --> 13:36.280
one.

13:37.500 --> 13:44.310
And the next place they'd what if a place second number at this particular location then what I'll have

13:44.310 --> 13:48.450
is I'll have a number which is smaller than the second number which is there in the SEC.

13:48.900 --> 13:52.030
And how many numbers I greater than this.

13:52.050 --> 13:57.360
And minus two numbers would be greater than the number to which can be found in the next particular

13:57.360 --> 13:57.810
location.

13:58.110 --> 14:02.700
I'm just keeping a count of the numbers that I can fill at a particular location.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.870
So this is important because this is like an important step to understand.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.630
So I filled one initially left sampling the first, the smallest number.

14:11.930 --> 14:14.600
Whichever it is, it will be one if it's a population.

14:15.140 --> 14:20.840
Now, I have zero smaller numbers and three bigger numbers than one to reflect this particular location

14:20.930 --> 14:22.100
and the second index.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.530
So I can see that I have.

14:25.790 --> 14:26.240
This.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.900
Character, what the character means.

14:29.130 --> 14:35.430
If I feel that if it is greater than get it right so I know we can see it is a less than character.

14:35.520 --> 14:40.680
That means the next number that needs to be found at the secure location should be greater than the

14:40.830 --> 14:41.550
previous number.

14:41.550 --> 14:42.120
That means.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.380
I do not know what is the previous number that I feel.

14:45.710 --> 14:51.210
I feel a number which divides my head into two parts, which is the smaller numbers, integrating numbers.

14:52.020 --> 14:57.090
That means now I can only use this regret as I must be feeling at this particular location.

14:58.240 --> 14:58.540
Eight.

14:59.990 --> 15:00.160
Okay.

15:00.420 --> 15:04.200
So now let's see, I have three greater numbers and let me write them over here.

15:04.230 --> 15:08.850
Let's say I have three great animals, which are some by one by two via three.

15:08.850 --> 15:11.730
I'm not taking exact numbers, just taking some greater numbers.

15:12.150 --> 15:12.990
So I have triggered a.

15:13.350 --> 15:14.970
And how many smaller numbers I have?

15:14.970 --> 15:15.330
Zero.

15:15.510 --> 15:18.270
So this is an empty set and the greater numbers are three by one.

15:18.270 --> 15:24.840
By the way, at this particular location, guys, if I fill it with Vivan because I can fill it with

15:24.840 --> 15:30.600
Vivan only because it is a great design and I can only use the numbers which are greater than the previous

15:30.600 --> 15:31.350
number, which I have.

15:32.530 --> 15:33.130
Separated.

15:33.550 --> 15:35.830
What if I fill it with by one by one again?

15:35.860 --> 15:38.980
By when is the first greater number than the previous element?

15:39.280 --> 15:39.600
Eight.

15:40.150 --> 15:42.520
If I fill this location with by one, what I'll get?

15:43.550 --> 15:45.530
What will be the next set.

15:46.130 --> 15:50.510
So the smaller numbers by will be still with zero because the set is zero.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.280
What is it?

15:52.400 --> 15:58.080
That means if I'm feeling it with V, when I divided the said into two bites eight, the two time as

15:58.100 --> 16:04.230
part is this monolithic elements then by one which is zero because earlier there were no element is

16:04.280 --> 16:05.090
smaller than by one.

16:05.420 --> 16:08.900
And the second part is in the movie, greater than by one, which is by winning by two.

16:08.900 --> 16:09.980
So we have two numbers.

16:11.270 --> 16:16.370
So this is the next set that okay, if I'm feeling it with the first I use number, which is five one

16:16.370 --> 16:22.400
in this case, then now I can fill this location with zero smaller numbers, then by one and two greater

16:22.880 --> 16:27.800
numbers, then by one by considering this particular character.

16:28.220 --> 16:31.460
But I know let's say we have a character which is less than eight.

16:31.790 --> 16:32.930
But if I have this character.

16:32.930 --> 16:33.740
Which is less than.

16:36.040 --> 16:39.910
That means now I can only feel the elements which are part of.

16:41.030 --> 16:43.810
This less said because I already feel violent.

16:43.850 --> 16:44.840
Everyone is divided.

16:44.840 --> 16:49.910
The set into two parts is smaller than violence and greater than violence is smaller than violence as

16:49.910 --> 16:51.110
zero eight.

16:51.230 --> 16:54.830
And I have a character which is less than eight.

16:54.950 --> 16:59.360
So if if I can only feel the elements which are smaller than one, that means.

17:00.410 --> 17:05.600
I will only consider the number of elements which are in it as so how many elements are there?

17:05.600 --> 17:07.490
And insert is zero elements.

17:07.710 --> 17:09.920
So that means I will not be able to fill anything away.

17:10.370 --> 17:11.310
I hope you are getting this.

17:11.600 --> 17:14.120
Now we'll get now we come back will backtrack basically.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.750
And we will fill it with why do.

17:17.450 --> 17:18.670
If I fill it with vital.

17:18.680 --> 17:19.790
So this was my set.

17:20.710 --> 17:21.580
At this location.

17:21.580 --> 17:28.720
At the second location, derailments were smaller than one and the elements were greater than one grade

17:28.720 --> 17:31.000
with reviving by the them or digging to three four.

17:31.510 --> 17:32.770
I just wanted to give you an example.

17:34.450 --> 17:39.530
So it doesn't matter what is viable by the advisory board matters is that these are the elements which

17:39.530 --> 17:43.690
were greater than one, which was greater than the last element that I feel they were three elements

17:43.690 --> 17:44.290
greater than that.

17:44.740 --> 17:49.490
Now let's I'm filling it with this second highest element because we know we have a.

17:50.900 --> 17:54.850
Characters such that we have to fill the numbers which are greater than the previous element.

17:54.860 --> 17:55.980
So we have three elements greater.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.550
We have to write the first when we are drawing the second one.

17:59.090 --> 18:03.170
If I fill it with V two, then what will be the next location?

18:05.190 --> 18:06.690
What will be this next location?

18:07.880 --> 18:09.140
The next location will be.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.150
Think about it, like what will be the group here?

18:14.160 --> 18:15.700
What will be ascendis?

18:16.080 --> 18:18.920
The everything is it is with respect to why, right?

18:19.470 --> 18:20.940
So this was the whole set.

18:21.090 --> 18:24.760
So if I take value, that means then a movie just smaller than a good.

18:24.870 --> 18:28.140
The numbers which were in the set as will still be smaller than VI do.

18:28.140 --> 18:28.590
Because.

18:28.860 --> 18:29.820
So how many as were there?

18:29.820 --> 18:30.840
Zero less.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.220
How many numbers are smaller?

18:32.220 --> 18:36.930
Then why do we know it is only one number which is smaller than why do those numbers which are smaller

18:36.930 --> 18:39.840
than wider one and then the most which are greater than do are also one.

18:41.050 --> 18:42.100
We're getting this right.

18:42.250 --> 18:48.700
And now at this particular location at the end, the next three, what are the elements that I can fill?

18:49.000 --> 18:54.640
As we know, we have a greater than that means I can only fill elements which are less than I do now.

18:55.210 --> 19:00.370
Eight Because of the same now that means now I will only consider this particular set.

19:00.390 --> 19:07.630
So what does this say represents this small represents by one and big represents by three i we are getting

19:07.630 --> 19:13.810
this every small and greater groups are in respect to vibrance and values.

19:13.810 --> 19:18.670
And the previous element that I have filled out the here I have only one element is smaller.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.100
So I'll fill that element, whatever it is.

19:21.100 --> 19:25.390
Let's say I'm feeling it over here, which is right now we have one eight.

19:25.540 --> 19:26.410
And after this.

19:27.630 --> 19:28.310
I'll move on.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.930
And what will be the new sands for this case?

19:31.200 --> 19:34.110
If I feel that element, then how many elements are smaller than this?

19:34.350 --> 19:34.740
Zero.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.240
And how many elements are greater than this?

19:36.690 --> 19:36.990
One?

19:37.650 --> 19:37.920
Eight.

19:38.100 --> 19:38.520
Nine.

19:38.820 --> 19:42.090
Now we have the next character, which is a lesbian character.

19:42.090 --> 19:48.030
That means the number here which would be greater than VI when it should be in the group G.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.690
The Group G has one element I'll feel it over here and more here.

19:52.200 --> 19:57.330
Eight So at any point of time is we can notice it as plus g would be equal to.

19:59.280 --> 20:03.090
The number of alimony which are smaller and the number of elements which are greater would be equal

20:03.090 --> 20:03.300
to.

20:04.530 --> 20:04.860
Actually.

20:04.860 --> 20:09.060
What does this indeed represent as represents a number of elements which are smaller than the previous

20:09.060 --> 20:11.470
element but are there in the third act.

20:11.700 --> 20:16.920
That means they're not replaced elements and what the jury presents in number of elements which are

20:16.920 --> 20:19.410
there in this set but greater than the previous element.

20:19.840 --> 20:23.790
But both as indeed are those elements majority yet not pleased.

20:24.550 --> 20:24.810
Okay.

20:25.290 --> 20:32.040
So if I index them with zero, let's take them with zero zero and let's index this with one, two and

20:32.040 --> 20:33.000
three eight.

20:33.420 --> 20:37.080
So I can see that at any moment of time how many elements are not placed?

20:37.140 --> 20:42.930
So if I might indicate one, so how many elements are not placed and minus elements are not placed.

20:43.550 --> 20:46.250
But again, I see that as produce equals two and minus a.

20:49.560 --> 20:53.850
Because and is equal to four in this case because we have four places to fill.

20:54.570 --> 20:58.300
And if I want to index one, that means I filled only one place eight.

20:58.410 --> 21:02.550
That means if I'm one index, I have filled I places only I previous places.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.200
So how many elements are remaining?

21:04.200 --> 21:09.120
And minus eight and minus eight is equal to the number of elements which are not placed.

21:09.260 --> 21:11.670
So they can be smaller or greater depending on the element.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.390
We are placing the previous position.

21:13.890 --> 21:14.210
Right.

21:14.910 --> 21:17.040
So this was about a little bit.

21:17.190 --> 21:22.770
So this is a little bit about a theory of thinking of the solution in a different way instead of having

21:22.770 --> 21:24.200
the exact numbers in the set.

21:24.630 --> 21:29.790
This have the count of the numbers which are smaller than the current element and the numbers which

21:29.790 --> 21:30.720
are greater than the current.

21:31.940 --> 21:32.160
We?

21:33.120 --> 21:38.430
Because in the next location we can only place those numbers which are smaller than if I have a.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.380
This same vein.

21:41.560 --> 21:47.500
So if I feel exhilarated, then I can only feel some vice, which is Vice President IX in the next four

21:47.500 --> 21:47.630
years.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.350
So that means only smaller group works over here.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.770
But if I have a.

21:54.260 --> 21:55.260
A positive character.

21:55.260 --> 21:59.520
That means whatever it takes, I feel, and I can only feel the elements which are greater than the

21:59.520 --> 22:00.870
sex at this particular location.

22:01.380 --> 22:04.050
Now, if I want to feel that, hey.

22:04.200 --> 22:08.010
So if I'm feeling the first greater element, that means how many smaller elements are there?

22:08.520 --> 22:09.060
What is it?

22:09.810 --> 22:16.470
To be fair, it should be equal to s that were already smaller than the first greater element, as will

22:16.470 --> 22:17.090
always be there.

22:17.100 --> 22:17.290
Eight.

22:18.330 --> 22:19.290
Do not get confused.

22:19.410 --> 22:21.060
Let's write it properly.

22:26.760 --> 22:29.070
See here I visit s committee.

22:29.640 --> 22:33.330
That means s are smaller than X and D greater than.

22:33.900 --> 22:34.070
No.

22:34.260 --> 22:35.220
Well, not.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.300
I'm not.

22:36.300 --> 22:37.900
I have a greater than saying over here.

22:37.920 --> 22:43.980
So what is greater than sign means that I can only place the elements which are in this empty pool,

22:44.370 --> 22:46.320
the number of elements which are in G.

22:46.440 --> 22:49.650
So let's m placing the first element, which is energy.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.320
That can be a new element, but it is greater than X.

22:52.320 --> 22:53.010
That's what I know.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.630
And this is the first greater element.

22:55.260 --> 22:59.880
If I'm placing the first greater element, let's call it Division one, then what?

22:59.880 --> 23:05.460
What are the elements which are smaller than even s will always be smaller than given because inside

23:05.460 --> 23:08.130
smaller than X and one is greater than x.

23:08.940 --> 23:11.700
That means s will always be less energy even so.

23:11.700 --> 23:17.610
So the next small element is s and how many elements are greater than you know do minus one.

23:18.300 --> 23:23.700
If I'm placing the second greatest element at this location, by it means how many smaller elements

23:23.700 --> 23:24.060
I have.

23:24.270 --> 23:29.410
I s plus one smaller elements because s are already smaller and d one is also smaller.

23:29.430 --> 23:33.000
Because I'm placing G2 right now, I'm placing due to right.

23:33.450 --> 23:37.620
So it becomes s plus one will be small elements because more or less it is already smaller and there

23:37.620 --> 23:39.000
is given which is also smaller.

23:39.870 --> 23:46.320
Now in the second location, what I have is g minus two elements that are greater than two because the

23:46.320 --> 23:52.440
elements in such a similarly guys as plus two will be smaller elements if I place G3, the third graders

23:52.440 --> 23:53.210
element said.

23:54.560 --> 23:59.870
It will be split surplus, two elements smaller than the current element, and the minus three elements

23:59.870 --> 24:00.860
are greater than current value.

24:00.900 --> 24:03.910
And similarly, I'll place all the elements still down.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.200
That means the last greater element.

24:06.650 --> 24:10.790
It will give me a surplus of whatever is a so let's call it GM.

24:10.880 --> 24:16.880
So as plus M will be the number of element which is smaller than that and D-minus M will be the number

24:16.890 --> 24:22.600
elements which are greater than and this will be equal to zero in the end because I am placing the most

24:22.620 --> 24:26.210
greater element for all the other elements, this one smaller than that.

24:28.640 --> 24:35.210
So so it should be plus and minus one eight because it's plus when you minus two plus two do minus three.

24:35.210 --> 24:38.780
So as I say, minus one, do minus which will be zero.

24:39.410 --> 24:39.650
Well.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.440
So yes.

24:43.450 --> 24:49.650
So this was about the brute force approach in the next in the next video will go desperate was approach.

24:50.070 --> 24:53.940
But then we realized that okay if this is a brute force this will also not work.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.920
This will also not work.

24:56.220 --> 24:59.020
A Viber does not work.

24:59.040 --> 24:59.790
We'll see that.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.140
And then we'll again optimize that.

25:01.650 --> 25:08.280
And you will be reminded of a solution that we have already done and we'll be taking help from that

25:08.280 --> 25:08.820
solution.

25:09.060 --> 25:09.350
Eight.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.040
It's a good question.

25:11.040 --> 25:11.790
It's a long question.

25:11.790 --> 25:14.070
Just stay there and see the next part.

25:14.370 --> 25:14.730
Thank you.
