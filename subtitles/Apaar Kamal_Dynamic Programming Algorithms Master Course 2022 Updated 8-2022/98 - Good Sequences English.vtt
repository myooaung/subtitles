00:00.640 --> 00:01.300
Hello, everyone.

00:01.420 --> 00:07.780
This is my favorite problem from before says not favorite, but not the favorite problem from good voices.

00:08.560 --> 00:14.230
It's regarding DP and it will give you a deep insight on what is anime programming.

00:14.300 --> 00:14.840
A little.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.310
Hello.

00:16.690 --> 00:20.620
I'm taking this problem because I want you to understand because I know you understood.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.740
How is Eliot's problem working right?

00:22.750 --> 00:24.310
How are the connections being made?

00:24.580 --> 00:31.180
Of course we didn't optimize it, but still we understood how it actually working and how to solve that

00:31.180 --> 00:31.570
problem.

00:32.110 --> 00:35.680
Well, this is a problem of the Elias problem, I'd say.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.270
And I want you to.

00:38.520 --> 00:39.690
Deep dive into this problem.

00:39.690 --> 00:43.920
So this is good sequences and it's from content number 264.

00:44.760 --> 00:51.130
So you can really you can Google good sequences or forces quickly boils of you do you read the problem

00:51.510 --> 00:53.580
yourself right yourself, of course.

00:53.940 --> 01:00.750
And by using the alias approach that we discussed and then of course we'll discuss it encoded as well.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.060
So we have a squirrel list and.

01:05.960 --> 01:06.100
Yeah.

01:06.950 --> 01:07.320
Okay.

01:08.380 --> 01:08.680
Okay.

01:08.680 --> 01:14.860
So she thinks and indeed is even doing a good mine and now she's invested in good sequences.

01:15.430 --> 01:17.380
The sequence which is what makes one we.

01:18.250 --> 01:24.010
You can be any number from one twin it's called good if it satisfied the following three condition there

01:24.010 --> 01:30.340
does trigger nations rate sequences strictly increasing rate so they strictly uh, the sequence is strictly

01:30.340 --> 01:33.010
increasing, which is the elegance rate.

01:33.010 --> 01:38.080
So it is clearly is basically well the first condition is very clear.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.550
The sequence has to be increasing.

01:39.550 --> 01:42.220
The second condition is the most important one, which is.

01:43.130 --> 01:45.100
Nor do I think elements are coping.

01:45.860 --> 01:50.060
It is dcd off so we know where it is go prime rate.

01:50.510 --> 01:55.950
If two elements have equal to one, that means the greatest comedy of either of them is fine.

01:55.970 --> 01:58.730
They don't have any other movies in common except for one.

01:59.270 --> 02:00.890
That means they are coupling.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.450
Otherwise they're not so, nor too a distinct element of coping.

02:06.070 --> 02:12.440
In fact, if I'm digging two up as a number in the series that I can take forward, I can take six.

02:12.440 --> 02:15.050
I can read into it as a next number in the set.

02:15.680 --> 02:16.610
I'm taking six.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.440
I can take it as well.

02:18.740 --> 02:22.790
Nine as with eight voicing nine because nine and six.

02:23.150 --> 02:24.900
I'm not complaining with eight.

02:26.240 --> 02:26.510
Yeah.

02:27.170 --> 02:27.500
So.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.260
And all the elements of the sequence are good integers.

02:30.260 --> 02:31.280
And what are good integers?

02:31.280 --> 02:31.910
Good integer?

02:31.910 --> 02:35.300
Nothing but even two in which is already given to us.

02:35.690 --> 02:36.430
It will start.

02:36.470 --> 02:38.360
Condition is not that heavy.

02:38.360 --> 02:44.600
First condition is also not that heavy anyway because first condition simply say that it should be in

02:45.240 --> 02:46.520
a clean breathing sequence.

02:46.820 --> 02:47.480
And if you.

02:49.010 --> 02:56.130
See this, that if you see the input that it's given to us, it simply says that we have a single space

02:56.130 --> 02:59.480
separated list of good integers and instantly increasing order.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.790
But they they're already strictly increasing.

03:03.730 --> 03:04.810
What I have to avoid.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.370
So basically what I have.

03:06.370 --> 03:06.820
Let me.

03:08.430 --> 03:09.330
I conclude this?

03:10.440 --> 03:18.480
We have we have an increasingly increasing sequence already and we already have any is in sequence.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.640
You don't have to started it now.

03:20.640 --> 03:26.280
We just have to find out a sequence within the sequence, basically a sub sequence of this letter that

03:26.520 --> 03:28.140
no to a different elements are copying.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.520
But it what example it see the example.

03:32.550 --> 03:38.640
The first example is 523468, which is five the length of the sequence.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.480
Two, three, four, six, nine full.

03:43.540 --> 03:46.150
Tell me, guys, if I start with two.

03:46.720 --> 03:53.320
I can include three road, but I can include Ford and Active or I can include six as well because Ford

03:53.320 --> 03:54.070
and six are not.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.360
We'll bring it.

03:57.440 --> 04:01.190
So it's very clearly stated that a dissent elements.

04:02.880 --> 04:03.720
Are not cooperating.

04:04.650 --> 04:10.170
It doesn't mean that the first and the last element or some other element, it just says that the enduring

04:10.170 --> 04:10.790
elements are not.

04:12.150 --> 04:17.460
And after six air conditioning here, we can see that to a 9:00 go primary, but to a nine to in nine

04:17.460 --> 04:18.390
at not adjacent.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.000
I'm not making this connection.

04:20.850 --> 04:23.820
The connection is from 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 and 6 to 9.

04:25.210 --> 04:29.170
Some of you might be wondering, okay, so what did you have to enforce?

04:29.950 --> 04:32.570
What did your studio four and six it's two.

04:32.710 --> 04:34.780
And what are the of six in nine it's.

04:36.770 --> 04:40.400
But basically what I mean to say I mean to say that.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.640
This is a valid sequence.

04:42.970 --> 04:44.550
Two, four, six, nine, eight.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.060
And what is the length of the sequence?

04:46.060 --> 04:46.480
It's four.

04:47.290 --> 04:47.590
So.

04:48.540 --> 04:51.030
Is there any other sequence which at a higher end than this?

04:51.660 --> 04:52.440
I don't think so.

04:52.800 --> 04:53.070
Right.

04:53.730 --> 04:54.000
So.

04:56.720 --> 05:01.760
So let's go back and apply the brute force approach.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.880
And brute force approach would be very simple.

05:05.450 --> 05:07.610
We all know that what we can do is.

05:09.990 --> 05:10.290
Yeah.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.430
For each element.

05:15.420 --> 05:18.320
But each element, what we'll do is I'll simply go back.

05:18.330 --> 05:23.640
I'll check whether it's a crime or not in a or detect whether it's less than equal to or not.

05:23.790 --> 05:27.510
But in this, I don't have to check that it's already an increasing sequence in the input.

05:28.620 --> 05:34.080
I just have to check whether the current element and the previous element whose ending I want are cool

05:34.340 --> 05:34.710
or not.

05:34.920 --> 05:39.690
If they're not coping, I'll take the maximum ending rate to basically something like this.

05:40.320 --> 05:43.770
We have already discussed that affixes equals to max of.

05:44.840 --> 05:49.280
A phase where VI is less than X and ia of VI.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.750
But it is just as it can put.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.090
And a away from my ex.

06:01.170 --> 06:03.540
Registry is greater than one.

06:04.420 --> 06:05.910
Always very simple.

06:07.430 --> 06:10.640
Out of all those, I take the maximum one and I just simply stored it.

06:11.960 --> 06:18.560
For example, if I start with this, if I started with this two, then what I can see looking for the

06:18.560 --> 06:24.350
first one, it will be one only for three where I can see I go back and check whether is there any number

06:24.350 --> 06:27.730
whose disagree with three is greater than one eight.

06:28.010 --> 06:29.690
But we can see there's no such numbers.

06:29.810 --> 06:31.580
Again, it will be one what food?

06:31.850 --> 06:35.810
What cannot come after three because three and four to cooperate, but it can come after two.

06:36.140 --> 06:38.330
That means what is the best ending?

06:38.330 --> 06:39.590
The two can give it one.

06:39.590 --> 06:41.030
So one plus one is two.

06:41.330 --> 06:42.190
What about six?

06:42.490 --> 06:43.670
Six can come after three.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.840
It's going to go off two, four and six can also come after two.

06:47.420 --> 06:52.250
You just said all three options because you see three of six with all three is not one.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.630
What is the best option that success?

06:54.660 --> 06:59.220
It has this two, basically two plus one is Reno eight.

06:59.580 --> 07:02.640
And finally, we have nine nine.

07:03.330 --> 07:03.990
Okay, let me.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.410
What about nine?

07:06.420 --> 07:13.310
So nine can be after six, it can use six ending as well because we're just talking about edges in numbers

07:13.730 --> 07:13.970
eight.

07:15.710 --> 07:16.850
Can it come after four?

07:17.270 --> 07:19.040
No rate nine and four digits?

07:19.040 --> 07:21.880
It will be, but it can come up to three.

07:21.890 --> 07:22.280
Right.

07:22.700 --> 07:23.570
And it go after two.

07:23.690 --> 07:24.050
No.

07:24.230 --> 07:30.380
Eight out of these two options, what is the best ending that that nine is the time to take it.

07:30.380 --> 07:32.300
You take three, three plus one is four.

07:35.760 --> 07:36.870
Basically what's up?

07:37.500 --> 07:42.560
And also, we know that it's not necessarily that they will end on the last element only it can in anyway.

07:43.770 --> 07:45.930
So but in this case, it's ending on the last element.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.170
Worst dancer.

07:48.370 --> 07:48.770
Dancer.

07:48.780 --> 07:49.740
Two simple images.

07:50.700 --> 07:57.770
But so instead of checking whether it is increasing or not, I just checked whether they are better.

07:58.170 --> 08:00.250
They are cool, but I wasn't at all.

08:00.270 --> 08:01.560
So this was a brute force approach.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.540
But what will be the complexity of this?

08:04.110 --> 08:10.270
The complexity of this will be off and square because for every element I'm going back in the decree

08:10.290 --> 08:12.890
and moving forward, they.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.430
But guys, tell me, can there be a better approach?

08:16.700 --> 08:21.440
Because, of course, we are talking about computer programming right now, and this will be slightly

08:21.440 --> 08:24.050
more tricky going forward.

08:24.350 --> 08:26.150
So this was the basic brute force approach.

08:26.480 --> 08:31.220
But of course, this won't work because the value of any standard above five inch square will be ten

08:31.220 --> 08:34.320
to the power ten, which won't appear in 2 seconds.

08:34.340 --> 08:35.060
It will take more.

08:35.330 --> 08:36.200
We all know this raid.

08:38.030 --> 08:38.300
Yeah.

08:39.740 --> 08:45.200
So it's a slightly computer programming touch here that I'm taking because I want you to understand

08:45.200 --> 08:48.550
this problem will help you understand many of the problems said.

08:48.980 --> 08:50.660
I want to do it in a better approach.

08:51.480 --> 08:54.830
So what I can do is simple, right?

08:55.040 --> 08:55.820
Let me let me.

08:56.170 --> 08:57.070
Let me read this.

08:58.740 --> 08:59.050
Or.

09:09.180 --> 09:15.840
But tell me, why did I see that Siskin come off the forum and OP six can be appended to four in the

09:15.840 --> 09:21.180
sequence because six users are two, three and six of course.

09:21.510 --> 09:23.700
But let's only talk about primary reasons.

09:24.060 --> 09:28.230
If I want to find out whether it's common, why, I'd go promote an art.

09:28.620 --> 09:31.700
And what I'll do is I can simply find out what I'm doing.

09:31.710 --> 09:37.080
This affects I can simply find out prime to the survey and check whether any one of the primary readers

09:37.080 --> 09:37.950
is common or not.

09:38.340 --> 09:39.180
That will help me write.

09:39.180 --> 09:42.330
I don't have to find out all the diseases, only the primary business.

09:42.360 --> 09:45.930
Therefore it's what I eventually mean it.

09:46.050 --> 09:51.540
And similarly for food, I have to as a primary viewer and we see that two is common in both.

09:51.570 --> 09:57.450
That means six and four can never be prime numbers because they have a prime divisor in common.

09:58.110 --> 09:58.400
Right?

09:59.450 --> 10:01.190
So I'll be using this approach.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.560
Of rhyme devises.

10:03.570 --> 10:08.960
And if to add to elements of steam primary visas, I will simply.

10:11.240 --> 10:11.750
Abandoned.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.710
And now how will I check this book?

10:14.870 --> 10:15.560
I won't check.

10:16.500 --> 10:17.460
Or the two elements.

10:17.820 --> 10:19.140
Okay, let's look at this.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.810
Look, I'm just listing down the primary beauties of.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.870
Two, four, three, three, four, four, two, two, four.

10:25.870 --> 10:28.120
Tickets to win 349.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.110
It is the.

10:30.290 --> 10:32.180
Well, it's just trying to send this.

10:32.180 --> 10:35.180
And it's a very, very nice approach.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
What I've done is I have just I have all the primary videos of all these values that are there in this

10:43.000 --> 10:43.300
area.

10:43.660 --> 10:49.780
And I can easily find out the prime leaders of all these values and why a root of a every square root

10:49.780 --> 10:53.770
of these values and square root is the time complexity.

10:53.770 --> 10:54.430
We all know this.

10:56.090 --> 11:03.580
But if you look, you might also be new to the course and you might also not know that it's a it can

11:03.580 --> 11:04.970
be achieved using number three.

11:05.260 --> 11:06.750
But let's talk about it later.

11:06.790 --> 11:07.060
Right.

11:07.450 --> 11:09.280
This this will not affect a solution.

11:11.350 --> 11:12.970
But these are the primary uses of it.

11:13.600 --> 11:13.990
Now.

11:20.450 --> 11:21.350
And just give me a sec.

11:21.350 --> 11:22.760
In the table is key.

11:23.640 --> 11:23.920
Eight.

11:30.930 --> 11:32.670
Starting and get this.

11:33.240 --> 11:39.840
And this is an industry which is it will tell me what is the best standing for a prime to be accommodated.

11:40.970 --> 11:42.350
Best ending.

11:44.260 --> 11:45.190
For a primary reason.

11:51.580 --> 11:51.740
Right.

11:52.370 --> 11:54.670
What's the best ending for a family with that end in this?

11:54.960 --> 11:58.920
Right now, I have just to read this new entry.

11:58.930 --> 12:01.570
So let me quickly, you know, one, two, three.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.630
So during the night, not prime numbers and two entry, right?

12:04.780 --> 12:06.200
I'd have them zero one.

12:06.340 --> 12:09.790
So this is a primary, basically primary.

12:09.790 --> 12:10.120
Right.

12:10.930 --> 12:15.400
And this will tell me what's the best ending that a number has.

12:15.820 --> 12:19.300
And it also has to do with it has to fate, basically.

12:20.190 --> 12:23.490
Okay, let's go step by step before two.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.760
We know it will be one.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.650
That means the best ending.

12:26.800 --> 12:31.510
Now a prime number two can provide.

12:33.330 --> 12:37.200
Is what I what I'll do is I'll update one here as well.

12:38.530 --> 12:39.400
Just get to this point.

12:40.330 --> 12:43.450
What I'm doing is what these two achieved that.

12:44.550 --> 12:45.120
It's brand new.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.010
That is true, right?

12:46.020 --> 12:49.860
And the best ending of two initially was zero because we are just starting.

12:50.560 --> 12:59.370
So do you, as a prime TV user, can provide the best ending, which is one upgrade in both the series?

12:59.820 --> 13:00.780
And let's move to three.

13:01.600 --> 13:05.340
But I saw that he only has one primary visit rate.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.450
Of course, he's very eager to prove it.

13:08.510 --> 13:13.640
That is, if trip can be upended behind any number in this particular problem.

13:13.880 --> 13:19.730
It simply means they should have a common primary visa instead of finding that number.

13:20.030 --> 13:27.530
What I'm doing is I'm using these primary visas as a method to approach to that number.

13:28.100 --> 13:35.150
Basically, right now, three has how much it has zero we can easily see on the writing because the

13:35.150 --> 13:38.560
best ending that because apparently visa can provide is zero.

13:38.570 --> 13:39.980
So what else do we then simply have?

13:40.040 --> 13:40.580
Zero.

13:40.890 --> 13:43.430
I simply have one over here and an the 0 to 1.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.450
Full knowledge come to fort and inform.

13:48.470 --> 13:52.160
I see that only two is the primary visit of Fort eight.

13:52.550 --> 13:58.370
But if two is the only band with the fort, what's the best ending you can provide as a prime number

13:58.970 --> 13:59.170
eight?

13:59.660 --> 14:01.430
What it will do is what is this?

14:01.460 --> 14:03.140
Choosing the best ending?

14:03.740 --> 14:08.860
Who is a prime number is providing is one that means what?

14:08.900 --> 14:11.540
Wherever the best ending is, it's somewhere on the left.

14:11.540 --> 14:11.900
Right.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.230
Of course, I know we can see it's on two, but it's somewhere on the left.

14:15.770 --> 14:21.650
And it is it it has to with its primary reason, I can connect that primary visit to the current primary

14:21.650 --> 14:23.010
reserve to it.

14:23.180 --> 14:25.130
So what I'll do is I'll simply update here.

14:26.890 --> 14:27.110
Why?

14:27.130 --> 14:30.520
Because the best ending to can give me is one.

14:31.210 --> 14:34.830
And right now, this also has to whether to do business.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.400
So I increase the talent rate.

14:37.530 --> 14:37.770
Here.

14:37.770 --> 14:45.150
I'm trying to connect using primary business and not directly numbers and simply update this to that.

14:45.150 --> 14:51.210
The best ending no primary user as a tool can provide is to and which is on this for.

14:52.270 --> 14:52.870
Oh, no.

14:53.230 --> 14:53.430
Yeah.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.980
Now let's understand this part, this six.

14:59.740 --> 15:01.450
Six has to do with this.

15:01.450 --> 15:08.440
One is two women with one is two and the other is 3 to 6 can connect with any of the numbers which has

15:08.440 --> 15:10.690
to in its primary visit or to the end.

15:10.690 --> 15:11.680
It's going to be with a rate.

15:12.460 --> 15:17.650
What's the best ending that six can get if it tries to connect with two?

15:18.130 --> 15:22.240
As a prime debater, it will get the ending is right.

15:22.500 --> 15:27.060
So this tool gives its ending the best ending that is given to the six two.

15:27.520 --> 15:32.830
And if it tries to connect with someone with which who has it in its prime duties, then it will be

15:32.830 --> 15:33.070
one.

15:34.160 --> 15:38.520
But that reconnection, this disconnection is actually.

15:39.430 --> 15:40.660
And going to with the six eight.

15:40.660 --> 15:42.610
So we know right through you can connect with six.

15:42.970 --> 15:43.210
Yeah.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.920
What the best ending the trees providing.

15:45.920 --> 15:46.430
It's fun.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.190
Which ending would you like to take?

15:49.190 --> 15:50.240
Would you like to take?

15:50.480 --> 15:52.460
It was best ending or three the best ending.

15:53.520 --> 15:57.240
It would like to do with anything because it has a higher leant rate.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.000
So what it will do.

15:59.010 --> 15:59.790
It will do.

15:59.790 --> 16:00.240
And.

16:01.360 --> 16:01.900
Now.

16:02.820 --> 16:07.980
The answer here will be three because two lending is what is existing, plus one because six is already

16:07.980 --> 16:08.460
included.

16:08.460 --> 16:08.730
Right.

16:09.150 --> 16:11.100
It's very similar to the previous problem.

16:12.660 --> 16:13.920
Of the earliest problem rate.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.390
The best answer if the current.

16:17.090 --> 16:18.460
I think I don't have to write it.

16:18.650 --> 16:22.430
The best answer if current element is considered just like the alligator problem.

16:22.820 --> 16:24.980
It's why I'm taking this now.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.440
Now, here's the important part.

16:29.460 --> 16:30.720
Let's go slow in this.

16:31.320 --> 16:34.320
So they know we were on six and we saw the best ending that.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.160
X provides.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.620
This tree is indeed the best ending.

16:39.620 --> 16:40.730
The tool also provides.

16:41.750 --> 16:42.230
This to.

16:44.380 --> 16:45.490
This, too, is a brain.

16:46.270 --> 16:48.040
It provides this best ending, which is three.

16:49.130 --> 16:53.450
And isn't that also the best handling that this trio also provides?

16:55.170 --> 16:57.960
So if there's a sequence which ends.

16:59.260 --> 17:00.670
Of leant four on six.

17:01.810 --> 17:05.890
Then any other number we just do in its brainteaser can use this six.

17:06.730 --> 17:13.630
Any other than a movie which has three in its primary music can also use this six as the previous number.

17:13.930 --> 17:16.180
It can also use it for basically.

17:17.460 --> 17:19.410
This story will also be updated to.

17:22.550 --> 17:24.140
Uh, I hope you got my point.

17:26.320 --> 17:26.690
I am.

17:28.080 --> 17:36.590
Because initially if if this success tree it means this time with the prime is also providing tree as

17:36.600 --> 17:41.490
a tent and this tree is also providing it as a tree as it's in its land.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.490
Well, now, what's the next thing?

17:44.760 --> 17:45.420
The next thing is.

17:46.930 --> 17:52.810
Now let's come on nine and let's find the best ending the nine in nine as a prime loser with just three

17:53.290 --> 17:53.590
eight.

17:54.860 --> 17:55.100
So.

17:57.280 --> 18:00.730
This three can use the best ending the tree provides.

18:01.780 --> 18:02.090
Eight.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.170
What is the best ending that tributes?

18:04.180 --> 18:05.170
It's three right now.

18:05.660 --> 18:06.670
Three plus one is for.

18:08.580 --> 18:10.470
It is providing the best training from here.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.340
Similarly, this ending is actually coming from this too.

18:14.550 --> 18:15.180
Which is it?

18:15.750 --> 18:16.170
And.

18:18.360 --> 18:19.110
Let me.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.590
Basically it's of in that area.

18:22.590 --> 18:30.510
I'll just simply make this area and then it's coming from you edges into an adjacent to again and then

18:30.510 --> 18:31.380
this are just entry.

18:31.950 --> 18:33.270
I hope you're getting the point.

18:33.990 --> 18:37.330
If so, here we are just playing with primary with this and nothing.

18:37.330 --> 18:37.590
It's.

18:40.900 --> 18:41.200
Okay.

18:41.250 --> 18:41.970
So let's see.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.750
It was not six.

18:43.950 --> 18:46.590
And it was also not nine at 16.

18:46.590 --> 18:47.190
Some values.

18:47.430 --> 18:48.630
I just want to add one more prime.

18:48.630 --> 18:49.440
And there's nothing else.

18:49.980 --> 18:50.940
It's selective.

18:52.330 --> 18:54.950
One more time, which is by eight.

18:56.110 --> 18:56.980
The fire will come again.

18:56.980 --> 18:58.570
So this becomes a de.

18:59.460 --> 19:05.340
And, uh, let's say it is three and five and, uh.

19:07.990 --> 19:09.190
It's going to fortify.

19:11.030 --> 19:14.780
It is the 40 babies, but only those of three and five is for it.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.760
So that I know what will happen is a lecture.

19:16.760 --> 19:21.050
We are here on 30 and we can easily see that the best ending.

19:22.040 --> 19:22.850
Let me raise this.

19:27.860 --> 19:32.870
So we know there are two wars giving, one doing the best training, and three was giving.

19:32.870 --> 19:33.650
One is the best training.

19:34.010 --> 19:36.710
Now here we can see two is giving.

19:36.710 --> 19:37.730
Two is the best ending.

19:38.230 --> 19:42.110
He's giving one of the best earning, but five is giving zero the best training for now.

19:42.500 --> 19:47.390
Well, this study will, of course, try to take this to an add three to here, etc..

19:47.930 --> 19:48.770
Now what will happen?

19:50.040 --> 19:53.670
Now all these values, the values of all these prime numbers will change.

19:54.840 --> 19:55.140
Eight.

19:55.650 --> 19:56.820
What will be the values here?

19:56.970 --> 20:04.740
The value here will be three, three and three, four, five is five because now the next number can

20:04.740 --> 20:05.250
connect.

20:05.760 --> 20:06.630
Using five is.

20:07.630 --> 20:07.810
Eight.

20:08.410 --> 20:12.160
That means 45 can come after 30 via because it has a five.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.560
This five needs to also be updated.

20:15.430 --> 20:16.390
I hope you're are getting this.

20:17.740 --> 20:25.960
And similarly, guys try and apply the same logic to the next input and see what's the best answer you're

20:25.960 --> 20:26.320
getting.

20:27.570 --> 20:28.350
It doesn't put.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.200
Do some rough work and see how the connections are being made.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.600
Just use the prime divisors of those numbers.

20:34.990 --> 20:36.550
Actually, these numbers do not matter.

20:37.030 --> 20:43.480
They just use the primary visas and and priority of those of any of the numbers are very less.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.930
I think they're less than log in as well for any number.

20:49.160 --> 20:52.640
So yeah, that's the whole point of this problem.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.470
And we'll call it in part.

20:54.920 --> 20:55.250
Thanks.
