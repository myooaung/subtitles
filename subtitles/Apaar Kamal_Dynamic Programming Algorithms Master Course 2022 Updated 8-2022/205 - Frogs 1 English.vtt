WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:00.960
Yes.

00:00.970 --> 00:06.610
So it's time to start the equality contest and let's solve all these problems one by one.

00:06.910 --> 00:07.920
We'll be using both.

00:08.890 --> 00:13.960
Yeah, we'll be using, first of all, these three steps one, two and three that have already finding

00:13.960 --> 00:14.770
all the problems.

00:15.130 --> 00:20.380
And then in some of the problems and solved both top down and bottom of approach very well wherever.

00:20.380 --> 00:24.340
I think that yes, it will be a little tough for students to do it.

00:24.720 --> 00:28.420
And so I'll call it out and we'll summit all these problems.

00:29.080 --> 00:29.380
Great.

00:29.650 --> 00:32.800
What I expect from you when I solve these problems is that.

00:33.890 --> 00:39.170
Wesley, I want you to go over the problems and buy one yourself and read them out.

00:39.470 --> 00:45.650
Try to solve them yourself first, and then, like, even if you have solved it, just come back and

00:45.770 --> 00:51.110
watch the video and then we'll do it my way and we'll solve all the problems.

00:51.470 --> 00:57.470
Well, let's begin with the first problem, so you can easily come to this page by typing it on Google

00:57.470 --> 00:59.300
Education or deep context and go there.

00:59.300 --> 01:04.190
You'll get the first link, you'll have these ask here and let's open the first problem.

01:04.190 --> 01:05.570
Which program?

01:05.710 --> 01:05.960
One.

01:06.410 --> 01:08.000
Right, so yeah.

01:09.030 --> 01:15.180
Who via like Edgardo read by chose this because it has all types of problems, all difficulty types

01:15.180 --> 01:19.380
of problems too and ability and some different ways of going to anime programming.

01:19.890 --> 01:23.100
And the most important part is that in a coder you'll have.

01:24.230 --> 01:26.920
Precise problem statements.

01:26.930 --> 01:30.200
You won't have much stories revolving around it.

01:30.710 --> 01:31.590
It will be direct.

01:31.610 --> 01:32.670
You have been given this.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.120
You have to find this.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.180
These are the constants.

01:35.420 --> 01:36.180
This is the time.

01:36.260 --> 01:36.800
Solve it.

01:37.620 --> 01:40.680
So some precise problems because of an event.

01:40.820 --> 01:43.310
We are trying to educate our self interview.

01:43.430 --> 01:45.080
We are trying to learn something new.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.190
And we do not want to, you know, keep extra things in our mind.

01:49.190 --> 01:50.690
Some names and some other.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.350
Oh, stuff from the problem.

01:53.650 --> 01:55.000
We wanted it to be very simple.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.810
We want to understand the logic part and we want to move on it.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.590
So, yes, let's move on with this first problem.

02:03.010 --> 02:03.940
The pause, the video.

02:03.940 --> 02:04.570
Read it out.

02:04.690 --> 02:05.650
Solve it yourself.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.360
I won't be repeating it again.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.340
And then I'll this it.

02:10.460 --> 02:17.440
The rhinestones numbered one twin broad for each either side of stone j grade.

02:17.950 --> 02:20.180
There is a frog who is initially on stone one.

02:21.390 --> 02:25.620
Even repeat the following action some number of times to reach stone and.

02:26.610 --> 02:32.580
If the frog is currently on store in a dump to store an A-plus one or A-plus to be the cost.

02:33.470 --> 02:40.810
Of etching minus x2 is incurred, which is a stone reliant on one particular stone.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.520
I can go do stone I plus one or I can go too soon.

02:43.520 --> 02:51.050
I blister eight and the cost which is incurred in jumping is equal to at two minus e.g. the difference

02:51.050 --> 02:57.200
between the heights of stones need the absolute difference right now.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.370
What does it say?

02:58.970 --> 03:02.780
Find the minimum possible total costs incurred before the frog reaches.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.690
Born in great.

03:06.860 --> 03:09.410
So let's move on to some examples.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.480
Here we have four, ten, 30, 40.

03:12.500 --> 03:12.880
Right.

03:12.920 --> 03:13.430
So.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.100
Let me quickly go over this example once.

03:18.310 --> 03:18.580
All.

03:18.640 --> 03:19.990
Ten 1340.

03:23.460 --> 03:25.590
So here we have this 410.

03:27.570 --> 03:31.940
And 40, 40 and 20 days.

03:32.460 --> 03:37.770
Initially, he's on 118 to let me make this small.

03:38.930 --> 03:40.520
Eddie of face for.

03:41.690 --> 03:43.290
Well, he's an Italian stone.

03:44.530 --> 03:45.170
When they.

03:45.700 --> 03:52.960
What I like, what I do is what will be my one step in solving a recursive programming problem.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.130
It's a forming a state.

03:54.260 --> 03:55.980
They will form a state for place.

03:56.860 --> 03:58.570
So here, I'll have this.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.120
Areas of area.

04:02.270 --> 04:03.800
So ffi will represent.

04:04.920 --> 04:05.820
What is it for fight?

04:06.570 --> 04:07.740
What does caution demand?

04:07.830 --> 04:08.100
Right.

04:08.100 --> 04:13.950
So the question demands the minimum possible total costs incurred before the frog registering it.

04:15.420 --> 04:17.790
So what is FFI in this case?

04:18.600 --> 04:24.740
I can be easily formed from this if I want f of and to be the final answer.

04:24.750 --> 04:27.990
If let's say f of an is final answer.

04:28.230 --> 04:33.510
Last answer that I need in watcher to f of and contain it should contain the minimum possible total

04:33.510 --> 04:37.080
cost incurred before the frog registrant and need.

04:37.230 --> 04:38.160
So what is for FY?

04:39.510 --> 04:40.620
Simple minimum.

04:42.030 --> 04:42.720
Possible.

04:45.790 --> 04:46.310
It will do.

04:49.260 --> 04:49.920
Incurred.

04:53.070 --> 04:53.730
Before.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.670
Frog reaches.

05:00.740 --> 05:01.970
Simple as that, right?

05:03.120 --> 05:10.440
So what is the cost to guys when frog is at index zero or they're indexing at one base and it mutates

05:10.440 --> 05:11.790
one, two, three and four?

05:13.110 --> 05:14.190
At Index Fund.

05:14.580 --> 05:19.710
What is the total cost that a frog has initially is on stage one only.

05:19.710 --> 05:20.010
Right.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.230
So he'll have a cost of zero.

05:23.130 --> 05:26.340
It should be very clear that in Italy the frog is on.

05:30.960 --> 05:31.410
One.

05:33.330 --> 05:36.360
That means he does not have any ghost.

05:37.290 --> 05:38.080
What does this mean?

05:38.100 --> 05:39.900
Let's think of this in a different way.

05:40.350 --> 05:43.040
The best guesses based guesses mean only one thing that.

05:43.050 --> 05:43.380
Okay.

05:43.680 --> 05:49.470
If the end is lent, if there was only one strong, what would have been the answer?

05:50.420 --> 05:51.480
It should be zero.

05:51.820 --> 05:54.860
Right now, guys, let's come down to the.

05:55.710 --> 05:59.700
In the problem statement, it has been given that a frog is currently on stony.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.910
He can jump do one, two plus one or plus two.

06:03.360 --> 06:03.660
Right.

06:04.020 --> 06:10.440
What I'll do is I just take the opposite if I am on some index, i.e. the frog can come from r u minus

06:10.440 --> 06:11.220
one or I.

06:12.610 --> 06:17.020
Yeah, but if I'm on index, I can come from a minus one.

06:17.940 --> 06:20.310
Or he can come from a minus.

06:21.640 --> 06:22.960
You ain't.

06:24.050 --> 06:24.710
So yeah.

06:24.800 --> 06:31.370
So right now I'm moving in a tabulation form and after this, we'll move in a kind of dropdown menu

06:31.370 --> 06:32.480
right into Oblong.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.880
And we have to start from the end and from the first.

06:35.330 --> 06:40.820
We will solve all the problems, all the ways, just like stay there with me, right?

06:41.630 --> 06:46.700
So when I'm on index two ways, then at two I can come from one.

06:48.100 --> 06:51.430
Eight from one I can go to do basically, but there's no index called zero.

06:51.430 --> 06:55.150
So this index two has only one option that is coming from index one.

06:55.780 --> 06:59.860
So I to the frog can jump to index two from index one only.

07:00.410 --> 07:01.740
What will the total cost case.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.220
The total cost will be very simple.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.990
The total cost from.

07:05.930 --> 07:08.480
But evolve two will be equal to.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.690
And for one, that means what was the minimum cost reaching?

07:12.690 --> 07:13.730
One eight?

07:17.010 --> 07:17.760
Edge of two.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.650
Minus edge of one.

07:20.530 --> 07:22.090
It's absolute value, basically.

07:23.520 --> 07:26.970
Right, because this wasn't caused from where I'm coming to.

07:27.260 --> 07:30.680
So I'm not worried about our team doing it.

07:31.470 --> 07:34.530
I'm not worried about how it came to index fund.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.060
That's what the piece about.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.880
You don't have to worry about those steps.

07:39.030 --> 07:40.590
You have to worry about only one step.

07:41.130 --> 07:45.900
And you don't have to say, okay, from an index to I can come from F of one then.

07:46.770 --> 07:47.100
Yeah.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.290
But you don't have to worry about two steps.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.130
What do I mean?

07:50.130 --> 07:50.670
Is this?

07:50.670 --> 07:50.970
That.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.130
Let's see.

07:53.550 --> 07:59.450
I'm moving on to index for an index where I can come from index three and index two four.

07:59.490 --> 08:00.990
Then when I'm calculating down.

08:00.990 --> 08:04.020
So for index four, I don't have to worry about index fund.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.750
That's what optimates obstruction means, right?

08:07.780 --> 08:12.580
We all know that to calculate forward, we need only three in do.

08:12.790 --> 08:15.520
But to calculate three, we might need to invent.

08:16.530 --> 08:16.720
Hey.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.610
But in for we are not worried about how to go to the next one.

08:20.670 --> 08:25.400
We don't take one in that it goes in relation for food aid.

08:25.410 --> 08:27.030
So we have to be optimal always.

08:27.420 --> 08:29.460
We don't have to go to step stone.

08:29.460 --> 08:30.840
We have to just move one step.

08:30.840 --> 08:31.110
Don't.

08:31.470 --> 08:37.200
So those one step down are some problems because those are problems are problems in themselves.

08:37.950 --> 08:38.130
They.

08:39.520 --> 08:43.270
Sitting next to him coming from a Knicks one only that means I have only one part, so I'll just take

08:43.270 --> 08:44.830
the answer and edit here.

08:46.270 --> 08:47.440
But it will be how much?

08:48.100 --> 08:51.370
Zero plus 30 minus ten with just 21.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.020
Now an index three.

08:53.020 --> 08:53.980
Now I'm on index three.

08:53.980 --> 08:58.360
So if I want index three, I can either come from index one or I can come from index.

08:58.690 --> 09:00.550
You're doing three, right?

09:01.270 --> 09:04.090
So what should be the answer goes for index three.

09:04.510 --> 09:09.580
Now I have two options at the from index one or from index to the both of these options will have their

09:09.580 --> 09:13.540
own cost, whatever will be the minimum course that I'll take.

09:13.540 --> 09:18.670
Right, because I want to find out the minimum possible total costs incurred before F of three.

09:18.940 --> 09:21.580
We'll have a four for one plus a.

09:23.470 --> 09:24.900
Three minus one.

09:26.110 --> 09:33.540
Eight and F of three, we can also have F of two plus s three minus edge to exist.

09:33.820 --> 09:37.300
That means from from one end of both we can go to three.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.860
What's the best?

09:39.440 --> 09:40.210
What's the best?

09:41.170 --> 09:46.210
Price was the minimum costing them will take that was the minimum in these two guys let's calculate

09:46.210 --> 09:51.760
this for when is zero plus it's three minus one is 30.

09:52.790 --> 09:54.110
And of.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.610
Who is 20 plus ten.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.040
It is also 20 plus.

10:01.040 --> 10:07.760
And because 40 -30 stem again will have the of 30 as the minimum, we can pick any of them eight because

10:07.760 --> 10:09.290
we have being worried about dances.

10:10.130 --> 10:13.280
So I just did the one thing that came to my mind.

10:13.490 --> 10:17.600
You can also trace back these answers from where are these answers coming from?

10:18.390 --> 10:21.410
I'll show you how to do that in different problems.

10:22.410 --> 10:25.470
And then let's talk about the last valley which is ever fought.

10:26.470 --> 10:30.250
Read What is a44 in a4444?

10:30.280 --> 10:35.190
We can come from either two or we can come from either the eight.

10:35.230 --> 10:39.280
So at four we can come from three or two, only eight.

10:39.310 --> 10:40.510
So what is the minimum among them?

10:40.510 --> 10:44.170
What F of three is 30 plus ten plus 20?

10:44.380 --> 10:45.280
It will be 50.

10:46.200 --> 10:46.590
And.

10:47.340 --> 10:47.610
Yeah.

10:47.640 --> 10:48.630
30 plus 20.

10:49.200 --> 10:56.280
Or we can have 20 plus ten, which is F of two plus the difference between two and four.

10:56.730 --> 10:57.570
It just ain't right.

10:57.750 --> 11:01.840
So it is 30 here and it is 30 plus 2050 here.

11:02.380 --> 11:03.420
It was the minimum guys.

11:03.570 --> 11:04.290
The minimum is.

11:05.620 --> 11:05.980
30.

11:06.740 --> 11:08.960
Any of 30 and 58.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.360
So what's the total?

11:12.200 --> 11:12.680
Hmm?

11:16.610 --> 11:23.420
It's terribly strong and this is 20 plus ten for the about the total words the final value when it reached

11:23.420 --> 11:25.190
for it is 30.

11:25.820 --> 11:30.130
This is the minimum possible total cost and good before the authorities like it.

11:30.170 --> 11:36.320
So here you can easily notice this part that f for it was dependent on f of tree and f of two.

11:37.700 --> 11:38.030
Right.

11:38.420 --> 11:40.750
And F3 was depending on if off to an F1.

11:42.360 --> 11:48.030
I mean, for, for I only want these two states and not the blue states because optimal substructure.

11:48.570 --> 11:53.340
And here we have overlapping so problems we don't we don't have to calculate F of two again and again.

11:53.340 --> 11:54.870
Of course, this is a small error rate.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.520
It's very similar to the European economies.

11:57.780 --> 12:03.300
There are trees very similar to the Fibonacci numbers because in that also we are dependent to states.

12:03.300 --> 12:08.280
But in fact, when I give numbers, it was a summation of those two states and it is the minimum of

12:08.700 --> 12:10.830
those two states plus the cost incurred.

12:12.150 --> 12:12.450
Eight.

12:13.570 --> 12:13.900
So.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.840
Yeah, let's call this out and let's stick.

12:18.300 --> 12:18.570
Yeah.

12:18.630 --> 12:19.000
Teddy.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.670
So let's copy this.

12:22.420 --> 12:25.180
The estate and ordered.

12:25.180 --> 12:25.840
You know what?

12:25.840 --> 12:27.470
I'm fishing it.

12:28.490 --> 12:30.010
But how can I do that?

12:32.400 --> 12:32.700
Yes.

12:32.790 --> 12:35.850
And is incredible for you agenda for four.

12:36.380 --> 12:42.390
It's given me so that it doesn't exceed any integer value dancer doesn't exceed in integer value because

12:42.390 --> 12:44.460
it will only go detected by our name.

12:45.030 --> 12:48.690
But yes, we don't have to worry about that because we have already taken in this long running.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.410
8000 yeah.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.840
So initially we have nn it's input in.

12:56.110 --> 13:00.250
Uh, let's say it's in the dumps right now.

13:00.250 --> 13:00.760
I'm taking.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.330
Zero based the indexing rate.

13:04.170 --> 13:10.980
I'd say it's input all of this and right now I have to integrate the deep values for all the states.

13:11.570 --> 13:12.390
They need to be.

13:12.390 --> 13:14.100
We've already seen that because.

13:16.660 --> 13:20.800
If I don't do, then what I do what I do care only one steward they're dependent on.

13:21.430 --> 13:23.110
So f00.

13:23.380 --> 13:24.360
We already know that.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.260
And let's also fill.

13:27.660 --> 13:28.290
F of one.

13:30.090 --> 13:30.390
Great.

13:30.840 --> 13:31.590
So give me a second.

13:32.250 --> 13:32.550
Yep.

13:32.610 --> 13:33.660
So what was.

13:34.870 --> 13:35.590
For when you.

13:36.740 --> 13:37.940
We never when we had.

13:40.810 --> 13:42.880
F of zero plus.

13:43.450 --> 13:44.530
Which is zero, of course.

13:45.100 --> 13:45.910
Edge of one.

13:49.910 --> 13:51.560
Look, there's a problem in this.

13:52.160 --> 13:55.760
Let's if anything goes to one who and is not equal to one.

13:55.790 --> 13:56.510
So no problem.

13:56.690 --> 13:56.960
Eight.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.660
I don't have to check whether each one is there or not.

14:00.170 --> 14:02.690
It is at your one minus edge of zero.

14:03.020 --> 14:04.040
And this is here.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.210
It will be an absolute value.

14:05.820 --> 14:08.360
Well, that means I can jump from 0 to 1.

14:09.330 --> 14:17.840
Now let's include all the jumps from school to lesson in late what will be epiphany, but not if it

14:17.850 --> 14:18.510
will really be.

14:19.740 --> 14:20.560
Don't get confused.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.020
Honey bees have only.

14:23.570 --> 14:28.630
But I'm not feeling any of the value because I'm simply overriding the normal stuff here.

14:28.870 --> 14:37.150
So it is deep your physical to minimum of deep of I managed to lose absolute value of etch i i you minus

14:37.150 --> 14:40.300
one minus etch a comma.

14:41.890 --> 14:42.850
So this is the first party.

14:43.030 --> 14:45.070
This is a foursome that is I'm minus one jump.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.630
And what is this, a condemned?

14:47.740 --> 14:48.640
I managed to jump.

14:48.640 --> 14:52.590
It will be the prime minister who actually managed to minus.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.700
I take that full value, of course.

14:55.670 --> 14:56.480
And yeah.

14:56.660 --> 15:00.170
So the minimum of these will be my final answer.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.100
The debate always goes.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.830
You can see the debate being filled and the previous debates being called eight and 12 simply see out

15:07.830 --> 15:11.940
NDP often minus one because I'm taking it as a zero base indexing stuff.

15:12.700 --> 15:13.710
Maybe you have 30.

15:13.740 --> 15:14.940
Let's check for some other.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.430
Here we have.

15:20.200 --> 15:20.560
Zero.

15:20.740 --> 15:21.160
Great.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.650
And let's check for this finally.

15:26.390 --> 15:27.150
42.

15:27.190 --> 15:33.440
I hope you understood this part, that if I am on some I instead of upgrading the forward part, which

15:33.440 --> 15:38.650
is I plus one and I plus to this update, this check from where I can come to this particular index,

15:38.690 --> 15:41.990
what is my recursively it is from here or here.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.570
You don't have to think of two steps.

15:44.870 --> 15:46.010
Okay, if I'm coming from here.

15:46.010 --> 15:47.000
So where will it come?

15:47.330 --> 15:52.850
Where it will come is itself up some problem that will be solved using dynamic programming.

15:53.600 --> 15:59.840
So generally what happens with me whenever I, whenever I like going a problem and there are lots of

15:59.840 --> 16:06.560
if else is that if this then this as this then this then again if as I just say that, okay, this is

16:06.560 --> 16:09.920
our dynamic programming problem because there are so many fences.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.810
So I just have to worry about one event.

16:11.810 --> 16:15.230
One, it's not about two Nestor lives and two nested edges.

16:16.260 --> 16:16.550
Great.

16:17.510 --> 16:17.840
Great.

16:18.450 --> 16:20.330
So this is the first part.

16:21.520 --> 16:24.880
And this was the top down approach, guys.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.960
Well, and now let me call it out in the bottom of fashion.

16:30.330 --> 16:32.580
So should I do it in this?

16:33.600 --> 16:34.010
Only.

16:34.680 --> 16:40.680
No, let's do in the honor code before they submitted on Ecuador and submitted over here.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.970
I'm not sure about whether I should come into this or not.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.200
Let me summitted and check.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.170
Yeah.

16:47.170 --> 16:48.880
So what we have here is frog one.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.020
And reading for judging it.

16:52.910 --> 16:56.540
We have a combination error rate, so I think I should.

16:58.100 --> 16:58.820
Coming out.

17:06.240 --> 17:06.420
Here.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.220
I heard C++ 14 initially.

17:08.970 --> 17:09.300
Okay.

17:10.050 --> 17:13.200
Let me quickly check my compilation error if it is.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.270
Include its fine art funk.

17:21.590 --> 17:22.490
It shouldn't be an error.

17:23.530 --> 17:23.970
Okay.

17:23.980 --> 17:26.380
Let me move it above you.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.690
C++ clank.

17:35.630 --> 17:36.200
No training.

17:36.460 --> 17:36.760
Okay.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.980
So it got passed in preliminary segments.

17:39.010 --> 17:40.960
The problem was about language.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.850
But we can see the execution down 31 milliseconds.

17:49.270 --> 17:52.660
Now, what we'll do is we'll try to do it in the bottom of fashion.

17:52.990 --> 17:53.980
So it's the first problem.

17:53.980 --> 17:55.480
So I'm doing it for the ways.

17:56.140 --> 17:59.260
Let me open new one and let's.

18:01.180 --> 18:01.930
Poppy this.

18:04.020 --> 18:04.710
Wasted.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.690
And yeah, the commute is this one you guys have taken then.

18:08.690 --> 18:13.820
But yeah, what I need is I need a vector, which will be the memo vector, so it should be integer

18:13.820 --> 18:13.970
today.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.710
It has to be stored in digits.

18:16.520 --> 18:22.310
So before calling people, we will simply memo what you say is minus one, because minus one can never

18:22.310 --> 18:22.910
be the answer.

18:23.480 --> 18:24.440
What is the length of this?

18:24.500 --> 18:25.730
It is and.

18:26.650 --> 18:29.320
It'd be like I'm taking everything zero waste and mixing.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.690
Now let's write this function called.

18:32.920 --> 18:33.280
AP.

18:34.670 --> 18:36.860
So I'll be passing on end.

18:37.730 --> 18:43.190
How does all this simple see out VPN Norton and minus one because.

18:44.070 --> 18:45.810
Starting from zero enix's.

18:47.440 --> 18:48.880
So we laid the best guess this little.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.500
Let's think of this deep.

18:50.530 --> 18:50.860
So.

18:51.800 --> 18:59.540
And minus one, I will be I will come from either n minus two or an minus one for this particular and

18:59.810 --> 19:05.390
the struggle about this particular in well I'm coming at the from if yeah so let's say answers equals

19:05.390 --> 19:10.070
to P and minus two plus absolute value of.

19:11.070 --> 19:12.180
And minus.

19:13.140 --> 19:15.840
Two, which is at Jovian minus two.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.280
Again, guys, again, I have a problem.

19:19.470 --> 19:22.530
So instead of taking action here, I have to it globally.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.960
Okay, so let's call it from the starting.

19:25.680 --> 19:30.240
Well, then I'll show you how I could when I do a bottom up approach.

19:31.230 --> 19:33.090
What I do is I generally take a constant.

19:36.340 --> 19:40.270
To define these make this that is to initialize these eddies.

19:41.560 --> 19:46.380
And yeah, so here we have end to the power of five land, right?

19:46.390 --> 19:50.320
If it was to introduce Buffer, we could have like two to it and so on.

19:51.220 --> 19:56.290
Here, let's take the first eddy action and the signal images memo.

19:57.490 --> 20:03.370
And well now let's input this so and see in RN and.

20:05.100 --> 20:05.970
Move forward.

20:07.390 --> 20:09.310
The in i.

20:10.500 --> 20:11.490
Rule from there.

20:11.550 --> 20:12.780
One have taken the input.

20:13.280 --> 20:18.090
So this is I mean, but right here I do I mean, what he said.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.560
It's a memo minus one size of.

20:23.990 --> 20:28.880
So it will send the whole memo to minus one of course raised some of you might be wondering that length

20:28.880 --> 20:34.010
of there is just six and we are setting the whole memo to be equal to minus one.

20:34.960 --> 20:35.980
Eight of them.

20:37.580 --> 20:43.700
So when we saw medical evidence in our test cases later, there can be some grotesque cases which everybody

20:43.700 --> 20:44.360
favors their.

20:46.430 --> 20:46.730
Lent.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.940
So I'm doing it for the kids, basically.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.340
So they're taking the land to be constant.

20:53.420 --> 20:58.430
So he will simply say, Scott, BP and minus one eight.

20:58.850 --> 21:00.510
So let's write this function.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.610
BP and.

21:02.990 --> 21:05.360
What a burglar and what are the solutions?

21:05.480 --> 21:07.190
The first is a.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.350
A, B and minus one.

21:10.590 --> 21:16.410
That means, tell me, what is the best answer for Libya and minus one eight for the minus one index

21:16.410 --> 21:22.080
and add the cost to coming to this index, which is n minus one minus at your current.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.260
Well, guys, this is the first.

21:28.360 --> 21:32.680
Because of religion that if I'm digging one jump, that means I'm coming from the B and minus one.

21:32.890 --> 21:35.080
It means I'm coming from an minus one index.

21:35.530 --> 21:38.810
And this is my Australian.

21:39.460 --> 21:41.110
Well, and what is the second one?

21:41.140 --> 21:47.320
So if, of course, if any is greater than or we can see if our minus two is greater than equal to zero

21:47.320 --> 21:48.250
because we have two.

21:48.250 --> 21:49.000
And in this case.

21:49.900 --> 21:50.220
Eight.

21:50.550 --> 21:55.480
So if, let's say four and is equal to one or zero, then I cannot use this.

21:55.840 --> 21:59.020
So I have to apply for certain constraints, some conditions.

21:59.900 --> 22:04.510
That is, if, if and minus two is greater than zero, then what I have to do is I have to say that

22:04.510 --> 22:12.520
okay, answer is minimum of answer, which was already calculated comma DP and minus two m coming from

22:12.520 --> 22:13.630
then minus two with index.

22:14.080 --> 22:18.700
And the cost is absolute value of edge of n, minus two minus at Jove.

22:18.700 --> 22:19.000
And.

22:21.950 --> 22:22.450
Well, guys.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.110
So why this?

22:24.350 --> 22:29.620
Because if I don't have this condition, then let's say, and Izzy goes to one, so.

22:29.630 --> 22:31.610
And minus two will be equal to minus one.

22:31.910 --> 22:37.850
H, I have to have this condition and we take it in the minimum of answer only assimilated an answer.

22:39.730 --> 22:39.990
Well.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.290
So what does the base case, guys?

22:41.380 --> 22:42.610
The base case is very simple.

22:42.610 --> 22:44.200
If anything goes to 0 to 10.

22:45.250 --> 22:45.560
Zero.

22:47.320 --> 22:47.610
30.

22:49.790 --> 22:52.310
So here again, we can see the 40, we get 40.

22:52.310 --> 22:57.890
But yes, we haven't applied memorization of how to apply memorization before calculating answer.

22:58.310 --> 22:58.570
Okay.

22:58.580 --> 22:59.360
That's the first video.

22:59.360 --> 23:02.630
So it might be a lot of new stuff in this.

23:02.990 --> 23:05.750
Let me show you another new stuff in it, which is.

23:08.180 --> 23:14.260
What I do is I will take answer to another variable of memory.

23:15.320 --> 23:21.890
Well, now, whatever I do in answer variable, if I say answer surplus surplus, it will be equal to

23:21.890 --> 23:25.070
memo and plus plus it will be same as this.

23:26.260 --> 23:29.260
It's kind of the altruism was actually there this.

23:29.730 --> 23:35.190
So basically there are two variables two different variables of the same address in the compiler aid.

23:35.640 --> 23:40.180
So here what I'll do is I'll simply say if on the naughty goes to minus one.

23:41.540 --> 23:42.140
Pertinence.

23:42.470 --> 23:44.810
Otherwise, this answer has been calculated.

23:44.810 --> 23:48.520
This is going on and I simply.

23:48.540 --> 23:48.910
You're not.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.750
So I don't have to talk.

23:50.960 --> 23:55.880
I don't have to say a memo and is equipped to answer in a way because answer is in the variable of memo.

23:56.660 --> 24:00.230
Everything is happening in memo eight and it's also readable.

24:00.950 --> 24:01.190
Well.

24:02.230 --> 24:06.190
So you can try this by taking different examples in your own compiler.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.150
How does this work?

24:08.320 --> 24:09.730
And yeah.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.420
No, I don't have to memorize it.

24:13.980 --> 24:15.870
Especially it's memories there.

24:15.870 --> 24:19.680
Only because not only is that variable, everything is being manipulated in the answer.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.560
Only that means memory itself is being changed.

24:23.330 --> 24:24.540
Well, so.

24:24.540 --> 24:25.830
Yeah, let's build this.

24:26.010 --> 24:27.650
So we've got 14 knowledge submitted.

24:31.220 --> 24:31.850
AP.

24:38.070 --> 24:38.750
And Summit.

24:42.920 --> 24:45.710
I did those these problems a long way back.

24:46.220 --> 24:46.520
Right.

24:46.550 --> 24:51.800
So you begin to work through their music inspired because they go to the stack is being called and a

24:51.800 --> 24:52.970
little more time will be taken.

24:52.970 --> 24:54.890
But yes, it's an oil installation.

24:55.310 --> 24:57.500
Ain't no state will be calculated to ways.

24:59.070 --> 24:59.490
And.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.960
Both of the solution borrowing solutions.

25:03.260 --> 25:07.730
The bottom up approach in which we are using for loops and filling in tabular form.

25:08.210 --> 25:12.710
And the second is this because of relation approach, which is also cool approach.

25:12.710 --> 25:19.910
I like this recursive approach because it's kind of more easy to code it, but there are limitations

25:19.910 --> 25:20.570
on both of these.

25:20.570 --> 25:24.230
So we'll face some problems and we'll discuss the limitations then.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.050
So thank you guys in the next part.
