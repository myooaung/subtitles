00:00.990 --> 00:01.710
Welcome, guys.

00:02.070 --> 00:03.570
Let's move on to the next problem.

00:04.320 --> 00:09.510
And yeah, in this problem, we will see we will see that.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.110
Yes, we did.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.190
Solving that problem.

00:11.190 --> 00:11.400
But.

00:12.850 --> 00:17.690
How is dynamic programming so constrained specific?

00:18.100 --> 00:19.630
It is so constraint tied.

00:19.630 --> 00:22.600
Basically, we always have.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.570
We going to have multiple ways of solving our time programming problem, right?

00:26.920 --> 00:32.860
But when we code it out, when we try to submit it, it should run within the time limit that we are

00:32.890 --> 00:33.280
given.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.280
And so it's constraint specific.

00:36.940 --> 00:39.160
So you understand, why am I saying solving this problem?

00:39.580 --> 00:42.220
So it's the problem statement is exactly the same.

00:42.220 --> 00:49.330
Not even a single line is change this only the only changes in the constraints that end is hundred as

00:49.330 --> 00:50.260
it was in the previous.

00:51.290 --> 00:56.510
But in previous, which is knapsack one, let's stick it out the next segment.

00:56.510 --> 01:01.640
What we have is weirdos tend to refer you and values us and add the boat name.

01:01.940 --> 01:04.280
But here what we can see is that.

01:05.430 --> 01:11.970
The weirdest ended the overnight alert post-World War five rate and values the standard of poverty in

01:11.970 --> 01:12.540
this case.

01:13.080 --> 01:18.180
But what we had was values was starting to do overnight when we bought it.

01:18.420 --> 01:21.330
This part, when we're recording this part, indexing.

01:21.330 --> 01:25.990
Wait, so it was like within the limits that was standard above a seven.

01:26.010 --> 01:30.600
But right now, if I try to summon this problem on this particular monster in specific.

01:32.650 --> 01:38.950
If I saw my dissertation on this constant specific problem and I'll get ten over 11 complexity.

01:38.950 --> 01:39.160
Why?

01:39.160 --> 01:39.460
Because.

01:39.460 --> 01:40.180
And isn't it what?

01:40.180 --> 01:41.620
We're standard of our name.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.800
We're distended the word name eight.

01:45.280 --> 01:49.060
So these many values we it's going to have.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.010
So I cannot risk it.

01:52.150 --> 01:53.410
Of course, this won't work, right?

01:53.410 --> 01:55.600
Because the poverty level is too much.

01:56.670 --> 01:57.950
How can we solve this?

01:58.310 --> 01:59.210
How can we do this?

02:00.570 --> 02:01.100
Problem.

02:01.110 --> 02:02.820
So I just suggest your to positively.

02:03.750 --> 02:04.350
Think about.

02:06.100 --> 02:15.040
Making V as an argument instead of weight i instead of w i now we should have var is an argument.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.490
It's a for you and I and think about this.

02:18.760 --> 02:19.330
Try to.

02:20.490 --> 02:25.710
Another, it will be like, I'm not sure that will work or not because I haven't submitted it, but

02:25.710 --> 02:28.830
I'll call it that way first and then we'll see.

02:29.910 --> 02:32.670
What are the different possible approaches to solve this problem?

02:36.910 --> 02:38.410
It's a little tricky problem, guys.

02:39.340 --> 02:40.510
I try and go slow.

02:41.230 --> 02:41.860
I'm not sure.

02:42.550 --> 02:42.730
Right.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.010
I to go very slow in this.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.070
So, yes.

02:51.250 --> 02:51.700
But not.

02:54.130 --> 03:00.490
I hope you all have been through a very classical problem which is upset some problem in the subsequent

03:00.490 --> 03:06.460
problem which we we're actually trying to figure out whether a particular subset of the given area has

03:06.460 --> 03:07.720
a specific some or not.

03:08.530 --> 03:10.570
And that's a very famous problem.

03:10.570 --> 03:15.190
And you all must have done it, which is a subset, some problem.

03:15.820 --> 03:16.120
Eight.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.980
So we'll be using the idea behind some of problem in this particular.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.250
Alicia eight.

03:24.490 --> 03:28.010
So what's the idea behind subscription problem for every industry?

03:28.010 --> 03:31.990
Are trying to find out whether this particular sum has been made or not.

03:32.200 --> 03:37.860
And we are doing that for all to some treat just like knapsack problem pick or don't take some values

03:37.870 --> 03:40.870
will change and will come to know whether that particular item is possible or not.

03:41.650 --> 03:42.880
In this, what happens is.

03:44.050 --> 03:45.320
We'll do the same thing, right?

03:45.360 --> 03:47.140
That will take a value.

03:47.410 --> 03:48.760
All we want is a value.

03:49.950 --> 03:50.220
Yeah.

03:50.490 --> 03:58.200
So either we take an item or we won't take an item, but we'll figure out it whether a particular value

03:58.440 --> 04:02.370
can be made by utilizing the items.

04:02.880 --> 04:03.040
Okay.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.270
So basically it's like, let me ride it out.

04:08.450 --> 04:10.670
Here we are really having a state which is deep.

04:11.510 --> 04:11.930
I.

04:12.870 --> 04:13.290
And.

04:16.000 --> 04:16.790
And it's quality.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.330
But what would really be aged to present it will represent.

04:21.310 --> 04:23.280
If it will be a billion people.

04:23.410 --> 04:23.750
Right?

04:23.780 --> 04:24.630
If the 400.

04:24.860 --> 04:25.880
If so.

04:25.990 --> 04:26.440
If.

04:27.770 --> 04:29.120
Or whether it.

04:29.980 --> 04:30.550
They'd better.

04:33.580 --> 04:34.060
Whether.

04:36.970 --> 04:37.570
Value.

04:38.670 --> 04:39.450
Did they?

04:39.470 --> 04:45.150
Today's a value here in Ireland exists whether value can be.

04:48.350 --> 04:48.980
By using.

04:54.670 --> 04:55.420
I index's.

04:57.540 --> 05:02.460
There's like a subset some problem surveys before moving on to this because as I said, it's a little

05:02.460 --> 05:02.880
tricky.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.010
I want you to understand the subset.

05:05.010 --> 05:05.640
Some problem.

05:06.480 --> 05:06.700
Eight.

05:07.290 --> 05:13.080
And the video is, I think, in the course itself, and you can easily take the video of the subsequent

05:13.080 --> 05:13.470
problem.

05:13.470 --> 05:14.580
And it's a very famous problem.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.560
It's a very easy problem of classical problem.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.500
So in this absurd some problem.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.580
Also we have the same thing.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.220
We have a billion DPD dependent.

05:23.030 --> 05:28.470
We tell them we show them that whether a particular sum is possible from the index or not we are doing

05:28.470 --> 05:33.000
is whether value j can be found using either indexes or not.

05:34.100 --> 05:34.310
I.

05:35.550 --> 05:36.540
So let's see how.

05:38.110 --> 05:38.860
Will this work?

05:39.220 --> 05:42.640
Because it's kind of very interesting and a little tricky, but I'll go slow.

05:44.020 --> 05:50.800
So let's take the first one, which again, guys, it is the 30 or 55, 68.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.130
So.

05:52.160 --> 05:52.570
30.

05:53.670 --> 05:54.390
450.

05:54.600 --> 06:00.600
See how a little change in the costume kind of completely changes our solution.

06:01.170 --> 06:04.080
833, 3450 and 560.

06:06.580 --> 06:09.040
Then making a table will fill the table.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.340
Just accepted some problem, I.

06:20.450 --> 06:21.450
So let's have photos.

06:21.470 --> 06:22.610
One will be an empty room.

06:24.290 --> 06:26.330
Is zero one, two, three.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.760
And what are the values here?

06:29.210 --> 06:35.000
So the values here that we have is 30, 50 and 60, right.

06:36.050 --> 06:40.790
So instead of tardy 1564 an hour, let me take.

06:43.590 --> 06:45.240
Let's think normal values, right?

06:45.720 --> 06:49.350
So I'm just removing zero for explanation purposes.

06:51.150 --> 06:53.070
So we have three, five and six as a values.

06:56.990 --> 06:58.700
And these are the words.

07:00.690 --> 07:04.500
Well so yeah so having here was a values so zero.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.790
And zero.

07:18.010 --> 07:20.890
Let's make the columns to the sum of the values.

07:21.340 --> 07:25.840
Let's let's make this column and let's say it goes to the sum of all the values.

07:26.590 --> 07:30.490
Zero one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

07:31.330 --> 07:32.020
And we'll have.

07:32.810 --> 07:33.220
It.

07:35.230 --> 07:38.800
Nine and six five with 11 entries.

07:39.190 --> 07:43.600
14, 12, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14.

07:44.530 --> 07:51.430
I think we won't be needing ten in other values, but yeah, for your understanding, we are making

07:51.430 --> 07:52.930
this big table eight.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.910
Now tell me.

07:55.930 --> 07:57.200
So this is a boolean table, right?

07:57.250 --> 08:02.320
So it's a boolean, but it will be filling out the zeros and ones, but here we'll be needing one another

08:02.320 --> 08:04.930
table and that's kind of very important part.

08:05.390 --> 08:10.300
Another table that we need here will be unity and the table, which is the minimum wage table.

08:12.180 --> 08:16.710
So this is one solution that I'm proposing and I'm trying to explain it to you.

08:17.400 --> 08:22.290
And there will be another solution that will propose in the next video rate, and we'll see which of

08:22.290 --> 08:23.640
the solutions work actually.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.420
So just try to understand this and it's very interesting.

08:28.740 --> 08:32.340
So I'm giving you basically one, you now have three different types of solutions.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.860
One, that's a problem we have.

08:34.860 --> 08:36.750
You'll have another table called minimum rates.

08:38.920 --> 08:40.450
And what will this table do?

08:42.780 --> 08:46.680
So it will be like one on one mapping of the above table only basically.

08:47.190 --> 08:47.520
And.

09:09.940 --> 09:10.390
Great.

09:10.420 --> 09:11.630
So you do.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.690
One, two, three, four, five.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.160
Three eight.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.860
So here we have the second table and.

09:24.060 --> 09:28.650
But if I don't use fancy tables and proper linens, I just want you to understand this.

09:30.830 --> 09:33.330
But what I do is this is the minimum wage, stupid.

09:33.380 --> 09:35.000
What is minimum wage mean?

09:35.000 --> 09:41.030
Actually, minimum wage, in my terminology, means it for a particular index and for a particular value.

09:41.030 --> 09:42.050
What is the minimum?

09:44.630 --> 09:47.450
That is required to get the the minimum we need.

09:47.540 --> 09:52.370
So if let's say there are five kids of five different, different rates, then we'll have the minimum

09:52.370 --> 09:52.610
wage.

09:52.820 --> 09:56.300
And that said that, yes, I came to the Senate with this weird.

09:57.350 --> 09:57.980
It is the minimum.

09:58.490 --> 10:02.960
I might have come to the table with five different beats, but I'll take the minimum.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.000
You will.

10:04.460 --> 10:06.500
And now just go with me at eight.

10:07.970 --> 10:08.270
Yeah.

10:08.750 --> 10:09.530
Just be with me.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.600
So we're starting from zero.

10:12.020 --> 10:12.260
Okay.

10:12.980 --> 10:13.430
What index?

10:13.430 --> 10:13.850
Zero.

10:14.300 --> 10:15.960
I say that we don't have anything.

10:15.980 --> 10:16.760
It's empty.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.500
So what are the values that we can make?

10:19.670 --> 10:20.320
Zero values.

10:23.510 --> 10:27.170
Hey, that means I cannot make anybody there, so I'm filling zero on it.

10:27.850 --> 10:29.450
Hey, so that's a boolean.

10:29.690 --> 10:31.160
Zero means that value can be formed.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.710
One means that value can be formed just like this object and problem.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.540
Now, let's move on to the first.

10:37.820 --> 10:43.740
And they tell me, what are the values we have in the first index tree?

10:44.300 --> 10:44.610
Right.

10:45.170 --> 10:45.440
So.

10:46.720 --> 10:51.190
What we have is can military be formed at the first index?

10:51.940 --> 10:52.280
Yes.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.520
So can value zero be formed on the first index?

10:54.970 --> 10:56.140
No value one.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.830
No value to.

10:58.150 --> 10:58.450
No.

10:58.900 --> 10:59.110
But.

10:59.110 --> 10:59.470
Yes.

10:59.650 --> 11:04.870
Value zero zero can be formed from the first index, but from the other NICS by mistake.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.510
That is value zero zero.

11:07.780 --> 11:12.100
What is what does it mean that the zero two value can be formed if I have no items?

11:12.760 --> 11:14.110
Eight That should be true.

11:14.710 --> 11:14.950
Eight.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.740
And yes, let's build them remembered stable.

11:17.740 --> 11:21.370
Also, like simultaneously they will have zero.

11:22.670 --> 11:24.820
000000.

11:24.830 --> 11:28.580
So these are the minimum rates because we are not filling it with anything.

11:28.580 --> 11:30.560
So that's why it's all zeros right now.

11:31.250 --> 11:31.580
No.

11:32.550 --> 11:33.090
We are on.

11:33.480 --> 11:33.740
Let's see.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.140
We are on this particular part here.

11:37.140 --> 11:40.740
And we are now filling the front part, which is at one.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.180
But tell me.

11:44.530 --> 11:49.630
Of that if I try and add the first.

11:51.330 --> 11:53.010
Basically what we call it.

11:54.150 --> 12:01.260
If I train at the first rate with the first rate with three and a value three, it's the right number.

12:01.260 --> 12:02.430
You're just worrying about values.

12:02.970 --> 12:03.210
So.

12:04.540 --> 12:08.290
And then they have six values, zero, one and two.

12:08.500 --> 12:14.200
If I'm on the first index, if only the elements in first index are considered know they cannot have

12:14.530 --> 12:16.810
it's voted in 00008.

12:17.140 --> 12:20.290
So it's kind of the tabular DP that I'm trying to meet.

12:20.710 --> 12:21.700
So how does it work?

12:22.510 --> 12:25.420
There'd be b, IAG is the value, right?

12:25.840 --> 12:26.560
But BP.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.570
IAG will only be true if.

12:29.660 --> 12:31.400
EPI I minus one day through.

12:32.900 --> 12:33.200
Again.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.750
I'll give you a big explanation for this.

12:36.680 --> 12:37.280
Do not get.

12:42.530 --> 12:43.550
So this is deep.

12:43.580 --> 12:44.750
I hear.

12:45.700 --> 12:45.970
Eight.

12:47.040 --> 12:47.560
G7.

12:49.140 --> 12:49.770
NDP.

12:50.340 --> 12:50.640
Yeah.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.440
So how can DPA be filled?

12:52.680 --> 12:53.550
If I take.

12:55.280 --> 12:55.810
Yes, I do.

12:56.080 --> 12:56.590
That means.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.120
BP i.

13:01.160 --> 13:06.350
Minus one that means of the previous we must have field day minus its weight.

13:08.230 --> 13:10.490
Eight normal stuff goes there.

13:10.690 --> 13:14.830
In the previous row, we must have filled it with two minus.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.320
That means that particular.

13:18.510 --> 13:19.910
Still should have been filled.

13:20.910 --> 13:23.700
Or was the second part if I don't take it?

13:24.760 --> 13:27.580
If I don't take the right item.

13:28.710 --> 13:31.110
That means, and so should we be.

13:31.290 --> 13:32.060
I mean, this one.

13:33.510 --> 13:34.390
Because I'm not taking it.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.000
That means there is no change in which.

13:36.650 --> 13:41.640
So if I'm minus one Jew, that means that particular value was one.

13:41.670 --> 13:43.140
Then this value can also be formed.

13:43.890 --> 13:44.880
Oh, right.

13:45.090 --> 13:49.350
Now, there's one additional concern that is about the boots, right?

13:49.800 --> 13:49.950
The.

13:49.950 --> 13:51.450
How can I say that?

13:52.820 --> 13:53.690
This particular.

13:56.180 --> 14:03.260
It's not de minus W, h, de minus V, it's the values we are seeking.

14:03.740 --> 14:04.850
You know, human is the values.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.640
Hey, nobody's hugging to see that.

14:08.910 --> 14:10.500
This particular can be offered.

14:10.500 --> 14:18.240
So let's see the Jimenez VA Jimenez VA sell on the A-minus went through and it was filled with some

14:18.630 --> 14:21.560
fairly close to W only eight.

14:21.840 --> 14:28.650
No, I cannot take dietary advice because the weight the weight in that particular position a bit their

14:29.220 --> 14:36.290
weight that means on my enjoyment index and do my manageable weight in the minimum stable while w that

14:36.300 --> 14:36.540
means.

14:38.900 --> 14:45.850
Value that was being formed, which is Dominion's value that was being formed, was from a bit late,

14:46.130 --> 14:46.730
but now.

14:48.470 --> 14:55.130
But now I cannot evaluate item because item I will have some weight and I cannot like included in the

14:55.130 --> 14:57.160
knapsack with this current VW.

14:58.070 --> 14:59.210
Well, I have to have this.

14:59.390 --> 15:06.290
That's why I'm keeping the minimum stable as a separate table, right where I'll be just feeling what

15:06.290 --> 15:09.520
is the minimum wage in this particular value is being filled.

15:10.130 --> 15:13.010
So once I fill this, then you will easily understand this.

15:13.010 --> 15:14.420
Just be with me.

15:19.840 --> 15:20.080
Yeah.

15:20.580 --> 15:23.380
Now, let's move on to the first index.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.330
We can easily see that.

15:26.410 --> 15:27.970
We can fill.

15:29.010 --> 15:30.360
This value.

15:31.440 --> 15:36.230
We can feel this tree value if I take item number one five because BP.

15:38.080 --> 15:41.440
One minus one is zero and j minus we're just three.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.570
Minus three is it goes to one.

15:44.050 --> 15:49.480
That means if this particular location was filled and the weight was zero, right.

15:49.480 --> 15:54.100
So if it was zero and I add zero plus it's gotten root three.

15:54.280 --> 15:58.510
So zero plus three is less than the total weight eight zero plus.

15:58.510 --> 16:00.220
There is less in the total weight which is.

16:03.610 --> 16:03.790
Yeah.

16:03.820 --> 16:04.840
What was the total weight?

16:05.140 --> 16:05.620
Yeah, it.

16:09.990 --> 16:10.260
So.

16:11.310 --> 16:12.300
Yeah, so it is eight.

16:13.590 --> 16:14.490
So what we have is.

16:17.430 --> 16:18.450
This can be filled.

16:19.440 --> 16:19.740
Eight.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.350
Similarly, a four cannot be fooled.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.400
Five cannot be fooled.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.300
Six cannot be fooled.

16:24.930 --> 16:26.160
Seven Going to revered Canada.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.230
But yes, zero can be found.

16:28.910 --> 16:30.600
Eight V0 can be free.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.280
We all know because.

16:33.830 --> 16:35.150
We are not taking the first element.

16:35.150 --> 16:37.250
That means if well, if there was.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.500
Something with values zero.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.790
That means there will be something with value zero again, because I'm not taking the current element

16:45.420 --> 16:46.740
much like the subsequent problem.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.900
Now let's talk about the second.

16:51.230 --> 16:51.560
I do.

16:51.980 --> 16:52.870
The second item.

16:53.210 --> 16:55.310
Okay, so I just forgot this.

16:55.550 --> 16:56.620
We also have to feel the way.

16:56.620 --> 16:57.740
It's right here.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.960
The way it will be 0080.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.550
But now goes the way it will be.

17:01.550 --> 17:07.700
Three five will do will be three because this is the minimum rate from which I am able to.

17:08.540 --> 17:09.830
Why did I make it one?

17:10.010 --> 17:16.360
Because, yes, there was a particular combination such that value three can be formed eight.

17:16.550 --> 17:19.160
So this is the minimum weight, which is three.

17:20.320 --> 17:23.800
Says that this particular combination can reform rate similarly zero for all.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.260
It now.

17:28.260 --> 17:28.530
Yeah.

17:28.890 --> 17:31.640
Now, let's talk about that second element, which is foreign flight.

17:31.890 --> 17:35.280
I want to find out whether zero value can be filled or not.

17:35.310 --> 17:36.330
Yes, it can be filled.

17:36.570 --> 17:39.930
If I'm not taking the second element, the zero value will be filled with a weird zero.

17:40.770 --> 17:45.360
And then the value one before you know why?

17:45.360 --> 17:45.810
Because.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.540
We cannot fill it because both of these is in vogue.

17:50.540 --> 17:56.000
Both of these because of relations don't want to be I mean is one Jay's also not true and baby Iman

17:56.000 --> 17:58.430
is Benjamin as we age out of index eight.

17:58.730 --> 18:00.170
But this also doesn't work.

18:00.890 --> 18:01.850
This also doesn't work.

18:01.850 --> 18:04.190
But this will work with the minimum rate of.

18:05.360 --> 18:05.990
Right now.

18:06.190 --> 18:13.550
So I just constantly keep on updating because after that what I have is let's move on to forward.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.740
So this won't work, but five will work.

18:18.770 --> 18:19.030
Why?

18:19.040 --> 18:20.270
Because this is true.

18:20.360 --> 18:20.720
Which is?

18:20.760 --> 18:21.150
Dubai.

18:21.170 --> 18:22.220
Minus one, five.

18:22.220 --> 18:22.760
Minus five.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.450
If that's true, I can make this five happen.

18:26.450 --> 18:26.750
Right?

18:26.990 --> 18:28.580
That means it will be one of you.

18:28.970 --> 18:31.220
So what is the minimum wage for five days?

18:31.520 --> 18:33.680
It will be for eight.

18:34.070 --> 18:39.560
Well, I hope you're getting this minimum feeling rich, because here we are, 100 plus.

18:39.560 --> 18:43.620
The current rate, which is four, is less than maximum.

18:43.640 --> 18:47.570
We pay two for all the values, for all the indexes and for all the values.

18:47.570 --> 18:49.040
I'm actually having the minimum rate.

18:49.490 --> 18:54.650
This is the minimum rate in which this particular value is being formed.

18:54.980 --> 18:57.590
If they are multiple, it will take the minimum rate.

18:58.870 --> 19:02.080
So yeah for over here and let's move forward.

19:02.680 --> 19:08.710
0601 reform because six is not great and six minus five is not set, which is one.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.140
Not formed not.

19:11.680 --> 19:15.610
And yes, this will be formed goes by because eight minus five is three.

19:16.050 --> 19:16.420
So if.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.470
One commentary is true.

19:19.550 --> 19:20.540
That means to Obama.

19:20.540 --> 19:21.430
It will also be true.

19:21.440 --> 19:21.680
Why?

19:21.680 --> 19:25.310
Because all you mean is one day minus value.

19:26.030 --> 19:29.930
This particular value can be formed eight and.

19:31.350 --> 19:31.620
Yeah.

19:31.650 --> 19:33.360
So I adopted it with the minimum wage.

19:34.050 --> 19:35.250
What is the minimum wage here?

19:35.280 --> 19:37.440
So we have the weird three over here.

19:37.800 --> 19:43.290
A three plus 523 plus for the second rate is seven.

19:43.620 --> 19:46.710
This is the minimum that I was talking about.

19:47.460 --> 19:47.910
Now.

19:49.550 --> 19:53.600
Nine zero ten 090 ten zero one.

19:53.600 --> 19:58.160
Let's read the last column, and in last year it will be one with a weird zero.

19:58.640 --> 20:03.380
So but the rate is five and the values six eight.

20:03.740 --> 20:06.860
So right now we just have to copy from the above only.

20:06.860 --> 20:08.660
So zero, one, zero.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.870
And so value six and eight.

20:11.870 --> 20:13.520
So then five, let's just copy it.

20:14.070 --> 20:16.130
So here will be 0030.

20:16.670 --> 20:19.670
Then the minimum wage till now is three if this value is being filled.

20:21.780 --> 20:22.290
And.

20:26.900 --> 20:28.170
Well, now let's move to this.

20:28.170 --> 20:29.350
Six, eight.

20:29.370 --> 20:31.410
Let's come to the six we know.

20:31.440 --> 20:36.690
If I want to fill this particular cell with just to become a six, then I would be needing to go almost

20:36.690 --> 20:40.700
six in and two comma denotes it to zero.

20:40.710 --> 20:43.140
STRUS That means this will also be true.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.780
Eight That means this sum can be found.

20:45.810 --> 20:50.790
If I only consider the third element over the minimum video, it will be zero plus.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.180
I would just fight.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.500
Well, okay.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.430
So it's not in this.

20:58.430 --> 20:59.810
I guess this is it.

21:00.710 --> 21:02.780
Yeah, this will be fun and this will be fine, but.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.570
Let's move on to the next cell, which is seven cell.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.830
Here we have.

21:09.330 --> 21:10.530
The value to be six.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.470
So it will be seven minus six is one.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.030
So of course that's not true and even this is not true.

21:15.030 --> 21:16.710
So seven cannot be formed.

21:17.030 --> 21:18.510
It'll fill the void with zeros.

21:19.870 --> 21:20.800
And so guess what?

21:21.160 --> 21:22.750
Here I am, filling the world with the robot.

21:23.070 --> 21:24.280
Initially, what will happen is.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.130
We want to show the minimum wage rate.

21:30.660 --> 21:32.820
So we don't have to fill it with zero.

21:32.850 --> 21:34.470
Will fill it with something very big.

21:35.100 --> 21:35.370
Well.

21:38.150 --> 21:39.740
Now let's move on to the next step.

21:39.750 --> 21:40.520
Which is it?

21:40.840 --> 21:45.280
So if I want to feel that it's in the sequence of the should be true, which is not true.

21:45.290 --> 21:49.310
8 to 0 again, zero again not zero.

21:49.310 --> 21:49.700
Sorry.

21:50.330 --> 21:50.960
VINER Zero.

21:50.960 --> 21:57.830
Because there's a second thing that I if I don't want to take the third item, I won't take it.

21:58.040 --> 22:01.640
So where that answer will be kept, if I don't take it, it will be A-minus funded.

22:02.030 --> 22:07.460
That means no increase in value or simply, yes, this value can be formed and this is the minimum bid

22:08.210 --> 22:12.620
rate and the next is 939.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.300
If nine minus six, it is me.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.090
So here we can see three d has a rate of three.

22:17.810 --> 22:20.000
But three plus it's weird.

22:20.000 --> 22:20.840
Which is five.

22:20.900 --> 22:25.220
So three plus five is less than equal to it.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.330
If three plus five is less and equal to eight.

22:29.310 --> 22:30.200
What does this mean?

22:30.210 --> 22:37.740
This, yes, I can take this particular item into my knapsack because I clearly we had only one of three

22:38.130 --> 22:38.490
in here.

22:38.490 --> 22:39.420
We have it of three.

22:39.780 --> 22:41.220
I mean you only it is three, right.

22:41.670 --> 22:46.650
If this value is being fulfilled with this index, I mean, I'm really sorry, but now.

22:47.850 --> 22:49.680
I can add five after.

22:50.780 --> 22:53.300
Eight five because I'm including the content element.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.900
If I include five of the three, what I'll get is I'll get one.

22:57.350 --> 23:00.170
It yes, it can be found with a minimum rate of five plus three.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.370
Is it.

23:02.540 --> 23:08.480
Actually, I'm trying to constantly keep the minimum wage stuff.

23:08.690 --> 23:08.970
Eight.

23:08.990 --> 23:13.400
So some of you might be thinking that these words are like unique.

23:13.430 --> 23:15.290
Why am I saying minimum binary?

23:15.300 --> 23:21.050
It's minimum because, guys, this is a pretty good example in which we don't have winter coming to

23:21.050 --> 23:22.400
any state with two different.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.120
But we are not going to win the state with two different parts.

23:26.780 --> 23:27.080
So.

23:28.060 --> 23:31.840
In this example, we we did not come across that particular.

23:33.530 --> 23:39.290
Is where we have to take the minimum wage in all of your ten unique and we're taking them rate but let's

23:39.290 --> 23:45.830
say at this position I came from this step here also and here also I mean from two different transitions

23:45.830 --> 23:51.530
they coming to a one particular cell, one particular strain of TB, then I have to take the minimum

23:52.070 --> 23:58.610
of the bodyweight eight so here it would be one and it will be eight and similarly zero and zero eight.

23:58.820 --> 24:03.890
So after all of this, is what I take, is it for all the elements that do it in next three?

24:04.700 --> 24:07.130
What is the maximum value that can be?

24:08.090 --> 24:09.860
What is the maximum value that can be filled?

24:10.220 --> 24:11.600
It is nine.

24:12.970 --> 24:17.500
The maximum value, which is fewer, which has a weight less than equal to it is.

24:19.340 --> 24:19.640
Eight.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.530
The nine will be my final answer.

24:22.890 --> 24:27.690
Initially, I remove zeros from the values, so if I had zero, it will become 90.

24:29.330 --> 24:30.070
We are getting this.

24:30.070 --> 24:31.990
It's very similar to the substation problem.

24:31.990 --> 24:36.040
So instead of having IEEE and Bates As.

24:37.640 --> 24:41.330
Instead of having I invades as the able.

24:42.630 --> 24:46.350
Arguments, stable rows and columns, 30 p values.

24:46.710 --> 24:49.500
I'm having i.e. the design index and the values.

24:49.860 --> 24:51.780
So it's like constant specific.

24:52.260 --> 24:54.480
But I just like.

24:55.830 --> 25:01.260
If you are still not getting this, then I think you should move on to the knapsack problem which is

25:01.260 --> 25:04.800
being expanded, the NBA and you should see that part of the right.

25:04.830 --> 25:10.140
So he's building that table using the knapsack because I haven't explained that in the previous video.

25:10.140 --> 25:14.970
I was extremely recursive approach because I was expecting that you have already gone through this knapsack

25:15.480 --> 25:15.720
thing.

25:15.720 --> 25:16.020
Right.

25:16.830 --> 25:18.390
And also see this obstruction problem.

25:18.720 --> 25:24.030
So in their tabular and normal knapsack approach, what we do is we will wait over it.

25:25.740 --> 25:25.930
Right.

25:26.100 --> 25:29.810
We feel valued over here and we have build, says the argument.

25:30.720 --> 25:34.050
I'm talking about the normal knapsack problem in which we fill a table.

25:34.560 --> 25:35.670
Here we have indexes.

25:36.090 --> 25:37.860
Here we have weights.

25:38.780 --> 25:41.390
And here inside, we have values eight.

25:43.110 --> 25:48.660
But in this, what I'm doing is I'm having index Hoosier values here and virtue.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.490
And these people said, actually, minimum wage.

25:51.180 --> 25:54.750
And finally, what I'm figuring out and what is the last column which is filled?

25:56.290 --> 26:01.240
The last column which is filled will be the values column and that particular value has been made.

26:01.780 --> 26:02.050
Eight.

26:03.030 --> 26:07.800
So it's been a big explanation and a really tricky one.

26:08.610 --> 26:09.660
Let's call it out base.

26:11.700 --> 26:12.990
Including for the first time.

26:13.170 --> 26:14.220
This particular part?

26:14.970 --> 26:15.290
Yes.

26:15.300 --> 26:15.800
Let's see.

26:17.300 --> 26:17.510
Yeah.

26:17.510 --> 26:21.530
So we what we have is we have all this stuff, actually.

26:22.340 --> 26:23.060
And isn't it.

26:23.510 --> 26:23.780
Yes.

26:23.790 --> 26:24.380
And isn't it.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.630
And is under VW.

26:26.900 --> 26:27.230
Okay.

26:27.230 --> 26:27.620
Okay.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.150
So we don't need this memo part.

26:30.270 --> 26:31.020
Before this.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.160
Let me see if this.

26:35.420 --> 26:35.850
Nap.

26:40.740 --> 26:41.580
Open new.

26:43.390 --> 26:44.430
This will be Napster, too.

26:44.440 --> 26:48.190
So let's remove the memo part and remove this.

26:49.700 --> 26:49.910
Right.

26:50.780 --> 26:54.440
What we have is values which w in n will.

26:55.900 --> 26:56.200
Cool.

26:56.200 --> 26:56.800
Cool, cool.

26:56.950 --> 26:57.310
Okay.

26:59.190 --> 27:00.450
What else do we need, guys?

27:00.480 --> 27:05.100
We also need some one another, which is minimum wage, stable minimum wage.

27:05.820 --> 27:07.730
They try to fill it with something else.

27:08.580 --> 27:08.840
Eight.

27:09.980 --> 27:12.470
So yeah.

27:12.470 --> 27:17.180
So this minimum wage statement should be and cross sum of total values.

27:17.780 --> 27:22.310
So the sum of total values is the maximum a loser going to in the worst case, what is the maximum value

27:22.310 --> 27:24.710
we're going to have, which is energy poverty?

27:25.610 --> 27:26.030
And.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.320
And then to the poverty.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.130
In two.

27:35.550 --> 27:36.500
Andrew Right.

27:36.510 --> 27:37.740
So distant is about five.

27:38.580 --> 27:42.300
So yeah, it will be 100001.

27:43.380 --> 27:44.580
This is the minimum wage stable.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.260
And similarly, let's make a debatable.

27:47.820 --> 27:50.910
100018.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.010
And literally one by one.

27:53.530 --> 27:55.170
So for the first.

27:55.770 --> 27:56.040
Yeah.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.840
So let's move on by one.

28:01.170 --> 28:09.120
So I will go from zero to equal to end eight by because I've considered zero to be an empty set.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.070
So everything should be one base indexing.

28:11.910 --> 28:13.260
Everything is one base indexing.

28:13.260 --> 28:14.400
I read one over here.

28:15.860 --> 28:16.220
Right.

28:17.480 --> 28:22.390
And so from one to in, I'm just simply taking it as an input.

28:25.050 --> 28:25.830
Here we have.

28:26.930 --> 28:28.400
Zero two NBA went from zero to win.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.660
So what do I need to feel, guys?

28:30.680 --> 28:37.640
In the zero eight rule of this tables but only this value should be 800 should be one.

28:37.640 --> 28:41.470
This is a base case that I don't have anything but yes, the value of zero can be fought.

28:43.060 --> 28:45.700
What is the minimum rate of zero zero?

28:45.730 --> 28:46.120
It is.

28:47.390 --> 28:48.380
Zero eight.

28:48.590 --> 28:52.520
Because I'm not doing anything that that means the rate is zero.

28:53.070 --> 28:57.800
So what I'll do is I'll simply, ma'am, set the minimum table before this.

28:58.460 --> 28:59.360
A very big value.

28:59.360 --> 28:59.690
Right.

29:00.230 --> 29:00.680
And.

29:02.650 --> 29:03.730
I think zero extra.

29:03.730 --> 29:06.280
If we take zero extra, you need to let me check.

29:07.130 --> 29:07.790
Mama said.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.290
Minimum wage stable.

29:11.300 --> 29:14.810
20x3 every passing from address.

29:16.580 --> 29:17.150
He's off.

29:18.560 --> 29:19.100
Minimum.

29:19.990 --> 29:23.230
Which is to say, is this forward?

29:27.400 --> 29:28.420
Is this?

29:32.120 --> 29:33.560
It will bottle w.

29:37.350 --> 29:43.560
So it's being filled with very big values because I'm giving it to an actress who does this monitoring

29:43.650 --> 29:45.390
to fill it with very big values.

29:45.960 --> 29:46.890
This is a big value.

29:47.550 --> 29:49.440
Great incentive of all you can do is you can.

29:52.660 --> 29:53.710
How does it work?

29:53.770 --> 29:54.960
It takes murder.

29:55.010 --> 29:58.140
So you're setting the memory and not the variable eight.

29:58.180 --> 29:59.560
So do not get confused.

29:59.980 --> 30:04.120
If you want to set the variable, you want to set the object, then you take vector.

30:04.420 --> 30:05.200
This is it.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.630
With that particular value, you want to fill it.

30:07.810 --> 30:08.830
Otherwise it won't work.

30:10.310 --> 30:14.350
So it's setting the memory in memory and passing a big address of this particular.

30:15.510 --> 30:16.530
Number eight.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.960
So it's a decimal eight.

30:19.820 --> 30:20.180
And.

30:21.170 --> 30:22.250
Well, let's move ahead.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.330
This will be values eight to.

30:27.930 --> 30:29.040
It's called values.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.860
And these values will go to.

30:31.470 --> 30:34.410
Oh, let's let's make it go till all these.

30:35.790 --> 30:36.780
Some of all the videos.

30:37.950 --> 30:39.060
It should be less than this.

30:39.890 --> 30:42.570
Well, so this is deep zero zero.

30:42.660 --> 30:44.490
This is minimum wage zero zero.

30:45.150 --> 30:50.100
And we feel all that the minimum wage with something very, very big.

30:50.980 --> 30:57.070
And if you want to feel the minimum wage bill, not with not something this big and you're not able

30:57.070 --> 31:00.110
to say, do this, apply for hate.

31:00.550 --> 31:06.970
Because minimum wage table it will it is also of this particular length eight.

31:07.330 --> 31:12.370
So what you gonna do is you can just apply a loop and fill these values like this.

31:13.930 --> 31:22.300
Based zero two in and minimum value I value is equal to let's call it intermix.

31:23.710 --> 31:24.720
Willing to make it work.

31:25.340 --> 31:25.930
It's sick.

31:27.210 --> 31:27.900
We need a winner.

31:27.930 --> 31:28.170
Okay.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.720
Then we fill it with something bigger.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.560
Fill it with money.

31:35.250 --> 31:37.020
Pretty well anything.

31:38.510 --> 31:45.460
So we go from zero to in values, go from 0 to 4 under the power five rule.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.270
So we are actually trading with all the table.

31:47.750 --> 31:52.250
If in the best case we are normal, we won't be going in the first row anymore.

31:52.610 --> 31:53.080
Empty row.

31:53.690 --> 31:58.880
I will start with the second row, which is over the next one eight here.

31:59.110 --> 32:05.360
What do I need to do is firstly I have to check this and if you p i minus one.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.170
And value.

32:08.350 --> 32:09.790
That means if I'm not taking them.

32:12.430 --> 32:12.860
It can.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.710
H if I'm not taking it that deep.

32:15.710 --> 32:18.740
I mean, one value should be said that it should be equal to one.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.270
I've taken it as an integer.

32:20.270 --> 32:20.600
Right.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.420
If this is sick, then it's very good.

32:24.170 --> 32:26.210
Let's see what this case.

32:26.210 --> 32:30.680
What we'll do is we'll simply say the p value is equal to one.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.420
That means, yes, this value can be formed.

32:32.660 --> 32:35.770
Secondly, let's upgrade the minimum bid minimum rate of I.

32:36.910 --> 32:40.120
Value is equal to a minimum of whatever the minimum was going on.

32:44.410 --> 32:47.140
The above, which is minimum weight of.

32:48.670 --> 32:49.390
Minus one and.

32:51.100 --> 32:53.400
So I'm constantly updating the minimum wage.

32:53.540 --> 32:57.380
So this is about when I'm not taking the agitator.

32:58.390 --> 32:59.640
So the answer is Camp David.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.100
That's true.

33:00.250 --> 33:00.550
Great.

33:00.550 --> 33:01.330
I'm not taking it.

33:01.510 --> 33:02.410
And just.

33:03.980 --> 33:04.780
Give me the minimum wage.

33:04.820 --> 33:06.500
Upgrade the minimum wage I can live.

33:06.500 --> 33:07.130
I'm taking it.

33:07.910 --> 33:08.960
When can I take it?

33:10.860 --> 33:15.870
When can I take this particular value if, uh, let's say a value minus V.

33:18.180 --> 33:18.400
Okay.

33:18.420 --> 33:20.230
So I'm going with all the military media.

33:20.280 --> 33:24.690
So if voluminous VA if there should be a greater than or equal to zero, first of all, then only I

33:24.690 --> 33:31.380
can check for this value rate if luminance b is greater than or equal to zero and participation condition

33:31.710 --> 33:32.580
if minimum.

33:33.060 --> 33:38.310
And yes, this should also be true EBIT and value minus four should be true.

33:39.570 --> 33:39.830
Right.

33:40.350 --> 33:42.840
Because if that is, that cell is being filled.

33:42.870 --> 33:46.950
If there was a way of making their tail, then there should be a way of making this.

33:46.950 --> 33:48.810
And what that third and final condition.

33:49.400 --> 33:53.490
At minimum wage of the current cell that is I and.

33:54.760 --> 34:02.520
But this should be a minus one and the minimum rate of i.e. minus one and value minus via.

34:03.420 --> 34:04.740
But many members of this cell.

34:09.140 --> 34:09.410
Yeah.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.570
So let me make another next thing.

34:15.300 --> 34:21.960
If I'm if I'm acting and if I'm taking an element, if I'm taking an item, it means I'm adding the

34:21.960 --> 34:29.880
weights, the minimum weight of I minus one voluminous value that that particular sin, if that plus

34:29.880 --> 34:35.700
cut into it, is less than equal to W, then only I can pick this particular item.

34:35.700 --> 34:36.660
So we have to recondition.

34:36.660 --> 34:39.420
The first is its value should be this.

34:39.420 --> 34:43.890
It's the value that I'm trying to fill should be greater than the value of the item.

34:43.890 --> 34:44.520
Secondly.

34:46.320 --> 34:50.100
It's if I'm applying this item after a particular.

34:51.880 --> 34:55.660
Another item, another values, that that should be true, that only this can be true.

34:55.900 --> 34:58.540
The third is minimum eight.

34:59.110 --> 35:00.070
So let me updated.

35:00.760 --> 35:09.860
What I do here is I simply say the i.e. value is equal to one because that's true and the P and minimum,

35:10.220 --> 35:11.290
it's up to the minimum wage.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.140
So minimum wage, i.e. value is equal to minimum of.

35:17.380 --> 35:18.240
Minimum wage.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.850
I value Obama, whatever the minimum.

35:21.850 --> 35:22.470
What's going on?

35:22.480 --> 35:22.900
Karma.

35:24.610 --> 35:25.240
What are we going to eat?

35:25.510 --> 35:25.840
Yeah.

35:25.870 --> 35:26.350
This food.

35:27.130 --> 35:27.910
This w.

35:30.600 --> 35:30.850
Well.

35:31.620 --> 35:33.930
So if I'm feeling it with this particular weight.

35:34.990 --> 35:37.710
This plus w then it will automatically be made.

35:38.190 --> 35:40.660
The trip checked into the date doesn't go out of bounds.

35:40.670 --> 35:41.680
Also eight.

35:42.070 --> 35:43.450
And what's the final?

35:45.150 --> 35:45.440
Thing.

35:45.990 --> 35:50.220
So what did we decide that the last value column which is being filled.

35:50.870 --> 35:54.030
But it's it's kind of there's a larger subset sum basically.

35:54.300 --> 35:59.970
It's a subset some problem with a specific concern that the knapsack has a weight.

36:00.210 --> 36:05.280
But, Richard, not actually so far that we're we're trying to store minimum boots everywhere and trying

36:05.280 --> 36:08.010
to make transitions the water finally.

36:09.630 --> 36:11.010
Oh, yeah.

36:11.160 --> 36:11.420
So what?

36:11.610 --> 36:12.800
What would be the final answer?

36:12.810 --> 36:15.950
It should be the last value we just fill.

36:16.560 --> 36:16.810
Right.

36:17.230 --> 36:18.600
Let's go this way.

36:18.600 --> 36:19.340
Only let's start.

36:19.350 --> 36:22.560
I believe only when you are evil you will go.

36:22.560 --> 36:25.650
They'll find 0001.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.410
I shouldn't be going to go on standard instead.

36:28.990 --> 36:33.840
So if what we call it, BP lasted and minus one day.

36:33.840 --> 36:41.460
So and in this case because I'm digging when base indexing if DB end value that means answer is.

36:44.190 --> 36:49.350
Well, whatever it is, the last one it will answer will automatically take it as the last one.

36:50.300 --> 36:51.830
It's ballistic for errors.

36:53.270 --> 36:59.000
Right so here we C-17s the answer rate so I hope the 17 is a it's answered eight.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.560
Its take for this.

37:04.250 --> 37:06.650
And then let's build.

37:07.560 --> 37:09.060
For this.

37:10.860 --> 37:11.280
So here.

37:11.280 --> 37:11.540
Yeah.

37:11.550 --> 37:12.690
So here we have a problem.

37:12.690 --> 37:13.710
They too, let's say.

37:13.740 --> 37:14.970
What's the problem we're facing?

37:15.390 --> 37:17.040
They begin to be great.

37:17.280 --> 37:21.120
But in this the answer should be ten alternative.

37:21.190 --> 37:23.160
And over this the answer is standard eight.

37:23.910 --> 37:26.490
But in our code it is giving us.

37:33.040 --> 37:33.420
Yeah.

37:33.430 --> 37:34.540
So it should not be five.

37:34.540 --> 37:34.780
Five.

37:34.780 --> 37:35.290
It should be.

37:36.850 --> 37:38.050
It is isn't great.

37:42.090 --> 37:44.490
So the second statement is slightly changed.

37:45.390 --> 37:47.100
And now let me say I'm retired.

37:52.990 --> 37:53.620
Okay.

37:53.950 --> 37:54.550
Let's see.

37:54.550 --> 37:55.420
It works and not.

37:56.610 --> 37:58.920
The delineates discuss the complexity of this.

37:58.920 --> 38:03.450
So initially what I have is I've taken the input not a big deal then I have.

38:05.220 --> 38:05.680
Used.

38:07.170 --> 38:07.350
Yeah.

38:07.350 --> 38:08.460
I mean, it's like there it is.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.980
And in the end it's about five, which is going to be over seven.

38:11.760 --> 38:15.780
Similarly, I'm doing the same thing in this volume, which is and we're going to do the book five.

38:15.780 --> 38:17.070
We're just going to do our seven.

38:18.010 --> 38:18.430
Or.

38:19.150 --> 38:19.280
Yeah.

38:19.500 --> 38:20.860
Is listening to seven eight.

38:21.490 --> 38:21.730
Yeah.

38:21.730 --> 38:24.790
So here we can see we've got the accepted solution.

38:25.240 --> 38:28.360
So this is the first time trying it and see the time is also really less.

38:30.210 --> 38:36.570
What's happening here is let me attributed repudiate the value the concept of the the value going state

38:36.570 --> 38:38.520
is very small with this of over three eight.

38:38.940 --> 38:45.960
But the total value that can be formed is in about three in 200 because we have those many items pertaining

38:45.960 --> 38:46.350
to the boat.

38:46.350 --> 38:50.090
Five is the total value that can be formed due to their term.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.320
Taking columns to return to the five year.

38:53.760 --> 38:58.110
Well, now, what we're trying to do is for every index and for every value, we are trying to fill

38:58.110 --> 39:03.960
it by using a similar recursive religion that if I take that element, that means this particular value

39:03.960 --> 39:04.560
should be filled.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.300
Second condition was.

39:07.670 --> 39:13.220
The minimum wage at this index that is minus one G, minus V.

39:14.250 --> 39:18.660
The minimum wage plus the current weight of the current aluminium taking.

39:18.660 --> 39:25.920
It should be less any W and the third very the third was just a constraint check that it doesn't go

39:25.920 --> 39:27.640
out of bounds full.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.490
If I don't take it, then it's very simple.

39:30.490 --> 39:31.200
It is human is one.

39:31.210 --> 39:33.340
And and they believe me.

39:33.610 --> 39:37.870
You will find only these two these two relations you will find in this absurd.

39:37.870 --> 39:38.440
Same problem.

39:38.680 --> 39:39.100
Same.

39:40.730 --> 39:42.500
Problem and you will find.

39:43.640 --> 39:45.850
The same thing in the knapsack.

39:45.860 --> 39:46.970
Not my problem also.

39:48.220 --> 39:48.480
Eight.

39:48.790 --> 39:51.070
Where we are just feeling a the bit.

39:52.260 --> 39:54.010
In that we are feeling the values normal.

39:54.250 --> 39:56.620
But here we are feeling the weights, the minimum wage.

39:57.220 --> 40:03.310
The minimum wage part is very important because it is only allowing us to because let's see if I if

40:03.310 --> 40:09.790
I was able to fill something index to with a value five it's a there were two ways of feeling this one

40:09.790 --> 40:14.930
with a weight of ten and one with a weight of five only then of course, minimum wage would be five

40:14.930 --> 40:15.220
rate.

40:15.580 --> 40:22.390
Because if I feel this five, then it is like good for future uses of of future differences.

40:22.390 --> 40:25.570
This minimum wage should be five because I have to feel the next.

40:26.500 --> 40:26.650
Okay.

40:26.680 --> 40:29.470
Well, then I prefer the next table and I prefer the next table and so on.

40:30.500 --> 40:30.760
Right.

40:32.620 --> 40:35.890
So the storage and the space and complexity of it is there into the power.

40:37.230 --> 40:37.570
Seven.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.140
BULL Oh, thank you, race.

40:41.340 --> 40:43.230
And see you in the next.

40:45.250 --> 40:46.990
And there were seven in the next video.

40:52.840 --> 40:53.100
Mr..
