00:00.490 --> 00:01.930
It's called the problem.

00:02.380 --> 00:05.550
And in Italy, what we have, we have the number of test cases.

00:06.510 --> 00:08.190
Fine food and money.

00:09.820 --> 00:11.650
Fine food and money paid.

00:12.520 --> 00:16.690
So, yeah, let's take the number of excuses.

00:19.530 --> 00:21.300
Why do you minus my nurse?

00:21.800 --> 00:24.150
If of course we are making a recursive function.

00:24.150 --> 00:27.920
So let's stick and be as global variable.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.540
Let's take them as global variables because we'll be needing them.

00:34.630 --> 00:39.880
Of course you can also pass them, but it's good taking global values if you can.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.120
If you solve the same problem, it could mean you'd go.

00:43.150 --> 00:45.490
What happens is generally they will not.

00:45.730 --> 00:49.300
They will just give you a function to go in with the passing, the board, the strings.

00:49.540 --> 00:52.270
And that gives you have to pass this things by reference.

00:52.660 --> 00:56.560
Don't pass this thing as a copy because it will take a lot of time.

00:57.370 --> 01:00.290
If it copies it a lot of time, you can pass it better print.

01:00.760 --> 01:01.480
What we can do is.

01:03.380 --> 01:05.180
Again can solve this problem.

01:05.180 --> 01:08.570
Only two days later in the next video we can solve this problem.

01:08.750 --> 01:10.340
It could also by.

01:11.730 --> 01:13.990
But this is a problem approach.

01:14.010 --> 01:20.460
We can already using a bottom up approach will integrate both of them will work it out and.

01:21.980 --> 01:22.910
We'll cover both of them.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.930
So let's say interoperability, trade and it.

01:28.180 --> 01:32.650
Is an air intake on my in Taji.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.060
Those are states.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.090
He'll be out.

01:37.940 --> 01:39.200
At a distance.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.320
Initially starting from zero zero.

01:46.310 --> 01:46.820
But what are they?

01:47.000 --> 01:50.810
Whatever the case is, if I go straight or size, then simply.

01:51.710 --> 01:58.520
The first case was if both are pointing to empty string in this case, both are pointing to the empty

01:58.520 --> 01:58.850
strings.

01:59.300 --> 02:05.090
That means assembly be zero because it's the final base case equals to be space.

02:08.440 --> 02:17.530
If I equals to Edwards size, then I will simply return whatever B's sizes minus.

02:21.070 --> 02:30.280
And similarly, if there was to be large size, then I'll simply trim whatever it or sizes minus.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.670
I hope these are very clear, the base cases.

02:34.300 --> 02:39.940
Now, if we are moving ahead from these space based cases, it simply means that it is less than a takes.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.750
And there is less than three doses.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.350
That means I can.

02:46.800 --> 02:52.140
Meaning this if casework rate, which is if EIA is not equal to beat, that means because there are

02:52.140 --> 02:52.860
both the characters.

02:52.860 --> 02:54.480
We can always have this check.

02:55.800 --> 03:00.840
If it is not equal to BD, then it's the answer is true.

03:01.880 --> 03:02.450
And.

03:02.960 --> 03:03.140
Okay.

03:03.260 --> 03:04.370
I would take the minimum rate.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.440
Let's let's say do some answer and answer.

03:09.460 --> 03:12.790
Is a minimum of the district that we have done.

03:12.790 --> 03:13.060
I.

03:13.190 --> 03:13.420
I.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.070
Plus one committee.

03:16.790 --> 03:17.090
Okay.

03:17.150 --> 03:21.920
So here you can see that we have plus one in front of all the states.

03:22.910 --> 03:24.230
Eight plus one plus one plus one.

03:24.230 --> 03:32.090
So I'm taking this plus one outside, which I'm good at just seven plus minimum of D be this my DP I

03:32.090 --> 03:37.090
got my G plus one gamma e i pleasant comedy plus one.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.850
Eight because we are performing some operations here.

03:42.270 --> 03:43.200
They're taking that out.

03:43.620 --> 03:48.300
This minimum will not work, so I'll just have to raise it for November.

03:48.930 --> 03:52.020
And finally, the other one is on Saturday.

03:52.020 --> 03:57.240
It goes to the EPA plus one comment because both the characters are saying they don't need any operations

03:57.240 --> 03:57.750
to match.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.090
Eight.

03:59.470 --> 04:00.250
It's built this.

04:04.120 --> 04:04.540
Spirited.

04:06.790 --> 04:08.230
It appeared to be.

04:08.620 --> 04:09.280
But it's not.

04:10.240 --> 04:10.570
Embedded.

04:11.380 --> 04:12.790
I have this habit of people.

04:17.670 --> 04:19.380
So we have got 40 people.

04:19.410 --> 04:22.920
So at a distance of these things is for others only one thing that is left.

04:22.950 --> 04:23.930
It is memorization.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.050
How many states are there?

04:25.620 --> 04:26.250
I NJ.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.970
I was still in Vegas in memory.

04:29.340 --> 04:31.650
Let me quickly check what the length of the string.

04:32.190 --> 04:34.020
The end of the string won't exceed 2000.

04:34.620 --> 04:35.070
Very good.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.150
It's a memorization.

04:37.750 --> 04:38.470
2000.

04:38.470 --> 04:39.220
2000.

04:40.660 --> 04:41.260
Very simple.

04:41.260 --> 04:42.410
Eight oh.

04:44.010 --> 04:44.600
After the base.

04:44.790 --> 04:50.250
His legacy memo I read in article two minus one.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.180
Written memo.

04:53.550 --> 04:53.960
I.

04:55.490 --> 04:56.000
And.

04:57.950 --> 04:58.190
It.

05:01.230 --> 05:03.900
And before calling it Memo said Memo.

05:07.830 --> 05:09.450
Will it be built again?

05:11.640 --> 05:13.590
Well, I think it's a working solution.

05:13.590 --> 05:15.240
And you can see it was so easy.

05:15.690 --> 05:20.940
It just that you need to worry about how are these states coming Wednesday plus one, Wednesday plus

05:20.940 --> 05:23.510
one, when is both of them late.

05:23.520 --> 05:26.160
So don't get confused that I hear I read in six states.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.750
I have read in six states.

05:28.750 --> 05:29.710
I agree.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.960
But those states.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.310
This is same as this.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.250
This is same as this.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.640
And this is serious.

05:43.710 --> 05:44.280
The state.

05:45.580 --> 05:45.820
Well.

05:47.060 --> 05:47.410
So.

05:47.420 --> 05:47.620
Yeah.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.620
We'll solve various good string problems.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.070
In the next.
