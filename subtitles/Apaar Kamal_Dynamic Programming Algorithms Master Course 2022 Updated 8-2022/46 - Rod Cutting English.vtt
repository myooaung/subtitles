00:00.710 --> 00:01.340
Hello, everyone.

00:01.490 --> 00:02.030
Welcome.

00:02.270 --> 00:05.150
And here is another partitioning problem.

00:05.420 --> 00:08.900
I call it partitioning problem because it is very similar to partition problems.

00:09.380 --> 00:14.510
But yes, this this problem will give you a deeper insight into the enemy and.

00:15.950 --> 00:19.730
It will tell you how these problems are created within the same problem.

00:20.510 --> 00:21.820
It's a very, very famous problem.

00:21.830 --> 00:23.330
If you have done it, then it's fine.

00:24.080 --> 00:24.930
You can skip it.

00:24.950 --> 00:26.490
But let's do this problem.

00:26.490 --> 00:28.520
Once it is, start getting problem.

00:29.540 --> 00:36.410
Given that all of London and an area prices of London including the cost of pieces of the of Lent weren't

00:36.410 --> 00:36.860
doing.

00:38.270 --> 00:40.700
So basically this is my first example here.

00:40.840 --> 00:45.050
The Iran has aligned it to say we have a right.

00:45.150 --> 00:45.860
It has a end.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.510
It is our unit.

00:48.980 --> 00:51.560
And we have this area which is called prices area.

00:52.370 --> 00:55.460
So this area is also L.A., which is one.

00:56.090 --> 01:02.810
So we can see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, the maximum zone that can

01:02.810 --> 01:06.710
be made if the road is cut up optimally.

01:07.310 --> 01:08.210
So what does it mean?

01:09.970 --> 01:13.810
If I want to cut that out later, I want to cut it into some pieces.

01:14.090 --> 01:20.440
So, first of all, let's discuss how many pieces or things are possible if I want to cut it into something.

01:21.680 --> 01:25.390
So, Leslie, if I have a lot of landed, I can cut into.

01:27.040 --> 01:31.250
It parts of land one instead of less likely.

01:31.270 --> 01:33.340
Let's not place a lot of time.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.820
21111118.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.970
So this is a lot of land.

01:39.970 --> 01:42.790
It got into one woman and parts and the.

01:43.890 --> 01:52.020
But before moving on this one small thing that happened, I tried to explain the number of means of

01:52.020 --> 01:54.450
partitioning and into positive digits.

01:54.720 --> 02:00.690
Of course, you all might not have encountered the video because that lecturer has been moved on to

02:00.690 --> 02:03.780
the subsequent season dynamic programming section.

02:04.140 --> 02:10.230
So it's fine if you move on to that section and maybe try that problem, but it's still fine if you.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.470
And in the standard district rate, the second rate.

02:14.620 --> 02:20.380
So if I'm getting into one land end of it, but then what is the total cost?

02:20.380 --> 02:20.850
It'll delegate.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.760
What is the land of getting what?

02:24.300 --> 02:26.980
What is the price of cutting the garden length one.

02:28.010 --> 02:30.650
It is one only 8 to 1 plus one Belmont.

02:30.650 --> 02:31.370
Pleasant, pleasant.

02:31.370 --> 02:32.100
Pleasant, pleasant.

02:32.100 --> 02:32.810
Place one is it?

02:33.330 --> 02:40.130
Here I can see that the maximum amount that I have got after getting into this is often it.

02:40.130 --> 02:41.210
Is it too.

02:41.270 --> 02:43.730
There are other other possibilities as well.

02:44.630 --> 02:47.420
The other possibility can be cutting into one in seven.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.280
Now what is the price of one?

02:49.280 --> 02:50.120
It's one only.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.590
And what is the price of seven?

02:51.980 --> 02:54.530
We can see the price of an aeroplane.

02:54.530 --> 02:56.450
Seven is an eight.

02:56.810 --> 02:57.110
So.

02:58.510 --> 02:59.740
What is the total cost here?

02:59.770 --> 03:00.800
Total cost is 11.

03:00.820 --> 03:04.120
So you can easily see that this cost is greater than you'd like.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.420
There can be other ways also.

03:05.440 --> 03:10.180
Let's say I'm dividing the road into four, four and three in one.

03:10.750 --> 03:13.450
So it is all to the four for the cost is five.

03:14.570 --> 03:18.470
Less for three, the cost is four less or one.

03:18.470 --> 03:19.520
The cost is one.

03:19.830 --> 03:24.230
So what we can see, the total here is and again, we are getting on the number.

03:24.380 --> 03:26.390
But of course it is not greater than 11.

03:26.390 --> 03:30.230
I have to find the maximum price that I can get it.

03:31.380 --> 03:34.230
So yeah, this is like one of the example.

03:34.230 --> 03:40.100
I hope you're understanding what the problem is asking for and similarly what any question for let's

03:40.240 --> 03:46.140
let's try this because here any small four can be divided into one one, one one or it can be divided

03:46.140 --> 03:52.140
into one plus one plus one plus group or it can be divided into.

03:52.770 --> 03:53.790
So, okay, one more thing.

03:54.630 --> 03:55.680
Just just think about this.

03:55.740 --> 03:57.000
Does The Art of Matter material.

03:58.770 --> 04:01.890
Does the order of the pieces of the road matters?

04:02.130 --> 04:05.310
I mean, if you've got a road into one lane, then one lane, then to land.

04:05.850 --> 04:09.990
Is it different from getting it out into two land, one land and then one land?

04:10.850 --> 04:11.070
No.

04:11.070 --> 04:11.340
Right.

04:11.350 --> 04:17.460
Because what I see is of 112 will be same as prices of 211 because we are indirectly adding them well.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.380
So the order does not matter here, right?

04:20.400 --> 04:21.450
I just want an order.

04:21.450 --> 04:22.580
Two pairs, basically.

04:23.100 --> 04:28.110
I can say this one plus one plus two, or we can say it is two plus two or we can say it is one plus

04:28.650 --> 04:31.320
three and the last one can be it is four.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.830
What are the prices of all this?

04:34.110 --> 04:38.850
For one, we have the price one related one three, four, eight.

04:39.060 --> 04:44.490
So it is one plus one plus one plus one, which is for prices of this cart is one plus one plus one,

04:45.060 --> 04:46.890
three, one plus one.

04:47.830 --> 04:48.130
Ooh.

04:49.410 --> 04:50.910
One plus one again.

04:51.060 --> 04:52.890
Two and four for the prices.

04:53.400 --> 04:53.820
Six.

04:54.480 --> 05:00.480
So the maximum amount that I am able to generate is six out of all the possible cuttings.

05:01.070 --> 05:02.040
Eight, I hope.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.480
Now the problem is very clear.

05:04.550 --> 05:04.800
Well.

05:05.300 --> 05:05.710
But what?

05:06.020 --> 05:07.670
What should we the next steps?

05:07.670 --> 05:09.650
How should we approach this problem?

05:10.010 --> 05:16.850
I mean, usually what I have is I have a lot of land trade and I have some prices that I want to cut

05:16.850 --> 05:18.110
this garden, do some part.

05:18.960 --> 05:19.910
What I can say is.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.740
That guard that are into one part.

05:24.980 --> 05:26.810
Basically what we're doing, all the problems.

05:26.900 --> 05:32.030
We just try out different possible options and we take the best one among them.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.910
So let me firstly write a deep state.

05:35.810 --> 05:37.970
Let's say deep state deep.

05:38.210 --> 05:42.860
And a Libyan represents the maximum amount.

05:44.230 --> 05:45.040
Maximum amount.

05:48.500 --> 05:49.010
Possible.

05:50.790 --> 05:52.530
If The Art of London is good.

05:55.760 --> 06:01.220
Start of Lent and discard when it is finally done said.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.620
So basically the final answer for this problem should be it.

06:05.330 --> 06:07.090
But how do we calculate it?

06:07.700 --> 06:09.850
Right now we have a lot of land.

06:10.080 --> 06:15.500
It be able to be that there can be various ways of getting of it out of land.

06:16.220 --> 06:20.000
So we don't you know, we don't have to think twice ahead.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.650
We'll just we'll just think about one step ahead and that will be it.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.560
But what we can do is we can divide this aid into.

06:28.870 --> 06:29.260
See.

06:30.210 --> 06:33.120
It's I'm getting it out of Lent one in this.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.940
Then in that case, what will be my solution?

06:35.970 --> 06:40.110
It will be nothing but rice off one rice of one.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.060
Because I've got a lot of land one year.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.280
Less deep.

06:44.310 --> 06:47.790
Tell me, what is the maximum amount that can be generated?

06:48.390 --> 06:55.050
If I if now dheeraj lent is seven they or the second option can be if I got the fraudulent two.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.390
What is the rod which is remaining?

06:57.390 --> 06:58.140
It is of lent.

06:58.200 --> 06:58.650
Six.

06:58.950 --> 06:59.250
Eight.

07:00.830 --> 07:03.080
The price to bless DP.

07:04.120 --> 07:04.510
Six.

07:05.200 --> 07:10.480
I hope you're getting this by price, too, because I have little I've got that order lent to from the

07:10.480 --> 07:11.590
starting eight.

07:11.770 --> 07:13.900
So right now it is of lent it.

07:15.170 --> 07:16.220
This is their talented.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.230
And now I'm making a court of land.

07:19.310 --> 07:23.810
I'm saying, okay, if I make this card, I have a price for it with this price of two.

07:24.080 --> 07:27.070
And now just tell me what the remaining road me.

07:27.140 --> 07:28.000
What is the best answer?

07:28.820 --> 07:29.100
Right.

07:29.350 --> 07:33.410
Similarly, same thing will happen for three as well, which is price three.

07:34.690 --> 07:35.500
Let's be.

07:37.100 --> 07:41.690
Basically what's happening here is I'm doing all possible options from this starting and if I got it

07:41.690 --> 07:46.040
for Lent one, Lent to Lent three and four and five and six Lent and indented.

07:46.490 --> 07:50.000
This will go on till lent it in the end.

07:50.000 --> 07:50.660
What will happen?

07:50.660 --> 07:53.870
Price off it less DP zero.

07:54.860 --> 07:58.460
I hope this is being clear now.

07:59.750 --> 08:00.020
Yeah.

08:00.050 --> 08:00.470
Now.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.200
Tell me how deep seven.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.070
Take this.

08:04.760 --> 08:05.750
I would deep seven.

08:05.750 --> 08:09.800
You know, digging progressively deep seven will do the same thing.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.070
Right.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.920
It will divide that Oriental into one.

08:11.930 --> 08:17.840
It will say, okay, this price of one plus DP six and of.

08:18.950 --> 08:22.310
Lent to price of two plus and BP five.

08:22.460 --> 08:29.210
So if I want to generalize it, I can say that dpn is nothing medical to maximum of maximum of all the

08:29.210 --> 08:34.970
amounts that I can get and what amounts I can get, I can say it is price, i.e. because I'm getting

08:34.970 --> 08:42.560
that island of raw trade, no less BP and minus because the remaining raw that is left is and minus

08:43.280 --> 08:43.510
eight.

08:43.820 --> 08:44.600
And I'll just.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.970
This is my reconciliation here.

08:47.970 --> 08:52.140
I will start from one and I will go day and night.

08:52.320 --> 08:53.370
And what will I be?

08:53.370 --> 08:57.750
Excuses the deep zero in zero eight, the normal biscuits.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.430
If there's no land, there is no place.

08:59.880 --> 09:06.150
And we can simply apply this because of religion here we can see that there will be some overlapping

09:06.270 --> 09:06.660
problems.

09:06.660 --> 09:10.470
It's very clear here there'd be six and BP six.

09:10.530 --> 09:16.490
So there are six is being called two names, eight, and it's an overlapping problem.

09:17.260 --> 09:22.890
So I hope you have realized one thing that if DP six is called here and DP six is Scalia, we will return

09:22.890 --> 09:29.790
as the same value eight because deep six means Godard of land six into some parts and give me the best

09:29.790 --> 09:30.030
amount.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.840
It doesn't matter where it is called eight, it still is.

09:35.110 --> 09:36.010
The state that we want.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.980
Basically, I'm partitioning that out.

09:39.310 --> 09:45.370
I always think in this way that I'm partitioning that road and with the partitions I have a cost associated

09:45.700 --> 09:45.970
eight.

09:46.300 --> 09:53.290
Out of all the partitions, I'll take the one with the maximum cost and it and answer it and.

09:54.450 --> 09:59.370
Yeah, but this discussion can also be framed in this fear that, let's say I have it one.

10:02.170 --> 10:08.860
I want to partition these eight ones sets that cost of two ones to get a cost of one one together is

10:08.860 --> 10:09.430
price one.

10:10.510 --> 10:11.650
FOSTER Two runs is.

10:11.830 --> 10:12.430
RICE two.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.970
FOSTER Three runs, rice three and so on.

10:16.750 --> 10:21.430
So if I'm partitioning this into like, let's add this, this and this, what does this mean?

10:21.580 --> 10:25.690
It is one plus three plus three +182.

10:25.690 --> 10:28.100
The price of one price of two replace of three price of one.

10:28.390 --> 10:30.190
I'll add them and find out the answer.

10:31.090 --> 10:37.180
It is also a partitioning problem and partitioning it out of land8 into some part and I have a cost

10:37.180 --> 10:39.820
associated with each of the parts I just have.

10:39.820 --> 10:42.340
Do not handle this cost well.

10:42.910 --> 10:47.740
So in an expert will be escorted out and I hope you have understood the problem in this solution.

10:48.490 --> 10:49.420
Always remember.

10:50.430 --> 10:51.830
Just think about one step.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.390
If I have a lot of landed, I can have one.

10:54.390 --> 10:54.660
Good.

10:54.930 --> 10:56.040
I ask for the other.

10:56.100 --> 11:00.290
I don't think he lets cut it for Lent one then will cut it for Lent too.

11:00.300 --> 11:01.800
Then we might cut it voluntary.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.650
That's not what we want to hear.

11:04.770 --> 11:07.050
That's not what we want our mind to do.

11:07.050 --> 11:07.350
Right.

11:07.800 --> 11:14.340
We just want our mind to think of only one step ahead and ask for a recorded solution.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.400
Look, let me go read for Lent one and let me ask what?

11:17.400 --> 11:18.240
And minus one.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.690
Again, the recursive function will again do the same process.

11:21.690 --> 11:21.970
Right.

11:22.020 --> 11:23.010
You don't have to think.

11:23.010 --> 11:23.910
Two steps ahead.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.020
This thing one, step eight.

11:26.100 --> 11:30.990
And it's like step by step, you will reach the you find a solution.

11:31.470 --> 11:34.260
So these are thing like small enlargement.

11:34.590 --> 11:35.400
It's the same thing.

11:36.090 --> 11:38.130
We are having some small muscle problems.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.290
We are mixing them, we are making them.

11:40.290 --> 11:44.730
And finally, we are reaching the final problem and making the answer.

11:45.700 --> 11:45.930
Well.

11:47.370 --> 11:48.640
So just remember one thing.

11:48.660 --> 11:49.580
Don't think too much.

11:49.590 --> 11:53.310
Just think of one step ahead and you realize the solution.

11:53.940 --> 11:55.320
Well, in the next part.
