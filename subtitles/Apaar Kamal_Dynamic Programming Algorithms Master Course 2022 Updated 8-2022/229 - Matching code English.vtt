WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:00.780
Okay.

00:00.780 --> 00:01.350
So let's.

00:02.820 --> 00:04.080
Ryan called the brute force.

00:04.830 --> 00:05.180
What?

00:05.190 --> 00:05.390
What.

00:05.500 --> 00:06.780
What's happening in Brussels?

00:06.780 --> 00:08.460
We are always passenger sit.

00:08.670 --> 00:09.000
Right.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.580
I do not take more than five, 10 minutes.

00:11.580 --> 00:12.900
And we call the brute force.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.490
And then we'll understand why wondered book.

00:14.490 --> 00:17.010
And then we'll go dodging approach or.

00:19.370 --> 00:19.700
Okay.

00:20.180 --> 00:21.200
Let's go to the force.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.040
No problem at all.

00:22.640 --> 00:22.850
Great.

00:23.450 --> 00:23.810
So.

00:24.950 --> 00:28.850
Here we have CPI and it's the input.

00:33.170 --> 00:34.340
The end is very small.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.300
Let's take 20 to just an extra.

00:47.610 --> 00:52.560
So this is the edit and and lipstick and also it shall be are in.

00:56.010 --> 00:57.000
It's the input.

00:58.090 --> 00:58.720
For the Eddie.

01:00.090 --> 01:01.880
I'm digging a zero base indexing.

01:01.890 --> 01:03.240
Okay, so don't worry.

01:07.200 --> 01:07.480
Eight.

01:10.040 --> 01:15.860
Now what I simply said simply associate BP and what I'm passing embossing this card matching from the

01:15.860 --> 01:16.520
zero two men.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.020
I'm bringing zero waste indexing.

01:18.530 --> 01:21.470
And what is the state government which is available.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.610
So here I have to pass a separate specific.

01:26.450 --> 01:27.440
Not a big deal for us.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.470
And they said this w the women were only eight.

01:31.860 --> 01:33.450
So right now all the women are available.

01:33.540 --> 01:34.800
So let me optimize it.

01:36.500 --> 01:36.830
Okay.

01:38.190 --> 01:38.820
Well, I.

01:41.430 --> 01:42.480
W w insert.

01:44.000 --> 01:44.570
But w.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.490
I right now I have all these.

01:50.880 --> 01:51.150
Okay.

01:51.150 --> 01:55.230
So what I can also do is I can do it in the booth in order to rate that.

01:57.460 --> 01:59.710
Instead of filling the blue with all human women first.

01:59.930 --> 02:05.290
If, let's say the blue represents the woman, what they can say, then we don't.

02:05.530 --> 02:08.740
Then what we for all the eggs were not belonging to the blue.

02:09.190 --> 02:10.690
Then again, it will be a good solution.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.190
Ladies.

02:13.580 --> 02:20.300
I mean, w can be a set of women or taken or w can be a set of women can both of them can work.

02:20.310 --> 02:20.710
Right.

02:20.720 --> 02:25.340
Because they they're kind of same thing, only just the way of representing real change.

02:26.030 --> 02:27.290
So yeah.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.880
So here I'm passing w right.

02:30.050 --> 02:34.500
So here we have in B, B and I'm on some men and here we have.

02:35.730 --> 02:36.030
That.

02:38.090 --> 02:39.260
W Wait.

02:39.530 --> 02:40.180
So what?

02:40.280 --> 02:41.150
Lewis Oh.

02:43.770 --> 02:44.130
Yeah.

02:44.640 --> 02:44.940
Let's.

02:44.940 --> 02:45.810
Let's do one thing.

02:46.760 --> 02:47.310
Hmm.

02:48.270 --> 02:49.860
Well, let's take another.

02:51.540 --> 02:52.290
Or let's not.

02:52.290 --> 02:53.430
They're going to set a.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.100
Well, let's iterate overall the values of women, because as we can see that there are only 21 women.

03:02.100 --> 03:06.120
So it won't make much difference if I do over the set of women or 21 women.

03:06.660 --> 03:06.960
Eight.

03:07.230 --> 03:13.290
So here I go with all the women from zero to N, and I'll see if W don't find.

03:13.920 --> 03:20.400
That means if that woman is equal to w don't find w dot.

03:20.520 --> 03:21.420
And that means.

03:22.630 --> 03:25.150
If I'm not able to find that woman in the city.

03:25.150 --> 03:28.420
So it's a normal way of finding whether someone is dead in the state or not.

03:29.380 --> 03:34.420
So if she is not okay, if she is not, then they say that means she is.

03:36.320 --> 03:36.950
They can write.

03:36.950 --> 03:43.020
So our royalties if it is not equal to W and that means she's in she's in the third and she's only eight

03:43.220 --> 03:44.120
and what else's.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.160
And also if M.

03:47.750 --> 03:48.770
Gomer, I.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.960
I hate women here we are talking about.

03:51.350 --> 03:52.370
And that should be the one.

03:54.150 --> 03:54.450
Eight.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.380
If both of them are true, then what I'll do is I simply say, Let's dig on it.

03:59.770 --> 04:00.070
Iran.

04:00.070 --> 04:05.380
Syria goes to zero to answer pressing question which are D, B and plus one comma.

04:06.340 --> 04:06.510
Yeah.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.300
And you have to process it without the eight women that I'm taking.

04:10.300 --> 04:11.650
So instead of I'll take.

04:13.090 --> 04:18.310
But let's take it as two weeks that we have taken in the because of solution that we have written in

04:18.310 --> 04:18.730
one note.

04:20.000 --> 04:20.280
Eight.

04:20.990 --> 04:22.330
Go ahead and begin.

04:22.640 --> 04:26.210
Rachel Gibson excellently tried to process it with outtakes.

04:26.210 --> 04:28.250
So what I'll do is I'll simply say w dot.

04:31.370 --> 04:33.320
I just forgot how to remove it from the set.

04:34.630 --> 04:34.950
Not yet.

04:34.990 --> 04:36.730
When we remove it, should we raise?

04:39.140 --> 04:39.470
Yeah.

04:39.710 --> 04:41.760
Let's say weather drugs are not so WW.

04:41.960 --> 04:47.480
And once it is for the next iteration, I want extra an extra B inside W again.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.340
So I'll simply insert X back.

04:49.730 --> 04:51.140
This is what backtracking is.

04:51.500 --> 04:56.630
It will help the W because now W does not contain x and written down so.

04:58.770 --> 04:59.180
Always.

04:59.730 --> 05:02.870
So why should there be a space when M equals two?

05:02.880 --> 05:08.790
That means when it goes to end, it means there are no more mines to Mars and there is no more woman

05:08.790 --> 05:09.540
available also.

05:09.900 --> 05:11.790
What we simply will simply return one.

05:12.060 --> 05:16.950
That means we have found a way to which all of it has been matched.

05:17.400 --> 05:17.700
Cool.

05:19.300 --> 05:23.680
That means we have found a way and finally there will be added flexibilities and together it's working

05:23.680 --> 05:24.160
or not.

05:24.850 --> 05:25.800
Okay, so it's working.

05:25.810 --> 05:26.680
Have you got three.

05:27.370 --> 05:27.970
Mm.

05:28.060 --> 05:28.420
Okay.

05:28.420 --> 05:29.410
Let's say for this.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.350
It's normal brute force that I've already explained to you.

05:33.370 --> 05:33.920
Okay, one.

05:34.330 --> 05:35.710
I think we are getting correct answers.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.870
And this this one will be really big.

05:37.870 --> 05:41.770
So I don't think the government will be able to optimize it.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.870
But let's see if America doesn't hang.

05:45.630 --> 05:45.990
Okay.

05:45.990 --> 05:49.380
So it's building this, I don't know, but it's taking a lot of time.

05:49.960 --> 05:50.700
It's a knowledge.

05:50.710 --> 05:51.390
Let's understand it.

05:51.390 --> 05:53.280
Why is it taking a lot of time?

05:53.850 --> 05:56.700
Because and it's not doing only those and it's trying to do one.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.410
But let's talk about this.

05:59.530 --> 06:01.210
W right here.

06:01.210 --> 06:05.260
What we can see is that there's too many paths that can be taken.

06:05.560 --> 06:09.130
The first man can match with, let's say in the and woman.

06:09.660 --> 06:09.970
Right.

06:09.970 --> 06:14.680
So we have and different pods again will have in different parts then again for the second when we live

06:14.680 --> 06:15.130
and different.

06:15.220 --> 06:22.540
But the tournament again will have and different branches and this recursion it's kind of going for

06:22.540 --> 06:31.780
like and what in and of course guys we are passing a cert with 21 values that will also be huge eight

06:32.110 --> 06:34.180
does to optimize this said part.

06:34.390 --> 06:35.290
What we do is.

06:36.660 --> 06:39.150
We use bird masking nature.

06:39.150 --> 06:40.320
Here is a new term for you.

06:41.280 --> 06:46.620
If you are not able to solve this problem in one go, then no problem at all because it's a new topic

06:46.620 --> 06:47.670
for your mask.

06:48.150 --> 06:51.210
So here we'll take one really, which is called bird mask.

06:51.570 --> 06:58.440
That means I simply instead of picking a woman in a suit, I take them as.

06:59.860 --> 07:00.790
Binary numbers.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.850
I take them as set bits of an integer.

07:04.420 --> 07:05.290
What does it mean?

07:06.100 --> 07:08.780
Well, so initially, let's say all women available.

07:08.800 --> 07:09.760
That means I have.

07:11.130 --> 07:16.910
And woman availability for now and is equal to one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

07:16.920 --> 07:17.220
eight.

07:17.700 --> 07:23.360
That means what is this number is if I talk about this number in decimal form, there it is due to the

07:23.370 --> 07:25.320
poverty rate minus one, which is.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.340
I guess, to revive.

07:28.610 --> 07:29.420
Right if I'm not wrong.

07:29.570 --> 07:29.870
Yeah.

07:30.020 --> 07:31.770
So this is device binary.

07:31.790 --> 07:33.680
That means right now, all women are available.

07:34.220 --> 07:37.010
Isn't this a shorter way to describe that?

07:37.010 --> 07:37.310
Yes.

07:37.310 --> 07:41.400
A woman can be considered, as I said.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.500
Bit of a number for this particular example.

07:45.500 --> 07:51.020
If I'm considering them, as I said, bits of a particular number, then it will be easy for me to find

07:51.020 --> 07:51.500
this out.

07:53.770 --> 07:55.190
It will be easy for me to find.

07:55.210 --> 08:00.040
First of all, it will be easy for me to ask, where do we go?

08:00.640 --> 08:02.550
Yeah, to pass Ray by.

08:02.680 --> 08:09.040
Because now we will be passing a number initially instead of women with every instead of us shared with

08:09.040 --> 08:09.740
every woman.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.710
What we will do is we will be passing.

08:14.480 --> 08:19.860
Numbers will be passing to 55 initially instead of all the women and also age.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.660
What you can do is let's see if you want to memorize it.

08:22.670 --> 08:23.030
Right.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.970
Let's say you want to memorize this approach only.

08:24.980 --> 08:27.800
So let's take a map int and set.

08:29.130 --> 08:33.030
Eight and it's trying memo is it and let's see whether it's bugs or not.

08:34.260 --> 08:36.600
So what we have is.

08:38.460 --> 08:38.880
Okay.

08:39.450 --> 08:40.020
I think.

08:41.680 --> 08:45.580
Your intense editing won't work great because that will be a key and that will be evaluated.

08:46.120 --> 08:52.910
We want to memorize it on the basis of intense and we also want to distort the value of answer to hate.

08:53.410 --> 08:56.410
So here, what I can do is I can take a period.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.200
Better would be to take a pair here.

09:03.430 --> 09:08.620
So I'm just going deep into this because I want you to understand how does it actually work?

09:10.430 --> 09:10.680
Yeah.

09:10.700 --> 09:17.000
So India I think they should work maybe have a pair of income a certain which is m w and this integer

09:17.000 --> 09:18.740
will be this answer variable then I'll restoring.

09:20.180 --> 09:22.100
So, so let's see the answer.

09:22.940 --> 09:23.210
Okay.

09:23.690 --> 09:33.050
So let's say if Ambedkar found, that means if m map contains this m comma search w that means I'll

09:33.050 --> 09:35.090
simply return and be.

09:36.390 --> 09:38.080
M Gomer w cool.

09:38.100 --> 09:41.160
So this is normal memorization for map.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.560
Either way, the answer is equal zero.

09:43.560 --> 09:46.680
And whenever I whenever I am any, I simply stored it in my.

09:48.850 --> 09:50.590
MWD goes to answer it.

09:50.680 --> 09:51.640
So let's check this.

09:53.370 --> 09:53.760
Okay.

09:54.300 --> 09:55.750
It should be you.

09:59.830 --> 10:00.280
Okay.

10:00.550 --> 10:03.660
Again, it's taking a really long time, even after memorizing.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.250
Let me cancel the world and let me go back and take some smaller inputs.

10:13.220 --> 10:13.400
So.

10:13.400 --> 10:13.700
Yeah.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.950
So first wallaby input, it's working correctly.

10:15.950 --> 10:18.560
That means we are doing something better, right?

10:20.220 --> 10:22.710
Well and for larger bullets.

10:22.710 --> 10:23.670
Let me run it once.

10:23.670 --> 10:24.090
And.

10:25.330 --> 10:26.530
The other time we can.

10:28.780 --> 10:33.250
I'm also not even sure about the memory limit that it will take because see how many students we have

10:33.250 --> 10:41.020
we have and across the how many states are possible to use that of women to do the power insert possible

10:41.020 --> 10:41.410
so there.

10:42.490 --> 10:47.860
So it is and cross to do the power in and of course we are passing a set so it will contain.

10:49.910 --> 10:53.920
In the end, the numbers, they said we're going to introduce numbers in the worst case.

10:53.930 --> 11:00.440
So see, still, it is being run and it is being built and it's not giving me any idea what that means.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.690
It's taking a really, really long time.

11:02.960 --> 11:06.290
And of course, guys, you can easily see that the inside.

11:08.220 --> 11:09.150
Solution for this.

11:09.420 --> 11:10.230
Just give me a second.

11:11.410 --> 11:18.610
So it would be very convenient for us to pass indeed just insert offsets and then so and then checking

11:18.970 --> 11:24.790
whether woman that means whether a woman exists in the said list or not.

11:24.790 --> 11:26.980
We can easily take that by manipulation.

11:26.980 --> 11:29.650
That's very easy to say whether a Buddhist said for a number or not.

11:30.200 --> 11:30.520
Eight.

11:30.880 --> 11:37.030
But there's just one small change that is, instead of us said, what we will be doing is we will be

11:37.030 --> 11:40.630
having another in this area which will call big mosque.

11:41.380 --> 11:46.420
And I think it's great mosque great because this big mosque will help us memorize things.

11:47.050 --> 11:52.930
And guys, what can be the worst case for us like means how many ones can be said forward mosque only

11:52.930 --> 11:54.400
and one's height.

11:54.490 --> 11:58.210
So insert the leftmost sorry the rightmost and once so that.

11:59.370 --> 12:03.680
Which makes which will be called due to the power in minus one state.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.580
So if an is ten, then it is 1023.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.950
So of course sugar is 1000.

12:07.950 --> 12:13.800
23 can easily be passed eight and it's a very small digit so here and is equal to 21.

12:14.100 --> 12:18.660
Then the worst is it can be to the power 21 minus one, which is.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.520
I don't know how much it is.

12:21.060 --> 12:22.500
It's printed.

12:23.730 --> 12:24.480
Also let me.

12:24.780 --> 12:27.330
It is all of only this part eight.

12:28.510 --> 12:29.380
And yeah.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.730
Let me raise this said.

12:32.550 --> 12:32.880
Okay.

12:33.290 --> 12:34.800
Let's see how much it is.

12:37.290 --> 12:37.830
To the deep.

12:37.830 --> 12:40.020
Our end minus one.

12:43.090 --> 12:44.770
Third is about 21 minus one.

12:49.270 --> 12:49.980
Which is not big.

12:49.990 --> 12:53.790
One, two, three, four, five, 600 and over six approximately.

12:54.130 --> 12:55.480
It's not a big integer.

12:55.480 --> 12:56.890
We can easily memorize it.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.370
We can easily take that big of an 88.

13:00.880 --> 13:05.470
So now let's try and collaborate for a solution using this bridge masking approach.

13:05.800 --> 13:06.060
Eight.

13:06.850 --> 13:10.300
So I just use a previous approach only anchored out in this.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.750
But what we have here, we have.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.460
Okay, let's start again.

13:15.610 --> 13:16.390
Let's say X.

13:16.390 --> 13:17.410
Let's talk about X.

13:23.330 --> 13:28.790
From, sometimes it becomes quite difficult to explain and go simultaneously.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.880
And also, if you get errors, then it becomes more tough.

13:32.810 --> 13:34.700
So it starts from zero go still.

13:34.710 --> 13:42.350
And now if I want to check whether Woman X is there in my set, that means if she's not already, if

13:42.680 --> 13:44.510
she's there or not, then how will I do?

13:44.930 --> 13:46.970
I will check very simple rate.

13:47.060 --> 13:53.960
That means I just have to check whether the bit off where the next bit of this number is set or not.

13:54.980 --> 13:58.910
So let's see, it's called a variable called said.

13:59.630 --> 14:07.430
And how can I check whether the British say they're not native but must extremes and take and with one.

14:08.370 --> 14:12.150
By this way, we can easily check whether the extra British said or not.

14:12.210 --> 14:13.320
So it's a very easy approach.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.050
Guys, I'm not going into detail of this.

14:16.350 --> 14:20.610
You should you should have easily gone you should have gone in with a bit manipulation section in this

14:20.610 --> 14:20.940
course.

14:21.630 --> 14:22.530
Hate and no words.

14:22.530 --> 14:29.220
This again, but that whether she's compatible or not, mate, I'm just taking everything the compatible.

14:30.030 --> 14:35.610
This is he goes to each of em comma x that we have already done mate.

14:36.090 --> 14:41.400
If if she's available, that means the British said and she's compatible.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.100
Hey, then what we'll do is we'll simply added in the mind.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.510
So let's dig in on the variable.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.440
What will be a mind to the recursive?

14:49.750 --> 14:51.790
Approach, which is BP and plus one.

14:52.270 --> 14:53.740
It means the next man.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.120
Is that fine?

14:55.150 --> 14:56.840
Give me the number of these match.

14:56.860 --> 14:58.900
The remaining men with the women were available.

14:59.530 --> 15:01.930
And now, guys, what will be the Red Mosque?

15:02.500 --> 15:09.670
So now we know that we have to unmask that particular woman who who is compatible with the current because

15:09.670 --> 15:15.940
we are able to imagine the woman X eight to how to uncertain from a number.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.420
I would want there to be Trump number.

15:19.570 --> 15:20.240
Very easy.

15:20.260 --> 15:28.200
If I do this that bit Musk and let's see the other one let's shift extinct.

15:28.210 --> 15:31.050
That means I'm taking a number which is truly barbaric.

15:31.090 --> 15:34.450
So the dead breed has come left extremes.

15:34.740 --> 15:40.090
I if pickings are with this number, all the numbers in me insane and this big and this bit changes

15:40.540 --> 15:47.020
8000 and 1.0 is one and it's always one reverses the bit.

15:47.500 --> 15:52.120
So I'm simply taking the auto bit mass with the ground weird and passing it as the next video.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.790
But not not it should not again be a big issue.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.390
So here we have answer.

15:57.450 --> 15:58.980
Let's see whether it's working or not.

15:59.340 --> 15:59.640
Okay.

15:59.760 --> 16:04.070
So here's what we need to parse is initially how many women are available for the first woman.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.970
One left shift and minus one.

16:08.890 --> 16:10.380
That means all of them are available.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.910
All the better suited for this number eight.

16:13.140 --> 16:17.100
So if you even if you don't know what this number is, you can print it out in check.

16:17.760 --> 16:22.680
This is on the move with all the bits that it has and reads it eight.

16:26.500 --> 16:29.440
So let's run on Smartest Guys and then we can memorize it.

16:32.360 --> 16:33.380
So what's the problem here?

16:33.680 --> 16:34.280
Base case.

16:34.490 --> 16:35.660
If our music was to in.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.240
They're done well.

16:40.780 --> 16:41.070
Cool.

16:41.380 --> 16:41.650
So.

16:41.830 --> 16:42.160
Okay.

16:42.190 --> 16:42.700
Not cool.

16:42.730 --> 16:42.970
Yeah.

16:43.310 --> 16:43.560
Here.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.230
We've got one.

16:44.230 --> 16:45.550
And in this, we have two.

16:46.780 --> 16:47.600
You're right.

16:47.650 --> 16:48.620
It's looking great.

16:48.890 --> 16:50.770
Just so just not taking set.

16:50.770 --> 16:53.440
We are taking away from us this distorted.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.100
So here we are.

16:54.100 --> 16:58.060
What we are doing is we are trying to optimize recursion that is done in programming.

16:59.040 --> 17:02.280
But now by digging, it must begin easily.

17:02.280 --> 17:02.670
Memories.

17:02.670 --> 17:03.600
It ain't so.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.620
Let's take anecdotes for 21 only.

17:07.590 --> 17:15.030
To memo and because for this particular EMP and what is the scan value it is one left shift in.

17:16.550 --> 17:22.010
Good because beard mask and take these many values, these many big values which is not much above a

17:22.010 --> 17:24.170
six into 21, can be taken easily.

17:25.550 --> 17:26.230
So how to to.

17:27.050 --> 17:28.550
Here, let's do this memo.

17:29.790 --> 17:32.220
3 a.m. and musk.

17:34.070 --> 17:35.840
At stake the answer variable.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.140
Well.

17:38.220 --> 17:42.120
And if answer is an article two minus one.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.380
It's an answer.

17:46.400 --> 17:51.560
The right answer is zero at all the combinations ended in me dancer in Italy.

17:51.560 --> 17:52.550
Let's that.

17:54.090 --> 17:54.690
Memo.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.290
KOMO minus Anchorman signs off memo.

18:01.880 --> 18:02.620
It's working.

18:02.650 --> 18:04.070
Not sick for other cases.

18:05.090 --> 18:06.080
Sick for a big case.

18:09.240 --> 18:15.600
So it took time to win 4 seconds of building and ending and giving me out, but it gave me out.

18:16.080 --> 18:16.920
That's what matters.

18:17.190 --> 18:17.650
Now, this.

18:17.670 --> 18:18.750
This outboard is not going to.

18:20.850 --> 18:21.200
Why?

18:21.660 --> 18:22.410
Because of.

18:23.700 --> 18:24.540
And it wasn't aimless.

18:24.540 --> 18:25.110
It went late.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.500
So I just have to bring the output with this particular.

18:29.550 --> 18:30.390
More value added.

18:30.390 --> 18:34.410
So let's take mode and wherever we are doing in addition in.

18:38.830 --> 18:40.620
The onset will take more.

18:40.940 --> 18:41.380
Hey, Joe.

18:41.770 --> 18:42.730
We only have.

18:46.310 --> 18:48.470
In over and over and strange.

18:48.920 --> 18:49.910
Let's just ignored.

18:51.870 --> 18:53.640
So what I have is 10251.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.540
Yeah, I think it's good.

18:55.230 --> 18:56.000
I hope you got this.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.190
Of course, it's taking a bit time.

18:59.010 --> 19:03.240
Let's say it's taking a little bit of time, but still, it is far better than the said approach.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.830
And here we have 2/2 time limit.

19:05.250 --> 19:09.180
Now, of course, this is a longer compiler and you all must know that.

19:10.630 --> 19:15.040
The online compilers does not take full time into consideration.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.170
They only take the execution time into consideration.

19:17.560 --> 19:18.790
18 Look at what happens.

19:18.890 --> 19:23.170
A lot of lot of calls being made locally and then compilers is being.

19:25.050 --> 19:26.220
And on and other things.

19:26.340 --> 19:26.630
Eight.

19:28.250 --> 19:35.270
So yeah so let's some of course guys the thing is that we have got an output for this case.

19:35.540 --> 19:36.800
You do read Musk.

19:37.690 --> 19:40.420
Because bird mask is actually masking my birds.

19:40.990 --> 19:42.790
And what does those birds represent.

19:43.060 --> 19:48.760
Woman whatever level eight and compatibility in both of them I take to.

19:50.420 --> 19:50.670
Got it.

19:50.760 --> 19:54.650
So we ran the scoring in 1077 milliseconds.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.130
So I don't think it's bad.

19:56.150 --> 19:56.900
It's really good.

19:57.560 --> 19:57.950
And.

19:59.850 --> 20:02.730
If you want to, you can even optimize it for the rate.

20:02.730 --> 20:07.560
But I don't think it's needed because again, it's running in half of the time.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.380
To take in was a limit and it's running in 1/2.

20:10.860 --> 20:11.370
It's good.

20:11.670 --> 20:12.720
Not no problem at all.

20:13.340 --> 20:14.700
Well, so I hope you understand.

20:14.910 --> 20:15.900
Understood this, guys.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.280
Thanks a lot.
