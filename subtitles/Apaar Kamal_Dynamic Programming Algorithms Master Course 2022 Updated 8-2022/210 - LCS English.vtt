00:00.770 --> 00:01.460
Hello, everyone.

00:01.980 --> 00:11.550
Welcome to this problem f you and see us so else this means our longest common subsequent rate.

00:11.570 --> 00:14.810
So if I have two strings we have been given to a strings.

00:14.810 --> 00:20.930
S&amp;P find one longest string that is the subsequent soft boot S&amp;P rates.

00:20.930 --> 00:26.260
So basically the longest common subsequent which is present in both of the strings.

00:26.630 --> 00:29.720
What is the difference between subsequent and surpassing?

00:33.740 --> 00:39.470
So for a subsequent what are going to have we going to have to do the power ends up sequences.

00:39.830 --> 00:47.000
So if I have a BCD, that means a, a, the subsequent, B, the subsequent, b, c is a, subsequent

00:47.030 --> 00:49.270
b, b, the subsequent eight.

00:49.370 --> 00:55.220
So basically, all these places have two options, and that will come in the subsequent order, not

00:55.220 --> 01:00.830
come in the subsequent third is doing the two into two into two, which is sort of the power forward

01:00.830 --> 01:03.280
in this case, which is 68.

01:03.290 --> 01:11.150
So it includes an empty substring, also an empty string also, which is also a subsequent of the string

01:11.480 --> 01:11.790
nature.

01:11.790 --> 01:14.990
An empty string can also be a subsequent eight.

01:14.990 --> 01:21.920
So if I say if I have two strings A, B, C, D and E, F, G, H, this is S and this is what is the

01:21.920 --> 01:22.940
longest common.

01:22.940 --> 01:27.830
So in this case, what is the longest common subsequent in this case goes.

01:29.700 --> 01:30.690
It's zero eight.

01:31.380 --> 01:32.310
There is nothing in common.

01:32.310 --> 01:37.320
That means an empty subsequent is common in both which has length of z2.

01:38.140 --> 01:38.440
Eight.

01:39.910 --> 01:41.590
So let's come back to the problem.

01:42.280 --> 01:42.550
Yeah.

01:42.580 --> 01:43.810
So we have been given dosing.

01:43.810 --> 01:45.330
We have to find the longest common subsequent.

01:45.340 --> 01:47.140
It's a very, very standard problem.

01:47.470 --> 01:53.890
Generally what happens is we are asked to find the length of the longest common subsequent instead of.

01:56.060 --> 01:56.480
The.

01:58.240 --> 02:02.890
Subsequently it's a rate so as already I've already like.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.000
Explained how to trace back rate.

02:06.420 --> 02:07.200
There's what we will do.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.950
Firstly, you will find the length of the longest common subsequent and then we trace back their length

02:10.950 --> 02:12.570
that particular land.

02:12.870 --> 02:14.370
Where is it coming from?

02:14.910 --> 02:20.000
And when we see those connections then we'll be tracing back and we will take those characters into

02:20.010 --> 02:21.030
our strings.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.160
So yeah.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.000
So what are the constants?

02:25.000 --> 02:28.720
SNP are strings containing lowercase letters.

02:28.720 --> 02:35.860
So we have 26 characters and the length of would S&amp;P is less than equal to 2000.

02:35.860 --> 02:39.460
So that means s and squared can, right.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.500
That is 3000 to 3000 converge.

02:41.710 --> 02:44.380
It will be nine, six, eight.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.870
So it's a very famous problem, guys.

02:46.870 --> 02:52.030
And most of you might know this too, but here it is just to like trace it back.

02:52.030 --> 02:52.990
We need to trace it back.

02:53.140 --> 02:58.960
Eight So print one longest string there is subsequent of all this insti if they're multiple testing,

02:58.960 --> 03:04.510
any of them will be accepted grading eight So if there are multiple, of course there can be multiple.

03:04.660 --> 03:05.740
Let me give you an example.

03:07.400 --> 03:07.760
Because.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.190
Longest comments I've seen has a fixed length.

03:11.640 --> 03:16.530
Great length cannot be multiple because there will be one maximum, but the strings can be multiple

03:16.560 --> 03:16.800
night.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.970
For example, if I have ABCD and I have, let's say a.

03:23.170 --> 03:23.520
Be.

03:24.440 --> 03:24.850
Eddie.

03:25.490 --> 03:25.820
Hey.

03:25.850 --> 03:26.450
So here.

03:27.350 --> 03:29.030
Okay, here I am, getting three.

03:33.550 --> 03:33.800
Okay.

03:33.850 --> 03:34.750
So let me.

03:35.770 --> 03:37.120
Or reverse this.

03:37.990 --> 03:39.160
What I get is I get.

03:40.750 --> 03:41.960
And their b.

03:42.250 --> 03:42.570
E.

03:42.850 --> 03:43.060
B.

03:43.090 --> 03:43.330
D.

03:44.560 --> 03:44.960
Really?

03:45.370 --> 03:46.260
Or I did.

03:47.470 --> 03:47.880
Eddie.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.350
Right in both cases.

03:51.010 --> 03:53.380
And I don't think there's any other idea.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.030
Or maybe it's not possible.

03:55.030 --> 03:55.250
Why?

03:55.270 --> 03:59.080
Because in the subsequent case, the order matters, right?

03:59.320 --> 04:00.900
It Abi's Nazim is Bea.

04:01.780 --> 04:03.070
Abi's different from Bea.

04:04.120 --> 04:08.170
Right because they are not the same things in subsequent.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.450
Always remember that order matters.

04:11.140 --> 04:14.120
But I hope you understood the difference between subsequent seasons of things.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.130
So let's move forward.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.290
What I have here is those strings.

04:26.560 --> 04:26.890
Great.

04:27.400 --> 04:34.390
Well, first of all, we will, like, try to generalize it by writing a normal recursion and then will

04:34.390 --> 04:34.930
memorize it.

04:35.260 --> 04:35.890
Not a big deal.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.620
Okay, so before then, let's understand this.

04:39.010 --> 04:39.880
How does it work?

04:41.560 --> 04:46.780
Hey, so some of you might have known the table approach of the tabulation approach in which we are

04:46.780 --> 04:50.290
starting from the top left corner and filling according to the constraints.

04:50.290 --> 04:55.390
But I'll do the different I do the just opposite approach, which is that because of approach, which

04:55.390 --> 04:58.930
will ultimately help you understanding the tabulation approach.

04:59.290 --> 04:59.530
Right.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.680
So here I was doing this and I think this is.

05:04.610 --> 05:05.240
B.

05:06.570 --> 05:07.370
By X.

05:12.140 --> 05:12.470
Yeah.

05:13.190 --> 05:16.470
What else is I first of all, define a function, right?

05:16.490 --> 05:18.000
So what should that function be?

05:18.020 --> 05:21.050
That was the output that we want.

05:22.510 --> 05:25.000
The longest thing that is subsequent about a century.

05:25.300 --> 05:29.220
So what I will do is I simply ask, what is the length of the longest thing?

05:29.230 --> 05:36.100
So as I told you, if I'm able to find the length and then I am able to trace back where that length

05:36.130 --> 05:42.060
come from, and I can simply make the same to say you'll see this in know is it?

05:42.070 --> 05:42.610
Don't worry.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.480
So let's define a function called F and.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.290
Um.

05:49.300 --> 05:49.630
Yeah.

05:49.690 --> 05:51.100
So let's see if I go.

05:51.100 --> 05:51.530
Maggi.

05:53.380 --> 05:58.570
Here, I'll pass two variables which are islands, and these variables will see it.

05:59.050 --> 05:59.470
What?

06:00.510 --> 06:03.540
Is the land.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.100
Of longest.

06:12.880 --> 06:13.390
Barman.

06:15.860 --> 06:16.760
A sequence.

06:20.810 --> 06:30.140
S of zero do I that means only this prefix of as is considered till I rate it means I it index and.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.320
EOF zero two JS considered.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.840
So basically what have what's happening here?

06:38.320 --> 06:46.000
I'm trying to find out the length of the longest comment subsequent, if I'm certain, as is considered

06:46.000 --> 06:46.780
and some certain.

06:47.810 --> 06:54.350
But if is considered starting from Maryland and not starting from the end, I'm saying if some 13 prefix

06:54.350 --> 06:55.730
are both, these things are considered.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.380
So there will be a final answer.

06:57.390 --> 07:03.830
If I talk about the final answer, it will be if I if I say the index is zero based or let's do one

07:03.830 --> 07:05.480
based, one this indexing.

07:08.750 --> 07:08.960
Well.

07:09.110 --> 07:11.440
So the final answer will be at F.F. and Goma.

07:11.450 --> 07:14.030
And what is anyway and is the length of office.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.140
And Emmis is linked with.

07:21.020 --> 07:24.350
So now let's come to this approach where it is eVerify, is it?

07:24.350 --> 07:29.990
It is a length of the longest common subsequent if if s of some prefix s is considered and some prefix

07:30.350 --> 07:34.250
is considered, when always let's find let's figure out the solution.

07:34.850 --> 07:35.630
So here I have.

07:36.760 --> 07:42.910
E x y b e b vi x.

07:43.450 --> 07:49.330
So listen to this very carefully, because it will help you solve various problems, various problems

07:49.750 --> 07:51.490
regarding strings, maybe on strings.

07:52.060 --> 07:54.810
So let me give you an example of a problem.

07:54.820 --> 07:58.750
It's called interleaving leaves, I guess, in the leaving strings.

08:00.170 --> 08:03.620
After solving this, just move on to this problem, which is interleaving.

08:04.720 --> 08:05.890
Things only good.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.760
It's interleaving only, I guess.

08:09.960 --> 08:14.190
So it's kind of very similar problem and the approach that I'm going to tell you this will help you

08:14.190 --> 08:16.950
solve various problems on our divisions.

08:17.970 --> 08:18.540
What is it?

08:18.810 --> 08:20.700
First of all, we start from F of.

08:24.110 --> 08:24.500
Zero.

08:24.860 --> 08:25.820
What I can say is.

08:26.780 --> 08:27.080
Yeah.

08:28.030 --> 08:28.690
What I'll do is.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.180
Let's start from the zero eight index.

08:32.180 --> 08:33.530
And what does this mean?

08:33.980 --> 08:37.430
Okay, so indexing is one base rate for this meager table.

08:37.910 --> 08:39.080
Leslie, let's make a table.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.720
Then we'll discuss the recursive approach to.

08:41.870 --> 08:44.240
And then what we'll do is we'll like good both of them.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.730
There shouldn't be anybody.

08:49.080 --> 08:52.500
Let's make the tabular approach first and.

08:58.520 --> 09:02.750
So as has lent for sort of let me give some indexes.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.380
And the length of.

09:08.300 --> 09:08.690
Okay.

09:08.690 --> 09:09.050
So.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.060
It's important the table.

09:13.050 --> 09:14.910
I have this fire and this is six.

09:16.510 --> 09:20.920
Insert cable is five rows.

09:34.780 --> 09:35.290
Yes.

09:35.290 --> 09:36.760
And it's expanded a little.

09:40.850 --> 09:41.150
Okay.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.010
Let's index them one by one.

09:43.010 --> 09:45.950
So this is zero one, two, three and four.

09:46.370 --> 09:49.190
But why am I starting it from zero?

09:49.200 --> 09:51.470
Because zero represents an empty string.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.170
So let's say that zero represents an empty string.

09:54.650 --> 09:54.950
Eight.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.630
And one represents the first year.

09:57.630 --> 09:58.800
Next year I have e.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.080
So let me write it also here.

10:02.090 --> 10:04.300
X, Y, Z.

10:04.820 --> 10:08.000
And similarly, let's index the right part of it.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.500
-- again.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.880
Start starting from zero.

10:17.460 --> 10:19.890
So here I have this thing, which is a.

10:20.490 --> 10:22.590
B, y x.

10:22.970 --> 10:29.760
B Well, so let's talk about the zero true rate, the zero true.

10:29.790 --> 10:32.280
So what should be in the zero rule?

10:32.460 --> 10:33.630
So let's come back to this.

10:36.130 --> 10:39.880
Statement that the length of the longest common subsequent if.

10:40.830 --> 10:44.480
S of this is considered anti of this is considered eight.

10:44.750 --> 10:48.240
So as I said, that zero represents an empty thing.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.580
So let's say s of zero is equal to two.

10:50.580 --> 10:53.040
You have zero wages and I am destroying it.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.470
So what is the length of the longest common subsequent?

10:55.470 --> 10:56.070
In this case?

10:56.670 --> 10:57.450
It will be zero.

10:58.300 --> 10:58.550
Eight.

10:59.080 --> 11:05.830
As zero basically f00 is zero y because both are empty.

11:05.830 --> 11:08.570
There is nothing which is common right now.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.690
Let's talk about f01.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.740
What does this mean?

11:14.130 --> 11:20.950
That when I have an empty string and at the second place I have a that's what one means, right?

11:21.000 --> 11:30.150
It means the if I consider the length of B to be one that has only one character in it, it will contain.

11:31.130 --> 11:33.650
Or does the lender, the government, think it is?

11:35.880 --> 11:38.460
085 because here I am destroying.

11:40.130 --> 11:48.380
So now let's consider the zero comma two place, which means that if I consider as to be an empty string

11:48.710 --> 11:54.410
and B to be a B, because we are moving to the second place, we have to take the prefix string.

11:54.990 --> 11:58.250
What is the length of the longest common subsequent zero?

11:58.250 --> 11:58.460
Right.

11:58.460 --> 12:00.590
So with an empty string it will be zero.

12:01.370 --> 12:07.100
Similarly, with an empty string moving downwards, it will be zero y because these cells.

12:07.100 --> 12:09.110
Let's talk about the cell for common zero.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.870
This represents the B's empty here.

12:13.220 --> 12:16.560
And Ford is s, that is X, Y, Z.

12:17.150 --> 12:20.870
So there is nothing common between a string and an empty string.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.430
So it has to be zero.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.270
I hope you got these biscuits.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.870
These are the normal biscuits and.

12:28.160 --> 12:28.430
Yeah.

12:28.490 --> 12:29.360
Let's move forward.

12:29.360 --> 12:29.780
And.

12:31.170 --> 12:32.390
Think about this.

12:33.060 --> 12:33.360
Eight.

12:33.570 --> 12:35.340
Which is one comma.

12:35.340 --> 12:35.790
Once in.

12:36.700 --> 12:37.760
It goes.

12:38.410 --> 12:39.850
Now, here's the main part, of course.

12:40.420 --> 12:42.220
How is F of one?

12:42.220 --> 12:43.810
Common one is being formed.

12:43.870 --> 12:46.120
We have to think about the transitions right there.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.720
How is f of one come up?

12:47.720 --> 12:48.730
One is being formed.

12:48.910 --> 12:49.150
Eight.

12:49.540 --> 12:49.990
There are.

12:52.590 --> 12:57.810
Two is already highlighted three ways to eliminate one of the three ways it can be formed.

12:59.060 --> 13:00.190
If I see their.

13:01.540 --> 13:04.120
If I see that again, give me the length of the longest.

13:04.660 --> 13:06.670
Okay, so quickly, let me.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.400
Give you another explanation of it.

13:09.950 --> 13:12.460
So what is the one when it is a coma?

13:13.500 --> 13:16.320
It in both these things.

13:16.570 --> 13:18.880
So this is fingers and this this thing.

13:20.050 --> 13:25.330
In both these things, I have any on the board on board the seats because I know I'm talking about f

13:25.330 --> 13:26.170
of one comma one.

13:27.420 --> 13:30.090
So where does everyone go when this and this?

13:31.300 --> 13:33.340
Ladies, this is I for one moment.

13:33.340 --> 13:41.230
This means this much seeing these considered and this much as is considered the how how can I form this

13:41.230 --> 13:44.230
much the and this much is there are two ways of it.

13:44.510 --> 13:45.430
They their.

13:46.800 --> 13:54.510
I will simply say that I heard an MP sing s first and sing E and I appended it with.

13:55.740 --> 13:56.940
This is a first approach, right?

13:57.300 --> 14:03.510
It can be the longest moments of sequence if that particular part of it is considered.

14:03.540 --> 14:09.270
That means do you consider one index and as is considered, do zero index and I'm simply appending after

14:09.270 --> 14:09.380
it.

14:09.900 --> 14:11.010
Second part of it is.

14:12.900 --> 14:17.730
If S is a these empty and I'm appending after it.

14:19.160 --> 14:19.430
Hey.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.230
So, yeah, let me raise this.

14:23.160 --> 14:23.370
Well.

14:23.490 --> 14:25.680
And what does it hurt bad guys if.

14:27.870 --> 14:30.040
We know that both Ayeni is at sea.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.470
Then the third part is simple.

14:31.950 --> 14:32.730
That if.

14:33.910 --> 14:38.080
Both of them are empty right now and I'm simply burning after them.

14:38.410 --> 14:43.390
And I'm burning after both of them to the length of the longest comment subsequent increases.

14:44.440 --> 14:46.990
So again, let me repeat it.

14:48.220 --> 14:52.690
When I have two characters right now or both of these characters, it would be good, right?

14:53.280 --> 14:57.730
So how can I how can I make Swing E and A in both the yes?

14:58.450 --> 15:03.550
So in essence, what I can do is I had an empty string earlier and I'm simply a binding e in the iron

15:03.550 --> 15:04.560
and and destroying a layer.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.550
I am simply appending it.

15:05.650 --> 15:06.940
And what's the second case?

15:07.360 --> 15:14.530
Second case is if I had this string in S and it in B, so I'm not appending anything anywhere.

15:14.920 --> 15:21.070
And otherwise the next case is if I had in this and empty string in the D and again I'm not appending

15:21.070 --> 15:21.700
anything anyway.

15:21.970 --> 15:26.380
These are the three cases in which we can region two is right.

15:26.410 --> 15:28.450
We have basically we have three options.

15:29.320 --> 15:29.800
So.

15:36.520 --> 15:36.970
After this.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.510
What we do is first we completely establish an approach.

15:39.530 --> 15:44.580
We will move on to the recursive approach, which is far more simpler than this.

15:45.790 --> 15:52.660
But what so what happens is I simply if both these characters are same, if I have two, is that means

15:53.110 --> 15:57.160
if both these characters are same, then I can include them in my longest common sub sequence.

15:58.090 --> 15:58.260
Right?

15:58.570 --> 16:06.700
So if both the characters, which is A s of A is equal to T of g, that means give me that.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.920
What is the longest comments of sequence?

16:10.180 --> 16:13.630
Well, I'm minus one and minus one eight.

16:14.110 --> 16:18.760
And give me what is the longest common subsegments in the previous two places and add one.

16:19.910 --> 16:20.200
Right.

16:20.390 --> 16:22.540
As if both these characters are not same.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.470
Then what I'll do is if.

16:24.770 --> 16:26.390
As what is that is Kasia.

16:26.690 --> 16:29.420
And she simply means that these two characters are not same.

16:29.420 --> 16:34.010
That means essay's not equal to these essays, not equal to T.J..

16:34.010 --> 16:38.800
What does it mean that I can up an essay after considering the T.

16:39.850 --> 16:47.680
D sync or I can append easy after considering this a string that means it can be maximum both.

16:47.680 --> 16:47.970
Right?

16:49.150 --> 16:49.870
In other words.

16:49.870 --> 16:54.130
In other words, in like simple English, it means that added.

16:56.120 --> 17:02.390
It means that right now I'm taking S&amp;P in the longest government's subsequent rate.

17:02.810 --> 17:04.070
That's why I added one year.

17:04.500 --> 17:09.590
So right now, if I'm on some characters and they're not equal, I considered one to the longest Goldman

17:09.590 --> 17:14.180
substituents because both of these characters cannot be taken into the longest Goldman subsequent.

17:14.420 --> 17:16.880
If both of them cannot be taken, then they should be.

17:16.880 --> 17:17.660
The answer kept.

17:17.990 --> 17:19.250
The answer should be added.

17:21.310 --> 17:23.800
Max of f of I minus one.

17:25.650 --> 17:30.300
Gee, that means I'm simply not including S8.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.460
So this means I'm not including.

17:34.150 --> 17:36.780
Essay into my longest comment subsequent.

17:38.370 --> 17:42.530
Late or what happens is what is this the way it is edited?

17:42.600 --> 17:43.620
You do not include.

17:44.370 --> 17:45.060
Don't include.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.020
Easy.

17:49.170 --> 17:49.420
Eight.

17:50.100 --> 17:53.250
So it is fourth day, minus one.

17:54.130 --> 17:54.610
Right, guys.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.220
Why did I do I.

17:56.240 --> 17:56.650
Minus one.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.470
Minus one here.

17:57.490 --> 17:59.620
Because now I'm adding the both these characters.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.930
So I'll say, okay, these are the same problem, Steve.

18:01.960 --> 18:02.950
Both of these strains.

18:03.190 --> 18:05.740
And tell me that what is the.

18:07.750 --> 18:13.510
What is the longest moments of sequence of both these things and add one to them because I'm adding

18:13.510 --> 18:16.380
both these characters to the previous things, right?

18:16.420 --> 18:19.270
Or the answer can be maximoff.

18:20.740 --> 18:26.080
F r you minus one g which means och considers consider listing dil the only.

18:26.470 --> 18:31.690
But consider listing added means consider this thing s of zero.

18:31.690 --> 18:32.080
Do I.

18:33.190 --> 18:36.520
Or consider this thing which is b of zero to.

18:38.330 --> 18:39.710
So it is a minus one way.

18:39.830 --> 18:41.620
So just consider the privacy part.

18:41.630 --> 18:45.890
That means I'm not including the Iot character in my longest common subsequent.

18:45.890 --> 18:46.850
I'm simply removing it.

18:47.210 --> 18:47.520
Eight.

18:48.590 --> 18:54.410
So these are the three options that we have, either include both of them together or do not include

18:54.410 --> 18:55.100
any one of them.

18:55.700 --> 19:00.260
They don't include that or don't include this or don't include both of them.

19:01.070 --> 19:01.370
Eight.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.330
So let's come back to this table and let's flip, fill it one by one.

19:08.670 --> 19:10.970
What is a in this case, guys?

19:11.240 --> 19:18.020
When I'm talking about 411, what we have is we have equal to here because essays equals rupees.

19:18.260 --> 19:20.630
So what happens when essays equal strategic?

19:21.710 --> 19:25.580
They simply take the diagonal value, which is a four by minus one G.

19:27.390 --> 19:33.120
Minus one G minus one, which stores the best answer for the previous prefixes of S.A.?

19:33.120 --> 19:38.460
And I add one to it, so I'll have one over Y because ain't what these A's seem.

19:38.870 --> 19:43.740
And so that means I'm including both these A's and upending them after the longest comment subsequent

19:43.830 --> 19:44.730
which ended it.

19:45.090 --> 19:46.680
This place ain't.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.030
Now.

19:49.490 --> 19:52.160
Let's talk about one gunman, two bodies.

19:52.160 --> 19:58.100
And so here I have A and B to be seem so the NBA not equal essays not equal to teaching.

19:58.910 --> 20:00.940
What happens when essays not equal duty g.

20:02.650 --> 20:03.700
We take Max off.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.420
For Fi minus one g.

20:08.780 --> 20:12.380
That means if a few minutes one day means this part.

20:15.320 --> 20:15.590
Eight.

20:16.010 --> 20:20.840
Tell me, what is the maximum subsequent if I considered this much to end this much as.

20:21.910 --> 20:26.940
Okay and do not and we react that it normal, right?

20:27.300 --> 20:29.350
So what is the maximum to zero or.

20:30.260 --> 20:37.990
The next is F off I go mountain j minus one y it is I going to do minus one that do not add the g connected

20:38.000 --> 20:40.250
in to my longest comment subsequent.

20:40.250 --> 20:40.910
So this is.

20:42.840 --> 20:48.370
Are you going to do minus when this fight like this much de and this much as so what was the end of

20:48.370 --> 20:49.600
the longest game and subsequent?

20:49.900 --> 20:57.160
If this much the end as much as is considered it is one ultimately at one of it I invite because max

20:57.160 --> 20:58.390
of both this are.

20:59.240 --> 21:02.360
But I hope you're getting this through for any.

21:03.610 --> 21:07.010
Sell a comedy if both these are equal.

21:07.030 --> 21:08.980
I'm simply asking for this solution.

21:10.220 --> 21:10.390
Eight.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.360
This plus one.

21:12.660 --> 21:15.810
Otherwise, I'm taking the maximum of this or this.

21:17.010 --> 21:22.260
So similarly, what we'll have is we'll have one, one, one or whatever because is never equal.

21:22.670 --> 21:24.860
And let's move on to X again.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.220
Let's talk about this place.

21:26.220 --> 21:28.830
We just have one place here.

21:28.830 --> 21:35.340
What I'll have is both of them are not equal, while the maximum of both eight and similarly maximum

21:35.340 --> 21:35.580
both.

21:35.580 --> 21:36.300
Maximum both.

21:36.300 --> 21:39.210
But nowadays you can see that to four is equal.

21:39.720 --> 21:44.850
Eight we have s of two equals two so as to offer the here what is the case?

21:45.300 --> 21:49.560
If both of them are equal, I can simply I can simply appended to the.

21:50.460 --> 21:54.150
Longest common subsequently which is being made by this particular.

21:56.710 --> 21:59.700
Strings, which is this and this.

21:59.740 --> 22:03.140
So what is the length of the longest common subsegments which is made by these things?

22:03.160 --> 22:05.050
It is kept over this place.

22:05.710 --> 22:06.030
Right.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.030
So what is the word?

22:07.150 --> 22:08.330
What it is, it is one.

22:08.350 --> 22:10.450
So I have simply one plus one with just two.

22:11.080 --> 22:18.820
So basically I'm adding X to the length of the longest common sequence for the previous strings.

22:19.870 --> 22:20.270
Right, guys.

22:21.460 --> 22:23.170
Well, let's move forward.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.360
Nevada, I have X and be here.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.790
I'll get the maximum of two and it is too late.

22:29.160 --> 22:35.190
So whenever we are getting an increment, it is because of the diagonal element, the diagonal element

22:35.670 --> 22:39.690
by because we have the same characters are abandoning them.

22:40.280 --> 22:44.070
Okay, so I'll help you trace back and it will become more clear when you trace it back.

22:44.340 --> 22:45.750
Let's fill this table quickly.

22:46.300 --> 22:51.400
We have by and read by and be again one vine by.

22:51.450 --> 22:52.620
Right now I can have two.

22:53.690 --> 22:54.920
Then we have X and Y.

22:54.980 --> 23:00.950
So again, I going have two, maximum is two and then I can have been, but again the maximum is two.

23:01.730 --> 23:03.500
So this is again B anyway.

23:03.530 --> 23:04.940
So we have maximum one.

23:06.230 --> 23:08.030
So I hope you're getting this vibe.

23:08.330 --> 23:09.250
We got one away.

23:09.590 --> 23:10.490
We got one over here.

23:10.490 --> 23:13.670
Because let's consider this these two things.

23:14.100 --> 23:17.000
What does the maximum comment subsequent in these two listings?

23:17.030 --> 23:20.450
It is a very this is coming from here.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.580
This is coming from here.

23:21.590 --> 23:22.520
This is coming from you.

23:22.820 --> 23:28.010
When we are moving upwards, that simply means that I'm not including these characters when we are moving

23:28.010 --> 23:29.360
leftwards in this table.

23:29.390 --> 23:31.340
That means I am not including these characters.

23:31.670 --> 23:37.460
But when I'm going diagonal, I'm moving to this place, which is F of a minus one and minus one.

23:37.460 --> 23:40.040
That means I'm including the current character.

23:41.020 --> 23:41.350
Right.

23:42.680 --> 23:43.570
Eight silver.

23:44.470 --> 23:46.060
Communities despite.

23:48.710 --> 23:49.000
There.

23:49.000 --> 23:49.780
I have one again.

23:49.780 --> 23:50.320
I'll have one.

23:50.320 --> 23:50.920
I'd like to.

23:51.760 --> 23:52.000
Okay.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.970
So I'd be ready to be an ex again.

23:56.080 --> 23:56.760
Now being be.

23:56.770 --> 23:59.110
It is a good place to start.

23:59.110 --> 23:59.980
It is two plus one.

23:59.980 --> 24:00.610
It is three.

24:01.980 --> 24:02.280
Right.

24:02.790 --> 24:06.510
So finally what we got is the length of the longest gun and subsequent history.

24:06.810 --> 24:08.310
Now, that is the most important part.

24:08.310 --> 24:11.340
Let's trace it back from where is it actually coming?

24:11.730 --> 24:13.500
Okay, so how do I trace it back?

24:13.980 --> 24:17.400
I start from the last three and then I check.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.560
Where is this tree coming from?

24:19.890 --> 24:22.470
Is it coming from this, these two places?

24:23.220 --> 24:23.520
No.

24:23.520 --> 24:24.090
Right by.

24:24.100 --> 24:29.250
Because when we are talking about these two places that is up in the left side place, which is I minus

24:29.250 --> 24:31.350
one G and I go magic minus one.

24:31.780 --> 24:36.480
So these two places, we get maximum of these two places, but this is three and the maximum is too.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.270
That means these two these two characters were equal.

24:39.960 --> 24:42.060
So it has come from the diagonal element.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.650
So let's move diagonally.

24:44.010 --> 24:44.970
Now, guys, this two.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.930
We can see it is VI and X.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.370
These two are not equal.

24:51.090 --> 24:57.030
That means this two has not come from the diagonal element, nor does it ever came from the above or

24:57.030 --> 24:57.900
from the left hand side.

24:58.290 --> 24:59.410
So here we have two options.

24:59.430 --> 25:00.630
I can go up also.

25:00.630 --> 25:02.490
I can go left also.

25:02.490 --> 25:02.750
Right.

25:02.760 --> 25:03.960
So let's go anywhere.

25:04.200 --> 25:04.920
It doesn't matter.

25:05.370 --> 25:06.210
Let's move up.

25:07.440 --> 25:12.870
So when we moved diagonally backwards, that means they included being too along this common up sequence.

25:13.080 --> 25:16.860
And then I'm moving up, and when I'm moving left, it means I'm not including that character.

25:17.250 --> 25:18.470
Eight or two.

25:18.780 --> 25:19.080
Yeah.

25:19.110 --> 25:23.040
Now we have X in x eight, so both of them are equal.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.930
That means this is coming from the diagonal element.

25:24.930 --> 25:28.200
So again, I've included X into my longest common up sequence.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.430
Now, this one has come from this one.

25:30.450 --> 25:33.720
This one has come from this one, but this one has gone from zero.

25:33.870 --> 25:34.960
So we are moving diagonally.

25:34.960 --> 25:38.520
And also I simply include the character here, which is a.

25:40.560 --> 25:40.790
Okay.

25:40.950 --> 25:43.260
So what is the length of the longest common subsequent record?

25:44.090 --> 25:45.240
We got XP.

25:46.390 --> 25:51.280
Always when we trace back, will get a divorce kind of thing, then we'll reverse this later.

25:51.310 --> 25:53.910
So, yeah, so we've got ex-FBI.

25:55.400 --> 25:56.400
I wish I.

25:56.450 --> 25:58.460
We are getting this part like.

25:59.660 --> 26:04.610
When we are coming diagonally, we are including that element because it has to be including the longest

26:04.610 --> 26:09.290
comment subsequent given by the previous strings of borders in other ways.

26:09.350 --> 26:10.400
If that is not.

26:11.540 --> 26:17.840
It is either coming from the top or the left side, which is F4 y, minus one j or a comma minus one.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.200
This simply means that I'm not including the current character.

26:21.310 --> 26:21.620
Right.

26:22.950 --> 26:26.160
So yeah, this was about the ALP's yes.

26:26.520 --> 26:27.570
Abolition approach.

26:28.230 --> 26:30.240
And now let's discuss the recursive approach.

26:30.550 --> 26:30.840
Hey.

26:33.940 --> 26:34.240
Okay.

26:34.660 --> 26:40.960
So let's discuss the legacy approach in the next tutorial in which I look forward to seeing the next

26:40.960 --> 26:41.200
part.
