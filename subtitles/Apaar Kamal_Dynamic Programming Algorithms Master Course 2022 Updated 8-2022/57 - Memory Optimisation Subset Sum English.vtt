WEBVTT

00:01.270 --> 00:02.450
Did a very small mistake.

00:02.470 --> 00:05.320
Instead of zero zero, they should be 0g8.

00:05.740 --> 00:06.790
So let me really dig in.

00:07.720 --> 00:07.960
Yeah.

00:07.990 --> 00:08.530
Not very good.

00:08.530 --> 00:09.220
Zero 420.

00:09.550 --> 00:11.860
I hope that's very clear.

00:11.890 --> 00:13.480
Made in Italy.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.790
I in 000.

00:15.790 --> 00:17.650
It was a tiny mistake.

00:18.440 --> 00:18.630
Yeah.

00:18.710 --> 00:20.630
Now, this solution is perfect.

00:21.530 --> 00:24.740
So if you want me, I can bring the table as well.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.310
Let's bring the table.

00:29.150 --> 00:30.080
We copy this.

00:33.260 --> 00:33.890
And.

00:38.780 --> 00:41.440
I mean this out, we'll just simply say CO2.

00:43.850 --> 00:45.020
Give some space.

00:48.740 --> 00:49.480
And start this.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.190
But will the summit strategy do?

00:55.570 --> 00:55.850
And.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.230
Who did?

01:00.940 --> 01:04.600
What is the value of an okay hybrid?

01:05.360 --> 01:06.280
One more mistake.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.480
And this is a serious mistake.

01:08.930 --> 01:09.130
Yeah.

01:09.570 --> 01:13.460
So it got deleted maybe, or something.

01:13.460 --> 01:14.090
And I just.

01:14.090 --> 01:16.910
I'm just taking to someone, and here you can see that.

01:17.760 --> 01:28.380
This will be very similar to the one that we had there, donated 10101111 and 010 and 118.

01:28.560 --> 01:29.740
So this is going to continue.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.200
That's right.

01:31.210 --> 01:31.850
Whether it will.

01:34.750 --> 01:35.110
Yeah.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.980
Pardon me for this input and this small.

01:40.670 --> 01:40.990
Right.

01:41.660 --> 01:43.010
Both are not logical errors.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.060
So.

01:45.140 --> 01:45.400
Yeah.

01:45.420 --> 01:46.590
So what about.

01:46.610 --> 01:48.680
Well, this is about it.

01:49.820 --> 01:52.820
This problem was about optimizing the memory complexity.

01:53.130 --> 01:58.760
Here you can see guys that what's a memory that I'm taking it is and plus run into some pleasant physically

01:59.240 --> 01:59.960
and into some.

02:01.010 --> 02:01.310
But.

02:02.680 --> 02:05.470
Do we actually need an into some memory for all of this?

02:06.790 --> 02:09.880
Our time complexities also enter into some very.

02:10.980 --> 02:16.830
So what we will do is we'll just see that for a particular cell, what all values are, values that

02:16.830 --> 02:23.130
you can easily see for any isomers using are you minus one G, which is just the above one.

02:23.460 --> 02:25.800
And this again is a B idea.

02:27.960 --> 02:34.190
Second is, I mean, as one day might say, that means this is also in the above only aid.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.650
That means or enero.

02:36.950 --> 02:38.000
I'm just using the.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.390
I'm not using the rule above the above rule.

02:41.450 --> 02:41.930
That means.

02:43.050 --> 02:49.530
I'm not using I minus two 0488 I'm not using I'm minus two I'm not using I minus three I'm not using.

02:49.530 --> 02:58.180
I mean, basically when I was feeling this particular rule, which is let's say for Road Forward, I

02:58.200 --> 03:02.700
only used three the values which were in road three because it did x minus one, an x minus.

03:03.210 --> 03:05.240
I did not use the values which are in row two.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.560
Did not use the values which are one.

03:09.870 --> 03:10.170
Zero.

03:10.430 --> 03:11.750
It means what I need.

03:11.870 --> 03:13.540
I just need the through.

03:14.470 --> 03:14.890
Values.

03:15.550 --> 03:17.380
So why am I keeping this huge?

03:18.620 --> 03:18.890
Eight.

03:20.320 --> 03:25.510
Firstly, let me tell you the purpose of me expanding on the memory, complexity, legacy and as it

03:25.510 --> 03:27.910
was to bend is to diversify.

03:28.840 --> 03:29.050
Cool.

03:29.380 --> 03:29.920
And let's see.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.440
The summit equals to end is to the power.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.920
Well, then in sum, are this What will be the time complexity of the solution?

03:39.910 --> 03:41.080
Ambiguity will remain seen.

03:41.500 --> 03:50.530
It is an interim which is end is to the power and I am just having some calculations or does this display

03:50.530 --> 03:58.360
it space complexity here because complexity will be an interim if I don't optimised it, which is stand

03:58.360 --> 03:58.870
is too boring.

03:58.870 --> 04:00.990
But let's see if I optimize this space complexity.

04:02.330 --> 04:05.420
Optimize this complexity.

04:07.230 --> 04:08.970
Then MySpace.com declared eliminating.

04:08.970 --> 04:14.670
I'm just keeping two rows eight if I'm calculating the current drive on the previous road.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.240
And the current rules calculated, I'll make it equal to the previous row.

04:18.510 --> 04:19.230
And then again.

04:21.050 --> 04:21.290
Well.

04:22.540 --> 04:22.960
So.

04:23.380 --> 04:24.760
So we just need to do it right.

04:24.810 --> 04:27.580
And and I quoted it very clear to you also.

04:27.670 --> 04:30.140
It isn't a thing we're doing to him, which is doing the same.

04:30.610 --> 04:31.750
It's the they the him is.

04:34.730 --> 04:35.390
Go ahead.

04:35.690 --> 04:37.370
What is the total space complexity now?

04:37.370 --> 04:39.410
We have it is 205.

04:39.590 --> 04:40.640
It is visible.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.660
So if I try to call the normal approach.

04:45.890 --> 04:52.240
My local PC will give me a memory limit, exceed family memory limit accidentally.

04:52.320 --> 04:56.070
It cannot initialize this big memory to the tag.

04:56.080 --> 04:56.890
Or what is it?

04:57.520 --> 04:57.780
A.

05:00.720 --> 05:07.800
If I try to optimize this space in space and then build it, then as you can see, guys.

05:08.950 --> 05:10.300
The program will run.

05:10.840 --> 05:14.650
Of course, the program will run for like ten, 20 seconds.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.510
It depends on your compiler.

05:16.840 --> 05:22.660
It is also a huge complex Dennis report and it will do so many iterations, but at least it will run

05:23.470 --> 05:23.680
it.

05:23.860 --> 05:27.940
I read it was not running because of Emily, but now at least it will run and give me a month.

05:29.230 --> 05:29.390
Eight.

05:29.980 --> 05:32.680
You can always optimize space complexity.

05:34.110 --> 05:35.460
Let me quickly.

05:39.600 --> 05:39.990
Put it.

05:41.890 --> 05:45.490
Escorted by optimizing the base.

05:48.040 --> 05:48.210
Okay.

05:48.340 --> 05:56.140
I'm telling you all of this because all of this space, time and optimizing your time, all these things

05:56.140 --> 06:00.900
are applicable to the other two GDP problems, other three GDP problem that.

06:01.880 --> 06:05.130
I won't be repeating or like, you know, tracing back.

06:05.150 --> 06:07.970
I won't be repeating all of this for all the problems.

06:08.750 --> 06:15.860
Well, and I will not repeat all of this for all the problems that it's your duty to try to, you know,

06:17.540 --> 06:22.250
try to optimize this piece or piece back the answers if you are curious enough.

06:22.760 --> 06:23.540
What's the answer?

06:24.440 --> 06:25.370
So it's not repeated.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.420
It's in the.

06:27.560 --> 06:27.860
So.

06:30.740 --> 06:33.380
Well, let's not remove this.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.550
What we can do is.

06:36.470 --> 06:37.580
And this is also fine.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.530
It's removed from here.

06:44.140 --> 06:44.270
Yeah.

06:44.290 --> 06:45.670
Let's change it in this code.

06:45.670 --> 06:50.200
Only though we want just to be.

06:51.660 --> 06:51.850
Right.

06:52.460 --> 06:56.620
And this is the bullying tree.

06:57.850 --> 06:58.020
Yeah.

06:58.540 --> 07:02.350
You know, to take a vector and by taking a vector to actually become that easy.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.090
Because you can always.

07:04.090 --> 07:04.710
In these days of.

07:05.620 --> 07:05.890
But.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.880
Let me tell you one, one, one more.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.650
So let me give you one more surprise.

07:12.070 --> 07:16.270
You don't even need this to go down this to the par five.

07:17.680 --> 07:21.850
And just pause that we didn't think about it, that you don't need to do this.

07:21.850 --> 07:22.390
Need one.

07:23.850 --> 07:25.890
But just think about it.

07:25.890 --> 07:27.600
One why you need only one room.

07:31.560 --> 07:34.480
What if you overwrite the data in the same row again?

07:35.220 --> 07:38.100
I'm saying override because we know.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.670
Let's see if I have two rows.

07:41.020 --> 07:41.710
Five, two rows.

07:42.670 --> 07:43.120
And.

07:44.850 --> 07:46.380
Or calculating this.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.150
I'm using this.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.820
So why am I calculating it?

07:50.820 --> 07:54.780
The video, Vinod, I just overwrite it over here because I want this.

07:54.780 --> 07:55.590
It's already there.

07:55.590 --> 07:57.360
And I want something previous to this, which is.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.600
I don't need the down low, I just need one row.

08:02.600 --> 08:07.400
And I can always override values in it because whatever I need is already in that room.

08:07.880 --> 08:08.930
It's already capped there.

08:09.260 --> 08:12.470
And the other part is I'm a bit on the left of it.

08:15.280 --> 08:15.530
Okay.

08:15.610 --> 08:18.800
So we'll solve this by using one rule in the next video.

08:18.860 --> 08:21.130
Right now, let's just focus on euros.

08:22.270 --> 08:23.100
But have you ever understood.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.990
Repositories to DP zero two.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.550
The first row is filled with falls.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.830
I would start from zero feet.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.480
Now.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.190
What will happen now?

08:34.210 --> 08:34.850
What will happen?

08:35.480 --> 08:41.670
So basically the pecking order I'm feeling is kind of be which is deep.

08:41.910 --> 08:42.620
I Yeah, true.

08:44.000 --> 08:54.650
I get through eight so I'm feeling the air through is that control for my this euros is the second I'm

08:54.650 --> 08:55.940
filling by using the first row.

08:56.660 --> 08:59.330
So the first row will be zero zero liquidated.

09:00.730 --> 09:02.860
A straw deep zero.

09:03.830 --> 09:05.800
Here is sick in.

09:07.430 --> 09:10.670
Is deep fun to be able to do those.

09:12.490 --> 09:14.620
And what I do here is I do nothing.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.380
But I just see that DP.

09:18.250 --> 09:18.700
One.

09:19.720 --> 09:26.440
Day eight is equal to BP zero day in April.

09:26.920 --> 09:27.820
And if.

09:29.240 --> 09:29.500
Yeah.

09:29.540 --> 09:30.380
What was the second one?

09:30.380 --> 09:31.130
Let me try to do.

09:32.060 --> 09:37.880
BP one is already close to a p e role.

09:38.940 --> 09:40.760
A-minus E.

09:43.670 --> 09:49.500
So if a minus A is greater than equal to zero, then.

09:52.180 --> 09:52.960
I hope this is clear.

09:53.920 --> 09:54.550
What's happening?

09:55.060 --> 09:55.780
You know, it's failed.

09:56.770 --> 09:57.580
I'm building one.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.080
Now what will happen?

09:59.080 --> 09:59.980
This gym will finish.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.570
That means the first row has been filled.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.960
Now this first row should become the zero through.

10:04.240 --> 10:07.720
But now, again, the row will fill because I will move ahead.

10:08.070 --> 10:11.050
It's I go straight to what I exist for.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.100
When I go straight to.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.620
Then I'm again filling the second row by using the first row.

10:15.310 --> 10:20.560
So much row should have the same value as the second row after this finishes.

10:20.910 --> 10:21.520
Basically it is.

10:21.520 --> 10:26.680
I'm actually copying second row into the first row so you can use mem copy also.

10:26.710 --> 10:27.010
But.

10:28.020 --> 10:29.100
I'm just using this.

10:31.900 --> 10:32.590
Is it all?

10:32.590 --> 10:37.870
To some, I just simply say zero is equal to DP one.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.620
Is it clear, guys?

10:42.980 --> 10:43.880
This is nothing but.

10:45.140 --> 10:45.760
Poppy.

10:46.810 --> 10:50.830
Must go to the classroom or.

10:51.980 --> 10:56.180
Next I calculation, one extra calculation.

10:57.350 --> 11:02.330
So for any rule, for any I rule, we always had the first row fill and it will keep.

11:04.310 --> 11:05.090
And finally.

11:06.340 --> 11:07.840
We can print now.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.940
We can not print all the rules, but we can.

11:10.150 --> 11:11.770
But in defining on it.

11:11.770 --> 11:13.340
Justice, ipsum.

11:14.540 --> 11:20.240
And we can also optimise it further to that later in next video and.

11:20.960 --> 11:21.200
Yeah.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.420
Oh, I hope.

11:24.780 --> 11:25.110
Okay.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.800
I think this again something we.

11:32.100 --> 11:38.880
It's not a B and some it is DP one some aid because they're trying to do this and then it.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.890
They're only two rows and not Andrew's.

11:42.490 --> 11:42.760
Yeah.

11:43.300 --> 11:43.600
So.

11:44.510 --> 11:45.230
This is it.

11:45.230 --> 11:48.730

11:48.740 --> 11:51.020

11:53.310 --> 11:55.690

12:04.530 --> 12:05.410
next video or we lose.

12:05.430 --> 12:06.300
We'll use just one.

12:07.460 --> 12:07.820
You just.

12:07.820 --> 12:11.600
You will have just one room and the English.

12:12.970 --> 12:14.770
Well, I see the next part.
