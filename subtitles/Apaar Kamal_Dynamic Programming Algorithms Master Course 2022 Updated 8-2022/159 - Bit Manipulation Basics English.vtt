00:00.690 --> 00:01.410
Hello, everyone.

00:02.130 --> 00:04.380
So let's begin with the pivot with Musk.

00:04.530 --> 00:10.470
And this is again a very simple, dynamic programming thing, just that we have a new term here, which

00:10.470 --> 00:17.280
is bit musk before moving on to bit Musk, which is made up of a bit less musk.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.500
So we all know the meaning of musk.

00:19.500 --> 00:23.160
Musk means which is hiding something inside your trade and a bit less.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.970
We all know what a -- it will be.

00:26.010 --> 00:28.110
It will be hiding something inside them.

00:28.530 --> 00:33.870
So that's why the term is bit musk but before moving on to bit Musk and what is what does it mean and

00:33.870 --> 00:34.530
how to use it.

00:34.890 --> 00:39.180
We will simply see we will see some big manipulation basics.

00:39.600 --> 00:39.840
Right.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.030
So we have I have very small.

00:43.300 --> 00:44.650
I'm not small.

00:44.650 --> 00:52.690
I have these simple topics which are generates upsets that checking whether certain or getting a bit

00:52.690 --> 00:55.090
or inserting arbitrate some very big manipulation.

00:56.140 --> 00:59.020
Firstly, let's talk about any number.

00:59.050 --> 00:59.740
Let's say the two.

00:59.770 --> 01:01.620
We have done so.

01:03.330 --> 01:07.710
Well, if I talk about binary, this represents to correct but in decimal distant.

01:08.130 --> 01:15.660
If I write ten as this binary number, then what I have is let's start from the rightmost Edward and

01:15.810 --> 01:18.750
we'll have zero because it's, it's an even number.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.870
Then we're going to have one which is eight plus two basically.

01:21.870 --> 01:22.170
Right.

01:22.740 --> 01:26.910
This is what we have tended to basically standard in due time.

01:26.910 --> 01:28.290
So it's a binary form of ten.

01:29.640 --> 01:29.940
So.

01:31.350 --> 01:35.520
What I'll do is I'll simultaneous recorded as well and I will see all these things.

01:35.550 --> 01:39.510
These are very basic word manipulation, but if you want to ignore them, you can.

01:39.870 --> 01:43.890
If you already know how to do these things right or.

01:45.460 --> 01:47.500
So let me have a bit said initially.

01:47.500 --> 01:53.290
Let's say I have a bit Dublin ten E and let's pass 14.

01:53.290 --> 01:54.190
Do it later.

01:54.190 --> 01:55.240
Let me see out it.

02:01.260 --> 02:08.610
So this is the bit this is the binary representation of 14, which is eight plus four plus two.

02:09.010 --> 02:12.390
So this is somewhat one of the easiest ways to convert any number to binary.

02:12.390 --> 02:17.850
Just take a picture of some particular length and just parsed in a model you want to set.

02:17.910 --> 02:20.670
Like, let's say let's, let's take 31 and.

02:23.270 --> 02:24.530
So this is 31.

02:24.950 --> 02:25.330
Let's talk.

02:25.940 --> 02:27.280
What if I bust minus two?

02:27.410 --> 02:27.980
Minus one?

02:28.160 --> 02:30.290
This is the bad representation of minus one.

02:30.650 --> 02:31.550
What about minus two?

02:32.830 --> 02:35.330
Well, we'll also talk about some negative numbers also.

02:35.350 --> 02:39.910
But before moving on to negative numbers, we just discussed a few things about positive numbers.

02:42.510 --> 02:42.680
It.

02:43.640 --> 02:46.070
So the first thing is we have to generate subsets.

02:46.280 --> 02:52.130
So let's say I want to I have these three items which is there to ABC and I want to generate all of

02:52.130 --> 02:54.160
its subsets with ABC eight.

02:54.170 --> 02:55.850
So how can I generate this object?

02:56.420 --> 02:56.870
It's.

02:58.210 --> 02:59.250
So how many subjects are there?

02:59.250 --> 03:00.510
Firstly, we have three elements.

03:00.510 --> 03:05.040
B So we'll have to strip our the subset eight that is a subset.

03:05.430 --> 03:12.990
So what I'll do is I'll start writing the numbers from 0 to 7 because 027 numbers will have three bits.

03:12.990 --> 03:16.980
I like the three bits and we'll see the magic that it does.

03:17.550 --> 03:24.330
I have 01234567 and it is a binary of 02041.

03:24.330 --> 03:24.900
It is one.

03:25.860 --> 03:26.220
Who?

03:27.170 --> 03:27.530
The.

03:29.990 --> 03:30.440
Five.

03:31.430 --> 03:32.450
Six and seven.

03:32.690 --> 03:32.960
Eight.

03:33.140 --> 03:37.340
So as you can see, we have all different combinations in these binaries of zeros and ones.

03:37.730 --> 03:38.150
Correct.

03:38.150 --> 03:41.000
Because we had three places and we have building all of them.

03:41.780 --> 03:43.880
So now what I do is just map.

03:43.880 --> 03:44.650
I'll map E.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.450
I just take these.

03:48.020 --> 03:48.770
Let me try to do.

03:49.720 --> 03:50.300
It's just.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.180
I'll just map.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.360
These is wherever I get one.

03:54.370 --> 03:55.210
I'll mab dc.

03:55.210 --> 03:57.070
Where will I get one before zero?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.750
We can see all these trees at zero.

03:58.750 --> 04:02.830
That means I will not include at the rate now be noisy, but it's an empty set.

04:04.210 --> 04:08.950
This one represents C, this will represent B, this will represent b c in this field represent E,

04:09.010 --> 04:12.250
this will represent AC, A, B and C.

04:12.610 --> 04:16.810
So here you can see I have generated all possible subsets of a particular.

04:19.230 --> 04:19.560
Right.

04:19.810 --> 04:21.790
A particular element.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.480
And what if there are four elements?

04:24.780 --> 04:26.310
If there were four elements, let's see.

04:26.310 --> 04:29.280
If I had D also, then I would have to write.

04:31.260 --> 04:34.800
If they were for numbers, then I would take all these numbers.

04:35.100 --> 04:41.790
And, you know, I tried it from zero to 0 to 15 because then we'll get all possible subsets.

04:42.330 --> 04:46.440
For example, if I had de here, I'll have eight, nine, ten, 11 and so on.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.260
And we can repeat the same process.

04:49.860 --> 04:51.260
Well, I'll, I'll talk later.

04:51.270 --> 04:57.780
But before moving there, let's see the second part, which is it can be disturbed or not.

04:58.110 --> 05:02.520
So if I have a binary representation of 11011.

05:02.560 --> 05:02.840
Okay.

05:02.850 --> 05:11.280
So generally we start from the most this is the most significant bit that is the left most divide is

05:11.280 --> 05:15.390
called the significant bit because this represents doing this to the power of six, which is a huge

05:15.390 --> 05:16.350
number eight.

05:16.710 --> 05:20.940
And these these bits and it's a this it represents two listed above one only.

05:22.590 --> 05:25.800
So here we can see this is a particular binary representation of a number.

05:25.800 --> 05:26.520
You can derive them.

05:27.680 --> 05:34.340
And I want to set up a link to this bit zero rate.

05:34.730 --> 05:41.120
This bit is the second, but I want to set second rate, so let's just sit back and read the horror

05:41.120 --> 05:42.860
set as I can read for any number.

05:43.130 --> 05:49.490
What I will simply do is I have this ability x then what I see, I see x and.

05:50.600 --> 05:58.520
If I dig in order of 001008, if I take an order of this number with the above number, then I can simply

05:58.520 --> 06:00.530
get the rate set.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.870
Correct me if I did.

06:03.730 --> 06:03.810
Hmm.

06:05.480 --> 06:10.730
What we'll do is we'll do nothing, but we'll just take all of these to number three.

06:10.910 --> 06:16.370
So I want to set this I can, which I'll just take a number which represents which is on this.

06:16.370 --> 06:17.110
I can read it.

06:17.390 --> 06:18.680
Then I'll take all of them.

06:19.520 --> 06:25.700
And here we can see that I have this number, which it's the same number with this converts it.

06:26.270 --> 06:26.570
Correct.

06:26.840 --> 06:31.160
So X or we can save one left shift.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.490
Names because I wanted to set second rate.

06:34.730 --> 06:36.230
What is one left of two Dems?

06:36.560 --> 06:38.630
You almost know left shifting.

06:39.530 --> 06:42.920
This is again a op ed which is lecture eight.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.530
So this lecture doctorate is very simple.

06:45.770 --> 06:52.790
For example, if I have this right and I won't allow time left shifting it funding what is a left shift

06:52.790 --> 06:57.350
lecture means all the bits which have left and on the 020 will complete.

06:57.830 --> 06:58.730
The zero comes here.

06:58.760 --> 06:59.630
This one comes here.

06:59.630 --> 07:00.290
One comes here.

07:00.290 --> 07:00.920
One comes here.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.580
So the I'm shifting them one time not to the state.

07:04.580 --> 07:04.750
No.

07:05.090 --> 07:06.830
Eight performing one left shift.

07:07.370 --> 07:10.340
This is the new representation and I left A0 with eight.

07:10.790 --> 07:19.450
So if I see a left shift one time the same as in 2 to 8, you can check for any number.

07:19.460 --> 07:20.600
Eight for left shift.

07:20.810 --> 07:21.750
One will give me.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.180
You can take this this fort.

07:25.180 --> 07:27.130
If I left you at all the funding it will give me.

07:27.790 --> 07:30.860
And similarly, I have an operation called Write Shoot and this.

07:30.860 --> 07:32.380
And I should really just write each of the.

07:32.590 --> 07:34.360
And last we will go over.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.510
So these are some left and right shift.

07:38.520 --> 07:42.120
And this is our view by taking all from one left shift two.

07:42.120 --> 07:46.200
So what is one left two one is represented as this right.

07:46.950 --> 07:51.390
And if I left shifted two times, this one will come over here and rest.

07:51.420 --> 07:59.280
All will be zero one left shift two is nothing more to return the power to put it one left shift x is

07:59.280 --> 08:00.300
to erase to the power.

08:03.550 --> 08:03.850
Right.

08:04.390 --> 08:08.500
And so this was about setting of it and how can I answer it?

08:09.950 --> 08:11.480
And you think of it.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.550
How can I answer that?

08:13.550 --> 08:13.880
Easy.

08:15.140 --> 08:16.360
If I want to answer it.

08:18.280 --> 08:18.520
Yeah.

08:18.890 --> 08:19.060
Okay.

08:19.090 --> 08:20.730
I leave it to you how to interpret.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.200
So there are various multiple ways to check it.

08:23.560 --> 08:27.670
Now, the last one is check if I take if I it to be disturbed or not.

08:28.330 --> 08:30.760
If I want to check whether the I the British said or not.

08:30.830 --> 08:33.190
Let's see again, let's take the same example.

08:33.520 --> 08:37.580
And I want to check whether this which is a third with zero one, two, three, right.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.790
With it always in zero base or indexing.

08:40.030 --> 08:42.280
I want to check whether the third word is said or not.

08:42.640 --> 08:43.390
That or not.

08:43.810 --> 08:45.910
What I simply do is I'll write.

08:45.910 --> 08:49.150
I'll just make this bit come to the first place.

08:49.150 --> 08:50.470
That is the zeroth position.

08:50.650 --> 08:53.320
And for that, what I have to do is it is a third rate.

08:53.590 --> 08:56.590
If I write it three times, then what will happen?

08:56.590 --> 08:58.480
This will reach the first place.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.760
This will reach the second place.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.070
In third place and this default and the rest all will be zero.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.320
I have shifted the above.

09:08.550 --> 09:10.440
Bit of a -- three times.

09:10.830 --> 09:11.110
Correct.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.050
This is the new number that I got.

09:13.290 --> 09:15.540
And now we know this returns reached zero.

09:15.930 --> 09:19.230
So what I do is I just write a book called one.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.450
This is one date in binary.

09:21.450 --> 09:22.530
And I'll take that and.

09:24.150 --> 09:25.170
So when it didn't.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.880
Only if this British said.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.310
And then one in one will give me zero.

09:29.310 --> 09:32.190
And one in one will give me one at the end.

09:32.190 --> 09:34.740
All all the rest will be zero here.

09:35.760 --> 09:42.300
Well, by just digging and I want to check a bit, I just I shifted over to the antique and with one

09:42.600 --> 09:45.280
that in that way I can get with it a bit etc..

09:46.290 --> 09:46.610
Yeah.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.160
So what.

09:47.490 --> 09:50.760
So I have to check whether it's in VI intimate of exercised or not.

09:50.760 --> 09:54.330
I like shift x five times and with one.

09:56.090 --> 09:57.440
I hope this is clear.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.160
And, uh.

10:05.810 --> 10:07.400
Anything else is needed.

10:07.970 --> 10:08.300
Yeah.

10:08.690 --> 10:09.470
Now leave.

10:09.470 --> 10:11.300
I leave the unsettling of Bill to you.

10:12.800 --> 10:13.280
And.

10:15.440 --> 10:15.830
Correct.

10:16.010 --> 10:17.780
So anything else?

10:17.780 --> 10:18.200
You.

10:19.160 --> 10:19.430
No.

10:19.700 --> 10:22.270
And let's go to these things very quickly.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.120
If I.

10:26.770 --> 10:31.810
Or what we can do is okay, let's call it very quickly the legend that all these objects.

10:34.060 --> 10:39.820
Let's say I was doing this and which is nothing but A, B, C, and I would want to generate all these

10:39.820 --> 10:42.090
subsets of it a little bit.

10:42.130 --> 10:45.700
And it is absurd what I have to do, I have to run over for.

10:46.730 --> 10:50.450
I'll start from zero, and it will go till one left shift.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.850
Mm hmm.

10:53.510 --> 10:56.420
When they observed this as ordered, size eight.

10:56.810 --> 11:00.530
So let's dig in and let's call it as stasis.

11:02.310 --> 11:04.920
Will it will go for two days to the power three.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.590
So there is one olive tree, which is one lecture template.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.380
So I will go from 0 to 7 in this case.

11:11.070 --> 11:16.500
And now for all these I's, what I'll do is I'll just check whether.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.290
They're British said they're not.

11:19.300 --> 11:22.600
If they're that British said, I simply include it.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.420
If it is not, it originally excluded from my site.

11:26.410 --> 11:29.470
So do you start from zero and you will go to plan only because it's three.

11:29.740 --> 11:36.430
I just have to check the three bids and let six if I get there to be disabled or not.

11:36.610 --> 11:38.360
And how can we take that either?

11:38.410 --> 11:40.030
TVG And when?

11:41.100 --> 11:44.670
In this way, we can check whether I get rid of ice or not.

11:45.030 --> 11:49.670
And if it is set, I just print the out as G.

11:50.460 --> 11:50.790
Correct.

11:51.270 --> 11:53.670
Otherwise I won't print anything.

11:53.670 --> 11:55.860
And then we can just put in the new name.

11:57.790 --> 11:57.970
Here.

11:57.970 --> 12:03.220
You can see I've done it at all possible jobs at AB, CHC and ABC.

12:03.490 --> 12:09.070
Similarly, if I had a d, e, let's say d, e f, then I'll do this with about six episodes, which

12:09.070 --> 12:09.730
is 64.

12:09.910 --> 12:14.440
And here we can see all these opposite two very different ways of generating subsets.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.210
This is one big manipulation.

12:17.260 --> 12:21.610
And so in this what we saw, we saw taking it a bit.

12:22.580 --> 12:26.590
Now let's check whether a Buddhist said or not.

12:26.720 --> 12:27.710
So let's call em.

12:27.710 --> 12:29.510
And let's see em as equals to.

12:31.550 --> 12:32.670
Ten eight.

12:33.180 --> 12:33.500
Let's.

12:34.990 --> 12:35.400
That.

12:36.650 --> 12:41.370
So in ten zero 1/1 readers already said, let's get this second.

12:42.390 --> 12:43.410
It's checking.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.050
Bit off.

12:47.150 --> 12:49.220
So how can I say I can rid of him?

12:49.610 --> 12:50.000
Okay.

12:50.090 --> 12:51.170
We don't need a follow up.

12:51.770 --> 12:52.010
Yeah.

12:52.010 --> 12:53.750
So I'll simply say m is nothing but.

12:56.230 --> 12:56.690
Is it?

12:57.940 --> 13:00.130
I simply say that am is nothing but an.

13:02.720 --> 13:06.650
M or one left shift two.

13:06.750 --> 13:10.400
I've shifted one two times and our rhythm and we'll just started.

13:10.820 --> 13:13.220
What if the second rate of M was already there then?

13:13.220 --> 13:19.460
Also, we won't have any problem late because I'm taking out one or one is also one and zero or one

13:19.460 --> 13:20.870
is also in it.

13:21.080 --> 13:25.550
And finally, let's put in them or what I guess, what's the value of them?

13:26.580 --> 13:30.840
I've started the second trade, so it will be eight plus four.

13:31.410 --> 13:32.460
Let's do this.

13:33.180 --> 13:33.510
14.

13:33.990 --> 13:35.730
As you can see, we have d 14.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.430
Similarly, you can enter the bid and.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.120
You the think so, too.

13:41.140 --> 13:43.320
These are some very basics of brain manipulation.

13:44.670 --> 13:47.490
Then the next part, we'll start with our deep with bitmaps.
