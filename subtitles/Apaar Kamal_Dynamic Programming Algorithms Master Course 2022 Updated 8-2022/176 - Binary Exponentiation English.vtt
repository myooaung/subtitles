00:00.650 --> 00:01.580
Welcome, everyone.

00:01.610 --> 00:04.790
So in this section we will understand what is exponential.

00:05.690 --> 00:09.460
How does x one intuition work and why do we need it?

00:09.980 --> 00:11.870
First of all, let us see what is exponential.

00:12.260 --> 00:19.190
Again, it's a very simple mathematical formula, and that is if I multiply a B times.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.380
And I did it with the power.

00:23.190 --> 00:23.850
This is normal.

00:23.860 --> 00:24.470
Exponential.

00:25.010 --> 00:26.370
So be the next one.

00:26.370 --> 00:26.900
End of it.

00:27.390 --> 00:27.780
And.

00:29.170 --> 00:34.150
This is basically the number of times is be right no base for school.

00:34.540 --> 00:37.190
So if I say is two and B is four.

00:37.550 --> 00:41.950
But I don't see any indication these were still through to the power four will give me.

00:43.090 --> 00:44.300
16 eight.

00:45.460 --> 00:46.930
So this is excluding Egyptian.

00:46.930 --> 00:51.250
We all know this that if I want to multiply or turn B times, we get this.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.500
So that's not what this lecture is about.

00:54.520 --> 01:02.500
It is about how to find an optimal solution to finding and to finding the best complexity of X for an

01:02.500 --> 01:02.880
intuition.

01:03.600 --> 01:09.460
If I want to find out the best best complexity of X for an injection that okay, find me it to the power

01:09.460 --> 01:11.330
being very, very optimal time.

01:11.810 --> 01:12.910
What are the best you can do?

01:13.510 --> 01:19.420
The first approach is very simple that okay, I can simply multiply ab times.

01:20.980 --> 01:21.280
Eight.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.310
But what's the total complexity of this?

01:23.320 --> 01:28.590
If I multiply every times by using a for a loop, it will be all of B eight.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.550
But that is not the complexity we want.

01:31.000 --> 01:39.490
We want it to be better than what we have or will do is we will seek help of binary functions eight

01:39.790 --> 01:41.980
and we will call it binary exponential.

01:42.070 --> 01:43.210
You will.

01:44.190 --> 01:50.760
This will be very, very handy, guys, believe me or not, in most of those of problems in which we

01:50.760 --> 01:56.490
use mathematical expressions, in which like, let's say there's an elegant solution which is being

01:56.490 --> 02:02.670
solved and that reconciliation is being like there's finally a formula that is coming up for a particular

02:02.670 --> 02:09.780
end, let's say N squared minus two, n plus one or and the power sum M minus something plus something.

02:09.780 --> 02:10.340
And it doesn't.

02:11.420 --> 02:17.750
So whenever there's a formula on generally we have some exponents, we have some of variables in there,

02:17.760 --> 02:22.910
we have some constraints and some explaining how to solve those exponents in really very listing.

02:23.540 --> 02:30.390
So right now we are looking at binary exponents and after this we'll be looking at Model X funding.

02:31.480 --> 02:34.590
Well, then that will only require by an exponential.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.080
But still.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.160
Now let's move ahead with binary exponential.

02:40.730 --> 02:43.150
And let's take an example.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.480
So it's a very easy topic.

02:44.510 --> 02:47.650
It's not a big deal and a very short code for this to wait.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.120
So it won't take like more than 2 minutes.

02:51.080 --> 02:54.500
But yeah, let's say I want to find out to the power ten.

02:55.980 --> 03:02.190
Well, what we do is we take the exponent and and write it in in binding numbers and we know exponent

03:02.190 --> 03:06.180
is this then if divided into bind, it is written as 1010.

03:07.500 --> 03:07.790
Eight.

03:08.490 --> 03:13.860
If this band is written as 100108 means eight +28.

03:13.860 --> 03:19.170
So what does it plus two means that yes, I divided the standard to binary eight.

03:20.380 --> 03:20.830
So.

03:24.410 --> 03:24.650
Well.

03:25.960 --> 03:30.430
So now let's see how it is by the exponential work rate right now where Delta is.

03:30.430 --> 03:39.660
I'll take A, I'll take B and I will take another dump called resulting in result.

03:39.730 --> 03:43.360
And what I'll do is I'll keep on multiplying in some specific locations.

03:43.460 --> 03:44.620
So just see this.

03:44.920 --> 03:52.720
Initially, what happens is is equal to two B's equals to ten and resultant is equal to one eight.

03:52.790 --> 03:57.930
Because if I'm, I want to multiply something two resulting in one sum of answers.

03:57.940 --> 04:00.790
So I should take one as the result in value, not zero.

04:00.790 --> 04:05.680
Because if I multiply, ending with 000 is like a black hole, right?

04:05.770 --> 04:09.760
You do anything with it, it will just absorb that thing and make it zero.

04:12.310 --> 04:12.610
Yeah.

04:12.820 --> 04:18.460
So in the first step, what we'll do is okay, so right now like being binary for all to be binary or

04:18.460 --> 04:18.760
very.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.830
So there are some steps that we need to follow.

04:22.890 --> 04:24.870
The first step is very simple.

04:26.190 --> 04:26.530
That.

04:28.070 --> 04:31.640
Check if we last check.

04:38.670 --> 04:44.530
Rate of fee is set eight ways.

04:44.610 --> 04:50.890
If the last last said last bit of be said night notice not set then what we'll do is will simply say

04:50.890 --> 04:52.560
it is a will simply multiply.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.050
He's returning to it.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.190
So I'm just not giving you a algorithm here.

04:57.210 --> 05:04.380
I'm just not giving you a writing opportunity about and also explain you like how did it come before

05:04.440 --> 05:04.520
it?

05:04.520 --> 05:09.450
Before moving on to that, I just simply write to do the power that can be written is to devolve into

05:09.450 --> 05:10.980
truly the power to it.

05:11.430 --> 05:17.160
This is the whole point is that we will simply divide those powers and multiply them.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.490
And I if I multiply to do the power to the to.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.960
This will give me to the depravity plus two.

05:21.960 --> 05:22.380
Which is.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.070
Through the power.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.750
And this is a normal fundraiser.

05:26.770 --> 05:29.810
Now, the main idea behind binary X1 intuition.

05:30.460 --> 05:30.580
Right.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.990
And how is that being done?

05:31.990 --> 05:32.220
That.

05:32.440 --> 05:34.810
I'll simply show you where they go.

05:35.760 --> 05:40.230
Well, before moving on to the algorithm, let let's take this quick example.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.690
So we have 1010 here.

05:43.050 --> 05:43.740
What I do is.

05:44.700 --> 05:47.570
Zero one, two and three at eight.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.040
If I did, I was off to what?

05:50.100 --> 05:51.690
I'll get to devour zero.

05:52.410 --> 05:56.300
To devour one, to do the power to and to do the power three h.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.360
I won't do for it.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.460
I've just written to lose powers over here.

06:00.210 --> 06:01.470
These are two his powers.

06:02.670 --> 06:04.320
And this is binary often.

06:04.860 --> 06:07.810
And these are just indexes of my pitch.

06:08.090 --> 06:09.450
EDWARDS Okay.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.030
Now what I need to do is simple.

06:12.450 --> 06:14.700
So here I'll get to the deeper one.

06:14.700 --> 06:15.330
Initially red.

06:15.330 --> 06:17.100
Right now my is to the deep blue.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.090
And so this will be.

06:19.110 --> 06:25.740
Then to do the power to do the the power forward and to the the poverty rate is the simple thing to

06:25.740 --> 06:32.330
notice is that if I have one, as I said, then I'll simply include these two values into my resultant.

06:32.520 --> 06:37.670
Simply multiply these two values into my resulting aid to the returning to the power rate.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.140
Integrity by forward is equal to resultant.

06:40.410 --> 06:41.790
And this will become.

06:43.190 --> 06:46.520
To study due to the power this will become.

06:46.520 --> 06:50.150
To read about it in is not a big deal.

06:50.680 --> 06:50.890
Okay.

06:50.900 --> 06:51.700
So this is not true.

06:51.710 --> 06:52.400
This is a.

06:53.910 --> 06:55.580
That's what we are going to do.

06:55.830 --> 07:00.780
So for another example, let's say I want to find out who did power or didn't.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.640
So it is eight plus six.

07:02.640 --> 07:03.300
Six is for.

07:03.300 --> 07:04.680
Bless you, Rachel.

07:04.740 --> 07:06.640
This is voting for this.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.290
How can I write to deliver 14 in binary form?

07:09.300 --> 07:13.320
It becomes simple through delivery to this power forward and the power to.

07:13.590 --> 07:14.960
So I form these three terms.

07:14.970 --> 07:16.880
How do I find these three two terms?

07:16.890 --> 07:17.490
Very easy.

07:18.030 --> 07:19.860
I initially I have two ways.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.470
If I square it, it becomes two squared.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.810
If I squared it, it becomes ready by four.

07:25.170 --> 07:27.650
If I squared it, it becomes too divided.

07:28.140 --> 07:34.020
If I squared it, it becomes about 16, about 32 to the power of 64.

07:34.020 --> 07:40.320
And so on day two, whatever I'll have at that moment after one iteration where notice is equal to into

07:40.320 --> 07:41.340
it, that is a squared.

07:42.790 --> 07:43.390
Simple as that.

07:44.140 --> 07:45.700
So that's what we are going to.

07:46.720 --> 07:52.810
Do over here there take a loss Edward of the I or know if it is said what does it mean in the loss said

07:52.810 --> 07:55.990
British said simply include it multiply.

07:58.550 --> 08:04.310
E into resultant nature simply multiply in the resultant not a big deal.

08:04.960 --> 08:08.600
Eight And if the bird is not yet, no problem.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.130
What is the second step?

08:10.160 --> 08:16.040
No problem if it is not simply right to be right because I am always taking the last step.

08:16.730 --> 08:22.430
So if B is 1010 initially in the next iteration, B will be 0101.

08:22.430 --> 08:29.780
In the next iteration, B will be 0010 next iteration 0001 in the next iteration zero m right.

08:29.780 --> 08:30.620
Shifting be right.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.760
What does negative mean?

08:31.760 --> 08:33.330
Just shift the bit rightward?

08:34.080 --> 08:36.230
Well, because I want to check all these.

08:37.380 --> 08:40.110
A bit of be right.

08:40.200 --> 08:45.270
And while I am like shifting B ratings to negative B.

08:49.420 --> 08:52.930
And if I'm shifting B so.

08:53.820 --> 08:54.810
What is the third step?

08:55.230 --> 08:59.010
Both at the same time, I have to say, is equal to a square rate.

08:59.340 --> 09:08.580
I have to keep on multiplying it eight days so it will become loaded above it for here to devour it

09:08.790 --> 09:09.570
due to the power.

09:09.630 --> 09:10.430
16.

09:16.900 --> 09:20.470
It will become too squared with, above all, to the beverage and to the devour.

09:21.550 --> 09:26.860
So if the last word is said, then what I'll do is I'll simply multiply it into the resultant word.

09:26.860 --> 09:31.150
I'll multiply and multiply into the resultant eight, whatever that is.

09:31.150 --> 09:35.980
The return value I have, if I multiply into the written word I'll get is true square.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.230
Then again, let's move to the third step.

09:38.740 --> 09:39.610
This is the third step.

09:39.610 --> 09:43.150
Here is the last bit of said no.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.830
If it is not there, do nothing right.

09:45.310 --> 09:51.040
The resultant is still two square and then move to do it through deliberate.

09:51.040 --> 09:56.980
And what happens here is if just say glass it Glastonbury said yes or to stay there then simply multiply

09:56.980 --> 10:01.030
into resultant so it becomes duty bound to win due to the deposit it.

10:01.270 --> 10:04.060
And then finally what we have is b it becomes zero.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.270
So if we become zero, what does it mean?

10:09.540 --> 10:14.880
That we don't have to get you in for the calculations because anything to the power zero is zero.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.010
So I don't have to calculate anything else.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.240
So here, I'll break.

10:18.510 --> 10:19.910
What is the result in that regard?

10:19.910 --> 10:20.940
Because it is due to the power.

10:21.620 --> 10:26.510
And so, of course, you can apply it for Lupin.

10:26.520 --> 10:30.210
Check that if the British multiplied, if not, continue forward.

10:30.420 --> 10:35.540
And I'd be using a by loop because the code becomes really easy to code eight.

10:35.820 --> 10:36.870
But it is quickly.

10:38.660 --> 10:39.420
No this part.

10:39.770 --> 10:42.620
After this, we'll move on to model exponential.

10:42.620 --> 10:42.680
Interesting.

10:42.920 --> 10:46.990
And that's also an interesting part and very easy part.

10:47.000 --> 10:47.280
Right.

10:47.300 --> 10:47.630
So.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.610
Let's call this function power.

10:52.360 --> 10:52.500
Okay.

10:52.630 --> 10:54.910
So this returns me to the power to be.

10:55.470 --> 11:01.360
What I have is I degreaser turned in easily and there didn't should be one who will be who until y is

11:01.360 --> 11:02.110
greater than zero.

11:02.140 --> 11:03.190
What I'll do is simple.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.990
I'll take the last bit.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.760
So if being one, that means.

11:08.150 --> 11:09.530
The last bit of said.

11:09.590 --> 11:14.300
So if you are not clear with all this manipulation and the Nord and other things and simply watch out

11:14.300 --> 11:14.820
the number two.

11:15.770 --> 11:17.200
These are the basics, right?

11:17.900 --> 11:23.480
What I would say is these are individuals to simply multiply in the resulting otherwise, whether it

11:23.480 --> 11:30.590
be said or not, I simply say is it goes to Esquire, then multiplying into A and B slash you go straight

11:30.590 --> 11:32.500
to it means I'm right.

11:32.540 --> 11:33.500
Shifting B right.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.370
So you can do it.

11:34.370 --> 11:37.010
This will also be right shift two times.

11:37.010 --> 11:38.180
Or you can divide it by.

11:39.150 --> 11:40.500
Let it be nature, for one thing.

11:40.590 --> 11:41.070
All you can do.

11:41.070 --> 11:43.350
I'd be where to look if I divided by two.

11:43.350 --> 11:43.770
It is.

11:45.230 --> 11:49.040
But I would be one thing if I do, I multiply by two.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.940
It becomes less should be one eight.

11:51.950 --> 11:55.580
So these are small, small breaks that you should know.

11:55.950 --> 11:59.690
Finally, what I'll do is I'll trade under nothing more to do, just knits.

11:59.690 --> 12:00.320
But in this.

12:02.150 --> 12:02.410
Yeah.

12:02.420 --> 12:03.950
So let's stick to ending.

12:06.940 --> 12:09.060
We got 1020 foot rate.

12:09.430 --> 12:16.090
If you want to check, if you want to print out all these things, you can take like directly out whatever

12:16.090 --> 12:17.390
stuff you want to and check.

12:17.410 --> 12:18.580
How is it working at eight?

12:18.940 --> 12:21.040
But if I do, it is about 20.

12:21.190 --> 12:22.030
It's very simple.

12:22.550 --> 12:29.290
I'll get the perfect answer because there we have used binary in the work because by have we use binding

12:29.290 --> 12:30.190
to work because.

12:32.300 --> 12:32.900
If I died.

12:33.170 --> 12:37.040
If I did be as in binary and there to be approximately.

12:38.510 --> 12:40.190
Ten to the power 18.

12:41.120 --> 12:41.420
Eight.

12:42.050 --> 12:44.960
If I if I multiply if I find out this term.

12:45.870 --> 12:46.650
Well, let me.

12:47.820 --> 12:53.520
If I say into power we will be approximately and the power it.

12:54.660 --> 12:57.030
Then I cannot find out this value.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.230
It will be too huge.

12:58.650 --> 13:00.540
Before that I have more model an just.

13:00.660 --> 13:01.560
Do not worry about that.

13:02.460 --> 13:06.680
The second thing is that okay, I do not have a machine.

13:07.440 --> 13:12.750
That probability of calculating this if we stand about 18 because it will take a lot of time.

13:13.170 --> 13:19.790
So in 1/2 for like an average and once again I can calculate ten to the power, seven steps, eight.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.640
So how many seconds will be required to calculate time to the power rating iterations?

13:23.940 --> 13:26.970
It will be turned into the power 11 seconds.

13:27.570 --> 13:30.360
I guess that is nearly equal to life of art.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.490
It's too huge.

13:33.330 --> 13:33.690
So.

13:35.550 --> 13:39.530
So what we'll do is simply we will simply convert this number into binary.

13:39.540 --> 13:44.750
So in binary it's land will be at most 64 often land and liberating.

13:45.030 --> 13:51.820
And in only 64 operations, only 64 operations, we will simply find out either the power we will be

13:51.820 --> 13:52.400
is very huge.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.070
Always.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.880
You can check this out.

13:56.450 --> 13:57.950
So this vaccine off.

13:59.140 --> 14:00.790
Look, we.

14:01.790 --> 14:01.990
Eight.

14:02.480 --> 14:02.750
Why?

14:02.780 --> 14:06.500
Because we are always dividing by two in every step.

14:06.740 --> 14:08.510
So there will be a time when we will be zero.

14:08.810 --> 14:13.880
In how much time will be zero when the last when the first attribute of beat becomes a lassitude of

14:13.880 --> 14:14.690
being, it goes.

14:15.580 --> 14:16.510
Of it in V.

14:17.770 --> 14:18.020
Eight.

14:18.460 --> 14:23.380
So it's a very good complexity of log B because this power function.

14:24.640 --> 14:29.140
It will be used in many problems and many statements and it will also be used in many.

14:31.110 --> 14:32.400
Mathematical sections.

14:32.850 --> 14:33.130
Eight.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.570
It will also be used to calculate NCR.

14:36.600 --> 14:40.950
It will be used to calculate inverse of a number using mild many things.

14:40.950 --> 14:48.270
Right after this guys will discuss about a snippet and it's stupid as but will be very useful to all

14:48.630 --> 14:48.890
eight.

14:48.930 --> 14:52.190
So we will discuss it and this is just a part of it, right?

14:52.640 --> 14:58.180
Next section will discuss about modular exponential rate, not up to 5 minutes.

14:58.180 --> 15:00.660
So we'll think of ways.
