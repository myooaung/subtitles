WEBVTT

00:00.810 --> 00:01.230
I will.

00:01.830 --> 00:05.040
So we have already seen this problem called super blue.

00:05.040 --> 00:06.420
And it was a handkerchief.

00:06.720 --> 00:10.050
It was one of the first problems that we discussed in this course in one day.

00:10.050 --> 00:14.280
They believed that because of religion, that regarding the problem was simple.

00:14.280 --> 00:18.510
That was the deep nothing but minimum of previous three deep values.

00:18.930 --> 00:19.230
Right.

00:19.290 --> 00:21.380
Minus one I went to and I must replace it.

00:22.410 --> 00:24.570
But in the problem it said that.

00:26.300 --> 00:27.980
No one can go three days in a row.

00:27.980 --> 00:28.310
Right?

00:28.730 --> 00:31.250
I've written assembled skills here and.

00:33.370 --> 00:37.690
We cannot take like, you know, the well we can.

00:38.890 --> 00:42.700
We have to take at least one element from every driver in the race.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.530
So in this case, what was the answer?

00:44.620 --> 00:48.100
This ain't that is so that No.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.180
Three windows empty.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.630
It would be a big Lisbon anyway, and the sum of them is minimum.

00:53.380 --> 00:58.750
So by applying the above dynamic programming recursion recursive relation, we already saw that.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.790
We got the answer that for you.

01:01.510 --> 01:03.340
I hope you know the problem because.

01:04.530 --> 01:05.970
One of the first problems we discussed.

01:07.140 --> 01:12.490
But now let's let's just see what what if the problem gives another variable called key aid?

01:12.750 --> 01:19.680
And he says the problem is that now you cannot go you cannot go for k k days in a row.

01:20.250 --> 01:24.420
So instead of three, I'm saying these are really called k the gig n before.

01:24.840 --> 01:31.290
But if ks forward is a reconsideration because the relation is nothing but this which is API minus one.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.120
API minus two.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.520
The API ministry.

01:37.770 --> 01:38.640
Repayment is for.

01:40.550 --> 01:41.380
Great pleasure.

01:43.000 --> 01:43.310
Correct.

01:43.690 --> 01:44.470
What does this mean?

01:45.480 --> 01:50.100
That cannot go four days in a row than from the previous four values.

01:50.100 --> 01:54.870
Just you can attach the content really after it goes and we can find out the answer.

01:54.900 --> 01:58.470
Eight But if it is five then we'll have one text over here.

01:58.470 --> 02:03.280
It will really be I mean -48, but so what if it's okay.

02:03.300 --> 02:03.810
So it will.

02:03.960 --> 02:04.860
It is from deep.

02:04.860 --> 02:06.410
I mean, minus one 2 minutes.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.660
So if I want to generalize it, I can write it as like this.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.070
And it is minimum of.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.000
AP i.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.310
And allegedly they'd.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.510
And this day.

02:19.930 --> 02:20.980
The day goes for.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.640
But I did like this then.

02:26.700 --> 02:27.450
A-minus.

02:27.900 --> 02:28.230
Good.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.840
And this day goes from 1 to 3.

02:30.870 --> 02:31.560
It goes to key.

02:32.520 --> 02:32.850
Right.

02:33.270 --> 02:36.290
So in this way, we will get because of religion that we want.

02:36.780 --> 02:39.890
But then how will you calculate this minimum wage?

02:39.900 --> 02:41.270
So what does this minimum means?

02:41.280 --> 02:44.850
That means the minimum of previous skill values.

02:45.150 --> 02:45.540
Correct.

02:46.270 --> 02:50.580
So if I want to find out the minimum of previous skill values and I want to do it in a.

02:51.630 --> 02:55.590
FOSTER We're not just, you know, iterating of our loop for all.

02:56.430 --> 03:01.050
So if I want to do a brute force in this case, then the what will be the brute force highly trained

03:01.050 --> 03:05.070
over all the AI is in for every AI literate back here times eight.

03:05.160 --> 03:10.260
So the guardian complexity of this solution would become an indicator that's whatever index I'm moving

03:10.260 --> 03:11.160
cadence back.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.660
But I don't want to move Cadence back.

03:14.490 --> 03:15.990
I want to optimize it for that.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.820
I want to do it in a better in complexity.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.770
And I want the minimum of.

03:20.730 --> 03:28.170
Minimum of I minus one index, still a minus key, and I want the minimum of the deep values that are

03:28.560 --> 03:28.890
found.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.660
And then how can I do this?

03:32.580 --> 03:32.880
Yeah.

03:32.910 --> 03:38.430
So for this what about we can do is we can use some data structures which gives me a minimum for a particular

03:38.430 --> 03:38.790
range.

03:39.030 --> 03:45.420
For example, segmenting a segment gives me the minimum for a particular range, looking for my minus

03:45.420 --> 03:49.950
one time and it will give me a minimum in that range in this log of.

03:51.140 --> 03:51.470
And.

03:52.420 --> 03:53.140
There's a lot of it.

03:53.390 --> 03:58.640
And whenever I find a new value that is, let's say DPA, what I'll do is I'll simply updated integrity,

03:58.910 --> 04:05.240
because if I find out that I found out that API value, I simply update it in the segment three because

04:05.360 --> 04:08.600
for a plus one I will be needing the minimum of previous gear again.

04:08.990 --> 04:09.160
Eight.

04:09.650 --> 04:13.750
What I'll do is I'll simply fill up the triple values for the first year values, which is nothing with

04:13.760 --> 04:15.410
the same as the base cases.

04:15.830 --> 04:22.130
Then I'll start a loop and then we can simply do one thing which is voiding the segments that give me

04:22.130 --> 04:23.570
the minimum from this to this.

04:23.720 --> 04:28.730
Whatever is the minimum plus here would be my current value and then I'll update that guarantee value

04:28.730 --> 04:33.470
in the segment so that it can be used for the calculation of the negative p value.

04:33.830 --> 04:34.120
Eight.

04:34.670 --> 04:41.270
So here what we can do is instead of and indicate I can optimize this by and into log in which is huge

04:41.840 --> 04:48.050
eight and in the log in is a well, we are reducing K2 log and which is very huge because let's see

04:48.050 --> 04:53.840
if case includes two in and any standard to power six so what is log of energy will be around 20 to

04:53.840 --> 05:01.010
8 so and so and into K will be ten is about 12 which won't ever work and otherwise it will be ten is

05:01.010 --> 05:05.660
about 16 to just 22, which is log log of an eight in the next part.

05:06.380 --> 05:11.390
Also before moving forward, what I'll say is if you do not know about these data structures, there

05:11.390 --> 05:15.970
is segment trees, family trees and sparse metrics and feel free to check out out of control.

05:15.970 --> 05:20.810
I mean, because in that we have these data sectors because I didn't know that these data structures

05:20.810 --> 05:25.040
in this current pose because it's totally based on dynamic programming rates.

05:25.040 --> 05:32.120
I don't did not want to know everything in this the string creates complexity so soon the next part

05:32.120 --> 05:34.250
and in the next word will code this problem.
