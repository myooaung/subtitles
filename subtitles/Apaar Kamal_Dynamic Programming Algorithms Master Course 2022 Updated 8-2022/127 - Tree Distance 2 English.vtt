WEBVTT

00:00.670 --> 00:01.090
I will.

00:01.570 --> 00:03.100
Let's do the followup problem.

00:03.700 --> 00:04.990
It's history of distances too.

00:05.500 --> 00:08.470
It is also very similar to the previous problem that we did.

00:08.920 --> 00:11.320
And this just we have to just find out each node.

00:11.920 --> 00:16.360
Your task is to add your domain for each node, the sum of the distance from the nodes to all the other

00:16.360 --> 00:16.630
nodes.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.740
Earlier we had Max, but now we have some.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.650
So there is not much change in this.

00:23.680 --> 00:31.100
But still, if you want to try it yourself, I would strongly suggest it because everything is seen.

00:31.330 --> 00:35.930
Just from this Max has been reduced to some odd.

00:35.950 --> 00:37.480
Max has been changed to some.

00:37.810 --> 00:39.040
Now you don't have to find mikes.

00:39.040 --> 00:39.970
You have to find some.

00:40.690 --> 00:46.290
If you solve this problem yourself, you can easily understand or you know, you can actually try yourself.

00:46.310 --> 00:51.580
Basically, you can understand, like how much of the previous problem have you actually understood?

00:53.250 --> 00:56.550
Because I wouldn't be explaining it in much detail.

00:56.580 --> 01:02.540
But we'll just quickly make the core changes that are required and even more than you think.

01:02.550 --> 01:02.790
Right.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.870
In this problem, what I'll do is we'll have a big cut in value.

01:07.470 --> 01:11.460
And in this decoding, in value, like the previous problem, had the maximum land rate.

01:11.670 --> 01:14.640
But now the decoding really will be nothing but the sum of.

01:16.110 --> 01:16.920
Distances.

01:20.230 --> 01:22.240
All nodes in subtree of current.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.410
In subtree of current.

01:26.960 --> 01:27.230
Right.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.060
So just one thing that we need to release.

01:29.270 --> 01:30.470
I do strongly.

01:30.950 --> 01:34.370
So the dispositive you're doing, write yourself and then come back.

01:35.630 --> 01:38.660
So the first thing that we need to understand is this.

01:38.660 --> 01:39.110
That.

01:41.690 --> 01:44.140
What is the distance?

01:44.360 --> 01:45.140
What is the Jaeger?

01:45.140 --> 01:47.450
And will your 40050?

01:47.480 --> 01:49.370
Because there is no distance in the supply of it.

01:49.760 --> 01:50.750
Now for three.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.990
What is the decoding value for Tre?

01:53.990 --> 01:57.130
That means what is the total sum of distances from all the notes?

01:57.650 --> 01:59.960
It is one from four and one from five.

01:59.960 --> 02:00.950
So basically two.

02:01.610 --> 02:02.720
What about this story?

02:02.720 --> 02:03.260
Two zero.

02:03.350 --> 02:04.310
And what about one?

02:05.000 --> 02:05.750
This is important.

02:06.050 --> 02:08.720
What about one of Venice?

02:09.170 --> 02:12.350
This part, which is one, two, two and bathroom.

02:12.350 --> 02:14.150
One, two, three is two.

02:15.110 --> 02:16.190
We have to include this also.

02:16.190 --> 02:17.420
See, it is not saying that.

02:17.750 --> 02:21.990
Tell me the maximum or tell me the sum of distances only from the leaf naught.

02:22.010 --> 02:22.640
It is telling.

02:22.850 --> 02:28.370
It is asking me to find out the sum of distances from all the nodes in the subtree of coordinate.

02:29.360 --> 02:34.340
The one to 3 to 4 is also one and one, two, three, two, five is also one.

02:34.610 --> 02:38.120
If I want to find it out recursively, what will be my definition of decoding?

02:39.270 --> 02:39.540
Here.

02:39.540 --> 02:45.430
You can easily see that if I figured out what is D3, that means the sum of distances from three to

02:45.450 --> 02:46.650
to all the other nodes.

02:47.400 --> 02:51.910
We just have to add one that means plus one to all those.

02:51.930 --> 02:55.650
But they not just, you know, it's not just two plus one.

02:55.950 --> 02:56.370
It is.

02:58.320 --> 03:05.400
The this distance plus one this distance plus one character is actually +28.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.860
And it is also this, which is one entry.

03:07.870 --> 03:09.330
So it is actually plus three.

03:09.330 --> 03:11.010
No, not even plus one.

03:11.010 --> 03:18.270
Not two, but plus three because we here we have to denote from three all the distances to each subtree

03:18.270 --> 03:19.380
must have been calculated.

03:19.380 --> 03:21.900
Let's, let's call it g of three.

03:22.410 --> 03:26.100
If I want to find out what is g of one, then how will I found a g of one?

03:26.520 --> 03:32.880
D over one is nothing but g of two, plus the number of nodes in the subtree of two.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.860
So let's go a little edge.

03:35.920 --> 03:42.190
Well, it's just another function called Askren, which is nothing but number of nodes, because for

03:42.190 --> 03:45.010
all those nodes, the part increased by one, right?

03:45.670 --> 03:46.810
So we just have to.

03:48.170 --> 03:55.640
We can just see like this that for and you know, let's say the current is nothing more or less one

03:55.640 --> 03:58.700
and two because this one lending this full ordinance rate.

03:58.700 --> 04:04.660
So it is one in two at ethics two, which is nothing more explicit ethics.

04:05.870 --> 04:10.940
Do you know some of the distances and isn't aware of not in the country of.

04:11.870 --> 04:12.190
Got it.

04:13.120 --> 04:13.640
Oh, yeah.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.560
Number of nodes in subtree.

04:19.670 --> 04:23.540
This was one thing that you would have noticed if you have not solved the problem yourself.

04:24.110 --> 04:27.290
And the second part is yeah.

04:27.320 --> 04:35.080
So this becomes Z2 plus x2 plus D three plus x38.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.880
So what is the duplex that you did with zero nine series one?

04:38.270 --> 04:42.530
And what is the three plus at three degrees two?

04:42.860 --> 04:46.400
And as three's three, it becomes 741.

04:47.210 --> 04:48.520
I hope we're going to see this later.

04:48.530 --> 04:54.400
This one plus one plus two +28.

04:54.440 --> 04:54.890
And.

04:56.550 --> 04:56.880
Yeah.

04:56.940 --> 04:57.300
So.

04:58.050 --> 04:59.210
Okay, so here we go again.

04:59.730 --> 05:01.020
I think I missed something.

05:01.020 --> 05:01.470
Maybe.

05:03.350 --> 05:03.640
Yeah.

05:03.710 --> 05:05.090
So it's not true.

05:05.330 --> 05:06.950
It's too late.

05:07.220 --> 05:08.950
The due date is two and three.

05:08.960 --> 05:09.210
Three.

05:09.230 --> 05:10.730
So it is one, three, six.

05:10.940 --> 05:14.030
So here we can see one plus one, one, one and one one.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.880
So all these are six, correct.

05:15.890 --> 05:22.030
So this is the first thing that you need to realize that this time decoding is nothing but summation

05:22.040 --> 05:24.200
of the explicit text.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.740
And we can easily find this talk.

05:27.070 --> 05:33.130
But in this in the same tutorial only I just change this function in which we are calculating g and

05:33.130 --> 05:41.830
it's also calculate each data in the same go only I just updating the g current is nothing but summation

05:41.830 --> 05:42.280
of.

05:45.130 --> 05:45.310
The.

05:47.130 --> 05:50.100
Plus at X and.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.100
Okay so for this we want to calculate that ticks also.

05:53.430 --> 05:53.710
Right.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.050
So what is its current?

05:55.860 --> 05:57.230
You know, very easy.

05:57.300 --> 06:06.510
It's get into that X plus one the number of nodes the subtree of its side less than the current node.

06:06.840 --> 06:15.720
Let's calculated over here the being here also at current is nothing but so many.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.380
These are being all in this room.

06:17.390 --> 06:21.240
Many one piece that's good and is nothing but six.

06:22.150 --> 06:26.400
And I'd simply say it's current plus equals to one.

06:27.390 --> 06:29.940
That means the end, including a career in disability.

06:31.470 --> 06:35.880
I hope this is being very clear.

06:36.940 --> 06:44.530
Well, look, buy this bike by using this DFC, which is this we have actually calculated the deaths

06:44.530 --> 06:44.950
in addicts.

06:44.950 --> 06:45.940
That is eight.

06:46.180 --> 06:49.210
Now, what we want is now we want to calculate the ethics values.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.840
Our insurgents if current.

06:52.510 --> 06:58.560
Again, the problem is divided into two parts and the current is coming from the parent node or it is

06:58.560 --> 07:01.710
coming from the subtree of current eight.

07:02.070 --> 07:03.180
Just like the previous problem.

07:03.870 --> 07:07.710
So if it is coming from the subtree of the current, then it is nothing but.

07:08.860 --> 07:12.630
Same thing, which is a mission of g x plus at six.

07:14.110 --> 07:14.410
Right.

07:14.960 --> 07:15.430
And.

07:18.360 --> 07:22.960
Or Yeah, we're going to do some of the explicit checks.

07:23.400 --> 07:27.260
It seems the devalues for the child's.

07:28.410 --> 07:28.710
So.

07:29.710 --> 07:30.440
We considered it.

07:30.460 --> 07:37.930
So yeah, I think we can say this, that it is the sum of all our decisions in the surprise of the jury.

07:37.930 --> 07:38.200
Not.

07:39.640 --> 07:40.060
And.

07:41.540 --> 07:42.110
Let's eat.

07:43.670 --> 07:46.490
And you know that this value's nothing but decadent.

07:47.270 --> 07:50.900
This is already calculated and stored here.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.300
They which just exquisite.

07:54.840 --> 07:55.700
We don't have to worry about it.

07:55.710 --> 07:56.580
The first part is done.

07:56.820 --> 08:00.930
Now, the second part, if I'm coming from a parent or basically that rerouting staff.

08:03.130 --> 08:07.450
Rereading it, and some people call it rerouting it.

08:07.780 --> 08:11.950
There's a new route that we're taking, but it's actually rerouting it.

08:12.440 --> 08:17.860
So this is the second step that now I'm coming from Britain and warned in value from the parent trade.

08:18.370 --> 08:22.120
Let's just make a diagram here.

08:23.020 --> 08:24.280
It said, this is parent.

08:24.790 --> 08:28.070
This is Scotland and this is it.

08:28.270 --> 08:30.640
And the parent has some.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.710
Links with it.

08:32.710 --> 08:34.720
Now this becomes current.

08:36.140 --> 08:45.320
And this becomes X and these lengths ABC, it's called Z, which is the parent and this c h e is this

08:45.950 --> 08:49.670
B is this the is this and that is still the parent.

08:50.210 --> 08:58.670
And I'm going on X if I'm going on to X and I'm already getting one value, which is nothing but g of

08:58.760 --> 08:59.090
that.

08:59.090 --> 09:03.110
Where did you go that for this sub, for this tree above that.

09:03.530 --> 09:04.970
What what are the values.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.580
What is this summation of.

09:09.160 --> 09:09.430
Yeah.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.500
Oh, the Land Rover.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.810
Everything from the lake.

09:13.120 --> 09:18.280
Now, I have to pass a new value to a what we are disputing right now.

09:18.490 --> 09:21.130
We can make a new variable called some parent.

09:21.610 --> 09:21.820
Right?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.740
So this some parent.

09:23.740 --> 09:25.750
And now we'll have another variable called new.

09:25.750 --> 09:26.290
Some parent.

09:27.070 --> 09:28.690
New some parent.

09:28.690 --> 09:30.450
That which will be passing it.

09:30.730 --> 09:31.420
This is new.

09:32.270 --> 09:38.960
Some finished it a new some better and will be nothing but whatever is coming from Z that is competent.

09:40.590 --> 09:43.170
But we also have to add some things in this.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.520
And let me quickly.

09:45.590 --> 09:46.520
Me too, but.

09:47.420 --> 09:52.380
Busting the second, but the first part, which is coming from the parent or then in this case, so

09:52.460 --> 09:59.060
it is what's coming from the company and it's coming from that one parent.

09:59.640 --> 10:03.410
Plus, we know we have to take this agenda consideration.

10:03.410 --> 10:07.410
And for this age I want the subtree size above then that.

10:08.060 --> 10:08.300
Like.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.290
Like what?

10:09.290 --> 10:12.440
What are the total nodes in this tree?

10:13.090 --> 10:14.660
Okay, so there are two ways to find it.

10:14.870 --> 10:21.320
One way is very simple that we know that the total number of nodes in the complementary will be nothing

10:21.320 --> 10:25.970
but n minus the total number of nodes in the library of parent.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.220
Isn't this true?

10:28.790 --> 10:31.580
If I see the subtree of this current this node.

10:32.000 --> 10:32.380
And.

10:33.880 --> 10:38.440
I can simply say it is nothing but end minus the edge of current.

10:39.310 --> 10:40.210
So let me write it.

10:40.510 --> 10:42.010
And this becomes.

10:43.590 --> 10:50.160
Plus the number of Notre Dame this afternoon and it is nothing but end minus a B, which is each.

10:52.040 --> 10:52.730
And minus.

10:53.670 --> 10:54.270
At Joffe.

10:55.110 --> 10:58.830
That it or your parent metastatic parent.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.680
It so.

11:01.580 --> 11:08.120
The news, I'm a bit invalided, I'm going to pass is the value that's already there, the value that

11:08.210 --> 11:15.140
this node disappearing node was getting from Z, which is some period plus and minus edge of this for

11:15.140 --> 11:16.850
all the nodes right now.

11:16.850 --> 11:17.960
Similarly, I have to.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.580
Similarly, I just have to add the values of g x for this and the x for this.

11:23.300 --> 11:29.090
Basically g b d e d c I'll add all these values and liquidated.

11:29.280 --> 11:39.080
Yeah, this becomes g b less t e plus e c and we all know what every node then we have to add for the

11:39.080 --> 11:40.580
other note eight again and again.

11:40.580 --> 11:44.690
So instead of that, what we can do is we can take the whole sum that is.

11:47.490 --> 11:50.100
That is letter D of.

11:51.990 --> 11:53.880
Do you have parent in this case?

11:54.270 --> 11:54.830
In this case.

11:55.140 --> 11:56.090
So it is your friend.

11:56.100 --> 12:02.010
But instead let me write it as the of current strategy of continued will has a somewhat distinctive

12:02.040 --> 12:05.670
from all the other notes I just subtract d of.

12:06.550 --> 12:09.040
X like you're moving downward, right?

12:09.250 --> 12:09.980
The G of current.

12:09.980 --> 12:13.540
My energy of x will give me the sum that I want for all the other nodes.

12:14.380 --> 12:14.740
Correct.

12:15.250 --> 12:19.180
And I simply added some in to my new some parent.

12:19.930 --> 12:24.650
Slightly tricky, but you can do it if you have if you spend enough time on it.

12:25.660 --> 12:26.500
It's not tough.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.670
It's just a little tricky.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.870
So these are the Edge X and you excluded it for now.

12:31.870 --> 12:32.860
We don't want Max.

12:33.460 --> 12:36.420
Instead, what we what we want is we want some it.

12:36.670 --> 12:39.490
So let's have some initial equal to zero and.

12:42.100 --> 12:42.400
Yeah.

12:42.850 --> 12:46.300
If X is not equal to billing, so let's add them into the sum.

12:46.300 --> 12:50.350
And it's digging into the sum because for all of them we want it.

12:50.770 --> 12:56.440
Or instead, instead of seeing this, what we can see is we can see the sum is equal to nothing but

12:56.560 --> 12:57.670
g of getting.

12:59.170 --> 12:59.420
Right.

12:59.860 --> 13:06.680
You've got to have all the comedy for all the other notes, also all the other children also right now.

13:07.270 --> 13:07.810
Let me.

13:08.990 --> 13:09.230
Yeah.

13:09.440 --> 13:14.210
So basically let me replace all the distances, wherever this this is written.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.500
Let me replace it with some.

13:17.070 --> 13:17.330
Right.

13:17.670 --> 13:18.870
And let's move on.

13:18.870 --> 13:20.840
One step, one one step downwards.

13:21.330 --> 13:23.910
News on parent is right now equal to some parent.

13:24.090 --> 13:25.680
Let's take a plus.

13:27.230 --> 13:27.740
Less.

13:28.500 --> 13:32.610
And minus the number of nodes in the current subtree.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.020
Or is it x?

13:34.710 --> 13:41.670
But I know we're moving from current to x eight and I have to follow the new parent value.

13:41.880 --> 13:46.830
So I want actually the number of nodes in the current rate and minus it current.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.110
So here, let me write it as current.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.950
It's so different and when it's going.

13:54.720 --> 13:58.320
And this will be I didn't do mind you some.

13:59.610 --> 14:04.530
Let me remove this loop and yeah, we have to remove this also.

14:06.700 --> 14:12.820
The new Zombieland will be the the some that will be bosses nothing but somebody and bless whatever

14:12.820 --> 14:13.300
was there.

14:14.030 --> 14:16.660
Bless the current voluminous.

14:16.660 --> 14:19.210
Do you accelerate the do you get invalid already?

14:19.210 --> 14:20.320
I've just taken it.

14:21.320 --> 14:21.830
And.

14:23.700 --> 14:24.600
Was the Jaeger invalid.

14:24.870 --> 14:27.840
I wanted it taken instead of it being this valuable.

14:27.870 --> 14:29.420
Here, let me remove it.

14:29.430 --> 14:31.860
And instead it mutated as the current.

14:33.210 --> 14:35.280
So Jaeger in minus Jaeger and plus.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.540
And minus its current.

14:38.510 --> 14:39.320
No, no, no.

14:39.420 --> 14:39.650
Yeah.

14:39.740 --> 14:40.580
This is some parent.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.870
Great, buddy.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.420
Let me bring everything back.

14:44.630 --> 14:44.860
Yeah.

14:44.870 --> 14:46.540
So this is some and this is some in.

14:47.180 --> 14:51.780
But so here in this some is request rejiggering.

14:52.430 --> 14:52.970
It's true.

14:53.590 --> 14:56.480
Ed and I have to make this new.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.600
Some parent equals to somebody.

14:58.600 --> 14:59.240
And plus this.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.890
And in this I will also add.

15:02.610 --> 15:02.910
Yeah.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.200
Let me quickly go back and get gather my thoughts.

15:07.710 --> 15:07.950
Yeah.

15:08.070 --> 15:09.690
So we have already added this.

15:09.690 --> 15:11.520
Some very unpleasant message current.

15:11.970 --> 15:14.310
Now what we want is we want the sum of all the other.

15:15.240 --> 15:22.080
Children of this, which was nothing but je current initially and I I'll have to actually subtract.

15:23.420 --> 15:23.720
The.

15:25.010 --> 15:25.270
Yeah.

15:26.390 --> 15:27.860
But in this forest.

15:28.310 --> 15:32.730
Do you know what ordered as distance of all the notes?

15:32.750 --> 15:33.060
Right.

15:33.440 --> 15:38.580
But instead of this, what we can do is we can simply subtract the values.

15:39.170 --> 15:39.440
So.

15:40.520 --> 15:45.530
Let me boss new some parent as it is and this admin could lead in these values.

15:45.530 --> 15:47.390
And then I come back to the new some parent.

15:48.410 --> 15:49.820
So what is the current?

15:50.270 --> 15:52.610
This will be nothing but plus equals to.

15:53.980 --> 15:54.240
Um.

15:54.430 --> 15:55.540
Let's get back.

15:56.610 --> 16:02.540
So everything has two things when when it is coming from parent and which is nothing but from parent.

16:02.660 --> 16:02.940
Right.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.750
So this is some parent.

16:06.380 --> 16:09.350
And here the F current value is nothing but.

16:12.270 --> 16:18.510
Four other nodes in this are tree rate, which is g current if I'm not wrong because the code installs

16:18.510 --> 16:21.030
to evaluate the value that we need.

16:21.700 --> 16:22.010
Right.

16:22.530 --> 16:27.780
And now let's come back to the new assumption that we want to pass to the next node.

16:28.230 --> 16:28.830
So it is.

16:29.860 --> 16:34.000
Comparing what is coming plus and minus its current because we have moved one step downwards.

16:34.420 --> 16:41.430
Now what we want is we want this new some parent to not include the current child nodes of.

16:42.400 --> 16:42.910
Values.

16:43.600 --> 16:49.990
Basically, instead of taking some here, let's take let's see it's subject from current and it's subject

16:49.990 --> 16:50.410
to.

16:52.410 --> 16:52.860
The.

16:54.060 --> 17:00.030
The answer for the current rate, which is I don't know which I'm going to reduce G of x.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.470
Eight and.
