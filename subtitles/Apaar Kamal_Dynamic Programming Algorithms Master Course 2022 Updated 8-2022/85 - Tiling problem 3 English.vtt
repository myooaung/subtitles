WEBVTT

00:00.830 --> 00:02.300
And everyone, welcome back.

00:02.870 --> 00:05.150
And this is the third interesting problem.

00:05.570 --> 00:08.940
Of course, the borders seem to cross inward and.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.990
Of the titles are of two types.

00:12.990 --> 00:18.150
The first tiles one grows today, and of course this can be rotated horizontally or vertically.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.660
And similarly we have L-shaped.

00:20.370 --> 00:25.310
This can also be rotated in whatever way you want to fill it full.

00:26.380 --> 00:26.740
Now.

00:27.640 --> 00:31.360
Yeah, well, let's write effen, which is simple that.

00:34.210 --> 00:35.460
Number of ways.

00:37.260 --> 00:45.390
Of of course by the video of yourself and then we can move on f any number of ways of telling.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.140
The above two gross and bold.

00:53.020 --> 00:56.100
Great and cool.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.320
So what will be F and equal to case?

01:00.460 --> 01:04.570
Here I can again applying the same approach with the first column.

01:04.570 --> 01:11.320
We do that in minus one, or by applying one day vertically there to cross one delayed or this is by

01:11.320 --> 01:17.230
applying to cross one vertically, writing everything again and again, taking a process by placing

01:17.230 --> 01:18.550
those horizontally.

01:18.550 --> 01:18.880
Right?

01:19.030 --> 01:20.040
So this is this one.

01:20.050 --> 01:22.900
This is this one F in minus two.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.540
And let's find out the.

01:27.070 --> 01:28.160
Use of plates.

01:28.660 --> 01:30.400
As I've already always said.

01:30.970 --> 01:32.420
But I've always said it.

01:32.470 --> 01:34.420
Try and fill the first column only.

01:35.650 --> 01:39.820
If I fill the first column, will the LTE obtained and what I'll get.

01:40.090 --> 01:41.560
Let me quickly draw this.

01:43.650 --> 01:44.520
This is the type.

01:51.970 --> 01:56.110
And here you can see we have a different structure over here.

01:56.120 --> 01:59.680
We don't have a complete F and we have a fin.

02:00.520 --> 02:04.090
I mean, we have this, this is nothing but F and minus two, right?

02:05.390 --> 02:09.560
But with this what we have, we have an additional empty square.

02:11.260 --> 02:11.580
Eight.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.860
So how will you use this additional empty?

02:18.120 --> 02:21.930
What I will do is I will create another state.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.620
And I'll call it the number of ways.

02:30.470 --> 02:31.070
Dialing.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.010
To cross and board.

02:37.130 --> 02:37.460
It.

02:39.420 --> 02:39.900
One.

02:42.840 --> 02:43.740
Additional.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.520
On the first row, on the top row.

02:52.740 --> 02:53.010
Okay.

02:53.100 --> 02:55.350
So basically what I mean is.

02:57.160 --> 03:02.720
If I if I can just imagine that this red part is not there.

03:03.340 --> 03:03.660
Let's see.

03:03.670 --> 03:04.960
This red part is not there.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.040
So how will it look like?

03:06.670 --> 03:08.920
It will look like something like this.

03:11.930 --> 03:12.200
Right.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.390
And, ah, let's see that this is.

03:15.650 --> 03:23.300
This much is in light of what is a number of ways of tackling this, and it will be called the gene

03:23.300 --> 03:28.160
because its its implicit the genetic code, a number of ways of telling to cross and boot.

03:28.190 --> 03:29.930
So this is a to cross and.

03:30.050 --> 03:30.410
Right.

03:32.690 --> 03:36.820
This is a two gross and board with one additional square on the top table.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.120
I hope you got this.

03:39.120 --> 03:39.710
What is G?

03:39.750 --> 03:42.780
And don't get confused by G and minus one and minus two or something.

03:43.170 --> 03:48.720
The end is nothing, but you cross in empty and one additional square on the top left.

03:49.580 --> 03:50.210
Basically.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.320
I hope it's clear.

03:53.450 --> 03:56.510
So tell me if this is equal to G and.

03:58.350 --> 03:58.700
Right.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.820
The end is no square then.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.660
If I place this L-shaped, I like this.

04:03.900 --> 04:04.140
What?

04:04.140 --> 04:04.680
We like it.

04:05.770 --> 04:06.820
I will simply get.

04:08.390 --> 04:10.340
G off and minus two.

04:10.940 --> 04:12.680
Because if this is an.

04:14.190 --> 04:15.000
If this isn't.

04:15.150 --> 04:16.290
Of course this isn't right.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.000
But then this much will be.

04:19.670 --> 04:20.450
And minus two.

04:20.660 --> 04:25.820
And I have one additional square here, so I'll simply say Giovanni minus two, like the limit in the

04:25.820 --> 04:30.470
middle phase of filling this particular area, which is nothing but G of n minus two.

04:30.470 --> 04:31.520
We've already seen this.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.260
I hope this is very clear.

04:34.160 --> 04:34.460
Eight.

04:35.610 --> 04:36.000
Now.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.660
This was one way of placing the L2 right.

04:40.660 --> 04:45.790
The second way of placing the L2 can be I mean, the other way of filling the first column.

04:46.090 --> 04:48.100
Everything is dependent on the first column.

04:49.310 --> 04:51.440
The different ways in which you can fill the first call.

04:55.880 --> 04:56.510
Let me.

04:57.790 --> 04:58.270
So this.

04:59.510 --> 05:01.460
Who can I fill the first column in this very.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.940
I mean, it's l but it's rotated.

05:06.240 --> 05:10.730
So if I rotate it clockwise, then I'll get this right.

05:11.430 --> 05:15.570
So in this way, also, I can fill the first column and it's also a different approach.

05:16.860 --> 05:18.570
Similarly, what I can see is.

05:21.450 --> 05:24.300
As you can see, this is not in play.

05:24.570 --> 05:25.250
This is not G.

05:25.260 --> 05:25.580
And why?

05:25.590 --> 05:31.260
Because GM say audiences that disquiet should be extended to appropriate.

05:31.260 --> 05:34.690
Here this quiet is extra on the bottom line.

05:34.980 --> 05:37.120
So this quiet is extra on the bottom row.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.880
Let's call it edging.

05:41.330 --> 05:44.180
The in one way or the other gene will be equal to it.

05:44.180 --> 05:44.410
And.

05:44.450 --> 05:44.740
Right.

05:44.750 --> 05:49.820
Because if I rotate the whole board, right, the number of ways will be seen.

05:49.850 --> 05:56.330
Of course, the way we look at it is different, but the number of ways DNA is will be equal to it.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.490
But let me quickly add, I it.

05:59.360 --> 05:59.570
Yeah.

05:59.990 --> 06:00.890
What is it, John?

06:00.920 --> 06:04.520
Okay, before this, let me provide some space.

06:06.410 --> 06:06.740
Right.

06:07.430 --> 06:14.960
And let me add in here at the end, it's nothing but a number of ways of tiling to cross n board with

06:14.960 --> 06:17.990
one additional square on the bottom row.

06:21.490 --> 06:22.600
Hate mail.

06:22.600 --> 06:22.870
Gays.

06:24.860 --> 06:28.400
If I place a title this way, then if it is.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.570
And then what?

06:29.660 --> 06:30.140
Then how?

06:30.140 --> 06:31.100
How much is this?

06:31.940 --> 06:33.380
This is and minus.

06:33.830 --> 06:36.290
Similarly, if I want to fill this area.

06:37.990 --> 06:44.980
Which is to Grassland Bird with one additional square on the bottom row, then it becomes edge in rate

06:45.250 --> 06:47.800
and he and minus two.

06:47.890 --> 06:49.630
Then it becomes edge of N minus two.

06:49.900 --> 06:51.130
Let me quickly write it again.

06:51.730 --> 06:55.060
It is edge off and minus eight.

06:55.810 --> 07:00.070
I hope all these four different values are clear.

07:00.070 --> 07:00.430
Right?

07:01.820 --> 07:02.840
Let's go over it again.

07:03.180 --> 07:05.580
My first one was by placing one vertical.

07:05.600 --> 07:10.940
The second one is placing two vertical tiles associated to horizontal tiles.

07:11.480 --> 07:18.050
Third one is placing L and the fourth one is placing them by rotating nature in all four.

07:18.050 --> 07:24.230
I am just filling the first column is remember this, I'm filling the first column completely.

07:24.230 --> 07:26.840
Is there any other way in which I can fill the first column completely?

07:27.810 --> 07:28.110
No.

07:28.830 --> 07:29.090
No.

07:29.190 --> 07:29.570
No.

07:30.090 --> 07:31.680
Otherwise I can think of.

07:32.370 --> 07:34.230
Now we have got this, which is.

07:34.230 --> 07:35.490
We have got to secure the village.

07:35.490 --> 07:39.180
And in terms of G and edge, where we can see that.

07:40.480 --> 07:45.870
Geof and will be equal to edge often because of.

07:47.210 --> 07:56.870
The placement of is different that means and and in the digital but in a number of ways will be seen

07:57.600 --> 07:57.910
later.

07:58.460 --> 08:03.890
Even if it does one one extra cell here or one extra cell over here.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.240
It's kind of the same thing.

08:05.510 --> 08:07.520
If I had ordered, it would becomes the same thing, right?

08:07.520 --> 08:08.960
So the number of bills will be same.

08:09.290 --> 08:18.230
I'm just converting this and often in do nothing but F and minus one plus F and minus two plus doing

08:18.230 --> 08:18.620
into g.

08:18.620 --> 08:20.560
Off and minus two.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.670
I hope this is very clear.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.120
Let's call it equation one.

08:26.330 --> 08:28.910
Eight and yeah.

08:29.330 --> 08:34.070
Let me quickly copy this at me pasted over here.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.450
And now we will try and find the values of Jian eight.

08:39.440 --> 08:39.740
You.

08:40.690 --> 08:44.790
As I said, what is GMG and is nothing but a number of ways of telling to growth and goodwill.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.700
One additional square on the table.

08:47.590 --> 08:52.660
So for our sake, you understand the value of Jian eight.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.580
Let's add one extra.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.130
Kyler Murray.

09:00.730 --> 09:02.480
One extra celery, right?

09:04.110 --> 09:12.320
So the answer of filling all of this by using that L-shaped dial or whatever I can find is eight.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.120
How can I find this?

09:14.600 --> 09:15.890
It will be okay.

09:16.250 --> 09:16.450
Let.

09:16.460 --> 09:16.690
Let's.

09:17.210 --> 09:18.680
This will be the answer to.

09:18.680 --> 09:19.970
This will be often.

09:21.550 --> 09:21.880
Let's see.

09:21.880 --> 09:22.930
How can we find you?

09:22.950 --> 09:25.390
And I've always told you.

09:26.830 --> 09:30.400
Just try and fill.

09:31.310 --> 09:31.470
What?

09:31.670 --> 09:32.060
What will you.

09:32.060 --> 09:32.630
Fallujah.

09:32.930 --> 09:34.700
This train will be.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.290
All right.

09:37.870 --> 09:40.810
So here I can see the first column is this.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.350
This is the first column.

09:43.830 --> 09:45.490
So let's win this.

09:45.990 --> 09:50.880
So the one way in which I can fill it is by placing one horizontal two across one type.

09:51.390 --> 09:55.260
Let's place one horizontal to cross one type which will go over this.

09:55.310 --> 09:55.590
Right.

09:55.590 --> 09:57.570
So this is one horizontal to cross one day.

09:59.570 --> 10:01.490
Now, guys, as you can see here.

10:02.550 --> 10:03.120
Jian.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.560
Converts to nothing but.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.670
Engine minus one.

10:11.590 --> 10:13.870
Because if this isn't, then this becomes.

10:16.010 --> 10:17.000
And minus one.

10:17.890 --> 10:18.850
I hope this is clear.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.120
And I have an extra silverware here in the bottom drawer.

10:22.210 --> 10:28.300
So this becomes agent minus one, which is nothing but G and minus one, because we know that the number

10:28.300 --> 10:30.540
of virus in it.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.470
This was one way of placing it, one way of filling it late.

10:34.780 --> 10:37.060
And let's see, the second way of filling it.

10:40.540 --> 10:44.440
The second we are filling it is by placing an L-shaped type rate.

10:44.530 --> 10:46.090
So how can I place an L-shaped?

10:46.090 --> 10:47.770
Alia It's place an L-shaped.

10:47.770 --> 10:48.940
Alia Which is this?

10:56.840 --> 10:59.600
This was the second way of filling this first column.

11:00.770 --> 11:02.120
So how did I fill this first column?

11:02.120 --> 11:03.320
By placing it elsewhere.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.420
By rotating it and placing it over here.

11:06.050 --> 11:07.160
What does this give me?

11:09.180 --> 11:09.420
Okay.

11:09.420 --> 11:11.160
Let me remove this for now.

11:11.220 --> 11:11.470
Yeah.

11:11.490 --> 11:12.090
What does this?

11:12.090 --> 11:13.170
Give me less.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.800
And what is this value base?

11:15.090 --> 11:16.260
We all know it.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.550
What shape it is.

11:17.820 --> 11:19.910
It is just a to gross and what.

11:19.920 --> 11:20.170
Right.

11:20.190 --> 11:23.670
It's not the edge or a D and or edge.

11:23.690 --> 11:24.720
And it is simple.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.380
Evan Bayh.

11:26.850 --> 11:31.680
So if this value, then then this becomes and -$1 and then minus one.

11:31.930 --> 11:38.940
But what I say is it is equals to each of N, minus one plus F and minus one.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.960
I hope the things are being cleared away.

11:43.080 --> 11:43.830
This is important.

11:44.940 --> 11:49.250
So this this is the value of G and simply replacing it with G.

11:49.290 --> 11:53.520
What I'll get I'll simply get the g is nothing but g n minus one plus.

11:53.710 --> 11:54.480
Even minus.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.200
But hey, so now I have two variables.

11:58.440 --> 11:59.100
So the first.

12:00.180 --> 12:03.260
Prosecution is open, and the second aggression is Jian.

12:03.720 --> 12:03.940
Right.

12:04.430 --> 12:06.290
Let's figure out the best cases case.

12:06.740 --> 12:07.760
It will be very easy.

12:08.630 --> 12:13.010
So let's figure out the best case for what will be a40.

12:14.780 --> 12:19.760
A number of ways of filling zero cross end, but it will be zero eight.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.740
What will be a fourth one?

12:22.400 --> 12:23.510
It will be nothing but.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.590
But by placing one, they like this fate.

12:28.980 --> 12:31.500
And what will be the U of zero?

12:33.940 --> 12:34.720
It will be zero.

12:34.750 --> 12:35.620
I cannot fill it.

12:35.950 --> 12:39.040
And what will be the of one?

12:44.160 --> 12:45.330
What will be the offerings?

12:45.690 --> 12:46.380
It will be.

12:47.210 --> 12:48.210
Let me make the offer.

12:48.210 --> 12:49.080
One zero.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.460
One means nothing but this.

12:51.830 --> 12:52.090
Eight.

12:52.410 --> 12:59.240
That there's one desire to cross one board with one external goal among the top.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.990
The giovane is nothing but fun because there's only one.

13:03.020 --> 13:07.130
One way in which I can fill this by placing an edge here and nothing else.

13:07.990 --> 13:11.690
Eight This is f0 f1 g zero g1.

13:12.850 --> 13:13.900
Right now.

13:14.560 --> 13:14.980
Let's.

13:15.280 --> 13:15.970
Ryan, could it?

13:16.780 --> 13:19.360
Well, in the next year, children could develop in the best cases.

13:19.360 --> 13:25.300
And we simply have the values of D and we will simply form the values of D and then will improve on

13:25.300 --> 13:28.960
the values of AV using D and finally bring the answer.

13:30.100 --> 13:30.250
So.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.240
So in the next part case.

13:31.360 --> 13:31.680
Thanks.
