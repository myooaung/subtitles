00:01.010 --> 00:02.010
Always so.

00:02.030 --> 00:09.530
Welcome to the real world metrics explanation the magic tricks when intuition will come handy in various

00:09.530 --> 00:11.060
dynamic programming problems.

00:11.330 --> 00:17.780
And all those are all those problems in which you will be solving some linear reconciliation, right?

00:18.290 --> 00:23.330
So for example, I'll give you the very basic example and then we'll move on to various different examples,

00:23.330 --> 00:23.840
of course.

00:24.340 --> 00:25.010
And so.

00:26.020 --> 00:30.820
Right now, I'm just a small catfish here, and I'll help you prevent this catfish.

00:30.820 --> 00:31.120
Right.

00:31.510 --> 00:33.160
So when Will called, Manteca explains.

00:33.520 --> 00:33.970
I will.

00:35.020 --> 00:38.890
Not pass to the mattresses, but will walk on dirty mattresses.

00:38.890 --> 00:39.640
In methods.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.480
In different methods.

00:41.620 --> 00:44.200
Eight two pointers are a nuisance.

00:44.770 --> 00:46.720
They might be, but we'll avoid them.

00:47.050 --> 00:48.430
Eight will avoid nuisance.

00:50.120 --> 00:54.200
Now let's understand how this matrix expanded work with an example.

00:54.440 --> 00:55.910
So let's take an example first.

00:57.680 --> 00:58.010
Let's see.

00:58.010 --> 00:58.730
I want to find out.

00:58.910 --> 01:00.020
And it's Fibonacci number.

01:01.760 --> 01:02.930
And it's Fibonacci number.

01:02.940 --> 01:08.390
So it's a very famous series, guys, Fibonacci number series because it is being used in various places.

01:08.390 --> 01:14.210
And there are some well-known facts about from an economist, you can easily search those facts.

01:14.780 --> 01:19.010
So if I want to find out the and it's forbidden economy so let me write first few times of the series.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.960
It is one one.

01:20.960 --> 01:21.860
The first time is one.

01:21.860 --> 01:22.730
The signal damage one.

01:22.970 --> 01:24.710
Now the third time is equal.

01:24.920 --> 01:32.180
The third time follows this pattern that our fourth end is equal to F off and minus one plus and minus

01:32.780 --> 01:33.080
two.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.460
That means F of three will be equal to f two.

01:37.790 --> 01:40.970
It is three minus one plus three minus two is F often.

01:41.660 --> 01:44.810
So the next term is equal to the sum of previous two times eight.

01:44.810 --> 01:50.390
So it is two, two plus one is three, five, eight, 13.

01:51.830 --> 01:52.610
21.

01:53.750 --> 01:54.140
30.

01:55.220 --> 01:55.820
Have a missed.

01:55.830 --> 01:56.120
No.

01:56.690 --> 01:57.050
13.

01:57.090 --> 01:59.840
Mr. Anderson is 34 and then 34.

01:59.840 --> 02:00.500
And next is.

02:01.630 --> 02:02.890
34 tentativeness.

02:03.250 --> 02:04.360
Five and five.

02:04.360 --> 02:04.940
55.

02:04.960 --> 02:05.500
And so on.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.650
So it's an advantage.

02:06.670 --> 02:07.030
It is.

02:07.030 --> 02:08.440
It is now in Indian cities.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.440
And after a certain time it was like exponentially.

02:12.070 --> 02:12.320
Eight.

02:12.580 --> 02:15.400
You can easily see this vertical cities.

02:16.300 --> 02:16.530
Eight.

02:16.630 --> 02:19.080
So if I want to find out the end, it's the one I can.

02:19.120 --> 02:22.580
But and it's the end is less than equals to return to the power.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.080
Six.

02:23.590 --> 02:24.820
It becomes very easy for me.

02:24.820 --> 02:26.680
I can directly use dynamic programming.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.440
Dynamic programming.

02:32.430 --> 02:32.750
Right.

02:33.300 --> 02:37.020
And a very simple code base of you can easily undo this.

02:37.080 --> 02:42.660
Not a big deal if still you have a problem using dynamic programming for finding just a few number.

02:42.660 --> 02:45.210
Just go watch a section on dynamic programming.

02:46.230 --> 02:54.030
And in there the first example will be of event numbers, inventory, DP A Not a big deal, so doing

02:54.060 --> 02:55.440
programming is not a big deal for women.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.880
It's very easy stuff, so.

03:00.010 --> 03:06.580
What happens in the name of good is that you take an area of land, think about six, eight, and what

03:06.580 --> 03:09.520
you do is you calculate that are done by using the first two.

03:10.570 --> 03:13.690
Then you calculate the fourth by using their second and third term.

03:14.110 --> 03:14.580
And you.

03:15.550 --> 03:18.640
That means you take an area and you simply fill the four student.

03:18.670 --> 03:24.100
That to be one is one and DP who is also one, and then they be three.

03:24.100 --> 03:32.140
You run a loop from three to in and say their DP is equals to the DP, a is equals to DP, i.e. minus

03:32.140 --> 03:33.970
one plus API minus two.

03:35.810 --> 03:36.200
So.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.950
This is a normal loop from.

03:43.980 --> 03:44.850
You're doing great.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.370
And after the loop ends, we have the end to number four.

03:47.490 --> 03:48.900
So we have the opinion after this.

03:50.100 --> 03:55.890
But guys, this is not the perfect solution that I want, because it is for less than equal to ten,

03:55.890 --> 04:01.920
double over six and eight to for lots of my lots of my friends got this problem is going to be a problem

04:01.920 --> 04:08.400
that like a follow up problem this may not end this list in enclosed return to the poverty team.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.940
Now, how do you get to this particular?

04:13.090 --> 04:16.210
You're going to kill them if and it's so huge.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.880
You cannot apply this love from three to in.

04:19.330 --> 04:23.560
Because again, we cannot have a tender, devoted deal and it will take a huge time.

04:24.490 --> 04:24.770
Eight.

04:26.040 --> 04:26.740
How do you solve this?

04:26.760 --> 04:28.100
How do you figure this out?

04:28.200 --> 04:28.980
Like, what is the.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.600
And also is that number will be huge.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.980
Of course, guys, this number will also be huge.

04:33.990 --> 04:36.810
That is people an accurate entity, but it will also be huge.

04:37.320 --> 04:43.770
Generally, when we face this problem, they will say that Kmart, just like Big Mart, is actually

04:43.770 --> 04:45.150
a compensation.

04:45.510 --> 04:50.420
It's actually a drawback of our languages, of the computer systems we have now.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.980
It maybe not up to 100 or 200 years.

04:53.190 --> 04:54.790
Right now, this is a drawback.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.550
It's a bit more to.

04:57.990 --> 05:00.000
Like retaining inert limits.

05:01.340 --> 05:01.620
Right.

05:02.270 --> 05:02.570
Okay.

05:02.990 --> 05:05.780
So how do you solve this problem in any standard about it?

05:06.110 --> 05:10.670
So that's the main problem that we are going to discuss in this election.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.290
Right here, guys.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.880
What I'll do is I'll take three.

05:15.030 --> 05:19.500
Mattresses and just show you an example and everything will become all clear.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.570
So let's take three mattresses.

05:22.290 --> 05:25.020
The first mattress that I'm taking is a normal matrix.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.100
And let's call it.

05:27.160 --> 05:27.970
Evan matrix.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.100
Evan kept delivering this.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.590
Evan metrics is two growth, one metrics.

05:32.590 --> 05:34.240
And in this I will be storing.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.340
Evan Which is the end attribute.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.090
Nick But and.

05:37.090 --> 05:38.140
Evan Minus one.

05:40.110 --> 05:40.410
Well.

05:41.430 --> 05:48.020
Now what happens is I have a few metrics, let's call it B metrics, and I'll fill the values later.

05:48.090 --> 05:55.320
But I want you to feel the values of the stream ratings have on your to find out the mentions of this

05:55.320 --> 05:55.890
tree matrix.

05:55.890 --> 06:03.180
So if I multiply the metrics to this effort metrics that is D into F in these metrics, give me F in

06:03.180 --> 06:03.660
plus one.

06:05.540 --> 06:12.890
Is this into this equals this f of endless fun to wherever and I just replace it boundless fun.

06:13.220 --> 06:14.420
And with one is when using.

06:17.150 --> 06:19.910
What should be my metrics of video games?

06:22.190 --> 06:27.920
Very easy that this f of endless one metrics is actually nothing but.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.170
How is it f of endless wonder?

06:31.170 --> 06:36.480
Dennis It is written as F and blue seven minus one eight the sum of previous or terms in Fibonacci.

06:36.810 --> 06:41.640
It is, and this is open if I dig two ones of it here.

06:41.640 --> 06:45.540
So this one multiplies with this happen and this one multiplies with this happen.

06:46.230 --> 06:50.960
This row multiplies with this column and gives me f of endless but eight.

06:51.390 --> 06:56.640
Secondly, in the second, what we have to do is get I want a friend to be here so I can take it one

06:56.640 --> 06:56.940
zero.

06:57.690 --> 07:00.700
If I multiply this row with this column, it gives me a friend.

07:02.170 --> 07:02.470
Well.

07:03.650 --> 07:04.910
So very easy.

07:05.030 --> 07:10.760
It's not a big deal if I multiplied the matrix with F and it gives me I think this one eight now.

07:12.960 --> 07:18.150
Now let's see this f this f anything goes to f off.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.760
All right, so let's say D and do f off.

07:22.110 --> 07:23.970
This will give me a43.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.640
Similarly, 18 to f of.

07:27.770 --> 07:33.670
They will give me f off or immediately during the F or for will give me f off.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.330
By you and so on.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.160
It will go on forever.

07:38.710 --> 07:48.310
But look, if I replace F4 in this equation by the industry, then I can write this way.

07:48.340 --> 07:50.160
The into being the F3.

07:52.870 --> 07:54.190
Is Eagles do a for five.

07:54.220 --> 07:56.170
So let's say I'm just trying to find a fight.

07:56.200 --> 08:05.680
So now in Alexa Bliss, F3, by using this equation here, what I get is being to be into e into f of

08:06.220 --> 08:07.900
a two is.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.140
Uh.

08:10.180 --> 08:10.400
Yeah.

08:10.420 --> 08:11.120
One more record.

08:11.140 --> 08:12.280
Is he going to have a fight?

08:13.120 --> 08:19.660
Okay, so basically, guys, if I want to find out some F of HN and I know what is f of to what is f

08:19.660 --> 08:25.060
of to f of to is nothing but of the f to dumb and the F1 dumb which is one one.

08:25.970 --> 08:28.730
The base case is basically rate base cases.

08:31.290 --> 08:31.710
So.

08:31.860 --> 08:32.220
Yeah.

08:34.330 --> 08:34.690
Okay.

08:34.750 --> 08:40.720
So what happens is if I want to find out be of end of this actually becomes the coup de power and minus

08:40.720 --> 08:42.190
to yes or no.

08:45.870 --> 08:47.400
Due to the power and minus to.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.940
Indyref2 is it going to happen?

08:49.950 --> 08:53.210
So we know these all are mattresses which are being multiplied.

08:53.900 --> 09:01.460
Multiply follows that property of whatever it is associated of community in which in to be in to see

09:01.760 --> 09:02.510
is equal.

09:02.510 --> 09:03.290
To in.

09:03.290 --> 09:04.310
To be to see.

09:05.210 --> 09:05.460
Eight.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.000
I'm just a blanket probably over here.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.130
And simply I grouped all these.

09:10.130 --> 09:11.750
I'm just simply multiplying all these.

09:11.780 --> 09:13.760
I'm just finding the power in minus two.

09:13.760 --> 09:17.150
What is t over here is a matrix 1110.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.500
This is matrix.

09:20.260 --> 09:25.610
Well, now what what is the solution that I've come up to that if I want to find out when a key and

09:26.030 --> 09:32.960
I simply have to find out due to the power in my insulin multiplied by F of two that will give me effen,

09:32.960 --> 09:33.980
which is effen.

09:35.510 --> 09:42.500
And if in minus one and I'm just written the topmost value that will be equal to if and how do I do

09:42.500 --> 09:45.440
this is how do I find due to the power in minus two.

09:46.990 --> 09:47.470
Again.

09:48.040 --> 09:52.630
We can use a binary exponential here instead of multiplying t one by one.

09:52.630 --> 10:00.430
Here I can directly by node, by PD power and minus two by using binary exponential because n minus

10:00.430 --> 10:01.270
two is an integer.

10:03.440 --> 10:09.200
I can simply say by this time, simply what we'll do is we'll take a resulting.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.970
They're doing metrics that will be of one identity metrics.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.400
Other metrics will be metrics.

10:17.970 --> 10:18.350
And.

10:19.990 --> 10:22.180
In each separate initiative.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.350
What I do is simple.

10:24.250 --> 10:30.280
Just as binary expand injection we do that resultant will be equal to resulting into it if the last

10:30.280 --> 10:31.210
registered insulin.

10:31.360 --> 10:36.420
And so basically just consider e this t as another integer, right?

10:36.500 --> 10:41.950
So we know as in D just multiply so so do matrix multiply as integers add up.

10:41.950 --> 10:43.780
So do matrices add up.

10:45.350 --> 10:45.590
Eight.

10:45.980 --> 10:51.790
I'm just instead of doing a inches, you know, four, and then I'm doing in binary exponential metrics.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.360
It is called metaphysics.

10:53.360 --> 10:59.560
When in execution it's instead of in these multiplications and additions will be having method which

10:59.570 --> 11:02.960
will multiply mattresses and add mattresses.

11:03.410 --> 11:11.660
So those methods will not take us to the editor as in as an argument, because I'll be telling you a

11:11.660 --> 11:13.610
best way to call this out.

11:14.060 --> 11:16.340
Eight And you won't be like having this face.

11:17.700 --> 11:18.060
Whatever.

11:18.060 --> 11:18.360
This.

11:19.770 --> 11:20.840
It is eight.

11:22.470 --> 11:23.270
I hope you.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.560
I hope you got this.

11:24.570 --> 11:24.900
That.

11:27.010 --> 11:32.140
Instead of in business, we'll just use mattresses, multiply them, add them, whatever we do.

11:32.140 --> 11:34.120
And simply.

11:35.750 --> 11:36.890
Use them, right?

11:38.330 --> 11:39.740
So I think that's it.

11:40.750 --> 11:44.170
And so, first of all, guys, I want you to call it out yourself.

11:44.650 --> 11:46.960
I like ride method, ride functions.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.790
If you ever understood this part, just.

11:49.620 --> 11:56.300
Do the do it yourself first and then move on to the next video in which I'll put it out there.

11:57.270 --> 11:58.490
So there are various examples.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.700
Let me give you another example.

12:00.270 --> 12:03.900
This was a very easy to get installation, and let me give you a tougher one.

12:04.470 --> 12:06.180
If any request to E of a.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.240
These are the gods of religion.

12:10.850 --> 12:13.440
Any recurrence rate.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.700
So instead of care to live, let's have smaller.

12:17.180 --> 12:18.590
The EFSF and.

12:19.800 --> 12:29.850
Izzy goes to f f of n minus one plus B of F and minus two plus C, F and minus three less d.

12:30.570 --> 12:31.530
How do you solve this?

12:35.050 --> 12:40.630
So guys, whenever you face or whenever you will just face a recursive relation, a linear negative

12:40.630 --> 12:44.230
relation, and you want to use metric exponential.

12:44.710 --> 12:46.480
My first advice for you will be to.

12:47.430 --> 12:48.030
Make this.

12:48.980 --> 12:49.400
Vector.

12:49.400 --> 12:53.420
I make this vector that is effen and make this vector which is a effen.

12:53.690 --> 12:59.930
Plus, when you take Efron Victor like Boardwalk thinks I have to make the next next what word things

13:00.620 --> 13:03.140
and then make the t victor accordingly.

13:03.560 --> 13:07.130
If I multiply to do this, I'll get this eight to.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.580
So let's let's all this just positivity.

13:10.580 --> 13:16.400
If you don't want solidarity and just positive attitude, think about it and then you deep into this

13:16.580 --> 13:20.900
hit ABC are some of my students that are being given to us.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.720
So as I said, first of all.

13:25.570 --> 13:28.660
We will have this F in matrix and we will like.

13:30.650 --> 13:31.560
Manipulate relay.

13:31.580 --> 13:33.720
Keep on changing or don't we need eight.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.470
So here we have f and bless one matrix.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.300
Let's f in here.

13:38.870 --> 13:40.280
F in minus one here.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.600
F in minus two here.

13:42.880 --> 13:43.300
And.

13:43.870 --> 13:44.890
Yeah, well, let's.

13:44.960 --> 13:45.940
I have a friend plus one.

13:46.960 --> 13:47.730
A friend.

13:50.610 --> 13:57.270
I finally an F and minus one because I'm replacing and rent and and plus one and it's I have the year

13:58.140 --> 13:58.830
eight or.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.220
Instead of delayed statement.

14:02.650 --> 14:03.410
You'll come to know.

14:03.430 --> 14:04.330
Why am I doing this?

14:06.500 --> 14:06.810
So.

14:06.860 --> 14:07.160
Yeah.

14:08.420 --> 14:12.250
Now let's make this semantics case to make a fine plus one.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.830
What I want is I want one fun.

14:15.410 --> 14:17.410
One that is fun to have.

14:17.750 --> 14:21.080
But in not one buddy body, not one I have.

14:21.380 --> 14:23.840
I want e into heaven.

14:24.290 --> 14:24.860
B into.

14:26.070 --> 14:27.090
F in minus one.

14:27.780 --> 14:29.420
The interferon minus two ending.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.070
Which is equal to evolve and blossom.

14:32.510 --> 14:36.180
Hey, now I want Evan in the second place.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.040
So what is Efron in this again?

14:38.070 --> 14:38.290
Place?

14:38.310 --> 14:39.090
It will be simple.

14:39.090 --> 14:40.380
1000.

14:41.510 --> 14:43.160
It was Venom, replied the second row.

14:43.160 --> 14:47.000
With this I will go to heaven, and it is 0100.

14:47.600 --> 14:51.320
Then it is 00108.

14:51.650 --> 14:52.010
So.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.310
Yes, I get effin I get f in my innocent.

14:55.310 --> 14:56.030
But here goes.

14:56.030 --> 14:59.210
Whatever it is, I won't want to be carried forward.

15:00.190 --> 15:06.040
I do not want f and minus to do a dislocation late, so the last row needs to be changed.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.870
What will I have in the last room?

15:10.470 --> 15:11.370
I want one later.

15:11.370 --> 15:12.750
It will be 0001.

15:14.310 --> 15:15.450
So this is mathematics.

15:15.480 --> 15:20.580
If I multiplied this matrix to F in matrix algorithm plus one, then again multiply multiplied by 30

15:20.580 --> 15:23.550
again Elliot F and my F Bliss two and then again and so on.

15:24.210 --> 15:29.660
If I want to find f of and is fine, go to the power end and simply multiply it by four, you know,

15:30.330 --> 15:30.600
eight.

15:31.370 --> 15:33.530
And you can easily solve this thing.

15:34.370 --> 15:36.590
Well, guys, I hope you are able to.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.370
Go with this.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.380
And in the next video we will.

15:40.680 --> 15:43.820
So this is another example of a reconciliation.

15:43.830 --> 15:45.240
You can have various examples.

15:46.500 --> 15:52.070
And now we will see an efficient way of calling this in the next story.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.730
Well, thank you ways.
