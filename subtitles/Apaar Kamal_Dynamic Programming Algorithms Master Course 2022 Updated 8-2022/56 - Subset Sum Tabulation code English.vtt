00:01.140 --> 00:01.740
Hello, everyone.

00:01.920 --> 00:04.920
So here I have filled all the values of the table.

00:06.120 --> 00:06.990
You saved some time.

00:06.990 --> 00:08.820
And I just want to trace back.

00:08.820 --> 00:09.060
Right.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.320
So basically, what's my final answer?

00:11.340 --> 00:12.570
This is my final answer.

00:13.260 --> 00:20.360
This particular self tells me whether the sum of 12 is possible from the above 88 from the whole area.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.360
So we can see that, yes, the sum of 12 is possible.

00:24.840 --> 00:28.770
Let's see what are the different ways in which I'm getting this sum of light?

00:28.890 --> 00:29.820
So let's face it.

00:30.450 --> 00:32.910
Of course, we'll have multiple answers here.

00:33.380 --> 00:36.080
So we can have multiple answers.

00:36.750 --> 00:41.970
But I'm just I will just trace back one answer right here from this one.

00:42.270 --> 00:44.550
This one actually comes from two places.

00:44.970 --> 00:45.270
Right.

00:45.390 --> 00:46.440
What is the first place?

00:46.470 --> 00:47.460
The first places.

00:47.490 --> 00:48.870
Okay, let me see.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.150
In the first place is this.

00:51.480 --> 00:55.500
And this again, places below -19 without a bond.

00:55.650 --> 00:57.870
So, of course, this is coming from only one place.

00:57.870 --> 00:59.010
And which is.

01:00.240 --> 01:00.720
Admitted.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.940
So this 512 is coming from four Roma.

01:09.010 --> 01:13.170
Well, that means 19 is not included in my answer.

01:13.950 --> 01:18.090
But because we are moving, just a stop means x minus one comma y, which was the exclusion.

01:18.900 --> 01:24.930
Now this one, we can easily see that it is not coming from above zero because above is zero.

01:24.930 --> 01:25.160
Right.

01:25.170 --> 01:26.820
That means the or we we're digging.

01:26.820 --> 01:27.310
All right.

01:27.360 --> 01:32.100
If it is zero, then it has to be something on the left of it, which is, well, minus five, where

01:32.100 --> 01:33.960
it is still minus five, seven.

01:34.170 --> 01:35.820
So we can see that big.

01:35.820 --> 01:36.870
Almost seven is true.

01:37.940 --> 01:38.210
Right.

01:38.750 --> 01:41.870
So that means it's coming this way.

01:42.770 --> 01:50.960
Coming from this particular I mean, this one is coming from this one, which means that it is Eddie.

01:51.740 --> 01:51.910
Yeah.

01:51.950 --> 01:52.460
Eddie's here.

01:53.200 --> 01:53.770
Five.

01:54.540 --> 01:55.070
Or.

01:56.570 --> 02:00.440
That means five is included in my solution, but I'm including it.

02:00.590 --> 02:02.030
It's coming from the second part.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.650
Now this one.

02:03.980 --> 02:08.990
So here what we can see is the values or 8 to 10 minutes for this tree.

02:09.290 --> 02:13.970
We see that it's not coming from this particular cell, which is Takoma tree, but it is coming from

02:14.900 --> 02:16.010
comma seven.

02:16.130 --> 02:19.110
That means forest not included in my eight.

02:19.460 --> 02:20.750
And this.

02:21.080 --> 02:25.640
And then finally, this particular seven is coming from.

02:26.950 --> 02:29.860
This is zero comma.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.540
It is one comma zero.

02:31.810 --> 02:33.640
That means I'm moving left.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.410
That means I'm using the second.

02:36.710 --> 02:38.930
That means it is included in my solution.

02:39.290 --> 02:45.230
And this one, Gamma Zero, is coming from this zero zero.

02:45.230 --> 02:47.240
That means I'm moving upwards, including it.

02:47.480 --> 02:48.140
I'm not including.

02:48.620 --> 02:52.730
But you can see easily that this seven plus five is equals two.

02:53.540 --> 03:00.830
But so here it's not, you know, this this table not only tells me about 12, but it also tells me

03:00.830 --> 03:07.250
what 1111 sum is possible from the first end element, which is here, whether ten is possible, whether

03:07.250 --> 03:09.800
nine is possible, it is possible or not.

03:11.810 --> 03:13.460
So it is a multipurpose table.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.110
So what I would suggest is.

03:16.090 --> 03:22.910
Why don't you try and trace this back like five and 11, like from various 511?

03:24.050 --> 03:26.450
How is a sum of 11 being informed by.

03:27.810 --> 03:28.440
Five elements.

03:29.130 --> 03:29.320
Eight.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.160
Try to trace it back and see.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.460
Solution for yourself right now.

03:35.460 --> 03:38.640
Of course, I can tell you about it.

03:41.070 --> 03:41.370
Yeah.

03:41.490 --> 03:41.790
So.

03:43.410 --> 03:44.250
It's called this.

03:45.940 --> 03:46.110
Well.

03:46.330 --> 03:48.850
So this was the normal substitution problem from.

03:49.850 --> 03:52.130
Bottom up recursive approach.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.240
Now, let me call this as a bottom up route.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.270
So what I have is I have some comma end.

04:02.090 --> 04:02.780
And.

04:05.990 --> 04:07.200
Oh, okay.

04:07.220 --> 04:08.570
So let's dig at it one bit.

04:09.570 --> 04:09.790
Okay.

04:09.800 --> 04:14.270
So let's dig the area as a one based index and let's say.

04:15.220 --> 04:17.290
At a it starts from one to win.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.470
I want to bring this exact table.

04:21.070 --> 04:22.900
And I I've taken things one basic index here.

04:23.380 --> 04:24.880
What I do is I this scene.

04:26.080 --> 04:31.750
And what let's do one thing, let's say of the radicals to pull this making the sequester zero.

04:31.750 --> 04:35.350
Because here also if I take zero, doesn't it zero zero.

04:36.670 --> 04:38.800
But zeroes in this problem actually doesn't make.

04:40.590 --> 04:45.120
And finally, let's make this table call.

04:45.150 --> 04:47.910
DP And what is the number of rows in this?

04:47.910 --> 04:52.320
It is not equal to and plus one the columns are some plus one.

04:52.680 --> 04:57.840
And after this, what we'll do is we'll optimize it also will we can optimize the memory complex.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.540
So here what we can see is it's on a loop.

05:08.290 --> 05:08.440
It.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.250
Let's see.

05:13.510 --> 05:15.880
Look, this can be a bowling alley as well.

05:16.060 --> 05:18.370
We can have this in L.A., also in Brisbane.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.110
It's a billionaire.

05:20.970 --> 05:24.090
Well, because we have to her tend to avoid it.

05:24.330 --> 05:26.460
And I'll give you a follow up problem, guys.

05:26.670 --> 05:27.420
Why don't you try?

05:27.430 --> 05:34.290
The problem is, instead of finding whether it is possible, if I know the number of its number of ways

05:35.160 --> 05:35.790
in which.

05:41.340 --> 05:47.890
It's possible from the given that it ain't be exactly one thing you know for what we live will have.

05:49.510 --> 05:49.900
Right.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.040
And then you'll realize it.

05:53.580 --> 05:56.130
Now we will go, Dylan.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.730
Finally, we will start.

06:00.650 --> 06:02.240
From zero and quarter.

06:03.320 --> 06:05.950
We are going over all diary the column.

06:06.430 --> 06:08.900
So what's the specialty about the first row?

06:09.940 --> 06:12.370
So I can see that.

06:13.870 --> 06:17.830
If it's let's make this special, these cases and these special cases.

06:18.760 --> 06:19.890
So what's the basis?

06:20.440 --> 06:21.310
Let's talk about.

06:23.530 --> 06:28.600
Why don't I just fill the first row automatically or.

06:30.200 --> 06:30.560
Cool.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.230
Cool could do it anyways in the best.

06:33.320 --> 06:33.800
It's easier.

06:34.460 --> 06:39.560
You can fill the first row here or you can fill the first row here as with it so you can try both the

06:39.560 --> 06:44.840
is ready to let me right over there only it's a deep zero zero is one that means it's true.

06:46.070 --> 06:49.910
That means, you know, if something is not possible, if there's no element.

06:50.270 --> 06:51.860
And let me fill the first column.

06:53.270 --> 06:53.540
Will.

06:54.800 --> 06:55.220
It's filled.

06:55.230 --> 07:00.650
The first column was column start and now it will start from there and go to some and I will fill it

07:00.650 --> 07:04.340
with ab00 is.

07:05.520 --> 07:11.250
All that means not some, nor some is possible from the zero elements.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.830
Well, not it started from one because we feel dizzy.

07:15.210 --> 07:17.370
So now it will be very easy for us.

07:17.640 --> 07:25.770
So what I'll do is I'll simply say that DP IED is nothing, but it is illegal to DP a minus one committee.

07:26.490 --> 07:27.150
It would just follow.

07:27.150 --> 07:27.750
It is false.

07:28.920 --> 07:29.730
Otherwise it will destroy.

07:29.730 --> 07:30.420
It will be true.

07:30.690 --> 07:32.370
And then I can never second guess.

07:32.370 --> 07:34.300
Which is it?

07:34.330 --> 07:35.460
The idea is not.

07:36.330 --> 07:36.780
Uh.

07:37.470 --> 07:37.730
Yeah.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.380
So the second case is only possible if.

07:41.710 --> 07:45.570
Evolution of a straight D equation.

07:46.290 --> 07:47.490
The equation is simple.

07:47.580 --> 07:50.250
Everybody is also, you know.

07:51.290 --> 07:53.150
Or equals to BP.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.230
I minus one and D-minus.

07:59.820 --> 08:01.440
This was a great debate.

08:02.430 --> 08:07.170
Articles written by Minassian commanding minor say We don't have to worry about this one because we

08:07.170 --> 08:09.080
are starting from one and we are pretty.

08:09.390 --> 08:09.800
You wrote.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.840
We just have to worry about this.

08:13.140 --> 08:18.390
J minus eight does not go below zero, so we'll just add a new field and do my nausea.

08:18.660 --> 08:23.430
It'd be great anyway, but you know, to say is greater than or equal to a third.

08:23.740 --> 08:27.000
And if it is in good any good way, then it will take.

08:27.000 --> 08:27.390
Or.

08:28.650 --> 08:28.950
So.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.400
This is the normal solution.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.820
This is exclusion, illusion.

08:37.870 --> 08:38.350
Illusion.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.220
Rule two, I have both exclusion and inclusion here.

08:42.220 --> 08:43.950
And this will go over and then.

08:44.470 --> 08:47.290
And finally, what I bring I just sprint and comma.

08:49.570 --> 08:49.870
Eight.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.070
Oh, yeah.

08:52.340 --> 08:54.080
Well, some of the world is possible.

08:54.590 --> 08:56.180
Let's bring some of country to.

08:58.770 --> 09:00.510
Though some offering to do is.

09:02.400 --> 09:02.730
Okay.

09:03.090 --> 09:04.410
What are some?

09:05.980 --> 09:06.340
Yep.

09:06.460 --> 09:14.380
So right now what we have is we have an Amazon that I hope you all understood this problem and.

09:15.550 --> 09:16.840
It means you in the.

09:18.010 --> 09:18.520
But.

09:20.830 --> 09:24.610
I just want to check if I'm missing something here because I'm not going to do.

09:24.610 --> 09:25.810
Should not be possible.

09:26.590 --> 09:27.340
Was it possible?

09:29.760 --> 09:34.110
I'm afraid it is not possible from these elements.

09:34.110 --> 09:34.680
Or is it?

09:36.250 --> 09:36.570
Okay.

09:36.580 --> 09:37.330
I take it.

09:37.330 --> 09:38.070
And we are going.

09:39.030 --> 09:47.370
And yeah, so I just moved doing the next fight and if we'll discuss how to optimize the memory of this

09:47.790 --> 09:48.060
pool.
