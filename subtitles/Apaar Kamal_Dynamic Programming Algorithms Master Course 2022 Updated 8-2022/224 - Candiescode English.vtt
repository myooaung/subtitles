WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.540
As I explained that we weren't perfect.

00:03.540 --> 00:10.590
Some of the we weren't not the perfect some might be warned barbarism of previous rule of the anime

00:10.590 --> 00:12.850
programming table that we are filling your DVD.

00:14.170 --> 00:21.090
If I want some summary some and what are the best complexity of having this are very some we can use

00:21.090 --> 00:25.740
segment driven weekly or if we are not updating it we use pretty big sums if you want.

00:25.740 --> 00:26.330
So very some.

00:26.940 --> 00:27.510
So what is.

00:28.860 --> 00:37.310
Some areas I'm from and this is basic if I'm not going into detail over there, what is a summary some

00:37.320 --> 00:38.810
from L2 out of ordinary?

00:38.820 --> 00:41.970
It is a question, but if it's de la minus.

00:41.970 --> 00:43.970
But if it's something l minus one.

00:43.980 --> 00:44.610
We all know that.

00:45.120 --> 00:50.040
Hey, so I'll utilize this property of prefix sum to find the summary.

00:50.040 --> 00:50.730
Some of this.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.450
Uh, cable.

00:53.450 --> 00:56.510
And in just one step, we will get all the values.

00:56.900 --> 00:57.090
Eight.

00:58.050 --> 00:58.710
So.

00:58.710 --> 00:59.010
Yeah.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.390
So let me come in this out.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.000
Let's come it and.

01:04.470 --> 01:08.700
Let's come in this altar and let's field the final two p values that we want to fill.

01:09.190 --> 01:10.260
Eight Similarly.

01:10.650 --> 01:12.450
So simply let's start.

01:13.360 --> 01:13.640
From.

01:13.660 --> 01:15.730
I goes to one and it's a feeling, Dylan.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.000
They will start from.

01:20.410 --> 01:22.000
So I've always said this.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.540
You do do it yourself, I say, then only watch this.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.070
Happening.

01:27.670 --> 01:33.530
The golden Kia, of course, didn't need to start from zero eight.

01:34.550 --> 01:37.310
Okay, now, guys, what's the next part?

01:37.640 --> 01:42.150
The next part is that people don't want to use this for a loop because it's a it's a suffix.

01:42.150 --> 01:42.440
So.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.060
Yeah, so big victim is the right word.

01:44.450 --> 01:45.210
It's a suffix.

01:45.210 --> 01:49.670
Some from this location to some particular location where it's ending.

01:50.930 --> 01:56.330
What I'll do is I simply say that if I want to find out a suffix, I'm to first of all, let's calculate

01:56.750 --> 01:58.720
the prefix some of the previous rate.

01:59.030 --> 02:00.710
Let's apply this.

02:03.010 --> 02:03.430
Okay.

02:04.090 --> 02:06.130
Let's move from zero to.

02:07.070 --> 02:08.100
You go look.

02:08.130 --> 02:10.170
And let's just say they're deep.

02:10.770 --> 02:11.060
Okay.

02:11.250 --> 02:12.750
Not from zero one.

02:14.060 --> 02:21.170
Will simply that BPI minus one day classic will still be a minus one day minus one.

02:21.560 --> 02:21.860
Why?

02:21.870 --> 02:27.920
Because this is normal traffic so not not much to worry about because already filled it with zero whatever

02:27.920 --> 02:30.050
the DB values have been filled for the previous row.

02:30.350 --> 02:34.040
I'm simply manipulating all those DPI values by picking up at a pixel.

02:35.070 --> 02:35.650
Well, yes.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.170
So it's a normal, perfect sum approach, not big deal.

02:39.380 --> 02:46.400
At this particular voluble lane 42 is actually taking the prefix some 40 above road that is going to

02:46.400 --> 02:48.500
be used for the current eight.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.360
And so what's the next fight here?

02:53.420 --> 02:53.990
The next fight?

02:53.990 --> 02:54.530
Is that okay?

02:54.530 --> 02:56.180
I need to look at NDP values.

02:56.810 --> 03:01.100
So, first of all, let's let's say that DP idea is equal to DP.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.500
A minus one day.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.000
Well, that means I'm saying, okay, that the current CPI is a value.

03:09.300 --> 03:14.640
Whatever it is, it is equal to whatever the prefix sum is or the above rule is this particular location

03:15.000 --> 03:21.600
and then ultimately so protected because all the debris somehow has to lie at the end position at the

03:22.710 --> 03:25.110
G eight at this particular G.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.930
Now, what I do is I simply say that if.

03:29.590 --> 03:31.110
G minus.

03:31.120 --> 03:39.160
Yeah that means okay it's limited has been exceeded that again this much cannot be given as the example

03:39.160 --> 03:41.710
that I've already given for deep.

03:43.630 --> 03:50.470
It for the big three comma for what we did was we if we gave him zero, then we have to be two, comma

03:50.710 --> 03:51.100
four.

03:51.430 --> 03:53.170
If we gave him one, we have to be two.

03:53.170 --> 03:54.550
Comma V.

03:54.550 --> 03:55.330
If we gave him.

03:56.330 --> 03:59.320
Do we have to be Goma, too?

03:59.780 --> 04:03.350
If we give him three, we have to be to Goma one.

04:04.070 --> 04:10.780
But as you can see, we don't have we are not using the two Gamma Zero vibe because its limit has exceeded.

04:10.790 --> 04:13.340
That means I can only give him three candies to do.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.930
I cannot give him for candies.

04:15.830 --> 04:16.750
I'm not using this.

04:16.760 --> 04:20.240
But here what I'm doing is I'm taking the whole prefix sum.

04:20.270 --> 04:27.320
So this prefix sum in the for the previous row and same column, it contains a bit of example zero for

04:27.320 --> 04:28.370
all of the row.

04:28.370 --> 04:28.640
Right.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.230
So in this I just need to subtract.

04:32.150 --> 04:32.340
Yeah.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.660
In this, I just need to subtract this.

04:35.660 --> 04:37.370
That is due to coma, you know.

04:37.370 --> 04:38.750
And so that's what I said.

04:38.750 --> 04:40.400
A summary some or a fix them.

04:41.240 --> 04:47.620
So what else I practice, I simply save J minus E that means what is the G value?

04:47.630 --> 04:49.460
It is four and what is the maximum?

04:49.460 --> 04:50.290
I can give him three.

04:50.530 --> 04:52.910
So if or minus it is greater than zero.

04:53.630 --> 04:54.170
That means.

04:56.810 --> 04:59.240
The total guarantees offered, and I can give him only three.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.730
I need to subject some particular part of the.

05:01.940 --> 05:06.860
But if some of the above rule or I'll do is I'll simply say it is greater than zero, then I simply

05:07.680 --> 05:08.960
need idea minus.

05:08.960 --> 05:14.810
He goes to DPA minus one day, minus eight, minus one.

05:16.000 --> 05:16.350
Will they?

05:16.450 --> 05:20.110
Because that's how wide this mine isn't because of.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.280
This thing.

05:23.480 --> 05:23.780
That.

05:25.030 --> 05:31.990
Prefix from Edward is equal to prefix of R minus the previous of L minus one eight because j minus eight

05:31.990 --> 05:33.910
needs to be included eight.

05:34.390 --> 05:39.580
That means four minus three in this case, and giving you an example side by side it for minus three

05:39.580 --> 05:45.010
needs to be included, which is equal to one, but for minus three, minus one, which is zero, should

05:45.010 --> 05:45.730
not be included.

05:46.740 --> 05:50.870
Late, but all of that perfect sum now has been subjected.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.740
So I am just getting the perfect sum of this.

05:52.950 --> 05:53.880
Somebody that I want.

05:55.230 --> 05:55.450
Cool.

05:56.220 --> 05:56.550
So.

05:58.270 --> 06:04.720
This was about this problem and still I won't get the right answer because I have not taken model attended

06:04.720 --> 06:05.500
by number seven.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.010
So let's take that now.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.110
It's an x rendered once.

06:09.890 --> 06:10.080
Yeah.

06:10.130 --> 06:11.130
I don't see any problems.

06:11.150 --> 06:12.140
So what's the final answer?

06:12.140 --> 06:13.460
The final answer is deep.

06:18.560 --> 06:18.830
Sorry.

06:18.830 --> 06:19.330
Anchor.

06:21.570 --> 06:22.820
Here it is for you in this case.

06:22.830 --> 06:23.220
Yes.

06:24.030 --> 06:25.620
Take for some of the cases once.

06:28.530 --> 06:29.730
We have zero for this case.

06:30.360 --> 06:30.660
It.

06:31.770 --> 06:37.110
And the thing is that we are optimizing dynamic programming by using dynamic programming.

06:37.170 --> 06:37.450
Okay.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.480
So what is the second inning programming this?

06:39.900 --> 06:40.890
It is prefix sense.

06:41.750 --> 06:42.010
Eight.

06:43.050 --> 06:44.250
What is the complexity of this?

06:44.250 --> 06:49.650
It is nw into Kee MALESKY because these are not nested.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.230
It is a.

06:52.440 --> 07:00.870
And into your black skin, which is and to give you this new kind of complexity to encase what we want.

07:01.350 --> 07:02.560
It will work it.

07:04.360 --> 07:04.660
Yeah.

07:04.780 --> 07:06.760
And of course, guys, this will not work because.

07:09.390 --> 07:10.920
It is exceeding a limit.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.840
And we want a small answer.

07:13.230 --> 07:14.070
Let's take Ahmad.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.030
You're still going to into the cold mode.

07:17.660 --> 07:19.550
It is Monday night in Bliss seven.

07:20.420 --> 07:25.790
And wherever we are doing the calculation, I will simply ignored the P.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.640
Let's not take it over here.

07:30.660 --> 07:33.000
Let's take it after this.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.670
Whenever the idea is being filled.

07:37.740 --> 07:38.160
eBay.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.320
Jay-Z goes to eBay.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.000
De Plus.

07:45.520 --> 07:51.010
MARTIN So as we are subtracting here, we need to like be careful because whenever we see a break,

07:51.010 --> 07:51.790
we add more.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.710
What I'm doing is I'm just taking more.

07:54.980 --> 07:57.380
So adding more and then again, I'll take more.

07:58.130 --> 08:02.610
That's a kind of easier way to do it, so I don't get confused.

08:02.690 --> 08:03.530
This is nothing.

08:03.530 --> 08:09.590
If if the values are negative, it will reduce the negative value to less than than new name b7 then

08:09.620 --> 08:10.430
will add more.

08:10.460 --> 08:13.790
It will give me something positive and then I'm going to take more wood.

08:14.150 --> 08:15.290
So this is kind of.

08:16.290 --> 08:18.300
Instead of taking individual every everybody.

08:18.310 --> 08:19.110
Just take one more.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.460
This type of model.

08:21.360 --> 08:21.610
Right.

08:21.990 --> 08:24.060
And we'll get the final answer.

08:26.100 --> 08:26.940
Is there a problem?

08:29.780 --> 08:30.600
The problem.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.290
I am filling the page here and not here.

08:35.230 --> 08:35.400
But.

08:38.270 --> 08:41.380
So six, six, five, 6326, eight, eight.

08:41.400 --> 08:41.680
Got it.

08:42.540 --> 08:43.830
The thing is, guys, that.

08:44.070 --> 08:45.390
Why am I not digging more over here?

08:45.390 --> 08:49.470
Because here I'm here, I'm adding it.

08:50.130 --> 08:56.010
And we all know that this deep A-minus on values already filled in the previous loop where I've already

08:56.010 --> 08:56.530
taken more.

08:56.550 --> 09:01.260
So the value will be less than ten db over nine, but seven if their values are less than ten to the

09:01.310 --> 09:04.310
over nine plus seven and I'm adding them how many times?

09:04.320 --> 09:05.940
GIDDINGS Four just ended above five.

09:05.940 --> 09:14.490
In the worst case, the value can exceed still standard about 48 and which is easy, which can easily

09:14.490 --> 09:17.910
be taken into integer type if you're not taking it then.

09:18.420 --> 09:22.230
So if you're not looking long, long into for long long, then you can.

09:23.810 --> 09:24.830
Ignored here also.

09:25.680 --> 09:31.530
Well, they let me copy and comment and pick.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.320
We're using the P.

09:36.300 --> 09:39.540
You optimize DP eight so that it works.

09:41.540 --> 09:41.710
Well.

09:41.870 --> 09:44.970
So here we have to speak right from here.

09:45.050 --> 09:49.580
We have started and we are still pondering the lamb and we have not got any wrong answers.

09:51.260 --> 09:54.890
So in the next five days, next problem.

09:55.250 --> 09:55.670
Thank you.
