WEBVTT

00:00.920 --> 00:05.630
Look, everyone, this is going to be the best problem of the course.

00:06.050 --> 00:11.700
And if you really want to deep dive into Red Mask, then this is the problem for you, right?

00:11.960 --> 00:18.590
So what else exist is why don't you just pause the video for a moment and try yourself at the very beginning?

00:18.600 --> 00:19.070
Of course.

00:19.070 --> 00:20.090
Continue to entertain.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.650
So let's read the problem.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.950
So consider the following problem.

00:25.270 --> 00:28.760
There's an elevator with maximum vertex pull.

00:28.970 --> 00:34.730
So I have upward legs given to me and people with nowhere to want to get from the ground floor to their

00:34.730 --> 00:35.420
top floor.

00:35.810 --> 00:41.780
What is the minimum number of lights needed if the people enter the elevator in an optimal order?

00:42.350 --> 00:42.920
Basically.

00:44.190 --> 00:45.750
I have some person over here.

00:45.780 --> 00:46.050
Let's see.

00:46.050 --> 00:47.550
Percent zero one, two, three, four.

00:47.550 --> 00:50.040
And we have their bid rates, which are different.

00:50.310 --> 00:51.570
Elevator has a fixed rate.

00:51.780 --> 00:57.870
This is a maximum their elevator can carry and go to the top floor rate.

00:58.290 --> 01:02.550
And what we want to do is we want to fit the people.

01:02.670 --> 01:09.570
We want to fit these persons in the elevator in such a way that the minimum number of rights are taken

01:09.570 --> 01:11.910
for them to reach to the top.

01:12.680 --> 01:18.090
Isn't this a very interesting problem and it can be realistically applied rate somewhere.

01:18.150 --> 01:22.950
Let's say the elevator is one and the lot of people want to go.

01:23.160 --> 01:26.760
You can quickly apply this and ask them to go in a certain order.

01:26.790 --> 01:27.120
Right.

01:27.990 --> 01:28.350
Okay.

01:28.740 --> 01:33.030
So what we can do here is I hope the problem statement is very clear.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.400
So what is the brute force approach?

01:35.880 --> 01:38.340
The brute force approach, as we all know for any.

01:40.070 --> 01:42.860
For any DP or DP with bitmaps.

01:42.860 --> 01:48.860
Wherever we apply, wherever we have these subsets, there are the basic approval approaches, the factorial

01:48.860 --> 01:49.580
approach, right?

01:49.850 --> 01:56.630
That means what I can do is I can try all possible five factorial options.

01:57.710 --> 02:01.370
And out of all those five vector options of what example or two, this was an option

02:01.760 --> 02:06.740
02432.

02:06.860 --> 02:07.120
Right.

02:07.130 --> 02:12.050
So let's see, this was one of those brute force factorial possibility.

02:12.260 --> 02:16.910
So in this, what I can do is if I want to find out the minimum number of rights they will take to reach

02:17.120 --> 02:24.140
the top because X is equal to 28 towards the weight of zero, it is to find what is the weight of one.

02:24.140 --> 02:27.200
It is three, it is five, it is less than ten.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.690
They can go in one lift.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.400
Now, what is the weight of four?

02:31.610 --> 02:32.900
It is six.

02:33.230 --> 02:35.360
So now I'll just say okay, zero.

02:35.360 --> 02:41.480
And when you go and for you weight you will go in the next trip because your weight is big, right?

02:41.660 --> 02:48.440
Means if you if I combine zero one and four, they will have a total of 11, which is exceeding my total

02:48.440 --> 02:48.920
weight of.

02:49.970 --> 02:50.300
The.

02:51.710 --> 02:52.130
Left.

02:52.850 --> 02:53.210
Right.

02:54.330 --> 02:54.990
The elevator.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.360
So now we know now for will start again.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.200
It will be six.

02:58.770 --> 03:00.120
Then what is a rate of three?

03:00.120 --> 03:00.840
It is five.

03:01.260 --> 03:04.020
So again, here we have a problem later.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.730
The weight of three is five.

03:06.030 --> 03:07.710
Now three cannot go with four.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.440
So now this is the second rate that we have done.

03:10.470 --> 03:13.590
Now the weight of three is five and the weight of two is three.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.030
So this is is eight.

03:15.450 --> 03:21.050
So in three rates, if they go in this order, it's zero one, four, three, two, one.

03:21.090 --> 03:27.870
If I want to test and take this solution in this order, trying all in factorial ways for all five factorial

03:27.870 --> 03:29.610
weights and using this approach.

03:30.390 --> 03:31.410
Let's start from first.

03:31.740 --> 03:36.180
If the weight is greater than x break, say you will go in the next part and start from zero again.

03:36.660 --> 03:40.340
In this way we can easily determine what is the minimum number of right rate.

03:40.590 --> 03:43.290
So what is the complexity of the solution that I get here?

03:43.290 --> 03:49.890
It is an factorial into n and factorial into n because and Victoria for all possible combinations and

03:49.890 --> 03:55.050
for taking rate, finding our dominion number of rate by applying these bars.

03:55.350 --> 03:55.650
Right.

03:56.580 --> 04:01.230
So we know and victory in the end is too much for us because we are going on to do programming.

04:01.230 --> 04:03.380
We want to do something in the best complexity.

04:03.390 --> 04:08.790
It's possible rate in factorial is of course never the best, best complexity.

04:09.480 --> 04:13.140
So now we will try to understand this how to use bit mask in this particular.

04:14.190 --> 04:21.990
Solution laid out how well it is BP will be mask is not actually bird mask it is deep on subset.

04:22.500 --> 04:22.830
Right.

04:23.040 --> 04:23.850
And that's absurd.

04:23.850 --> 04:25.170
Is optimizing with mass.

04:25.380 --> 04:25.740
Correct.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.230
So let's see how to break it down further.

04:28.620 --> 04:32.880
So basically what we want to do is we want to find out the particular subset.

04:33.360 --> 04:33.690
Right.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.570
So yeah.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.430
So we want to find out a particular subset.

04:40.050 --> 04:42.090
So how do we find that particular subset?

04:42.090 --> 04:42.360
Right.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.170
So here.

04:43.950 --> 04:44.250
Yeah.

04:44.430 --> 04:50.370
So, again, we think that this should be in order in which the people can go, right.

04:50.610 --> 04:58.530
So indirectly what we want is we want every one of them to reach every one of them to reach to the top.

04:58.950 --> 05:03.690
So basically it should be a fourth subset of its observed content.

05:03.690 --> 05:04.920
One, two, three, four, five.

05:05.700 --> 05:11.970
So every one of them will reach to the top and if this was the order.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.120
So basically, we want the particular order over here.

05:15.490 --> 05:15.750
Right.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.820
So how then how can we get an order?

05:17.850 --> 05:19.590
How can we figure out audiences?

05:19.950 --> 05:24.600
So for this particular F of something, what I'll do is I'll try to store two values.

05:24.930 --> 05:25.230
Right.

05:25.410 --> 05:30.660
Because we also want the weird and we also want the number of right here, here in this case, you can

05:30.660 --> 05:38.580
see them in your number of rights to how this is a particular order.

05:38.820 --> 05:42.450
Later in this, we can partition people into two right here.

05:42.690 --> 05:48.030
So 0 to 3 is one that is zero two and three that is two plus three plus five.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.370
So I got it perfect.

05:49.380 --> 05:53.640
And here and then we have three and six, which is nine.

05:53.730 --> 05:59.490
So here you can see if I go in these two groups, then in nine, we can we can just reach the top in

05:59.490 --> 06:01.950
just two possibilities in this two particular.

06:01.950 --> 06:02.340
Right.

06:02.970 --> 06:03.220
Right.

06:03.420 --> 06:05.370
So that is the optimal order.

06:06.210 --> 06:06.480
Cool.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.190
But how will I know that?

06:09.180 --> 06:11.630
What is the particular meaning number of 80?

06:11.880 --> 06:18.180
So for any of the deep values, I just try to find out that what is the minimum number of right.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.010
I figured out two things, right?

06:21.030 --> 06:24.450
So let's say F of something and let's see G of something.

06:25.700 --> 06:26.870
Because you.

06:28.230 --> 06:32.370
So I would simply say what if something I simply say the minimum rights minimum.

06:32.370 --> 06:32.820
Right.

06:36.370 --> 06:40.270
Minimum rates needed needed to reach.

06:42.700 --> 06:43.390
The top.

06:45.080 --> 06:45.500
With.

06:47.430 --> 06:53.310
As there is, as is the subset of the people rate instead of subsidized interest in zero one, two,

06:53.310 --> 06:55.110
three, four and more this year or something.

06:55.110 --> 07:00.480
I just see what is the minimum weight of the last rate.

07:01.050 --> 07:04.200
See, it's getting tricky rate of the last rate.

07:05.460 --> 07:05.910
That.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.830
Took place, right?

07:10.590 --> 07:15.180
So basically I have two things that I want to find out the minimum number of rights that needed, but

07:15.210 --> 07:18.690
to find out the minimum number of rights that are needed when I'll be performing the dance.

07:18.690 --> 07:25.020
And I also want to find out what was the what was the minimum weight that actually went up.

07:25.440 --> 07:25.790
Right.

07:25.800 --> 07:30.630
So that when I'm trying to add a person to my right, I can easily take that.

07:30.630 --> 07:36.090
Okay, if this was the minimum rate, then this person can be added in the same rate if this was not

07:36.090 --> 07:36.690
the minimum.

07:36.690 --> 07:42.420
But that means if the minimum wage plus whatever the weight of the person that I'm going to add is greater

07:42.420 --> 07:45.990
than X, that means that person has to start with the numerator.

07:46.860 --> 07:47.220
Correct.

07:48.270 --> 07:49.920
So what I can say is.

07:50.520 --> 07:50.800
Yeah.

07:52.390 --> 08:01.150
So let's see, I have this for a particular set s I have this f value and for that particular set for

08:01.150 --> 08:02.920
the particular themes that I have this g value.

08:03.460 --> 08:09.970
Before moving the alleged final words, let's find out what will the values of F of zero.

08:10.870 --> 08:16.270
If this set contains 0% only rate, that means one note would be taken.

08:17.460 --> 08:21.750
And what will be the U of 000 will be nothing but.

08:22.810 --> 08:28.360
The weight that is that was the minimum weight that went up from the last trade.

08:29.020 --> 08:34.780
So of course, Wiggins either only zero weight went up or only 0% went up.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.190
Then that means the weight was too.

08:37.130 --> 08:37.520
Correct.

08:38.000 --> 08:38.970
So, yeah.

08:39.740 --> 08:41.170
Let me shush.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.470
Make some more.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.080
Let's dive deeper into this.

08:45.230 --> 08:46.400
It's an interesting problem.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.610
So we have 0213.

08:51.300 --> 08:51.930
Two, three.

08:53.170 --> 08:57.910
And three, five, four, six, three, five, four, six.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.170
Let's stay a little deeper into this and that.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.770
Then you realize, like, how is the solution?

09:04.780 --> 09:06.280
Or might be working great.

09:07.030 --> 09:09.400
So we know what is effort zero.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.170
We know what is zero zero.

09:11.200 --> 09:15.850
Similarly, we can find out at four one and your find eight or we have over one.

09:16.330 --> 09:18.040
So one will go while taking one.

09:18.040 --> 09:18.280
Right?

09:18.760 --> 09:19.300
Predictable.

09:20.180 --> 09:22.970
It will go up and maturity of one, it will be three.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.980
So I have a quick question for you.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.710
Let's try to combine these elements.

09:28.130 --> 09:34.670
So let's see if I have F of zero, which is one, and I have G of zero, which is two.

09:34.850 --> 09:37.160
That is a minimum with zero to grade.

09:37.670 --> 09:43.220
Now I want I, now I want to find out what is F of zero one.

09:45.120 --> 09:45.480
Correct.

09:45.690 --> 09:48.990
And what is your 018?

09:49.290 --> 09:52.500
So if I want to find out what is F4 zero one, what does it mean?

09:52.550 --> 09:56.630
There are this set of zero and one.

09:56.670 --> 09:57.270
Tell me.

09:57.390 --> 10:00.210
Okay, let me alternate F of one, which is one again.

10:00.210 --> 10:03.230
And what is the of the of when it is three.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.480
The last word that was carried up very not.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.890
Tell me if.

10:08.280 --> 10:08.540
Yeah.

10:08.550 --> 10:10.200
If I want to write naught F of zero one.

10:10.710 --> 10:11.790
That means what is the.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.320
Minimum rate that is used.

10:16.560 --> 10:17.400
If I want to get it.

10:18.120 --> 10:25.050
So what I can do is I can say adder find out the answer for one and and zero two it zero two.

10:25.590 --> 10:26.190
Same rate.

10:27.400 --> 10:27.790
Correct.

10:28.060 --> 10:32.730
Or I can see if I know the answer for one egg.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.510
Zero to New Road.

10:35.440 --> 10:35.770
Correct.

10:35.920 --> 10:44.290
So, for example, for this subset, that is the subset of one, let's say the there was five rates,

10:44.560 --> 10:44.810
right?

10:44.860 --> 10:46.990
In this case, we can easily see it's one night only.

10:47.170 --> 10:48.600
So I have just two options, right?

10:48.610 --> 10:52.360
If I want to add a particular element that is zero.

10:52.930 --> 10:58.360
What are those two options that I have add that include them into the same rate in which the previous

10:58.360 --> 11:01.480
subsequent paid and or exclude them.

11:01.870 --> 11:02.230
Correct.

11:02.470 --> 11:04.750
So when will I include them and when we'll exclude them?

11:04.750 --> 11:06.220
I can simply say if.

11:07.480 --> 11:15.400
G of one Martinsville one the minimum wage that went up when one was going rate when only this particular

11:15.400 --> 11:18.070
set was going in the last three that it took.

11:18.520 --> 11:22.270
Just remember, it's always about the last trip.

11:22.270 --> 11:25.440
Not the total trip, not the total weight, just the last trip.

11:25.780 --> 11:26.030
Right?

11:26.140 --> 11:32.970
So if g of this, the third of which I want the answer for if g of one bless the current rate.

11:32.980 --> 11:35.320
That is the weight of the zeroth element, which is two.

11:35.650 --> 11:38.740
So if you want us to is less than equal to x.

11:40.560 --> 11:40.770
Right.

11:40.990 --> 11:45.280
That means in the previous eight one event, what was the minimum wage for the raid?

11:45.910 --> 11:48.190
Giovanni Giovanni's three.

11:48.520 --> 11:48.850
Correct.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.180
So if three plus two is less, then equals two x, which is ten and we all know it, then I can include

11:55.180 --> 11:56.650
zero into the same rate.

11:56.980 --> 12:04.810
Or what I will do is if this is not true, that means d of one plus two is not is greater than ten.

12:04.810 --> 12:10.750
That means if there's a case when I'm adding a new element to the set and I see that, okay, not this

12:11.020 --> 12:12.190
particular person.

12:12.310 --> 12:15.250
This particular person should go in a new right because.

12:16.430 --> 12:17.630
The last rate went up.

12:18.110 --> 12:22.100
Now, if I'm if I want to add a human to the last rate, it is taking a more.

12:23.600 --> 12:23.930
It is.

12:23.930 --> 12:24.320
It is.

12:24.530 --> 12:29.390
The weight of the right is getting more than if the weight of the rate is getting more then x, then

12:29.390 --> 12:30.080
we will simply.

12:31.140 --> 12:37.110
Say that it is a new ride and now the new weight is the weight of this new person that is ready because

12:37.110 --> 12:38.030
now he's going alone.

12:38.040 --> 12:38.490
He's not.

12:38.490 --> 12:40.140
I didn't do the previous rate.

12:40.590 --> 12:40.830
Right.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.610
So, okay, let me analyze it instead of that.

12:44.620 --> 12:53.710
I simply say that f off I have some f office and I have geophys rate to calculate f off as plus a particular

12:53.710 --> 12:54.550
value ex.

12:56.030 --> 12:59.540
That means now in this attack is at this element.

12:59.960 --> 13:04.040
At this point, the Knicks tried to add him into the act.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.030
So there are two options.

13:05.420 --> 13:10.880
First, same X goes in previous raid.

13:12.680 --> 13:13.550
Previous rate.

13:14.090 --> 13:15.770
That means in this case.

13:18.370 --> 13:24.250
The answer will be whatever is f f of x plus this x.

13:24.250 --> 13:28.060
Okay, let me deal with plus x because we will be computing them simultaneously.

13:28.810 --> 13:35.050
So F of x plus this x will be same for face because if he is going in the previous write only that means

13:35.050 --> 13:41.800
the number of right is same and this is only possible if g office plus the current person's weight.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.590
That is weight of x.

13:45.660 --> 13:49.680
Is less xenical strict oral weight which is also so don't get confused.

13:49.950 --> 13:51.970
Instead let me write instead of x.

13:51.990 --> 13:53.220
Let me take by here.

13:53.760 --> 13:57.630
Why is the new person that I want to add into the current state?

13:57.960 --> 13:59.550
Eight So let me advise her.

14:00.060 --> 14:07.980
So y y goods in the previous aid which is only possible if of s that means the last word that went into

14:07.980 --> 14:14.310
the last rate of the same say plus the weight of the current element or the current person is less than

14:14.310 --> 14:15.630
equal to x eight.

14:15.870 --> 14:18.270
So FISA will be this and what will be no.

14:18.390 --> 14:22.980
So d of x plus y will be nothing but.

14:24.020 --> 14:26.660
Geofence because now I'm adding human to the same light.

14:27.110 --> 14:30.130
So it becomes your office plus made of white.

14:31.030 --> 14:31.390
Correct.

14:31.810 --> 14:34.840
And the second possibility is why goes in.

14:36.180 --> 14:36.720
New rate.

14:37.780 --> 14:38.020
New.

14:38.410 --> 14:47.860
And this this will only be true if you can only go into a new rate of if GSP+ weight of VI is greater

14:47.860 --> 14:51.790
than x eight, that means the last rate.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.870
The last rate rate plus the current rate.

14:55.870 --> 14:57.790
The current elements rate of it is greater than ex.

14:57.790 --> 15:00.010
Then that means it cannot go into the current rate.

15:00.310 --> 15:05.920
So efforts will be nothing but efforts plus five, eliminating benefits plus one because he's going

15:05.920 --> 15:09.640
into because now we have a new rate for this new guy and.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.950
What will be your essay?

15:13.550 --> 15:20.780
It will be nothing but a weight off by my weight of I because not this represents the new rate.

15:20.890 --> 15:21.220
Correct.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.030
Displacement means it's a new rate.

15:23.240 --> 15:27.110
It means I'm going in this rate from the elevator again.

15:27.470 --> 15:29.270
And this area only contains five.

15:30.860 --> 15:37.190
Correct to add that the word will be added or the word will be the new word for the new edit.

15:38.330 --> 15:41.060
So I hope you got this recursive relation in the next part.

15:41.060 --> 15:41.660
We'll call it.

15:42.050 --> 15:43.580
So what will be the base case here?

15:43.590 --> 15:44.300
What will be?

15:45.550 --> 15:48.820
F of zero.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.360
And a g of zero.

15:51.630 --> 15:53.010
So we can say above zero is one.

15:53.010 --> 15:59.430
That means if it's empty and we want only the lift to go up without any weight, that means it will

15:59.430 --> 16:00.620
take exactly 188.

16:00.810 --> 16:06.590
So if I add one, that means let's m adding the 0% into the set eight.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.130
So this is not zero.

16:08.280 --> 16:11.240
This is empty fight, right?

16:12.030 --> 16:17.550
So if I'm adding the 0% into the set, that means he will go in one night only because the weight of

16:17.550 --> 16:18.780
five is also zero eight.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.270
But the 0% can be added into this.

16:21.270 --> 16:21.620
Right.

16:21.630 --> 16:23.040
That was going empty right now.

16:24.100 --> 16:24.940
They look good.

16:25.330 --> 16:28.330
So assume the next part and then we'll go this particular problem.
