00:00.970 --> 00:01.550
Everyone.

00:02.130 --> 00:04.400
Welcome to the follow problem of the tiling problem.

00:04.400 --> 00:07.250
Let's call it tiling problem soup.

00:08.020 --> 00:11.800
Well, it's just another variation of it and.

00:13.050 --> 00:17.230
It's man, it's self-made basically in this.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.570
What is the new trick?

00:18.810 --> 00:23.980
Well, of course, you cross in to fill all the growth in and the.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.510
The new thing here is that I have added a new title.

00:28.140 --> 00:28.910
This is a new day.

00:30.870 --> 00:36.840
The first one is one cross to the second Ellis to Grossman and the third Ellis to cross to.

00:37.560 --> 00:41.370
That means I can fill all of this by using one.

00:43.780 --> 00:45.850
Well, now let's see how to do this.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.540
Before that, I would suggest you do pause the video.

00:49.570 --> 00:50.710
Think about it yourself.

00:51.110 --> 00:51.420
I'd.

00:52.760 --> 01:00.440
The thing about how I think about the solution that I told you earlier, the approach to fill one column

01:00.440 --> 01:04.370
only is a number of ways of filling one column and then figure out the next.

01:06.140 --> 01:08.040
So the first part is very clear.

01:08.060 --> 01:11.660
If I was part, if I place.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.250
You cross one daily, like vertically.

01:17.330 --> 01:19.670
Basically we have already seen the data.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.730
It is because we have employed having to go through often minus one.

01:22.790 --> 01:23.540
The first part.

01:23.660 --> 01:25.130
The second part is very simple.

01:25.130 --> 01:30.440
Again, if I place two days horizontally, which is F in minus two.

01:31.010 --> 01:31.880
Now what about.

01:32.950 --> 01:35.300
Filling the first column with the third type.

01:35.380 --> 01:37.770
Let me quickly write this out.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.120
One grows two tiles horizontally.

01:43.280 --> 01:45.350
So this is the solar and is it this one?

01:46.700 --> 01:48.290
Now, I have deterred that.

01:48.950 --> 01:54.020
How can I use the turtle to fill the first column immediately by placing their tailgate?

01:54.470 --> 01:56.000
If I place the third Tyler.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.020
Which is the complete.

02:00.740 --> 02:01.510
Then what do I have?

02:01.520 --> 02:05.900
If this wasn't, then if this was f.n, then this is.

02:07.610 --> 02:09.680
F and minus you again.

02:10.580 --> 02:10.860
Eight.

02:10.970 --> 02:13.490
So what I ultimately do, I simply say a little bit.

02:14.350 --> 02:15.030
Even managed to.

02:16.420 --> 02:19.930
This is the third approach by placing a two cross to tell.

02:21.450 --> 02:24.330
You just remember, just fill the first column completely.

02:24.630 --> 02:28.430
You get all the different number of ways of filling the first column completely, and you will find

02:28.460 --> 02:29.480
out eight.

02:30.060 --> 02:36.990
And so what I have got it is it goes to F in sorry, f and minus one less doing different minus two.

02:38.420 --> 02:41.420
I hope the second part of the problem is very clear.

02:41.590 --> 02:47.450
They will just fill the first column with different number of is eight and then figure out the recursive

02:47.450 --> 02:47.870
operation.

02:49.070 --> 02:52.160
And the next problem that is telling problem three.

02:52.430 --> 02:55.490
And it is so interesting that it's it's very interesting.

02:55.490 --> 03:01.190
And if you solve the problem, then you will have to solve a follow a problem of that problem that I'll

03:01.190 --> 03:02.980
tell you after the accident.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.240
Well, so let's start Linux problem.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.660
I'm actually excited to solve the next problem I think you.
