00:00.980 --> 00:01.430
Everyone.

00:01.520 --> 00:03.380
So let's do this next problem.

00:04.360 --> 00:09.550
Which is coins from the Admiralty bygone days, of course.

00:11.400 --> 00:11.730
Yeah.

00:12.340 --> 00:16.760
So the problem is he admitted that it can be a positive number.

00:16.770 --> 00:24.880
So our number especially mentioned there and going to number one by one twin and for each I, when I,

00:24.930 --> 00:29.650
when I is lost, it comes up paired with the plurality of VAT.

00:29.670 --> 00:35.550
So the plurality of so basically by just going out and based on the way the world would have been one

00:35.550 --> 00:36.060
by two.

00:36.720 --> 00:42.390
Then the properties PPA and deals with probability of one minus v eight.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.890
We have been given an edit of Linton for every I get going.

00:46.890 --> 00:53.220
We have plural LIPA which is given to us, which is probability of head eight who throw his stores all

00:53.220 --> 00:53.880
the end coins.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.700
Find forward of having more heads then it's.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.110
Cool.

00:58.650 --> 01:03.600
So input and output is still stored at a should not be greater than ten to the bone nine.

01:03.600 --> 01:08.100
So we should we have to bring answer to the best of ten to the bottom nine places.

01:08.990 --> 01:09.230
He.

01:10.360 --> 01:14.620
Accurately the nine digits after the decimal.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.000
It's a different point.

01:17.030 --> 01:17.340
Yeah.

01:17.670 --> 01:22.640
So what does he say that find the probability of having more heads than.

01:23.720 --> 01:24.140
It's.

01:27.430 --> 01:34.180
So a very simple problem is what will the burden of having more and then pills.

01:35.290 --> 01:37.840
Let's think from the basic bamboo.

01:39.860 --> 01:46.970
It to be had 11.8 so we have 11 going to be no the properties of heads and tails eight.

01:47.660 --> 01:49.880
So how many heads do I want?

01:50.720 --> 01:54.890
I want at least what is buried of having more heads.

01:54.890 --> 01:55.910
Bent is eight.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.910
I want more head then tails and and is odd.

01:59.570 --> 02:01.340
Basically, I can have six heads.

02:01.850 --> 02:02.510
Five tails.

02:03.710 --> 02:12.020
Seven heads or tails it heads you detailed nine heads or tails and then heads, one tails, all 11.

02:12.230 --> 02:13.430
It's eight.

02:13.730 --> 02:14.970
Let's see an example.

02:14.970 --> 02:15.800
Here we have three.

02:17.800 --> 02:22.240
It is 0.3, 0.6 and 0.8.

02:22.240 --> 02:28.330
So we have triple release of all the coins of heads, eight really of heads for three.

02:28.330 --> 02:32.080
What we're going to have is we're going to have at most two heads and one below.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.780
Or what we can have is we can have.

02:36.820 --> 02:37.570
All traits.

02:39.580 --> 02:39.910
So.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.560
So how can we have these two heads and wonders?

02:45.100 --> 02:46.600
So here's a normal example.

02:47.170 --> 02:48.950
We're going to have three, eight and eight.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.910
So either we have two heads, literally, and one tail, or we have to add all we have to it.

02:55.430 --> 02:58.710
Basically, we're going to have this in three V's, right?

02:58.750 --> 03:03.040
Which is actually to church and it's Stitch.

03:04.140 --> 03:08.280
So we have these four ways in which we can have more heads and tools.

03:08.670 --> 03:12.480
And then we finally have to sum all these priorities and bring down the.

03:13.540 --> 03:19.930
Well, the explanation is enough, I guess, and it's a very simple problem.

03:21.050 --> 03:25.490
So how do you find the records in relation of this age to as I already told you.

03:25.850 --> 03:33.830
What we do is we first of all later state it let's make a state and let's to the states is f of a comma.

03:36.030 --> 03:37.190
It's okay.

03:37.860 --> 03:39.630
So all we can do is.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.080
If I go mix it, it means.

03:49.610 --> 03:49.940
That.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.030
Yeah.

03:52.260 --> 04:00.300
Let's take a third variable and in this tutorial you'll learn one new thing that you don't have to always.

04:00.300 --> 04:05.430
Memory is all the arguments in this to get an extra variable, an eraser to the end.

04:05.880 --> 04:12.780
Let's say I Etsuko might be full, but it is that out of the available icons.

04:13.290 --> 04:15.600
I want these maniacs and these magnitudes.

04:16.200 --> 04:16.520
Eight.

04:16.830 --> 04:18.300
What is the probability?

04:19.760 --> 04:20.570
Probability.

04:29.320 --> 04:30.280
Of Egypt.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.860
And it deals.

04:36.300 --> 04:37.320
If I have.

04:39.650 --> 04:40.460
I have.

04:42.330 --> 04:42.900
Coins.

04:43.840 --> 04:44.350
From?

04:44.710 --> 04:45.280
I do.

04:47.880 --> 04:48.160
Eight.

04:49.050 --> 04:51.600
Basically, it is 85 some suffix of coins.

04:51.600 --> 04:57.300
And I want these many heads from those coins and these many days from those coins, then what's the

04:57.300 --> 04:58.020
probability?

04:58.680 --> 04:59.000
Right.

04:59.430 --> 05:04.530
So basically the final answer should be F of zero comma.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.150
It should be looked at.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.980
It should have into eight.

05:10.490 --> 05:12.970
So it can then vary rate.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.690
So let's say it moves from.

05:16.950 --> 05:21.360
And my two plus one, my M.S. and plus one because we won Morehead State.

05:21.360 --> 05:26.790
So if end is our number, so it becomes 11 by two plus one, right?

05:27.330 --> 05:30.870
So it's from and by two plus one to win eight.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.030
So the answer is submission of.

05:33.910 --> 05:37.330
F of zero, which is let's start from the other index.

05:37.330 --> 05:41.140
We have all the coins right now and how many heads we want.

05:41.140 --> 05:45.700
We want each heads and each is going from where to place, when and how many days we have.

05:46.120 --> 05:51.090
So if I have a church then and minus edge will be number of is eight.

05:51.340 --> 05:53.440
So it symbolizes that.

05:54.570 --> 05:57.180
What Leslie will find.

05:57.180 --> 06:03.890
Answer for this is F of zero and by two plus one, comma and minus and by two +18.

06:04.340 --> 06:08.310
So tell me if I have all the points and what is the probability of getting these many heads and these

06:08.310 --> 06:09.420
many kids?

06:10.200 --> 06:15.660
Eight So how can I find this probability of getting some number of heads and some number of tails?

06:16.580 --> 06:19.200
So there are two transitions always, right?

06:19.200 --> 06:23.730
So for any element, i.e. which is like let's say I want the zeroth element first.

06:23.730 --> 06:26.820
So I always do transitions, what are the transitions?

06:27.060 --> 06:29.220
And that it is flipped held or it is flipped?

06:29.490 --> 06:30.660
It's nothing.

06:30.660 --> 06:31.400
It's eight.

06:31.770 --> 06:38.280
So if it is flipped here then it is simply pay into FFI plus one and it is flipped.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.230
And then what does it become?

06:40.260 --> 06:40.800
Let me.

06:45.210 --> 06:46.470
At anti rate.

06:46.470 --> 06:52.140
So what does add to become it edge becomes h minus one because we have got ahead and built into it as

06:52.140 --> 06:55.710
it is or I tell which is one minus V into.

06:57.490 --> 06:58.090
F off.

06:59.010 --> 07:05.550
I presume that from the remaining from the remaining coins, just give me a church and B minus one tails

07:05.550 --> 07:09.600
because I have lived it is pointed and these are only applicable.

07:09.630 --> 07:14.700
So this is only applicable when when I have number of heads remaining, that means head should be greater

07:14.700 --> 07:15.210
than zero.

07:15.420 --> 07:17.010
And this is only applicable when.

07:18.690 --> 07:23.370
I have to intermeeting, which is easier to then, you know, and I'll sum this for all the heads.

07:23.910 --> 07:24.130
Eight.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.160
So what are the heads that I can have?

07:26.160 --> 07:28.310
And two plus one and two plus two and so on.

07:28.320 --> 07:33.270
So for 11 I can have six, seven, eight, nine, ten and 11 it.

07:33.720 --> 07:40.110
What all these are we all kind of write a basic recursive solution and then we'll try to memorize it.

07:40.500 --> 07:40.980
So let's.

07:42.470 --> 07:43.910
Put it in the next part.

07:44.330 --> 07:45.740
Oh, you wait.
