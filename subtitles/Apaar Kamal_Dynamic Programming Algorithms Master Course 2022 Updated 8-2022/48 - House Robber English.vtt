00:01.000 --> 00:07.930
I have driven let's all a very interesting problem, which is how ultrabook as you can guess that it

00:07.930 --> 00:13.690
has so many lakes and many to this lakes and the ratio of the lakes to this lake is one of the best

00:13.690 --> 00:14.290
on the record.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.540
This is a very interesting problem.

00:16.990 --> 00:23.020
And this problem, milieus are dynamic programming, of course, but it's a it's actually a very easy

00:23.020 --> 00:23.410
problem.

00:24.010 --> 00:28.660
But what I want I want I will actually confuse you all in this problem.

00:28.660 --> 00:33.820
I want to confuse you in this problem, because I want you to understand two different ways of solving

00:33.820 --> 00:34.090
this.

00:35.620 --> 00:38.110
So therefore, I'll slightly confuse you.

00:38.110 --> 00:42.020
But then we'll come back and see why is that working on.

00:42.070 --> 00:43.540
So let's read the problem first.

00:44.170 --> 00:48.130
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along the street.

00:48.850 --> 00:52.540
Each house has a certain amount of money stashed.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.000
These are there's a money in the houses.

00:55.570 --> 01:01.270
The only constant stopping you from the robbing each of them is that at the end, houses have security

01:01.270 --> 01:06.910
system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into

01:06.910 --> 01:07.480
the same night.

01:08.140 --> 01:09.250
Basically simple.

01:10.030 --> 01:16.810
You cannot break in and break into two decent houses in the same at the same time.

01:17.230 --> 01:22.030
So if you are picking, i.e. you cannot bring into a policeman and you cannot break into A-minus for

01:22.270 --> 01:28.180
not do it the same basically in D do that in them sort of presenting the amount of money of each house

01:28.220 --> 01:32.650
return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

01:33.070 --> 01:34.510
They begin scene one, two, three, four.

01:34.510 --> 01:39.520
We cannot take two or three continuously, but we can take this one and this trigger continuously.

01:39.820 --> 01:41.830
Also, we can take this one and this one also.

01:41.830 --> 01:42.160
Right.

01:42.790 --> 01:44.260
Because they are not continuous.

01:44.260 --> 01:45.490
And we can take this to.

01:47.110 --> 01:47.800
And this one.

01:48.460 --> 01:48.670
Correct.

01:49.450 --> 01:49.840
So.

01:52.080 --> 01:52.380
Right.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.810
But this was example one.

01:54.810 --> 01:58.630
And similarly, you can see the best answer this one, bless you, which is full.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.160
The second one is 27931.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.290
So we cannot take seven and nine continuously.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.640
We cannot take nine and three continuously, but we can take two nine.

02:09.410 --> 02:13.370
And one verdict, that's the best answer you need.

02:13.370 --> 02:16.790
So I feel free to pause the video and use.

02:17.150 --> 02:23.630
I said It's very easy if you've read if you had read this part of the course where you have understood

02:23.630 --> 02:27.680
how it does when the problem works, then you can easily solve it.

02:28.370 --> 02:30.560
So let's discuss this problem in more detail.

02:31.430 --> 02:34.790
So these are the indexes and these are the values.

02:34.790 --> 02:36.740
Instead of values, read nums.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.030
Well, so.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.250
Variety.

02:42.030 --> 02:47.070
I'll make a state in both state and I'll simply say Idbi comma.

02:47.610 --> 02:50.480
If you make a to restated i committee.

02:50.520 --> 02:50.880
Right.

02:52.530 --> 02:53.820
Right now I'm taking it to restate.

02:53.820 --> 02:55.680
But we will see how to reduce it.

02:55.680 --> 03:00.690
Like reduce this to the state, to our needs to it will represent.

03:02.730 --> 03:05.610
What's the maximum amount of money?

03:08.710 --> 03:10.780
Money you can Rob.

03:14.530 --> 03:15.190
From.

03:18.100 --> 03:18.640
Let's see.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.300
The houses are houses.

03:23.610 --> 03:24.360
I do.

03:24.620 --> 03:31.170
Being basically the subject of debate will represent if I have these many houses starting from the end

03:31.770 --> 03:33.780
of the max amount of money you can draw up.

03:34.110 --> 03:37.530
If if j zero then.

03:37.530 --> 03:41.250
But what I will say is that we will simply say that the houses.

03:43.470 --> 03:43.860
Robbed.

03:44.610 --> 03:46.200
It means the eight houses robbed.

03:46.290 --> 03:47.310
And if just one.

03:47.860 --> 03:48.290
Okay.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.670
Let's say for the related, the house is not robbed.

03:52.710 --> 03:52.950
Yeah.

03:53.070 --> 03:56.850
As I said, I'll make it slightly confusing, but this is important.

03:57.210 --> 03:59.070
It will come in handy later.

03:59.790 --> 04:03.840
House is robbed, so there's a very simple, easy solution.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.100
But I don't want to go into that.

04:05.460 --> 04:06.810
We will come to that later.

04:07.890 --> 04:10.590
And here we can see that this is deep, easy.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.600
Houses are from eye to end.

04:13.290 --> 04:13.830
Very simple.

04:14.040 --> 04:17.400
So for any house, deep zero represents.

04:17.940 --> 04:19.080
What's the best answer?

04:19.140 --> 04:19.500
If.

04:21.250 --> 04:22.960
I'm not robbing the current house.

04:23.170 --> 04:24.430
I'm not robbing the current house.

04:24.670 --> 04:25.780
These are the total houses.

04:25.810 --> 04:27.040
Tell me, what's the best answer?

04:27.380 --> 04:28.030
Second is.

04:28.970 --> 04:31.640
If I am robbing, they got to know that is DBA.

04:31.640 --> 04:36.600
Even for DBA, when will tell me what's the best answer if I'm robbing the current state?

04:36.850 --> 04:38.270
What will be the final answer?

04:39.340 --> 04:42.280
Basically the final answer will be nothing but max off of BP.

04:43.670 --> 04:44.360
Zero zero.

04:45.520 --> 04:52.390
Commanded b018 that means Rob defy styles are doing Robert tell me what's the best answer for all the

04:52.390 --> 04:59.110
Oasis eight So I hope you understood the deep state here, but that these deep states mean I0 even.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.050
Now let's try to make some.

05:03.940 --> 05:04.380
Nations.

05:05.230 --> 05:05.450
Okay.

05:06.290 --> 05:07.540
So think about it.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.540
That's him not robbing the current house.

05:11.990 --> 05:15.380
Hey, if I'm not robbing the government house, that means I can rob the next house.

05:15.860 --> 05:17.960
So, basically, let me see.

05:18.380 --> 05:18.620
Yeah.

05:18.860 --> 05:19.280
So let's see.

05:19.310 --> 05:20.930
These many houses they wanted to rob.

05:20.930 --> 05:23.900
And currently I'm here and I'm saying I'm not robbing the current house.

05:23.900 --> 05:28.040
Tell me, what's the best answer for the rest of the house is what are the rest of the houses?

05:28.220 --> 05:30.860
It starts from index next index basically rate.

05:30.860 --> 05:35.570
So I can simply say that I'm not only corinthos, then the answer will be nothing but.

05:36.620 --> 05:39.920
You can either rob the next house or you can not rob the next house.

05:40.790 --> 05:46.280
So in this case, what I can say is, once again, we the max off and then you rob the next house,

05:46.280 --> 05:48.530
which is DP zero.

05:49.740 --> 05:59.290
Sorry DP I +10 which is if you don't robbed in Texas and the next one is BPI plus one comma one --.

05:59.730 --> 06:01.020
You robbed the next jobs.

06:01.470 --> 06:03.890
I hope this is very clear to them not having to go.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.020
And you can rob the next house.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.500
You can not rob next year.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.600
Depends on you.

06:08.610 --> 06:08.940
Right?

06:09.420 --> 06:13.770
Whether not robbing the next house gives you a better solution or robbing the next rose gives you a

06:13.770 --> 06:14.490
better solution.

06:14.930 --> 06:19.750
Eric For example, let's say this is the case 1 to 10 and two, right?

06:20.190 --> 06:21.090
So in this case.

06:22.270 --> 06:27.070
What's happening is it's not necessary to rob the next house and get the best, best answer.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.440
I can not Robert and still obtain the state.

06:30.100 --> 06:30.420
Correct.

06:32.210 --> 06:39.590
So let's go to the next third, which is DP, i.e. comma one, which means if I'm robbing the current

06:39.590 --> 06:41.090
house, what's my best answer?

06:41.120 --> 06:42.530
So if I'm robbing the current house.

06:42.530 --> 06:45.140
Didn't tell me while I robbed the next house.

06:45.560 --> 06:45.790
No.

06:45.800 --> 06:45.960
Right.

06:45.980 --> 06:47.450
I cannot rob the next house.

06:47.700 --> 06:51.130
So my answer is nothing but DPA +10.

06:51.140 --> 06:51.650
That means.

06:51.890 --> 06:52.550
Now tell me.

06:53.990 --> 06:57.360
That was the best answer for the other houses.

06:57.380 --> 07:00.690
If I don't rob the next house so I'm robbing the current house.

07:00.710 --> 07:06.110
I will also include number eight because that cash, I'm digging it.

07:06.260 --> 07:10.490
So these are the basic recursive relations that we have formed.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.350
And this is a working solution.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.390
If you want to try it, you can call it and submitted.

07:14.390 --> 07:17.690
And finally, you just need to return max of DP zero comma.

07:20.410 --> 07:20.770
Correct.

07:20.920 --> 07:24.160
And a deep zero comma, one that Europe defers to all.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.000
So you don't draw it.

07:25.030 --> 07:25.900
What's the best answer?

07:26.530 --> 07:31.960
But here, I just want you to realize one more thing that this is a 2D dynamic programming solution,

07:32.140 --> 07:35.840
because here we have two states, either Robert or you don't Robert.

07:36.400 --> 07:40.120
But then this can be converted to a 1D writing programming solution.

07:40.120 --> 07:44.470
Let's see how far deep by even what I have is I have DBA +10.

07:44.480 --> 07:44.740
Right?

07:45.070 --> 07:48.670
So let me just replace I plus one in this equation eight.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.770
So what will be the DBA +10.

07:51.780 --> 07:52.830
It will be nothing but.

07:55.070 --> 07:55.910
Max off.

07:56.940 --> 07:57.510
BP.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.090
I blessed to because I'm replacing your day.

08:00.240 --> 08:03.150
I bless one former BP.

08:04.070 --> 08:05.510
I blessed two former.

08:06.580 --> 08:06.940
One.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.210
Correct.

08:08.930 --> 08:15.230
Well, I've done nothing, but I just replaced eBay plus one in the first equation just to find out

08:15.230 --> 08:16.700
the value of DPA plus one.

08:17.450 --> 08:18.370
So here I hear you.

08:18.510 --> 08:19.760
You all concede that.

08:20.660 --> 08:20.870
Yeah.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.330
This is the greater good in that regard.

08:23.570 --> 08:26.750
Look, I can also say that DPA is equal to Dubai.

08:26.770 --> 08:30.650
I is also equal to this Max of BP.

08:31.730 --> 08:37.640
I plus two, comma, zero, comma deep plus Tacoma one.

08:38.240 --> 08:38.720
Correct.

08:38.720 --> 08:43.640
And now let's just for a moment, let's just forget this.

08:44.640 --> 08:45.540
That can exist.

08:45.540 --> 08:49.730
And let's say we have the first equation, which is BPI zero and the second decreasing, and those are

08:49.740 --> 08:50.320
deep even.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.830
But again, this is also working solution, right?

08:53.160 --> 08:54.030
But now let's see.

08:54.240 --> 09:00.030
Instead of saying that whether I selected, then tell me the answer and if I don't selected, then tell

09:00.030 --> 09:00.540
me the answer.

09:00.780 --> 09:01.770
What we can say is.

09:02.780 --> 09:04.220
Tell me the answer if I.

09:05.250 --> 09:11.160
And they're selected or I don't selected eight So just tell me what is the maximum money that is stashed

09:11.160 --> 09:12.870
if I selected or if I don't selected?

09:13.470 --> 09:20.820
So right now what we can see is let's make deep eye and let's not include zero one and let's say that

09:20.820 --> 09:26.070
DPA is nothing but is it is equals to max of epi i.e. zero.

09:28.930 --> 09:31.180
Bomber, my DP, Ivan.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.850
Okay, so let's take a third step.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.440
And this is a windy state, which is not doing DPA, and it will represent the max of, as I take it,

09:41.440 --> 09:41.950
or I don't.

09:42.130 --> 09:47.050
Tell me, what's the best answer I know if I'm taking it or if I'm not taking it, tell me what's the

09:47.050 --> 09:47.620
best answer?

09:47.620 --> 09:48.790
This is what DP.

09:48.790 --> 09:50.440
I will represent Nate.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.060
So here you can see that.

09:53.220 --> 09:54.240
What is this?

09:54.270 --> 09:59.220
This is nothing but liberalism combined rate this whole max value.

09:59.910 --> 10:01.220
It is deep, blissful, right?

10:01.290 --> 10:05.150
And this whole max values BPI bliss to addict.

10:05.340 --> 10:10.350
So what I will simply say is I simply say that BPI is nothing but.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.480
Max off.

10:14.050 --> 10:15.690
Because here you can see that.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.310
Okay, let me write it completely.

10:18.310 --> 10:18.880
Only then.

10:19.240 --> 10:19.510
Yeah.

10:21.290 --> 10:21.530
Here.

10:21.830 --> 10:25.610
You can see that DPA is nothing but marks of DPA zero and DPA one.

10:25.850 --> 10:27.560
And what is max of DPA zero?

10:28.220 --> 10:29.720
Max of DPA zero is nothing.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.570
But yeah, I'm just replacing it here.

10:32.900 --> 10:37.460
The maximum DPA zero is nothing with this value, which is the p i plus one.

10:39.070 --> 10:41.030
API +18.

10:41.030 --> 10:42.920
And what is the max of Diprivan?

10:43.730 --> 10:48.350
It is nothing but this second value that we saw made, which is Ippy.

10:49.240 --> 10:49.810
I bless.

10:50.900 --> 10:55.880
You know, and of course we always have num site if I'm selecting the current.

10:58.220 --> 10:58.670
House.

10:58.670 --> 11:01.880
If I am robbing the current house, I will always have no guns.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.140
I don't know how to do this number.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.920
So I replaced these equations.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.380
I just forgot to add num num someone over there.

11:09.620 --> 11:13.680
And it will be able to place numbers, I think.

11:13.940 --> 11:19.040
But this is another working dynamic programming violation and now it is a day solution.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.920
That means the states are not good states.

11:22.460 --> 11:26.780
They did this only one state and that state where it varies over the index.

11:27.110 --> 11:28.370
This is deep what it is.

11:28.850 --> 11:33.710
If the debate is represents, tell me whatever is the best answer.

11:33.710 --> 11:34.160
If I.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.020
Robert or if I don't Robert.

11:36.230 --> 11:38.390
Just considering what the.

11:39.870 --> 11:40.590
Possibilities.

11:41.430 --> 11:43.620
So if I'm not rubbing the current on.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.550
So tell me, what's the.

11:44.910 --> 11:45.230
Yeah.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.160
So now we can, you know, derive this relation.

11:47.430 --> 11:48.630
If I'm not robbing it.

11:49.050 --> 11:52.290
If I'm not robbing the current house, tell me what's the best on certified.

11:52.290 --> 11:52.620
Rob.

11:52.980 --> 11:57.930
Rob the next episode, if I don't rob the next house, which is development one, and if I'm robbing

11:57.930 --> 12:02.170
the current house, which is taking them away, I would simply say that I'm robbing to get a dose.

12:02.190 --> 12:07.980
Now tell me, what's the best answer if I rob the next door, next house, or if I don't rob the next

12:07.980 --> 12:14.550
door next host hey so whatever is the maximum of to I'll just included in the debate so.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.340
I hope it was not very confusing.

12:18.340 --> 12:26.170
I just wanted you all to understand that any lake, not any and not every thumb to the deep relations

12:26.170 --> 12:28.510
can be derived into a one day deep relations.

12:28.750 --> 12:31.120
And you can optimize a little bit space there.

12:31.750 --> 12:38.080
And by just, you know, by just doing some replacements that we used to do in mathematics, like by

12:38.080 --> 12:41.650
using one or replacing one by two and all those things.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.260
I'm not calling this.

12:44.260 --> 12:45.610
I want you all to call it.

12:46.060 --> 12:50.260
You can call it only it's very easy to score it and memorize it.

12:50.570 --> 12:56.560
You you can use the tabular approach, I don't think it's not even two lines worth of solution in this

12:56.920 --> 12:57.100
way.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.290
These are the two recursive relations.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.760
You can use any one of them.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.320
You can use this one.

13:02.320 --> 13:05.200
Also, if you're interested in this, you can use this also.

13:06.340 --> 13:06.650
Okay.

13:07.590 --> 13:09.270
So you see in the next part, everyone.
