Hello everyone.

1
00:01.350 --> 00:06.420
So some of you might have faced this error in Mac OS or every time you update the xcode.

2
00:07.170 --> 00:11.440
What happens is that Mac OS uses Clang as its compiler.

3
00:11.490 --> 00:18.750
But generally we have a GNU C++ CPB compiler, which already has this bits/stdc++.h file

4
00:18.750 --> 00:21.030
inside the directory.

5
00:21.510 --> 00:23.160
But Clang does not have it right.

6
00:23.310 --> 00:26.310
So that's why we face this issue, which is widgets, which it 

7
00:26.310 --> 00:30.870
Says that one error generated and that this file is not found?

8
00:31.140 --> 00:34.440
Which file? bits/stdc++.h file, right

9
00:34.680 --> 00:35.880
So how did I fix it?

10
00:35.890 --> 00:36.870
Let me show that to you.

11
00:38.100 --> 00:45.480
Well, firstly on the terminal I ran the code GCC version, I got the link for a link for it.

12
00:45.530 --> 00:48.450
That where is the actually where it is actually stored?

13
00:48.930 --> 00:51.060
I copied the path.

14
00:51.090 --> 00:52.080
Let's copy the path.

15
00:53.710 --> 00:55.710
cool, let's copy it till C++.

16
00:55.750 --> 00:56.350
No problem.

17
00:57.040 --> 00:59.620
And then what we'll do is we'll just open finder.

18
01:01.130 --> 01:01.460
Okay.

19
01:01.730 --> 01:02.630
Let's open finder.

20
01:03.710 --> 01:03.920
Right.

21
01:04.310 --> 01:05.090
This is finder.

22
01:05.090 --> 01:06.860
And what we'll do is.

23
01:07.930 --> 01:08.650
Just go.

24
01:09.950 --> 01:10.700
To some.

25
01:11.750 --> 01:12.590
We'll go to a folder

26
01:12.590 --> 01:13.670
Just paste this link.

27
01:13.790 --> 01:14.210
Okay.

28
01:14.330 --> 01:18.950
And now here we are in the directory where it is using the C++ compilation.

29
01:19.250 --> 01:21.440
Where are the actual files of it located?

30
01:22.190 --> 01:23.980
We'll go in V1 part.

31
01:23.990 --> 01:29.560
And now here you can see that we have all types of stdio.h, stdint.h, string

32
01:29.670 --> 01:29.810
.h, right

33
01:30.470 --> 01:34.800
We can use them individually, but what we have to do is we have to combine all of them at once

34
01:35.090 --> 01:35.570
for that.

35
01:35.570 --> 01:42.620
How we'll do is will simply create a new folder here which is in let me write the password.

36
01:43.790 --> 01:46.550
So this folder let's call it bits eight

37
01:46.610 --> 01:47.720
So let's open this folder.

38
01:48.200 --> 01:53.950
cool, so before this, let's move back, copy some another file .h file and let's paste it

39
01:54.350 --> 01:57.200
let's rename this file to stdc++

40
01:57.200 --> 01:57.620
.h

41
01:57.650 --> 02:02.420
Now what we want to do is I want this file to have all the headers what string has.

42
02:02.870 --> 02:06.710
This is what string.h has right, so much inside it.

43
02:07.650 --> 02:07.950
Right.

44
02:08.830 --> 02:10.780
Of course, you can stand it if you want to.

45
02:11.970 --> 02:13.800
Then let's move on to.

46
02:14.160 --> 02:17.910
So I got this link on StackOverflow someone's.

47
02:19.100 --> 02:19.830
Repository.

48
02:20.600 --> 02:27.470
And here he has just copied all the header files for C and all the header files for C++.

49
02:27.560 --> 02:27.750
Right?

50
02:27.800 --> 02:29.870
So let's copy the header file for C++.

51
02:31.550 --> 02:31.820
Cool.

52
02:37.960 --> 02:39.320
So I've copied this.

53
02:39.340 --> 02:45.100
Now, what we need to do is we just have to paste all the header files inside the new file that we have made.

54
02:45.130 --> 02:46.210
stdC++

55
02:46.360 --> 02:46.810
.h file.

56
02:47.320 --> 02:48.430
Let's copy this.

57
02:48.430 --> 02:49.900
Save it, close it.

58
02:50.530 --> 02:56.620
And so here you can see inside the V1  we have bits/stdC++.h

59
02:56.860 --> 02:57.760
Now let's build this.

60
02:59.950 --> 03:00.240
Cool.

61
03:00.280 --> 03:03.640
So now the build is working completely fine.

62
03:04.440 --> 03:04.700
Right

63
03:05.770 --> 03:05.930
cool.

64
03:06.130 --> 03:07.570
So now this works.

65
03:07.580 --> 03:08.620
Now you can easily submit it 

66
03:08.650 --> 03:10.840
You don't have to come and do it again and again.

67
03:11.680 --> 03:12.730
So thank you, everyone.

68
03:12.950 --> 03:13.720
Send you in the next part!
