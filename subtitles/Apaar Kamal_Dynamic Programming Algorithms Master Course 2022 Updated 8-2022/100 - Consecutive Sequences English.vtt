00:00.880 --> 00:07.330
Blue ruin a second problem regarding dining, reprogramming and allergies kind of approach it.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.470
So it's called conjugative.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.020
Subsequent is enough problems.

00:11.070 --> 00:13.070
Don't worry, it's not F for everyone.

00:13.070 --> 00:14.390
It's for the treatment.

00:14.510 --> 00:20.720
It's not that hard, but I'll use it as I always use this problem as an education to.

00:21.770 --> 00:28.910
So you I give an integer of landing very simple and you have to choose some subsequent of this area

00:29.180 --> 00:31.370
of maximum length elegance.

00:31.700 --> 00:37.370
So sorry it's at least right now is longest subsequent state of maximum land.

00:37.370 --> 00:41.540
So there the subsequent forms are increasing sequence of consecutive number.

00:43.140 --> 00:47.310
It basically it forms an increasing sequence of consecutive integers.

00:47.610 --> 00:52.740
Basically it is analogous, but at least with consecutive integers they basically turn out to be one

00:52.740 --> 00:54.150
three, five, seven, nine.

00:54.150 --> 00:59.580
It should be one, two, three, four, five, six, eight, nine or 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.460
They should be increasing and they should be counted.

01:02.580 --> 01:04.950
Consecutive, as the name suggests.

01:06.510 --> 01:15.240
In other words, the regrets sequence should be equal to XD for some for a length of date, for some

01:15.240 --> 01:16.470
value eggs and key.

01:17.380 --> 01:22.520
Subsequent of an error can be obtained by reading some possibly zero element from the.

01:23.170 --> 01:27.970
You can erase any element not necessarily going to successively.

01:28.940 --> 01:29.180
Well.

01:29.750 --> 01:36.710
So this is just a definition of a subsequent that we have all we already know they have the power and

01:37.040 --> 01:39.500
subsequent is and one is an empty subsequent.

01:40.370 --> 01:40.550
It.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.830
MARTIN But this problem is very easy.

01:44.830 --> 01:51.370
If you pause the video and try your cell phones, it will be very easy for you to understand and solve

01:51.370 --> 01:55.000
this because now we know how to formulate deep trade.

01:55.970 --> 02:00.550
You know, what's the best ending for any element could.

02:01.370 --> 02:08.000
You know, let's see the input and let's see when example output the first ingredients in and the second

02:08.000 --> 02:10.480
line contains sildenafil per night.

02:10.520 --> 02:11.480
So this is important.

02:11.510 --> 02:16.880
The numbers are huge and on the first line print key, the maximum length of the subsequent for any

02:17.840 --> 02:21.320
for the given area that forms an increasing sequence of consecutive indeed.

02:22.670 --> 02:29.240
On the signal entering the sequence of indices to do the indices of any maximum let let's see this example

02:29.240 --> 02:31.660
in this he says okay.

02:33.360 --> 02:33.590
Yeah.

02:33.990 --> 02:38.730
In this season's it is food that means two, three, five and six by two, three, five, six by not

02:38.760 --> 02:39.900
two, three, four, five, six.

02:40.080 --> 02:40.830
Because these are in.

02:41.820 --> 02:47.730
So on the second in exam three on third index, I have four on fifth index I have five.

02:47.730 --> 02:48.900
And on sixth index I have six.

02:48.900 --> 02:52.260
So it is three, four, five, six.

02:52.980 --> 02:53.280
Right.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.670
Basically, I'm just printing the indices of those elements.

02:56.790 --> 03:00.540
Oh, I just I hope the problem is very clear.

03:00.540 --> 03:04.530
Its consecutive subsequent consecutive longest reading subsequent.

03:05.450 --> 03:07.610
Well, let's see how to.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.810
Approach this and some of you already know, right?

03:11.890 --> 03:16.210
Some of you might it might have already clicked in your mind, like, how can I approach this problem?

03:17.440 --> 03:24.190
What I've done is I've just taken an economic area of huge land and just just for exploration purposes,

03:24.970 --> 03:29.800
instead of saying only what I used to say was instead of Yeah.

03:30.940 --> 03:33.580
Earlier today, FFA wrote FFA.

03:35.620 --> 03:38.870
I believe I means the best ending point Iot index.

03:39.530 --> 03:41.870
But instead of saying index what you will see.

03:43.010 --> 03:43.460
We will see.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.180
Best ending.

03:48.340 --> 03:48.700
Number.

03:50.960 --> 03:51.620
This isn't boring.

03:51.980 --> 03:53.750
Instead of saying you're next, I'm saying number eight.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.930
But let's move forward in the dairy industry.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.600
Let's say all of them are filled with zeros.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.000
The best earnings for all of them are zeros.

04:02.870 --> 04:03.920
Let me quickly fill it.

04:06.310 --> 04:07.870
And I'm starting this way.

04:07.900 --> 04:08.920
Now, what happens is let's.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.500
At three eight towards the.

04:13.190 --> 04:14.420
Maximum land sequence.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.730
But this tree can have it can only one.

04:17.660 --> 04:22.790
Now for this second tree, guys, this tell me was the best ending for this tree.

04:23.270 --> 04:26.780
That means was the maximum length of a consecutive sequence that ends on this tree.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.040
There can't be any rate.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.080
That means the maximum earning of anyone.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.360
The greatest against ancient three is one only.

04:35.810 --> 04:38.170
Let's talk about four or four.

04:38.180 --> 04:39.470
I can see the dome.

04:40.130 --> 04:42.020
What is the best ending that this tree has?

04:42.620 --> 04:43.220
It is one.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.730
Why don't I use this tree and make a new western ending with four?

04:47.950 --> 04:53.200
That's the whole that's the whole problem because for three, we saw that the best training this two

04:53.200 --> 04:53.920
has to provide.

04:54.790 --> 04:55.300
Is zero.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.110
So the Treasury has violet in its answer.

04:59.110 --> 05:01.960
Because it cannot be abandoned after two right now.

05:02.290 --> 05:06.040
But here we can see that Ford has the best zero rating number.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.640
It can take these three because they are consecutive eight.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.840
Ford can come up to three.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.910
No matter wherever the three was in the area.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.830
But here in this area.

05:15.850 --> 05:16.690
It's together, right?

05:16.930 --> 05:18.200
So these are not the indices.

05:18.220 --> 05:19.030
Just remember this.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.620
These are the numbers.

05:21.730 --> 05:25.030
So for food, what I have is I can have the best ending to be.

05:27.020 --> 05:29.990
Because I'm using threes by standing +18.

05:30.320 --> 05:34.010
Similarly, for seven where I live or seven, the best ending of six is zero.

05:34.190 --> 05:35.270
Plus one will give me.

05:37.930 --> 05:42.460
Eight or five the best ending of what is to go.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.740
Similarly, the best ending of five should be three.

05:45.520 --> 05:46.200
You can see it eight.

05:46.240 --> 05:47.860
How is this three coming?

05:47.980 --> 05:53.030
Because it's coming from four and which is coming from the pool of six.

05:53.050 --> 05:54.010
The best ending is.

05:55.770 --> 06:02.880
But because whatever the value of six is, whatever the value of five is, plus one will be the value

06:02.880 --> 06:03.320
of six.

06:03.330 --> 06:08.370
And similarly for eight, the best training will be loop because it can be appended up to seven.

06:09.640 --> 06:16.500
What I have is the reconciliation that I can see here is that ffi is equals to f of a minus one plus

06:16.500 --> 06:17.750
one imply.

06:18.850 --> 06:20.470
It can't be anything simple than that.

06:20.500 --> 06:25.020
But here the twist is that I is not the index Iot numbers.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.910
And we know that the numbers are going to turn to the power.

06:30.910 --> 06:33.890
Nine means they are huge.

06:33.910 --> 06:37.260
That means I cannot take in any of this big land.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.400
Eight of ten to the Boer.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.370
Nine because it will give me a memory limit.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.780
What I can do is I can use a map.

06:44.320 --> 06:44.860
Very simple.

06:45.010 --> 06:49.390
Just use a map and we can make the dip in that map itself.

06:49.480 --> 06:53.860
Or the second we just compress these numbers because in the end.

06:54.220 --> 06:56.320
Okay, let me let me just give you a quick example.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.140
If you do understand this compression.

06:58.690 --> 07:02.020
So let's have this activities three over.

07:03.270 --> 07:04.050
Seven, five, six.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.090
So we can see that it's sorted out now.

07:11.770 --> 07:12.070
Okay.

07:12.070 --> 07:12.880
So it's not ordinary.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.410
Not what I can do is I can sort this out.

07:15.550 --> 07:18.610
I'm just doing this for compression purposes.

07:19.480 --> 07:19.840
Don't.

07:20.110 --> 07:22.840
It's not very much related to the solution.

07:23.740 --> 07:26.020
What I do is if I just give them numbers.

07:27.420 --> 07:33.210
So what I can say is I can give 3 to 0 number four to be the number five three.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.550
These are the respective numbers that I can give.

07:35.700 --> 07:41.040
So even if the number is standard above nine, it will have some particular value, which is less than

07:41.670 --> 07:44.820
10 to 280 power, which is the length of their.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.070
Okay.

07:46.310 --> 07:46.970
Forget this.

07:47.030 --> 07:49.010
Let's not go into competition right now.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.100
Because we can easily solve this using a map.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.930
Let's try and go to this case in the next part.

07:56.970 --> 08:03.690
And in the meanwhile, what you can do is you can try and see the how of what what will be the values

08:03.690 --> 08:06.570
for this area, this area, and how those values will be changing.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.150
But yeah, thank you.
