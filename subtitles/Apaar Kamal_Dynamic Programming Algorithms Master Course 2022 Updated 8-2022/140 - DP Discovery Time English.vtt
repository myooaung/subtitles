WEBVTT

00:00.770 --> 00:01.000
Yeah.

00:01.100 --> 00:06.050
So in the previous video we understood the literal meaning of articulation points and bridges, and

00:06.050 --> 00:07.970
we saw some various examples.

00:08.870 --> 00:15.920
Now in this tutorial, what will be will be understanding how to actually find articulation points in

00:15.920 --> 00:18.650
bridges via algorithms.

00:18.980 --> 00:24.650
I will be using some very good algorithms that have already been discussed the history and back edges

00:24.650 --> 00:27.530
and a very little help of the enemy programming.

00:27.860 --> 00:29.420
If you even do not any programming.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.020
It's all right.

00:30.020 --> 00:32.830
I'll explain everything in this video, I.

00:34.120 --> 00:38.560
So now, guys, this part has been discussed.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.400
Now we're moving on to some new terms.

00:41.660 --> 00:48.880
So we only have two terms in a hole of the concept articulation points and bridges is about this particular

00:49.750 --> 00:53.200
about these two terms and discover time and Lewis time a.

00:54.690 --> 00:57.180
We see that we have a discovered time.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.490
Of a particular note, right?

00:59.490 --> 01:05.160
So every node in the graph will contains one or will contain a discovery reading between.

01:06.280 --> 01:06.630
Sorry.

01:07.330 --> 01:07.600
Yeah.

01:08.050 --> 01:09.250
It will be a discovery.

01:09.590 --> 01:13.960
I discovered that in whatever, every node will contain this way to each and every other.

01:13.960 --> 01:14.770
Discover time.

01:15.070 --> 01:17.800
Now what we have is the lowest time.

01:17.800 --> 01:22.860
So again, every node will also have another time called a lowest time.

01:22.870 --> 01:23.950
What is the lowest time?

01:23.950 --> 01:24.940
What is the discovered time?

01:25.180 --> 01:28.510
Discuss it in detail and we'll make some examples.

01:28.990 --> 01:30.220
Then we will understand that.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.760
Why are we actually finding these times?

01:33.020 --> 01:35.950
Why do we need these times and discover time in listing?

01:36.700 --> 01:38.380
So let's move on by one case.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.470
Let's talk about Discover.

01:41.460 --> 01:45.870
But we all know when we perform the history of any graph.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.460
So we are like continuously finding and finding some nodes.

01:50.460 --> 01:52.170
We are continuously moving onto some nodes.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.970
We are discovering new ones in the DFS.

01:54.660 --> 01:54.890
Okay.

01:55.110 --> 01:59.220
So if a node is not visited, what we do is we just go and we perform DFS.

01:59.220 --> 02:04.670
We visited basically rate for the time at which a note is discovered.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.420
It's called it's discovery time.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.050
So for an example, let me give you a very, very simple example.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.120
It's not a big deal.

02:11.130 --> 02:13.770
Discovery time, lowest time can be a big day, right?

02:13.910 --> 02:15.270
They will understand it, of course.

02:15.270 --> 02:16.920
But going to stand Louis time.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.050
We need to foster understand the discovered thing.

02:19.650 --> 02:21.990
Let's make some normal graph.

02:24.820 --> 02:26.740
And then we will perform of history on this.

02:33.270 --> 02:33.430
Well.

02:33.630 --> 02:36.910
So it's a very simple example, the example I usually take.

02:36.930 --> 02:39.810
So let me like have more of the notes here.

02:44.570 --> 02:46.100
So well.

02:46.670 --> 02:49.630
Now let's mock their Discover template.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.790
So for now, I'm taking a route to be one.

02:52.790 --> 02:56.630
But as I already told you, we can take any node as the root node.

02:56.870 --> 03:04.370
Then whenever we're talking about budget packages, it's discovered time Lewis Time DFC articulation

03:04.370 --> 03:12.770
Boynton Bridges means these are independent of the node 88 feet so mean four days that if.

03:14.630 --> 03:17.570
If you have a particular note to be in articulation point.

03:17.570 --> 03:21.620
If a vertex is an articulation point, then it will be an articulation point.

03:21.620 --> 03:28.820
No matter what road you take, no matter what is the oh, no matter what angle you twist the graph,

03:29.870 --> 03:31.370
it will be an articulation point.

03:32.150 --> 03:35.600
Okay, so we don't have to worry about the root note for now.

03:36.260 --> 03:38.900
Oh, let's mark their discover time.

03:38.900 --> 03:42.410
So I will be writing discover them on the left with whatever you know.

03:42.440 --> 03:46.730
So if I start from one, that means I'm going to be on time equals 218.

03:46.730 --> 03:53.630
So initially time is equal to one eight, but when start from one, let's see the discover time of one

03:53.630 --> 03:56.390
is one one oxygen.

03:56.390 --> 03:57.230
I discovered one.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.110
Now instead of going to do, let's move on to three.

04:00.110 --> 04:04.460
So we we all know that just in DFC we can go in any direction.

04:05.390 --> 04:10.400
It completely depends on the input we have taken right in the code.

04:10.780 --> 04:11.660
It doesn't matter, right?

04:11.660 --> 04:13.200
Wherever we go look.

04:13.300 --> 04:16.310
So let's from volatility, we are going to train the DFS.

04:16.580 --> 04:18.110
Now the DFS moves on to three.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.970
So what is the Discover time of three?

04:20.720 --> 04:25.040
It's two because now these the second note to be discovered.

04:25.870 --> 04:26.190
They?

04:27.140 --> 04:28.750
In the Davis run three.

04:28.760 --> 04:29.630
Let's move to it.

04:29.810 --> 04:32.840
So let's say discovery time of your history.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.120
You guys, that turned out to be discovered, right?

04:35.120 --> 04:40.700
So whenever we are discovering a node, we are marking its timestamp and we are incrementing the time

04:40.700 --> 04:46.440
by one normal name whenever we are going to a new node marking the time and incrementing the time,

04:46.440 --> 04:48.950
removing when we go to the next node will simply.

04:50.240 --> 04:50.990
Use their time.

04:52.340 --> 04:54.630
It is one, two, three.

04:54.650 --> 04:58.880
Now from eight, we won't be able to discover anything new from it.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.410
Will go back, will drive us back.

05:00.410 --> 05:02.780
My DFS will return, of course, to three.

05:03.170 --> 05:06.950
But I know we are on three from three we can go to two.

05:06.950 --> 05:07.300
Right.

05:07.310 --> 05:09.470
So this is the fourth not to be discovered.

05:09.890 --> 05:14.210
Now from two, I cannot go to one because it has already been visited.

05:14.210 --> 05:15.800
We are performing a day of history here.

05:16.130 --> 05:16.430
Eight.

05:19.750 --> 05:23.340
But we all know if an order is visited, we don't go to that note again because we want to.

05:23.340 --> 05:26.630
Three oh, one, two, three and now let's see.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.150
Two is the fortunate to be discovered.

05:28.450 --> 05:29.710
Now from two.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.050
The defense moves on to Fort.

05:32.230 --> 05:32.560
Right.

05:33.010 --> 05:38.180
Well let's call for the time at which we discovered is five let's say moved on the right side.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.190
So it is six here.

05:40.600 --> 05:40.990
Seven.

05:41.290 --> 05:42.660
Then it went to ten.

05:42.730 --> 05:49.540
It will then be if it will come back from 10 to 6 and then from six it will go to seven, eight.

05:49.540 --> 05:51.760
So it will get nine new eight.

05:52.180 --> 05:55.570
Now from seven, we cannot go to four because it's already registered.

05:55.570 --> 05:59.320
So what I'm saying will be done back to six and then back to five, heading back to four, return back

05:59.320 --> 06:03.160
to two and then we can go tonight and this is the 10th.

06:03.190 --> 06:04.870
Not to be too late.

06:05.140 --> 06:06.190
Let me write the notes.

06:06.190 --> 06:07.300
And they're discovery times.

06:12.890 --> 06:13.910
When was discovered.

06:13.910 --> 06:14.870
Her time goes to one.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.110
Two was discovered a time ago.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.590
Two for three were discovered.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.080
Her time was for two was discovered.

06:20.090 --> 06:21.290
A time goes to five.

06:22.100 --> 06:22.640
Six.

06:23.630 --> 06:24.230
Seven.

06:25.230 --> 06:25.860
Nine.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.260
It was discovered that time goes to three.

06:30.950 --> 06:31.880
Nine was discovered.

06:31.880 --> 06:35.100
Discovery time equals to ten and ten was discovered.

06:35.100 --> 06:35.900
The time goes to it.

06:36.820 --> 06:40.010
Right here we can see that we have some unique mappings.

06:40.070 --> 06:40.370
Right.

06:40.850 --> 06:45.320
But every note we have there discovered time spent when performing the DFS.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.480
When was it first discovered?

06:48.320 --> 06:50.450
The time it was first discovered.

06:51.080 --> 06:54.280
I hope the discovery time is very clear to you.

06:54.890 --> 06:57.710
What I do is now I'll simply try to.

06:59.080 --> 06:59.620
Change.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.670
The structure of this graph.

07:02.670 --> 07:05.910
According to the DFC, we have performed a normal thing.

07:05.910 --> 07:06.300
I do.

07:07.960 --> 07:13.050
So at time goes to when I was at one, then I went to three a time to go straight to.

07:13.420 --> 07:14.380
Then I went to two.

07:14.650 --> 07:15.700
But Damond wait.

07:16.180 --> 07:17.020
Time goes to three.

07:17.020 --> 07:21.430
So I'm basically just giving them levels according to their time rate.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.260
One, three, eight.

07:23.950 --> 07:26.530
Now what is to rate so.

07:28.950 --> 07:35.880
From Diego to and yeah, now this is the fourth not to be discovered.

07:36.300 --> 07:39.900
Then the fifth note to be discovered is for six.

07:39.900 --> 07:41.820
Not to be discovered was five.

07:44.030 --> 07:52.130
Seven naught six eight notice ten 1902 rediscovered is seven eight and it is connected from.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.300
Six eight.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.410
So let me try to do.

07:57.820 --> 08:00.090
Another number seven is the ninth notable visitor.

08:00.090 --> 08:06.000
So I hope you are able to see this that I'm actually giving them levels eight discovery according to

08:06.000 --> 08:06.870
their Discovery Times.

08:07.260 --> 08:11.310
If discovery time is when it is on the first level, second level, third level, fourth, I would ensure

08:12.090 --> 08:14.430
the ninth in order to be discovered is seven.

08:14.430 --> 08:16.770
And what is the 10th in order to discover to this nine.

08:16.950 --> 08:17.220
Eight.

08:17.220 --> 08:20.580
So I disconnected from who I went from 2 to 98.

08:20.580 --> 08:23.070
So let me go from Germany.

08:25.580 --> 08:26.010
Always.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.930
So this is a DFC basically of my above graph.

08:31.090 --> 08:31.240
Hey.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.980
So this is their day officially, according to the.

08:34.580 --> 08:35.290
It's over time.

08:35.300 --> 08:39.830
I've just given their Deb just this so that we can easily visualise it basically.

08:40.970 --> 08:43.790
Now, guys, let's make back edges in this graph.

08:44.840 --> 08:48.830
And there are a lot of things to discover, a lot of things to see in this.

08:49.250 --> 08:53.780
Let me just make some packages and I hope their discovery time by this lady.

08:53.780 --> 08:54.410
All right.

08:54.410 --> 09:00.830
So just making some packages and then in the next part will understand what is the lowest time for every

09:00.830 --> 09:01.500
node will.

09:02.830 --> 09:03.310
So.

09:03.520 --> 09:03.790
Yeah.

09:03.790 --> 09:04.630
So Beckett is.

09:06.090 --> 09:10.500
So from one island to three, I went with no baggage.

09:10.860 --> 09:14.070
I came back to three renter, two in from two.

09:14.070 --> 09:15.240
I could have gone to one.

09:15.240 --> 09:15.570
Right.

09:15.720 --> 09:16.770
So that's the baggage.

09:17.570 --> 09:18.540
The one is a big it's.

09:20.910 --> 09:22.350
Eight now.

09:23.700 --> 09:24.840
The next part is from two.

09:24.840 --> 09:31.490
I went two for one, two, five and a six 4 to 7 from six, 7 to 10 night.

09:31.830 --> 09:33.050
I came back to six.

09:33.060 --> 09:34.890
I went to seven from seven.

09:34.890 --> 09:36.030
I could have gone to Fort.

09:36.950 --> 09:37.250
Right.

09:38.740 --> 09:44.830
I, I mean that there is a back edge away from someone when I could have gone to for eight days a package.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.910
And from then I came back to six, five for two, and then I went to nine.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.230
And is it about good snow?

09:51.230 --> 09:57.920
So as we can see in this particular connected graph, if a graph is and nodes.

09:59.910 --> 10:01.500
And a graphic images.

10:03.050 --> 10:03.380
Right.

10:03.860 --> 10:09.770
So we can easily find out how many back at Desert Villa, how many if you performative history that

10:09.770 --> 10:17.060
means and minus when edges will be in mighty desert definition of rain after years and not in minus

10:17.060 --> 10:17.570
one edges.

10:17.570 --> 10:18.820
And it's connected, right?

10:19.860 --> 10:23.280
So end minus one and this will be part of my DFS stream.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.440
These will be the part of my DFS stream.

10:26.850 --> 10:32.310
But these m but to deliver damages to m minus and minus one edges.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.550
The remaining edges are basically back edges.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.000
How many edges were there in total?

10:39.180 --> 10:39.900
Let me counted.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.780
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11.

10:42.780 --> 10:50.160
There 11 edges, eight if there are 11 edges here and the total notice ten what is total edges in middle

10:50.160 --> 10:50.610
of history?

10:50.610 --> 10:53.720
They should be n minus when there is nine edges in BFG.

10:54.660 --> 10:56.010
How many packages should I have?

10:56.550 --> 10:58.160
11 minus nine.

10:58.200 --> 11:03.180
There needs to be sketches so we can see that we have only two back edges in this given graph.

11:04.490 --> 11:04.920
Please.

11:05.600 --> 11:09.350
So I hope that is covered by this very clear.

11:09.350 --> 11:14.660
And the history is also clear because it has already been explained away and.

11:15.870 --> 11:16.470
After this.

11:16.470 --> 11:20.910
In the next part, we'll be discussing about the lowest time, what is the lowest time of every note.

11:20.910 --> 11:25.890
And there's some in Bahrain finding or the lowest time is the main part after everything is done.

11:25.890 --> 11:27.200
We don't have to do anything over there.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.540
Well, so thank you, guys in the next part.
