WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:01.380
Oh yeah.

00:01.400 --> 00:07.380
So let's discuss about the if history and backwards is in the attitude graphs.

00:07.560 --> 00:07.920
Right.

00:08.370 --> 00:15.920
So the main point that we are working over in director graph that will also work in a negative light.

00:16.260 --> 00:22.350
So the thing is that the logic that will abound actually drop it all to work in a negative graph, but

00:22.650 --> 00:24.300
it is not doing vice versa, right?

00:24.780 --> 00:30.570
So for directed graph also works in a negative rate and not vice versa.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.040
It's an negative graph basically.

00:32.640 --> 00:33.030
So.

00:35.150 --> 00:41.000
Let me give you one example eight so that you can easily understand why that would work or not work.

00:41.150 --> 00:47.570
So let's say I have this one to do this and directed it, and from the director that's from 2 to 3.

00:47.570 --> 00:51.820
And then they see that directing it from 1 to 3, not they're doing two guys.

00:51.890 --> 00:53.330
Is there a cycle in this?

00:55.550 --> 00:58.310
Or instead, let's just change the numbers.

00:59.570 --> 01:01.100
Let's just change the numbers.

01:02.140 --> 01:03.630
So let's call it three.

01:03.850 --> 01:04.780
Let's call it one.

01:04.780 --> 01:05.680
Let's call it two.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.710
So is there a cycling race in this?

01:11.020 --> 01:11.500
Graph.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.290
No right in this regard.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.280
There is no second.

01:17.130 --> 01:18.780
So how am I figuring this out?

01:18.790 --> 01:20.000
Because there is no baggage.

01:20.580 --> 01:20.860
Right.

01:21.000 --> 01:30.000
But if I perform this DFC approach in this directed graph, then I will see that the algorithm that

01:30.000 --> 01:33.270
we have already coded out for undirected graphs when it is here.

01:33.420 --> 01:33.750
Right.

01:33.930 --> 01:37.170
This will give me true that yes, the cycle is there.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.010
How and why?

01:38.010 --> 01:38.490
Let's see.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.370
So this is what happens is let's start started the office from one.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.410
But from when I cannot go anywhere.

01:45.280 --> 01:45.620
Right.

01:45.820 --> 01:46.750
But then I come to.

01:46.750 --> 01:47.030
To.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.080
I started underneath this room to see.

01:50.590 --> 01:51.450
Initially, I started.

01:51.450 --> 01:52.210
If it's from one.

01:52.390 --> 01:53.920
From when I cannot go to anywhere.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.540
Then the loop will move forward.

01:55.750 --> 01:58.930
And then I'll start in their office from the right sector.

01:58.930 --> 01:59.860
Which period is zero?

02:01.060 --> 02:01.390
Right.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.270
Because it's being started from two.

02:04.570 --> 02:09.700
Now is what happens is from two it will go to one because there is this directory as from one.

02:10.270 --> 02:11.700
So in two doesn't distancing.

02:11.980 --> 02:16.510
We had one right and one was already visited.

02:19.040 --> 02:19.850
Can we see this?

02:20.690 --> 02:20.990
Yeah.

02:21.110 --> 02:21.470
See?

02:21.980 --> 02:23.300
One was already visited.

02:23.390 --> 02:25.190
That means we'll go in as if this.

02:26.370 --> 02:30.300
Rabies TB having as from 2 to 1 and when was already visited.

02:30.300 --> 02:33.570
So we won't be performing a DFS on when it's already visited.

02:33.570 --> 02:33.870
Right.

02:34.260 --> 02:39.570
Really going this as if case that it is already visited and also one is not parent of two by because

02:39.570 --> 02:41.880
parent of two was passed zero.

02:41.880 --> 02:42.240
Right.

02:42.750 --> 02:46.320
We've been enough to his boss zero and one was not equal to zero.

02:46.380 --> 02:48.570
That means we will get a cycle.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.670
But is there a cycle?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.960
You guys, let's talk about only this graph.

02:51.960 --> 02:55.110
Only this is there is no.

02:55.170 --> 02:55.510
Right.

02:55.510 --> 02:56.280
So let me like.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.590
The smallest example.

02:58.610 --> 03:02.210
This is so this is a graph of two edges.

03:02.420 --> 03:06.770
So the two nodes and one edge and the direction is this 2 to 1.

03:08.270 --> 03:08.560
Nate.

03:08.930 --> 03:09.290
So.

03:10.800 --> 03:11.010
Here.

03:11.010 --> 03:13.600
What I'm learning is the cycle is not fun, right?

03:13.620 --> 03:18.030
So let's see what what is that thing going on in there?

03:18.030 --> 03:18.360
Right.

03:18.690 --> 03:19.170
First.

03:20.070 --> 03:21.680
Okay, so here I am, made up.

03:21.690 --> 03:23.070
Back to the graph.

03:23.070 --> 03:28.170
Sorry, I have to, like, come in this thing out and then it will become a dedicated graph.

03:28.170 --> 03:32.190
So let's build it again and we can see is this has been fun, right?

03:32.880 --> 03:35.130
This is an input of directed graph from x.

03:35.130 --> 03:38.880
I am pushing back on divide there differently from x2y on the right.

03:39.120 --> 03:39.930
And what is the graph?

03:40.170 --> 03:48.540
The graph is just this one edge from 2 to 1 and it is saying that yes, the sex lesbian found it y because

03:48.880 --> 03:54.600
as were literally one is already visited and from two there is a as 211 is visited and not equal to

03:54.600 --> 03:54.960
parent.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.470
So it will say, yes, this actually has been found and it is going backwards.

03:58.710 --> 04:00.600
But that's not absolutely true.

04:00.600 --> 04:00.930
Right.

04:01.620 --> 04:02.780
Let me off.

04:03.780 --> 04:05.070
Now I see this somewhere.

04:06.300 --> 04:06.750
Mm.

04:07.260 --> 04:07.950
Just a second.

04:12.350 --> 04:12.620
Yeah.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.900
So I'd say world leaders.

04:16.290 --> 04:16.590
Cool.

04:16.620 --> 04:19.190
So this doesn't work for directed graphs.

04:19.200 --> 04:19.890
I need to work now.

04:19.900 --> 04:26.400
Let's discuss one particular approach which will work for both director as well as under glass.

04:26.880 --> 04:27.260
Right.

04:27.790 --> 04:29.940
So let's make that approach.

04:29.940 --> 04:31.600
Let's understand that approach first.

04:31.620 --> 04:31.950
Right.

04:32.190 --> 04:35.490
So what was the definition of baggage that I gave you that?

04:37.680 --> 04:45.480
So again, it's a very easy thing that Beck is an edge, which is finding from some current note, whatever

04:45.480 --> 04:48.150
the current notice to one of its ancestors.

04:48.930 --> 04:55.390
I hope you remember I said the word ancestors hate it and that I should not be able to experience rain.

04:55.890 --> 05:00.400
So I've got this node which is pointing from current to one of its ancestors.

05:00.420 --> 05:01.350
What is an ancestor?

05:01.710 --> 05:04.020
Let's talk about what is an ancestor, right?

05:04.380 --> 05:09.330
Whenever I am whenever I talk about trees, that means let's talk about this tree.

05:12.120 --> 05:12.440
Right.

05:13.080 --> 05:18.570
So guys here, if I start, if I make one as a root note and started the first search.

05:18.570 --> 05:22.350
So from when I go to I'll go to the tree, I'll go to 48.

05:22.740 --> 05:28.770
So basically three is a parent of four, two is an ancestor of four and one of those an ancestor of.

05:28.800 --> 05:29.280
All right.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.460
So what are the ancestors of a particular node?

05:32.910 --> 05:35.190
All those nodes which lie.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.660
And sisters and sisters.

05:40.610 --> 05:42.410
Nodes which lie between.

05:43.660 --> 05:45.250
I would lie on the board.

05:48.730 --> 05:49.210
From.

05:50.580 --> 05:51.060
Root.

05:52.650 --> 05:54.090
To child.

05:54.990 --> 05:55.230
Okay.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.920
So from root to tail, whichever node lies on the barred from.

06:00.250 --> 06:03.620
In order to tell their court their Thomas ancestors.

06:03.800 --> 06:04.190
Right.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.620
So him and sisters are one, two and three.

06:06.620 --> 06:08.390
And of course, he's also a parent.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.050
Eight.

06:10.200 --> 06:10.500
Good.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.150
So I hope this part is clear.

06:12.150 --> 06:13.020
What are and.

06:13.860 --> 06:14.190
Right.

06:14.580 --> 06:17.430
So, guys, let's come back to this simple graph.

06:18.090 --> 06:23.400
So here we can see that one was visiting and one was not pairing, but it was not an ancestor of two.

06:23.880 --> 06:24.250
Right.

06:24.300 --> 06:29.700
Because when I started here first from two, then two is only the road, not road.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.590
And then from two, I cannot go anywhere.

06:31.590 --> 06:31.820
Right.

06:31.830 --> 06:34.560
Because one is already visited two guys.

06:35.790 --> 06:42.820
The important time that we are having here is that Beckett will be pointing towards insistence.

06:42.840 --> 06:49.530
So here we can see coming back to the above example, that one was an ancestor of three because from

06:49.530 --> 06:50.610
one I went to two.

06:50.730 --> 06:51.810
Then I came to three.

06:52.170 --> 06:54.000
Then there's a nest pointing backwards.

06:54.510 --> 06:54.840
Right.

06:55.050 --> 06:57.630
And four was an ancestor of seven.

06:58.830 --> 07:04.440
They always are back, as will be pointing to one of its ancestors, which is behind it.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.850
What is an ancestor?

07:06.660 --> 07:10.290
Ancestor is a node which is between.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.220
Which is in the bottom drawer due to the current.

07:14.500 --> 07:14.980
Cool guys.

07:15.640 --> 07:21.550
So here, let us discuss some spatial properties of the first search engine sisters combined.

07:22.420 --> 07:28.450
This is a very unique piece that you will not see everywhere, but it will come handy a lot.

07:28.690 --> 07:28.990
Right?

07:29.020 --> 07:31.270
So let's discuss this very special property.

07:33.630 --> 07:36.570
Property of ancestors and beliefs.

07:37.340 --> 07:38.430
It's very interesting.

07:44.460 --> 07:44.720
Right.

07:45.210 --> 07:49.740
So the property is very simple that we know how does a DFS work?

07:49.740 --> 07:50.820
It works by using it.

07:50.820 --> 07:55.140
It goes on trade, it creates gold stacks in the memory.

07:55.170 --> 07:55.530
Right.

07:56.100 --> 08:03.150
So if there is a node which is an ancestor of the current node, right, then that node has to be in

08:03.150 --> 08:05.490
the call stack when it comes to the current node.

08:05.820 --> 08:06.120
Right.

08:06.270 --> 08:07.230
So ancestor.

08:09.900 --> 08:10.740
Has to be.

08:12.110 --> 08:13.280
In the golf stick.

08:17.870 --> 08:18.350
When?

08:19.570 --> 08:20.260
I reach.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.070
The child or the current or.

08:25.170 --> 08:26.680
So let me explain you this point.

08:26.680 --> 08:26.910
Right?

08:27.000 --> 08:27.830
What does this mean?

08:27.840 --> 08:29.250
What does the call stack means?

08:29.820 --> 08:31.080
I hope you know, where does it go?

08:31.110 --> 08:31.560
Stack mean?

08:31.560 --> 08:33.450
But still, let's discuss it.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.220
This is a stack, right?

08:35.670 --> 08:42.390
So whenever we are going over recursion and we call different equations.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.430
So what happened called stack builds up.

08:44.580 --> 08:44.880
Right.

08:45.210 --> 08:51.570
That means if I say if I call factorial recursion, then there will be some call seg that will be below.

08:51.570 --> 08:53.280
And then we will come back from this call.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.390
Stack eight.

08:55.490 --> 08:59.350
So here what happens is let's make a very, very simple graph.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.200
One, two.

09:01.490 --> 09:02.090
Three, four.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.660
And it's a five and it's a six.

09:06.460 --> 09:06.730
Cool.

09:06.910 --> 09:09.550
And I'm like, I'm like, no, starting DFS from one.

09:09.940 --> 09:15.010
So what happens is when I start for DFS from when the DFS stack will be built.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.320
So I'll go to one over here.

09:17.680 --> 09:22.960
The first one will come in Macau, say, great, right now I'm the first node.

09:23.440 --> 09:24.580
Then from one I'll go to.

09:26.510 --> 09:27.440
A new staggered reader.

09:27.740 --> 09:30.080
I wonder, do I am traversing to do right?

09:30.380 --> 09:37.130
What are the caustic means that this particular thing, this one hole function will be created with

09:37.160 --> 09:41.510
the terms the office of to Goma, the parent that is one eight.

09:42.170 --> 09:45.020
Now, guys, when I go to three, let's go to three.

09:47.010 --> 09:47.230
Good.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.460
Now we can notice a very special thing here.

09:50.940 --> 09:57.960
A very special trick or a thing or whatever you call it, that when I'm on tree, whatever is the topmost

09:57.960 --> 10:04.350
node in the cause stack at any point of time, whatever is the topmost note of the call stick, the

10:04.440 --> 10:08.310
below notes will always represent its ancestors.

10:08.910 --> 10:10.530
These are its and sisters.

10:13.100 --> 10:13.400
Eight.

10:15.140 --> 10:20.780
Frankly speaking, if this recursion and God sake is not clear to you, the if is not clear to you.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.690
Then do more questions.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.870
Practice more questions on the office and the government.

10:27.110 --> 10:27.340
Right.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.230
Because after this, we will only be using the questions.

10:30.650 --> 10:30.980
Eight.

10:32.620 --> 10:32.880
Well.

10:33.430 --> 10:40.360
So I hope you have understood this part that whatever is the topmost nor right verdict of what's not

10:40.360 --> 10:44.290
in the stack means that currently I'm on this note and all the other notes are the.

10:46.350 --> 10:47.940
Ancestors of the current no rate.

10:48.270 --> 10:50.230
So after today, I won't be able to go anywhere.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.020
So three will be returning back.

10:52.770 --> 10:53.970
What does return back means?

10:54.480 --> 10:55.120
When I.

10:55.140 --> 11:00.540
When I'm making a function and the function call and I return back, I go back.

11:00.540 --> 11:01.920
So if I don't write this or didn't.

11:03.230 --> 11:06.530
It is same as a running back because this function is.

11:07.590 --> 11:08.070
Ending.

11:08.070 --> 11:09.540
It has completed its work.

11:09.600 --> 11:09.990
They.

11:11.210 --> 11:14.030
So I wrote Baghdad I for 70 to.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.650
I went to I went to three.

11:16.650 --> 11:17.820
I came back to do now.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.830
Now two is on the job right now.

11:19.830 --> 11:20.970
From two, I'm going to four.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.870
So when I come to fort, as we can see again doing Varnado.

11:25.890 --> 11:27.150
Ancestors of food.

11:28.020 --> 11:28.410
Right.

11:29.920 --> 11:36.050
Now from what I'm going to five again, we can see one, two in four transistors of five.

11:36.370 --> 11:38.800
So the idea of this particular part.

11:40.310 --> 11:42.510
This whole part is in the girl's name.

11:43.430 --> 11:50.600
There are very beautiful cushions that are made from this particular topic and it's only a kick start.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.230
I saw like kick started on B and the last question.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.110
Or it is only last question of 2021.

11:58.290 --> 11:59.790
It was completely based on this.

12:00.180 --> 12:01.170
Like what?

12:01.170 --> 12:01.950
All the ancestors.

12:01.950 --> 12:02.670
We want to find the.

12:03.450 --> 12:04.090
Nothing else.

12:04.170 --> 12:04.500
Right.

12:05.190 --> 12:05.610
And.

12:06.090 --> 12:06.410
Yeah.

12:07.540 --> 12:07.930
So.

12:09.530 --> 12:10.070
Here we are.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.500
Now go.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.130
Go back from 5 to 4.

12:13.130 --> 12:14.030
Coming back to four.

12:14.030 --> 12:16.310
Coming back to two, because we don't have anywhere to go.

12:16.580 --> 12:17.600
Coming back to one.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.890
Now we have come back to one.

12:19.910 --> 12:22.370
I will go to six because six was not visited.

12:22.680 --> 12:26.980
Now, again, we can see we have this one as an ancestor of six lives.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.360
So whatever nought is on the top of the stack.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.580
All the other ancestors are in the cold state.

12:32.330 --> 12:33.880
Northern England called staying.

12:33.890 --> 12:35.500
Only the ancestors are in the coal state.

12:35.510 --> 12:36.440
Always remember that.

12:37.310 --> 12:37.610
Yeah.

12:39.170 --> 12:46.970
So now we have got this spatial property of ancestors and DFS that we can easily find out which is an

12:46.970 --> 12:48.320
ancestor of an other node.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.890
By performing a DFS load.

12:50.890 --> 12:56.680
And guys, it's a very simple thing that if I'm considering one as a route, more than two is in instead

12:56.680 --> 12:57.070
of three.

12:57.430 --> 13:04.330
But if I consider four as a route node for three, two and one nowadays we can easily see that three

13:04.330 --> 13:05.830
becomes instead of two.

13:07.010 --> 13:12.740
Eight and sisters are completely dependent on their beliefs tree the root of their delivery.

13:12.770 --> 13:14.840
Whatever the rule you are choosing, right?

13:14.930 --> 13:21.590
If you are choosing some other node as the root, then that becomes then the ancestors change and vice

13:21.590 --> 13:21.950
versa.

13:23.150 --> 13:28.550
So this is again a very simple thing to notice that water ancestors, how to find ancestors.

13:28.670 --> 13:29.660
Again, we have got this.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.440
We have community offers, whatever the nodes in the cold stack.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.450
See, we cannot xisco stick.

13:35.450 --> 13:35.740
Right.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.850
But we can have some spatial.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.880
Uh, markings.

13:40.920 --> 13:41.230
Right.

13:41.260 --> 13:41.570
We're going to.

13:41.660 --> 13:41.930
Okay.

13:41.930 --> 13:44.210
We got electricity back.

13:45.220 --> 13:45.460
Well.

13:47.380 --> 13:53.950
So we have this special markings which will help us understand ancestors that these are the ancestors

13:53.950 --> 13:55.510
of caring or good.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.160
So what are those markings?

13:57.430 --> 13:58.270
What we will do is.

13:59.290 --> 14:02.050
For every note, we will divide it into three parts.

14:02.530 --> 14:04.540
Note We will color the note, basically.

14:04.810 --> 14:09.400
So if I'm saying I have a note, then I'll say that we have three parts of this note and that it is

14:09.400 --> 14:09.940
visited.

14:11.210 --> 14:12.320
It is not visited.

14:15.560 --> 14:16.940
And the third is it is in.

14:18.050 --> 14:18.710
Biotech.

14:22.730 --> 14:24.600
But we have three things here.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.060
Right, that is honored.

14:26.420 --> 14:30.860
Let's let's it does not zero means that it is not visited.

14:30.860 --> 14:31.820
And it is also not in.

14:32.780 --> 14:34.040
It's not visited.

14:36.290 --> 14:36.710
Okay.

14:36.740 --> 14:38.690
Let me try it properly.

14:38.990 --> 14:40.700
So we have three states, right?

14:41.390 --> 14:49.040
By these states, we can easily understand that the current notice visited or it is it is visited and

14:49.130 --> 14:50.810
that means it is already visited or not.

14:51.110 --> 14:54.290
It is in the caustic or not or it is yet to be visited.

14:54.290 --> 14:54.590
Right.

14:54.890 --> 14:57.140
So zero means that it is yet to be visited.

15:00.740 --> 15:03.200
Well, now one means that.

15:05.380 --> 15:05.870
Uh.

15:06.640 --> 15:07.510
What does one means?

15:07.930 --> 15:10.090
Yeah, one means that it is visited.

15:11.270 --> 15:13.430
And in golf stick.

15:17.620 --> 15:20.200
Rape and murder still means that it is visited.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.540
So I don't visit it again.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.970
And it is not in caustic and not in.

15:27.270 --> 15:29.040
Called Steck.

15:32.080 --> 15:37.260
So what I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to give three states to all the nodes.

15:37.610 --> 15:37.900
Okay.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.920
So how to give this seriously, guys?

15:39.940 --> 15:41.470
It's very, very easy, right?

15:42.040 --> 15:44.650
Whenever I come to a node, I will it.

15:44.650 --> 15:48.770
When I say this visit, it is equal to one day.

15:48.970 --> 15:51.750
That means right now the node is now called stick.

15:52.030 --> 15:52.670
Because it is.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.520
We have come to this node and it is visited.

15:55.090 --> 15:56.050
That is a one guess.

15:56.830 --> 16:01.780
And when I leave this node here, I'll make it very easy.

16:01.780 --> 16:02.020
Right.

16:02.410 --> 16:06.040
It is anywhere linear that it is visited equals to do so.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.980
What this tool means that it is already being visited.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.640
It is visited and it is not in caused by.

16:12.640 --> 16:17.800
It does not even call say because we are leaving it to the events we are marking it visited.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.260
It goes to two so that we don't visit it again.

16:20.260 --> 16:20.560
Right.

16:21.710 --> 16:24.510
And we'll simply put it on back here later.

16:25.980 --> 16:29.040
Well, there is a very just a very small change.

16:29.220 --> 16:33.300
And this small change will help us understand a lot of things for dedicated groups.

16:33.790 --> 16:34.060
Right.

16:34.710 --> 16:38.190
So what we do over here is we perform at the office well in good.

16:39.370 --> 16:40.570
We started the office.

16:40.930 --> 16:49.360
Whenever I'm going in and whenever I'm coming to a normal market, one that means it is visited, visited

16:49.660 --> 16:50.140
and.

16:53.150 --> 16:54.050
Engel stick.

16:56.000 --> 17:03.920
And this is visited and not in golf stick because after this I'm coming back from it.

17:03.920 --> 17:04.210
Right?

17:04.220 --> 17:05.210
I'm going back from it.

17:05.870 --> 17:08.090
So guys know, what is the definition of a baggage?

17:09.520 --> 17:09.760
Okay.

17:09.970 --> 17:11.440
Let's come on to this DFS part.

17:11.440 --> 17:15.160
So we are going there does NZ list of some current node.

17:15.700 --> 17:20.830
So if the existing node is not visited, then simply performative is cool.

17:20.830 --> 17:24.220
If they're just ignored as not visited by former DFS, go to it.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.820
Or we can also write it for our understanding.

17:27.820 --> 17:30.370
Seek that visitor of X is zero.

17:31.300 --> 17:35.350
If it was not visited, go to it of under DFS perform regular things.

17:35.710 --> 17:42.550
Otherwise it was visited at the visit was visited and as I said.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.600
That package all points twin sisters and not bearings.

17:46.730 --> 17:46.880
Right.

17:46.930 --> 17:55.030
So as well we say that X should not be equal to parent and visited of x should be equal to how much?

17:55.720 --> 17:56.530
Think about it, guys.

17:56.710 --> 17:57.910
It should be called Stack.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.510
What does in go take means it is minus one.

18:02.670 --> 18:03.900
Right and visited.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.060
I should be equal to one and not to write more.

18:06.060 --> 18:07.890
Just two means that I have already left it.

18:09.540 --> 18:15.810
So this particular algorithm, this particular DFS of mocking it one, mocking it two, and checking

18:16.560 --> 18:22.200
that whether an ordinary course take or not by just checking you ever the visited of access one not

18:22.200 --> 18:26.010
not a this will help us detect sagging in directed graphs.

18:26.010 --> 18:32.400
Now this will help us understand the concept of back edges in directed end edited graphs in both the

18:32.400 --> 18:32.700
graph.

18:32.700 --> 18:33.360
This will work.

18:34.110 --> 18:38.580
If you remember in the previous lecture we were getting a back is from.

18:40.170 --> 18:43.170
We are getting a package from 4 to 7 dogs and 7 to 4 also.

18:43.170 --> 18:43.400
Right.

18:43.410 --> 18:44.970
But that's not possible, right?

18:44.970 --> 18:46.320
We cannot have two back engines.

18:47.130 --> 18:51.360
If I fix the route, then we can only have one package that is from 7 to 4.

18:51.690 --> 18:55.440
This will also solve my problem of the packages.

18:56.010 --> 18:56.250
Will.

18:57.330 --> 18:58.890
In undated graphs.

18:59.490 --> 19:01.970
So, guys, this was about addicted enough.

19:01.980 --> 19:04.250
And let me run over this case.

19:04.260 --> 19:06.630
Let's run this current algorithm over this case.

19:06.660 --> 19:06.960
Right.

19:08.310 --> 19:14.580
So what happens is firstly I go to one, I market one, I cannot go to any of their descent, then I

19:14.580 --> 19:15.990
market to win, live it.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.490
So it's visited has been marked to two ways.

19:20.010 --> 19:25.260
Well, then I go to to a market one and then there's this edge which is pointing to one.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.770
So goes once visited is equal to two.

19:29.340 --> 19:29.600
Right.

19:29.670 --> 19:30.570
So let's come back here.

19:30.990 --> 19:32.580
So is it visited equal to zero?

19:34.020 --> 19:34.440
Sorry.

19:34.620 --> 19:34.980
No.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.240
It is not equal to zero.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.440
Then we will win this elseif.

19:37.950 --> 19:39.180
It is not equal to parent.

19:39.660 --> 19:40.010
Right.

19:40.020 --> 19:41.880
Of course one is not equal to parent of two.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.170
Because parent of two is zero.

19:43.170 --> 19:43.340
Right?

19:43.350 --> 19:45.600
For now, because they pass zero on the new device.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.410
And it's visited of one equal to one.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.550
No, that means one is not in the coal state.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.840
That means one is not then sister of two.

19:55.710 --> 19:56.960
So this is not a package.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.280
So we won't go inside this elusive.

20:01.060 --> 20:02.230
I hope you are getting the point.

20:02.300 --> 20:02.730
All right.

20:02.750 --> 20:06.610
So let's again, let's run on this algorithm.

20:06.820 --> 20:09.310
Listen, this algorithm on this particular example.

20:10.060 --> 20:15.270
So in Italy, we go to one, we market one, then we leave it because we're not able to go in.

20:15.430 --> 20:17.920
We market two, then we go to two.

20:19.490 --> 20:21.470
And from do I cannot go to anywhere.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.250
So we market.

20:22.250 --> 20:23.720
One cannot go anywhere.

20:23.720 --> 20:24.640
Market to limit.

20:25.430 --> 20:26.360
Then we go to three.

20:26.870 --> 20:28.100
From three, I come here.

20:29.150 --> 20:30.590
Ticky, I can go to two or not.

20:30.590 --> 20:31.490
I cannot go to two.

20:31.490 --> 20:37.160
And also it's not a package because it is not in the call stick and simply I'll come back from the DFS

20:37.430 --> 20:37.880
from three.

20:37.880 --> 20:38.950
So there's no cycle here.

20:39.310 --> 20:39.570
Right.

20:39.590 --> 20:42.050
And now let's talk about a psychic is in addicted girl.

20:43.070 --> 20:45.460
How to detect the segregation addicted black rate.

20:45.980 --> 20:47.570
So I went to one market.

20:47.570 --> 20:51.110
When I went to Madrid one, I went to three magnet one.

20:51.560 --> 20:55.550
Now from three I can see that I can go to one and one was marked one.

20:55.550 --> 20:56.540
That means it is in.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.270
Full stack.

20:58.270 --> 21:00.220
That means it is an ancestor of tree.

21:00.640 --> 21:03.640
So this adds from 3 to 1 is a backwards.

21:07.420 --> 21:12.730
Always because one is in the coastguard, as we mark one, we have not left one.

21:13.090 --> 21:16.150
Now, after this, we have got a package and I will return back.

21:16.150 --> 21:16.910
So will Mark three.

21:16.910 --> 21:17.410
Yes, two.

21:17.470 --> 21:19.870
Will Mark the West Wing in one is to return back.

21:21.640 --> 21:22.990
I hope you are understanding this.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.430
These are the basics of religion.

21:24.430 --> 21:29.500
India is mocking, mocking them, understanding whether they are in the God's take or not.

21:30.790 --> 21:39.220
Well, guys, so let's run this algorithm on this graph that we have media and let's say this is our

21:39.910 --> 21:40.540
negative group.

21:40.540 --> 21:44.850
So as I told you, this algorithm will work on addicted and addicted both graphs.

21:46.110 --> 21:46.660
So let's.

21:47.990 --> 21:50.960
See out whatever the package is we are getting.

21:53.740 --> 21:59.120
I remember we used to go get we used to get for my kids is right there it is to do one and then 1 to

21:59.120 --> 22:02.650
2 and then 4 to 7, two, four and 4 to 7, eight.

22:02.650 --> 22:03.520
But that's not true.

22:03.940 --> 22:06.580
We will have only packages which have burned out.

22:07.180 --> 22:08.500
Then they are pointing backwards.

22:09.100 --> 22:09.340
Okay.

22:10.210 --> 22:12.850
So we only have two packages now.

22:12.850 --> 22:16.450
There is from 2 to 1 and 7 to 4 in the original graph.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.140
Yeah, I guess so.

22:19.140 --> 22:22.520
Forget about the last algorithm that we discussed about finding packages.

22:23.370 --> 22:25.020
Keep this algorithm in mind.

22:25.020 --> 22:30.960
There's only one thing that I did that was I might visited to be able to do here, which tells us that

22:30.960 --> 22:31.830
it has been visited.

22:31.830 --> 22:32.760
Don't visit it again.

22:33.270 --> 22:37.160
Eight Because here I'll write if visited I was from zero eight.

22:37.860 --> 22:45.090
So this tells me this the complexity of the code remains often only because I'm marking it to I'm not

22:45.090 --> 22:45.940
visiting it again.

22:45.960 --> 22:46.330
Right.

22:46.470 --> 22:49.910
And secondly, we check whether or not is in equal state or not.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.480
If it is in a classic, I gotta.

22:52.540 --> 22:53.040
Package.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.080
This is the final record of finding packages.

22:57.180 --> 22:57.730
Clear, guys.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.620
So this can be used in both vector and grass.

23:02.010 --> 23:03.930
It will work in both the grass and.

23:05.650 --> 23:11.170
A very simple algorithm will and grace, and soon the next part.
