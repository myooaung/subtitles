00:00.700 --> 00:01.450
Hello, everyone.

00:01.910 --> 00:06.430
Let's call a very beautiful problem from we will kick start.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.640
And this was passed in 2000 and down day.

00:10.210 --> 00:12.250
It started 2020 and.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.470
Let's see the provenance gold plate.

00:15.850 --> 00:21.460
And these points are actually for the first problem, and this is for the second constraint.

00:21.910 --> 00:22.060
Eight.

00:22.210 --> 00:27.130
So we will see that we have two different problems with two different tests.

00:28.270 --> 00:29.500
So let's see the problem.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.440
It's a very, very nice, beautiful, deep problem.

00:33.140 --> 00:35.440
So Dr. Patel has end state plates.

00:35.890 --> 00:37.240
Each step contains.

00:37.390 --> 00:38.810
Keep it right.

00:38.830 --> 00:42.280
So we have laminated like this.

00:42.760 --> 00:43.480
Basically we have.

00:43.480 --> 00:43.930
Let's see.

00:44.960 --> 00:51.500
And actually it and there are there are some plates which are let's represent plates by this.

00:52.580 --> 00:55.370
And this is of killing eight.

00:55.370 --> 00:55.670
So.

00:56.510 --> 01:00.110
And stack plates and all those plates are kept on each other.

01:00.380 --> 01:01.160
And those are.

01:02.610 --> 01:03.170
Giblet.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.830
So we can also show them this way that plates are stacked on each other.

01:07.830 --> 01:13.920
But I prefer this because you'll see though, the plate.

01:14.960 --> 01:15.260
Yeah.

01:15.680 --> 01:20.960
So each plate has a positive beauty value and describing how beautiful it looks.

01:21.230 --> 01:23.540
So there's a value associated with the edge of the plate.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.310
Dr. Patel would like to take exactly plates.

01:27.560 --> 01:28.330
This is important.

01:28.340 --> 01:29.030
Exactly.

01:29.360 --> 01:29.930
We plates.

01:29.930 --> 01:32.030
So we have to take exactly plates.

01:33.930 --> 01:35.100
Who use for dinner tonight.

01:35.160 --> 01:41.520
If he would like to take a blade in the stack, he must also take all the plates above it in the stack

01:41.520 --> 01:41.820
as well.

01:41.880 --> 01:43.590
So this is the main condition of the problem.

01:44.130 --> 01:46.860
For example, let's talk about this stack.

01:46.860 --> 01:48.860
So stack is this way back.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.110
This is one stack.

01:52.650 --> 01:55.800
This is and this deck is another stack in the center stack.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.550
All these plates have some beauty value associated with them.

01:58.560 --> 02:05.730
So let's see if Dr. Patel takes two plates from the first deck so he can not just pick the second plate

02:06.210 --> 02:07.950
and find the maximum value.

02:08.100 --> 02:13.140
But he has to take two plates from it if he has if he wants to take the second place plate.

02:13.140 --> 02:18.930
Also, if he wants to take three plates from this deck, then he has to pick up top three plates.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.280
Only if he.

02:21.370 --> 02:23.550
Except for plates on the first leg.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.260
Then basically I have your industry date.

02:26.530 --> 02:31.420
If you want some number of plates, he'll just pick up those number of plates from the top of this state

02:31.870 --> 02:32.140
plate.

02:33.240 --> 02:39.300
So help Dr. Patel big p plates that would maximise the total time of the year devalues.

02:40.380 --> 02:43.320
So a very beautiful problem with some beauty values in it.

02:43.320 --> 02:49.500
And there are other things which are energy in the low end and can be as and in case nothing.

02:49.500 --> 02:54.810
But it's just we have been given a grid and that as some value this year did with it.

02:55.380 --> 03:02.550
So let's let's move on to the desk visit if we can see that these hundred fine is 30 and we will be

03:02.550 --> 03:04.000
less than and integrate.

03:04.230 --> 03:10.170
What is the meaning of this that we will be less than and in look this only means one thing that.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.590
The beauty value will exist, right?

03:15.630 --> 03:19.740
Because we can always select and into tablets for you.

03:19.980 --> 03:23.820
What if P is greater than an indicator and indicates the number of total plates?

03:24.150 --> 03:28.410
If P is greater than that, it will be minus one, but we can easily see that we use less than equal

03:28.410 --> 03:31.140
when in the case of the foot, doing so will always exist.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.380
Okay, so this is the sample input.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.250
Let's see the input.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.210
So we have to.

03:37.490 --> 03:38.990
Then we have two, four, five.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.850
Two for five.

03:41.850 --> 03:46.710
And then we have these plates which are then 1030.

03:46.770 --> 03:47.550
These are the values.

03:47.550 --> 03:54.600
So basically we have two sticks with sticks and this is key, which is the number of plates in one stick

03:54.870 --> 03:55.200
eight.

03:55.590 --> 03:58.770
And the next steak is 80, 50, then 50.

04:01.870 --> 04:02.100
Well.

04:02.650 --> 04:05.830
So we have these statistics and what we want to find out.

04:05.830 --> 04:09.240
We want to find out what is the best cost of picking five bleeds.

04:10.420 --> 04:13.960
So how can we apply, like, just, you know, try something in this?

04:13.990 --> 04:15.610
How can we pick up five bullets?

04:16.180 --> 04:21.370
The first option is to pick up zero plate from the first one and pick up.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.050
I played some the second one.

04:23.570 --> 04:27.550
As we can see, it's not possible because the second does not have by plate.

04:27.580 --> 04:33.060
The second option is pick up one plate from the first and all plate from the second aid.

04:33.280 --> 04:37.060
So in this case, what would be the value if I pick one from the first and fourth?

04:37.060 --> 04:44.740
From the second, I can easily see it will be ten plus what is there, but some 80 plus hundred plus

04:44.740 --> 04:45.550
ten is.

04:46.510 --> 04:50.860
198 and the ten in the first one will be.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.380
So it will be ten plus 198 200.

04:55.220 --> 04:57.710
The second can be picked due from the first row.

04:58.280 --> 05:03.710
From the second row three from the first row, two from the second row or from the first row and one

05:03.710 --> 05:08.660
from the fifth through or five from the first row and zero from the second row.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.390
So basically this was not possible because we don't have five.

05:12.050 --> 05:17.810
And all out of all these, for the best answer, that will get us to 58.

05:18.710 --> 05:19.490
I'll get to 50.

05:19.490 --> 05:22.940
I think we'll get it by this day from the first and two.

05:22.940 --> 05:23.600
From the second.

05:23.600 --> 05:23.930
Right.

05:24.350 --> 05:29.340
So here we can see it is 120 and this is 138.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.570
So we are getting to 58.

05:31.820 --> 05:37.970
But this was very easily this can be easily done if the row values to what, eight or whatever and is

05:37.970 --> 05:46.310
three, then will we sit and partition them like zero from first one from this like zero zero and B

05:46.670 --> 05:51.040
or we can see one and zero B minus one eight.

05:51.230 --> 05:55.820
I mean, there are multiple, then there will be many ways to partition this rate.

05:55.820 --> 06:01.700
So how many whether they are to partition P in the sum of some numbers, we have already seen this.

06:01.850 --> 06:05.630
We have already seen this example and we have all this problem, right?

06:05.900 --> 06:09.650
But that can be the brute force solution that will work, if anything equal to three.

06:09.650 --> 06:14.600
You can try out all the particular combinations and permutations.

06:15.230 --> 06:15.550
Eight.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.760
Now watch this again.

06:18.850 --> 06:25.050
Part of the second part of it is a dynamic programming solution for how to apply dynamic programming

06:25.050 --> 06:25.320
in this.

06:25.320 --> 06:29.790
So we always know we'll have a state and then still state will represent again.

06:30.130 --> 06:31.050
We have the second.

06:32.410 --> 06:32.670
Yeah.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.330
So in this case, we have vanity.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.230
I don't know.

06:35.230 --> 06:39.400
You can see for yourself how we are getting when it I think we are getting it from.

06:40.160 --> 06:44.050
So we have to pick up three plates ready to this 80 plus eighties.

06:45.920 --> 06:48.920
160 and this one will give me 188.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.650
So that's the answer for this second case.

06:52.170 --> 06:56.600
Let let me let's let us think how to apply dynamic programming in this.

06:56.990 --> 07:04.490
Eight What we do is firstly we have a prefix that let's let, let's keep a prefix added because if I

07:04.490 --> 07:08.480
am picking up some number of plates in them, then I can only pick up some.

07:09.960 --> 07:10.890
But it picks up the pace.

07:11.250 --> 07:15.600
So it will be ten, 21, 20 and 150.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.320
So this is pretty quick.

07:16.350 --> 07:19.890
Some of the faster this will be, 80 plus 50 is one.

07:19.890 --> 07:22.410
30 plus ten is one.

07:22.410 --> 07:23.730
40 plus 50 is.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.430
What is plus 5190.

07:28.450 --> 07:30.340
So sometimes it happens.

07:30.840 --> 07:33.730
So here you can see that finally.

07:33.940 --> 07:39.990
So basically what we want is finally we can see the sum is nothing but 120 plus one third rate.

07:41.710 --> 07:42.060
Correct.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.990
So let's define a deep state here.

07:44.350 --> 07:46.790
So this is an introduction of the partition problems.

07:46.810 --> 07:52.150
All the partition problems will be solving it in this way where we have to partition here we are partitioning

07:52.150 --> 07:53.740
to drain to some number of.

07:55.490 --> 07:56.120
Partitions.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.160
Because this is a partition.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.090
This is a partition.

07:59.540 --> 08:04.760
And in future, we'll also see some one D areas which can be divided into some partitions.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.770
And there are very beautiful problems from those.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.870
So we'll see all of them one by one.

08:08.870 --> 08:12.520
And this is a very interesting problems will be solved today.

08:13.370 --> 08:20.360
So here you can see this is a positive of right now let's define a DP State, let's say DP.

08:21.640 --> 08:21.940
Okay.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.480
Let's say DP are you gonna do this?

08:25.480 --> 08:27.550
Means what is the.

08:28.180 --> 08:29.510
Okay, what is the answer?

08:29.530 --> 08:34.470
So here the answer will be nothing but the maximum total sum of your value.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.000
Let me define it over here.

08:38.100 --> 08:42.960
EPA will be nothing but the maximum total sum of beauty value.

08:43.530 --> 08:48.330
Maximum total sum of beauty value.

08:51.530 --> 08:54.140
Then Dr. Patel can pick if.

08:55.510 --> 08:57.640
Or let's say, from.

09:00.630 --> 09:01.290
I rose.

09:03.420 --> 09:03.680
Eight.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.180
And.

09:07.300 --> 09:07.990
Considering.

09:10.490 --> 09:11.000
Total.

09:12.220 --> 09:12.970
Giblets.

09:15.170 --> 09:18.230
The word is maximum mobility value from the first dose.

09:18.380 --> 09:20.090
If I consider total giblets.

09:20.330 --> 09:23.360
So what will be the final answer that Dr. Patel wants?

09:23.390 --> 09:25.520
Dr. Patel wants deep end coma.

09:27.650 --> 09:35.230
Be ready because this is what is the total number of rows and this is what is the total number of plates?

09:35.840 --> 09:36.080
Correct.

09:36.680 --> 09:37.460
Now, let's see.

09:37.640 --> 09:41.000
I hope you understood this deep eight.

09:41.240 --> 09:46.220
And believe me or not, this is the state that I picked up from the problem itself.

09:46.260 --> 09:46.520
Right.

09:46.520 --> 09:52.890
So I or what I always do is I make whatever the problem is asking, I just make it I state aid.

09:53.330 --> 09:59.300
But if I'm picking up eight rows and considering the first 8 hours and considering the total duplicates,

09:59.300 --> 10:01.010
then what's my answer?

10:01.120 --> 10:05.390
I mean, let's try to fill the deep values and then you'll realize it yourself.

10:07.430 --> 10:13.500
It will start with the base case to make, to understand the problem deeper, to get familiar with it.

10:14.090 --> 10:15.780
But let's let's call it one.

10:17.020 --> 10:17.680
One.

10:17.920 --> 10:21.290
Okay, so there can be a case when I'm picking up zero bullets, right?

10:21.320 --> 10:22.600
So let me write that case.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.420
Also, zero plates, one plate to plate.

10:25.420 --> 10:26.110
Really appropriate.

10:26.110 --> 10:27.580
So basically I'm just making this.

10:30.050 --> 10:35.460
Able with an grasp of and grasp rates of what is be here is five.

10:35.480 --> 10:41.510
So I have to make one more partition which is five eight and this is one comma.

10:43.620 --> 10:43.710
Do.

10:44.330 --> 10:50.510
Tell me, what if I pick up zero plates on the first of what will be my answer if I'm picking up?

10:50.860 --> 10:54.670
Right now we're just talking about first ideas, which is the first only aid.

10:54.710 --> 11:00.260
So if I'm picking up zero plates, that means down to this very simple relative zero or then picking

11:00.260 --> 11:01.100
up the first plate.

11:01.700 --> 11:02.240
Let me right.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.130
The index is here also.

11:06.860 --> 11:07.160
So.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.200
One, two, three, four.

11:10.140 --> 11:10.770
And.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.380
One two, eight.

11:15.010 --> 11:19.600
If I'm picking up the phone, if I have to pick up one player from the first row, then you have to

11:19.600 --> 11:22.000
pick up duplicates from the first row.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.470
That means this value 20 because I cannot pick up any other player, I have to pick up the first two

11:26.470 --> 11:26.770
players.

11:27.190 --> 11:32.440
As we can see in the first row in the fourth player, we have 150 now.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.630
Can we pick up the fifth player from the first row?

11:34.930 --> 11:35.500
Not yet.

11:36.010 --> 11:38.530
I'll just market you very well.

11:38.530 --> 11:39.940
Let's come back over here.

11:41.070 --> 11:46.020
So indeed for the first two rows now we are talking about we are considering for the first two rows,

11:46.320 --> 11:51.990
for the first three roads, what is the best way to pick up the zero played zero bridge total rate.

11:51.990 --> 11:52.920
So it will be zero.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.430
The maximum value when picking up zero plates from the first road is zero.

11:57.060 --> 12:03.720
What if now, now, now is a good now we're moving to a good solution that let's fill this place, which

12:03.720 --> 12:07.650
is to command one, which means from the first few rows.

12:07.950 --> 12:09.750
What if you select only one plate?

12:11.020 --> 12:11.290
Right.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.620
They're not telling me these are the current rule.

12:14.920 --> 12:19.330
If I talk about for the current rule, the second rule, what options do I have to pick up?

12:19.390 --> 12:23.950
Total number of one plate from all the rows two for the current row.

12:23.950 --> 12:30.190
We know that the total number of options that we have is that I'll pick zero plates from the first round,

12:30.190 --> 12:36.700
pick one plate from the above row, or I can pick up one plate from the first row, but one plate from

12:36.700 --> 12:40.330
the current row and zero plates from the questions.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.710
But if that means.

12:43.860 --> 12:47.790
In short, what I'm trying to say is, what if I pick up?

12:50.160 --> 12:51.060
Let's call it.

12:51.930 --> 12:52.200
Okay.

12:52.210 --> 12:55.170
I'll stick and stick and stick an X.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.480
Let's call it a.

12:57.150 --> 13:01.280
What if I pick x number of plates from the current group?

13:02.740 --> 13:03.070
Right.

13:03.370 --> 13:04.360
Ah, okay.

13:04.390 --> 13:09.940
Let's just talk about this example only, which is to come on day, I want a big advantage.

13:10.060 --> 13:15.490
So I'll pick up either one blade, zero blade from the current row, or I can pick up one blade from

13:15.490 --> 13:16.430
the current.

13:17.710 --> 13:18.070
But it.

13:19.670 --> 13:23.610
So if I'm picking up zero plate from the current road, that means I have to pick up one.

13:23.610 --> 13:29.460
-0 is one bit from the previous routes where the towns are kept before any.

13:29.850 --> 13:34.170
So here we can see the transit escaped over here that from the previous routes.

13:34.170 --> 13:40.050
Tell me, what is the best cost of picking one route, one bullet resistant, and what is the best cost

13:40.050 --> 13:42.870
of picking zero blade from the current is zero.

13:42.900 --> 13:45.350
So what is vendor zero will get then?

13:45.840 --> 13:51.300
Now the second part of the problem is that what if I'm picking up one blade from the current row and

13:51.510 --> 13:52.860
then I'm asking one minus?

13:53.890 --> 13:55.120
One will be zero at eight.

13:55.450 --> 13:58.080
I have to pick up zero plates from the previous rows.

13:58.240 --> 14:01.720
So basically I have two options that I'll pick up this.

14:02.910 --> 14:09.950
Which is giving me ten and this which is giving me the cost of making one plate from the current reality

14:09.990 --> 14:12.630
and the cost of picking zero plate from the previous process.

14:13.690 --> 14:15.420
Zero zero is 80.

14:15.430 --> 14:16.870
So what is the mix of them?

14:17.170 --> 14:17.770
It is 80.

14:18.900 --> 14:19.240
Rick.

14:19.530 --> 14:22.440
Let's move one step ahead and then the things will become very clear.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.330
Let's let Phil do coma.

14:27.310 --> 14:28.600
What is two words to Gamma?

14:28.600 --> 14:29.110
Two means.

14:29.140 --> 14:30.970
It means from the first two.

14:31.270 --> 14:31.810
Pick up two.

14:32.170 --> 14:33.370
One of the best cos eight.

14:33.550 --> 14:34.840
So the first thing is very simple.

14:35.050 --> 14:38.950
Either pick up zero plates from the current row and pick up two plates from the.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.270
Bust previous rules.

14:41.390 --> 14:42.730
Rachel, this is previous rules.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.660
Where is the transit hub?

14:44.660 --> 14:47.360
The best answer to pick up to bridge on the previous roads.

14:47.510 --> 14:49.970
It is kept over here with is 28.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.510
So this will be zero plus 20 and it is 28.

14:53.870 --> 14:59.350
The second part is other pick up one player from the current room because see, it's very simple to

14:59.360 --> 15:02.480
just try out my possible options for the current row.

15:02.750 --> 15:05.150
And then as for the other options for the previous rows.

15:05.870 --> 15:09.940
The second option that I have is pick up one player from the current group rate.

15:09.980 --> 15:12.380
And what is the cost of picking a bundle from the current?

15:12.500 --> 15:13.070
It is 80.

15:15.040 --> 15:22.060
And pick up one plate from the above room, which is above Bruce Ray which is the best answer this and

15:22.240 --> 15:22.660
they tell it.

15:22.970 --> 15:30.150
Dennis 93rd option is at pick up two plates from the current row and pick up zero plates from the previous

15:30.150 --> 15:30.400
throws.

15:30.910 --> 15:39.100
This picking up to plate from the current draw will be will give me a cost of 138 and what is the best

15:39.100 --> 15:44.890
answer if I pick up zero based on the above rows, it's zero eight and this gives me 130.

15:44.890 --> 15:47.410
So what is the maximum on these three options that I have?

15:47.770 --> 15:49.990
So what up for total plates of two?

15:49.990 --> 15:52.420
I cannot write the big three plates.

15:52.420 --> 15:52.650
Right.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.390
I just have to pick up admixture plate one.

15:55.540 --> 15:57.190
So the maximum limit is 130.

15:57.760 --> 15:58.950
We just plated 130.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.360
So what does 130 means from the first two rows?

16:02.050 --> 16:04.270
From the first two rows, what is the best?

16:05.750 --> 16:10.460
Maximum beauty validity can get by picking up Taurus who believes it is 130?

16:10.460 --> 16:12.050
And how are we getting this?

16:12.260 --> 16:14.900
By picking up these to let it be in 50.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.610
I hope you're getting the whole point.

16:17.620 --> 16:18.300
You think?

16:19.470 --> 16:25.230
Well, let's try the and then we'll generalize it later and just trying to fill the next.

16:26.410 --> 16:26.860
Column.

16:27.490 --> 16:34.150
So the next columnist two or three so far Tacoma commodity I'll pick up either one either zero leads

16:34.150 --> 16:39.400
from the current row, three from the previous odd one plus two from the previous order.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.630
It's not about the previous two, it is about the previous rows.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.890
So this is Tacoma one and the third one is three.

16:47.890 --> 16:50.140
Comma zero, the 403.

16:51.390 --> 16:57.870
It is zero plus the best chance of opening three lanes on the previous route is 120.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.000
This is 120.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.100
This one is of 80 plus.

17:04.630 --> 17:06.190
20, which is hundred.

17:07.090 --> 17:11.830
This is 130 plus picking up one will be ten.

17:11.830 --> 17:12.870
It is 140.

17:12.880 --> 17:13.350
Okay.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.260
And this one is.

17:17.540 --> 17:23.470
The will be 140 and picking up zero from the previous roses zero.

17:23.650 --> 17:25.000
So this is also 140.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.740
So what are the best one, everyone?

17:27.430 --> 17:28.330
The best one here.

17:28.330 --> 17:32.530
I can see if I want to pick up three plates from the above.

17:32.530 --> 17:34.090
Two rows is 148.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.730
Well, let me read one, but let's check.

17:36.730 --> 17:38.290
How are we getting 140?

17:38.860 --> 17:40.930
It can be a people 50 plus ten.

17:43.210 --> 17:44.350
30 plus 50 plus ten.

17:44.410 --> 17:44.950
I got it.

17:45.410 --> 17:45.550
I.

17:46.620 --> 17:48.750
Let's quickly build one comma for.

17:50.290 --> 17:54.010
Well, I know it's a very short example, but it's taking time.

17:54.580 --> 17:56.020
Let's just fill up on God.

17:56.680 --> 18:00.250
CUOMO 42, very simple zero from the current forum.

18:00.250 --> 18:06.070
The previous this is 151 from the current, three from previous.

18:06.070 --> 18:12.460
This is 80 plus 80 plus 1/20 200.

18:13.750 --> 18:14.050
So.

18:15.890 --> 18:16.660
And.

18:18.250 --> 18:24.370
The next one can be two from the current and two from the previous, two from Greenville.

18:24.370 --> 18:27.250
Will you give me 130 and you from previous will give me.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.370
128.

18:31.390 --> 18:32.600
So it will be only 150.

18:33.790 --> 18:34.100
Rick.

18:34.450 --> 18:36.280
So it is this 30 plus destroying thing.

18:36.820 --> 18:43.030
And finally, the last one will be not the last three plus one and the last one before +08.

18:43.180 --> 18:44.680
The formula zero is very simple.

18:44.680 --> 18:52.180
Let me just I did it is 198 but what is three +13 from the current which is 140 and one from previous

18:52.180 --> 18:52.780
with just ten.

18:53.230 --> 18:55.690
It will also give me 150 towards the best.

18:55.690 --> 18:56.470
It is 200.

18:58.260 --> 19:00.690
They finally literally lost value.

19:01.670 --> 19:02.120
And.

19:04.130 --> 19:05.990
This is 208.

19:06.470 --> 19:10.010
Now let's fill this, which is the p to coma.

19:11.220 --> 19:13.130
I cannot fill zero comma five.

19:14.270 --> 19:15.740
I can I cannot fill zero.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.690
But I can fill the one coma for and it's full.

19:18.830 --> 19:21.590
Zero, comma zero plus five is not possible.

19:21.590 --> 19:25.610
I cannot pick up five because it will be zero.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.470
The second one is one comma.

19:28.480 --> 19:32.860
Or to picking up one from this list it and picking up for it.

19:33.070 --> 19:36.790
The best answer is 150 to 150 as it is.

19:37.150 --> 19:37.490
Those are.

19:38.810 --> 19:45.570
Similarly to go my three will give me picking up two is 130 and picking up three from the previous or

19:45.600 --> 19:46.250
this 120.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.210
So basically it is better.

19:47.210 --> 19:48.620
The best from is 258.

19:49.070 --> 19:54.050
I hope you can see how is the best answer to 50 coming up over here.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.040
But what we are doing is nothing.

19:57.060 --> 19:58.800
Let me just generalize it now.

19:59.340 --> 19:59.580
What?

19:59.580 --> 20:00.590
Any idea?

20:01.820 --> 20:02.930
DPA comedy.

20:02.930 --> 20:08.630
What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to let's say I'm trying to run X, not some Asian.

20:08.630 --> 20:16.850
It will be max it's a let's take max of the first option is either pick up one to pick up zero from

20:16.850 --> 20:19.390
the current one or two or three and so until keep.

20:20.320 --> 20:20.620
Eight.

20:20.950 --> 20:26.290
So what I'll do is I'll run in X, let's see, x goes from zero and x go still.

20:28.630 --> 20:28.930
They?

20:30.360 --> 20:36.870
And what we'll do is we'll simply say that it is nothing, but it is equals to a maximum of.

20:38.580 --> 20:40.670
Big eggs from the current row.

20:41.070 --> 20:43.440
So what is what is the picking eggs from the current draw?

20:43.470 --> 20:47.370
It is nothing but prefix of the current row which is i.e..

20:49.000 --> 20:51.160
Farmer X This is the perfect template.

20:51.160 --> 20:59.230
I'm just writing it as prefix i x which is prefix fix of x plates of the grain do less dpi i.e. minus

20:59.230 --> 20:59.500
one.

21:00.970 --> 21:08.380
And D minus X, but that means picking J minus X from the previous rules.

21:09.600 --> 21:14.880
As simple as that Reid and I it for all sides in this I will go from one to win and they will go from

21:15.510 --> 21:16.950
zero to be eight.

21:17.220 --> 21:18.870
So in the next part, we'll just call it out.

21:18.870 --> 21:21.900
I hope you understood how the transitions in this are being made.

21:22.590 --> 21:24.270
Eight and yeah.

21:24.540 --> 21:24.900
Thank you.
