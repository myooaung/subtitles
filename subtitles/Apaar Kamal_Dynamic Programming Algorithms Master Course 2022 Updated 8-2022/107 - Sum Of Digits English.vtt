00:00.440 --> 00:00.710
Hello.

00:00.710 --> 00:01.470
Run it.

00:01.520 --> 00:03.230
Solve this problem from sponge.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.990
And now you can not easily solve this problem.

00:05.990 --> 00:08.690
It's very easy than the previous problem.

00:10.820 --> 00:13.220
Yeah, there's not much variables involved in this.

00:13.850 --> 00:14.270
So let's.

00:14.270 --> 00:15.590
Let's take this problem and.

00:16.540 --> 00:17.950
So you can do this.

00:18.550 --> 00:18.910
So.

00:20.260 --> 00:23.410
His teacher asking to calculate the sum of numbers from one division.

00:23.650 --> 00:29.350
It's very easy writing in prison, but now is teaching medium and in challenge.

00:29.350 --> 00:35.920
And he asks my dad to calculate some of digits of numbers.

00:35.920 --> 00:36.640
One through in.

00:38.060 --> 00:44.170
To basically notice some of digit eight, for example, from one end and the numbers are 1 to 10.

00:44.180 --> 00:44.540
Right.

00:44.990 --> 00:50.450
And the total number of digits from 1 to 945 and ten is one plus zero.

00:50.480 --> 00:53.090
It will it will add 1 to 45 and give me 46.

00:53.340 --> 00:56.090
It is some of the digits of the numbers in a particular range.

00:56.930 --> 01:00.620
The ranges are A and B, as you can see, and B is not mentioned anywhere in the problem.

01:00.620 --> 01:04.010
But now you can easily understand what A and B represents here.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.720
So let's quickly go this relate a normal recursion.

01:08.540 --> 01:08.840
Yeah.

01:08.960 --> 01:16.160
So one more thing before moving forward, I hope now by reading this part of the course you can easily

01:16.160 --> 01:24.350
form your because of relations can easily formulate the state of deep state and memorizing the term

01:24.350 --> 01:24.800
quickly.

01:24.830 --> 01:25.640
Quoting it now.

01:27.220 --> 01:27.760
Initially.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.050
What we have, we have.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.100
Okay, let's do Vivan.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.990
This will keep on going until we have the termination case.

01:35.170 --> 01:40.540
It will terminate when the NBA minus eight or let's say, a p e.

01:42.160 --> 01:48.430
And if it goes to minus one and B goes to minus one, it will break.

01:49.060 --> 01:53.320
Otherwise, what it will do is let's write a function called solve.

01:53.860 --> 01:57.730
It will solve will be and it will end solidly minus one.

01:59.930 --> 02:01.500
And it will bring the difference.

02:02.130 --> 02:04.490
Well, guys, I hope this is very easy.

02:04.490 --> 02:06.350
Will certainly be a minus one subject.

02:07.190 --> 02:08.660
No, it can.

02:08.660 --> 02:09.350
Batteries.

02:09.440 --> 02:09.850
It's right.

02:09.860 --> 02:10.940
Dysfunction solve.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.940
In golf it will take.

02:16.020 --> 02:17.370
Very well call and.

02:18.510 --> 02:19.860
And now what I do is nothing.

02:19.860 --> 02:26.610
But you think what other people do is you going to try those approaches, which is to convert this into

02:26.610 --> 02:27.420
a vector form.

02:27.990 --> 02:32.250
So each element of the vector will contain the digit of this number eight.

02:32.550 --> 02:40.450
And then what they do is they reverse the vector because the way of because the way in which the numbers

02:40.470 --> 02:45.390
are the number takes the opposite or the rate they they do is they take more.

02:45.390 --> 02:49.440
By then they divide it and more better and divide it arduously.

02:49.770 --> 02:56.580
So what what happens is the last digit of the number towards in the vector, you can also you can of

02:56.580 --> 03:02.190
course, you can look around some very good solutions of the GDP or just I'm just giving you the best

03:02.190 --> 03:04.340
solution out there, which is using strings.

03:04.980 --> 03:05.190
Okay.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.410
And because it is easy to handle them.

03:08.260 --> 03:09.020
Right return.

03:09.040 --> 03:13.210
It's got a legislative function called DP in this function, which is.

03:14.380 --> 03:14.880
AP.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.320
What I'll do is I'll, I'll, of course have an index.

03:17.360 --> 03:23.380
I keep all the digits here in this index that contains Boolean laws.

03:24.250 --> 03:29.260
And the third is from no rate because now are doing it in this total sum.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.830
So index zero bullion is true.

03:32.830 --> 03:35.680
Some is zero are filling the base cases.

03:37.660 --> 03:39.040
Oh, yeah.

03:39.070 --> 03:40.780
Now what is the basis of the regression?

03:41.320 --> 03:42.820
So simple if index.

03:43.450 --> 03:43.780
Okay.

03:43.900 --> 03:47.110
So this and I won't initialized it.

03:47.650 --> 03:48.970
Initialize it fast.

03:49.270 --> 03:49.390
Yeah.

03:49.870 --> 03:57.220
If your index is equal to end or size, that means I have these the end of the tree tree.

03:57.580 --> 03:58.390
The that tree.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.960
In the same time I'm formulating some eight.

04:02.110 --> 04:04.480
So what I'll do is I simply return this some here.

04:05.170 --> 04:05.890
And what is this some.

04:05.890 --> 04:08.660
This is some of digits normal right now.

04:08.890 --> 04:12.520
Let me quickly write still and you'll know what it is.

04:13.510 --> 04:17.380
But it is an index miners who.

04:19.140 --> 04:21.310
Otherwise it will be fine.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.270
And the next is.

04:27.470 --> 04:27.730
Yep.

04:28.130 --> 04:29.000
The next is.

04:30.610 --> 04:31.300
Digits.

04:32.080 --> 04:40.840
And this digit will go to l, l or whatever the value is it it's on the variable called answer and answer

04:40.840 --> 04:41.860
will do nothing more.

04:41.860 --> 04:46.780
Just, you know, try and please the digital, the current location and call for the next you shouldn't.

04:47.410 --> 04:48.970
It is the index plus one.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.060
Our last is nothing but last.

04:52.690 --> 04:58.210
And if digits is equals to we, we all know this.

04:58.570 --> 05:01.090
What is some sum is nothing but some plus digit.

05:01.330 --> 05:06.370
We are placing a certain digit over at a particular location and we will just take it into some.

05:07.420 --> 05:09.370
Finally, let's return to the answer.

05:10.180 --> 05:15.520
Some of you might be wondering that of whatever the problem that we are until now in the GDP.

05:16.060 --> 05:17.560
Most of it is same rate.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.380
This thing is same, filing is same.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.600
Adding memory is same.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.390
This this line is exactly similar.

05:25.780 --> 05:28.330
This case will change a little bit depending on the.

05:29.270 --> 05:30.830
Variables that we are passing over here.

05:31.490 --> 05:32.900
And this is all true.

05:32.900 --> 05:33.740
Almost same rate.

05:34.010 --> 05:39.110
All you can do is you can make a snippet of desert tape that you did.

05:39.170 --> 05:40.820
Things will be there in the GDP.

05:40.820 --> 05:44.180
So whenever you solve a problem, you don't have to always start from zero.

05:44.690 --> 05:47.330
You can always start from this snippet.

05:48.590 --> 05:55.100
But for your first five problems, I would suggest start from zero and try to write all of this so that

05:55.100 --> 05:56.470
it is in your mind.

05:56.480 --> 05:56.760
Right.

05:57.530 --> 06:00.050
And then let me build this.

06:02.880 --> 06:03.210
Okay.

06:03.210 --> 06:06.470
So what I'm getting, I'm reading 46 and age 65.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.380
Is it true?

06:07.500 --> 06:07.800
Yeah.

06:07.830 --> 06:08.310
46.

06:08.310 --> 06:08.820
85.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.850
Now, it was very easy.

06:12.300 --> 06:18.330
Now, tell me how many different variables ah, the index will go to in size.

06:18.350 --> 06:20.070
And is how much longer do stand.

06:20.070 --> 06:20.760
Is two by nine.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.260
Basically nine, ten digits long.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.850
Let's take ten digits long.

06:23.850 --> 06:24.180
Right.

06:24.810 --> 06:31.680
So let me at minimum the stand digit wrong last will have two variables and what will some have goes

06:32.160 --> 06:36.240
it will have it makes it can be nine, nine, nine right everywhere.

06:36.780 --> 06:38.580
So it is nine and do ten.

06:38.580 --> 06:39.270
It is 90.

06:39.570 --> 06:40.500
Let's dig 90.

06:41.390 --> 06:43.070
Well, ma'am, so did.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.640
By minus one and more.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.440
Comma, minus one comma, Faisal.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.260
I hope this is clear.

06:54.190 --> 06:54.490
Eight.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.840
And finally.

06:57.810 --> 06:58.500
I will.

07:00.330 --> 07:01.620
This also need to do.

07:03.060 --> 07:03.870
Last.

07:03.870 --> 07:06.870
And some memories are amazing.

07:06.870 --> 07:07.620
It is.

07:10.290 --> 07:18.870
And with this, if I'm this inarticulate and you've done this, I hope this is very clear.

07:19.790 --> 07:20.060
Well.

07:21.210 --> 07:22.650
So let me bring in this again.

07:24.840 --> 07:25.570
Great advice.

07:25.890 --> 07:27.120
So thank you, everyone.

07:27.480 --> 07:31.320
This was a very simple, the simplest of the digital debris problem.

07:31.320 --> 07:31.560
Eight.

07:32.130 --> 07:36.570
I we industry this as well will also solve some other good problems.

07:38.310 --> 07:38.640
Thanks.
