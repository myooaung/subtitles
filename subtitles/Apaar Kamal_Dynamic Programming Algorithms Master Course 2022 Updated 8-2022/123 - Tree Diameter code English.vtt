WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:00.780
I will.

00:01.110 --> 00:01.800
Welcome back.

00:02.090 --> 00:06.360
So let's quickly go to the approach that we discussed for the diameter.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.730
It's fine this F and g functions.

00:10.080 --> 00:10.410
So.

00:11.720 --> 00:12.120
Um.

00:12.440 --> 00:12.710
Yeah.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.330
So this is the normal input.

00:14.330 --> 00:14.420
It.

00:14.420 --> 00:16.130
I already assumed.

00:16.700 --> 00:17.200
And.

00:19.710 --> 00:20.790
So the input is done.

00:20.790 --> 00:22.680
And what I need to do is just say, Davis.

00:23.430 --> 00:24.930
What I'll do is I'll perform Davis.

00:24.930 --> 00:29.130
I can do one as a rule, not as minus one as it's apparent initially.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.870
So let's just perform a normal day of this.

00:32.310 --> 00:36.900
There are two ways we can solve it using via Facebook and solve it using DFS.

00:36.900 --> 00:42.660
We can already using because then with memorisation we can try all three approaches.

00:42.660 --> 00:45.720
But I'm going with the DFS approach because.

00:47.040 --> 00:51.630
That's what we should be doing because that's the most easiest approach.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.090
Otherwise, it's completely your choice.

00:55.270 --> 00:56.950
Whatever you want to do.

00:56.980 --> 00:58.320
You can write.

00:59.910 --> 01:00.080
So.

01:00.150 --> 01:01.200
All right, know what's happening?

01:01.620 --> 01:03.450
This is normal DFS.

01:03.720 --> 01:04.920
So what does DFS do?

01:05.280 --> 01:05.670
Nothing.

01:05.670 --> 01:07.230
But it will just perform.

01:08.190 --> 01:11.530
A normal of people on their DFS overall.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.210
They got it.

01:12.510 --> 01:17.280
Now let's take two areas, which is F and and E and rate.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.440
And we have defined F and G your video.

01:20.600 --> 01:21.290
Very different.

01:21.590 --> 01:21.830
Yeah.

01:22.310 --> 01:24.930
If so closely.

01:24.950 --> 01:27.470
Let's get clear of any node.

01:28.780 --> 01:40.530
And so far decoded is nothing but max of the X +182 basically let me just correct.

01:41.880 --> 01:42.120
Well.

01:42.330 --> 01:47.100
So for all the values of its children, plus one will be d d.

01:47.970 --> 01:51.510
If the x is zero, then it will automatically take one value.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.430
And what's the second thing?

01:54.150 --> 01:56.010
In Italy, f India filled with zero eight.

01:56.340 --> 01:57.270
And what is the second thing?

01:57.270 --> 01:58.020
What is F?

01:59.910 --> 02:00.180
Yeah.

02:00.210 --> 02:08.670
What if current afternoon it is nothing but two plus max two values of 684 How can I take max two values

02:08.670 --> 02:10.800
index one very simple.

02:10.860 --> 02:18.790
Just take a vector push back these values just push back the values in the vector start the vector in

02:18.810 --> 02:22.350
the reverse manner and just take two plus the first two values.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.160
And what can be the second part here?

02:26.310 --> 02:31.080
If I don't want to use Vector and I don't want some extra space, I can just take two variables.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.500
It's called Max one and Max two.

02:35.220 --> 02:38.550
So initially we'll just formulate them zero and five.

02:38.760 --> 02:43.230
And after performing the DFS, what I do them, what I would see, I would simply say that F of current

02:43.230 --> 02:45.000
is nothing but the.

02:45.990 --> 02:46.500
Oh, yeah.

02:46.950 --> 02:50.310
Duplass Max of OnePlus.

02:50.310 --> 02:51.450
Max of two.

02:52.620 --> 02:56.480
Correct because Max and Max two will have the maximum to valued objects.

02:56.930 --> 02:57.100
Right.

02:57.510 --> 03:01.020
How can I store the maximum to values objects?

03:02.020 --> 03:07.810
Think about it, and it will be very easy if you try a simple approach.

03:08.290 --> 03:08.620
Yep.

03:08.650 --> 03:10.240
So very simple.

03:10.540 --> 03:15.190
What we do is we just keep two variables called max one and Max two.

03:15.760 --> 03:22.570
So let's say the values of these two variables on a number line of this, initially the values is values

03:22.570 --> 03:22.890
zero.

03:22.900 --> 03:28.450
But I'm just taking a case where the values are, let's say one and then 800, sorry.

03:29.230 --> 03:31.420
Did it in a reverse manner.

03:31.570 --> 03:31.840
Yeah.

03:32.140 --> 03:34.390
So this is Max two and this is maximum only two.

03:34.390 --> 03:36.220
This is standards and it is one.

03:36.970 --> 03:38.710
So let's say new value comes and.

03:39.970 --> 03:46.900
It is greater than max when nature if the value is greater than max, when it is equal to 28.

03:47.110 --> 03:54.580
So what I would say is that Max one is equal to this value eight And before marking Max, when it equal

03:54.580 --> 03:57.910
to this value, I'll just see that max two is equal to maximum.

03:58.890 --> 04:01.380
Correct because I knew we're looking at 20.

04:01.380 --> 04:02.430
So Max, when should we?

04:02.430 --> 04:04.190
20 and max we should be ten.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.150
So I will perform these two steps.

04:06.450 --> 04:07.620
The second phase can be there.

04:07.630 --> 04:09.720
The value lies between Max one and Max two.

04:10.260 --> 04:15.060
In this second case, the second case max one won't change eight.

04:15.060 --> 04:17.700
So if the maximum won't change, then I can simply.

04:18.640 --> 04:23.470
Not change it and simply say that Max, too, is equal to this value.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.320
It's one one separate because we don't have a change max one.

04:27.670 --> 04:30.700
And what is the third case if the value is less than max two.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.880
If the values less in max two, then what we can do is.

04:34.950 --> 04:35.580
Impolite.

04:37.410 --> 04:42.360
Not do anything because if the values lesson makes true, then Max, when released in Max one and Max

04:42.360 --> 04:44.090
two, will still be max to eight.

04:44.370 --> 04:45.600
Let me quickly quote that.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.550
I will simply say if.

04:47.970 --> 04:49.950
Yeah, for what?

04:50.100 --> 04:50.310
Yeah.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.260
We want to find out the max two values of this.

04:53.610 --> 05:01.890
That's implicit if D of X is greater than max one.

05:03.100 --> 05:13.090
Then what I will do is I simply mark Max who is equal to max one eight and see that max one is equal

05:13.090 --> 05:14.950
to g of x.

05:15.990 --> 05:16.380
Correct.

05:17.040 --> 05:23.040
And the second thing is else, if D X is greater than Max.

05:24.050 --> 05:24.250
Okay.

05:24.510 --> 05:27.590
So if the new value that came to me is greater than only Max two.

05:27.790 --> 05:28.080
Right.

05:28.320 --> 05:33.000
And of course, it will be less than maximum, because that's why we are in the active case in this.

05:33.000 --> 05:33.360
Give us.

05:33.450 --> 05:36.300
What I'll do is that it's implicit in max twins equals two G of x.

05:37.470 --> 05:38.940
So in this order, what we'll do is.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.440
Performative is on stick.

05:41.880 --> 05:44.580
This is just calculating deal for the current value.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.940
It be for the current node.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.840
And now by using this method, we can find out the max.

05:51.840 --> 05:52.380
Two values.

05:53.070 --> 05:55.440
Max two values of.

05:56.410 --> 06:03.820
DEEKS So if if there are let's say if there's only one download, that means that we'll take the max

06:03.820 --> 06:05.680
one and max two will be zero.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.410
So in the end, what will happen max when less?

06:10.510 --> 06:11.150
Do they?

06:11.170 --> 06:14.200
So in this case, we have plus two.

06:15.250 --> 06:15.490
No.

06:15.490 --> 06:15.820
Right.

06:16.030 --> 06:16.350
Why?

06:16.580 --> 06:18.100
Because two wins for.

06:19.650 --> 06:21.450
These what we see.

06:22.110 --> 06:22.380
Yeah.

06:22.710 --> 06:26.150
So two is actually connecting to subseries of it.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.860
So what if there are no two subjects?

06:28.860 --> 06:30.840
Eight and the first case can be.

06:30.870 --> 06:32.820
What if it's a download rate to follow?

06:32.820 --> 06:36.570
A download F of current cannot be equal to to eight.

06:37.260 --> 06:40.170
Do something wrong in the solution right now.

06:40.560 --> 06:40.870
Correct.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.600
I hope you are understanding the whole point.

06:43.080 --> 06:48.270
It Max one is the longer distance max two is the second longest is and we are connecting them.

06:49.120 --> 06:53.880
So instead of saying this, what we can do is I can quickly change it.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.000
We can quickly change this part.

06:57.930 --> 07:04.380
And what I can say is in this part, I can simply say it, Max, two values of X plus one.

07:05.730 --> 07:06.630
Just think about this.

07:06.780 --> 07:07.440
Will this work?

07:07.710 --> 07:09.210
Max, two of the explosion.

07:09.580 --> 07:09.740
What?

07:09.750 --> 07:17.820
And you know what I'm saying is find it the X values and do a plus one and take max two values and add

07:17.820 --> 07:18.030
them.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.010
Yeah, I think that will work.

07:22.010 --> 07:22.310
Great.

07:22.310 --> 07:24.980
So add Max to values of the.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.410
Okay, so let's do this then.

07:27.590 --> 07:31.430
Let's add the maximum two values of the X plus one instead of the x.

07:31.790 --> 07:39.230
Let me write the x plus one, do x plus one plus one and this will be maximum.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.680
Now, let's think of a case when there is no change.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.850
So it's a if it's a leaf, not of this.

07:45.860 --> 07:46.870
If will never work.

07:47.770 --> 07:52.330
Max Wind and Max will remain zero and the diameter will be zero.

07:52.330 --> 07:52.870
That's correct.

07:53.620 --> 07:54.880
What if there's only one tail?

07:55.090 --> 07:57.370
So if there's only one tail max, one will be failed.

07:57.370 --> 07:58.650
Only max two will be zero.

07:58.660 --> 08:04.060
And what will max when contain it will contain one plus order type.

08:04.450 --> 08:08.440
So that will be the diameter or the sorry, not the diameter but the length of the.

08:08.890 --> 08:11.420
But then what we want in effect eight.

08:11.710 --> 08:15.400
And if there are two or more children, then it's very simple.

08:16.450 --> 08:17.560
Maxim does makes it right.

08:17.590 --> 08:19.630
I think this should work and we build it once.

08:20.670 --> 08:21.210
And.

08:23.100 --> 08:23.820
Okay.

08:26.580 --> 08:26.730
Okay.

08:27.000 --> 08:27.450
So.

08:28.670 --> 08:33.320
Finally we have performed DFS and DFS has filled all the values.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.510
What I do is I will simply print F of one.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.310
What does every one contain?

08:37.580 --> 08:39.770
Because they started the DFS from the root.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.000
Not before this.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.340
See 12131425225, three, six.

08:46.340 --> 08:48.840
And the length of the longest bodies for.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.650
Yeah you can imagine it and you can also see it.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.840
So we have found the values.

08:54.350 --> 09:00.110
This is what we'll be doing in the future problem or we'll just performer DFS and try to find the values

09:00.500 --> 09:06.260
and the values and the deep values and whatever we want to see in the next part.

09:06.260 --> 09:06.650
Everyone.
