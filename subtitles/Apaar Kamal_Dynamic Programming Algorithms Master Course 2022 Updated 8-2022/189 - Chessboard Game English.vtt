WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:00.900
Right.

00:01.050 --> 00:03.690
So let's discuss the next problem, a chessboard game.

00:04.230 --> 00:07.000
Two players are playing a game on a 15 gross 15 chess board.

00:07.560 --> 00:11.460
A game starts with a single coin located some x comb over coordinate.

00:11.940 --> 00:16.680
Coordinate of the opposite are one comma, one, and the lower right cell out 15, going 15.

00:17.280 --> 00:23.190
Then each move play again would move the coin from six Gomorrah over to these four locations.

00:23.190 --> 00:23.460
Right.

00:23.460 --> 00:28.620
So the coin must remain inside the board, of course, beginning with player one, the player, then

00:28.620 --> 00:29.160
it turns.

00:29.470 --> 00:32.400
The first player is anywhere to make a move, loses the game.

00:34.050 --> 00:37.750
We go below shows all possible moves using our aid cross aid board.

00:40.860 --> 00:41.250
Okay.

00:41.640 --> 00:42.960
Not not a big problem.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.720
Again, initial conditions.

00:44.730 --> 00:45.020
Yeah.

00:45.210 --> 00:50.220
So is again, it's a very similar problem to the previous problem that we are one game of stones you.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.940
So in those types of problems actually those are.

00:55.790 --> 00:56.890
Wendy problems, right?

00:57.200 --> 01:02.300
Those are problems in which we were going minus two to the left on minus three or minus four.

01:02.690 --> 01:04.160
So this is a 2D problem.

01:04.160 --> 01:08.360
Instead of X direction, we have vitality and also there can be 3D problems too, right?

01:08.840 --> 01:10.700
What is the best way to solve all these problems?

01:11.000 --> 01:11.650
Just one to go.

01:11.660 --> 01:12.350
The relation.

01:13.150 --> 01:13.480
Okay.

01:13.490 --> 01:14.240
So this is that.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.140
It goes in relation.

01:17.620 --> 01:18.940
That will solve all the problems.

01:20.050 --> 01:23.710
It will go to all the locations we will simply dig.

01:23.710 --> 01:26.190
And of all those states, wherever I can go.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.280
And then I will not.

01:28.560 --> 01:28.860
Hey.

01:30.220 --> 01:30.550
Okay.

01:30.610 --> 01:31.030
So.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.020
I hope this is clear.

01:33.110 --> 01:34.790
So it's an art of our need study now.

01:35.010 --> 01:36.030
Hey, let's go.

01:36.050 --> 01:37.370
This guy is not adopting.

01:37.670 --> 01:38.070
I, uh.

01:38.480 --> 01:41.420
I would always suggest you try it yourself first.

01:42.140 --> 01:42.360
Right.

01:42.440 --> 01:42.830
So.

01:44.170 --> 01:44.360
Good.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.540
So let's take.

01:47.670 --> 01:48.030
Be.

01:50.690 --> 01:52.700
And my T minus minus.

01:53.420 --> 01:59.570
So we have to ask Syria and it needs to ask is we are getting two integers, X and Y, right?

01:59.930 --> 02:01.510
So what else is if?

02:02.210 --> 02:04.370
Okay, let's write a function called give state.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.790
Which will tell me where there's a winning or losing position.

02:08.790 --> 02:15.570
So it will take X and y rate to give straight, will take x and y and it will tell me whether the x

02:15.570 --> 02:18.020
column of the location is a winning or losing position.

02:19.050 --> 02:21.470
So give state and it spots X coming rightward.

02:22.640 --> 02:28.490
If give state is not if it is something that means not zero will simply print first rate.

02:28.490 --> 02:30.500
So I guess here we should be in first only.

02:30.710 --> 02:31.340
Yeah, first.

02:32.260 --> 02:33.790
Else we'll see out.

02:35.130 --> 02:35.550
Thinking.

02:36.710 --> 02:38.690
Hey, now, guys, let's go do this.

02:38.690 --> 02:40.370
Give stage function to it.

02:40.370 --> 02:41.970
Should we do it right?

02:41.970 --> 02:42.340
Bullion.

02:42.410 --> 02:43.070
No problem.

02:43.940 --> 02:44.180
Hey.

02:45.310 --> 02:45.800
Uh.

02:46.030 --> 02:46.330
Yeah.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.610
So let's take some bullion answer.

02:48.610 --> 02:50.350
And in Italy, win market rate.

02:50.980 --> 02:52.550
So that's what we are doing in Italian market.

02:52.550 --> 02:52.810
True.

02:52.810 --> 02:55.950
And then we will take and with the other states they.

02:55.990 --> 02:57.100
So I say give state.

02:58.030 --> 02:59.450
Of which really?

03:00.100 --> 03:02.320
The first one is X minus two, Y plus one.

03:04.030 --> 03:05.200
X minus two.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.220
Y plus one.

03:12.160 --> 03:12.470
Right.

03:12.610 --> 03:15.820
So the second one is X minus two, Y minus one.

03:16.180 --> 03:18.400
The third one is the explosive one by minus two.

03:19.090 --> 03:21.640
X plus one, Y minus.

03:23.310 --> 03:23.610
Ooh.

03:24.450 --> 03:26.350
And the fourth one is X minus one moment, Minister.

03:27.390 --> 03:29.670
So X minus one and y minus.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.370
To find.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.760
And finally, the answer will be north of Answer.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.010
Yeah, that's what we discussed.

03:39.760 --> 03:40.540
Answer the question.

03:40.540 --> 03:41.290
Not of answer.

03:43.250 --> 03:44.780
And I lived in that city.

03:45.050 --> 03:51.620
And this guy there in memoirs did so late, submitted funds and it's sick whether memorization is needed

03:51.620 --> 03:52.070
or not.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.130
Okay.

03:55.130 --> 03:57.260
Let's build this first, then only bill summit.

03:58.540 --> 03:59.190
Mm hmm.

03:59.770 --> 04:01.180
Yeah, there is some issue.

04:02.230 --> 04:02.900
Oh, yeah.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.480
We skipped the main part of recording.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.260
That is a base case.

04:05.860 --> 04:07.000
What was the base case?

04:07.360 --> 04:09.610
If Exxon Mobile is out of my board.

04:10.090 --> 04:10.300
Okay.

04:10.690 --> 04:16.840
So if exit less than one or excuse me, greater than 15 or VI is less than one or VI is greater than

04:17.170 --> 04:17.560
15.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.720
That means we're out of.

04:22.010 --> 04:26.330
So if you are out of the board of our Twitter, then we should have done something that should not affect

04:26.330 --> 04:30.410
other students as they should read it and drool of all the guys.

04:32.270 --> 04:32.960
Think about this.

04:33.830 --> 04:34.460
I'm digging.

04:34.460 --> 04:36.170
And from all over the states, I.

04:37.470 --> 04:43.770
Well, if let's say this state was out of bone for some x come away X minus doing very pleasant is out

04:43.770 --> 04:48.150
of bone, but the outer bone states should not affect my answer.

04:49.370 --> 04:53.930
So what will not affect my end if I dig through right?

04:53.940 --> 04:54.710
If I do it in one?

04:57.380 --> 04:57.680
Eight.

04:58.940 --> 05:03.200
Hold off singing first verse and let's see.

05:06.410 --> 05:09.800
Okay let me summited without and commanding this first.

05:11.220 --> 05:12.250
Mm.

05:13.020 --> 05:13.320
Yeah.

05:13.470 --> 05:13.830
Zero.

05:13.830 --> 05:14.220
Wrong.

05:14.250 --> 05:14.880
Wrong answer.

05:14.910 --> 05:19.500
Because I haven't encountered this, so I need to commend it and then will submit it again.

05:23.230 --> 05:27.060
Well, now what we are getting is we are getting timely take Syria Iran desk is one.

05:27.070 --> 05:31.420
So this is because in each desk is the whole because of treaties being formed.

05:31.420 --> 05:31.720
Right.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.970
So just to avoid this, how do we do it, guys?

05:34.870 --> 05:40.150
If I avoid if I have to avoid the Holy Ghost every and I want I don't want do it duplicated.

05:41.750 --> 05:42.620
Calculations.

05:42.740 --> 05:44.570
So I use memorization rate.

05:46.170 --> 05:47.400
So let's memorize it.

05:47.580 --> 05:48.920
So I'm taking a map.

05:48.930 --> 05:50.070
You can even take an area.

05:51.000 --> 05:51.810
No problem with that.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.740
Initialize an area with minus one and all that easy thing.

05:55.050 --> 06:00.120
So if you're not familiar with memorization, then you can watch the dynamic programming course, right?

06:01.770 --> 06:03.000
Everything would be mentioned there.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.030
So memorization is just two stored things so it doesn't count digging paints and billiard found.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.880
So if map contains x going away, I simply.

06:12.870 --> 06:13.770
Written MP.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.100
X comma by weight.

06:17.530 --> 06:25.210
And finally what we'll do is map off my bicycle transit pilot any as will simply save any of them.

06:25.330 --> 06:26.740
So basically this should be boolean.

06:27.960 --> 06:28.260
I need.

06:29.390 --> 06:29.750
Now let's.

06:29.750 --> 06:30.260
Sigurd.

06:31.200 --> 06:31.470
Yeah.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.960
It's well, it's submitted once.

06:40.390 --> 06:40.720
Cool.

06:40.720 --> 06:46.330
So other desk is his boss case and soon the next part is good.

06:47.020 --> 06:47.380
Okay.
