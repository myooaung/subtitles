WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.540
So we saw the British approach and understood that it wouldn't work.

00:05.090 --> 00:10.600
Now let's understand how to apply the trees and.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.750
So first point that we have noticed is the.

00:19.530 --> 00:22.140
Root of the tree doesn't matter.

00:23.400 --> 00:27.960
Whichever node is the root of the tree beginning again in order to be the root of the tree, the answer

00:27.960 --> 00:29.280
would be the same, right?

00:29.690 --> 00:34.150
The root of the tree doesn't matter because this structure isn't.

00:35.090 --> 00:40.280
The second thing is of renaming or reordering.

00:41.560 --> 00:42.970
Or remembering.

00:45.460 --> 00:48.040
The numbering doesn't matter, right?

00:48.490 --> 00:52.690
Again, the same reason because the structure of the tree remains the same.

00:53.230 --> 00:53.420
Eight.

00:54.470 --> 00:57.740
Now I need to understand what is important to you.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.240
What does a state offer?

00:59.240 --> 00:59.680
Deep.

01:00.260 --> 01:04.020
When it's applied for, it represents the facility.

01:04.020 --> 01:09.410
We make the same tree that we took for contradicting the greedy approach.

01:11.110 --> 01:11.380
Yeah.

01:11.390 --> 01:12.460
So this was the one, right?

01:12.790 --> 01:17.080
And in this I'm just naming it, naming all the nodes quickly.

01:18.490 --> 01:27.430
Well, I in this variety I'd say DP X or DP or whatever, you can see it or let's say DP current, but

01:27.700 --> 01:29.430
that's what I use an adequate.

01:29.920 --> 01:30.940
What is DP current?

01:30.970 --> 01:34.330
DP current is nothing, but it will store beyond.

01:34.480 --> 01:39.930
I'm not I'm not actually talking about the problem that we're discussing, but in general, I.

01:41.130 --> 01:47.740
The deep current is nothing, but it stores the answer before it gets the answer for.

01:48.960 --> 01:49.950
Thus subtree.

01:53.010 --> 01:53.970
Representing.

01:55.330 --> 01:57.130
Or to the subtree of current.

01:59.570 --> 02:00.290
This is important.

02:00.710 --> 02:01.010
Right.

02:01.100 --> 02:06.530
So first thing that is very confusing here is that they can be very surprised because let's say if I

02:06.530 --> 02:06.980
choose.

02:06.980 --> 02:07.230
Ah.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.720
To do with the.

02:10.450 --> 02:13.120
Let's see if I choose to go to the root of the tree.

02:13.120 --> 02:22.540
Then we'll get I'll get one child five it's and one will have three or and then three will have six

02:22.540 --> 02:23.050
and seven.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.660
So here you can see that both these trees are seen.

02:25.810 --> 02:27.610
They are exactly the same trees.

02:27.880 --> 02:30.360
It's just that I have big to do with the.

02:31.450 --> 02:33.180
A rude note of the rewrite.

02:33.340 --> 02:39.130
The structure of the tree remains the same, and the answer the vertex cover of this tree will also

02:39.130 --> 02:40.780
be the same because the structure is the same.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.300
Will always remember.

02:43.630 --> 02:51.190
It is not specially mentioned in the problem statement that big one has the root of the tree or take

02:51.190 --> 02:54.220
some any other vertex to be root of the tree.

02:54.220 --> 02:54.520
Then.

02:54.970 --> 03:00.580
Then there is only one thing you can take any node as the any vertex as the root of the tree.

03:00.580 --> 03:01.960
And the answers won't change.

03:02.560 --> 03:09.010
But if the problem specifically says that one is the root of the tree and the problem statement will

03:09.010 --> 03:16.360
be according to this rate, because then any state that is depicted in will be according to when one

03:16.360 --> 03:18.220
is the root of the tree.

03:18.220 --> 03:18.490
Right.

03:18.820 --> 03:23.740
So here you can see that this trees will change if the root of my tree will change.

03:23.830 --> 03:24.150
Correct.

03:24.400 --> 03:28.750
It's a subtree is nothing but the whole tree which is under the current node.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.730
Basically this is subtree of two.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.240
This is subtree of a this is subtree of one.

03:34.760 --> 03:35.650
Subtree of root.

03:35.650 --> 03:39.460
Notice the whole 3/8 of subtree of root.

03:40.410 --> 03:40.800
This.

03:41.660 --> 03:42.250
The holding.

03:45.060 --> 03:49.020
So now in this case we can see the subtree of two is the hold rate.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.340
So always remember subtree is will change according to the root.

03:52.350 --> 03:58.860
But the answers won't change if the if the problem statement as mentioned that you can take any note

03:58.860 --> 04:00.050
to be the root of the tree.

04:01.070 --> 04:01.300
Yeah.

04:01.870 --> 04:03.650
Then let's move on and let's.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.300
So we understood that.

04:06.110 --> 04:07.850
Where did deep cut in store?

04:08.060 --> 04:11.570
It will always store the answer for this subtree of the current state.

04:11.990 --> 04:18.440
So if I say dpi of two, that means if this is the tree, that means two and five is the tree.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.340
Then what's the answer?

04:20.030 --> 04:20.380
Correct.

04:20.630 --> 04:24.770
For example, let me give you a quick example.

04:25.190 --> 04:31.820
Let's say a deep current represents I'm just dodging slightly away from the problem.

04:32.190 --> 04:34.850
The current represents the sum.

04:36.490 --> 04:37.090
The sum.

04:38.450 --> 04:39.470
Or let's say.

04:40.660 --> 04:40.950
Okay.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.340
Let's see the some off notes.

04:43.880 --> 04:44.560
In this arbitrary.

04:47.570 --> 04:47.810
Well.

04:48.470 --> 04:52.010
So what is the sum of nodes in this up to your favorite is.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.110
I'm taking these some of note.

04:54.230 --> 04:55.430
It is six and it is seven.

04:55.730 --> 04:56.270
What is this?

04:56.270 --> 04:58.190
Some off note in this subtree of two?

04:58.730 --> 04:59.120
It is.

05:00.240 --> 05:03.060
Who bless whatever is this almost arbitrary of nodes of five.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.960
I can see all I can always say this what any subtree that means.

05:06.960 --> 05:16.020
I can easily say that BP current is nothing but permission of DP X, where x is child of current.

05:17.390 --> 05:23.840
So if I want to find out this almost arbitrary of some particular note cutting and what I can do is

05:23.840 --> 05:26.000
find out this almost arbitrary note of all the.

05:27.180 --> 05:31.890
I love the current and add current on top of a less current.

05:32.850 --> 05:33.900
Right here.

05:33.900 --> 05:34.290
We'll see.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.240
It will be seven here with six plus three.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.080
It's nine here.

05:37.080 --> 05:37.980
It'll be ten plus four.

05:37.980 --> 05:39.150
11 or one.

05:39.150 --> 05:39.700
What it will be.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.780
It will be seven plus nine plus 11.

05:41.780 --> 05:41.950
Right.

05:42.060 --> 05:47.220
So for one word, aliases, finally, these are three of some of two, four, three, four, four.

05:47.660 --> 05:48.120
We know.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.310
What is this upgrade sum of two?

05:50.700 --> 05:51.450
It is seven.

05:51.930 --> 05:53.940
It is nine and it is 11.

05:54.390 --> 05:54.630
Correct.

05:54.870 --> 05:59.670
So if these are these are three, some of two, three and four, then what we disrupted sum of one.

06:00.060 --> 06:04.050
It will be nothing but subtree sum of two, three plus four plus one.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.700
Eight, that is.

06:06.740 --> 06:07.350
Seven nine.

06:07.610 --> 06:08.720
And it will be 20.

06:10.310 --> 06:14.330
So I hope you're able to understand what does a deep state represent?

06:14.600 --> 06:15.590
And that is in general.

06:15.590 --> 06:15.890
Right.

06:16.160 --> 06:20.360
But now let's move back to the problem and and for the problem arises.

06:21.600 --> 06:27.000
I just want to make this thing very clear that always the bickering will represent the answer for the

06:27.000 --> 06:27.870
subtree of current.

06:28.350 --> 06:31.580
So let me related to Wendy to be again, gendered.

06:31.950 --> 06:39.060
But what happens in Wendy to be whenever I talk about I right, I say, what is the answer for the first

06:39.060 --> 06:39.720
three elements.

06:40.470 --> 06:42.010
I elements, right.

06:42.330 --> 06:46.100
Or what I say is it what is the answer for the last element?

06:46.460 --> 06:48.450
As we are talking about suffix a or.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.940
But if I say I.

06:50.960 --> 06:51.870
Last night.

06:51.910 --> 06:53.570
Elements made.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.370
I hope you remember that.

06:56.390 --> 06:58.000
We talk about Eddie from.

06:59.350 --> 07:05.110
But if say which is this and or we talk about a fixed rate.

07:05.920 --> 07:06.180
Yeah.

07:06.190 --> 07:07.780
Which is not this but this.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.830
These things should be very clear right now.

07:11.890 --> 07:17.800
Similarly, I'm just trying to make a relation here that what is deep current represented in a tree?

07:17.880 --> 07:23.410
Maybe it represents the answer for the subtree of it, but we can see there is no prefix or this no

07:23.410 --> 07:23.770
suffix.

07:23.920 --> 07:27.160
But we can always see in these subtree offered world.

07:29.260 --> 07:30.850
I hope this is very clear.

07:31.950 --> 07:35.760
That there will be a subterranean wall whenever I talk about Deep Current.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.970
What will be the final answer for any deputy?

07:39.330 --> 07:41.260
But any new entry is a problem.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.480
What should be the final answer?

07:43.140 --> 07:44.340
Final answer should be nothing.

07:44.340 --> 07:45.990
Might be off route.

07:47.290 --> 07:53.650
I didn't get it because the b of the road will always carry the ends of or the whole subtree of root,

07:53.650 --> 07:55.570
which is nothing but the whole tree.

07:56.140 --> 07:56.440
Right.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.040
Just making some terms and definitions very clear.

08:00.070 --> 08:05.530
And in the next slide, what we'll do is we'll start with the the problem, the vertex cover problem,

08:05.530 --> 08:09.070
and we'll see how to make it states and solve it.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.140
We'll see the next part.
