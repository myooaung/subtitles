00:00.860 --> 00:06.140
And the ruin is most one of the most interesting problems or dynamic programming.

00:06.560 --> 00:09.850
And you can easily see it's one of the most famous problems as well.

00:11.150 --> 00:15.530
It's called regular expression matching outfits, not only about anime programming.

00:15.530 --> 00:17.210
This regular expression matching is.

00:18.700 --> 00:22.130
It is a building function of many languages.

00:23.180 --> 00:25.070
So let's see how to implement it.

00:25.100 --> 00:27.380
And first of all, let's understand the problem.

00:27.950 --> 00:32.810
It is a very similar to wild card pattern matching problem, but.

00:33.780 --> 00:34.710
There's a twist in this.

00:35.770 --> 00:41.490
It says that giving in and boosting SNP employment, regular expression matching with support of START

00:41.970 --> 00:52.040
and START, will invite carbon emitting adverse ocean mark and star aid in deserted gardens to the darting

00:52.050 --> 00:52.290
ocean.

00:52.290 --> 00:56.190
MAGA kind of same day matches any single character seen by pattern matching.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.410
Also, it was a question magnitude.

00:58.410 --> 01:01.260
Anything is connected to that kind of the same thing.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.720
Or the second point is very different.

01:04.020 --> 01:07.770
It says the star matches zero or more of the preceding element.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.120
This is tricky mate.

01:09.690 --> 01:12.030
So inviting pattern matching also.

01:13.010 --> 01:16.220
We saw that the staff had managed continuous characters.

01:16.970 --> 01:24.140
But here it is that it does not match any going continuous characters.

01:24.170 --> 01:25.070
It matches.

01:26.790 --> 01:28.650
Zero or more preceding element.

01:28.650 --> 01:32.180
What is preceding element in this preceding element for this applicant?

01:32.190 --> 01:37.470
Various examples I will discuss these examples as well, or just understand this preceding element is

01:37.950 --> 01:43.110
the element which is this preceding this dot in the pattern.

01:43.110 --> 01:47.940
It's not about as it is about the pattern, only a book.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.760
For example, it seeks an example and stands doubly.

01:52.080 --> 01:56.850
These will never match and I believe and start right here.

01:56.850 --> 02:03.990
It means this star can match any number of these is even zero of disease is so here we can see started

02:03.990 --> 02:06.060
matching two of these is eight.

02:06.630 --> 02:14.940
In this example it says star can match any of these, but any TV star is able to match any of these

02:14.940 --> 02:15.300
dots.

02:15.720 --> 02:22.350
That means by start will match with it and the second part will match with B, so you can take any number

02:22.350 --> 02:22.710
of dots.

02:23.580 --> 02:29.970
So basically dot star can match with anything in this wildcard in this.

02:30.960 --> 02:31.620
Regular expression.

02:32.580 --> 02:34.120
Well, I reckon some good example.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.170
Let's see them.

02:35.190 --> 02:39.030
So to get more clarity on this, this is the first example.

02:39.030 --> 02:45.480
It is a, b is fingers and b c da is da b.

02:46.460 --> 02:51.510
Now what, according to you should be the regular expression matching over here.

02:51.530 --> 02:52.760
Should it be true or false?

02:52.790 --> 02:55.010
Means will they match or would they not?

02:56.370 --> 02:57.640
Level eight.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.850
Because here.

03:01.230 --> 03:03.390
DOD is matching Xeroxes.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.300
It can also match zero characters of DC.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.570
Basically this kind of consuming C and taking it away.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.490
It means they both vanished.

03:12.450 --> 03:14.660
So just let's get back to the problem.

03:14.670 --> 03:16.950
It says zero or more of the preceding element.

03:17.550 --> 03:18.570
The results are important.

03:19.110 --> 03:20.610
They just vanished.

03:20.700 --> 03:27.720
This emerged with DC and now we know that this started in any number of ways because age is pretty superseding

03:27.720 --> 03:28.170
the start.

03:28.660 --> 03:29.160
So here.

03:30.100 --> 03:30.580
Again.

03:30.580 --> 03:31.960
This started in March with the.

03:33.140 --> 03:35.420
Or instead, let's let me make this zero.

03:36.170 --> 03:41.180
This is also matching this here because dot again match any number of years now and this may be matches

03:41.180 --> 03:44.120
with basically this your return group.

03:44.900 --> 03:48.080
So this is important you see that how does see vanish.

03:49.070 --> 03:49.400
Eight.

03:50.450 --> 03:52.940
There is no matching Fauci part of this stuff.

03:53.510 --> 03:55.100
Let's talk about this second example.

03:55.100 --> 03:57.770
It is e e b start again.

03:57.770 --> 03:58.310
The same thing.

03:58.520 --> 04:06.710
It will return true because now there will be zero matching of this B to B and this star matches with

04:06.710 --> 04:09.650
empty string various images with.

04:09.890 --> 04:12.560
So therefore these are regular expression matching.

04:13.070 --> 04:14.300
Well, this is a third example.

04:14.900 --> 04:15.590
So e.

04:19.900 --> 04:20.230
Okay.

04:20.260 --> 04:20.740
Let me.

04:21.960 --> 04:23.340
Let me also think about it.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.200
Firstly, what's happening?

04:26.320 --> 04:29.470
But of course, we don't need this piece of this has to go.

04:30.260 --> 04:32.260
And we made it this way.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.280
We don't need to see it.

04:34.430 --> 04:36.890
So therefore, this matches with this.

04:37.670 --> 04:39.050
This matches with this.

04:39.350 --> 04:40.790
And this matches.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.180
But d e I we're getting this right.

04:46.390 --> 04:51.790
So here b started on c started going only is starting is left which matches with three is.

04:52.890 --> 04:58.890
Well, these are some different ratings examples on which, let's say I recorded, but before that I

04:58.890 --> 05:03.900
want you to go to this problem and think about it and you can try all these different examples.

05:04.050 --> 05:08.370
What is the what is the answer that you are getting?

05:08.370 --> 05:11.850
Because it might be thinking these cases are tricky, right?

05:12.210 --> 05:13.050
What about this case?

05:13.110 --> 05:14.070
Case, the fourth one?

05:14.980 --> 05:15.730
I'm here.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.580
This this dark skinned match with the.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.760
And what about these two dots?

05:22.830 --> 05:24.090
They would not match anyway.

05:24.570 --> 05:25.440
And this can match.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.360
This could have automated with it.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.780
But again, it can be a second thing, right?

05:31.850 --> 05:34.140
Look, let's go back and do it again.

05:34.440 --> 05:34.740
It should.

05:34.740 --> 05:35.550
This vanishes.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.290
This vanishes.

05:37.380 --> 05:41.550
There's only two notes remaining, but there's only one eight.

05:41.940 --> 05:42.370
But if.

05:42.470 --> 05:46.290
If it would have been and B, then it would have returned as true.

05:46.290 --> 05:52.140
Because this image is with this B matches with this this image with zero characters and this dark matches

05:52.140 --> 05:52.830
with zero characters.

05:52.830 --> 05:53.520
Because it is.

05:54.460 --> 06:01.930
Dorothy, one thing to note here is if there's a character, let's say the character, and there's a

06:01.930 --> 06:02.890
start after it.

06:04.030 --> 06:12.430
Wherever the action is taken on this character, it is decided at this place not it is decided because

06:12.700 --> 06:17.620
there's a start up in it whether this character will come into the pattern matching or not.

06:17.980 --> 06:20.350
The second is how many times will it come into Britain?

06:20.980 --> 06:21.820
It is decided.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.510
Because they started it.

06:25.660 --> 06:25.980
Eight.

06:26.990 --> 06:29.180
This is an important observation that we should make.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.310
Well, and.

06:33.410 --> 06:36.540
Now the next is ABC and is this.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.030
So here we can.

06:39.290 --> 06:39.680
Okay.

06:40.810 --> 06:48.250
This vanishes because we don't need the C, C, B, and this will match with the one one character of

06:48.250 --> 06:48.810
the start button.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.980
Nate, I hope you're getting this.

06:51.980 --> 06:53.830
And it is kind of very tricky.

06:53.840 --> 06:59.420
If you if you'd just pause the video and go to court and, you know, solve this problem yourself,

06:59.720 --> 07:01.400
you will see that it's very, very tricky.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.800
And it requires.

07:05.150 --> 07:07.820
It requires just one validation.

07:07.820 --> 07:10.940
The validation is very simple for any character.

07:11.420 --> 07:16.220
If there's a start after it, we need to decide what actions should be taken on that character.

07:16.580 --> 07:18.770
Right now, moving on to Star.

07:19.880 --> 07:21.860
So let's see what I mean from day.

07:23.630 --> 07:26.480
Who could I hope to see in the examples?

07:27.110 --> 07:30.110
What we'll do is I'll start with the solution here and.

07:32.790 --> 07:32.990
Right.

07:33.220 --> 07:33.820
So firstly.

07:34.830 --> 07:35.400
The same thing.

07:35.760 --> 07:44.340
So let's say I was doing A, B, C and I have this thing second string, which is a pattern either Jay-Z.

07:44.460 --> 07:45.990
Let's make some cases like what?

07:46.230 --> 07:47.520
All cases are possible.

07:48.060 --> 07:55.050
The first major case that I can see is that if Jay's a character and after it, I have a start.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.070
Right.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.390
This is the character.

07:58.170 --> 07:59.000
Any character, right.

07:59.010 --> 08:02.490
It can be dotted, can be a and after it I will start.

08:02.700 --> 08:06.450
That means Jay plus one is Scott for this case.

08:06.450 --> 08:09.180
And this case should be handled earlier.

08:09.780 --> 08:10.320
Basically.

08:11.370 --> 08:11.880
Liquidate.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.380
This is one.

08:14.940 --> 08:16.500
So what is case one?

08:18.030 --> 08:18.450
If.

08:19.880 --> 08:23.720
The plus one and the tip of the plus one is equal to.

08:26.610 --> 08:32.730
If B of d plus one is equals to start and right knowing one I comedy and the next character is start

08:33.360 --> 08:39.240
will not tell me in how many B's and this next character be matched with the eighth character.

08:40.370 --> 08:44.090
So we all know that we are trying to match some eye with some juice.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.170
But I learned to.

08:46.250 --> 08:49.340
And that's all that has always been my deep state.

08:49.580 --> 08:52.190
Whenever I'm solving integrative problems.

08:53.720 --> 08:53.950
So.

08:54.940 --> 08:55.300
Now.

08:55.420 --> 08:56.290
Nothing about this.

08:57.290 --> 09:00.080
Uh, let's see if I have a character.

09:00.380 --> 09:03.710
Okay, so let's say this character is e in the eighth position.

09:04.100 --> 09:04.970
In digit position.

09:04.970 --> 09:05.780
I have a daughter.

09:06.650 --> 09:09.080
And I will start late.

09:09.260 --> 09:13.550
So if I have a dart here, will this match with the dart?

09:13.910 --> 09:14.810
Yes, because.

09:15.720 --> 09:18.330
I would start start again, do two things, right.

09:18.540 --> 09:23.950
It can match the characters or it can match one character and repeat the same story.

09:23.970 --> 09:26.970
That means match one character in the next itself.

09:27.810 --> 09:28.350
Let's see.

09:29.130 --> 09:30.990
Let's I'm just talking about the first kiss here now.

09:32.170 --> 09:33.720
Let's see if I.

09:34.660 --> 09:37.480
Is equal to this easy.

09:39.010 --> 09:41.830
Eight essays equal stupider than what should happen.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.350
And we say they're deep.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.310
I got major.

09:46.380 --> 09:49.980
Can be equal to a p.

09:51.470 --> 09:54.500
That means see if essays matching PJ eight.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.190
That means.

09:56.220 --> 10:01.500
The Iot character has merged with the Git character and now I'm seeing Gomez.

10:01.530 --> 10:02.370
I bless one.

10:03.490 --> 10:04.500
It will match.

10:04.510 --> 10:07.440
I press one with whatever you want to match.

10:07.450 --> 10:10.690
And now match this.

10:12.340 --> 10:12.730
G.

10:12.910 --> 10:13.210
Right.

10:13.390 --> 10:16.480
So this G will not move forward because it has a start up.

10:17.260 --> 10:17.920
This is important.

10:18.760 --> 10:23.520
It means if a character is matched, I can match any number of characters after the date.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.140
So what I'll do is just.

10:25.270 --> 10:26.770
Just give me a second.

10:27.310 --> 10:28.780
I quickly write this case.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.300
And explain it.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.300
Execute as many as eight.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.730
And I'm trying to match this with this.

10:41.010 --> 10:48.180
So tell me if this ear matches with this Jay, because right now Jay has a dart.

10:48.510 --> 10:49.890
I mean, it will be the same kids.

10:49.890 --> 10:52.980
But let me just say, Avery, you know what?

10:52.980 --> 10:55.860
I know we can see as Isaiah goes to PJ and PJ plus one.

10:55.860 --> 10:57.270
Is that right?

10:57.300 --> 10:59.110
That means this E can match with the current.

10:59.160 --> 11:05.790
I mean, I will simply say I bless when that means when this current is matched and I start matching

11:05.790 --> 11:09.960
from my plus one or should I increase D?

11:10.320 --> 11:11.100
That's my question.

11:12.420 --> 11:14.670
Should I see that match, this match?

11:14.880 --> 11:15.860
It doesn't make sense, right?

11:15.880 --> 11:19.170
Because we can never imagine individual star character.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.360
We can never imagine individual star character.

11:21.360 --> 11:21.990
We all know that.

11:23.010 --> 11:24.030
Eight five can right.

11:24.060 --> 11:26.550
Never imagine to be a songwriter because God.

11:28.260 --> 11:34.050
Story is based on the preceding element to the is based on the preceding element and we can never meet

11:34.050 --> 11:36.420
him, match it individually.

11:37.140 --> 11:40.440
So moving one step doesn't make sense at all.

11:41.190 --> 11:42.660
Firstly and secondly.

11:43.990 --> 11:46.850
More of these is can also be merged with this.

11:46.900 --> 11:50.000
Hey, let's I will not increment you.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.430
I will say cool this image with this here.

11:53.500 --> 11:57.430
Now again, match the rest of this string, which is from my plus one.

11:58.430 --> 12:01.520
With this only because this again, again, be repeated.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.190
This is what tells us that.

12:05.180 --> 12:10.640
Star can match any number of days by not moving this particular g value ahead.

12:10.670 --> 12:11.970
You're not moving this point ahead.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.440
You're saying, okay, again, match this with other, is it?

12:15.590 --> 12:17.330
So in the next step, what will happen again?

12:17.330 --> 12:19.740
Be equal, equal to star.

12:20.030 --> 12:25.160
And if so, that means in that case s I will be equal to the next character, which is this A-plus one

12:25.940 --> 12:28.190
in the in the next state, in this state.

12:28.940 --> 12:31.400
And then again, it will be equal to in it will match.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.230
And again, only I will move forward.

12:33.800 --> 12:33.990
Okay.

12:34.010 --> 12:40.060
So I hope you are seeing that how multiple eyes are being merged when there's a star up to 88.

12:40.580 --> 12:41.870
What can be the second case?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.260
The second case can be.

12:45.660 --> 12:52.260
If B it's inside casement only rate if BD is equal to DART.

12:53.450 --> 12:58.550
Always tell me if bees is equals to diet, that means our diet can match any number of characters.

12:59.540 --> 13:00.680
A letter to the daughter.

13:01.370 --> 13:02.560
It can also match DC.

13:03.790 --> 13:05.650
So won't it be the same case?

13:07.570 --> 13:13.570
It means I'm matching some eyes with Jade and it will be called simple DP I plus one Comanche.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.030
I mean, both of them are the same cases.

13:16.450 --> 13:19.720
If it has the same character, then also perform the same thing.

13:20.230 --> 13:26.380
If it has a dart, so dart can match any number of it, not can match any single character.

13:27.370 --> 13:33.880
If Dhadkan match any single character, I will say okay, move ahead and match it with this current.

13:35.230 --> 13:40.240
But basically what will happen this guard will match with the, let's say the dark matches with the

13:40.870 --> 13:45.310
now we know if I start is behind the door, that means any number of darts can match.

13:46.270 --> 13:48.160
So if any number of their darts can match.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.760
That's why they will be the same repeating statement.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.970
That means I will move forward and then again it can match with the start.

13:54.970 --> 13:58.960
Again, it can match with the dart, even if let's make a case.

14:00.090 --> 14:03.160
Let's make this case, let's say is B, C, D, eight.

14:03.580 --> 14:06.960
But if it would have been a start, then only this aide would have mentioned this.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.610
We would not have missed it.

14:08.820 --> 14:10.860
Or what if it is a dart stop?

14:11.340 --> 14:13.350
If it is a dart start, this aid will match this.

14:13.350 --> 14:18.690
We will also match the C will also match and this D will also meet because we know that can match any

14:18.690 --> 14:19.470
single character.

14:19.470 --> 14:23.790
And this star is repeating this dart to match many single characters.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.400
I hope this is clear.

14:26.940 --> 14:29.250
The first two cases right now.

14:29.250 --> 14:31.010
Let's make the next case.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.190
What can be the second case?

14:33.690 --> 14:35.070
Just as that means.

14:35.070 --> 14:40.680
If PGA PGA players, when it's an article to start with, the next character is not a star, then let's

14:40.680 --> 14:42.450
worry about what is the current character.

14:45.420 --> 14:49.860
Okay, so there's one more thing that here we are we have missed.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.180
And it is.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.160
I hope you remember the first example.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.730
The first example is that the next character is a star.

14:58.210 --> 15:00.250
But we don't want to match it.

15:00.610 --> 15:06.610
This case, it seems to be I don't see Nick's character is a star, but we don't want to match this

15:06.610 --> 15:07.990
with any of the characters above.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.840
We simply want that star doesn't match any of the greatest images.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.410
Zero character logos.

15:14.440 --> 15:17.080
In this case, that was matching one character.

15:17.660 --> 15:19.150
Eight liquidator.

15:22.260 --> 15:22.530
Yeah.

15:23.620 --> 15:24.250
In this kid.

15:24.700 --> 15:32.860
Steinmetz is one character because they are equal here also starred images one character and of course

15:32.860 --> 15:33.850
allows you to repeat.

15:34.780 --> 15:36.790
And now let's make a third case.

15:37.120 --> 15:37.840
Hard cases.

15:38.630 --> 15:40.540
It's got images, zero characters.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.870
That means I don't want start to match any of the characters now.

15:44.470 --> 15:47.530
If I don't want start to match any of the characters now, that means.

15:48.790 --> 15:51.130
I'm on digital director, I want it to vanish.

15:51.610 --> 15:55.850
And that means I want the current character to vanish and the start to also go.

15:55.870 --> 15:58.150
It means let me write this.

15:58.150 --> 16:00.970
Let's say we see next year to see Star ABC.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.180
Well, that means I want these to go away.

16:05.710 --> 16:05.970
So.

16:07.690 --> 16:19.630
If I'm matching AI with D, I will simply say match i.e. with the plus eight match I with duplex do.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.160
Now that means simply remove this.

16:22.180 --> 16:25.130
It means now START is matching the zero character.

16:25.150 --> 16:34.180
This is also a case raid zero character and it is always possible that pop icon Magi can alter depending

16:34.180 --> 16:34.540
upon.

16:36.050 --> 16:44.750
BP I because see if it is not any indicator I will not increase it and do will increase by you by will

16:44.750 --> 16:46.070
the increase by two because.

16:47.310 --> 16:51.090
It is matching zero character and star and Seattle vanishing.

16:51.180 --> 16:54.840
I just think your key from this is start matching with this if.

16:55.790 --> 16:58.580
Well, this is a case that is very important.

16:58.580 --> 17:01.220
That's why I took the first example as this case only.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.430
It is, it can match zero characters as well.

17:06.090 --> 17:09.060
Well so I think these Rodriguez's for the start.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.680
Now let's talk about.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.660
Excuse me.

17:13.850 --> 17:18.600
So if the next idiot is not a star, if next year it is not a star.

17:19.010 --> 17:23.660
Let's just assume that next character is not a star and current character can be our dot.

17:24.350 --> 17:25.520
Okay, let me write the case.

17:25.640 --> 17:26.030
If.

17:26.030 --> 17:26.750
If PD.

17:27.810 --> 17:29.400
Is equal to a dirt.

17:30.830 --> 17:32.570
And of course the next edit is in our desktop.

17:32.570 --> 17:38.420
So just remove that into the if necessary in order to start in the current correct is a dot letter dot

17:38.420 --> 17:46.640
and it's right e and if I'm, let's say above this B eight in this case, I hear you here.

17:48.090 --> 17:48.740
I met.

17:48.740 --> 17:50.120
I'm trying to match everyday.

17:50.420 --> 17:54.380
What will happen is this dodge should match of it exactly one be.

17:55.310 --> 17:55.700
Oh, sorry.

17:55.700 --> 18:00.350
This guard should match exactly with Vandy because after this round we don't have a star.

18:00.800 --> 18:01.280
Exactly.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.370
One is important here.

18:02.390 --> 18:05.780
It's not, you know, again and again matching in the case over here.

18:06.530 --> 18:09.230
I want it to match the exactly one element and how we led.

18:09.230 --> 18:09.600
I did.

18:10.020 --> 18:13.700
I'll simply say that BPI committee is equal to DP.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.330
I.e. plus one because.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.420
The current director matched.

18:18.440 --> 18:25.010
So just start matching from the next character and the plus one because this part meshed exactly with

18:25.010 --> 18:27.680
one character now can not be matched with any other character.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.700
Just move ahead.

18:29.680 --> 18:29.950
Well.

18:30.820 --> 18:32.950
And now let's make this a good case.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.560
The second cases, if is equal to.

18:37.860 --> 18:39.180
Any character, let's say.

18:43.870 --> 18:44.620
I see it.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.580
So just tell me if that if this.

18:48.970 --> 18:51.850
Okay, let's make cookies is separate in this.

18:51.850 --> 18:53.290
Is that Catholic?

18:53.290 --> 18:56.290
What do I say that means if Prejean says same.

18:57.200 --> 18:57.420
Eight.

18:59.310 --> 19:00.490
Make the case.

19:00.510 --> 19:07.350
Let's say it's A, B, C and E, D, B, so here we can see I enjoy C and it is very simple.

19:07.350 --> 19:11.910
The deep idea will be again, same thing EPA plus one plus one.

19:11.910 --> 19:16.910
That means I enjoy unmatched move ahead and for the third case if easy.

19:18.770 --> 19:20.780
Is a character and it is not equal to.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.990
It is not equal to essay.

19:26.350 --> 19:30.850
If it is not equal to essay and it is not a dart, it is not a star, it is a character board.

19:30.850 --> 19:31.840
The characters don't match.

19:32.140 --> 19:33.220
Then we don't do anything.

19:33.910 --> 19:35.470
We just get involved in this.

19:35.860 --> 19:36.940
But they are not matching.

19:36.940 --> 19:39.460
They will never match because it can't be met.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.110
This is a simple example.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.260
This is not equal to this.

19:43.290 --> 19:44.130
They will not match.

19:44.190 --> 19:45.060
They will never match.

19:45.090 --> 19:45.600
Because.

19:46.780 --> 19:47.740
There's no state or.

19:48.720 --> 19:49.830
Got it.

19:50.280 --> 19:51.480
So we will just.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.430
Let's just remove this case or it's not the case.

19:54.450 --> 19:56.700
Let's do nothing in this case if it involves.

19:59.480 --> 19:59.780
Right.

20:02.260 --> 20:06.740
These were the cases of bodyguard Peyton Manning.

20:06.820 --> 20:12.440
And in the next problem, what we'll do is in the next tutorial, we will escort this in just by six

20:12.440 --> 20:12.950
lines of code.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.830
Not much, because you can see the cases are very loose.

20:16.940 --> 20:17.900
So you just have to.

20:18.860 --> 20:22.940
It was just they were just one getting this that I personally faced.

20:23.300 --> 20:30.860
And it was instead of making g means I have never handled this case when praise equals to start.

20:31.370 --> 20:33.650
Because it will never be equal just because.

20:36.470 --> 20:37.310
That's what it is.

20:37.310 --> 20:39.050
Only when there's a preceding element.

20:39.350 --> 20:43.730
If there's a preceding element and the action is being taken on the preceding element, invite your

20:43.730 --> 20:44.480
ego to start.

20:45.080 --> 20:50.420
I will take the action on the preceding element only by asking whether the next character is.

20:50.780 --> 20:51.590
I started not.

20:54.030 --> 20:54.270
So.

20:54.270 --> 20:55.780
Yeah, put it in the next part.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.280
Thank you.
