00:00.950 --> 00:03.170
Everyone, welcome back.

00:03.410 --> 00:10.190
And now we will solve a very interesting problem from cold forces formalism.

00:10.840 --> 00:15.770
So as now, we have ignored some basics of deep in basics of substance and problem.

00:16.460 --> 00:17.120
I want.

00:18.100 --> 00:23.590
You do focus on the model of some problem and it's a very, very interesting problem.

00:23.590 --> 00:30.610
Said this is good for Cicerone 319 Division two and it's a big problem order to be a problem.

00:30.610 --> 00:31.300
It should be easy.

00:31.300 --> 00:40.060
But I think that this problem should be targeted because it tells us a lot about model laws and mathematics

00:40.060 --> 00:46.780
and dynamic programming and it's all combined in this LHC problem statement is very simple, which is

00:47.020 --> 00:53.470
you are given a sequence of numbers even to A N and E and a number in one.

00:53.650 --> 00:55.060
So we have two things here.

00:56.470 --> 01:05.080
So check if it is possible to choose a non m d sub sequence e.g. such that the sum of this seat is subsequent

01:05.080 --> 01:07.450
is divisible by impolite.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.670
This is actually so absurd.

01:09.670 --> 01:14.320
Some problem with one extra thing that this absurd sum should be divisible by.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.210
M eight.

01:16.680 --> 01:20.400
So let's see the constraint, because those are very important to you.

01:21.030 --> 01:26.080
In every community program, problem constraints are the thing, right?

01:26.100 --> 01:31.740
So we need to think this solution on the basis of constraints because, you know, when when we are

01:31.740 --> 01:33.540
doing this reprogramming thing, then.

01:35.670 --> 01:40.080
We always know the brute force, but that would never be accepted.

01:40.080 --> 01:40.560
NCP.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.620
Then we come to a more optimal solution.

01:43.620 --> 01:46.110
Then we come to furthermore optimise solutions.

01:46.530 --> 01:50.250
We want to come up with a solution with according to the constraints.

01:51.030 --> 01:54.150
So let's say we became on to like three solutions.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.780
So two out of those three solutions might be good solutions.

01:58.050 --> 02:00.180
But what if they are not according to the questions?

02:00.180 --> 02:05.030
So they will never esper my time limit or per my memory limit it.

02:05.050 --> 02:07.320
We need to think on the basis of the constraints.

02:08.950 --> 02:14.940
So we have an in him and in the lens of that name is an number and then they strip our six and go still

02:15.040 --> 02:16.360
and to about three only.

02:17.290 --> 02:20.140
The second line contains and indeed this great.

02:21.550 --> 02:23.770
What we have is we have three, five, one, two, three.

02:24.520 --> 02:30.760
And it will give me years because if I take the sum of all three, then it is due to the way I react

02:31.300 --> 02:34.390
and add one and six.

02:34.390 --> 02:37.240
That means only five and five is not diesel by six.

02:37.240 --> 02:37.720
We know that.

02:38.350 --> 02:43.990
So another example input is four and six before these four numbers I have.

02:45.960 --> 02:51.120
We can see that this three one is diesel by four, this is diesel by four or all of them combined a

02:51.120 --> 02:52.920
diesel by Ford or these three.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.560
And this one is diesel by four.

02:55.590 --> 02:55.900
Right.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.210
So good.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.570
Now, what we have is we have six, six and.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.910
We have five sixes.

03:04.780 --> 03:06.220
We have six face paint.

03:06.220 --> 03:13.690
And so we can see see we take some of all of them combined it will be six, but it goes up for now.

03:13.690 --> 03:19.300
Let's just ignore this the constraints and let's just think of this solution based on the problem.

03:19.450 --> 03:23.050
But it is subset sum only with just one additional concern, which is.

03:24.020 --> 03:27.030
It should reduce the sum should reduce L by eight.

03:27.390 --> 03:33.580
So let me open this quickly and let me talk about the first example, because it is in faith.

03:37.080 --> 03:37.280
Okay.

03:37.470 --> 03:37.860
So.

03:37.860 --> 03:40.710
So you remember we have this table in which.

03:46.930 --> 03:47.800
We have the stable.

03:52.780 --> 03:53.650
In which.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.950
Let's take this to the numbers.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.570
One, two, three.

03:59.620 --> 04:00.520
Those are these numbers.

04:00.850 --> 04:04.390
And for us, hunger is what we want for a particular sum.

04:04.390 --> 04:05.500
Let's say I want this.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.810
I'm doing diesel by right now.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.520
So what can I do for this?

04:09.520 --> 04:14.530
Someday we we to buy five instead of picking five as the bomb one.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.140
Do you know what I can do is I can just take modulo sums.

04:17.740 --> 04:21.430
So moralism if I do it any number by five.

04:21.460 --> 04:27.790
If I dig more by five, I can get 012348 only four numbers zero one, two, three, four.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.030
So now what I will do is what will be my deep state here?

04:31.150 --> 04:32.680
My deep state will be simple that.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.180
Tell me if.

04:35.080 --> 04:35.840
Or DPA.

04:36.100 --> 04:36.760
I just see.

04:37.780 --> 04:39.160
Tell me if.

04:42.670 --> 04:45.610
Some mard am equals to g.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.050
It's possible.

04:50.890 --> 04:55.240
Basically if one model is on, it's possible to model is possible.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.590
Three more to the same is possible.

04:56.980 --> 05:02.350
Automotive this sum is possible or basically five models of five or ten model of five is possible.

05:02.740 --> 05:11.020
So basically it is nothing but some model and if it is possible for a particular g is possible for first

05:11.020 --> 05:11.650
items.

05:13.840 --> 05:14.320
Items.

05:15.490 --> 05:21.550
Right now, I'm just clarifying on the things regarding to the models here so we can see if I take one

05:21.550 --> 05:23.230
then only this is possible, right?

05:23.230 --> 05:24.580
All the others are not possible.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.100
It means one model of five is only possible.

05:27.580 --> 05:27.940
Correct.

05:28.210 --> 05:28.720
Which is one.

05:29.320 --> 05:33.070
Now if I take two also, then I have two options.

05:33.090 --> 05:35.230
Either I can take two or I can not two.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.180
Well, firstly, let's not take two.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.700
If I don't take two, this is always possible.

05:40.210 --> 05:40.510
Eight.

05:40.990 --> 05:46.330
And if I take two, that means one model was possible.

05:46.330 --> 05:47.510
Two one plus two models.

05:47.560 --> 05:51.640
Five is also possible, which is nothing but the eight.

05:51.910 --> 05:55.510
So I just add one more here and all of others will be zero.

05:56.110 --> 05:56.420
Correct.

05:56.930 --> 05:58.480
Now what about three guys?

05:58.870 --> 06:01.780
So if I don't take three, these two will be possible.

06:02.650 --> 06:04.690
But let's say I take three also.

06:05.050 --> 06:05.620
That means.

06:06.940 --> 06:13.300
This from this will see that one modulo three mode five is possible which is four.

06:13.720 --> 06:18.760
I'll just mark one over here and we can also see that one.

06:18.820 --> 06:21.730
This that means three, three plus three.

06:21.730 --> 06:24.340
Modulo five is also possible and.

06:25.700 --> 06:26.620
That is a.

06:27.590 --> 06:28.790
But okay.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.170
The one place to place.

06:30.950 --> 06:31.160
Yeah.

06:31.340 --> 06:34.460
And that is how much to modify this one.

06:35.060 --> 06:36.890
So this is also possible, right?

06:37.790 --> 06:39.860
I hope I'm not missing something over here.

06:40.400 --> 06:40.670
Yeah.

06:40.700 --> 06:45.230
So one thing that's easily missed, which is this.

06:45.740 --> 06:47.050
This, too, is also possible, right?

06:47.120 --> 06:48.650
Because let's only take two.

06:49.760 --> 06:54.670
So if I only take two, these two will also be possible at the sum of two and four.

06:54.940 --> 07:01.380
And if I had three over here, then you get two plus three more at five, which is zero eight.

07:01.470 --> 07:02.010
There you go.

07:02.010 --> 07:02.700
Two possible.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.960
So here you can see that the modulo some.

07:08.010 --> 07:11.340
Of zero is possible after.

07:11.640 --> 07:11.900
Okay.

07:12.540 --> 07:14.940
One will also come over here so you can see.

07:14.940 --> 07:16.050
You see one is possible.

07:16.050 --> 07:19.380
Two is possible is responsible for it is possible and even zero is possible.

07:20.310 --> 07:26.690
So if I have m that means my columns in this table will be less than M correct.

07:26.700 --> 07:27.870
It will start from zero and go.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.410
And how many rows will be there?

07:31.440 --> 07:37.770
Rows will be equal to the land of the 88 that I know this solution is nothing but equal to MN in into

07:38.400 --> 07:39.180
m solution.

07:39.570 --> 07:43.380
But according to the constraints, we can see that an interim solution won't work.

07:44.010 --> 07:46.320
Eight But what's the catch here?

07:46.650 --> 07:55.590
These are spatial catch and that's very interesting, although it will it will actually revise our mathematics

07:55.590 --> 07:56.100
a little bit.

07:56.550 --> 08:00.390
And I hope this part is very clear how to formulate this table eight.

08:00.690 --> 08:03.300
So for any number, that number is possible.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.130
We'll take just a extra special case, right?

08:05.250 --> 08:09.660
So these don't get confused by, you know, making the 0s1 initially.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.370
Don't make this one.

08:11.910 --> 08:13.740
Don't make this zero is one initially.

08:13.830 --> 08:14.850
Why am I saying so?

08:15.270 --> 08:15.780
Because.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.050
This did do it.

08:20.490 --> 08:20.780
Volume.

08:21.820 --> 08:29.500
When Jay-Z goes to zero represents whether some modulo m is equal to zero possible or not.

08:29.980 --> 08:36.820
This is only possible if I take some subsegments and it is not there someway is some is equal to zero

08:36.820 --> 08:41.050
possible or not it means some more low ambiguous to zero is possible or not.

08:41.050 --> 08:44.380
Basically five, ten, 15, 20.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.460
All of them are low.

08:45.460 --> 08:47.080
Five will give me zero rate.

08:47.440 --> 08:52.390
But this is what this column represents, not whether some of zero is possible or not.

08:53.050 --> 08:55.030
Well, I hope you don't.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.480
Of find this out.

08:57.780 --> 09:01.170
And sometimes it might also represent whether somebody's responsible.

09:01.170 --> 09:02.850
And let's see if the first element is zero.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.980
That means someone zero will be possible.

09:05.340 --> 09:09.320
But indirectly, the role model is equal to zero.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.670
So that will work.

09:14.330 --> 09:17.360
So let's say I have this one five and zero letter.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.110
This is my input.

09:18.580 --> 09:20.150
One element zero five.

09:20.930 --> 09:24.680
It will then be true because zero five is zero wrecked.

09:25.250 --> 09:25.560
Yeah.

09:25.580 --> 09:26.980
So elements can be zero.

09:26.990 --> 09:29.660
But we don't have to initially market in zero.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.280
Let it come.

09:30.620 --> 09:31.760
Let it come to visit.

09:32.570 --> 09:32.780
Right.

09:33.470 --> 09:33.770
Yeah.

09:33.890 --> 09:37.820
So what's the another catch that this problem has?

09:38.460 --> 09:44.090
It's very related to mathematics, and it's very, very, very related to a principle in mathematics.

09:44.390 --> 09:45.590
Let me quickly write it.

09:46.580 --> 09:48.210
It's called P general principle.

09:48.230 --> 09:49.880
I hope you all know about it.

09:50.630 --> 09:54.680
And it's a very, very easy the most easiest thing in mathematics.

09:55.010 --> 09:58.460
And this B general principle is nothing but common sense.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.080
And that means.

10:01.140 --> 10:02.730
If let's say, if there are.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.410
Five pigeonholes.

10:07.180 --> 10:07.970
Visual aid.

10:08.280 --> 10:11.640
That means there are five pigeonholes.

10:13.710 --> 10:13.940
Right.

10:14.190 --> 10:15.080
And I have.

10:15.090 --> 10:16.710
So I have six pigeons.

10:19.530 --> 10:20.300
I have six positions.

10:20.310 --> 10:21.750
I want to put them six.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.990
Put this experience into five pigeonholes.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.250
That means at least.

10:27.700 --> 10:29.680
At least one pigeonhole.

10:34.840 --> 10:35.560
We'll have.

10:37.740 --> 10:40.560
Two or more regions.

10:42.950 --> 10:43.200
Okay.

10:43.310 --> 10:50.210
So basically, if the number of pigeons is greater than the pigeon holes, it means an all of the pigeon

10:50.210 --> 10:51.230
holes will contain.

10:52.010 --> 10:57.750
So any of the pigeon holes may contain zero, although they can have zero pigeon also.

10:57.950 --> 11:03.680
For example, let's put all its experience in this book and it will be correct that at least one pigeon

11:03.680 --> 11:05.720
hole will have two or more pigeons.

11:06.410 --> 11:08.340
So this is pigeon will be it is common sense.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.980
Also, we can also say it's common sense.

11:10.430 --> 11:10.690
Eight.

11:11.600 --> 11:11.900
Yeah.

11:12.860 --> 11:16.730
Well, Howard, is this pigeon hole principle related to the problem?

11:16.760 --> 11:20.600
Let me quickly add some space here and then we will.

11:22.570 --> 11:22.760
Okay.

11:23.220 --> 11:24.000
Just imagine.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.070
Just imagine that end is greater than him.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.270
And it's very nice.

11:27.270 --> 11:31.500
It's very easy approach, but it's a very nice approach that Alexa is greater than him.

11:31.740 --> 11:39.470
And so for now, I'm just taking an example and let's say I'm is five and is six or seven or can be

11:39.480 --> 11:40.020
any value.

11:40.980 --> 11:41.610
Let me take it.

11:45.770 --> 11:46.990
So this is a.

11:48.110 --> 11:53.330
And as it goes to air right now and instead of feeling values over reality, there are some excellent

11:53.330 --> 11:56.900
x2x3x4x5x6.

11:57.850 --> 12:01.000
x7x8x9.

12:01.650 --> 12:04.090
Okay, so later there are these x nine values.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.830
Let me give more space.

12:09.000 --> 12:09.330
Yep.

12:09.360 --> 12:13.590
So what I will do is I will take the prefix sums.

12:14.070 --> 12:16.530
So we all know that a somebody.

12:17.810 --> 12:18.740
In a subsequent.

12:23.790 --> 12:26.940
So if I'm able to prove that, what end?

12:27.090 --> 12:32.610
If end is greater than them, then there is a sub area with the modulus.

12:32.610 --> 12:34.520
I'm equal to zero eight.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.890
That means there is a subsequent bid.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.790
Some which is divisible by it.

12:39.330 --> 12:39.690
Correct.

12:39.990 --> 12:43.860
Because so therefore I do the subsequent which is all the possible eight.

12:44.040 --> 12:48.690
So what I'll do is I'll take the prefix sums, but let's dig deeper if examine let's name them b1,

12:49.230 --> 12:56.370
b2, b3 before b5 b6 b7 b eight and B9 eight.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.770
Basically what is any one of them?

12:58.770 --> 12:59.730
It is nothing but.

13:00.920 --> 13:01.700
Or this before.

13:02.030 --> 13:08.600
Or instead for this paper is submission of essays from a equals 212 equals two.

13:10.870 --> 13:12.220
Accommodate the.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.850
Hate to be the is.

13:15.090 --> 13:19.560
I mean you know I go through and do I equals to date somebody for example we all know this.

13:20.340 --> 13:27.630
Well know just tell me one thing that what I will do is instead of just finding out the victims, the

13:27.900 --> 13:30.930
better would be to take victims, more eliminate.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.700
So here what I do is I it because it's not equal to to fix them more glue him.

13:36.780 --> 13:38.490
Getting through the.

13:39.460 --> 13:44.560
All these values which are B1, B2, B3 before B5.

13:47.170 --> 13:48.710
He said when bearded, benign.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.830
They all are less than him because I have taken them.

13:52.840 --> 13:53.380
All right.

13:54.130 --> 13:56.670
So I will just show you.

13:56.680 --> 13:57.950
Why am I doing all of this?

13:57.970 --> 14:02.170
Because let's bring in a brief example, and I've just taken their models.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.550
Now, why are we doing this?

14:03.550 --> 14:07.170
Because here we can see all those values are less in eight.

14:07.360 --> 14:12.160
So here we can see that end is equal to nine rates and is equal to nine.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.660
And let's Americans to fight.

14:14.350 --> 14:16.210
We are taking a case, Bill, and these are greater than them.

14:16.990 --> 14:22.900
So if all these values are less than five, then the values can only be zero one, two, three or four

14:23.470 --> 14:23.740
eight.

14:23.890 --> 14:28.990
So they tell me if all these values can be only zero and do three or four, then there will be at least

14:28.990 --> 14:30.280
one value which is repeating.

14:31.190 --> 14:32.570
That's general principle, right?

14:33.020 --> 14:34.970
So if B one is zero, it is one.

14:34.970 --> 14:35.300
It is true.

14:35.300 --> 14:41.180
It is to do this for let's assume then P six has to be one of zeros, one stools, three or four.

14:41.180 --> 14:41.480
Right?

14:41.480 --> 14:42.860
It has to be one of these values.

14:42.860 --> 14:43.890
Only eight.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.200
That means there.

14:46.260 --> 14:46.620
Is.

14:48.390 --> 14:52.530
There is at least one value which is repeating out of these five values.

14:52.830 --> 14:54.380
There is one repeating value.

14:54.390 --> 14:56.160
That's the main part of the problem.

14:57.030 --> 14:57.690
But let's see.

14:58.800 --> 15:04.650
If B three was equal to some number in one of these five values, and B seven is also equal to this

15:04.650 --> 15:08.700
number only, which is related, B seven is equal to P3 eight.

15:08.790 --> 15:12.660
So we all know that there will be one really, which is the at least one value, if any, is greater

15:12.660 --> 15:13.020
than them.

15:13.500 --> 15:22.500
But because we have m different values to give, but the, the place holders which need those values

15:22.500 --> 15:23.340
are greater.

15:24.090 --> 15:28.440
Eight So if those place or less are greater than him, then simply there will be some values repeating.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.420
Now let's repeat it is equal to P7.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.800
What does this mean?

15:31.980 --> 15:36.780
If B is equal to P7, there are two speeds repeat reason x one plus sextuplets x three.

15:37.660 --> 15:38.010
Correct.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.990
And what is b7 it is examined by sextuplets x three.

15:41.970 --> 15:46.460
Plus x four plus x five, six, six, six, seven and eight.

15:46.890 --> 15:48.300
I'm saying both of them are equal.

15:48.300 --> 15:48.870
That means.

15:49.910 --> 15:51.350
These values.

15:51.470 --> 15:55.430
That means this x4 2x7 which is excellent x four plus x five.

15:56.350 --> 15:57.910
Plus x x plus x seven.

15:59.200 --> 16:06.910
Their model awesome is he goes to zero correct or not because I hope you remember that when we want

16:06.910 --> 16:07.380
to find out.

16:07.390 --> 16:13.420
But if someone for particular at what we do is we say but if for example, odd minus but if example.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.100
L minus one.

16:15.620 --> 16:15.970
Correct.

16:16.460 --> 16:21.110
So here's what I'm doing is I'm saying L minus one is equal to three and our is equal to seven.

16:21.410 --> 16:23.920
So L is equal to four and it is equal to seven.

16:23.930 --> 16:26.090
That means I'm at a 4 to 7.

16:26.630 --> 16:34.730
There some modulo m will be zero because we get three is equal to b78.

16:34.730 --> 16:36.620
So B3 is equal to be seven.

16:37.250 --> 16:43.040
If what is values are same, that means the area which is bounded by them, they will have a sum which

16:43.040 --> 16:43.970
is zero eight.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.190
So there's some exactly min or b zero.

16:46.190 --> 16:50.000
But when I, when I take more and by that it will be zero.

16:50.600 --> 16:50.990
Correct.

16:51.110 --> 16:54.410
Because we can easily see there's some side equal eight.

16:54.560 --> 17:01.100
So also what I can do, I can write it as like this also that B3 plus x4.

17:01.990 --> 17:05.740
X four plus x five +6667.

17:06.580 --> 17:07.600
Modulo m.

17:08.760 --> 17:13.080
Izzy goes to Peacehaven and we can see that Peter is he goes to Peacehaven.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.060
That means this is equal to zero.

17:15.060 --> 17:16.680
So we can provide this filter.

17:17.490 --> 17:23.970
So if there if there are zero, then there will be a summary which will have a model equal to zero.

17:23.970 --> 17:25.200
That means it is.

17:25.980 --> 17:28.040
It means that somebody is diesel y.

17:29.010 --> 17:30.450
That's a and we know that.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.740
So there is also a subsequent.

17:31.740 --> 17:35.250
So basically, if any is greater than him, then there will be.

17:36.950 --> 17:37.530
Also buried.

17:37.610 --> 17:40.550
There will be a summary which will be diesel back and.

17:41.560 --> 17:46.540
Well, I hope this is very clear to for and then and we know it will be true.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.750
Now, what about the second case when and less than he goes to it?

17:50.110 --> 17:54.640
So now we can see where the concern for him is concerned of damage to the power.

17:56.270 --> 17:56.980
And we know that.

17:56.990 --> 17:58.400
And it's now less than equal to him.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.750
So basically and we'll all trivialize and he goes through ten inches about three eight.

18:01.850 --> 18:03.900
So what if end is greater than that?

18:03.920 --> 18:08.090
Then do we know it is true if any is greater than 8 to 4 and greater than him?

18:08.420 --> 18:11.120
Answer is nothing but true that yes did exist.

18:11.690 --> 18:15.440
But if any less than equal to him, and will be less than including his to the power three.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.840
That means now I can do.

18:18.080 --> 18:22.070
I can use my and undo him approach that I discussed earlier.

18:23.070 --> 18:23.430
Correct.

18:24.650 --> 18:27.530
This is an example that we already discussed the substitution problem.

18:28.790 --> 18:32.820
So here just one thing that now you need to use modulo just remember one thing.

18:32.820 --> 18:38.630
Just remember this basically case of this zero column and whenever you're updating anything, just update

18:38.630 --> 18:40.340
it by taking Mode eight.

18:40.670 --> 18:45.170
If you are on the question three just and you're updating some exercise three.

18:45.170 --> 18:47.900
But as I say, mortem should be updated, correct?

18:48.680 --> 18:48.980
So.

18:50.310 --> 18:52.650
That's what I wanted to tell you about models.

18:53.340 --> 18:58.440
This model listing is very interesting, actually, because, you know, it actually goes in a cycle.

19:00.070 --> 19:03.910
You know, more and more little is discovered in the computer programming course.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.750
And yeah, so let's see in the next part.

19:07.750 --> 19:08.560
I'm not cutting it.

19:08.560 --> 19:14.500
I'm just leaving the code to you eight and we'll see this in the next meeting.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.310
We might see some of the problems in the.

19:18.220 --> 19:18.910
Well, thanks.
