WEBVTT

00:00.470 --> 00:00.730
Yep.

00:00.770 --> 00:03.980
So let's solve this problem using bottom of approach.

00:05.030 --> 00:06.470
And that is also very easy, right?

00:06.920 --> 00:07.220
Well, it's.

00:07.250 --> 00:08.390
I have this two strings.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.630
Food and money.

00:12.350 --> 00:14.510
But what happens in a bottom up approach?

00:15.260 --> 00:17.330
You're trying to build answers from one end.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.750
So in this case, what I will say is it.

00:22.090 --> 00:26.950
And J0 and what will be our state idea.

00:26.980 --> 00:27.820
What it will be.

00:27.850 --> 00:30.130
It will be nothing but same state.

00:30.340 --> 00:31.660
Medium number of operations.

00:32.740 --> 00:37.720
Minimum number of operations required to perform.

00:38.650 --> 00:40.690
I mean, required to edit e.

00:42.200 --> 00:47.960
Thing to be in this case, what evil become it will become zero two.

00:48.290 --> 00:52.580
I and I want it to be from zero to.

00:53.840 --> 01:02.270
Have you got this i ltd was I to end due to end nowadays the roadway and zero to do a first.

01:04.270 --> 01:10.150
Initially when I was doing this job don't approach it was be considered for the suffix.

01:11.670 --> 01:13.110
The thing that I was worried about.

01:13.440 --> 01:13.710
Yeah.

01:14.190 --> 01:15.090
These are suffixes.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.710
Right now.

01:18.720 --> 01:19.860
I'm taking the Stringer's.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.340
Now I'm digging the strongest prefix.

01:25.310 --> 01:25.570
Well.

01:26.870 --> 01:27.890
So what's needed here?

01:29.120 --> 01:30.170
MGM.

01:30.860 --> 01:35.150
Of all the steps, all do the same steps, only in this case know what will happen.

01:35.870 --> 01:37.400
Things that will remain.

01:38.090 --> 01:40.880
The things that will remain are these and these.

01:41.430 --> 01:45.290
And it will be back to the operations that will be.

01:45.290 --> 01:48.260
There are nothing but deep ideas because minimum of.

01:49.870 --> 01:50.500
Deep.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.870
I minus one go major plus one.

01:54.380 --> 01:59.990
They in this case, we not have a plus one minus one will be there and it will be a comma minus one

02:00.140 --> 02:00.650
plus one.

02:00.920 --> 02:01.940
It's the same process.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.700
You just think about inserting, deleting and replacing.

02:05.880 --> 02:09.210
It is a minus one goal margin minus one plus one.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.400
Whatever is going on, I'll take them.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.150
And if they are equal, then it is nothing really cool to.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.220
UPI comma.

02:17.820 --> 02:21.980
There is nothing more equal to the pie plus one plus.

02:23.670 --> 02:24.780
A minus one comma.

02:24.780 --> 02:25.260
J minus.

02:26.590 --> 02:29.380
And now you just have to call this your.

02:32.030 --> 02:32.740
Part of my approach.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.420
And and there's one thing that you need to keep in mind.

02:35.540 --> 02:41.780
These cases, these three base cases, how we handle these three base cases, what I'll do is I just

02:42.020 --> 02:44.060
let's let's make a table.

02:44.450 --> 02:46.280
And I do understand this part.

02:50.760 --> 02:51.850
I mean, certainly.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.120
So what is the length of food?

02:54.470 --> 02:55.770
Food land is.

02:57.400 --> 02:57.770
Or.

02:57.790 --> 03:00.790
And my niece land is five, so I'll take land plus one.

03:00.910 --> 03:06.050
Because you must be remembering that I was I all this talk about empty springs also eight.

03:06.070 --> 03:09.930
So we need to keep our empty things into consideration because those are our bases.

03:12.040 --> 03:12.250
Yeah.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.790
One plus one is five and manipulation is six.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.400
So let me insert a table of five or six.

03:20.930 --> 03:24.770
Five cross experts, six across five by cross.

03:39.980 --> 03:43.280
So this is a normal table and it quickly.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.590
It's quickly filled.

03:46.710 --> 03:49.310
So this represents F.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.340
Whoo hoo!

03:51.810 --> 03:52.150
EE.

03:52.600 --> 03:52.820
Good.

03:53.410 --> 03:55.120
And this represents money.

03:56.380 --> 04:03.280
And when these are the modest things that are base cases, the first index is zero one, two, three,

04:03.280 --> 04:03.850
four, five.

04:03.880 --> 04:04.840
I'm just indexing it.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.260
Two, three, four, eight.

04:07.810 --> 04:09.160
Let's let's fill the tables.

04:09.790 --> 04:16.270
Tell me at a distance required if I convert empty string 20 string zero eight.

04:16.540 --> 04:17.440
Let me switch colors.

04:19.790 --> 04:21.740
You know, any distance required.

04:21.770 --> 04:26.210
If I empty to him, fine to be full fight.

04:26.420 --> 04:34.460
I hope these basic cases are very clear that this means I'm converting ammo to this empty, destroying

04:35.210 --> 04:36.920
it, and similarly.

04:37.970 --> 04:38.780
This is mean.

04:39.620 --> 04:41.720
And when he's been converted to this.

04:41.900 --> 04:42.170
Right.

04:42.470 --> 04:44.030
Because what is the sale?

04:44.030 --> 04:45.500
The sale is for and zero.

04:45.510 --> 04:50.780
That means it is deep zero, comma four, which means it's an empty string.

04:51.670 --> 04:51.810
Right.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.760
And this is the first word.

04:53.760 --> 04:54.330
Prefixes.

04:55.080 --> 04:55.320
Well.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.040
Now how to move downwards here.

05:05.440 --> 05:05.880
I'm.

05:07.400 --> 05:13.130
But what I've noticed is that if you keep speaking for a very long time, your nose.

05:13.570 --> 05:14.080
Okay.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.460
And, yeah, let's move.

05:17.090 --> 05:18.640
And this is good.

05:20.600 --> 05:26.300
This is one, two, three and four because it means converting this empty string into these strings.

05:27.180 --> 05:28.080
I hope this is clear.

05:28.710 --> 05:29.820
And what about this place?

05:31.560 --> 05:35.280
We'll just simply check if it's not equal to him.

05:35.610 --> 05:36.930
We've have is not equal to him.

05:37.140 --> 05:38.070
This thing applies.

05:39.600 --> 05:39.830
Right.

05:40.050 --> 05:46.800
That is minimum of the pi minus one g where desirement is 1gi management is one row above NGC that means

05:46.800 --> 05:48.780
one minimum of this one.

05:48.990 --> 05:52.410
This one and this zero is zero less.

05:52.410 --> 05:52.950
One will be.

05:53.400 --> 05:53.670
But.

05:54.830 --> 05:58.470
A minimum of all these three places.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.120
That's one.

06:00.550 --> 06:01.600
I hope it.

06:03.050 --> 06:03.980
Similarly.

06:05.690 --> 06:05.920
Yeah.

06:05.960 --> 06:10.070
Similarly for this, it will be a minimum of these three, which is one plus minus.

06:11.240 --> 06:14.270
Look now before five.

06:14.730 --> 06:15.530
I can see this.

06:18.360 --> 06:18.790
And.

06:20.870 --> 06:27.740
I hope that things have been cleared so you can feel all the rest of the table by just.

06:29.040 --> 06:29.700
Having this.

06:30.620 --> 06:31.130
In mind.

06:31.640 --> 06:37.220
Also know if you're feeling this similar to you're feeling this salvages Tacoma to sell.

06:37.580 --> 06:40.100
In that case guys are easy.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.240
Goes to be great.

06:41.580 --> 06:42.170
Leave the boat.

06:42.170 --> 06:42.500
As in.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.590
Then what will be the answer?

06:43.590 --> 06:45.330
It will be nothing but whatever is kept here.

06:45.350 --> 06:46.040
It will be fine.

06:47.210 --> 06:52.730
This keep this case also in mind when they were equal rate so quickly let's call this.

06:55.480 --> 06:55.810
Okay.

06:55.870 --> 06:56.600
Let's go.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.640
Discreetly.

06:58.990 --> 06:59.530
And.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.900
Or maybe you can go do it yourself.

07:03.930 --> 07:04.620
It's very easy.

07:04.980 --> 07:10.260
Just make a table, fill the base cases, and apply these to cases.

07:11.420 --> 07:12.140
But all the debris.

07:12.590 --> 07:14.390
And finally, what will be the answer?

07:14.690 --> 07:15.890
The answer will be on the last.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.780
Is it be in Goma?

07:19.230 --> 07:21.670
And is this Mr. Eight?

07:21.990 --> 07:24.630
I'm just leaving it to you and you can easily go.

07:24.810 --> 07:28.420
I've already filled half of the table except the word now eight.

07:28.860 --> 07:32.070
And maybe that will help you understand more.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.950
So this is the beginning of the real strings.

07:35.950 --> 07:39.540
And after this, we'll be solving all the your interesting problems you came up.

07:41.590 --> 07:42.340
In the next part.
