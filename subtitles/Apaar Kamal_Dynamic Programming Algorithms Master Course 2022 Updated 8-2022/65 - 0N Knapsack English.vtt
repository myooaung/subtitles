00:00.520 --> 00:00.840
Yep.

00:00.970 --> 00:04.510
So let's put the zero in knapsack problem.

00:05.510 --> 00:10.040
You all know how to solve it because we have discussed the very same thing in the substitution problem.

00:10.040 --> 00:10.340
Right.

00:10.730 --> 00:15.440
And if the elements are repeating, then what is the substance and possible or not in zero nets?

00:15.440 --> 00:15.610
Leipsic.

00:15.620 --> 00:17.090
What's the catch?

00:17.300 --> 00:20.600
The catch is that any item can be used multiple number of times.

00:20.990 --> 00:26.880
For example, here you can see that or fill this knapsack of food.

00:27.170 --> 00:29.060
Now this item one is.

00:30.310 --> 00:32.380
Has this in finite capacity, basically.

00:33.520 --> 00:38.440
Item by the first item, which has size of one and value of it, it can be used again and again, again

00:38.440 --> 00:44.290
and again to fill this knapsack separately or for if it can be used again and again to fill the knapsack

00:44.290 --> 00:48.100
capacity of four, then it will be used for down three.

00:48.490 --> 00:50.590
What's the total value that will take care?

00:51.580 --> 00:54.550
But nobody will be able to do what we just heard you do.

00:56.400 --> 00:56.660
Right.

00:57.360 --> 01:03.300
And I think that will be the maximum, because, again, you can also figure out why won't you really

01:03.300 --> 01:04.010
work in this?

01:04.020 --> 01:06.090
And there are various approaches.

01:06.540 --> 01:12.510
But I just want to I just want you to know the because of religion that will form effects on my way

01:12.540 --> 01:13.920
from X items tell me.

01:15.350 --> 01:18.530
The maximum value fit by capacity.

01:19.160 --> 01:19.940
There are two options.

01:20.480 --> 01:26.150
If I did not include the current element or I included element ones, or I can include an element twice,

01:26.150 --> 01:27.440
thrice or times.

01:27.860 --> 01:31.070
We all know we all have derived this in the subsequent problem.

01:31.070 --> 01:34.760
We all have derived the reconciliation.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.470
So I just directly related here.

01:37.100 --> 01:40.040
But if I am not including it, let me right exclude.

01:41.700 --> 01:42.660
They go ahead.

01:42.660 --> 01:43.470
It will be simple.

01:43.530 --> 01:45.480
It will be x comma by.

01:46.370 --> 01:47.930
Three X minus one.

01:50.510 --> 01:54.080
X minus one game away because not including it.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.260
Not including you to tell me the best answer from the rest of others.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.940
Otherwise, if I'm including it, then we like including multiple number of times eight.

02:02.270 --> 02:07.010
So it will be nothing but f of x comma by minus of.

02:08.310 --> 02:08.940
As of.

02:10.680 --> 02:11.110
X.

02:12.390 --> 02:13.170
What does this mean?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.780
Why am not why I'm not doing x minus one?

02:15.780 --> 02:19.440
And we all know this because we have thought about it.

02:19.440 --> 02:23.880
We have dived deeper into the subject problem rate in which we saw that.

02:25.890 --> 02:31.890
Instead of, you know, moving instead of saying, one, two, three, four, five, six, they include

02:31.890 --> 02:35.430
the right number one number of time to a number of time, three number of time for number of time and

02:35.430 --> 02:35.790
so on.

02:35.790 --> 02:36.210
They learned.

02:36.540 --> 02:37.810
What I have done is as it.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.730
Included as an excluded are included ones.

02:42.740 --> 02:47.490
But then see, they took this f of x comma y minus x means it currently.

02:47.810 --> 02:51.440
Now I can again add their excluded or included.

02:52.160 --> 02:52.430
Right.

02:52.670 --> 02:53.180
That means.

02:53.180 --> 02:56.120
Let me just leave it if you have forgotten about it.

02:56.530 --> 03:00.290
But now again, I can exclude the current element or include the content.

03:00.500 --> 03:00.920
Now what?

03:00.920 --> 03:02.580
What is the reconciliation?

03:03.860 --> 03:05.300
If I'm excluding it, it is nothing.

03:05.300 --> 03:09.380
Word X of F of x minus one.

03:09.380 --> 03:11.240
Comma VI minus six.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.340
And the second one is f off.

03:15.990 --> 03:18.240
X comma via minus two S6.

03:19.050 --> 03:19.470
Correct.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.470
If I'm enjoying it.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.650
So of course we will be adding the value.

03:24.650 --> 03:25.670
Don't forget about it.

03:25.700 --> 03:26.750
Value is always there.

03:27.200 --> 03:32.470
I know nothing about this that we started from x going away, but what is this value?

03:32.480 --> 03:35.090
This means that I'm including it one number of time.

03:35.090 --> 03:40.340
Exactly one number of time that I've taken by minus six here.

03:40.550 --> 03:43.790
And we have blessed Victoria eight plus we.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.620
And second thing is.

03:47.020 --> 03:47.860
What does this mean?

03:48.460 --> 03:51.730
That I'm not that I'm including it to a number of times.

03:52.030 --> 03:56.560
So it is at least two number of times because you can see the state is exactly here.

03:57.640 --> 04:04.090
But again, if I excluded and included what it is, I get F of x minus one comma, y minus two, six.

04:05.490 --> 04:05.860
Correct.

04:06.120 --> 04:06.720
What is this?

04:06.750 --> 04:09.270
This means I've included exactly two number of times.

04:09.270 --> 04:12.990
And now the second state I did it is V minus three or six.

04:14.140 --> 04:15.670
I will getting the whole point there.

04:16.480 --> 04:23.910
We have also discussed this in detail that these two equations, if combined recursively, because they

04:24.000 --> 04:29.970
call each other recursively, they will form out of all the cases to include them or to exclude them.

04:29.980 --> 04:31.540
One, two, three, four, five, six.

04:31.540 --> 04:32.850
Number of times eight.

04:33.130 --> 04:36.220
Basically, if I want to write it in pure English that.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.010
What does these dates mean to this?

04:39.010 --> 04:39.910
Trevino What did you mean?

04:39.910 --> 04:41.460
This means from X minus one.

04:41.470 --> 04:43.360
If we had the capacity of why, tell me the best answer.

04:43.360 --> 04:49.840
But this means that if I'm including at least one number of time.

04:51.850 --> 04:52.360
A number of.

04:53.560 --> 04:53.830
Eight.

04:54.250 --> 05:02.170
And this date F of x minus x minus one common by minus six will mean that I'm including it exactly one

05:02.170 --> 05:02.830
number of time.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.180
I just want you to understand this difference.

05:09.510 --> 05:14.070
Of course, you might have already understood this because you discussed the same in the subject.

05:14.070 --> 05:14.700
Some problem.

05:14.910 --> 05:15.900
But this is important.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.550
This is very important.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.520
So let's call this and I think.

05:23.430 --> 05:28.430
This is the code that I provided you in the tabular in the resource section of the previous video.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.730
This is the tabular core, right?

05:30.030 --> 05:34.620
And we know we know very easy how to call this problem now, which is nothing.

05:34.620 --> 05:40.950
But instead of my explanation, what I have is I have X over here, what I lose instead of making this

05:40.950 --> 05:43.920
j loop going the reverse order, I just make this j loop.

05:44.490 --> 05:45.000
Wendy.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.060
Forward order, basically.

05:48.810 --> 05:49.160
Yeah.

05:49.200 --> 05:52.140
So now this is nothing but zero in knapsack.

05:56.060 --> 05:56.580
Zero.

05:57.140 --> 05:58.840
And epic.

05:59.660 --> 06:06.500
Because now any x minus any extended x depends on x minus one, which is already there because I have

06:06.500 --> 06:07.260
the singularity.

06:07.280 --> 06:11.330
And the other thing is depends on these same rules.

06:11.330 --> 06:15.500
Previous value depends on the same rules previously the same rules.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.940
Previous values should be updated.

06:17.360 --> 06:21.470
It will only be updated if I'll start from blank and keep on updating.

06:22.280 --> 06:22.550
They?

06:23.550 --> 06:26.610
So that's it, guys, in the next part.
