WEBVTT

00:00.680 --> 00:01.750
So let's start with the.

00:04.520 --> 00:05.150
Brute force.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.940
Did we have this this initially?

00:09.230 --> 00:11.020
Finally, that means we have 100.

00:11.210 --> 00:12.410
Finally, and we will.

00:12.410 --> 00:15.020
What we'll do is when we have hundred guys.

00:15.290 --> 00:16.780
Ten, 20, 30, 40.

00:16.790 --> 00:17.900
This is the.

00:18.980 --> 00:19.640
Destination.

00:19.640 --> 00:24.650
What we'll do is we'll be divided into two parts, as in here or here or here.

00:25.320 --> 00:25.530
Okay.

00:25.550 --> 00:26.510
So we have two parts.

00:28.770 --> 00:29.310
That means.

00:29.580 --> 00:31.740
Okay, let me write it in the index for you.

00:32.580 --> 00:35.630
Initially the 0 to 3 I've defined down from 0 to 3.

00:35.640 --> 00:41.800
What I'll do is I'll simply find the answer from 0 to 0 first because I'm this means I'm having this

00:42.060 --> 00:49.200
first group which is 020 find answer from 1 to 3 and add them in return.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.090
Me right was the second good?

00:51.240 --> 00:53.760
This is the second good for the second year.

00:53.770 --> 00:57.420
This second is about 0 to 1 and 2 to 3.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.820
And what's the third grade about?

01:02.430 --> 01:04.600
The third card is about zero two.

01:05.040 --> 01:05.340
Who?

01:06.500 --> 01:06.920
And.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.370
You do that with this group?

01:11.910 --> 01:18.230
So I hope you got what I mean from going in the opposite order that finally this will be the solution.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.340
But where is this final solution coming from?

01:20.790 --> 01:21.630
It is ever coming.

01:22.140 --> 01:23.670
It will only come from two places.

01:24.300 --> 01:24.620
Eight.

01:25.820 --> 01:26.060
This.

01:26.060 --> 01:28.310
This, this, this or this?

01:28.310 --> 01:28.550
This.

01:29.540 --> 01:29.800
Right.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.250
So.

01:32.780 --> 01:33.060
Yeah.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.510
So let's root for a solution first.

01:43.800 --> 01:48.180
So of course we can name the states that states naming is not that of let's name the states.

01:48.540 --> 01:52.510
The state is normally by committee, which means give me the best answer.

01:52.530 --> 01:56.370
If I read from it, today is being used.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.310
So the minimum.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.430
Cost of operations.

02:07.930 --> 02:13.330
Eddie Edwards used to let me read Rufus and.

02:15.880 --> 02:20.230
I hope you understood the brute force rate, but I am not moving on to the solution.

02:21.370 --> 02:24.960
Just writing a brute force solution to what stuck any.

02:25.860 --> 02:27.030
And it is 400.

02:31.640 --> 02:35.060
Well, yeah, it's taken.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.880
Also we will be nearing the area.

02:40.960 --> 02:41.250
Eight.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.730
Who at stake?

02:47.190 --> 02:50.040
It's making zero base index only not a big deal.

02:50.890 --> 02:51.020
Yeah.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.960
Let's deejay again.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.550
And now we will simply select BP zero command minus one.

02:59.950 --> 03:02.230
Well, what does this do better than me?

03:02.440 --> 03:04.150
It has two places, Eleanor.

03:04.540 --> 03:05.080
Look at this.

03:05.080 --> 03:05.560
Is there.

03:05.590 --> 03:06.550
Give me the best answer.

03:06.910 --> 03:07.660
The foreign editor.

03:07.660 --> 03:08.500
What can he do?

03:08.950 --> 03:11.890
If I write brute force, he can cut their head into two parts.

03:11.890 --> 03:13.270
They look at this is the first part.

03:13.270 --> 03:15.530
This will finally become one particular value.

03:15.550 --> 03:16.500
This is the second part.

03:16.510 --> 03:18.010
This will become one particular value.

03:19.290 --> 03:20.760
Give me the best chance of the first fight.

03:20.760 --> 03:24.090
Give me the best chance for the second part, and then we'll combine the one.

03:24.420 --> 03:27.630
I start with the second part and get the coffee right.

03:28.110 --> 03:28.380
So.

03:31.400 --> 03:40.340
So let's initially answer it zero and let's start A from L and let's make it go to what these many girls

03:40.340 --> 03:40.870
will have to.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.730
From the islands, that is.

03:44.730 --> 03:46.800
And so we live and many Spaniards hate.

03:47.070 --> 03:48.750
But what if I is equals to it?

03:48.840 --> 03:53.220
It means that I'm talking about from L to eight and I plus one.

03:53.220 --> 03:54.930
Two are there are two parts.

03:54.930 --> 03:58.500
I'm making this cut between I, I enables one.

03:59.740 --> 04:04.300
Well so what we'll have we'll have answers, Max of answer combined BP.

04:04.810 --> 04:06.550
Well, right now I'm talking about the first part.

04:06.550 --> 04:11.150
The first part is starting from l going to like l do it eight.

04:11.350 --> 04:16.030
And the second part is going from I plus one to IDE because I have this guide from.

04:18.790 --> 04:19.140
I have.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.770
I've discovered between I you know your bliss when I'm making that part.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.830
Plus, what is the cost, guys?

04:23.840 --> 04:25.000
What is the cost of this?

04:25.010 --> 04:30.200
If I'm having this go between l do I n I wonder what the cost of it will be.

04:30.380 --> 04:33.980
Very simple rate, because both of them will combine into one particular value.

04:35.210 --> 04:39.560
Hey, that means the Eddie Alvarez win combined into one rally.

04:40.130 --> 04:44.510
If they're a risk combining into one value value, their loss will be equal to the sum of the summary.

04:45.260 --> 04:45.950
What example?

04:46.370 --> 04:48.910
In this case, it was under two eight.

04:50.810 --> 04:54.260
Because this 10 to 40 is being combined to find it.

04:54.470 --> 04:55.220
Now, let's see.

04:56.280 --> 05:00.210
Let's have this that only ten, 20, 30, 40, 50.

05:00.210 --> 05:03.380
And I know I'm talking about this already rate.

05:03.390 --> 05:06.840
So for this nobody goes first card will be made here, second grade will be made here.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.910
But cost of both the cards will be same.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.920
What will be the cost of both the cards?

05:13.300 --> 05:20.620
The cost of the guards will be equal to 50 plus 40 plus 30 because BP means that this is the final step.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.320
When I'm getting this answer, it's the final step.

05:23.380 --> 05:25.450
This whole area has been shrink to 1 million.

05:26.270 --> 05:32.530
That's that answer is being calculated by BP by further dividing this added pool.

05:33.590 --> 05:35.240
So what is the cost value?

05:35.360 --> 05:40.430
So instead of taking cost value here, what we can do is we can add cost value later in month.

05:40.430 --> 05:48.560
So because cost is seen for all the goods, so cost will be equal to some from L to what the error is,

05:48.560 --> 05:49.250
some to.

05:49.320 --> 05:53.970
So let's write a function which will return me the sum from L2 eight.

05:54.350 --> 05:56.330
So what I can do is I can take up and fix them.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.390
Let me take a prefix, Eddie.

06:01.030 --> 06:04.510
Prefix and we all know how to calculate prefix sums.

06:04.960 --> 06:10.330
If i.e. let's say prefix i classic goes to prefix i minus one.

06:11.420 --> 06:11.710
They?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.760
The fix of IED goes to a.

06:18.770 --> 06:19.170
Well, this.

06:19.670 --> 06:23.870
So this is normal prefix calculation and this is some primary to it.

06:24.110 --> 06:26.090
So it's zero based indexing that means.

06:27.780 --> 06:36.620
The sum should contain prefix odd minus prefix, but if excel minus one, this should be the same rate.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.460
But what if L is equal to zero?

06:39.270 --> 06:43.320
That will have a special case and it's just right in one line.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.510
Only if Eliquis two zero.

06:47.000 --> 06:47.660
Underdone.

06:49.390 --> 06:49.780
Zero.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.350
The race written prefix of Halloween is one.

06:54.410 --> 06:57.890
Well, and let me simply write it.

06:58.220 --> 06:59.990
I hope this works for all of us.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.500
If early zero, I don't have to subtract anything.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.780
I don't have to subtract the effects of el minus on.

07:06.350 --> 07:08.450
This is the sum and I simply didn't answer.

07:11.360 --> 07:11.700
Got it.

07:11.720 --> 07:16.940
So here what we have is we have this advice that is actually being done.

07:16.940 --> 07:22.130
So because normally calculating max and not calculating minimum and regulating maximum rate.

07:22.130 --> 07:23.120
So let's take minimum.

07:25.550 --> 07:26.120
Well, it's a hit.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.010
I would hope so, but.

07:29.720 --> 07:30.470
Is this?

07:31.280 --> 07:32.450
The correct solution?

07:33.220 --> 07:33.440
Sure.

07:33.500 --> 07:34.550
Should it be hundred days?

07:36.100 --> 07:36.310
No.

07:36.310 --> 07:36.630
Right.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.420
Let me check.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.820
Where am I going wrong?

07:40.630 --> 07:44.470
If I want something from a steward where Alan ordered inclusive.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.460
If that is, you know, this advice.

07:47.510 --> 07:47.840
Okay.

07:48.670 --> 07:48.930
Okay.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.080
So let's take it for a small case.

07:51.650 --> 07:52.460
And in 20.

07:53.930 --> 07:54.290
Okay.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.760
I got the problem.

07:55.910 --> 07:57.290
The problem is that I don't have a.

07:58.320 --> 08:03.060
This case is basic, is needed case if l is equal to r.

08:04.190 --> 08:07.100
If Al is equal to Khaled, what happens when Al is equal to ah.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.260
If there's only one value added security, then zero.

08:12.710 --> 08:13.040
Eight.

08:18.880 --> 08:24.030
If it is equal to what I have put it in zero because I can't combine one single area value three to

08:24.340 --> 08:25.510
Google Glass has to be zero.

08:25.990 --> 08:30.610
There's something that is missing in the brute force solution.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.230
That's why we're not getting a correct answer.

08:32.590 --> 08:34.450
Let me talk about these three items.

08:36.000 --> 08:36.750
20 and 30.

08:37.290 --> 08:38.160
What should be the answer?

08:38.940 --> 08:42.840
Firstly, we are combining ten and 20 and then we are going 30 and 31.

08:44.460 --> 08:45.090
I think.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.910
1800, but it should be 190.

08:52.590 --> 08:52.970
Okay.

09:01.550 --> 09:01.910
So what?

09:04.290 --> 09:05.310
I've taken the input.

09:05.340 --> 09:06.390
The input is correct.

09:07.370 --> 09:08.240
And it's correct.

09:08.390 --> 09:09.190
But if some.

09:11.170 --> 09:12.670
Calculations should be correct.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.000
Let me check previous some calculation.

09:20.270 --> 09:23.270
1036 6008.

09:24.670 --> 09:26.110
And all of this, folks.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.530
What I'm doing is I'm fighting.

09:33.200 --> 09:33.680
Okay.

09:33.830 --> 09:34.380
Okay.

09:34.400 --> 09:34.880
Okay.

09:34.910 --> 09:35.360
Sorry.

09:35.720 --> 09:36.200
My word.

09:39.110 --> 09:41.600
I'm thinking minimum and I in this late answer to be zero.

09:42.240 --> 09:42.730
What, what?

09:42.790 --> 09:44.420
What what's happening here, guys?

09:44.810 --> 09:47.030
The answer is zero for all the cases.

09:47.300 --> 09:52.730
And when this is the final, Eddie, when I'm making the last card, then what is the sum?

09:52.730 --> 09:53.370
From what?

09:54.900 --> 09:56.800
What are some parallels to what went into the final good?

09:57.770 --> 09:58.730
02n minus one.

09:59.660 --> 10:01.910
It is zero eight, so it is one.

10:02.180 --> 10:06.440
So therefore I'm getting a hundred in and it again, they two answers should not be zero.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.910
It should be some bigger value.

10:09.310 --> 10:13.660
Yeah ended about nine in the phone and it gives me around ended about well let's take one year.

10:13.960 --> 10:14.800
No problem with it.

10:15.810 --> 10:16.100
Well.

10:19.770 --> 10:21.490
And I know we were wondering, did I?

10:21.820 --> 10:23.230
Because I usually do.

10:23.230 --> 10:27.650
Guys are too busy, you know, because I took Maximilian, but then I changed maximum.

10:27.670 --> 10:30.430
But I did not change the default value of answer.

10:31.450 --> 10:32.120
Well, so.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.440
So that's what I was thinking.

10:34.450 --> 10:36.730
Do I need to be as kids when all is equal to are?

10:38.050 --> 10:38.830
Think about this.

10:40.280 --> 10:41.840
What if I don't use the base case?

10:43.990 --> 10:46.660
If I don't use a base case, then let's say that all is equal.

10:46.660 --> 10:47.020
Do I?

10:47.020 --> 10:48.160
This loop won't work.

10:48.610 --> 10:54.010
If this look won't work, that means in my answer I will be taking some premature rate.

10:54.010 --> 10:58.210
So that should not be considered hate supported.

10:58.210 --> 11:03.220
I can use a base case and if you don't want to use the base case, what you can do is inside this loop

11:03.220 --> 11:05.440
here, you can take the sum value.

11:07.880 --> 11:13.790
Right because of you know, the some is giving me some from 8 to 18 of one time only because already

11:13.790 --> 11:17.210
prefix calculation is right now if it is equal to r.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.170
That means.

11:19.550 --> 11:23.390
If let's let's see if L is equal to R in this function.

11:23.750 --> 11:29.420
So until 1118 grade this for a loop won't work and it really didn't move any 88.

11:29.570 --> 11:30.470
So is this correct?

11:31.760 --> 11:32.150
Yes.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.580
Eight because the edit would never be off.

11:36.580 --> 11:37.120
Land went.

11:38.150 --> 11:39.140
It is starting from two.

11:39.140 --> 11:44.910
But what if we reach the bases even at anywhere near 18 and that will be added to another one year?

11:45.800 --> 11:46.820
If that's the case.

11:46.820 --> 11:47.600
And are going to be.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.690
Something they hate.

11:51.020 --> 11:52.550
But we are getting very big values.

11:52.550 --> 11:53.900
That is when we're doing it right.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.660
What we can do is we have to have the best case.

11:57.810 --> 12:02.460
And Lisa goes to Oregon when suddenly ten zero because.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.610
And then what happens is later there are only two values remaining.

12:05.730 --> 12:10.020
Let's say ten in 2010 and 20, we have one get in middle of 1920.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.230
So when we have one good case, that means deep one.

12:13.230 --> 12:16.110
When it's called up to do is called, both of them are being combined.

12:16.590 --> 12:22.400
DB one one plus W2 plus some from under the eight, a deep one one.

12:22.810 --> 12:26.820
Leslie Trudeau should run me zero as the reason to get the wrong answer.

12:27.940 --> 12:28.190
Great.

12:29.050 --> 12:29.950
So good.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.670
No problem with this.

12:31.690 --> 12:36.400
And now what we can see is that what is the total complexity of this brute force solution?

12:36.400 --> 12:37.840
That it is brute force, nothing else.

12:39.190 --> 12:41.380
So what we have, we have a linear.

12:41.380 --> 12:44.070
So this is n squared and square state, so possible.

12:44.080 --> 12:49.000
But for all this huge world we have, we have a loop from actual which can be often in the worst case

12:49.630 --> 12:53.320
eight, which is considering all the codes we are making.

12:53.590 --> 12:54.550
What is this?

12:54.820 --> 12:56.830
Every good means that this is one particular section.

12:56.830 --> 12:58.120
This is one under subsection.

12:59.190 --> 13:00.480
The section as it don't answer.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.850
This has an own answer and then we are combining it.

13:03.330 --> 13:08.280
So they always remember this one line that I'm going to repeat the tank.

13:11.590 --> 13:18.910
The one thing that I'm combining ten and 21st think if I'm combining them with the rest of the distributor

13:18.910 --> 13:22.150
toward the end and how will we form the answer?

13:22.870 --> 13:24.610
I'm just going in the opposite order.

13:25.210 --> 13:31.060
Just remember this, that we if if this garden is for the end part and not the first part eight I'm

13:31.060 --> 13:31.690
making this card.

13:31.690 --> 13:37.180
It doesn't mean I'm combining ten and 20 and combining ten with the answer for this whole array.

13:38.140 --> 13:38.400
Eight.

13:38.530 --> 13:44.500
So I'm just moving in the opposite order, not in the order in which he has asked me to.

13:45.650 --> 13:49.640
Well, this thing that if I'm doing if I'm doing this operation at the end.

13:50.880 --> 13:55.140
Eight late because then there will be two values only, and then one value will be made.

13:55.530 --> 13:55.770
What?

13:55.770 --> 13:56.790
Those two values, guys?

13:57.770 --> 13:59.770
There will be three values only in the end.

13:59.780 --> 14:03.230
And then one of those really should be combined with those two values.

14:04.890 --> 14:12.070
Well, maybe you have an IQ solution, but of course, here will have many overlapping problems in the

14:12.150 --> 14:12.810
reading states.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.120
So what we can do is we can memorize it.

14:16.110 --> 14:17.340
Let's memorize it.

14:18.120 --> 14:18.380
Right.

14:18.390 --> 14:19.650
And grows and grows and grows.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.520
And states are there.

14:20.820 --> 14:26.220
Of course, these are calculations for Wolf and for all those states which will give me or even give

14:26.220 --> 14:27.560
solution eight.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.660
So let's memorize it quickly.

14:33.170 --> 14:33.860
Memo.

14:35.880 --> 14:41.010
And odd the answer not equal to 2018.

14:41.310 --> 14:43.170
A big value added in answer.

14:44.510 --> 14:44.800
Well.

14:45.290 --> 14:47.270
Otherwise he'll go here.

14:48.380 --> 14:49.940
And do the part.

14:49.970 --> 14:50.350
Okay.

14:51.180 --> 14:51.630
And.

14:54.290 --> 14:54.640
Can.

14:54.790 --> 14:55.780
Can it be negative?

14:56.150 --> 14:57.490
Can it be negative?

14:57.520 --> 15:00.250
No, because we are always learning and they are all positives.

15:01.330 --> 15:04.000
So instead of an idealistic minus one.

15:05.850 --> 15:07.570
Because again, I'm sitting by minus one.

15:10.220 --> 15:13.760
Memo sent a memo minus one.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.660
Base of.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.990
Well, if not, they didn't answer otherwise.

15:21.990 --> 15:22.350
This.

15:24.860 --> 15:25.340
Ma'am.

15:31.150 --> 15:33.040
I'm getting my innocence and that's a mistake.

15:34.390 --> 15:35.520
Nobody goes to minus one.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.250
Didn't answer.

15:41.820 --> 15:42.840
What did I do wrong?

15:43.500 --> 15:46.440
Mama said Mama's minus one side of mama.

15:46.590 --> 15:46.980
Great.

15:47.850 --> 15:48.740
And what is this?

15:49.310 --> 15:49.670
Okay.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.380
Let's do one thing.

15:51.380 --> 15:54.050
Let's leave Mahmoud with zero.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.230
I'm not getting very drunk.

16:03.340 --> 16:04.690
I'm doing something wrong, I guess.

16:07.550 --> 16:07.910
Okay.

16:09.780 --> 16:12.360
The answer is it goes to memory a lot and.

16:13.270 --> 16:16.600
And then I will be from the roof.

16:17.080 --> 16:17.920
The only.

16:23.830 --> 16:24.160
Okay.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.090
Answer, answer.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.830
It goes to this.

16:33.350 --> 16:33.770
Okay.

16:34.050 --> 16:34.490
Okay.

16:34.550 --> 16:34.810
Okay.

16:34.820 --> 16:35.930
Again, this is a mistake.

16:36.530 --> 16:38.570
I'm digging zero here, but.

16:41.450 --> 16:46.790
If it is a nautical to the rendered Indian, so otherwise it is equal to zero eight.

16:47.330 --> 16:49.190
Again, the same mistake here.

16:49.190 --> 16:51.950
Answer is it goes to zero and I'm doing the minimum thing.

16:52.610 --> 16:53.540
The first one were great.

16:53.870 --> 16:55.790
What I will do is I think was proven anything.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.970
Everything's right with something big party for that again.

17:00.210 --> 17:01.140
I did the same mistake.

17:02.040 --> 17:02.300
Well.

17:03.330 --> 17:05.190
The I was taking one year earlier.

17:05.820 --> 17:06.690
Ignore their dates.

17:08.960 --> 17:09.950
Only a little second.

17:09.950 --> 17:11.750
So that's why it might be happening.

17:12.860 --> 17:13.100
Well.

17:16.690 --> 17:17.420
Mm hmm.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.440
So let's it on to.

17:24.300 --> 17:27.110
What I won't take for any other issues.

17:27.120 --> 17:30.570
I hope this works the way that I study will break.

17:34.090 --> 17:34.350
Yeah.

17:34.360 --> 17:34.770
It worked.

17:34.960 --> 17:35.950
Seven milliseconds.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.710
Complexity and square are the.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.540
It's an orphan.

17:42.350 --> 17:43.660
Look and say so.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.810
This takes so much time.

17:46.220 --> 17:51.650
If if you were calculating sum again in a game from A to Z, then it would have become and ended about

17:51.650 --> 17:57.690
for solution so that to calculate the sum we need to fix them so that this returns me the value no over

17:57.700 --> 17:57.980
thing.

17:59.120 --> 17:59.360
Well.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.660
So thank you guys in the next tutorial.
