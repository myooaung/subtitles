00:00.950 --> 00:01.610
Hi, everyone.

00:01.820 --> 00:03.170
Let's call this problem.

00:03.770 --> 00:08.030
And we have already seen the base cases, which is simple.

00:08.140 --> 00:11.510
If I go to you, that means above zero go.

00:11.780 --> 00:12.710
It should be zero.

00:13.220 --> 00:13.690
And.

00:15.370 --> 00:16.960
This is a this case.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.920
We maintain that and this is the reconciliation we want to.

00:21.730 --> 00:26.710
So for any said, we want the previous sets, previous day value to be calculated.

00:27.310 --> 00:28.810
And I said below it, I.

00:30.820 --> 00:34.480
So this is my input set up.

00:34.930 --> 00:37.630
So I have given the number of products and the number of days.

00:37.630 --> 00:38.620
These are the inputs.

00:39.820 --> 00:40.080
Yeah.

00:40.390 --> 00:42.010
And this is prices that.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.200
Okay, let me quickly take them.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.280
Take it as an input.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.090
So I goes from zero to pay for all the products and for all their days.

00:51.100 --> 00:52.470
I just want to find out.

00:52.710 --> 00:55.590
I just want what is the price of the product?

00:55.860 --> 00:56.160
Correct.

00:57.660 --> 00:59.310
So initially they're going to repeat it.

00:59.310 --> 01:03.540
And I have initialized it with a very big value, which is veneered because we'll be taking minimums.

01:04.020 --> 01:04.320
Right.

01:04.650 --> 01:09.030
So if I'm taking measurements, I just initiated something very big so that it doesn't affect my answer.

01:09.570 --> 01:09.810
Eight.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.490
Now let's make base cases.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.620
So what are the base cases we have?

01:14.550 --> 01:18.200
Yeah, this one above zero comma.

01:18.220 --> 01:18.450
Any.

01:18.450 --> 01:19.200
It should be zero.

01:19.200 --> 01:19.560
Right.

01:19.980 --> 01:25.870
So let's just make this case which is know zero zero and let's market zero eight.

01:26.010 --> 01:27.000
Why am I doing this?

01:27.000 --> 01:27.540
Because.

01:29.470 --> 01:33.790
You will see in the reconciliation we have this correct.

01:33.850 --> 01:39.520
That is f of se commonly depends on f of s t minus one.

01:39.850 --> 01:46.750
So if amount f of 000, then F of zero one will also be zero because that's what I have.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.250
That's what I depend on.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.760
Because F of zero zero depends on 007.

01:52.540 --> 01:52.900
Correct.

01:53.050 --> 01:55.140
So they're just marked 000.

01:55.150 --> 01:58.000
And let's mark all the other basic cases.

01:58.390 --> 02:00.010
What are the other base cases?

02:00.040 --> 02:00.490
This.

02:01.970 --> 02:05.360
340 zero today and for just one drawn out.

02:05.420 --> 02:10.110
If I'm just buying one product on zero today, what is the value that I have?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.560
What is the price value that I like?

02:11.600 --> 02:11.960
Right.

02:12.350 --> 02:18.710
So I go for all the products and for the zero that they elaborated for the zero, it should be nothing,

02:18.710 --> 02:25.940
but it should be equal to the price of that particular product on the zero, because on 03i can buy

02:25.970 --> 02:26.900
only one product.

02:27.860 --> 02:28.820
Any one of the products.

02:29.210 --> 02:31.700
So what are the most values for it?

02:32.930 --> 02:36.050
So here you can see I've taken the role as must rage.

02:36.050 --> 02:39.140
I have to race to the power game as if I had these many products.

02:39.890 --> 02:41.350
What will the mask value of it?

02:41.360 --> 02:42.350
You guess it.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.450
Why don't you just try it yourself?

02:45.960 --> 02:51.210
If I'm just fine buying a diet verdict on zero three, what is the mosque value of their product?

02:51.450 --> 02:53.400
It will be nothing but one letter of type.

02:54.150 --> 02:57.120
It means only the eight will be settled in the mosque.

02:57.970 --> 02:58.390
Correct.

02:59.840 --> 03:00.110
Yeah.

03:00.480 --> 03:00.860
Now.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.260
Let's run a double for loop.

03:04.410 --> 03:06.420
So I'm doing this in a bottom up code.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.560
I'm just using tabulate tabulation for it.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.480
I just leave the memorization part of it to you.

03:13.230 --> 03:14.370
So, yeah.

03:14.620 --> 03:17.670
Now let's move ahead and let's figure out figure this thing out.

03:17.860 --> 03:20.670
But for any comedy, for any mosque.

03:22.180 --> 03:28.180
For any mask, comedy, whatever it is, I want mosque comedy minus one.

03:28.180 --> 03:29.590
That means this.

03:29.740 --> 03:30.430
I have to move.

03:30.430 --> 03:33.580
I have to do it over this base loop in increasing order.

03:34.740 --> 03:35.020
Right.

03:35.190 --> 03:39.360
So let's say they start from one, because for the zygote they have already filled the values.

03:39.930 --> 03:40.250
Cool.

03:40.590 --> 03:42.110
So they start from one.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.160
They will go to less than N and.

03:45.430 --> 03:46.690
Let's also have musk.

03:47.230 --> 03:47.530
Right.

03:47.680 --> 03:54.280
So mass it starts from zero because I the values for all the musk and must be voted one shift for all

03:54.280 --> 03:55.750
the values of correct.

03:55.990 --> 04:01.000
So for any musk any musk comedy combination I want do minus one got combination.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.110
That would have been a really great idea and I want something which is less than Musk then that would

04:08.110 --> 04:11.190
also have been calculated because I'm moving forward fully.

04:11.890 --> 04:12.880
So, yeah.

04:13.600 --> 04:18.880
Now what does the ATP Mask Command B means?

04:20.190 --> 04:23.490
But this particular subset of products, what is the minimum price need?

04:23.820 --> 04:25.990
So let's write the first case here.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.280
This one that is epi mask.

04:30.340 --> 04:32.080
And B is nothing.

04:32.110 --> 04:35.560
But it is also equal to the B mask.

04:35.560 --> 04:39.070
If I'm not buying the word on the current rate.

04:39.220 --> 04:41.200
So it is equal to must be minus.

04:41.530 --> 04:42.580
This is the first part of it.

04:42.880 --> 04:50.290
Right now, the second part of it is let's remove one, one element from the set, from the mask, basically.

04:50.980 --> 04:54.310
So if mask is 111, I will have to try 011.

04:54.310 --> 04:57.700
I will have to drive 101 and I'll have to try 110.

04:57.700 --> 05:00.100
I have to do all these three combinations, right?

05:00.340 --> 05:06.370
So let's iterate over, let's call it X because we have taken this as an X over here.

05:06.550 --> 05:06.870
Correct.

05:09.090 --> 05:10.170
So yeah.

05:10.530 --> 05:13.770
So I would say for all the products actually go for all the products.

05:13.770 --> 05:19.920
So as X starts from zero excuse three key for all the products and it will just check if Musk contains

05:19.920 --> 05:20.880
that product or not.

05:21.030 --> 05:21.330
Right?

05:21.630 --> 05:27.810
So if mask right shift x and one, that means mask contains the product, that means if the extra bit

05:27.810 --> 05:30.840
of mask is said, mask contains that product, right?

05:31.050 --> 05:33.750
So if mask contains, then what will be the new mask?

05:33.750 --> 05:42.120
Then this mask will depend on if mask is seven, it will depend on this three, five and six current.

05:42.270 --> 05:42.540
So.

05:42.740 --> 05:44.280
So how we like it this new mask.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.470
New mask will be just simple.

05:47.490 --> 05:51.240
My onset get rid of mask.

05:52.110 --> 05:52.350
Right.

05:52.770 --> 05:57.180
So if I uncertainty did a off mask I get the new mask from which I want the answer.

05:57.810 --> 05:58.590
That is this one.

05:59.580 --> 06:00.210
This part.

06:01.140 --> 06:01.470
Correct.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.590
So how do they get rid of any number?

06:04.950 --> 06:06.180
We know how to insert.

06:06.190 --> 06:11.970
And I also gave it to you as a homework, if I remember correctly.

06:12.450 --> 06:18.000
So what we can do is, let's say if this is the number and I want to answer this particular bit.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.490
So what I do is nothing but very simple.

06:21.500 --> 06:26.510
I'll take another number, which is zero zero in all the places and one on this place, and I'll take.

06:27.170 --> 06:34.370
Zorro offered Zorro to do so, though it is very simple thing that if both the values are same, it

06:34.370 --> 06:35.030
will be zero.

06:35.330 --> 06:37.160
Otherwise, if both the values are different.

06:38.130 --> 06:39.870
Then it will be one eight.

06:39.990 --> 06:46.650
So wherever their number had one, it will have in the resultant, wherever that had it had zero, it

06:46.650 --> 06:47.970
will have in the resultant.

06:48.210 --> 06:49.710
Just one small change will be there.

06:49.710 --> 06:53.040
That means the I it's the bit that I want to unset.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.080
It will be unsafe to put.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.690
So the new mask is nothing but mask.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.210
The other one left your pants.

07:00.600 --> 07:04.350
So I have left you after that product X for that particular product.

07:04.350 --> 07:08.310
I just want to check whether it is set or not.

07:08.310 --> 07:08.550
Right.

07:09.030 --> 07:12.180
So I want to answer to obtain the new mask.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.450
So now what will be the value of the B mask comma?

07:16.530 --> 07:23.460
The rate for this current bit, it will be a minimum of if we must go to whatever the minimum value

07:23.460 --> 07:24.450
was already there.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.530
And yet let me.

07:30.590 --> 07:33.930
And the we have got a new math.

07:33.950 --> 07:34.160
Great.

07:34.160 --> 07:37.390
That means that I'm just trying to apply this recursive relation.

07:37.430 --> 07:39.380
This one, the.

07:39.890 --> 07:40.610
The mask.

07:40.610 --> 07:42.530
The new mask and the minus one.

07:43.010 --> 07:44.000
So let me write it.

07:44.240 --> 07:54.620
The new mask and B minus one plus prices the price on the current day of the next product.

07:55.130 --> 07:56.930
That's what we discussed fully.

07:57.800 --> 08:03.370
So this is normally we with mask and simply I just in the end of it is my final answer.

08:03.380 --> 08:04.610
We discussed this also.

08:04.660 --> 08:05.960
Then the final answer is nothing.

08:05.960 --> 08:09.320
But then all the products we have to buy all the products at least once.

08:10.340 --> 08:12.680
And let's check the answer for all.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.140
The end minus one is right.

08:14.330 --> 08:15.350
So it will be one left.

08:15.570 --> 08:15.760
Okay.

08:15.770 --> 08:16.490
Minus one.

08:18.180 --> 08:24.840
Because this is the mask that will contain all the products that will have all to protect and the days

08:24.840 --> 08:26.190
end minus one, correct?

08:26.760 --> 08:28.710
It's related to if I have any errors.

08:28.710 --> 08:29.310
No errors.

08:29.310 --> 08:30.990
And here you can see we have good faith.

08:32.100 --> 08:32.440
Correct.

08:33.210 --> 08:36.840
So I hope this is making sense.

08:36.840 --> 08:40.220
And this is it looks complicated if you see it this way.

08:40.230 --> 08:46.220
But if you dive deeper, if you try to understand it, it's very easy, like very, very light.

08:46.440 --> 08:50.730
So a Baltimore bird living with bird mascot is always a little tricky.

08:50.730 --> 08:56.760
You can always try to go exemplars, memories, solution, but I always wanted to explain you this particular

08:57.750 --> 08:59.360
tabulation method as well.

08:59.460 --> 08:59.790
They.

09:00.980 --> 09:06.740
So we can see that five is the minimum value for all the products for the end.
