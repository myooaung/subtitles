WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:02.100
And everyone, welcome back.

00:02.400 --> 00:04.770
And this is the problem of default.

00:04.770 --> 00:06.270
The problem of default.

00:06.270 --> 00:08.460
The problem I was talking about and.

00:09.660 --> 00:10.460
So yeah.

00:10.470 --> 00:15.910
So the difference you can see here, it's very simple that it's now a three crossing board, not just

00:15.930 --> 00:16.800
to cross on board.

00:17.340 --> 00:20.790
So here we have a three crossing board and the targets are to cross one only.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.010
I can apply it horizontally or vertically.

00:23.010 --> 00:27.750
And I have to tell you, tell the number of ways in which I can feel this, this problem with them through

00:27.750 --> 00:29.640
tile from spot and.

00:31.140 --> 00:31.410
Yeah.

00:31.900 --> 00:35.520
You can go on spot and try this problem.

00:35.530 --> 00:36.420
You can understand it.

00:36.840 --> 00:43.440
It just says in how many ways can you dielectric cross in rectangle with two crosswind dominoes the

00:43.440 --> 00:45.230
same rate through the same building.

00:45.270 --> 00:49.590
So this a simple telling and so input consist of okay whatever.

00:49.830 --> 00:52.350
In with minus one, the input will end.

00:53.260 --> 00:55.410
But each desk is a longer training indeed.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.400
From 0 to 30, Google for each.

00:57.980 --> 00:58.210
Okay.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.470
These are not the solution by using bitmaps.

01:02.470 --> 01:07.210
But of course when we're not using it and we will see how can we all using sequences.

01:07.630 --> 01:09.100
Right and see the approach.

01:09.760 --> 01:13.150
I've already discussed the approach with you in the previous video.

01:13.150 --> 01:13.450
Right.

01:13.480 --> 01:16.720
It's always about filling the first column and finding our director in solution.

01:17.150 --> 01:18.310
We'll see how to do that.

01:18.310 --> 01:22.660
And we will call this and some readers will say, let's go back.

01:23.920 --> 01:24.240
Good.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.080
I hope everything is fine.

01:28.890 --> 01:35.820
Look, it started with a women you always start with if indeed happen is what a number of ways in which

01:36.060 --> 01:38.070
she grows and can be what can be told?

01:39.950 --> 01:45.890
Made the decision that we want to find out the let me get venue.

01:48.130 --> 01:50.360
What is the first movie in which I can fill this column?

01:50.630 --> 01:54.860
A folder in which I can fill this column is by having one tile.

01:56.090 --> 01:56.750
Like this.

01:58.790 --> 02:00.290
Up vertically.

02:00.290 --> 02:04.580
And the second time like this, you guys.

02:05.820 --> 02:08.640
You don't have to fill the second column completely.

02:08.910 --> 02:09.910
What do we want to do?

02:09.930 --> 02:13.320
We always want to fill the first column completely.

02:13.650 --> 02:17.490
If by filling the first column completely, the second column itself gets filled.

02:17.880 --> 02:21.900
For example, let's say I placed three tiles like horizontally.

02:22.410 --> 02:26.940
In this first column is also filled, but the second column itself gets four.

02:27.150 --> 02:28.350
And we don't have to worry about it.

02:28.890 --> 02:30.240
We just have to think.

02:32.130 --> 02:34.140
We just have to fill the first column.

02:35.490 --> 02:37.770
The one variable in the second column, it gets it gets four.

02:38.190 --> 02:39.060
It doesn't matter.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.740
But this is one way right now what we can see.

02:42.740 --> 02:44.780
What's the shape that I'm getting over here?

02:44.840 --> 02:47.680
The shape that I'm getting over here is a.

02:48.940 --> 02:50.650
Across board with two extra days.

02:51.290 --> 02:52.750
So I'm not feeling this to days.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.060
As I said, I'm not worried about the second column.

02:55.810 --> 02:56.860
So let's call Diane.

02:58.030 --> 02:59.050
Diane is nothing but.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.310
The cross and board.

03:03.370 --> 03:03.700
With.

03:04.930 --> 03:07.980
But it is, of course, a number of ways of healing, regrowth and bold with.

03:08.910 --> 03:10.770
Two extra.

03:16.400 --> 03:16.710
Buddy.

03:17.540 --> 03:20.180
Two extra squares on top.

03:20.720 --> 03:26.420
Let me write this as it's on top of what you have in here.

03:26.510 --> 03:29.360
So this is the first case of filling the first column, and F in here will be.

03:31.030 --> 03:31.420
Gene.

03:33.550 --> 03:36.730
Late or the second approach of filling the first column.

03:36.730 --> 03:40.240
It is just the reverse approach of this, which is fill one to cross.

03:41.140 --> 03:43.550
For Intel vertically and one horizontally.

03:44.150 --> 03:44.480
Eight.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.570
So in this way, it is nothing.

03:47.570 --> 03:49.190
But it gives me the third.

03:50.400 --> 03:55.170
Which is edging at the end, is nothing but a number of ways in which three urethane board is filled

03:55.170 --> 03:58.920
with two extra wires on bottom.

03:59.460 --> 03:59.690
Right?

03:59.700 --> 04:02.940
Basically now we can see the extra squares on the bottom.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.690
This is a three growth input and two extra squares on the bottom.

04:07.870 --> 04:08.290
I hope.

04:10.070 --> 04:10.450
Uh.

04:10.790 --> 04:11.030
Yeah.

04:11.270 --> 04:15.960
So this one thing I think I missed, and that is it is not an eight.

04:16.250 --> 04:16.490
Yeah.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.780
Let me go back to it again.

04:19.060 --> 04:21.280
So the first case was this.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.790
And we had.

04:29.290 --> 04:32.880
This was the first case I remember in this.

04:32.890 --> 04:34.390
If this is effin.

04:35.820 --> 04:36.900
If this is a fan.

04:37.730 --> 04:39.080
Then this will be.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.370
Jian minus two.

04:41.390 --> 04:43.190
Not Jian 834.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.370
This is Jian minus two.

04:45.380 --> 04:47.120
Actually, I'm very excited for this problem.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.220
Yeah, this is n minus two.

04:49.220 --> 04:51.050
Rate this this landed and minus two.

04:51.230 --> 04:54.450
Similarly, this is Jian minus two with two extra quiescent.

04:55.930 --> 04:56.170
Well.

04:57.700 --> 05:03.730
And similarly, the other case in which I am placing one here and one here.

05:05.270 --> 05:07.550
There it is again, minus two.

05:07.820 --> 05:12.500
Of course, we know people inside DNA as it goes to a chamber will replace it later.

05:12.740 --> 05:16.930
Right now we are just making guesses or the turkeys, geese, turkeys can be if they.

05:19.340 --> 05:20.150
Blizzard like this.

05:20.360 --> 05:24.920
I mean, one day let me this is one title.

05:24.920 --> 05:25.910
This is second title.

05:25.910 --> 05:28.820
And this is starting in this way and filling the first column.

05:29.060 --> 05:31.070
The second is getting really doesn't matter.

05:31.120 --> 05:35.630
I'm just worried about first column and delegate plus.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.380
This is even minus two at eight F and minus two.

05:40.610 --> 05:44.570
I hope all the rigorous cases are very clear to each and every one of us.

05:45.530 --> 05:45.800
Right.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.060
So this was the third case.

05:47.060 --> 05:48.410
And this is their friend minus.

05:50.690 --> 05:52.200
Now, guys, let's find out.

05:52.220 --> 05:52.650
Jian.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.810
So that's what we did in the previous example as well.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.110
We were not worried.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.640
Now we are worried about Jian.

05:58.970 --> 05:59.180
It's.

05:59.180 --> 05:59.840
Copy this.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.240
Let me paste it.

06:03.330 --> 06:03.510
Right.

06:03.860 --> 06:04.770
Let's try and find out.

06:04.790 --> 06:05.440
Jean, look.

06:05.910 --> 06:06.220
How.

06:06.250 --> 06:07.410
How does this look like?

06:08.100 --> 06:10.200
It's not gion.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.150
It's gion and of.

06:13.540 --> 06:13.780
Yeah.

06:13.960 --> 06:18.460
So what was Indian was country growth and what were two extra squares on top?

06:18.460 --> 06:18.730
Right.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.980
Basically it is this.

06:32.980 --> 06:33.250
Yeah.

06:33.340 --> 06:41.320
This is a rigorous and good decision for me with two extra squares over here on top made this two extra

06:41.320 --> 06:42.040
squares on top.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.000
Let's see.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.910
How can we figure out, you know.

06:46.110 --> 06:48.480
Like Meridian the energy goes to.

06:49.230 --> 06:50.400
Okay, let's find this.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.950
The first way will be to.

06:52.950 --> 06:53.550
Please.

06:53.910 --> 06:54.690
Of course I have to.

06:54.690 --> 06:56.160
I want to fill this first column.

06:56.520 --> 06:57.930
It's what I'm always doing.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.450
This fill the first first column on first base.

07:00.450 --> 07:06.630
Simply press one will vertically displace one tile vertically, and the first column will be four eight,

07:06.990 --> 07:08.100
which is a two crosswind date.

07:09.170 --> 07:11.210
So if this is the end, then what is this?

07:12.680 --> 07:14.750
And which is effin nature.

07:14.760 --> 07:15.470
This is different.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.750
This feeling just totally gross and bored.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.870
If this is fine, let me simply write it.

07:20.960 --> 07:26.300
G n is nothing but f and plus what are different ways, other way of filling it?

07:27.920 --> 07:30.950
The other way can be by placing two tiles horizontally.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.780
I just have to fill the first column.

07:33.860 --> 07:36.590
This is one way and this is picking.

07:37.670 --> 07:38.120
Let me.

07:39.070 --> 07:39.970
With a different color.

07:41.730 --> 07:45.780
So I placed two -- only in this vehicle to the first column get completely full.

07:46.170 --> 07:52.140
As I said, this one is not a part of the problem right now because I'm trying to find Jian, which

07:52.140 --> 07:52.350
is.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.330
Which is two extra squares on the top.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.120
This is not in.

07:56.760 --> 07:57.120
Okay.

07:57.630 --> 07:58.890
Give me something black.

08:00.260 --> 08:00.890
Let me try.

08:01.100 --> 08:01.370
Black.

08:02.240 --> 08:02.840
Yeah, it's.

08:06.410 --> 08:06.560
Yeah.

08:07.100 --> 08:11.400
Well, this is what I'm worried about right now, which is something you.

08:11.450 --> 08:12.620
GROSS In which to access.

08:12.620 --> 08:14.660
QUESTION Like we did in the previous video.

08:16.380 --> 08:16.640
Well.

08:18.270 --> 08:22.680
So if I fill it this way now, what I can say is I have a new ship, Verizon new ship.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.260
It is some B cross and board.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.010
I'd be cross and bold.

08:30.460 --> 08:31.210
Basically it's not.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.430
And I know it isn't minus one.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.910
We're just seeing your growth and.

08:33.910 --> 08:34.870
But with one.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.870
Squire down to now.

08:37.870 --> 08:43.450
You can see I had a friend which is regrowth in giant regrowth and we're two weeks quite on top and

08:43.450 --> 08:45.490
didn't lose quite on bottom.

08:46.060 --> 08:49.330
But do I have one square on top or one square in bottom?

08:49.690 --> 08:55.560
NARRATOR Let's make another, which is iron, which isn't a thing, but a number of ways of making t

08:55.570 --> 08:56.170
cross in.

08:57.340 --> 09:00.220
With one extra square on top.

09:02.320 --> 09:06.060
They are basically, let's say, on the bottom here, we can see bottom right.

09:06.070 --> 09:08.500
We can visualize bottom right now in the example.

09:09.470 --> 09:10.580
Look, this is bottom.

09:11.690 --> 09:12.980
This is one on the bottom, right?

09:13.280 --> 09:16.490
And if this is end, then what does this become?

09:16.490 --> 09:18.330
It becomes I and minus one.

09:18.800 --> 09:19.760
I hope this is very clear.

09:20.870 --> 09:22.310
This part is in minus one.

09:22.910 --> 09:23.390
Which part?

09:23.570 --> 09:24.080
This part.

09:25.530 --> 09:28.230
This with this one extra squared here.

09:28.590 --> 09:34.860
H So this is n minus one length, it becomes eight and minus one with one extra column with one axis

09:34.860 --> 09:35.250
squared.

09:36.180 --> 09:38.250
All right, now let's find out.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.930
I mean, it's fun, but don't worry.

09:39.930 --> 09:41.130
It's a very interesting problem.

09:41.580 --> 09:42.450
And of course.

09:43.430 --> 09:44.200
It's not tough.

09:44.210 --> 09:46.370
It's just a little, little extra.

09:46.700 --> 09:48.290
I have some extra stewards over here.

09:49.430 --> 09:51.470
This is Gene with one.

09:52.160 --> 09:52.900
Now let's find out.

09:52.910 --> 09:54.470
I n so how do I find out?

09:56.990 --> 09:58.400
Well, let me copy.

09:59.930 --> 10:00.290
It's.

10:01.240 --> 10:01.920
This year this.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.850
Let me copy this and let me quickly.

10:07.080 --> 10:07.920
We could black.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.640
Back this.

10:11.770 --> 10:12.610
And which is why.

10:12.610 --> 10:13.580
Next Monday, Mark.

10:16.560 --> 10:21.780
Ladies, this is the island and this land is in.

10:23.330 --> 10:23.620
Ready.

10:25.020 --> 10:25.890
This land is in.

10:29.240 --> 10:30.660
That's why it says I am.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.960
So how you how can I find I in this?

10:33.440 --> 10:35.270
I just have to fill the first column.

10:35.270 --> 10:39.080
I said I will always say one thing, just really first column.

10:39.440 --> 10:44.060
If I fill the first column, there's only one way in filling the first column, which is is to have

10:44.060 --> 10:45.320
a tile horizontally.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.640
Now, what does this become?

10:46.940 --> 10:52.790
This becomes nothing margin, which is extra squares and actually cross end would be two and is it goes

10:52.790 --> 10:54.950
to G off and minus one.

10:56.200 --> 10:56.500
Eight.

10:57.530 --> 10:58.820
Let me been.

10:59.970 --> 11:01.290
I intend to go through nothing but.

11:03.220 --> 11:03.830
Jane Wednesday.

11:04.180 --> 11:09.250
And because I have this figure which is G and what will be Iove and minus one.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.390
Are you afraid minus one will be equal to Jovan minus two.

11:13.570 --> 11:16.150
So I can simply replace here I'll find minus one.

11:16.480 --> 11:20.140
This will give me effin plus the n minus.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.980
So I have completely eliminated I from here.

11:22.990 --> 11:24.100
So this is my second.

11:25.040 --> 11:25.550
And.

11:27.140 --> 11:29.750
This is my first and also raising funds.

11:29.750 --> 11:35.690
What I can do is we know that your friend is equals to have your friend paid because it's it's kind

11:35.690 --> 11:37.130
of the mirror of the same thing.

11:37.370 --> 11:39.500
So I can simply replace it here by G.

11:41.150 --> 11:42.170
Yeah, let me write it.

11:42.830 --> 11:49.310
This is it goes from nothing but F and minus two plus two into D and minus two because F in GRC.

11:50.410 --> 11:59.430
And what is g gs nothing but effin less i.e. minus i n minus one which is f and plus and minus two because

11:59.710 --> 12:06.040
it added I in terms of g only because there's only one case right now, let's call it.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.040
And then we'll summit it on spot.

12:10.400 --> 12:10.640
Well.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.330
Oh, yeah, me.

12:15.940 --> 12:16.240
Okay.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.250
So I think I have all yeah.

12:18.460 --> 12:19.690
I have already quoted it.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.700
I think I'll just show you the code then.

12:22.900 --> 12:24.490
So let's see the input.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.880
It will save my time and yours because there's nothing much to code in this.

12:28.300 --> 12:29.760
So it is simple to wait.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.900
Well, the answer is to eventually do two and three.

12:31.900 --> 12:35.050
One and minus one is the end of input.

12:36.010 --> 12:39.940
So I'm doing a C in N if I am getting N minus one and simply break the loop.

12:39.940 --> 12:41.170
Otherwise what I'm doing is.

12:42.110 --> 12:42.870
Initial it.

12:44.060 --> 12:46.820
And he says the finger is still in place.

12:46.820 --> 12:51.660
One pool and the second one is F of 0000 goes to one.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.920
You can try this via D one because.

12:54.980 --> 12:56.600
Okay, let's talk about the G0 case.

12:57.140 --> 13:02.630
What does G0 mean that zero grass and board with two extra squares on top.

13:02.960 --> 13:08.150
So if I have two extra squares on top, it can be filled by using one vertical domino.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.460
So that's why they are one the base case.

13:11.090 --> 13:15.290
This is the second base case which is zero F4 one is Giovanni goes to zero.

13:15.290 --> 13:16.640
Right, because let's see.

13:17.600 --> 13:23.540
If I ever went grocery would going to fill it and I fill this one grocery bill by trying to cross one

13:23.540 --> 13:23.800
day.

13:23.810 --> 13:28.580
I cannot wait because there will be a tile which will be half used.

13:29.000 --> 13:29.720
I cannot fill it.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.370
So f of one is zero.

13:31.760 --> 13:32.720
Morris G of one.

13:32.930 --> 13:33.830
The other one is nothing.

13:33.830 --> 13:42.650
But if I add extra D over there now again I can see that there are five places to be filled, five squares

13:42.650 --> 13:43.370
to be filled in.

13:43.520 --> 13:47.750
But I cannot will all five squares because you cross Venice.

13:49.340 --> 13:51.860
Anita Grossman I will only use two squares to fill.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.550
So again, the same problem.

13:53.570 --> 13:55.580
There will be one square that will be left over.

13:55.910 --> 13:56.810
Like in Northfield.

13:57.020 --> 13:58.720
Everyone was different.

13:58.730 --> 14:00.380
So that's why the number of it is zero.

14:00.660 --> 14:05.720
It does a base case and this is our recursive approach that we have already formed.

14:06.170 --> 14:12.590
Eight So what was the approach the D.A. request to F in plus the n minus to the g n is equal to.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.380
Evan Lesbian minus.

14:16.550 --> 14:17.130
Very simple.

14:17.180 --> 14:18.950
So just remember this.

14:19.640 --> 14:28.490
If I'm calculating j and using if I that this guarantee that if I is already computed before 88 means

14:28.490 --> 14:33.570
I cannot do it like this because here I'm using f i various f I is not computing it.

14:33.740 --> 14:34.730
So because.

14:35.870 --> 14:37.130
Automakers, basically.

14:37.670 --> 14:42.540
And the second one was that if anything was to happen, minus two equals two.

14:42.540 --> 14:46.090
If in minus two plus two in Goodyear and minus two plus two in Daejeon.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.130
That is filling a void.

14:48.140 --> 14:49.040
This is getting bigger.

14:49.060 --> 14:54.190
And finally, I'm bringing a friend because the final answer for this effort, I build this.

14:55.190 --> 14:56.000
Now per negative.

14:56.020 --> 14:56.270
Three.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.530
One, two, two, one, three, one.

14:58.010 --> 14:59.600
It just seem right.

14:59.870 --> 15:02.390
And also I can come the solution.

15:02.390 --> 15:04.010
And I've already seen that it's working.

15:05.180 --> 15:06.640
So I already did it.

15:06.650 --> 15:08.210
Like to work.

15:08.630 --> 15:10.160
And I just quickly checked it.

15:11.820 --> 15:19.560
I hope this problem gives you some little insight on how can you solve some problems based on sequences

15:19.560 --> 15:20.850
and feeling.

15:20.850 --> 15:22.650
And so it's not an optimization problem.

15:22.990 --> 15:30.720
It asks you to find a number of ways in really a problem of equations, or we can say problem of a formula

15:30.720 --> 15:31.890
to this rate.

15:33.160 --> 15:33.850
Oh, yeah.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.930
But there's another problem, which is a follow up of this problem.

15:38.200 --> 15:44.620
And so we had tiling problem, then we're totally problem two and then three, then this and then we

15:44.620 --> 15:50.290
have a tiling problem and which is if follow problem of this problem, which is in this problem, it

15:50.290 --> 15:51.550
has only three growth and rate.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.980
But the another problem, it is also an proj.

15:54.220 --> 15:54.730
It has.

15:55.730 --> 15:57.110
We're crossing it.

15:58.140 --> 16:01.190
And so it's becoming complicated for growth.

16:01.190 --> 16:02.480
And how can you solve this?

16:03.770 --> 16:10.490
So I leave this task to you and I try and solve the photographs and problems so you can research this

16:10.490 --> 16:12.740
on Google and you'll learn on this parents page.

16:13.500 --> 16:13.860
I'm.

16:15.190 --> 16:17.000
Always remember, right?

16:17.440 --> 16:22.640
We could be straight when you and your tester try to fill the first column, then see what is the theory

16:22.660 --> 16:24.070
you are getting and.

16:25.550 --> 16:26.630
In the records of relations.

16:27.440 --> 16:34.220
Then in the end, they place the variables, try to minimize number of expenses you need.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.360
And then finally loop, loop it.

16:38.180 --> 16:39.710
Of course, this is a very long problem.

16:39.710 --> 16:40.160
I don't know.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.430
It might even be.

16:42.490 --> 16:48.520
It relies on maybe more aid because it has so much of different things going in it.

16:49.180 --> 16:55.300
So I am not going deep into this problem, but I'll leave it to you as a follow problem to solve it.

16:55.990 --> 16:56.320
Thanks.
