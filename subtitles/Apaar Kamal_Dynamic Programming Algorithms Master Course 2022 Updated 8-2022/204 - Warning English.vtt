00:00.700 --> 00:01.360
Everyone.

00:01.840 --> 00:04.450
So now we're reaching the end of the course.

00:04.900 --> 00:09.100
And here is educational, academic programming.

00:09.550 --> 00:11.680
It is that I have shared with you.

00:12.250 --> 00:13.540
What you can do is you can just.

00:14.740 --> 00:20.560
Well, if you have reached this part and you are all the problems yourself as well, then you can simply

00:21.100 --> 00:28.330
give dissection and just solve all those problems yourself whenever you face any problem in the problem.

00:28.660 --> 00:35.860
Then you can come back and see those lectures because those lectures were actually of those were actually

00:35.860 --> 00:37.300
a whole series in them since.

00:37.510 --> 00:44.710
So I have explained the concepts again in those lectures in the academic programming section.

00:45.790 --> 00:50.500
So it would be a waste of time if you go through each one and all of them.

00:51.010 --> 00:57.340
But what you can do is you can just try the problems yourself and then come back and see the good video.

00:57.340 --> 01:02.700
Maybe my code might be a little different from your code, and maybe you have got it in a bottom of

01:02.710 --> 01:05.110
manner recorded in the because of manner.

01:05.170 --> 01:05.470
Right.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.240
So just.

01:08.540 --> 01:08.790
Yeah.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.510
So just try those problems yourself.

01:10.520 --> 01:14.420
And just a small suggestion that I wanted to give you.

01:14.660 --> 01:19.760
And it's a slide warning that don't watch all these lectures which are down in this quarter.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.730
Dynamic Programming, Section eight.

01:22.730 --> 01:23.300
That's all.

01:23.390 --> 01:24.090
Thank you.

01:24.110 --> 01:25.400
I hope you enjoyed the course.
