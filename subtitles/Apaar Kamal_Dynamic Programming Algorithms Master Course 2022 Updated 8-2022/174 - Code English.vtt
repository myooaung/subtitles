00:00.540 --> 00:04.470
So let's try to go this logic and it's just one lines of code.

00:04.470 --> 00:07.650
So what I will do is, okay, let's do one thing.

00:07.740 --> 00:08.910
Let's take this example.

00:09.180 --> 00:12.240
Let's say I want to find out the sum of subsets of seven.

00:13.050 --> 00:13.440
Correct.

00:14.250 --> 00:17.430
Or let's add some more subsets, put all the values from 0 to 7.

00:17.850 --> 00:18.130
Right.

00:18.420 --> 00:20.670
And initially, what else is all this?

00:20.670 --> 00:24.040
It's five, one, two and so on.

00:24.060 --> 00:28.380
All seven, all four by one, two.

00:28.380 --> 00:31.740
And all these values, they all have value equal to one.

00:33.140 --> 00:34.340
Eight, so until seven.

00:34.880 --> 00:39.620
So if I'm going to say seven, it actually means that of 101 and two.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.970
Correct, because seven has all three values, all attributes said in it.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.680
But don't get confused in this eight.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.080
So let's go to this.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.220
So initially, let's see all the values.

00:51.790 --> 00:52.120
Okay.

00:53.940 --> 00:56.760
In and let the energy go through it.

00:56.760 --> 01:02.790
And we'll simply say that initially, let's say the values value of all the.

01:03.790 --> 01:04.450
Elements.

01:04.690 --> 01:04.870
Right.

01:04.930 --> 01:11.800
So how many elements and literally values of 1027, all of them contains the value one that means all

01:11.800 --> 01:17.590
these sets that zero represents a one represent or to represent all those over exactly one value.

01:17.590 --> 01:17.860
Right.

01:18.040 --> 01:24.380
And then what I want to do is I want to calculate the most subsets of what all these values from 0 to

01:24.380 --> 01:26.110
7 and what I should get.

01:26.140 --> 01:33.880
We all know if I'm trying to add the sum of subsets of what all the values from 0 to 7 will get, exactly

01:33.880 --> 01:36.430
the total number of subsets that these values contain.

01:36.880 --> 01:42.520
Eight, for example, we saw that's only contained doing two, two and two, two, which is it.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.820
Very so five should contain two into two, which is four.

01:46.510 --> 01:55.430
These are the values that should and in the end predict how many values they have such that, okay,

01:55.450 --> 02:00.220
in short, we can simply say this will also exercise and attainment in our case.

02:00.220 --> 02:05.050
In this case, when we are taking all the values to be equal to one, it is nothing but to raise to

02:05.050 --> 02:07.330
the power number of Edwards.

02:08.380 --> 02:08.740
Right.

02:09.410 --> 02:09.660
Right.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.440
Or it can also be equal to.

02:13.450 --> 02:14.200
The number of.

02:15.420 --> 02:16.680
J such an that.

02:19.070 --> 02:23.650
I.e. and g is equal to y is equal to G, correct?

02:25.300 --> 02:28.570
It means the community lines are tight and how many such subsidies are possible.

02:28.570 --> 02:32.920
And we already know how many of them impossible to reach our number of settlements, because that can

02:32.920 --> 02:34.300
come and that can not come.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.520
So let's call it quickly.

02:38.060 --> 02:42.140
So initially I filled all the values with one and it's.

02:43.160 --> 02:43.670
Move.

02:43.700 --> 02:44.540
Bit by bit.

02:48.650 --> 02:53.330
Let's move bit by bit and you know, still and it goes through, it will have only three words.

02:54.080 --> 03:00.470
So let's move over to a little bit or or let's do one other thing.

03:00.470 --> 03:01.160
Let's see.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.990
Let's represent A.B..

03:04.490 --> 03:05.560
Let's end this tribute.

03:05.570 --> 03:10.720
So if any tributes and it's a set of three, that means how many values do I need?

03:10.730 --> 03:11.450
I need one.

03:11.450 --> 03:15.950
Let shift in values to the power and values to represent all these bits.

03:16.940 --> 03:21.120
So let's represent and is the total number of bits instead.

03:21.290 --> 03:25.340
Total number of elements insert.

03:26.520 --> 03:26.740
Cool.

03:27.120 --> 03:33.810
And then what we'll do is what everybody what we'll try to do is we'll try to apply out of the Green's

03:33.840 --> 03:40.080
logic here, which is I think, okay, let's apply this thing in value itself only so that we don't

03:40.080 --> 03:40.500
have to create.

03:40.500 --> 03:45.060
And already we will simply say that value of g equals to value of.

03:47.770 --> 03:52.690
Some subset of the rate such that if I remove this bit from G, it gives me that subset.

03:52.690 --> 03:53.050
Correct.

03:53.350 --> 03:54.410
So how will I take this?

03:54.430 --> 03:57.880
Firstly, we need to check whether the bit is set in the or not.

03:58.480 --> 04:03.640
If the British said didn't do so bird rights if the directive Britain one that means.

04:04.850 --> 04:09.830
This has been said which brought this this --, this this bit.

04:10.670 --> 04:14.390
If they has Edward said, then we'll simply remove it from the.

04:15.830 --> 04:22.060
So let's remove that bit from the anvil, simply adding that this is not this is someone was upset but

04:22.070 --> 04:22.550
already.

04:23.520 --> 04:29.170
I'm always upset for all the values from zero to goodness to the poverty rate and this.

04:29.190 --> 04:29.540
Okay.

04:29.550 --> 04:30.870
So this day will go from.

04:32.510 --> 04:33.320
One lecture often.

04:34.260 --> 04:35.700
But all images, Rick.

04:36.030 --> 04:36.840
Let's print it.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.050
And then we will see the results.

04:50.890 --> 04:51.190
Okay.

04:51.340 --> 04:54.250
So here we can see that this is 101.

04:55.180 --> 05:01.720
To the tree as to which they said it is to restore the power to then for five weeks.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.810
And so it took basically we are just trying to figure out the values.

05:05.110 --> 05:08.890
Let's say we had some different values and it or let's see that.

05:10.090 --> 05:11.170
Value of a.

05:12.510 --> 05:14.950
Value of AI is equal to 88.

05:15.540 --> 05:16.120
That means.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.050
One will have a value of one.

05:19.050 --> 05:20.400
Two will have a value of two.

05:20.430 --> 05:21.810
Three will have a value of three.

05:21.810 --> 05:23.070
Four will have a value for ten.

05:23.070 --> 05:25.130
So until seven corrects.

05:25.260 --> 05:25.980
And it's true that.

05:28.140 --> 05:30.660
So I just use this function called Iota.

05:30.660 --> 05:33.950
If you've not heard about it, then it's a good time to hear about it.

05:35.190 --> 05:36.750
So this IHRA of what does it do?

05:36.960 --> 05:38.730
We pass the initial value to it.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.050
Let's end embossing zero to it.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.480
It will fail the first.

05:45.020 --> 05:48.770
First part or the first index of this value with zero.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.540
Second one will be the obvious one.

05:51.090 --> 05:53.450
Hey, so what if I start with five?

05:53.900 --> 05:55.220
The value of zero will be five.

05:55.230 --> 06:00.000
In this case, value of one will be six, value of two will be seven, and so on eight.

06:00.020 --> 06:00.920
So I'll start with zero.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.620
So net zero, get zero and let's have the sum.

06:05.830 --> 06:11.060
So here you can see that salmon is stranded by because 0 to 7 the total sum is 20.

06:11.110 --> 06:15.820
So basically zero to say when all the values lines inside the set of seven.

06:15.820 --> 06:16.070
Correct.

06:16.600 --> 06:21.970
If it lies inside this set of seven, therefore it will calculate the sum for all the values.

06:21.970 --> 06:26.140
And we know that all of them are right now the value of all is equal to it.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.590
So this is nothing where the value of I equals two.

06:30.370 --> 06:34.360
Similarly, for six, let's figure this out before six.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.640
I can have I can afford values.

06:36.640 --> 06:36.880
Eight.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.350
The six should be one.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.490
Like anyone can be one.

06:40.940 --> 06:49.640
Everyone can be Ford and the auto, it can be zero eight or it is zero plus four plus one plus six.

06:50.420 --> 06:50.840
Correct.

06:51.590 --> 06:52.340
What is this.

06:52.340 --> 06:53.390
X plus four plus one?

06:55.300 --> 06:56.940
0840.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.080
I have actually written the value zero there.

07:00.440 --> 07:00.710
Yep.

07:00.710 --> 07:01.070
Sorry.

07:01.250 --> 07:01.960
This is not sick.

07:01.970 --> 07:02.540
This is fake.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.660
So we have Phi Phi plus one plus four plus zero.

07:05.660 --> 07:06.620
So which is nothing but.

07:08.020 --> 07:08.400
Okay.

07:09.770 --> 07:11.570
Five plus four plus one is ten.

07:12.290 --> 07:15.350
So here you can see we have developed ten for five and for six.

07:15.350 --> 07:16.630
Let's forget about it for six.

07:16.860 --> 07:18.260
Oh, my word.

07:18.260 --> 07:20.990
I was just doing some calculations for six.

07:21.560 --> 07:22.250
Yeah, for six.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.270
We'll have four.

07:23.720 --> 07:24.800
We'll also have six.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.180
We'll also have.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.640
But I will also have.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.020
Six four or let's move that bit.

07:33.050 --> 07:34.220
I'll give you long term zero.

07:34.220 --> 07:35.960
And let's remember that we will have to.

07:36.230 --> 07:40.140
There it is, six plus four plus two, which is correct.

07:40.160 --> 07:47.180
So this is as simple as 58 and this is the only one line from laboratory SDP.

07:48.070 --> 07:48.760
This is a trick.

07:48.770 --> 07:52.280
Basically, this is a short trick and it's very tricky to get this trick.

07:53.540 --> 07:57.410
So let's see you in the next part will be solving problems to us to.
