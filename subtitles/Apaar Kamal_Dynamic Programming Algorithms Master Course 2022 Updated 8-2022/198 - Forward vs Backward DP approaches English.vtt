00:01.150 --> 00:01.780
Hello, everyone.

00:01.780 --> 00:02.710
Welcome to Spot.

00:03.460 --> 00:03.770
So.

00:04.650 --> 00:05.010
Here.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.110
I have this cool problem for you.

00:07.110 --> 00:14.730
And by solving this problem, by looking at our approach to it, and we'll realize that not all problems

00:15.450 --> 00:20.190
are solvable from bottom up approach as well as a top down approach.

00:21.060 --> 00:27.030
So basically the differences between backward and forward to be willing to stand by after solving this

00:27.030 --> 00:31.110
problem because okay, let's resolve this.

00:31.230 --> 00:34.410
It's worth trying to stand this problem and then we'll solve it also.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.840
And after that, we will see why we can't use both.

00:38.310 --> 00:40.500
So it will be a long lecture and.

00:42.490 --> 00:46.160
Firstly this page, and here you are.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.780
You have very classical and important problems of what?

00:48.810 --> 00:55.660
What would I suggested after you complete the course you had on the board to read or to the classical

00:55.660 --> 01:00.670
section, and then the dynamic programming hashtag just added there there's an option, and after that

01:00.670 --> 01:04.910
you will see all good classical programming problems in front of you, right?

01:05.230 --> 01:09.910
And after when you've been finished with the course and then you will read the problem statement from

01:09.910 --> 01:17.200
SPI, then you will correctly realize that this problem is from which part of D, b, and then you can

01:17.200 --> 01:18.060
easily apply, right?

01:18.070 --> 01:22.090
So we have seen lots of problems, optimization problem, combinatorial problems.

01:22.090 --> 01:27.760
When you do re multidimensional, these graphs mask s with lots of rate.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.490
So you can try all the problems in this.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.470
Yeah, let's move forward.

01:33.610 --> 01:36.160
It says, in my opinion, we have a very strange monetary system.

01:36.610 --> 01:39.580
Each gold coin has an ingredient and member on it.

01:39.850 --> 01:40.300
A coin.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.760
And can we exchange into a bang into three coins?

01:42.760 --> 01:44.440
And by doing by three and before.

01:45.040 --> 01:47.290
But these numbers are all rounded.

01:47.290 --> 01:47.590
Don't.

01:49.040 --> 01:49.430
Okay.

01:50.340 --> 01:51.900
The banks have to make a profit.

01:52.440 --> 01:58.920
You can also sell the coins for American dollars and the exchange rate is one ratio.

01:58.920 --> 02:03.690
And okay, basically what you cannot buy by lending gold coins.

02:03.870 --> 02:04.770
Okay, I can buy it.

02:05.190 --> 02:06.420
Do you have one gold going?

02:07.020 --> 02:10.080
And what is the maximum amount of American dollars you can get for it?

02:11.580 --> 02:11.840
Nice.

02:12.240 --> 02:15.950
Basically I have a gold coin and it has some number written on it.

02:15.960 --> 02:16.970
For example, 12.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.450
How many American dollars can I get for it and what other options that I have?

02:22.540 --> 02:25.390
A coin and can be exchanged in a bang into three coins.

02:25.390 --> 02:27.160
And by two and by three.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.210
And then by four.

02:29.020 --> 02:29.290
Eight.

02:29.560 --> 02:29.860
So.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.180
What example if I have this coin?

02:33.270 --> 02:35.580
Well, it can be exchanged into three coins.

02:35.730 --> 02:37.860
The first is and they do six.

02:38.550 --> 02:44.790
If I give him a 12 coin he can give me, he will give me a six coin and batteries for coin and my four

02:44.790 --> 02:46.380
is a three going eight.

02:46.380 --> 02:47.550
So what is six plus?

02:48.430 --> 02:48.670
Now.

02:48.670 --> 02:48.920
I have.

02:48.940 --> 02:49.240
Okay.

02:49.810 --> 02:50.140
It's.

02:51.150 --> 02:51.390
Yeah.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.320
Let's say you do.

02:53.070 --> 02:55.620
Let's ever tell dollars going 12.

02:56.910 --> 03:00.840
Reign of gold where I go to bang, I say, Give me and my two.

03:02.050 --> 03:03.030
You mean by three?

03:03.040 --> 03:04.290
Because I'm exchanging it date.

03:04.610 --> 03:06.400
Give me an before in place of it.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.860
What will I get from and why do I hear you?

03:08.860 --> 03:10.960
Give me a six goin then.

03:12.600 --> 03:18.120
From in my get a foregoing and from above where I look at a tree going right now, what I can do is

03:18.720 --> 03:25.260
instead of dividing sticks into in between three and four, what I can do is I can directly ask for

03:25.260 --> 03:27.630
this, which is one ratio of one off.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.910
The American states obviously have two options.

03:32.270 --> 03:34.250
Other bigger coin.

03:34.580 --> 03:38.300
You are in the three coins or what I can do is.

03:39.680 --> 03:45.790
The second option is to stick to a lawless anarchy within the exchange rate of bond issuance.

03:46.950 --> 03:50.390
So I just have to figure out, which gives me the better part.

03:51.140 --> 03:56.840
So some of you might be wondering that, of course, and this is one level down that is both exchange

03:56.840 --> 03:59.030
the going and see if the values are more or not.

03:59.460 --> 04:03.140
So here what we can see that X plus four plus three is 13.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.240
So basically, what does it mean?

04:06.730 --> 04:09.400
I hope I did them because I can.

04:14.340 --> 04:15.120
Yeah, I can.

04:17.510 --> 04:27.230
So now extend this fine of six by $6 made similarly forward by $4 entry but $3 eight because whatever

04:27.230 --> 04:31.280
is applicable to drill is also being able to six rate in six.

04:31.280 --> 04:36.050
Also, what I could have done is I could have divided the six into four other parts.

04:37.370 --> 04:42.990
That is six by two, six by six by three and six by four, which is one.

04:43.020 --> 04:45.320
So as you can see here, that.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.630
All the numbers are rounded down.

04:48.660 --> 04:49.410
This is important.

04:49.780 --> 04:52.230
Okay, so what is 6826 bird with three.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.310
But what is six by three.

04:53.340 --> 04:57.620
It is two and six before it becomes 1.2.

04:57.640 --> 04:57.930
Right.

04:58.230 --> 04:58.950
1.5.

04:59.370 --> 05:02.460
But it won't be 1.5 will be rounded out to it.

05:03.760 --> 05:04.470
So four, six.

05:04.470 --> 05:11.690
What I could have done is adder but $6 statically by having one ratio of one conversion rate.

05:11.700 --> 05:17.910
Or I could have asked for the best price of three as for the best face of two and asked for the best

05:17.910 --> 05:19.390
price of one eight.

05:19.530 --> 05:25.890
So whatever their best price is, what I could have added and checked whether making the $6 is better

05:25.920 --> 05:29.910
or going with the best prices of 3 to 1 was better.

05:30.180 --> 05:32.490
Similarly, it is also applicable for four.

05:32.490 --> 05:33.660
Also applicable for three.

05:34.540 --> 05:35.650
I hope you can see this.

05:36.130 --> 05:39.010
Why is it in our dynamic programming problem?

05:39.550 --> 05:46.210
Because if I were going, I do not know that whether if I divided into three parts, would that give

05:46.210 --> 05:47.110
me a better amount?

05:47.380 --> 05:53.090
Or if I directly ask for one ratio of an exchange, that would give me a better more.

05:53.930 --> 05:54.260
They'd.

05:55.670 --> 05:57.180
Oh, cool.

05:58.040 --> 06:02.960
So let's I hope we understood that it's very easy and let's go do this.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.310
But before that, I just want you to highlight.

06:05.350 --> 06:06.860
I want you to know this.

06:07.530 --> 06:08.090
It is.

06:09.980 --> 06:12.590
This part zero and.

06:14.950 --> 06:19.480
That means and is less than equal to 29 and to the power nine eight.

06:20.020 --> 06:22.150
And what could have been a record evolution in this?

06:22.150 --> 06:27.780
And by reaching this part of the course, you can easily, easily figure out that because the relation

06:28.030 --> 06:31.300
rate, which is nothing but F of x is equal to.

06:32.390 --> 06:33.530
A perfect way to.

06:34.510 --> 06:35.800
Less X by.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.130
Be less f of x be.

06:40.220 --> 06:47.150
Or that I'll take this or I'll simply gigs, which is the one ratio of an exchange rate.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.220
Whatever it is, a maximum of these two.

06:51.190 --> 06:52.900
I will take the bait.

06:53.620 --> 06:54.370
Just give me a sec.

06:55.090 --> 06:55.900
I hope that's clear.

06:56.700 --> 06:56.920
Eight.

06:57.810 --> 07:00.270
So this is a normal reconciliation board game.

07:00.310 --> 07:09.600
The best case if X is equal to zero standard in zero eight or if X is equal to 101, whatever you want,

07:09.870 --> 07:11.130
the base case can be set.

07:11.980 --> 07:12.400
And.

07:13.960 --> 07:17.800
The problem arises when and is equal to one in nine eight think.

07:18.940 --> 07:25.330
Now the main purpose of this problem was not the dynamic programming solution was about discussing the

07:25.330 --> 07:32.230
differences in a bottom up approach and a top down approach and which approach should be used in this

07:32.370 --> 07:32.680
debate.

07:33.200 --> 07:39.070
So you understand it looks good both the approaches and then will realize that BI is one of the approaches

07:39.070 --> 07:42.790
not working as we wanted to take the.

07:45.030 --> 07:45.270
Yeah.

07:45.690 --> 07:46.530
Let me quickly.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.520
Part of the approaches, but it is relevant to.

07:52.360 --> 07:52.990
Well, too.

07:53.200 --> 07:53.380
Okay.

07:53.410 --> 07:54.560
So then put in Buddhism.

07:54.580 --> 07:55.090
Okay.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.130
Each desk is a single line.

07:57.130 --> 07:57.580
Okay.

07:57.700 --> 07:58.090
Okay.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.860
Or each disc is out with a single line.

08:01.900 --> 08:02.120
Okay.

08:02.130 --> 08:04.200
It does not told us that.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.190
When will input in.

08:05.190 --> 08:10.260
So how do we deal with these same these type of inputs or will simply do will say in.

08:11.790 --> 08:13.800
And I simply say vile and minus me.

08:14.550 --> 08:16.250
But I'll be in.

08:17.720 --> 08:22.660
That means this CNN will just returned me whether I have gotten input or not.

08:22.750 --> 08:24.440
It will say that there is no input.

08:24.560 --> 08:25.970
Then it will break the loop.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.650
So let me show you.

08:34.390 --> 08:34.500
Yeah.

08:34.540 --> 08:36.370
I've just restarted the laptop, so it should.

08:36.610 --> 08:37.990
It will take the time for steam.

08:38.960 --> 08:39.820
Electability again.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.860
Yeah, well, as you can see, 12 is there.

08:43.070 --> 08:43.700
Two is there.

08:44.060 --> 08:47.300
But when for the next time there is no input.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.440
So the value breaks.

08:48.890 --> 08:50.670
So this is another way of thinking.

08:50.870 --> 08:52.280
Taking these types of inputs.

08:52.900 --> 08:53.060
It.

08:55.570 --> 08:55.990
Now.

08:57.670 --> 08:57.910
Yeah.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.410
Let's not.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.600
This is the forward.

09:02.930 --> 09:03.140
Yeah.

09:03.140 --> 09:04.310
This is the backward approach.

09:06.660 --> 09:06.920
Right.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.140
Or let's say them top down or bottom up.

09:10.140 --> 09:10.450
Right.

09:10.470 --> 09:12.930
So this is a bottom up approach that I'll be quoting here.

09:13.260 --> 09:18.630
And it's just nothing very simple that is at stake in every often.

09:19.770 --> 09:23.880
So tell me, guys, what will be the best answer for zero or one?

09:24.240 --> 09:31.800
It will be for zero zero because I cannot divided the value of zero is always zero and the value of

09:31.800 --> 09:32.430
one will be one.

09:32.520 --> 09:32.790
No.

09:33.630 --> 09:37.310
Even if we are divided by two, three and four, it will give me 000.

09:37.320 --> 09:41.480
And if I do have one ratio of $1 exchange rate, it will give me one eight.

09:41.730 --> 09:45.630
What I simply say it's this area between plus one.

09:51.840 --> 09:55.710
All this goes from to and it's feeling deep zero.

09:55.770 --> 09:57.750
It goes to the NDP.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.340
One wants to win.

10:00.030 --> 10:00.860
I hope this is fine.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.880
They let it start from deep too.

10:03.210 --> 10:08.700
And which is deep is nothing but mix of II, which is one issue, an exchange rate or API.

10:08.700 --> 10:09.090
Where to?

10:10.520 --> 10:11.570
API three.

10:13.770 --> 10:14.820
BP, eBay.

10:15.770 --> 10:16.010
Or.

10:17.410 --> 10:21.310
And the sum of all these eight, it means what's the best way?

10:21.550 --> 10:23.650
If I have these gold coins by two.

10:23.650 --> 10:24.370
By three by four.

10:26.450 --> 10:27.800
I hope you're able to understand this.

10:28.610 --> 10:34.160
And finally, what I do, I'll simply say c o dp or DP and.

10:35.490 --> 10:36.230
And let's see.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.520
Maximum of.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.340
Okay, so what I think is that initially.

10:48.210 --> 10:48.490
Okay.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.830
There's something that I'm missing and sitting in.

10:55.370 --> 10:55.850
Okay.

10:58.460 --> 10:58.640
It.

10:58.760 --> 10:59.510
Let me.

11:00.540 --> 11:01.290
It's zero.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.410
It pays max off this.

11:15.120 --> 11:15.370
Okay.

11:15.390 --> 11:15.610
Okay.

11:15.620 --> 11:15.810
Okay.

11:15.810 --> 11:21.900
So it will go less than equal to n I'm sorry, it was going to be less than and it was not filling the

11:21.900 --> 11:22.350
end well value.

11:23.930 --> 11:25.180
That you would.

11:26.400 --> 11:29.490
But here I have to play Cueto and then it will get greedy.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.760
Otherwise, it will give garbage values that we can see.

11:32.790 --> 11:39.270
Simple that for 12 year 13 and four two, we have to just think about the case when and will be equal

11:39.270 --> 11:40.290
to one inning.

11:41.350 --> 11:44.230
Oof and is equal to one in eight days stink.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.030
Will this work?

11:46.750 --> 11:51.790
Can we initialize this bigger in this tag memory or not even in the heap memory rate?

11:53.230 --> 11:53.890
Can we do this?

11:55.760 --> 11:56.180
NARRATOR.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.700
We have got their relation but we do not know how to call it.

11:59.710 --> 12:03.820
Then we won't be able to summon the solution and get a correct answer for this and get point.

12:06.140 --> 12:12.350
The bottom up approach will not work for this solution, and I will give you a reason why.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.030
So this is a bottom up approach.

12:14.850 --> 12:19.560
Well, and let me quickly comment about.

12:28.640 --> 12:28.840
Well.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.210
So this is a bottom up approach and this will not work.

12:34.280 --> 12:34.910
Let's see why.

12:35.030 --> 12:41.540
Because if we have the land which is so huge, then we cannot make an edit of.

12:42.140 --> 12:42.800
Vigeland three.

12:42.890 --> 12:47.640
But then you might be wondering then how will we how will we figure out that?

12:47.810 --> 12:49.280
What are the values then?

12:49.280 --> 12:51.680
How will we figure out the answer for such big numbers?

12:52.760 --> 12:54.110
Okay, just think about this.

12:55.050 --> 12:57.830
Just think about if the number is okay.

12:57.840 --> 12:58.680
Let's say the numbers.

12:58.860 --> 13:00.350
Well, I'm just giving you an example.

13:01.410 --> 13:01.800
What?

13:01.800 --> 13:04.140
All combinations will be good.

13:04.140 --> 13:05.370
Let's see who.

13:05.370 --> 13:08.490
And between six and by three is four.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.670
And by what is the eight?

13:12.090 --> 13:16.800
The can combination can be days combinations two and better is three and better is two.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.920
And in before this one eight.

13:19.230 --> 13:20.700
Similarly for three, we will have.

13:21.800 --> 13:29.850
Recombination, which is an arbitrary is one and by who is also one and by what will be zero eight.

13:30.230 --> 13:37.160
And for this also for this also visual will as any going to do and for forward will have all will have

13:37.430 --> 13:41.870
and battery is one and before it is one and ember two is two.

13:42.310 --> 13:45.790
Well, for this tree will have 1108.

13:46.040 --> 13:46.870
So here you can see.

13:47.000 --> 13:47.990
Is it.

13:49.190 --> 13:50.920
You'll find the answer for it, will.

13:52.310 --> 13:55.340
Do I need to deep value of 11?

13:57.400 --> 13:59.560
Do I need to develop an.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.570
Are those my possible states here?

14:03.320 --> 14:05.240
This deal directly starts from anywhere to.

14:06.080 --> 14:06.310
Eight.

14:06.590 --> 14:11.480
That means the numbers between and by to win.

14:12.460 --> 14:15.820
We are in, but it is not included and any alternative.

14:16.030 --> 14:17.830
All these numbers are not needed.

14:18.820 --> 14:20.710
But what we bottom up debate do?

14:21.430 --> 14:22.420
What does bottom up do?

14:22.420 --> 14:22.780
We do?

14:23.020 --> 14:27.580
It just calculates whatever I applied in the loop.

14:28.060 --> 14:32.110
If I have applied to the end, it will be cleared for all this date from two to in.

14:32.410 --> 14:38.560
Although, as my final answer is deep in and I do not need all the states that you have already seen

14:38.560 --> 14:38.740
here.

14:38.740 --> 14:39.070
Right.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.440
You find out the answer for 12.

14:41.830 --> 14:46.190
I do not need 11 or I do not need ten, nine, eight, seven.

14:46.210 --> 14:47.500
I don't need these numbers.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.830
And believe me or not, these are my two numbers.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.840
Just imagine if and is.

14:54.140 --> 14:57.920
Ended about nine and May two will be 580 about.

14:58.760 --> 15:05.210
So the numbers between five and do tend to deteriorate less one l than the debate over nine minus one.

15:06.260 --> 15:09.620
I don't need all these states at any moment in time.

15:09.620 --> 15:09.920
Right.

15:11.220 --> 15:13.950
I don't I don't want to get any answer for these.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.200
And how many are these between them?

15:16.470 --> 15:19.530
They will be approximately 528 states.

15:21.430 --> 15:21.700
It.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.170
I hope you are getting this point at.

15:28.860 --> 15:33.450
We don't need all the states in calculating the answer for the final state aid.

15:34.170 --> 15:35.640
So that's what I wanted to see.

15:37.110 --> 15:37.400
Yeah.

15:37.410 --> 15:38.070
So we can't.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.050
So that's the name of it.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.050
It is bottom up or it is backward induction.

15:43.130 --> 15:43.380
Right.

15:43.570 --> 15:45.840
We are moving from bag and we are going forward.

15:46.440 --> 15:50.760
It means we do not know whether forward it forward needs it or not.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.180
We are just saying you'll find me the answer.

15:54.660 --> 15:57.270
Go look back, find me the answer and give me and stored.

15:57.270 --> 15:58.910
It doesn't matter.

15:58.920 --> 15:59.760
I need it or not.

16:01.140 --> 16:02.010
But as you have seen.

16:03.170 --> 16:06.950
I don't need that many states who will go.

16:08.690 --> 16:11.050
Let's make some small tree for this.

16:11.630 --> 16:12.790
It just ended about nine.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.770
So it is 502 about it pretty well before.

16:15.830 --> 16:19.850
What will it give 200 something in return to power.

16:19.850 --> 16:20.030
It.

16:20.390 --> 16:20.540
It.

16:21.140 --> 16:21.440
Okay.

16:21.890 --> 16:22.640
Let's do one thing.

16:22.640 --> 16:22.970
Let's.

16:24.700 --> 16:25.150
Make.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.570
It could give us these values.

16:28.830 --> 16:29.070
So.

16:33.700 --> 16:34.840
Let's the.

16:38.730 --> 16:47.070
All this, and instead of calling DP the fat boss and do it virtually done it certainly smacks of.

16:49.010 --> 16:49.610
BP.

16:50.700 --> 16:51.360
And where to.

16:51.900 --> 17:00.300
There's a B and three less DP and four comma and it'll turn it on me.

17:00.300 --> 17:00.810
This rate.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.970
And what's the best case, if any?

17:02.970 --> 17:06.840
Close to zero or any good to one.

17:07.410 --> 17:10.560
In short event, is less than equal to one standard in.

17:12.020 --> 17:12.320
And.

17:13.260 --> 17:13.780
Always.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.230
So I have not memories that I know, but I will memories it.

17:16.560 --> 17:20.310
I just want to know what what all values of and are needed.

17:23.090 --> 17:26.180
In figuring it answer rate so quickly.

17:26.180 --> 17:28.340
Let me put this.

17:37.110 --> 17:38.300
I would be.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.180
So whenever this debate is called, we can see the answer is 13.

17:47.270 --> 17:48.770
But before this, see the states.

17:50.180 --> 17:51.620
That would call it.

17:51.620 --> 17:55.270
So we don't see this ten, 11 or nine, eight or seven.

17:55.490 --> 17:57.170
We also don't see five, eight.

17:57.170 --> 18:00.470
Similarly, there'll be many of the gaps if the number of a number was huge.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.080
So let's talk about 120.

18:05.470 --> 18:10.290
But as you can see, there are not much states that we need in 2011.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.540
Okay, let's do one thing.

18:12.540 --> 18:15.120
Let's count the number of states that are needed.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.200
I hope it will make things clear.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.280
Utility count plus.

18:20.280 --> 18:20.530
Plus.

18:20.550 --> 18:24.510
Let's dig in the variable called bound states with zero.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.620
When you will call this filmmaker zero and will simply print out the count as well.

18:35.030 --> 18:39.120
To repeat, the answer is 140 for 120.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.980
But see how many states are being called?

18:41.190 --> 18:41.910
Only seven.

18:43.990 --> 18:48.260
8 to 76 times the coalition is being called.

18:48.280 --> 18:52.030
It doesn't mean that there are 76 states because.

18:53.210 --> 18:54.260
And can we be right?

18:54.530 --> 18:56.640
We have seen that treating so many times.

18:56.660 --> 18:57.820
You can go many times.

18:58.990 --> 19:01.110
You can come many times foregoing community aid.

19:01.750 --> 19:05.320
So what is the best way in which I can see this?

19:06.360 --> 19:11.880
Let me give you the B, I'm slightly deviating from the solution, but there's one thing that I want

19:11.880 --> 19:12.600
to show to you.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.340
And that will help you.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.370
But what I'm doing.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.170
I'm doing a map.

19:22.180 --> 19:23.170
I'm mapping things.

19:23.170 --> 19:26.440
And here I simply write ambulances in this.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.570
Right before 120.

19:32.570 --> 19:35.300
I just used 14 states for two.

19:36.400 --> 19:40.450
I will use less than 14 states equally, he added.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.440
Or do I just use one state?

19:43.470 --> 19:43.770
Right.

19:44.070 --> 19:45.690
And for let's say.

19:50.400 --> 19:50.760
Okay.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.710
So far, well, thousand.

19:53.310 --> 19:56.010
There are only 50 distinct states that I'm using.

19:57.290 --> 19:59.480
I hope you're getting this for Android Auto.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.220
Only 50 listing states.

20:01.220 --> 20:02.570
Even I can bring them if I want.

20:02.570 --> 20:07.480
I can simply print the whole map and I can see that which state is being called?

20:07.490 --> 20:08.120
How many times?

20:09.750 --> 20:12.750
So as you can see there, not much students have been called over here.

20:13.180 --> 20:16.410
What is the best way if not all of them are called by?

20:16.980 --> 20:18.770
I don't need to fill all deliberate.

20:18.780 --> 20:20.430
I don't need to go bottom up here.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.710
I need to do it.

20:23.250 --> 20:26.730
But our top down is kind of, we can say artificially intelligent.

20:26.730 --> 20:29.640
It will only call those deep states which are needed.

20:31.270 --> 20:31.560
Eight.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.470
So this is the best part of top down.

20:35.650 --> 20:38.190
It will only call those states which are needed.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.850
So here it is a forward p here.

20:39.850 --> 20:47.650
I know that what I need and I will only asked him to calculate those t eight and how can I memorize?

20:47.650 --> 20:49.120
It goes very simple.

20:49.690 --> 20:52.090
So as you can see, I have to the power of nine.

20:53.220 --> 20:54.050
Values, right?

20:54.420 --> 20:56.250
There are two ways in which I can name wizard.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.260
The first is very simple.

20:58.770 --> 21:01.070
You buy map eight and.

21:02.780 --> 21:03.370
Visitors will.

21:04.360 --> 21:04.840
And don't.

21:05.260 --> 21:10.990
Yeah, and don't clear the map because there are certain test cases in this.

21:11.530 --> 21:15.310
But let's see if I was able to find out the value of Ippy then.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.300
Then the next case.

21:16.300 --> 21:17.610
Also my trade.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.910
And if when it hit, I simply did in the value from the average.

21:22.410 --> 21:22.650
Well.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.120
So here what I'll do.

21:24.120 --> 21:28.680
I simply say that MP and equates to something.

21:29.490 --> 21:35.810
I it right and before this what I'll do is if embittered contain handwritten MP.

21:36.790 --> 21:40.000
Well, that means if map contains n then simply return it.

21:40.210 --> 21:46.710
Otherwise, if it does not contain bounded spirit and its so input.

21:47.710 --> 21:54.160
So in this way, what we can do is no matter how many states are being formed because we have seen for

21:54.160 --> 21:56.650
12,000, only 50 states were called.

21:57.640 --> 22:00.490
Just imagine what will happen if the number is one in nine.

22:01.530 --> 22:06.960
There will be very little number of states that will be formed and and the daubed daubed on the base

22:06.960 --> 22:10.680
going only all those places and I'll simply memorize it.

22:11.290 --> 22:16.170
So some of you might be wondering why I took my job in my northern area of particular land.

22:16.810 --> 22:18.720
So, as you all know, I cannot.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.040
Memories of any name.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.440
Kind of numbers, such huge numbers in the area because it is limited.

22:24.830 --> 22:30.800
But yes, there's a second approach to this problem, and that is what I can do is I have seen that

22:30.890 --> 22:36.290
we are always moving by to do it with three or four and then we'll again move divided by two divided

22:36.290 --> 22:37.430
by three divided by four.

22:38.240 --> 22:43.100
So what I can do is I can take an adequate memo of Land 26.

22:44.780 --> 22:49.880
And I can simply memorize the numbers if there are less than equal to one in six, if they go beyond

22:49.880 --> 22:50.840
that above only six.

22:51.080 --> 22:56.510
I don't need to memorize because there'd be very few numbers because we are jumping by to always rate.

22:56.870 --> 23:02.930
So if we start jumping by two, then we can easily see that we'll reach a number less than one in six.

23:02.930 --> 23:07.040
In like two three steps only be four steps and not not much.

23:08.690 --> 23:08.880
Well.

23:08.970 --> 23:15.500
So this is a second approach with lacking approach of memorization, but I would always prefer map.

23:15.740 --> 23:17.330
It doesn't take much time.

23:17.330 --> 23:22.820
And if you want, even if you wanted to perform in all one memorization, then you can simply make it

23:22.820 --> 23:23.480
an ordered map.

23:24.790 --> 23:25.010
I'd.

23:26.780 --> 23:26.990
Well.

23:28.190 --> 23:32.050
So this is a very simple working solution.

23:32.060 --> 23:33.950
So in this I'll simply write down.

23:36.000 --> 23:36.170
I've.

23:38.140 --> 23:38.860
So top down.

23:39.250 --> 23:45.460
I always prefer top down whenever I try to call it a deep problem because up top down is intelligent.

23:45.460 --> 23:48.110
We have seen it right now is the proof rate.

23:48.500 --> 23:52.570
It will only call those states, but it will not fill the table uselessly.

23:52.570 --> 23:54.250
It will not fill in error uselessly.

23:54.550 --> 23:58.270
And also, if it only calls some particular states, it is saving.

23:58.270 --> 24:04.300
My time as a light is not taking all the time in the world to calculate all the states which I don't

24:04.300 --> 24:04.600
need.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.990
And the sacredness of the.

24:09.120 --> 24:15.540
The recursive thing in dynamic programming can easily be understood by using a recursion, by using

24:15.540 --> 24:17.580
some recursion, and then memorizing it.

24:19.090 --> 24:22.090
So I can easily write a recording for an enemy program problem.

24:22.240 --> 24:29.740
And writing a bottom up record is kind of a little tricky for me as of late, because in there we just

24:29.740 --> 24:32.560
use some loops that we can only use, some for loops and other things.

24:32.830 --> 24:37.240
We have to take care of many things in bottom up approach.

24:37.960 --> 24:44.140
Many things, as in like indexing goes out of bound sometimes index goes negative, all those things,

24:44.170 --> 24:44.460
right?

24:44.470 --> 24:45.250
And for loops.

24:46.090 --> 24:47.200
So this is very easy.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.090
Just pass whatever you want to pass.

24:49.570 --> 24:52.090
Write recursive solution and memorize it.

24:54.270 --> 24:55.170
I hope you got this.

24:55.170 --> 24:57.190
The difference between top down and bottom up.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.250
And soon the next part.
