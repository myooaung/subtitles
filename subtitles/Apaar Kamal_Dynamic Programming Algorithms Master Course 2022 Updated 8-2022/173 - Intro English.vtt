00:00.690 --> 00:01.470
Hello, everyone.

00:01.500 --> 00:03.330
Welcome to some of us upstairs, ADP.

00:03.900 --> 00:09.240
This is the shortest dynamic programming implementation that you will ever see.

00:09.790 --> 00:11.760
So let's begin over this.

00:11.770 --> 00:17.460
And before moving on, I'll just a few more lines, so I'll just say it in an asterisk.

00:17.460 --> 00:19.590
DB Whenever I say so, is it simple?

00:19.590 --> 00:19.800
It is.

00:19.800 --> 00:20.640
Someone was upset.

00:21.090 --> 00:27.090
The second thing is that recently I, I was there, I was participating in a kickstart contest and I

00:27.090 --> 00:27.870
saw that.

00:28.970 --> 00:30.750
There was the problem of SDP.

00:31.550 --> 00:37.790
So what I realize is that the that the students who know what what is SDP and have practiced it, they

00:37.790 --> 00:39.110
see this all the problem.

00:39.380 --> 00:42.650
They realised that it is also SDP in this all the problem within 10 minutes.

00:43.010 --> 00:48.590
And it was you know the hardest problem of the accept and those who did not know about SDP and they

00:48.590 --> 00:53.780
took a very long time, maybe went over the Internet or tried to understand it and then came back and

00:53.780 --> 00:54.230
solved it.

00:55.070 --> 01:02.000
But it was very harsh, very hard for them to solve the SSD because it's it's one of those topics like

01:02.360 --> 01:03.470
those who know they know.

01:03.470 --> 01:03.790
Right.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.090
It's that kind of a topic.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.590
So what does it say?

01:07.620 --> 01:10.180
So let's say that the value assigned to each and every subset.

01:10.380 --> 01:12.060
So let's say we have various options here.

01:12.060 --> 01:12.930
I have an example.

01:13.770 --> 01:16.920
I have subsets that are done over here and their values.

01:17.430 --> 01:17.630
They.

01:18.830 --> 01:23.420
Before us, it is found the sum of values of all the substance, each alliance.

01:23.630 --> 01:24.500
It's very simple.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.410
For example, let's say I want to find the.

01:29.940 --> 01:33.600
Some of this said that is, let's say one comma.

01:33.690 --> 01:34.050
Did he?

01:35.370 --> 01:41.850
So if I want to find the sum of one commodity, what I have is I have to find out the sum of all the

01:41.850 --> 01:43.350
values of those sets.

01:43.350 --> 01:44.010
Which line?

01:44.010 --> 01:45.210
One in three, right.

01:45.510 --> 01:46.770
So basically what?

01:46.770 --> 01:47.160
All six.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.000
Line one in three.

01:48.990 --> 01:50.340
So which is this value?

01:50.340 --> 01:51.120
Let's write these.

01:51.420 --> 01:51.770
Let's.

01:52.230 --> 01:54.420
So the first is Phi Phi lies in every set.

01:54.420 --> 01:54.750
Right?

01:55.230 --> 01:57.030
And the second one can be one alone.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.360
If I talk about one, then the next one can be three alone.

02:00.360 --> 02:03.200
And the next one can be one comma three.

02:03.510 --> 02:09.900
So we can see that we have only four different unique subsets which are possible for almost one common

02:09.900 --> 02:10.230
trait.

02:10.650 --> 02:20.220
So here are s is one commentary and it values as per the formula is five one, three, one and three.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.920
And I want to find it sums I.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.410
Let's calculate this sum.

02:27.540 --> 02:29.100
So for five we have two.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.360
For one we have three.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.040
For three we have one.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.000
And for one, two.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.710
He said, we have to support this on the summit, two plus, two plus for it.

02:38.160 --> 02:38.460
Right.

02:38.670 --> 02:45.270
So as of one, comma, three already some office is nothing but it.

02:45.270 --> 02:45.840
In our case.

02:46.380 --> 02:47.970
I hope we are getting the whole point here.

02:47.970 --> 02:48.300
Right.

02:48.600 --> 02:54.690
So what we have to do is for all the subsets which lie in that set completely, completely is important,

02:54.690 --> 02:54.920
right.

02:54.930 --> 03:02.340
Because if, if I talk about one common three, I can also say that one comma two blind sided because

03:02.340 --> 03:03.210
one lies inside it.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.710
But this should not be included.

03:04.710 --> 03:10.500
It included in my subset because it does not lie completely inside it.

03:10.500 --> 03:10.770
Right.

03:10.770 --> 03:15.060
So I hope you have heard about the term proper, proper subsets and.

03:16.620 --> 03:16.860
Yeah.

03:16.860 --> 03:22.230
So we're just talking about those that subsets areas like completely inside the above subset.

03:22.590 --> 03:29.550
So in the as in the previous section of DB with M&amp;S, we always seen that we represent.

03:30.330 --> 03:34.590
So we represent these using integers or in short must.

03:34.830 --> 03:35.070
Right.

03:35.220 --> 03:37.270
So let's represent these as mass.

03:37.290 --> 03:38.370
Let's try to understand that.

03:38.370 --> 03:39.070
So is deep with.

03:40.230 --> 03:41.520
By relating it to mask.

03:41.850 --> 03:42.150
Okay.

03:42.720 --> 03:42.810
So.

03:43.050 --> 03:43.170
So.

03:43.170 --> 03:43.770
Let's say I've.

03:45.170 --> 03:50.450
I have a number 747 seven has this must be said so I can retain and interpret it.

03:50.450 --> 03:50.990
I'm just thinking.

03:50.990 --> 03:53.960
But with indexing, you know this seven.

03:55.890 --> 04:01.540
This seven has how many how many substrates which lie completely inside it.

04:01.950 --> 04:09.330
So we can say that seven has all the numbers from 0 to 7 which lie completely inside straight by because

04:09.330 --> 04:17.340
zero belie inside seven one also lies inside it because we can see one in seven or seven can be opposite

04:17.340 --> 04:17.610
of one.

04:17.610 --> 04:17.880
Right.

04:18.660 --> 04:22.980
And there's an external also that you can easily related with the maths.

04:22.980 --> 04:23.700
It is simple.

04:24.060 --> 04:31.080
If I have E which belongs to S, that means E which lies inside as E which belongs to the set of absurd

04:31.080 --> 04:31.440
office.

04:31.740 --> 04:34.470
Then what I would say is that e.

04:35.190 --> 04:35.670
And.

04:37.140 --> 04:39.180
As should be called a.

04:40.370 --> 04:40.760
Correct.

04:41.390 --> 04:45.140
Because if it is a subset of is and I'm right I'm talking about bit.

04:45.920 --> 04:48.920
So if I take their and values eight.

04:49.190 --> 04:54.680
If I take the average of the subset and these 4%, then that should be equal to exactly as the subset,

04:54.680 --> 04:57.300
because all those bits should lie inside, as says.

04:58.940 --> 05:00.590
For example, one in seven will be.

05:01.710 --> 05:09.390
But similarly, 27 will also be two, then three, and there will also be three, right?

05:09.720 --> 05:12.690
So it's seven will be a busy example.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.120
So let's move to some other example.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.740
It related this is important.

05:19.630 --> 05:25.030
Let's talk about this, which is I covered all other lines.

05:25.030 --> 05:26.470
I report all of the big lines.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.220
First of all, let's talk about how many different words blindsided.

05:30.590 --> 05:34.630
We all know we have two options for this route, whether it will come, what it will not complete.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.960
Similarly, this bid will come or this will will not come.

05:37.960 --> 05:38.230
Right?

05:38.470 --> 05:41.680
So let's try to make that three letter.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.640
The first bit comes.

05:43.610 --> 05:44.840
And of course, it doesn't come.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.940
So it is 100 and 101.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.590
Now, let's talk about this.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.480
Edit The first bit comes or it doesn't come.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.710
So it is 100.

05:53.920 --> 05:54.220
Okay.

05:54.220 --> 05:58.210
So if it comes to this 1000008.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.910
Similarly we have 4101 whether.

06:03.720 --> 06:08.250
The second, because we have already wondered about the first bit.

06:08.580 --> 06:09.910
Now let's go to the second word.

06:09.920 --> 06:17.010
So whether the second word will come, which is 101, and if it doesn't come, it is 0018.

06:17.020 --> 06:19.070
So this is the second and.

06:20.670 --> 06:20.820
Here.

06:20.820 --> 06:25.850
You can see we have got all four different subsets which can lie inside the.

06:27.810 --> 06:29.310
I think they'd be just fine.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.540
So what?

06:30.540 --> 06:37.440
All other masks are completely inside s so we can see this is for all license 850.

06:37.470 --> 06:37.950
Of course.

06:38.790 --> 06:39.410
Of course.

06:39.410 --> 06:41.370
The lines eight five and one eight.

06:41.400 --> 06:46.570
So we have to go when I want to calculate some of five eight.

06:46.920 --> 06:52.050
So what I'm saying why I'm digging five here, because five is not nothing but this mosque.

06:52.710 --> 06:54.210
Eight, it is 101.

06:54.420 --> 06:57.480
Then I actually have to take the value of.

06:59.470 --> 07:01.900
This 100 plus value of.

07:03.060 --> 07:05.220
000 plus value of.

07:06.220 --> 07:10.800
101 less value of 001.

07:10.810 --> 07:17.380
I hope you got this right, because all these mask lines are these particular lines are this.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.080
That's correct.

07:19.380 --> 07:23.490
Now, let's convert this mosque into integers and let's see what we get.

07:23.790 --> 07:27.510
We have some of five is nothing but a value of four.

07:27.780 --> 07:31.350
Plus value of zero plus value of five.

07:33.010 --> 07:33.520
Well, you've.

07:34.550 --> 07:36.950
One so that we can see that the value of two.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.270
So this was five.

07:38.330 --> 07:43.810
That means ten zero and said this said contains zero in two only.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.230
So it has only two terms.

07:45.710 --> 07:48.890
But we can easily see that two does not lie inside five.

07:49.220 --> 07:56.990
Three does not lie inside five, but it does not like completely inside five and one lies or lies five

07:56.990 --> 07:59.330
of course lies six does not lie inside five.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.310
Seven will of course not lie.

08:01.310 --> 08:04.190
So all the above sounds never lines.

08:04.190 --> 08:04.880
Eight, five, eight.

08:06.580 --> 08:08.730
But this was SARS.

08:09.030 --> 08:09.650
Nothing else.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.700
So we want these some worse upsets.

08:11.910 --> 08:14.100
And for those upsets, we want this one.

08:16.330 --> 08:22.090
So for those subsets we want do some so that they like completely inside this eight eight inch or they

08:22.100 --> 08:31.270
should be true and as is equal to a correct and yeah so in the next year there will be a will be the

08:31.270 --> 08:37.570
DP solution of this, how to code this and then we'll solve some very, very interesting problems like

08:37.870 --> 08:38.950
this section.

08:38.950 --> 08:41.680
SDP will have the most interesting problems we'll ever see.

08:42.190 --> 08:42.440
Eight.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.590
We'll see you in the next part.

08:45.610 --> 08:46.090
Thank you.
