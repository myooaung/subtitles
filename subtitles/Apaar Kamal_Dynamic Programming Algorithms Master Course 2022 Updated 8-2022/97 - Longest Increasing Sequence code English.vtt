WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:00.790
Yep.

00:00.900 --> 00:02.520
So let's call this Alice.

00:03.640 --> 00:05.140
Yes, I've already written.

00:06.070 --> 00:08.050
I want to read it in the over here.

00:08.570 --> 00:10.810
And might be.

00:10.810 --> 00:13.090
I might have made some mistake.

00:13.090 --> 00:13.540
I don't know.

00:13.540 --> 00:13.990
I'm not sure.

00:13.990 --> 00:17.100
But let's let's segue by a feeling of deep, deep values.

00:18.460 --> 00:19.990
But initially, let's take.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.930
And which is 12.

00:22.850 --> 00:24.020
And let's dig in, Eddie.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.100
And let's be.

00:26.840 --> 00:27.760
It's already on there.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.310
If it is dpn initially what we'll do is we'll fill AP with zero.

00:31.630 --> 00:33.650
Okay, so let me flip it.

00:37.710 --> 00:37.880
I'm.

00:40.220 --> 00:41.660
I just filled up with zero.

00:41.660 --> 00:44.720
And now what I'll do is let's take the area as an input.

00:46.450 --> 00:46.720
Yeah.

00:47.410 --> 00:50.320
Now let's move over for all the indexes.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.990
What I'll do is I'll move all the indexes.

00:53.170 --> 01:01.420
I'll go for all this data and try to find out the alias instead of the P.

01:02.450 --> 01:03.910
Let's call it really cool.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.180
It sounds good.

01:06.660 --> 01:07.740
What else is?

01:09.490 --> 01:12.760
For particular, I let me quickly commented.

01:14.480 --> 01:14.730
Be.

01:14.870 --> 01:16.430
I will tell me.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.830
Um, L.A. is.

01:20.500 --> 01:21.970
EPA tells me the.

01:22.780 --> 01:30.170
If it ends on I it index it both.

01:31.350 --> 01:34.370
For a particular I look, let's just think about this in this way.

01:34.380 --> 01:37.590
Let's m standing somewhere in the middle of the 88.

01:38.100 --> 01:45.540
What I have to do is I have to start from the zero, the index and all the I'm minus one index check

01:46.170 --> 01:49.290
which values are smaller than the current value for whatever.

01:49.800 --> 01:55.200
But for all those values which have the values smaller than the current value, I will simply pick up

01:55.200 --> 01:58.410
their deep values, the best ending they can provide me.

01:59.520 --> 02:03.840
I just simply take the maxim of all their best earnings and didn't answer.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.850
For example, let me write it.

02:05.980 --> 02:06.750
That would be better.

02:09.540 --> 02:10.800
So yeah, there it goes.

02:10.800 --> 02:18.960
Evolution that could be there by looking at this example it is simply a deep of some particular a is

02:18.960 --> 02:22.740
equal to maximum of G.

02:24.120 --> 02:24.350
Eight.

02:25.120 --> 02:32.490
There is less than I, of course, because counting the rate though all those GS, it means I just have

02:32.490 --> 02:33.870
to look at the previous indexes.

02:34.440 --> 02:36.840
Eight days less than I.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.310
Under that condition.

02:40.310 --> 02:41.390
What can the second condition?

02:41.930 --> 02:42.840
E of g.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.520
It's less than equal to Alpha.

02:47.600 --> 02:53.270
That means, of course, the indexes should be back, but their value should also be smaller than the

02:53.270 --> 02:53.870
current value.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.710
That's what we were doing in it.

02:55.850 --> 02:56.750
So let's call this.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.340
We'll take maximum of all of them.

02:59.460 --> 03:03.740
What I say is I simply say the DPI is maximum of.

03:06.140 --> 03:06.590
Yippee.

03:07.280 --> 03:12.890
Because I'm taking MAXINE for the EPA plus one plus one goes up because I'm including the current value.

03:13.670 --> 03:16.960
And of course, I have to apply an airfare which is free of G.

03:17.300 --> 03:17.540
Yeah.

03:17.690 --> 03:18.500
One more condition.

03:18.980 --> 03:20.020
It should be less.

03:20.030 --> 03:21.350
And I think we can go.

03:21.350 --> 03:21.740
Dylan.

03:24.790 --> 03:25.230
Hmm.

03:25.510 --> 03:25.750
Yeah.

03:27.750 --> 03:35.010
So if it is less than equal to I'm thinking equal to because it depends on the problem.

03:35.250 --> 03:40.860
If problems is defined strictly increasing sequences, that means it can't even be equal.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.950
Then I simply remove this equal to otherwise.

03:43.980 --> 03:45.270
Let's have this right.

03:45.690 --> 03:45.990
So.

03:48.060 --> 03:53.040
DPA is maximum of whatever DPA value tag plus comma, deep depression.

03:53.490 --> 04:01.190
And I'm taking the DPD only for those whose ed lesson is and goes from zero to less than a.

04:02.380 --> 04:04.750
I hope this is being clear.

04:06.210 --> 04:08.040
So let's try to bring this.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.960
Bring the values of eBay.

04:13.650 --> 04:14.760
Literally opening day.

04:14.940 --> 04:16.340
And let's bring in DP.

04:18.830 --> 04:19.120
30.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.940
I think there's something wrong.

04:31.360 --> 04:31.640
Okay.

04:31.690 --> 04:32.440
There's nothing wrong.

04:36.270 --> 04:37.110
a02 in.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.560
Okay, so a very good case that I missed.

04:40.890 --> 04:45.150
Instead of filling all the IDPs with zero, I think I should fill them with one.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.330
Because they say that the base case rate.

04:49.430 --> 04:49.970
What is.

04:49.970 --> 04:51.230
What is the meaning of base case?

04:52.220 --> 04:52.750
Meaning.

04:53.480 --> 04:54.230
Initially.

04:56.550 --> 04:57.030
Okay.

04:57.480 --> 04:57.810
Okay.

04:58.230 --> 05:01.050
Instead of this, we fill it by.

05:02.290 --> 05:03.250
EPA goes to it.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.530
Why does memo said one does not work?

05:05.530 --> 05:09.490
Because ma'am said works according to the binder numbers made before.

05:09.760 --> 05:13.180
What it will do is convert a one in binary and then fill the things.

05:14.130 --> 05:16.500
I can also make a separate, beautiful day.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.740
Well, here you can see what's there when I have one.

05:20.670 --> 05:27.240
Initially, I had zero in the previous output because I did not feel the value of already -- to

05:27.240 --> 05:27.540
be one.

05:28.260 --> 05:29.910
But yeah.

05:29.940 --> 05:31.530
So for seven it fell zero.

05:31.530 --> 05:32.760
But it should be one.

05:33.060 --> 05:40.050
I hope this would initially already be really should be when the minimum give we take about because.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.470
The current guy can be in the.

05:45.500 --> 05:49.760
Long as the Korean guy has to be in the longest degrading sequence that ends on the index.

05:50.390 --> 05:52.100
Let's talk about the degrading sequence.

05:53.560 --> 05:53.960
Let's see.

05:53.980 --> 05:55.570
What is the value we're getting here?

05:58.910 --> 06:00.290
I think there's something wrong.

06:00.290 --> 06:01.160
It's building in.

06:02.230 --> 06:02.650
Eddie.

06:02.650 --> 06:04.300
Long time, 7.70.

06:06.070 --> 06:06.730
They started.

06:08.190 --> 06:10.660
So here you can see it's 11118.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.170
These are really deep values and.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.960
And let's also do it.

06:16.970 --> 06:17.870
Foreign ingredients.

06:18.890 --> 06:19.580
You got this.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.340
And I just want you to relate to all these deep values.

06:22.910 --> 06:24.500
What should we realize here?

06:26.610 --> 06:33.030
So L.A. uses one minimum rate and it is equal to a maximum of all the deep values.

06:35.140 --> 06:36.190
Because Elliot can.

06:36.190 --> 06:36.880
And anyway, you.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.030
So let's vote.

06:40.360 --> 06:40.960
And I guess.

06:45.650 --> 06:47.290
At the beginning of a course kind of.

06:47.300 --> 06:50.710
And here we are just trying to understand how does one GDP work?

06:51.380 --> 06:55.250
This is one dimensional here because I can see there's only one variable associated with it.

06:55.790 --> 06:59.780
Of course there are two four loops, but it doesn't mean it's a good ADP.

07:00.810 --> 07:08.120
The dimension of data, the dimension of the GDP value is one which is changing at for this is five.

07:11.070 --> 07:11.340
What?

07:11.340 --> 07:11.700
This.

07:11.700 --> 07:12.570
Let's find out.

07:12.660 --> 07:14.100
It has to be five again.

07:14.370 --> 07:15.150
That's what we saw.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.060
One, two, two, two, three, three, four, four, four, three, five, four.

07:21.290 --> 07:21.610
Good.

07:21.620 --> 07:22.550
I hope you got this.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.740
What's the complexity of the solution?

07:25.700 --> 07:28.130
It is off and into.

07:29.360 --> 07:33.950
And because of this for a loop, this double for a loop with an and square rate.

07:34.640 --> 07:39.500
Because they start from zero goes to I it's kind of in square only because it is one plus two plus three

07:39.500 --> 07:40.310
plus four and so on.

07:40.310 --> 07:43.460
Dylan Which is an unpleasant way to kind of integrate.

07:44.640 --> 07:45.170
And then.

07:45.180 --> 07:45.630
And.

07:45.630 --> 07:46.530
And my husband made.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.410
But some of us tended to.

07:51.190 --> 07:53.380
Which indirectly becomes and square will.

07:54.670 --> 07:56.890
So yeah, thanks everyone for watching this.

07:57.640 --> 08:04.090
And we'll optimize these layers in the advance section, in the advanced data structure section in which

08:04.090 --> 08:07.150
we will see how to easily find a user in and log in.

08:08.410 --> 08:10.330
And there's another section, deep approach.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.690
Finally, yes, it is upper bound.

08:14.200 --> 08:20.650
Basically my research research, which also it is kind of dynamic programming plus my research and that

08:20.650 --> 08:24.010
can also find give you this is in and log in.

08:24.580 --> 08:25.630
We will discuss that as well.

08:26.380 --> 08:26.730
Thank you.

08:26.790 --> 08:27.070
And you?
