WEBVTT

00:00.620 --> 00:01.340
And everyone.

00:01.850 --> 00:07.670
It's all this beautiful problem and it is a colorful knapsack problem.

00:08.460 --> 00:15.960
So basically admitted the problem very quickly you are given and stones labeled one through in the eighth

00:15.960 --> 00:25.160
stone has a weight wc there are m colors labeled labeled by integers from one to him two basically with

00:25.170 --> 00:26.610
m colours and stones.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.620
The stone has a colour.

00:28.650 --> 00:34.350
C So we have been given these cias and W are using the other constraints.

00:34.350 --> 00:34.500
So.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.310
CS for colour.

00:35.310 --> 00:36.150
WS for weight.

00:37.060 --> 00:41.320
Eight and Sears were doing random mapping of the building's full.

00:42.500 --> 00:48.970
You are required to select exactly Emma Stone's version of each colour, some of which must not exceed

00:48.970 --> 00:49.270
six.

00:49.900 --> 00:50.560
So this is.

00:51.900 --> 00:56.930
True that you cannot select and place one stones or minus one stones.

00:56.940 --> 00:57.690
You have to select.

00:57.690 --> 00:58.330
Exactly.

00:58.340 --> 00:58.830
Gemstone.

01:00.120 --> 01:00.500
And.

01:03.150 --> 01:03.350
Yeah.

01:03.420 --> 01:07.050
So we need to just find the best way to fill the knapsack.

01:07.620 --> 01:09.590
So they're done, use capacities minimized.

01:10.290 --> 01:13.940
So basically we have to maximize the items taken.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.990
But the only thing is we have to select.

01:15.990 --> 01:16.470
Exactly.

01:17.990 --> 01:18.500
Exactly.

01:18.500 --> 01:18.920
Armstrong.

01:19.130 --> 01:21.230
M I am items eight.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.740
So yeah, he's a quick example.

01:24.740 --> 01:31.580
This is example one that I have which is an extreme is three axes, five to the knapsack, the capacity

01:31.580 --> 01:32.990
of five feet.

01:33.110 --> 01:34.580
So basically we have an.

01:36.190 --> 01:37.160
Oh, and stones.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.380
How many stones are there?

01:38.500 --> 01:40.390
No, we have three stones to all of them.

01:40.390 --> 01:40.780
Ever.

01:40.780 --> 01:42.010
Rate of one.

01:42.930 --> 01:46.140
Well, these are it and these are the colors we can see.

01:46.530 --> 01:48.630
The first one is a color 1 seconds.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.640
One has a color two, and third stone has a color.

01:51.540 --> 01:53.340
So right now, we don't have any other options.

01:53.520 --> 01:54.990
That means we have.

01:56.120 --> 01:56.610
All this?

01:56.930 --> 01:59.110
We have exactly one stone for all the colors.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.940
We have to select those stones.

02:01.400 --> 02:01.630
Right.

02:01.940 --> 02:04.540
And when we select those stones, what's their total weight?

02:04.550 --> 02:06.800
It is one plus one plus one, which is three.

02:07.070 --> 02:09.380
And we can see that two is less than equal to fight.

02:10.070 --> 02:10.610
That means.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.070
Yes, but of course, guys, there might be a possibility that.

02:17.230 --> 02:23.050
You are not able to select M stones so that the weight is less than equal to x.

02:23.270 --> 02:28.210
I might be possible, for example, here if it was for.

02:29.240 --> 02:33.770
The way it was formulated, then it would have been four plus one plus one, because now it's compulsory

02:33.770 --> 02:39.200
to select this stone because this is the only going off color of one eight.

02:39.350 --> 02:42.320
So here you can see two, six and six is greater than five.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.150
Therefore we cannot pick it up.

02:44.270 --> 02:47.590
Then in that case, what we'll do is we simply return minus one eight.

02:47.660 --> 02:53.990
So just keep that case in mind or maybe ignore that case in you might think after this, we'll only

02:53.990 --> 02:56.150
worry about if there's always a possibility.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.050
So some of you might be thinking, why don't we try greedy here?

03:00.350 --> 03:02.720
Why don't we see that?

03:03.020 --> 03:03.350
Okay.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.170
We have let's say we have five students of color.

03:06.170 --> 03:08.930
One later we have three students of color, two.

03:08.930 --> 03:11.000
And let's say we have ten students of color.

03:12.570 --> 03:17.520
Three eight and a mystery out of all these five students of color.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.350
One, why don't we just select the one with the maximum weight?

03:20.370 --> 03:22.800
Why don't we just select the one with the maximum rate here?

03:23.250 --> 03:24.450
Out of these two teaspoons.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.600
And why don't we select the one with the maximum weight out of this?

03:29.030 --> 03:31.600
Then they'd go further.

03:31.640 --> 03:35.120
I have a second case for you where you can see that.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.470
And is it so we have it.

03:36.470 --> 03:40.580
Stones three is M so we have only at max three colors.

03:40.590 --> 03:44.810
You can see this is wheat and this is colors.

03:44.900 --> 03:47.870
This is and this is M and this is X.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.960
But the knapsack episode is ten eight.

03:51.290 --> 03:57.820
Right now what I can see is that we have three stones of color one me it, color one we have stone with

03:58.010 --> 04:04.220
two with red, three with very full color two we have stone with two with very fluid and the wait for

04:04.220 --> 04:08.540
you and for color three we have stone with are two inward three.

04:09.110 --> 04:14.540
But why can't I just select the ones which have the maximum waits for all the colors?

04:15.050 --> 04:15.320
Eight.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.360
So here you can easily see that.

04:17.360 --> 04:24.380
I know let's say that this is not equal to ten but instead equal to 13 the capacity of the knapsack.

04:25.310 --> 04:31.850
So here we can easily see that four plus five plus three is equal to, well, eight and 12 is less than

04:32.240 --> 04:33.110
less than six.

04:34.070 --> 04:41.810
Therefore, this is a valid answer that the maximum the maximum knapsack that I can fill is 12 eight.

04:42.230 --> 04:43.370
But what if.

04:44.670 --> 04:48.780
It was, let's say, 11, let's say, if a knapsack was 11.

04:49.110 --> 04:51.690
Now, after selecting the maximum colors.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.810
The maximum weight for each colour, the maximum weight for each colour.

04:57.080 --> 05:01.040
What we have is we have it equal to the total really close to light.

05:01.490 --> 05:04.220
But when the total weight is equal to 12.

05:07.290 --> 05:07.530
Yeah.

05:07.680 --> 05:14.160
So when the total weight is equal to 12, but here you can see the knapsack capacity is 11 related N

05:14.160 --> 05:15.760
minus one naught eight.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.730
Because now I have other options too.

05:17.740 --> 05:20.180
I don't have to look for it.

05:20.190 --> 05:21.020
I can select tree.

05:21.510 --> 05:24.180
But what I'll do is I'll just three plus four plus three is.

05:27.470 --> 05:31.040
1108 and the knapsack capacity is 11.

05:31.430 --> 05:36.200
In this case guide, we were able to see that, yes, we can select some of options.

05:36.710 --> 05:37.910
But tell me one thing.

05:38.210 --> 05:40.060
I selected four, five, 3/1.

05:40.190 --> 05:41.000
So why don't I.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.440
Why did I select three?

05:42.440 --> 05:44.660
Why did I not select this two or this five?

05:45.680 --> 05:50.990
All this food aid, both of all these three options would have looked great.

05:51.650 --> 05:55.250
But the concerns may not be so valid.

05:55.250 --> 05:58.460
And that means what if instead of 11, we had ten.

05:59.490 --> 06:02.880
If we had turned in this for this fight, this result won't work.

06:03.660 --> 06:05.970
And if I select this tree.

06:07.150 --> 06:08.950
Instead of war, then also it won't work.

06:09.190 --> 06:14.200
Then again, I have three options, which is at the Select Board or select two or select this to eight.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.920
And when I select any one of them, it will work eight.

06:17.170 --> 06:20.350
But again, saying the same thing what if it was nine?

06:21.930 --> 06:27.790
So as you can see that there are so many cases which are being formulated over here because we can take

06:28.180 --> 06:30.310
any of those options which are available to us.

06:31.570 --> 06:38.620
And greedy won't work because let's say let's say instead of 40 selected to the LHC.

06:38.710 --> 06:39.070
Right.

06:39.610 --> 06:47.680
But what if the answer was, let's say, what if the answer was when it had four and some less number

06:47.680 --> 06:51.110
from the second color and some less number from detectable?

06:52.100 --> 06:53.240
It is kind of possible.

06:53.390 --> 06:59.210
I know it is not possible in this example statement, but it can be possible that if you are living

06:59.210 --> 07:04.970
an element in the greedy approach, that can be the final answer to trade because there are so many

07:04.970 --> 07:05.690
possibilities.

07:07.040 --> 07:12.010
So now what we do is we try a dynamic programming approach in this one.

07:12.140 --> 07:16.280
So here you can see that it is very related to this absurd sum problem.

07:16.850 --> 07:20.810
We have to formulate a particular sum which is less than equals to.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.390
This is absurd.

07:23.390 --> 07:23.840
Some problem.

07:23.840 --> 07:29.200
What we had is we have to find out, as a said, which is some exactly equal to the number.

07:29.300 --> 07:29.690
Right.

07:30.110 --> 07:35.690
And here what we can do is be what we have to do is we have to find out the summit, which is maximum

07:35.690 --> 07:36.200
possible.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.520
But then it goes to.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.750
X that's given to me.

07:40.530 --> 07:43.260
So, for example, let's take X to be equals to.

07:44.180 --> 07:44.520
And.

07:44.740 --> 07:47.480
And let me quickly write it later.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.190
This is these are decent values.

07:53.220 --> 07:58.090
And then later we have this last column also, and that is ten full.

07:58.860 --> 08:01.800
So some zero is never possible?

08:02.820 --> 08:08.850
Yeah, some zero is not possible because of all these weights, because the consensus is that we will

08:08.850 --> 08:12.540
be greater than equal to one into a two, and we don't have to worry about some zero.

08:13.080 --> 08:22.680
So now what I do is I will try to fill this deportable by saying that the first true the faster will.

08:23.340 --> 08:23.610
Okay.

08:23.610 --> 08:25.380
So what does a particular cell represent?

08:25.650 --> 08:26.970
Basically the state of the ATP.

08:26.970 --> 08:27.240
Right?

08:27.560 --> 08:27.780
So.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.640
So here what I can see is DB.

08:29.660 --> 08:30.540
I got my G.

08:31.590 --> 08:38.670
When I zero and James column represents that it's a boolean later let me right then also it's a boolean

08:38.670 --> 08:39.900
which represents whether.

08:42.110 --> 08:42.820
There's some.

08:43.780 --> 08:45.910
D It's possible.

08:48.190 --> 08:48.910
By using.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.160
Most Cyclers.

08:53.970 --> 08:55.940
I feel it's simple.

08:56.910 --> 09:02.730
So whether some days possibly if I use the first article as a tool right now, let's say I goes to one.

09:03.120 --> 09:07.890
So what is this one possible if I use these tones of only first color, which is two, three and four?

09:08.070 --> 09:10.800
So some that is possible is only two, three and four.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.080
Right now.

09:14.710 --> 09:16.150
Let's move to the second row.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.910
And what number does it represent?

09:18.910 --> 09:22.360
Whether something is possible if I use the first I colors, right?

09:22.570 --> 09:22.890
It is.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.520
Now if I use the first two colors.

09:24.820 --> 09:28.540
So here you can see that this is not possible.

09:28.870 --> 09:29.920
This is not possible.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.300
What about do here?

09:33.300 --> 09:34.950
Well, will this to be possible?

09:35.610 --> 09:35.940
No.

09:35.940 --> 09:36.270
Right.

09:36.270 --> 09:37.050
Because it is absurd.

09:37.050 --> 09:37.740
Some problem.

09:37.740 --> 09:41.280
If it is possible from some sub subset above, it will still be possible.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.020
But in this case, it's not true.

09:43.590 --> 09:48.270
This one means that some two is possible by using one only.

09:48.270 --> 09:48.540
Right.

09:48.900 --> 09:52.800
But in the end, what we want, we want exactly one element from each color.

09:52.830 --> 09:54.780
We can't say that we are not picking two.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.550
We have to pick.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.760
A storm from Canada.

09:59.610 --> 10:00.210
That means.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.840
I guess if I did possible.

10:03.840 --> 10:08.520
If I eliminated accommodate is only possible if.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.810
DP i.e. minus one and j minus.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.930
W let's call it.

10:19.930 --> 10:20.200
Okay.

10:21.130 --> 10:23.530
If I minus one demon's w case possible.

10:23.530 --> 10:25.420
And what is this k this k.

10:25.780 --> 10:27.790
Okay, let me explain it to you that way.

10:28.420 --> 10:28.690
Yeah.

10:29.860 --> 10:37.960
So for this to raise, if I want to use this color to I so can I see that this color too can come after

10:37.960 --> 10:39.280
this particular.

10:40.880 --> 10:46.940
Value, which is above or above some two, and the current color, too.

10:47.450 --> 10:49.250
And it can come after this.

10:50.230 --> 10:52.090
It can also come after this.

10:53.140 --> 10:58.390
Basically, these three values, which are four, five and six, can have a.

10:59.930 --> 11:00.980
Low value aid.

11:00.980 --> 11:02.210
How can it have a true value?

11:02.210 --> 11:09.500
Because this can be made by using by taking you to this fight can be made by using three, two, and

11:09.500 --> 11:12.350
this six can be made by using four to.

11:13.200 --> 11:13.600
Correct.

11:13.650 --> 11:15.060
That means exactly one from.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.340
Each color tells two.

11:18.360 --> 11:25.620
So now let's talk about this for if I want to use this color for that means two plus 4 to 6.

11:25.620 --> 11:31.950
It is already two, three plus 4 to 7 and four plus four is eight, eight.

11:32.160 --> 11:37.140
So all these other cells which are seven and eight cell.

11:37.260 --> 11:43.530
Now they will also give me two Y because three are okay because three plus 47 and four plus four, is

11:43.800 --> 11:45.140
it correct?

11:45.330 --> 11:53.100
So basically what I'm doing is for each cell, I'm just checking previously whether any of this is possible

11:53.470 --> 11:58.460
and in here w k this, this it has a weight rate.

11:58.470 --> 12:02.310
So these words are only the weights of the current row.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.060
That means if I use one element from the current row, is the previous value true or not?

12:09.960 --> 12:12.150
And I can use any of these one element.

12:12.930 --> 12:13.590
So basically.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.900
Okay, let me fill it for the third row as well.

12:16.290 --> 12:22.740
Walter Reuther, you can see the let's see if I use value to go for it for what's true.

12:23.040 --> 12:26.490
That means I can make a sum of what by using plus two colors.

12:26.670 --> 12:28.650
That means I cannot do after it.

12:29.070 --> 12:32.400
Which is the storm, which is way to include three, right?

12:32.670 --> 12:33.600
If I had to after it.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.410
This will be true.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.170
Six will be true.

12:35.170 --> 12:35.370
Right.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.180
This means two plus two +28.

12:38.570 --> 12:38.970
And.

12:40.350 --> 12:41.860
What about this seven?

12:42.420 --> 12:46.470
So the seven getting me only possible if this five is possible.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.400
So it's possible.

12:47.940 --> 12:50.700
This is can only be possible if this six is possible.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.530
It's possible eight.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.320
This nine gives all the possible because seven is possible.

12:55.320 --> 12:59.250
And the standard odds of what will be scored because they say it is possible that you can see.

13:00.450 --> 13:03.630
This is four plus five plus two is 11.

13:03.630 --> 13:03.980
Right.

13:04.440 --> 13:05.260
And.

13:05.700 --> 13:06.210
Okay.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.080
So.

13:09.530 --> 13:11.180
I we are getting this now.

13:11.540 --> 13:17.960
There's one thing that actually I'm I think it's it's missed that is what I did not update the value

13:17.960 --> 13:23.330
for this five rates of all five is nine and three plus five is eight, which is already filled and two

13:23.330 --> 13:24.530
plus five is seven.

13:24.680 --> 13:24.930
Yeah.

13:24.980 --> 13:25.610
No, it's correct.

13:26.150 --> 13:27.920
And now again you can see it is one one, one one.

13:27.930 --> 13:28.220
Right.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.100
So here you can easily see that for any cell.

13:32.190 --> 13:40.740
What I can do is I can try to place any of the current colours stones made, and if I place any of the

13:40.740 --> 13:47.490
current stones there, I can then directly check whether w minus one and D-minus w is possible or not.

13:48.450 --> 13:50.370
So what will the time complexity here?

13:50.760 --> 13:51.390
What any.

13:51.600 --> 13:51.840
Okay.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.130
So how many cells are there?

13:53.820 --> 14:02.110
There are some which is x cross the colours and across m cells and put all these X across m cells.

14:02.130 --> 14:03.840
I'm kind of.

14:06.430 --> 14:11.770
Checking backwards, basically checking this W.K. backwards for all the instruments.

14:12.610 --> 14:17.590
So it is according to him in doing so because ultimately.

14:18.280 --> 14:18.670
Okay.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.080
Hmm.

14:21.110 --> 14:28.760
So I might not necessarily multiply and whatever because, you know, we are not checking for all of

14:29.390 --> 14:30.950
we are not checking for all zeros.

14:30.950 --> 14:31.310
Right.

14:31.340 --> 14:32.030
That means.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.340
What all this is.

14:34.340 --> 14:37.970
I'm not checking for all the and all this on trade.

14:39.310 --> 14:40.840
What a particular rule.

14:40.990 --> 14:43.690
We are just checking for that particular.

14:44.770 --> 14:45.400
Colors.

14:46.440 --> 14:46.910
Students.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.460
Mean, we're not checking for all these students again and again for all these cells.

14:50.460 --> 14:58.350
So it might not be good if if I multiply it by an eight, but according to him and I can see it is explained

14:58.350 --> 14:58.890
to him.

15:00.450 --> 15:02.580
Can we say a lesson because.

15:03.630 --> 15:03.930
Yeah.

15:03.930 --> 15:05.130
I think we can replace him.

15:05.890 --> 15:12.630
Okay, so explain to him why this is whose values we are going to fail and for those we are just checking

15:13.170 --> 15:13.860
it for.

15:14.610 --> 15:17.490
And don't I think we can't.

15:17.490 --> 15:20.280
Six into implosion eight though.

15:21.060 --> 15:24.570
And we can't also say anything to him in doing that.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.420
That would also not be true because.

15:28.630 --> 15:28.960
Let's.

15:29.290 --> 15:34.690
Okay, let's just say that for a second rule or second rule for all this is what I'm doing is I'm trying

15:34.690 --> 15:39.910
to figure out what all these three stones eight.

15:40.420 --> 15:45.460
So, okay, let me write it like this then maybe let's go deeper in due time.

15:45.460 --> 15:46.600
Complexity, analysis it.

15:47.540 --> 15:49.010
Eight for any role.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.150
How many sales are there.

15:50.490 --> 15:50.670
What?

15:50.690 --> 15:51.590
And you know, I believe.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.540
And X.

15:55.240 --> 16:01.990
That means X columns and for all these excels, what I'm doing is I'm actually trying to figure out

16:01.990 --> 16:04.780
for all these particular stones of the same color.

16:05.050 --> 16:05.320
Right.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.980
So let's say city represents this drawing of color, right?

16:09.250 --> 16:10.980
That means X into essay.

16:11.850 --> 16:15.830
It would be my complexity right where I was from.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.600
I goes from one to.

16:20.220 --> 16:26.940
M Eric to x x into s1x into s2 x into s3x into his foot and so on.

16:27.760 --> 16:31.270
Now, this is a good complexity and.

16:33.450 --> 16:33.780
Yeah.

16:34.380 --> 16:37.140
So here, what I can do is.

16:38.020 --> 16:46.570
I can pick x out x outside and I can see I goes from one to m summation of x eight as a eight.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.670
And what will be the summation of essay?

16:49.090 --> 16:54.100
How many students for a particular color will be there?

16:54.100 --> 16:54.460
So.

16:56.260 --> 17:00.810
Nicole Alexis I began say yes.

17:00.890 --> 17:06.570
So submission of essay is nothing but an ode to how many stones of particular color are there.

17:06.570 --> 17:10.290
And if I submit from one to him, that means all these tones of all the golden.

17:10.350 --> 17:17.700
That means, as one does as to this tree, which is nothing but and and to the complexity of the solution

17:17.700 --> 17:18.930
is nothing but Xanadu.

17:19.470 --> 17:21.300
And and what is ex into here.

17:22.310 --> 17:30.170
To exist and this by Ford and we can see that and is and it so it goes to ten is to about six.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.070
Correct.

17:32.220 --> 17:36.690
So the time complexity here is a very tricky part, but I hope you understand this.

17:37.110 --> 17:40.140
And the second part here is the code, which is, again, very easy.

17:40.470 --> 17:42.150
I am not coding it.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.500
I'll provide you the code.

17:43.500 --> 17:52.830
But and and there's just one challenge, a problem that I want to give you that try this using Richard's

17:53.640 --> 17:54.050
right.

17:54.060 --> 17:56.400
Try using Richard because invitational.

17:56.400 --> 18:02.460
What you will have to do is you need to write to the bits that if you can see it, let's see if I were

18:02.460 --> 18:08.370
bitten, I will write it for every stone of a colour and then for all the values that I get, I have

18:08.370 --> 18:09.070
to dig there.

18:09.070 --> 18:09.300
Not.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.210
I'm okay.

18:11.230 --> 18:13.540
You'll realize it only if you called it.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.160
But I'm leaving the quote to you.

18:15.730 --> 18:17.740
Well, so thank you all.

18:18.040 --> 18:18.700
In the next part.
