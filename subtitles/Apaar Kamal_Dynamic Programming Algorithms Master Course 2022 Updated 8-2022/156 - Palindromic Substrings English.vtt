00:00.620 --> 00:03.080
Now we can quickly cause some problems.

00:03.260 --> 00:04.250
So this is another.

00:04.760 --> 00:10.160
And he likes and dislikes are very good is another very easy problem for you which is given a string

00:10.160 --> 00:12.140
is right in the middle palindromic substring.

00:13.310 --> 00:18.290
And the constraints are very less restoring to and and square solution can always work.

00:19.610 --> 00:22.070
So how can I all this?

00:22.490 --> 00:23.630
Of course I will not call it.

00:23.930 --> 00:26.510
But there is one thing about palindromes that you should know.

00:26.540 --> 00:27.680
I will go to the next problem.

00:28.490 --> 00:32.580
And the next problem that I'll be taking is this one longest palindromic subsequent.

00:32.870 --> 00:35.390
It is also a good one, but this is also a good one.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.560
Here these are fact about palindrome.

00:39.560 --> 00:40.400
What is a palindrome?

00:40.410 --> 00:47.390
First of all, you almost notice that a character, if I reverse it, if I string near the string,

00:48.020 --> 00:49.940
it is equal to the reverse of.

00:50.780 --> 00:51.230
Itself.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.310
If I read it friend or they read it back, they are both equal.

00:55.610 --> 00:57.260
What example this did?

01:00.460 --> 01:01.540
It's a palindrome date.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.070
22022022422022022.

01:06.530 --> 01:12.430
It was a very rescinded and but we were married on this date and this is a very special.

01:12.580 --> 01:15.700
Even if you remove zero, then the date is really very special.

01:15.730 --> 01:15.960
Eight.

01:16.730 --> 01:18.730
It's always reminded it.

01:21.250 --> 01:25.510
So I hope, you know now what is a palindrome and what words, especially for palindrome.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.830
Let's say I was doing a, b, b, b.

01:30.910 --> 01:38.140
If so, these are this name, which is Aurora, and this is the palindromic name I buy, because then

01:38.440 --> 01:40.900
if I read it from front or back, it will.

01:43.470 --> 01:44.160
Wrong as they seem.

01:44.790 --> 01:46.230
Similarly, what about this?

01:47.010 --> 01:49.260
These are palindromes of alternate eight.

01:50.140 --> 01:54.880
If I wanted up didn't in Newfoundland, then I can simply make this as a continuum of people.

01:56.770 --> 01:57.930
I will not cause this problem.

01:57.940 --> 02:00.370
It's very easy if you have to find out whether.

02:01.380 --> 02:03.960
Knowing this, what I can do is I can have an end square solution.

02:04.650 --> 02:09.120
So what you can do is you can try for all possible substance rate.

02:09.540 --> 02:09.990
Whether.

02:11.470 --> 02:12.940
For all possible upswings.

02:13.510 --> 02:15.310
All possible upswings.

02:15.970 --> 02:16.450
Let's see.

02:17.020 --> 02:19.300
I'm seeing whether I do g.

02:19.660 --> 02:21.150
It means of strength from my two days.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.180
A palindrome or not.

02:22.750 --> 02:23.040
Let's.

02:23.170 --> 02:24.520
That is what my DP represent.

02:25.350 --> 02:29.200
It will be true if it is up random false otherwise.

02:29.960 --> 02:35.170
That means if suffering from ideology is a palindrome, this page eligible palindrome is that the last

02:35.170 --> 02:38.290
characters are same and in middle string.

02:40.700 --> 02:41.690
Is, again, a palindrome.

02:42.920 --> 02:43.180
Right.

02:43.730 --> 02:49.580
Well, some of you might say that, uh, last year it doesn't seem second last year, same third last

02:49.580 --> 02:49.670
year.

02:50.210 --> 02:56.000
But, you know, we are talking recursive here when we talk because if we see a dip, i.e., our margin

02:56.030 --> 02:59.750
is a palindrome, only if essay is equal to.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.740
SJ that means the first in the last year because I see.

03:05.150 --> 03:12.170
And epi i.e. minus one comma DPA plus one comma j minus one.

03:12.410 --> 03:18.530
Is that basically if this is a parent and these characters are same, then it is also open and this

03:18.530 --> 03:25.730
is anomalous in political evolution and you can very easily call it I just there are two basic cases

03:25.730 --> 03:27.890
in this and just remember that don't get confused.

03:27.890 --> 03:30.560
The first base case is when this thing is a fraudulent.

03:30.710 --> 03:36.020
But if I'm checking whether this is a palindrome or this is a palindrome, and I simply reach when it

03:36.020 --> 03:37.730
is a fraudulent rate.

03:38.540 --> 03:39.890
And the second best case is when it is.

03:40.020 --> 03:44.750
Even then, my best case will hit two different mixes.

03:45.200 --> 03:52.160
Otherwise, when I mean you can handle it and it's pretty easy, it's not pretty, it's very easy.

03:53.240 --> 04:01.550
So what you can do is you can go for from a zero to in and for all the zero to end of the day you will

04:01.550 --> 04:05.720
start from like eight for all G which starts from my ego.

04:05.720 --> 04:10.790
Still in eight you can just say answer plus equals to DP I comma.

04:11.320 --> 04:15.130
If I if it is a palindrome, it will be one otherwise be.

04:17.320 --> 04:17.710
Police.

04:18.070 --> 04:21.310
So this should be very easy and you know the complexity of the solution.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.770
UPDATE How many state and square states?

04:24.240 --> 04:26.260
What is the complexity of this far look and square.

04:26.260 --> 04:28.210
So we'll add them, not multiply them.

04:28.210 --> 04:29.800
They will add them because.

04:30.740 --> 04:31.940
And quite states there.

04:32.390 --> 04:36.380
You can do a precomputation as well and then you can add it or you can do it this way.

04:36.590 --> 04:37.460
Both of them books.

04:38.900 --> 04:45.930
Well, I hope you realize this and then see you in the next question, which is longest but terms of

04:46.020 --> 04:46.590
subsequent.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.340
It's also a.

04:48.220 --> 04:49.090
Really the problem.

04:50.000 --> 04:50.420
Thank you.
