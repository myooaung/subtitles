WEBVTT

00:00.670 --> 00:01.300
And everyone.

00:01.510 --> 00:07.240
Last time we left this problem on the simple thing that.

00:09.180 --> 00:10.780
We were able to count ordered.

00:11.140 --> 00:13.780
It was very simple or an ordered said.

00:15.390 --> 00:23.550
We derive this a normal reconciliation, which is if I take a minimum that okay, now tell me how many,

00:23.550 --> 00:29.970
you know, how many we like in partition and if the minimum element in the partition is this man made.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.150
So that was what we store.

00:33.930 --> 00:42.900
And then we I also saw this old episode edition online and I just wanted to know how or why is this

00:42.900 --> 00:43.650
working right?

00:43.650 --> 00:45.060
Because there was no explanation.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.680
But now I have figured out that how or why is it working?

00:49.980 --> 00:54.900
And from starting from here, you reaching here.

00:55.860 --> 00:58.650
Is a very tricky process, right?

00:58.680 --> 01:01.320
So just watch this video, their own risk.

01:01.650 --> 01:05.250
But if you do watch this video, you'll realize one thing that.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.150
Dynamic Programming release.

01:08.670 --> 01:13.350
Dynamic programming state is the same, but the recurrence relation is different.

01:14.410 --> 01:16.030
Eight to having a different record.

01:16.030 --> 01:20.590
A different record in relation will give me the same answer.

01:21.070 --> 01:22.690
Eight So let me repeat this fact.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.480
Initially what we heard is we had this.

01:26.290 --> 01:28.000
Oh, yeah, let's go back.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.160
You put this one eight and you count unordered.

01:32.170 --> 01:34.480
What I did was let me quickly.

01:35.110 --> 01:35.560
I did.

01:36.260 --> 01:37.390
We just did nothing.

01:37.390 --> 01:41.440
But we set up a minimum comma and is what?

01:42.640 --> 01:48.010
The number of ways of partitioning in such that minimum element is.

01:49.770 --> 01:51.510
Minimum element.

01:52.790 --> 01:54.050
It's men.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.350
Made to the minimum element.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.530
It should be meant.

01:57.820 --> 02:01.360
8 million element is not actually mean.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.470
The minimum.

02:03.130 --> 02:03.400
Yeah.

02:03.910 --> 02:06.550
Now what I have is I have a very.

02:07.480 --> 02:14.980
The American installation made and this installation sees that the number of partitions.

02:15.010 --> 02:15.410
Okay.

02:15.430 --> 02:15.690
Okay.

02:15.790 --> 02:21.150
So before moving forward, let me just quickly write this whole relation.

02:21.160 --> 02:26.560
The current solution that we got in was equals to let get let's get back here.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.800
It was it goes to count and ordered, which is again.

02:30.830 --> 02:32.060
Commissioner D.P..

02:33.860 --> 02:39.350
I.e. coma and minus, i.e. and various i.e. goes from doing.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.880
And how did we reach to this reconciliation?

02:43.910 --> 02:45.320
We said it if minimum is.

02:46.220 --> 02:46.490
Yeah.

02:46.610 --> 02:50.240
So we said that the minimum element is midnight.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.890
So this will be a little off.

02:51.970 --> 03:01.490
We are we explained this the correct way would be that number of partitions such that the minimum element

03:01.490 --> 03:04.970
is at least min.

03:08.370 --> 03:14.190
What is the difference between the previous thing that I wrote and this, the explanation, the definition?

03:14.250 --> 03:15.810
This state is very similar.

03:16.050 --> 03:18.660
We are not saying that the minimum element will be one.

03:19.230 --> 03:22.470
If minimum is one, we are saying that can be at least one.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.620
That means the minimum element will be greater than or equal to one.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.050
So that's why we were getting the final answers here.

03:29.970 --> 03:36.720
So what is of one eye when I means the number of ways of partitioning, i.e. such that the minimum element

03:36.720 --> 03:38.820
is at least one made.

03:39.030 --> 03:43.800
So minimum element can be either itself eight or I minus one, or I managed to.

03:43.800 --> 03:44.820
It can be one also.

03:45.030 --> 03:48.880
But I'm not saying that a minimum element is one is at least one.

03:49.140 --> 03:49.390
Good.

03:49.830 --> 03:53.970
I you saw the difference and this is the new yeah.

03:54.030 --> 03:58.530
This is the resolution that we already quoted a different count and ordered.

03:59.810 --> 04:02.350
I'm and in my Nissan, we are going to learn.

04:02.360 --> 04:02.690
Right.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.580
So how did we derive that?

04:04.580 --> 04:08.330
We simply said that DP min and is equal to.

04:10.210 --> 04:10.510
Yeah.

04:10.540 --> 04:12.490
So what all options do ahead?

04:12.730 --> 04:18.250
And the the minimum number can be min so it can be and minus min.

04:18.610 --> 04:18.820
Yeah.

04:18.820 --> 04:20.740
So that's what, that's what's happening here.

04:22.360 --> 04:28.300
It can be then and minus min like figured out the number of years of dividing and minus minimum and

04:28.300 --> 04:29.590
minimum +18.

04:29.950 --> 04:33.220
That's what is happening in this is a recursive relation over here.

04:34.880 --> 04:43.100
Well that now the minimum element is I and I've already taken into consideration but now figure out

04:43.350 --> 04:47.630
what is what is the what are the partition numbers for the other relation.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.370
And we saw that this took eight.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.370
But now what I'll do is I'll have a different recursive relation, but this seems to it.

04:55.970 --> 04:59.180
Let's just assume we have deep min and eight and.

05:00.180 --> 05:05.670
I believe what we were doing is that we were running and i.e. from end to end we are saying that, okay,

05:05.670 --> 05:07.260
now tell me the answer.

05:07.260 --> 05:09.840
If I is the new man.

05:10.830 --> 05:16.410
That means they are telling me number two is of partitioning and minus eight if I is the minimum element

05:16.770 --> 05:16.930
eight.

05:17.070 --> 05:22.580
But now what I will do is I will not say if I is the minimum, I will see that.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.210
And just divided into two parts.

05:26.540 --> 05:27.070
I did.

05:33.250 --> 05:33.350
Yeah.

05:33.430 --> 05:38.560
I just simply say I just decided to do a little part and I just see that DP Many.

05:39.890 --> 05:43.430
Minion is nothing but if m.n..

05:44.850 --> 05:49.380
It's taken as the minimum element or if mean is not taken as the minimum.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.930
I mean, it's not considered.

05:53.510 --> 05:54.320
Minimum element.

05:55.540 --> 05:57.820
Just trying to understand this part is very important.

05:59.140 --> 06:04.130
But instead of saying other meanings, there are men plus one woman plus three.

06:04.150 --> 06:06.100
So on Dillon, they two basic ladies.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.600
Men, men plus one.

06:08.730 --> 06:09.670
I mean, plus two.

06:10.640 --> 06:16.420
And so until and I'm saying this is minimum all this is minimum or this is minimum.

06:16.430 --> 06:22.640
So until and I'm just saying now or when you recursively say I'm just saying and then mine is the new.

06:24.240 --> 06:31.920
Minister Green as the new minimum element or it is not taken as the new minimum element.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.930
Basically, I'm dividing it into two parts.

06:33.930 --> 06:40.020
No issue of dividing into mean to but eight so that it is taken as minimum or it is not taken as.

06:41.210 --> 06:48.050
But tell me if this value min is taken as the minimum element, then what should be my recursive relation?

06:48.260 --> 06:52.430
It is the minimum element and I am considering it as the minimum element.

06:52.430 --> 06:54.440
I know that means I'm actually using it.

06:55.610 --> 07:01.130
So my state will just depend on the lookup yet if I'm using this min.

07:02.070 --> 07:06.420
Then the next menu element can also be mean and.

07:07.270 --> 07:08.800
I'm using them in.

07:09.280 --> 07:14.430
That means Minister Garnier so the number and will now be and minus when.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.540
I hope you're getting this, which is nothing.

07:17.540 --> 07:22.420
But it says that if I'm considering mine, that means if it is taken into consideration, that means

07:22.420 --> 07:23.230
this first case.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.600
That means d b I got mine minus r u where I is equal to men.

07:28.480 --> 07:28.610
Eight.

07:28.720 --> 07:37.450
In the above case, a two wheeler deep in min gomer and minus mint a that is considered min as the value

07:37.810 --> 07:40.840
and and minus will be the remaining partition that we want.

07:41.590 --> 07:46.990
Secondly, moving on to the second part, which is if it's not considered as the minimum element, that

07:46.990 --> 07:51.970
means all these other cases combined mean is not considered as the minimum element.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.910
Then what will be considered as the minimum element mean plus one?

07:55.930 --> 08:02.470
So we can simply say that if main plus one is considered as the minimum element and Andrew means as

08:02.470 --> 08:02.800
it is.

08:03.760 --> 08:08.290
So the first case is if mean is taken and the second cases if Min is not taken.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.500
That's why I'm not subjecting anything from it and remains as it is.

08:11.710 --> 08:17.590
And tell me the answer if min is not taken, if it is not considered as the minimum element.

08:18.760 --> 08:22.270
So this is a new recursive relations to what I'll simply say.

08:22.270 --> 08:25.510
I had implicitly been in coma and is equals to the P.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.020
Men, comma and minus men, less BP men plus one comma.

08:34.020 --> 08:39.270
And that I know what we're doing is we have the same state, but we have different ways of.

08:41.680 --> 08:47.590
Making the recurrence relation the status seem, but base of making the recurrence relation is different.

08:48.310 --> 08:48.560
Good.

08:48.910 --> 08:51.220
So now what we have got is we have nothing.

08:52.060 --> 08:53.150
And is the p.

08:53.170 --> 08:54.660
I mean this if you can.

08:54.810 --> 08:56.320
It's very simple because of relation.

08:57.010 --> 08:59.440
So added we are moving one step ahead.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.540
We are seeing we are not taking mean or we are taking mean.

09:01.780 --> 09:05.050
I just two options not taking min taking eight.

09:05.310 --> 09:06.340
So here we're taking min.

09:06.340 --> 09:07.980
Here we're not taking full.

09:08.410 --> 09:10.150
So now what?

09:10.960 --> 09:11.230
Yeah.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.030
So now let's do one thing.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.410
Let's quickly code this.

09:14.410 --> 09:16.150
And then what we'll do is we'll just.

09:17.860 --> 09:23.020
I also feel that and show you how it's looking so that I know, of course you can see that if I convert

09:23.020 --> 09:31.180
I mean, if I convert this deep into ions, I can simply say BPI equals to DP, i.e. comma d minus I

09:32.020 --> 09:33.820
and the less.

09:34.820 --> 09:37.550
If B I plus one comma.

09:38.220 --> 09:39.260
Yeah, right.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.590
So if I were converting all of this into challenges.

09:44.130 --> 09:44.410
Yep.

09:44.850 --> 09:49.020
So now you can easily, like, see the decade's evolution here, which is.

09:50.300 --> 09:52.460
In terms of changes, will it mean quickly?

09:52.460 --> 09:56.180
Could it exceed our second approach rate?

09:56.720 --> 09:58.730
And let's see if it works or not?

09:59.280 --> 10:03.160
Well, firstly, what I'll do is I'll just simply comment this solution rate.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.490
No, I mean, you don't.

10:05.670 --> 10:11.430
And we will have and and will have this, which is count on ordered.

10:12.330 --> 10:12.660
Right.

10:12.720 --> 10:18.030
So it just let's just you name it two and this will be meaning is nothing but.

10:18.900 --> 10:20.700
This is on the move this far.

10:20.710 --> 10:20.970
Look.

10:21.970 --> 10:22.270
Eight.

10:23.270 --> 10:26.000
So your answer is equals to nothing.

10:26.000 --> 10:26.840
Where DP?

10:28.320 --> 10:33.630
Min bama and minus min that we saw plus.

10:35.170 --> 10:44.650
Min plus 1ap min plus one gamma and other min is increasing or and is decreasing rate and here will

10:44.650 --> 10:47.920
simply run the answer relative of one more base case.

10:47.950 --> 10:51.070
So we know that end is decreasing and min is increasing.

10:51.070 --> 10:59.680
So if minimum this value if minimum is greater than eight, so whatever if minimum is greater than and

11:00.400 --> 11:03.010
then the answer is not possible, we understand zero.

11:03.850 --> 11:08.050
Of course, if the minimum value is greater than in the number that has to be partitioned, it's not

11:08.050 --> 11:08.860
possible late.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.440
We will simply add it n0 because that's not a particular.

11:12.450 --> 11:13.320
But they'd be born.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.380
And can there be any other basis?

11:17.310 --> 11:17.640
Yeah.

11:17.880 --> 11:18.570
What if.

11:19.290 --> 11:22.440
If minimum is equal to in.

11:22.860 --> 11:26.670
If minimum is equal to end, that means it's in the number is five in the minimum elements.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.430
That means there's only one possible way which is five.

11:29.430 --> 11:36.000
It'd simply return one eight between builders ones and limit cigarettes, giving us the correct output

11:36.000 --> 11:38.220
or not bound on ordered.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.130
So minimum will be one and we'll have this.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.500
I only issue.

11:42.510 --> 11:43.620
Let me copy this.

11:48.420 --> 11:50.030
And let's call it who?

11:50.700 --> 11:52.050
I wouldn't memorize it right now.

11:52.140 --> 11:53.460
You can memorize it, but let me.

11:53.460 --> 11:53.850
I'm just.

11:53.850 --> 11:55.320
I just want to quickly check.

11:56.280 --> 11:56.640
Sorry.

11:57.060 --> 11:57.440
Deep.

11:59.130 --> 12:00.630
We stayed here.

12:03.100 --> 12:03.870
Featured here.

12:08.660 --> 12:10.100
So what is our reward?

12:10.130 --> 12:10.790
We got one.

12:10.790 --> 12:13.220
One, two, two, one, one, two, three, five, seven.

12:13.580 --> 12:18.590
So you can see that this above approach is also giving us the right answer.

12:18.590 --> 12:24.140
And this lure approach and this second approach that we discussed today is also giving us the exact

12:24.140 --> 12:24.920
same answer.

12:25.280 --> 12:31.550
This is the only difference between both these approaches is that I'm using a forward look inside a

12:31.890 --> 12:35.450
2D DP function, but here I'm not using any of the four loops.

12:35.720 --> 12:40.140
I'm just having a 2D function and it is calling two times eight.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.910
So inside the workings of one only.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.540
But here the work was off.

12:44.540 --> 12:46.370
And if I memorize it.

12:47.450 --> 12:47.810
If I.

12:49.550 --> 12:53.690
If I memorize it, then what will be the complexity of this function?

12:53.720 --> 12:58.430
It will be off and into an woven square from woven q.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.500
We have these.

13:01.370 --> 13:06.890
Off end square state by just reducing the number of calls that we are going to make.

13:07.250 --> 13:10.370
Basically, this is what is called optimal substructure.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.670
Of course, this was also a good substructure.

13:13.670 --> 13:15.800
It was also giving us a right answer.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.170
But this was not an optimal substructure.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.570
But this is an optimal substructure.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.510
Eight Optimal means not less, not more.

13:24.230 --> 13:26.870
And I think this is just a perfect substructure.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.350
So let's do one thing.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.750
Let's just fill out the table.

13:32.750 --> 13:36.950
According to this technical translation that we have got, this debate that goes for debate committee,

13:36.950 --> 13:37.580
A-minus, A-plus.

13:37.580 --> 13:40.010
DP, A-plus, one committee vote.

13:40.970 --> 13:42.920
So let me insert a table.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.590
That's seven across seven people.

13:46.990 --> 13:47.290
Okay.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.320
And you give me 1/2.

13:52.440 --> 13:52.680
It.

13:52.680 --> 13:53.420
Me?

13:53.630 --> 13:53.840
Yeah.

13:54.710 --> 14:03.080
And let me date the values, you know, one, two, 34560123, four, five, six.

14:03.530 --> 14:06.150
Now, you all know that what's happening in jeopardy.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.320
So let's say if I'm worried about this.

14:09.960 --> 14:14.200
Eight This is three coma for this is dependent on DP.

14:14.210 --> 14:17.870
I go, madam, I do I go margin minus eight, which is.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.940
The Goma, four minus three is one.

14:22.940 --> 14:26.210
Plus you'd be A-plus, Wendy, which is Barack Obama.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.450
What that means the next.

14:28.460 --> 14:29.870
Well, here and.

14:31.060 --> 14:33.240
The coma, one which is decent.

14:34.020 --> 14:36.210
So it is only dependent on these two sales.

14:36.630 --> 14:41.760
As you can see for any sale, I want to sell it from the left and I want to sell from you, don't I?

14:42.090 --> 14:44.940
That means I can start filling this up.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.970
I can start filling this table from down.

14:48.780 --> 14:53.580
So what I will do is I'll try to I just start filling this table from here.

14:53.850 --> 14:59.040
I just go this way and then I'll go this way because you are not ready to fill this.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.290
I want the value of this.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.690
That's where these in order that I need to follow to fill this table.

15:04.270 --> 15:07.780
Well, and why am I feeling left when I am not going right?

15:07.800 --> 15:11.420
Because for any of the value I want the previous value in the same group.

15:11.670 --> 15:16.000
That's why I'm going left and I'm going up so that we have good values computing.

15:16.440 --> 15:16.660
Good.

15:17.180 --> 15:19.980
I'm feeling this all because I want you to replace one thing.

15:20.340 --> 15:21.840
And yeah.

15:22.390 --> 15:25.050
So here what we have is we have six and.

15:25.410 --> 15:26.760
Okay, what were the base cases?

15:27.090 --> 15:29.490
The base case is simple and it goes to zero return one.

15:30.420 --> 15:35.970
So what is and easy is is mean and and is the right.

15:36.210 --> 15:37.290
That's what I have replaced.

15:38.400 --> 15:44.520
If an is equal to zero and when that means and is there indeed zero return when that means the first

15:45.330 --> 15:46.730
column will be one.

15:46.740 --> 15:49.230
So I'm just filling it like base cases.

15:49.590 --> 15:57.570
And the second is if my new English 200 and where it is minimum equals two in so many ways i n and is

15:57.570 --> 16:01.680
d so if I is equals to the written one eight, let me fill that as well.

16:03.450 --> 16:04.800
Yeah, it should be this one.

16:04.810 --> 16:07.920
But now let's just fill this last straw.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.290
What is the value of this?

16:10.320 --> 16:13.260
It is six comma one needs according to this reconciliation.

16:14.070 --> 16:17.010
Don't forget, I'm just filling this table by this reconciliation.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.160
So, four, six, comma, one.

16:20.160 --> 16:20.690
What I need.

16:20.700 --> 16:22.770
I need six comma.

16:23.800 --> 16:24.240
Um.

16:24.880 --> 16:25.210
Okay.

16:25.330 --> 16:30.430
So this accounting also, if minimum is greater, then and then zero.

16:30.430 --> 16:33.310
That means if I is greater than g i le10 zero.

16:33.580 --> 16:34.030
That means.

16:35.900 --> 16:40.640
If the raw number is greater than the column number, I just returned zero.

16:40.650 --> 16:40.940
Right.

16:40.940 --> 16:44.930
So this should be zero zero because six comma two is greater than

16:45.620 --> 16:53.750
00000000000008.

16:54.190 --> 16:59.960
I add all these zeros because of this condition that I use greater than it, then it is simple zero,

16:59.960 --> 17:00.260
right?

17:00.530 --> 17:05.150
Because we all know that if the minimum element greater than the answer is not possible.

17:05.480 --> 17:06.980
Now we are just worried about this.

17:06.980 --> 17:07.370
Six.

17:08.790 --> 17:09.600
Six, comma six.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.320
So we know six.

17:10.320 --> 17:13.340
CUOMO Six is one because of this case, which is the base case.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.330
Anyone's equals when there's only one way.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.870
Now, let's talk about this cell, which is five, comma, five.

17:19.380 --> 17:21.120
What if I go a five again?

17:21.120 --> 17:23.010
The so would be one because it's a base case.

17:23.580 --> 17:24.690
What about cell five?

17:24.710 --> 17:27.420
Commerce six, five, five, comma six.

17:27.420 --> 17:29.370
Depends on its cosmetics.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.050
Firstly, let me write.

17:33.450 --> 17:36.150
Five Coma six depends on how you go.

17:36.150 --> 17:37.830
Margin minus one, which is five comma.

17:38.890 --> 17:39.430
D-minus.

17:39.610 --> 17:40.570
What is D-minus?

17:40.570 --> 17:42.850
I in this case, x minus five, which is fine.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.360
So it depends on five comma one, which is zero.

17:46.420 --> 17:50.760
We can see five going when is zero less epa plus one g.

17:50.770 --> 17:51.910
Which is nothing but.

17:52.940 --> 17:53.170
Six.

17:53.230 --> 17:53.810
Coma six.

17:55.150 --> 17:56.980
So here we have one plus zero.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.480
That means these two cells, right?

17:58.540 --> 18:03.520
Six coma, six and five coma, zero five coma when it is zero plus one.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.450
And this will give me.

18:05.660 --> 18:09.800
When similarly, let's talk about this, which is working on this case now.

18:10.080 --> 18:10.880
What about for them?

18:10.890 --> 18:16.820
If I would come off, I was dependent on we all know when one settled down, which is five, comma,

18:16.820 --> 18:17.150
five.

18:19.070 --> 18:19.350
But.

18:20.230 --> 18:20.490
Yeah.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.230
Five Goma, five and four Goma five.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.750
Those are dependent on four.

18:25.750 --> 18:29.830
Goma, five minus four, which is one which is for Goma one.

18:32.860 --> 18:39.850
Four coma, five minus one, one one up for coma, five minus four, which is almost eight.

18:40.060 --> 18:41.080
So it is zero plus.

18:43.820 --> 18:44.060
Yeah.

18:44.060 --> 18:48.410
Let me quickly write it completely for my fave is four comma.

18:49.520 --> 18:55.550
Five minus four comma went to volume of one is zero and a down is one, so I'll have total one.

18:55.970 --> 18:57.530
Let's talk about this, which is four games.

18:57.550 --> 19:06.110
Six for games six is dependent on four comma, two plus are this by comma six.

19:06.590 --> 19:12.950
Eight before two is again zero and five sixes 182.

19:12.950 --> 19:18.860
Right now what we can see that actually everything is being filled as according to one, but we'll see

19:18.860 --> 19:21.580
that there will be some changing rate.

19:21.890 --> 19:23.210
So let me yeah.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.620
Let's get on with this.

19:24.620 --> 19:30.260
Trigonometry is when we know what about become a43 comma four is.

19:31.250 --> 19:34.100
You're down one +18.

19:34.310 --> 19:35.570
So it will be one.

19:36.140 --> 19:37.070
What about three, comma?

19:37.070 --> 19:37.460
Five.

19:37.490 --> 19:38.810
It is one plus three.

19:38.810 --> 19:39.450
Comma two.

19:39.800 --> 19:40.790
Again, one word about three.

19:40.790 --> 19:41.510
Comma six.

19:41.870 --> 19:44.650
It is one plus three to be.

19:44.990 --> 19:46.970
Now we see that I have a two over here.

19:48.060 --> 19:50.580
I hope you're getting this right now.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.530
What's the next rule?

19:52.560 --> 19:53.910
The next Ruiz is zero.

19:53.910 --> 19:55.590
And let me just quickly fill this now.

19:56.010 --> 19:56.610
It will be.

19:58.480 --> 20:02.980
One here, Tacoma two and now Tacoma trees 1 to 0.

20:04.360 --> 20:08.020
Or to come for this one plus one.

20:09.180 --> 20:11.460
Now this will be again, one plus one.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.560
And this will be two plus two for.

20:15.380 --> 20:15.740
Right.

20:16.220 --> 20:22.070
Finally, let's fill this table, because you know that this is the final answer that we need, because

20:22.490 --> 20:25.070
we we are just bringing answers for one committee.

20:25.580 --> 20:26.960
This is the room that we need.

20:26.960 --> 20:27.560
One committee.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.390
So, you know, one Goma.

20:29.390 --> 20:29.960
One is fine.

20:30.170 --> 20:31.780
What about one Goma two?

20:32.060 --> 20:38.270
It is nothing but this plus this eight, which is two, then this plus this is three.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.440
This plus this is five.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.520
This visit is a seven.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.730
And this place, this is 11, as you can easily see that.

20:45.140 --> 20:45.340
Yeah.

20:45.350 --> 20:46.160
Let me circle it.

20:46.160 --> 20:50.070
One line to the five seven.

20:50.090 --> 20:54.290
LEMON So I'm just I'm just here just, you know, filling up a table.

20:54.530 --> 20:56.300
And you can see we are getting the.

20:57.310 --> 20:57.660
Um.

20:58.730 --> 21:00.740
Acquired cities that we want.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.660
We are getting the cities that we want to.

21:03.350 --> 21:07.340
Well, if we are getting the cities that we want, then.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.250
It has to be a good act because of religion right now.

21:11.290 --> 21:13.100
What is the only thing that I want?

21:13.340 --> 21:17.840
I wanted to actually make you realize so that we can reach the second solution that we discussed.

21:18.230 --> 21:18.680
It is.

21:20.730 --> 21:22.560
The whole table here is not needed.

21:22.890 --> 21:23.950
I just.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.280
Just think about this.

21:25.290 --> 21:26.640
The whole table is not needed.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.010
Let me quickly make this.

21:30.090 --> 21:30.320
Yeah.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.080
So this is.

21:33.850 --> 21:36.010
You know, they fought and he said, what I want.

21:36.010 --> 21:38.440
I want something on the left of it.

21:39.360 --> 21:43.020
It means team ruin live and I want this, which is just down of it.

21:43.500 --> 21:47.910
We saw this is just a down sell and this is the sale on the left of it in the same row.

21:48.480 --> 21:54.960
So let me initially fill this with 100000 and one.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.170
Well now.

21:58.720 --> 22:03.760
Instead of, you know, having a second row instead of moving upwards, what I'll do is I'll keep on

22:03.760 --> 22:07.210
updating the values here only you know right.

22:07.480 --> 22:12.220
That we need ACL which is down that means I plus one gamma.

22:13.530 --> 22:19.210
So what I'm doing instead of having another row for I plus one comedy, I keep on updating in the same

22:19.210 --> 22:19.420
rule.

22:20.110 --> 22:24.910
If I keep on updating in this one particular row, I'll be saving memory.

22:25.420 --> 22:25.660
Right.

22:25.810 --> 22:27.100
But I'll not be saving time.

22:28.120 --> 22:29.420
But I'll be saving memory here.

22:29.420 --> 22:29.610
Right?

22:29.680 --> 22:34.810
Because instead of making a whole table where I'm doing it, I'm updating the values in the same row,

22:34.810 --> 22:39.490
because for any value that's needs to be calculated, I actually need this value also.

22:40.560 --> 22:40.710
So.

22:40.960 --> 22:41.990
So you will realize this.

22:41.990 --> 22:42.800
Let me quickly.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.130
Then things here, right?

22:47.620 --> 22:50.350
So now let's say we are on the fifth row.

22:50.420 --> 22:52.120
That means currently I'm on the fifth row.

22:52.590 --> 22:54.460
So what what will happen in the fifth row?

22:54.730 --> 22:58.450
Initially, all the values will be zero, which is this deep.

22:58.450 --> 23:05.440
Plus, when doing all this and starting from five comma five where delegate I get it is equal to one.

23:07.520 --> 23:14.420
And then five, comma six will be equal to the union eight that five Goma six will be equal to six.

23:14.420 --> 23:16.070
Goma six less.

23:16.910 --> 23:19.150
Five comma one eight.

23:19.730 --> 23:22.060
So where is the six common six value?

23:22.070 --> 23:28.340
It is already here today time not you know, keeping something extra to copy the data when the value

23:28.340 --> 23:29.060
is already there.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.070
I will not consider this now.

23:31.400 --> 23:35.480
I just simply add this part and just simply add what's behind it.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.140
So instead of.

23:37.070 --> 23:40.040
Having instead of, you know, finding this value.

23:41.210 --> 23:46.070
This value is already present on this particular cell because I'm just updating that sale again and

23:46.070 --> 23:46.310
again.

23:46.640 --> 23:47.930
It's what is five comma six.

23:48.530 --> 23:51.130
It is it is plus equals to 5 million.

23:51.470 --> 23:52.640
What is five moment zero.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.520
So that's the value here will be one eight.

23:56.060 --> 24:02.900
And yeah, now let's see, I'm on the fourth row, so let's iterate over this row again.

24:03.710 --> 24:10.460
So if I'm the fourth row again, the DBA values will be DPA comma ise for right.

24:10.460 --> 24:14.900
So it will be four, comma D minus four plus the other values.

24:15.530 --> 24:19.430
So we know that on four, comma, four, let me write it out.

24:19.840 --> 24:23.990
One, two, three, four, five, six, one, four, comma for the values will be one.

24:24.410 --> 24:30.560
Then on four, comma, five, the values descriptor five, it's already here eight and plus what will

24:30.560 --> 24:32.690
plus will plus for my one, which is zero.

24:32.750 --> 24:39.010
So again one similarly for a46 we want to do that five common six which is already here because earlier

24:39.050 --> 24:45.830
it was five commits, it was a five through only eight and the value and similarly what I'll do now

24:45.830 --> 24:49.850
let's add I need for the third row what I do again what will happen.

24:49.850 --> 24:51.170
This will be equal to one.

24:52.210 --> 24:52.480
Right.

24:52.780 --> 24:55.210
And this will be 1 to 0.

24:55.210 --> 24:57.130
This will be one plus, again, the zero.

24:57.130 --> 24:58.480
That means this will take this.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.040
This will take this.

25:00.520 --> 25:01.870
But when this will take.

25:03.510 --> 25:03.750
Yeah.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.040
Daddy, Goldman Sachs will take.

25:06.730 --> 25:08.560
Trigonometric trigonometry is.

25:08.860 --> 25:12.670
So here what I I'll get I'll get plus one because you can see the one.

25:12.820 --> 25:13.690
He was already there.

25:13.690 --> 25:14.680
I'm adding one to it.

25:15.130 --> 25:19.450
If I'm adding one to it, let me quickly add one to it and it will become two.

25:20.350 --> 25:22.080
I hope we're getting the point right.

25:22.540 --> 25:23.830
The point is very simple.

25:24.130 --> 25:29.980
Instead of having a whole day, it why don't I just keep one room and keep on updating that rule as

25:29.980 --> 25:36.310
I'm going up, but I'm going upwards for all these rules and I'm continuously just updating one particular

25:36.310 --> 25:39.520
rule that I have kept, because that rule is actually representing the next.

25:40.610 --> 25:41.920
But those are the values that I need.

25:43.060 --> 25:49.540
So just to see if this thing, which is I wonder if I need the next value in the same column.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.250
Why don't I just overwrite?

25:52.240 --> 25:52.840
This value.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.370
So that's that's what it's time to see again what I lose I'll simply overate again in this little I

25:59.370 --> 26:01.140
am one, two and I overate.

26:01.140 --> 26:02.160
I ultimately get this.

26:02.640 --> 26:06.180
Then I look at it and simply get this answer here.

26:06.180 --> 26:08.100
What we can see is so here.

26:08.850 --> 26:11.550
I hope you all are realizing that right now we don't have.

26:12.630 --> 26:14.490
Do the people right.

26:14.760 --> 26:18.510
Look, this can easily be maintained by only one table of.

26:20.980 --> 26:27.280
Of Lent volumes rate to how many columns and columns vacancy rate, which is DPD eight.

26:27.670 --> 26:30.160
So what will be the reconciliation here?

26:31.290 --> 26:36.370
I will start from in and I will go till one eight.

26:36.390 --> 26:40.830
So we are moving backwards and they will start from.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.270
One and will go down.

26:45.720 --> 26:48.450
And so I'm moving backwards and I'm moving right.

26:48.450 --> 26:50.820
Which is well, the DVD is nothing but.

26:52.130 --> 26:52.340
The.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.250
Less AP.

26:58.670 --> 26:59.470
D-minus.

26:59.990 --> 27:05.150
I we know that deep values already kept there because we are overrating things.

27:06.240 --> 27:06.720
It will be.

27:06.720 --> 27:15.990
Just what we'll do is we'll just add on top of the B, they will just add DB minus A and that's exactly

27:15.990 --> 27:16.950
what is happening.

27:19.450 --> 27:20.440
In the second solution.

27:20.440 --> 27:25.510
So I already warned you that this might be a long way to go because it took.

27:26.660 --> 27:28.880
It took it to go to different places.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.920
Here you can see that deep down, I think.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.840
But it is Plexiglas, really big minus.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.060
And that's exactly what we are doing.

27:35.940 --> 27:36.470
They just.

27:37.680 --> 27:38.130
When?

27:39.720 --> 27:41.820
Mishap here, and that is nothing.

27:42.060 --> 27:47.160
But it's very simple that I'm running away from and one and different one doing it.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.910
But in this solution, eyes only from one doing.

27:51.030 --> 27:52.260
And I'm running into one.

27:52.490 --> 27:54.210
Just because that I have taken.

27:55.380 --> 27:55.710
Okay.

27:56.070 --> 28:00.720
Before moving forward, I just want to make sure that this part should be very clear that how is this

28:00.810 --> 28:02.160
deep D-minus I coming?

28:02.580 --> 28:03.990
How is this deep, deep classic?

28:03.990 --> 28:05.460
What should we be doing minus I coming?

28:06.420 --> 28:10.620
The second thing is that here the loops are from one to N and I doing eight.

28:11.580 --> 28:13.980
And in that case the loops are running from end to end.

28:13.980 --> 28:15.360
That means we are going moving backwards.

28:15.630 --> 28:23.220
It's just that because of we have defined our reconciliation, which is the min common eight.

28:23.790 --> 28:27.810
So I just I have a challenge for you basically not a challenge.

28:27.810 --> 28:30.000
You can take it as an exercise or an assignment.

28:30.990 --> 28:36.420
You find the status max command that max will be the maximum element.

28:37.580 --> 28:38.080
Or.

28:41.100 --> 28:41.340
Yeah.

28:41.700 --> 28:42.390
Same thing here.

28:43.820 --> 28:46.010
Number of a number of partitions often.

28:46.310 --> 28:46.930
Let me try it.

28:47.210 --> 28:49.040
Let's call it DP Max comma.

28:49.280 --> 28:53.120
And it will be nothing but number of partitions such that.

28:54.870 --> 28:56.070
Maximum element.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.920
Maximum element.

29:00.100 --> 29:02.560
Is at most.

29:03.350 --> 29:03.830
Max.

29:04.550 --> 29:04.720
Okay.

29:04.850 --> 29:10.790
So instead of mine, if we have Max, then what will happen are min plus one will be replaced to Max.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.290
Minus one because you know.

29:13.290 --> 29:13.630
Right.

29:13.660 --> 29:15.450
And then I'll take Max on and not me.

29:15.540 --> 29:17.400
If I'm not taking maximum, then I see.

29:18.060 --> 29:21.680
If I'm not taking maximum, then it is maximum minus one eight.

29:21.870 --> 29:24.720
So divide and into parts where Max is, it goes to Max minus four.

29:25.140 --> 29:28.110
So in that case, what we'll have will have our max minus one.

29:28.260 --> 29:34.410
And in that case, instead of 80 plus one, where we will have a minus one divided by minus one, that

29:34.410 --> 29:36.150
means I'm depending not on the.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.780
Below arrow, but on the above arrow.

29:39.630 --> 29:44.010
If I'm depending on the above rule, then I'll have to fulfill the first road, then the green road

29:44.010 --> 29:46.100
and her road, then Ford Road, then 50 through and then six.

29:46.590 --> 29:49.050
And in that case, I would start from one point.

29:50.070 --> 29:57.180
It is just that I mean both the things are seem that you run from and over and over and doing it just

29:57.180 --> 29:57.750
that your.

29:59.690 --> 30:02.560
Totally depends on whether you're taken maximum or minimum.

30:02.570 --> 30:06.520
Depends on your state or the record installation will be more or less.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.230
I hope this is also not very confusing.

30:09.800 --> 30:16.220
This might be an advanced DP lecture, but I hope I made things clear and we all have understood that.

30:16.520 --> 30:23.090
Why is this particular solution with all the major takeaways from this particular.

30:24.320 --> 30:30.170
Lecture can be that of course, the reconciliation can be of course, the state of the deep can be seen,

30:30.170 --> 30:36.140
but there can be multiple ways to call it a the reconciliation can be multiple or they will be exactly

30:36.140 --> 30:37.940
one optimal recurrently.

30:38.840 --> 30:39.100
Ooh.

30:39.830 --> 30:40.200
Oh.

30:40.340 --> 30:41.960
That was all from my own gaze.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.670
I hope you enjoyed this.

30:44.730 --> 30:45.120
Thank you.
