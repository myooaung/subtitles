00:00.630 --> 00:03.280
Everyone, let's start with the problem, students.

00:04.180 --> 00:09.820
So this problem is very similar to a game theory problem that has already been discussing the game theory

00:09.820 --> 00:10.330
section.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.780
So if you have not gone through the game theory section, it is the right time to do so and come back

00:16.780 --> 00:18.430
to it and solve this problem yourself.

00:18.770 --> 00:26.710
It will be a very good problem for you if you have understood how does this game to rework or how does

00:26.710 --> 00:28.570
dynamic programming in Game two revokes?

00:29.550 --> 00:29.850
So.

00:31.610 --> 00:35.630
Let's read the problem and then we'll understand this a little bit and then we'll implement it.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.590
So these are said to be consistent and positive.

00:39.590 --> 00:44.770
Indigenous thought will join Sorrow and Zero will play the following game against each other.

00:44.780 --> 00:47.570
Initially we have a pile consisting of keystones.

00:48.680 --> 00:51.380
The two players perform the following operations.

00:51.380 --> 00:53.780
Alternatively, starting from tomorrow.

00:54.230 --> 00:54.620
Okay.

00:54.950 --> 00:56.100
Literally the first player.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.200
It was an element in it and removed exactly a stones from the pipe.

01:02.340 --> 01:10.320
So he says that came out of the set, which we have it was an element X and remove that number of stones

01:10.440 --> 01:13.860
eight from the pie a player loses when he's unable to play.

01:13.980 --> 01:21.750
Assuming that both players play optimally determine the winner of a standard name game and a standard

01:21.750 --> 01:26.850
combinatorial game so we can easily find out the solution of this.

01:27.660 --> 01:31.890
And most of you can do it yourself also because it's not a big deal.

01:31.890 --> 01:33.240
But yes, let me explain.

01:34.960 --> 01:42.420
Let's let me explain by taking our very, very, very simple example, by having 1.3.18.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.400
Let's say in Italy and it goes to 20.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.920
That means I have a pile of 20 stones.

01:51.570 --> 01:51.840
Right.

01:52.020 --> 01:53.610
And my set contains only.

01:56.030 --> 01:57.350
Three elements.

02:07.800 --> 02:08.080
We we.

02:08.170 --> 02:14.230
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.040
And so it's I have these many stones in there.

02:21.050 --> 02:21.240
Right.

02:22.070 --> 02:23.810
So right now we are over here.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.310
We have tinted stones.

02:26.630 --> 02:30.200
And what are the conditions?

02:30.200 --> 02:33.900
Let's say they contains one, two or three stones, 18 stone siding from 20.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.230
What I do is I start backwards.

02:37.430 --> 02:39.730
So let's have in the parlor zero stones.

02:39.740 --> 02:41.160
Then it's a losing position.

02:41.160 --> 02:45.460
So this winning and losing concept has already been expanding the game to a restriction rate.

02:45.770 --> 02:47.240
But still, let's do this.

02:48.020 --> 02:48.380
So.

02:49.500 --> 02:49.720
Yeah.

02:49.950 --> 02:52.410
So this zero is a losing position.

02:52.410 --> 02:53.790
So what does losing position means?

02:54.060 --> 02:57.150
And here we have two players playing the game, which is Darwin zero.

02:57.840 --> 02:58.680
Darwin zero.

02:58.740 --> 02:59.070
Right.

02:59.340 --> 03:07.110
But whoever is on the zero list, that means let's say the pile zero stools right now and it's DeRozan's

03:07.530 --> 03:09.570
so it's a losing position for him.

03:09.750 --> 03:11.490
So it's a winning vision worked out.

03:11.490 --> 03:11.830
All right.

03:11.830 --> 03:18.420
So whoever is playing the game, who's, who's ever chance it is at that particular stage.

03:18.870 --> 03:23.580
Nate Then that's kind of losing position for the good old bill.

03:23.820 --> 03:30.120
One will be a winning position because if a pile is one stone, I can simply take the stone and give

03:30.120 --> 03:31.890
the other player a losing position.

03:32.310 --> 03:36.480
If I'm able to give the other player a losing position, then it becomes a winning position.

03:36.480 --> 03:42.030
For me, similarly to reserve any position, entry is also on winning position because from two I can

03:42.030 --> 03:46.290
take two stones because there is two here and from three I can dig three stones.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.060
Now let's talk about four.

03:49.350 --> 03:54.750
Go from four icon of their peak of one stone to a stone or three stones, and all of them are winning

03:54.750 --> 03:55.230
position.

03:56.980 --> 03:57.250
Well.

03:58.230 --> 04:04.220
Well, if all of them are winning positions and I cannot give losing position to the second player aid,

04:04.290 --> 04:09.090
because right now it's it's my chance to move and I'm on the fourth place.

04:09.300 --> 04:13.860
I first want to add that I can give three or two or one to the next player.

04:15.810 --> 04:16.120
Eight.

04:16.200 --> 04:20.160
Three or two or one because I have only these three types of moves to make.

04:20.910 --> 04:26.160
But it's it becomes a losing position for me because all the others positions which I give to the next

04:26.160 --> 04:28.020
player is a winning position for him.

04:28.940 --> 04:32.840
So if I give him to, he'll simply pick up the stones and give me a losing position, which is zero.

04:32.870 --> 04:33.250
If I.

04:33.650 --> 04:36.310
If I give him three, he gives me zero again.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.150
And if I give him one, he gives me zero again.

04:38.510 --> 04:39.980
A to similarly I use five.

04:40.100 --> 04:43.040
We have an intuition because I can give the player a losing position.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.710
It will be a winning position because I can.

04:45.710 --> 04:47.450
Same reason and seven.

04:47.450 --> 04:48.950
I will also be a winning voice.

04:48.950 --> 04:52.160
And similarly it will be a losing position then winning.

04:53.320 --> 04:56.130
Then losing, winning, losing.

04:56.140 --> 04:58.970
So what was the guarantee value of the water function here?

04:59.110 --> 05:00.670
So the function is very simple.

05:00.670 --> 05:05.680
It's a losing operation if x smart four is equal to zero eight.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.230
So if it's 20, that means.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.650
When these a losing position.

05:10.650 --> 05:11.580
So no matter what.

05:12.540 --> 05:15.250
The first player placed, the second player will give him 16.

05:15.270 --> 05:17.340
Then no matter what the player plays.

05:17.850 --> 05:20.010
Then again, he will give him 12, then ten.

05:20.010 --> 05:20.820
Then again 12.

05:21.150 --> 05:21.660
Then eight.

05:22.170 --> 05:23.940
Then whatever he plays, he'll give him.

05:23.940 --> 05:26.040
For whatever he plays, he'll give him zero.

05:26.220 --> 05:27.420
And the first player will lose.

05:29.270 --> 05:29.600
Eight.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.710
It's like basic theory about game theory.

05:34.340 --> 05:37.100
And if you haven't checked out game theory ghosts, you should check.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.950
It's a nice, loose network it really goes to.

05:40.970 --> 05:47.450
Leaving there to say let's move on to this problem and let's call it out may be an example of one,

05:47.450 --> 05:49.070
two or three moves, right?

05:49.340 --> 05:51.830
But here what we have is we have a whole eddy.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.810
A whole area with some certain number of moves.

05:56.890 --> 05:57.340
So.

05:58.250 --> 05:58.860
Well, it's.

05:58.880 --> 05:59.450
Copy this.

06:01.700 --> 06:06.710
And I think I need to save this, which was Gucci.

06:14.800 --> 06:19.270
So here what we have is we have an so let's input and key.

06:20.340 --> 06:21.900
And what we have is.

06:22.260 --> 06:23.670
Okay, so what?

06:23.670 --> 06:24.510
I didn't get here.

06:25.560 --> 06:29.820
Well, any number of moves that I can make and give you that.

06:29.820 --> 06:38.120
All right, let's have this deep Cabela's win because we need location care 800.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.110
It's a losing positions on making it zero.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.410
Well, now, what I need to do is.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.350
Okay, so before this, let's in put.

06:47.260 --> 06:47.620
It.

06:51.110 --> 06:52.040
But I have the moves.

06:57.040 --> 06:57.340
Eight.

06:57.670 --> 07:02.440
I have taken Bebe and let's start from when let's say I start from one and go still.

07:02.950 --> 07:07.660
So there will already be values one by one like we did in the example.

07:09.590 --> 07:09.860
Eight.

07:10.580 --> 07:14.150
What are the deep values of how we live in these deep values?

07:14.320 --> 07:20.660
So I need to move to all the locations that is from zero two, but it will go to K and this will go

07:20.660 --> 07:21.710
to N eight.

07:23.310 --> 07:29.370
What I do is if I minus the move that I'm willing to make is a if this is greater than equal to zero,

07:29.850 --> 07:36.270
this is a constraint, I think is if you are on if the pine only has two stones and you are picking,

07:36.930 --> 07:38.730
you are making a move with three stones.

07:38.730 --> 07:39.720
So it's not possible.

07:39.900 --> 07:41.370
It is just a constraint check.

07:42.280 --> 07:42.580
Eight.

07:43.090 --> 07:44.920
So how do they do this?

07:45.700 --> 07:46.450
How do I do this?

07:46.480 --> 07:47.890
Initially, what I'll do is I'll.

07:47.890 --> 07:48.430
Mark.

07:49.810 --> 07:54.010
The right position to be a winning position.

07:54.590 --> 07:54.770
Okay.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.290
So let's say it's a winning position.

07:57.390 --> 07:58.190
Initially, right?

07:58.200 --> 08:02.070
So if I'm going to all the losing positions, then it's a sorry.

08:03.210 --> 08:03.510
Okay.

08:03.510 --> 08:04.680
So let me think about this.

08:04.680 --> 08:08.580
How I'm saying deep zero zero, that means it's a losing position.

08:09.730 --> 08:09.930
Eight.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.540
And now I'm taking.

08:17.230 --> 08:17.920
So.

08:19.570 --> 08:22.630
Instead of doing this, let me make it more easier.

08:22.690 --> 08:24.940
So let's see whether it's a winning or losing position.

08:25.450 --> 08:27.250
But I think it's a winning position initially.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.530
So what is a winning position?

08:29.530 --> 08:30.340
Let's get back.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.170
A winning Bush-Cheney operation when there's at least one losing.

08:34.170 --> 08:38.100
But right now, it's market as a losing position.

08:38.490 --> 08:39.600
When is it goes to zero?

08:39.600 --> 08:40.920
That means it's a losing position.

08:41.430 --> 08:43.200
Well, it's it's a billion.

08:44.310 --> 08:44.570
Eight.

08:44.940 --> 08:49.340
But what happens is it's a losing position now because nobody.

08:49.350 --> 08:54.830
LEWIS I'll check if I minister is greater than equal to zero and at the same time, if deep, I mean

08:54.860 --> 08:58.560
NCAA, if this is a winning position.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.510
So what is winning here?

08:59.520 --> 09:00.030
It is one.

09:01.300 --> 09:01.560
Hey.

09:02.110 --> 09:02.410
So.

09:04.450 --> 09:04.930
In Italy.

09:04.930 --> 09:09.310
I've said that it's a losing position when I'm making it as a losing position.

09:09.310 --> 09:14.050
But if I'm able to find out any other losing position, then my current position becomes.

09:15.030 --> 09:17.490
Which is deep, it becomes a winning party.

09:19.240 --> 09:25.030
So what I do is I simply say DP, I is Z2 always don't get confused.

09:26.560 --> 09:31.840
We're going to go the ways to right so initially and mounted as a losing guy because.

09:35.070 --> 09:36.330
If I'm not able to make any move.

09:36.330 --> 09:37.310
Let's see it.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.030
So all these moves were out of bounds.

09:39.090 --> 09:43.350
So it will remain a losing position because I'm kind of unable to make a move.

09:44.910 --> 09:46.230
But here.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.810
In this case, if I'm able to make a move, I'll just take that.

09:50.810 --> 09:53.540
If I'm able to give a.

09:54.420 --> 09:54.810
Okay.

09:55.170 --> 09:58.200
If I were to give either guy a losing position, it is.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.740
If DB A-minus here is zero eight.

10:00.810 --> 10:04.860
If I get at least one losing vision, I'll just make him go to the losing position.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.450
So this becomes a winning position.

10:06.450 --> 10:10.740
I can also break if I have at least one losing and I'll break.

10:11.650 --> 10:11.840
Eight.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.510
And finally, what will be the answer?

10:13.720 --> 10:14.710
It will really pay off.

10:16.240 --> 10:16.810
So if.

10:19.530 --> 10:20.370
What I need to bring.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.130
I need to print first or second rate.

10:24.730 --> 10:25.620
Yeah, I suppose.

10:26.380 --> 10:33.010
So if we have b of care, that means if it's true, if it's one, then it's a winning position.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.840
If it's a winning voice and then first wins.

10:35.350 --> 10:37.810
Else that can means.

10:39.670 --> 10:39.940
Eight.

10:42.210 --> 10:43.410
Well, we have second to.

10:44.840 --> 10:45.110
Okay.

10:45.110 --> 10:48.600
So there is some issue in this we have to foreign duty.

10:48.630 --> 10:53.510
Let's take ready made two four and do three.

10:57.230 --> 10:58.790
So the ad is for Lent.

10:59.270 --> 11:00.400
The Bible is full length.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.430
One, two, three, four.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.080
Initially zero.

11:04.040 --> 11:04.330
Eight.

11:04.550 --> 11:06.010
And what are the moves that I can make?

11:06.020 --> 11:07.460
I can make moves to entry.

11:08.090 --> 11:12.770
So this will be a losing position because I cannot make a move from one, but from two I can go to zero

11:12.990 --> 11:19.760
and then it's a winning position in three again is a winning version, but four is kind of if I go to

11:19.760 --> 11:22.640
it's of any position, but if I go through, it's a losing patience.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.870
But again, it's a winning version.

11:25.120 --> 11:25.290
Yeah.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.330
So I think I made a mistake while calling it me.

11:29.100 --> 11:30.190
I'd be values.

11:32.720 --> 11:36.870
If b i m from zero to e.

11:38.830 --> 11:39.730
Would it be?

11:44.100 --> 11:47.650
We have 00100y we have 100.

11:48.330 --> 11:49.740
It is equal to two.

11:52.530 --> 11:53.910
Sorry, guys, but sorry.

11:53.910 --> 11:54.230
Sorry.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.380
It won't be.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.680
It will be 88.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.660
Because we are traversing the seas.

12:00.660 --> 12:01.290
Actually, the.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.790
Index of the 88.

12:05.630 --> 12:06.110
Let's see.

12:07.040 --> 12:07.280
Yeah.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.120
No, it's correct.

12:10.380 --> 12:10.620
Yeah.

12:10.620 --> 12:11.790
Some indexing.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.310
But what's two and five?

12:16.150 --> 12:17.860
We are getting sick and it's a little sick.

12:17.860 --> 12:18.010
Why?

12:18.010 --> 12:18.760
We're getting sicker.

12:19.540 --> 12:20.410
If I have this.

12:20.920 --> 12:21.160
Sorry.

12:21.460 --> 12:21.940
If I have this.

12:21.940 --> 12:22.480
One more.

12:23.430 --> 12:24.780
Place to fill.

12:24.930 --> 12:29.460
So here what we get we have is we can go to places we own or we can go three places behind.

12:29.850 --> 12:30.840
All of them are winning.

12:31.320 --> 12:35.490
But if I mean, if I'm giving the player a winning position, then this has to be a losing position

12:35.490 --> 12:36.090
for me because.

12:36.510 --> 12:40.080
Because the player will win from the next place, whatever I give him.

12:41.020 --> 12:41.320
They?

12:43.440 --> 12:43.670
Well.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.910
So that's what it was about this problem that submitted to.

12:49.790 --> 12:53.450
A meeting is important because we get to know about our mistakes.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.140
I actually recorded all these problems last year, like 1.5 years ago maybe, and I'm quoting it, and

13:06.530 --> 13:09.080
I'm having a good speaker, I.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.270
So it's not a big deal.

13:12.580 --> 13:18.840
But the complexity of the solution it is in and what is going to win according to the problem.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.550
Is 120 per fight, which is nothing.

13:25.810 --> 13:26.170
So.

13:26.320 --> 13:26.980
Thank you, guys.

13:27.220 --> 13:28.000
In the next.
