00:00.580 --> 00:00.780
Yeah.

00:00.880 --> 00:02.860
So let's put this problem quickly.

00:05.910 --> 00:07.350
These simple and.

00:08.640 --> 00:11.820
Let's take this racism, then.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.410
Let's take it as an input.

00:13.980 --> 00:14.490
It's the end.

00:14.490 --> 00:15.540
Is this end pricing?

00:15.540 --> 00:16.890
There is one three.

00:18.300 --> 00:18.930
All five.

00:19.950 --> 00:20.580
Seven nine.

00:22.010 --> 00:23.120
1011.

00:24.030 --> 00:24.230
Eight.

00:24.990 --> 00:25.830
Let's dig in.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.880
And big prices.

00:31.210 --> 00:32.170
Prices.

00:32.170 --> 00:32.470
And.

00:34.070 --> 00:35.030
It has been put.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.380
The in crisis.

00:41.440 --> 00:46.840
The one thing that we can do is instead of racism, let's take a different one.

00:47.170 --> 00:52.060
And it's a process when, you know, it's basically I'm just taking it as one based index.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.940
But then we don't get confused later.

00:54.550 --> 00:57.770
The prices one will be equal to the price for one.

00:57.790 --> 01:02.800
And right now what I can do is I can simply call DP instead of DP.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.060
You can alternate getting.

01:05.410 --> 01:06.070
What the works.

01:06.910 --> 01:07.930
So this is not getting function.

01:07.930 --> 01:08.550
What will it give?

01:08.560 --> 01:09.820
I will pass and do it.

01:10.360 --> 01:12.310
I will pass prices added to it.

01:12.970 --> 01:15.280
And is there anything I must know?

01:15.280 --> 01:16.420
And in prices is enough.

01:16.450 --> 01:21.600
I guess it will give me the best, the maximum amount of getting this end according to this basis.

01:22.060 --> 01:23.200
Eight bullets.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.800
I tried cutting lipstick and and lipstick.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.510
This prices area by.

01:29.630 --> 01:35.060
See my reference because otherwise it will, you know, copy it.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.340
And all those clapping will take a lot of names.

01:39.740 --> 01:40.760
So what are the next steps?

01:41.150 --> 01:42.140
Next step is nothing.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.480
We have already formed a recursive relation.

01:44.480 --> 01:45.890
And that is this.

01:48.090 --> 01:48.480
So.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.230
Yeah, it's.

01:51.850 --> 01:57.930
It's family dancing, a little sick, answering zero, answering nothing but maximoff and the coma of

01:58.060 --> 01:59.290
all the possible options.

01:59.650 --> 02:00.820
I will go from one to in.

02:00.820 --> 02:07.030
I'm getting it out into I right now and the rest remaining will again while you're not cutting and it

02:07.030 --> 02:08.680
will automatically give us the answer.

02:09.490 --> 02:12.240
But if I'm cutting the in so I will.

02:12.290 --> 02:13.660
Price is a less.

02:15.220 --> 02:15.940
Start getting.

02:16.950 --> 02:22.830
And in not getting what I should and minus a firstly because now the remaining length of the road is

02:22.830 --> 02:27.510
an minus eight because I wanted to get in by and including the prices.

02:27.910 --> 02:30.510
And the second is like just pass the price pricing that as it is.

02:31.080 --> 02:36.330
But passing the error doesn't take up doesn't take time because.

02:37.430 --> 02:43.160
Also, it is not a variable, it is just an additive which I am just passing so that I can use it.

02:43.490 --> 02:43.880
Values.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.480
Well and yeah.

02:47.270 --> 02:51.460
Well, this is hard getting in minus eight and I'm passing the prices, I'm taking the maximum on them.

02:51.470 --> 02:54.830
And finally what I'll do is I'll return the answer, whatever is the maximum.

02:55.470 --> 02:56.930
Well, what are the biscuits here?

02:56.990 --> 02:57.920
Biscuits is simple.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.230
When end it is zero.

02:59.390 --> 03:00.800
Ultimately written zero.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.860
Because right of zero land is zero.

03:03.860 --> 03:08.110
Right, because there's nothing to get the there won't be any amount that is generated.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.240
I hope this is very clear.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.180
It's believed once.

03:13.250 --> 03:13.520
Okay.

03:13.640 --> 03:17.420
So here we can see the best answer is 12 eight and the.

03:18.910 --> 03:22.780
In the goals section in the end of the course.

03:22.780 --> 03:30.250
I have also, you know, shared some tips and tricks on how you can backtrack the solution of any dynamic

03:30.250 --> 03:31.150
programming problem.

03:31.540 --> 03:34.330
If you are writing it enabling solution, you have got the best answer.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.520
But how is this answer coming like?

03:37.640 --> 03:40.680
In this case I have this drill, but I do not know what I need.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.720
That in which guards I'm getting this rather planted so that I'm getting the.

03:46.480 --> 03:54.460
But even that I can derive or derive from this deepest obligation, and I've shared that in the tapes

03:54.460 --> 04:00.100
and dissection, you're going to do that for any of the dynamic programming solution by using the approach

04:00.100 --> 04:00.820
that I have mentioned.

04:02.320 --> 04:10.510
And by that, you can easily understand and I mean I will suggest you to try it that you can understand

04:10.510 --> 04:13.780
it, and what better time dividing it so that I'm getting this.

04:14.870 --> 04:18.670
Hate and good natured memorization.

04:19.990 --> 04:20.700
You guys are.

04:20.820 --> 04:23.850
Tell me, what is the dude said?

04:24.830 --> 04:25.730
There's only one student.

04:25.730 --> 04:27.280
This is just an error that I'm passing.

04:27.320 --> 04:30.020
I could have even taken this area as a global variable.

04:31.220 --> 04:38.090
So it's this bus logistic memo and what is Anya and is the end of the road.

04:38.180 --> 04:40.190
So it can be use land.

04:40.190 --> 04:44.360
Because now we can see that this broadcasting is a.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.620
One dimensional problem.

04:48.230 --> 04:49.340
One dimensional problem.

04:50.190 --> 04:53.000
If it is a one dimensional problem, then dimensions can be huge.

04:53.390 --> 04:53.840
It's a.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.520
The problem is off and.

04:59.210 --> 05:05.000
The solution is of an overall friend being after memories to later memorize it.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.170
I will simply say from when is an article two minus one written memo in.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.470
Device IP this.

05:13.380 --> 05:13.950
Basted.

05:15.370 --> 05:16.720
Before calling the function.

05:16.720 --> 05:17.320
Let me just.

05:19.230 --> 05:20.580
It is one.

05:22.590 --> 05:23.460
Memo eight.

05:24.960 --> 05:25.680
Something I missed.

05:27.890 --> 05:28.500
Acute care.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.900
Instead of their litigated.

05:35.780 --> 05:38.890
Well, this isn't a win solution because I memorized it.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.000
So this end would be calculated.

05:41.000 --> 05:41.930
Exactly one thing.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.460
And now.

05:44.400 --> 05:50.250
This one important thing that I want to share the face complexity of the solution is when.

05:51.870 --> 05:54.510
But the time complexity liquidated.

05:55.580 --> 06:05.660
This complexity is win, but the time complexity of the solution is and complexity is off.

06:06.410 --> 06:07.460
And in doing my.

06:08.410 --> 06:08.710
Why?

06:08.740 --> 06:10.780
Because we have end state.

06:10.780 --> 06:11.230
I agree.

06:11.230 --> 06:14.440
We are calculating all end states exactly 1.8.

06:14.980 --> 06:15.310
But.

06:16.590 --> 06:17.770
We have a for a look inside.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.790
That means we are doing an orphanage stroke.

06:21.870 --> 06:26.070
Often extra work inside each.

06:27.110 --> 06:30.080
Inside each state we have answered and for all good.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.890
And instead I'm having this follow up.

06:31.890 --> 06:34.280
I'm having a Burghoff and lind land.

06:35.300 --> 06:41.450
In that case, what happens is this complexity the in but the tango complexity then increases two and

06:41.450 --> 06:42.510
square eight.

06:42.800 --> 06:50.760
So the complexity of the targeting problem is and square but it is a the problem rate base conflict.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.350
This is when it is a one dimensionality problem it is only one state.

06:54.650 --> 07:01.520
But inside that state I'm doing some extra work, but I hope you understand this that not all problems

07:01.520 --> 07:04.940
will be un it can be when squared as well in the complexity.

07:05.480 --> 07:10.340
Of course they have one state, but and complexity varies depending on the work that I do inside.

07:11.620 --> 07:11.890
It.

07:12.920 --> 07:13.370
So.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.960
Then sit and see in the next part.
