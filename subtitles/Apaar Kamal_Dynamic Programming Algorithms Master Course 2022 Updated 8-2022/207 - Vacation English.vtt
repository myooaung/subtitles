WEBVTT

00:00.830 --> 00:01.700
Welcome, everyone.

00:01.790 --> 00:04.190
So come to the.

00:05.310 --> 00:06.750
Next problem, vacation.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.520
Again, a nice problem.

00:08.820 --> 00:12.600
You will get another way of implementing our dining programming solution.

00:14.380 --> 00:17.290
As I said, all the problems are unique in their own ways.

00:17.860 --> 00:19.600
It's a lens through the problem statement.

00:20.290 --> 00:24.760
That Awesome Obligation starts tomorrow and he's decided to make plans for it now.

00:26.450 --> 00:28.940
The vacation consists of entries for each.

00:28.940 --> 00:33.320
A Toro will choose one of the following activities and do it on the island.

00:33.320 --> 00:42.020
To be a swim in the sea in a points of happiness we catch books in the mountains can be a point of happiness

00:42.470 --> 00:47.150
to do homework at home in S.A. Points of Happiness Pool.

00:47.150 --> 00:51.020
So actually here we have three transitions basically that you can do.

00:51.140 --> 00:56.990
First, they cannot type, but here we have another concern which is very important that air start who

00:56.990 --> 01:04.070
gets bored easily because I think I am taught you cannot do the same activities for two or more consecutive

01:04.070 --> 01:04.340
days.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.150
Like me, I.

01:07.180 --> 01:08.800
So what does this line mean?

01:08.800 --> 01:14.560
What does it actually want to say that if Thoreau has done swimming in the previous day, then he cannot

01:14.560 --> 01:18.730
seem he or she cannot then cannot swim the next day.

01:19.330 --> 01:23.170
Now added, they are to catch bugs in the mountains or do the Armageddon.

01:23.530 --> 01:26.410
Similarly, if there catch the bug the previous day.

01:27.550 --> 01:29.290
We are not talking about the previous days.

01:29.290 --> 01:29.730
Previous.

01:30.010 --> 01:31.930
I mean the day before yesterday.

01:31.930 --> 01:33.130
I'm just talking about yesterday.

01:33.130 --> 01:34.330
What Thoreau did.

01:34.840 --> 01:39.160
Whatever he did, he cannot do the same thing in the next day.

01:39.160 --> 01:43.570
The consecutive day nature is there for two or more consecutive straight.

01:43.570 --> 01:49.660
So it should be very clear find the maximum possible total point of happiness, the Thoreau gain.

01:49.660 --> 01:56.830
So this is the standard and what we are getting AB in to what is the land of men and the power by great.

01:58.050 --> 02:01.530
So let's copy the first input and let's see how this bugs actually.

02:04.870 --> 02:05.460
What's it?

02:05.500 --> 02:06.130
Vacation.

02:14.190 --> 02:14.400
Well.

02:14.550 --> 02:15.990
So here we have three.

02:19.090 --> 02:20.290
Then we have the.

02:21.830 --> 02:22.220
Ten.

02:23.070 --> 02:23.640
40.

02:24.500 --> 02:25.160
70.

02:26.160 --> 02:29.140
2053.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.380
A very nice problem.

02:30.390 --> 02:36.060
Both of these are very similar problem to this, which is how slow.

02:36.070 --> 02:44.030
But I just think the problem only good if you haven't Alice Roper and there are two parts of it do both

02:44.040 --> 02:47.550
after doing this and you learn a lot from the problem.

02:48.550 --> 02:50.170
So 30.

02:51.210 --> 02:51.730
60.

02:52.830 --> 02:55.710
And so these are the problem calls painting the fence.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.560
Ending the fence like this is a problem.

02:59.610 --> 02:59.830
Yeah.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.800
Painting the fence on gold forces aid.

03:02.890 --> 03:10.540
And on the problem that I was talking about with house robot, they are very similar problems and these

03:10.540 --> 03:11.830
are the rolling pin downs.

03:11.830 --> 03:14.620
I guess only people are sure about the third one.

03:14.620 --> 03:17.320
But yes, all these problems are very similar to this problem.

03:17.830 --> 03:21.580
And first of all, let's discuss this then you can easily solve all the problems.

03:23.990 --> 03:26.960
So here what we have is a so let's not look at the answer.

03:30.820 --> 03:31.450
What does this mean?

03:31.450 --> 03:34.510
But it means that we have three rose martyrs.

03:34.510 --> 03:35.860
Three rose means we have three.

03:39.710 --> 03:44.860
This raid and all this three days have three different activities.

03:44.870 --> 03:45.900
The first activity.

03:46.220 --> 03:47.240
The second activity.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.230
And the third activity.

03:49.010 --> 03:51.410
So the first day I can do any activity, right?

03:51.420 --> 03:56.030
So what is the first step that I defined when I was starting the game programming thing?

03:56.420 --> 03:57.830
It is forming a state.

03:58.380 --> 04:03.320
We have to form a state, but we have to think about what kind of state do I need?

04:03.680 --> 04:06.770
States should be constraint specific.

04:06.770 --> 04:12.260
Basically, the search should actually be according to the constraints also.

04:12.260 --> 04:15.530
And also, yes, you can easily form recursive relation from that state.

04:15.980 --> 04:20.690
If you have taken the wrong state initially, then you cannot easily move with the dynamic programming

04:20.690 --> 04:23.150
solution because you have figured out the wrong state.

04:24.110 --> 04:29.510
So if you ever answer that means the first step you are moving towards a solution is wrong.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.550
That means whole part will go wrong.

04:31.550 --> 04:31.910
Right?

04:32.980 --> 04:36.180
So the first step is very important.

04:36.190 --> 04:37.270
We're just forming the state.

04:37.660 --> 04:42.790
So let's take the kind of what state should it be from this?

04:43.210 --> 04:45.140
What are the maximum total points of happiness?

04:45.300 --> 04:46.090
They're talking.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.830
What do we really define?

04:47.830 --> 04:51.970
A state that deep, i.e. is a.

04:53.010 --> 04:53.670
Equal to.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.360
Maximum.

04:58.730 --> 04:59.600
Happiness.

05:04.050 --> 05:05.580
Maximum happiness.

05:08.340 --> 05:10.710
Maximum possible total point of happiness.

05:11.250 --> 05:12.090
So maximum.

05:13.690 --> 05:15.370
Points of happiness and happiness.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.230
Happiness cannot be counted.

05:17.970 --> 05:20.800
Eight Maximum Points of happiness.

05:25.530 --> 05:27.180
On identity.

05:27.630 --> 05:31.770
So let's define this first and now let's think about what states can make.

05:32.730 --> 05:39.990
Well, if I define the API then it doesn't actually contain the information related to what activity

05:39.990 --> 05:41.130
did it perform the last day?

05:41.550 --> 05:47.520
Because I want that information, write it, what activity I performed the previous day because that's

05:47.520 --> 05:48.240
very important.

05:48.660 --> 05:52.830
If I performed activity the previous day, I cannot make that transition.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.540
So what I'll do is.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.100
I'll make this trade off.

05:58.210 --> 06:01.180
It'd be I'd go gma3 what is to be a government release?

06:01.660 --> 06:05.950
It simply means that what is a maximum happiness?

06:05.980 --> 06:08.830
Maximum points of happiness on the air today.

06:13.030 --> 06:14.430
Instead of three, let's say de.

06:16.260 --> 06:17.220
Make it a variable.

06:17.610 --> 06:21.270
The day will be actually if git activity.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.160
Is being.

06:28.550 --> 06:30.320
The word assisted means that.

06:31.550 --> 06:37.940
On the eighth day, if I'm performing an activity, either A, B or C, Rachel zero can have zero one

06:37.940 --> 06:40.670
or two value zero one or two values, which are the three values?

06:41.610 --> 06:41.950
Buddy.

06:43.020 --> 06:43.380
So.

06:43.620 --> 06:43.890
Yeah.

06:44.950 --> 06:50.620
But it can have either one of these three values which is DB i.e. ending the maximum points of happiness

06:50.620 --> 06:51.400
on identity.

06:51.550 --> 06:56.200
If GI activities are being performed, very simple rates of knowledge will destabilize.

06:57.190 --> 06:57.790
Hmm.

06:57.920 --> 06:58.270
Okay.

06:58.270 --> 06:59.260
So I just buried it here.

06:59.260 --> 07:00.910
Only I do this.

07:02.550 --> 07:05.880
This will really be tables of what should be lending volumes.

07:08.640 --> 07:13.410
The Land Rover should be in within the number of days and the column should be three, which is the

07:13.410 --> 07:16.590
number of activities there's might have to be accommodate eight.

07:17.240 --> 07:20.370
What is deep, I imagine it is are I cross g.

07:22.110 --> 07:22.740
Function right.

07:22.770 --> 07:27.840
And what what are the values of I, I start from one in this case.

07:28.620 --> 07:31.530
Well, I do not get confused at the time of explanation.

07:31.530 --> 07:35.220
I take sometimes zero base indexing and sometimes one base indexing it.

07:35.970 --> 07:38.880
And what is the values of G do?

07:38.940 --> 07:40.410
You can either be zero to.

07:42.370 --> 07:44.030
And zero means activity.

07:45.580 --> 07:48.190
One means activity B and two means activity.

07:49.390 --> 07:50.290
Very simple rate.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.070
Let me.

07:52.760 --> 07:53.030
Yeah.

07:53.480 --> 07:57.380
There is 012 and 012.

07:58.210 --> 07:58.670
Again.

07:58.670 --> 08:00.310
Again, I made the same mistake.

08:00.320 --> 08:04.910
I am just taking a zero base indexing rate, so I'm digging days to be numbered from 012.

08:04.910 --> 08:05.190
Right.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.580
So let me quickly it is this also.

08:09.330 --> 08:14.160
But zero two and minus one for everyday.

08:15.830 --> 08:16.250
Now.

08:16.910 --> 08:17.240
Yeah.

08:17.270 --> 08:18.440
Now, let's talk about the first dig.

08:18.650 --> 08:20.600
Let's start with the first day, about the first rule.

08:21.410 --> 08:23.270
So what is the maximum happiness?

08:23.300 --> 08:27.290
If I perform activity on the first day, there are no constraints over here.

08:27.290 --> 08:30.500
I can perform any activity on the first day because there is no previous day.

08:31.490 --> 08:35.150
So the deep value should be in 1470.

08:36.190 --> 08:36.480
Right.

08:37.000 --> 08:37.640
Very easy.

08:37.660 --> 08:38.920
Not all heavy stuff.

08:39.460 --> 08:41.140
Now, let's talk about the second row, guys.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.070
So here is the tricky part, right?

08:43.930 --> 08:48.160
If you want to perform activity, that means I'm talking with the cell one, comma zero.

08:48.280 --> 08:54.670
It means on the first day I'm performing activity in the event performing activity when they should

08:54.670 --> 08:57.430
come, because that is the number of happiness.

08:57.880 --> 09:03.960
That is the happiness is getting after performing activity on the first day.

09:04.820 --> 09:05.040
Eight.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.180
So when day will come, we all know, right?

09:09.560 --> 09:10.050
But no.

09:10.070 --> 09:11.060
What else should come?

09:12.110 --> 09:13.370
What are the transitions?

09:13.430 --> 09:18.050
So on the previous day, on the previous day, what is the maximum happiness?

09:18.380 --> 09:21.940
If Tora performed activities other than the.

09:22.880 --> 09:23.250
Right.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.800
So that's what the questions say, right?

09:24.800 --> 09:26.270
We cannot perform two activities.

09:27.170 --> 09:29.840
We cannot perform the same activities on two consecutive days.

09:30.960 --> 09:31.890
I know.

09:32.430 --> 09:36.210
And they're destroying De Ville building with this 40.

09:38.230 --> 09:42.880
Because this is the maximum happiness evaporative one is performing on the previous day or it will be

09:42.880 --> 09:46.930
linked with 75 because this is the maximum happiness.

09:47.350 --> 09:53.990
If activity two is performed on the previous day but destroying decay and not building written by same

09:54.010 --> 09:54.310
reason.

09:54.310 --> 10:00.370
Because if I make this transition of 10 to 20, that means I'm performing the activities on the set

10:00.790 --> 10:06.080
and performing same activities on to the new ones negative base, which should not be a.

10:09.750 --> 10:10.770
When it transition.

10:12.050 --> 10:13.400
According to the problem statement.

10:14.210 --> 10:15.680
What are the values that I'll get?

10:16.310 --> 10:19.460
And then it will be sorted with 20 plus maximum off.

10:20.570 --> 10:24.740
And then 40 or 70, which is Dubai minus one.

10:25.660 --> 10:26.560
Another activity activities.

10:27.280 --> 10:27.490
Well.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.990
So how can I define a reconciliation here?

10:31.360 --> 10:33.970
The reconciliation is equal to the idea.

10:34.000 --> 10:34.990
Is equal to.

10:36.530 --> 10:39.020
Maximum off BP.

10:39.980 --> 10:40.940
I minus one.

10:41.750 --> 10:44.390
And JJ, what is the ability?

10:45.020 --> 10:50.990
Double J's from 0 to 2 and double J is not equal to.

10:52.530 --> 10:52.760
J.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.630
Because they cannot have the same attitude.

10:57.240 --> 10:57.640
So deep.

10:57.660 --> 10:58.980
I mean, is one double j's.

10:59.460 --> 11:06.930
Which is all the it is going for all these days plus the cost of this which is what is the magic scheme?

11:08.060 --> 11:08.180
The.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.210
So let's call it.

11:13.370 --> 11:14.780
So let's call it edgy.

11:15.620 --> 11:16.190
Not easy.

11:17.090 --> 11:18.110
So you got this right?

11:18.590 --> 11:21.410
That it'll all be A-okay, depending on the.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.410
But we did hate this guy.

11:25.560 --> 11:29.460
This can be either NBA or city, depending on g, f, g zero.

11:29.460 --> 11:29.990
It is e.

11:31.230 --> 11:33.030
If there is one, it is BA.

11:33.030 --> 11:34.080
And if J street is.

11:35.690 --> 11:35.930
Well.

11:37.070 --> 11:38.600
That's a reconciliation reformed.

11:39.230 --> 11:43.490
Now, guys, if I linked 20 with 40 or 70, the maximum will come from 72.

11:43.490 --> 11:44.690
It will be 90 with you.

11:45.530 --> 11:52.340
Similarly for the second, what is 50 on this 50 and not willing with this 40?

11:52.580 --> 11:54.350
It can either be written or 70.

11:54.830 --> 11:57.380
So the maximum is 70, 70 plus 51, 20.

11:58.070 --> 12:00.650
And now coming on to the third, which is 80.

12:00.650 --> 12:03.140
So it is 80 plus as it 40th.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.800
And no, not we cannot take 78, it is 40 plus.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.690
Then we just 50, 87, 30.

12:09.790 --> 12:10.060
Right?

12:10.550 --> 12:11.110
Oh, yeah.

12:12.340 --> 12:17.110
This is about the second day, literally for the third day to begin, guys, for the third day we have

12:17.110 --> 12:17.540
today.

12:17.590 --> 12:20.920
This party can be so we cannot perform the same activity.

12:21.340 --> 12:27.900
That means I cannot link decided this transition cannot be made to what are the allowed transitions.

12:27.910 --> 12:29.470
It is 120 and 130.

12:29.860 --> 12:33.320
That means what is the maximum happiness on the previous day?

12:33.340 --> 12:40.120
If I did activity one or two, then only I can do activities zero under current rate.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.650
So how do we get this?

12:43.790 --> 12:48.730
It is either 120 or 130 where it is max vandalism x 130 plus hour days.

12:50.220 --> 12:51.420
What is 130 plus 30?

12:52.390 --> 12:54.820
It is 168 and.

12:56.270 --> 12:57.020
Well, this again.

12:57.170 --> 13:01.940
Well, you were just 60 over here, so it'll be 60 plus either 90 or 130 now.

13:02.300 --> 13:05.390
So it will be 60 plus 130, which is 190.

13:05.390 --> 13:07.730
And what is the last which is 90 plus the other one?

13:07.730 --> 13:08.870
90 or 90?

13:09.080 --> 13:11.000
Another one born before 94.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.250
It is 90 plus 120, even just 210.

13:15.100 --> 13:15.400
Eight.

13:15.790 --> 13:16.090
Okay.

13:16.450 --> 13:21.970
I hope you can see why I'd be not worried about what the person did on the previous two previous days.

13:22.030 --> 13:23.500
That means day before yesterday.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.800
You're just worried about what you did yesterday and me?

13:26.800 --> 13:28.930
The maximum happiness if you did this yesterday?

13:30.150 --> 13:35.080
Well, if I have to do separate values, two different values of the other activities which are not

13:35.080 --> 13:40.810
included, I'd simply take the maximum that you did this activity the previous day, and he's getting

13:40.810 --> 13:45.010
the maximum point of happiness by performing this activity the day before.

13:45.370 --> 13:47.590
And I'll take that into my current condition.

13:47.590 --> 13:47.940
And it.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.210
There shouldn't be any choice.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.560
This could have been like extended below.

13:55.560 --> 13:56.880
But I hope you understood this.

13:57.220 --> 13:59.040
Let's make the transitions in this table.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.120
It will become very easy.

14:00.660 --> 14:03.540
This 90 came from 20 plus 70.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.160
So it is this transition.

14:05.890 --> 14:06.330
And.

14:07.650 --> 14:07.890
Yeah.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.600
So it's still going to happen.

14:11.820 --> 14:19.590
This transition is a fast transition disjointed this 120 game from this again 70 and this 130 game from.

14:21.630 --> 14:22.560
A D-plus.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.430
I think I did a mistake, I guess.

14:29.500 --> 14:29.830
Okay.

14:29.830 --> 14:30.580
So this.

14:32.200 --> 14:37.540
How did this one party game when it came from your tubeless maximum of ten inventory.

14:37.930 --> 14:41.600
I actually added ten in 40, so it should not be 130.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.050
It should be one 2040.

14:44.660 --> 14:44.920
Eight.

14:45.780 --> 14:45.990
Yeah.

14:45.990 --> 14:46.890
It should be 120.

14:48.050 --> 14:50.140
So this came from this transition.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.020
Similarly, let's talk for 160.

14:54.650 --> 14:57.800
So this 160 is again wrong.

14:57.950 --> 15:00.340
It is 150 because of the values.

15:00.370 --> 15:02.330
Let me feel all of this again.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.350
Think it is 120 plus.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.030
So one rule is maximum on the two.

15:08.030 --> 15:09.040
So it is 150 now.

15:09.610 --> 15:15.340
Now this be 60 plus one 2180 and this will be 90 plus 120, which is 208.

15:15.350 --> 15:19.600
So the answer is, of course, 210, but the transitions have been changed.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.860
Eight And this 210 comes from this.

15:23.350 --> 15:23.830
Always.

15:24.700 --> 15:25.690
So what are the.

15:25.960 --> 15:33.610
So how can I find if I want to find out a perfect solution, that these are the activities of a fund

15:33.970 --> 15:41.050
that can simply trace back to 210 came from the third activity, which came from 120, which is the

15:41.050 --> 15:48.820
second activity and it came from 120 came from again the third activity which is 78.

15:48.970 --> 15:50.080
So it is C, B and C.

15:50.110 --> 15:53.710
So first you perform C, then he performs B and then you perform C.

15:54.130 --> 16:00.490
So here you can see we we do not have consecutive same characters because we cannot have.

16:02.650 --> 16:04.510
The activity in the consecutive days.

16:06.020 --> 16:09.230
Well, I think that's enough of a you know what the explanation.

16:09.230 --> 16:10.310
Bartlett scored it out.

16:10.310 --> 16:11.990
No, and let's do it very quick.

16:13.100 --> 16:13.850
Oh, yeah.

16:21.340 --> 16:23.950
So how many will use the to of the good fight.

16:23.980 --> 16:24.850
So let's staggered.

16:30.350 --> 16:33.800
I'm not taking three different absences.

16:34.070 --> 16:37.280
I'll just take one, which is only two, Ian and three.

16:39.130 --> 16:39.280
Okay.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.900
So this will store all the activities.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.940
Similarly, let's take a deeper.

16:45.030 --> 16:46.770
Well, let's take an.

16:47.670 --> 16:48.720
It's important.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.110
And.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.490
And let's.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.130
Go to all the and.

17:03.450 --> 17:05.400
The rate today will go from zero to.

17:06.290 --> 17:06.670
Okay.

17:06.680 --> 17:07.280
So I'm.

17:08.340 --> 17:10.370
Illustrate this, what you see in AIG.

17:12.510 --> 17:15.600
Hey, Joe, I've taken the input, not issue.

17:16.320 --> 17:18.840
Let's fill the base cases, which is BP zero.

17:19.590 --> 17:24.690
It is BP zero zero is equal to is zero zero.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.440
Hey, because I'm filling in for the first day.

17:30.010 --> 17:31.420
So let's copy this.

17:32.020 --> 17:35.650
Epic 01010202.

17:36.850 --> 17:43.180
So now I want you to do the memorization by yourself, which should not be an issue, because I've already

17:43.690 --> 17:45.040
made this a causal relation.

17:46.390 --> 17:47.440
You can do that yourself.

17:48.220 --> 17:51.550
Now let's put all the other deep values.

17:53.060 --> 17:53.320
Eight.

17:56.010 --> 18:04.830
So what we have is we have to start it from one because we are for the 0008 and start from from one.

18:04.860 --> 18:10.980
So what we'll do is we'll say deep, i.e. there is maximum of EBITDA.

18:10.980 --> 18:12.450
What are the values there, comma?

18:15.040 --> 18:19.810
What we want to do is we want to go for the previous three transitions or eight for a current transition.

18:19.810 --> 18:21.460
We are going for previous three transitions.

18:21.460 --> 18:28.060
Again, let's make another loop and let's call it double G as we did in the previous problem eight.

18:29.660 --> 18:32.340
So what is the condition in which so far?

18:32.480 --> 18:34.130
Let me complete the records of relation.

18:34.130 --> 18:38.300
Then we write the conditions or it will be DPA, double g, which is the previous.

18:38.360 --> 18:47.450
So the previous is W minus eight plus E, it is the cost, which is the point of happiness for the current

18:47.960 --> 18:48.260
job.

18:48.680 --> 18:52.010
So this should not be agreed by because what I did was to zero.

18:52.010 --> 18:54.620
We have double digit goes to zero eight.

18:55.370 --> 18:57.290
That means two activities are being performed.

18:57.650 --> 19:00.950
What I'll do is I'll see if J is not equals to g g.

19:01.580 --> 19:08.000
That means the activities are different then only do this part that divides maximum of this.

19:08.330 --> 19:13.790
And guys, there's no need to fill it with minus one or zero initially because whenever you declare

19:13.790 --> 19:19.920
anything in the heap memory or globally, it is pre-filled with zeros.

19:21.170 --> 19:21.530
Great.

19:22.080 --> 19:22.550
Let's.

19:22.790 --> 19:24.800
So we have got this now.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.340
What should be the final answer?

19:27.970 --> 19:29.020
Final answer should be.

19:30.120 --> 19:30.930
The maximum of.

19:31.840 --> 19:37.150
Whatever the three activities are being performed on the last day to hear them on the last day we had

19:37.150 --> 19:37.870
three activities.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.470
150 was the best court activity.

19:40.480 --> 19:47.500
One was done when it was a best scoring activity, one was done and two ended and it was the best quality

19:47.500 --> 19:48.100
of activity.

19:48.100 --> 19:48.760
C was done.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.660
So it was a best career choice.

19:51.700 --> 19:52.600
It will be deep.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.800
It will be maximum of the hits maker director.

19:56.870 --> 19:58.390
So it will be deep in minus one.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.350
Zero comma d.

20:01.390 --> 20:01.840
B.

20:02.790 --> 20:02.990
Okay.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.610
I think there's this another function.

20:05.610 --> 20:08.970
Let's take help of this maximum element.

20:09.450 --> 20:10.950
So let's positive deep in.

20:12.520 --> 20:13.120
So this.

20:14.170 --> 20:14.980
How can a bus?

20:17.370 --> 20:19.500
But not to be in the pen minus.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.320
And minus one.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.510
And minus one plus three.

20:27.110 --> 20:28.070
Not sure if this works.

20:30.950 --> 20:31.210
Yeah.

20:31.230 --> 20:38.630
So we go to 208 and then we'll function the children's double digit returns, a pointer to the maximum

20:38.630 --> 20:39.000
element.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.580
Similarly, we can have an element, right?

20:42.110 --> 20:42.560
I did?

20:43.310 --> 20:43.580
Yeah.

20:44.000 --> 20:44.870
It's been a long time.

20:44.880 --> 20:45.350
I didn't.

20:46.950 --> 20:47.250
Would.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.040
What we have.

20:50.040 --> 20:54.180
It is 100, 100, and this is a final when it is 46.

20:54.630 --> 20:58.950
But what I want you to do is I for all these problems, I want you to trace this back.

20:59.520 --> 21:04.860
I want you to bring all the activities that are being performed, CBP, whatever is performed on which

21:04.860 --> 21:07.530
day history is this back and print the values.

21:08.430 --> 21:09.510
That's how you don't understand.

21:09.510 --> 21:11.400
I knew programming by tracing things back.

21:12.330 --> 21:12.630
Okay.

21:13.720 --> 21:13.960
Great.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.420
And I've already shown you how to raise your back.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.250
Just write a normal function.

21:18.250 --> 21:21.850
Avoid function which will return whenever you find the right transition.

21:23.620 --> 21:25.780
So let's copy this and.

21:26.960 --> 21:27.460
Restrict.

21:30.410 --> 21:31.080
I'm retired.

21:34.770 --> 21:37.320
And this should work if I'm not having any competition errors.

21:39.980 --> 21:41.540
So it's an accepted solution.

21:41.540 --> 21:42.350
We all can see.

21:43.320 --> 21:44.220
So that's it, guys.

21:44.490 --> 21:45.540
About the third problem.

21:45.540 --> 21:48.600
And after this, we see all the variations on acid problem.

21:49.620 --> 21:49.850
By.
