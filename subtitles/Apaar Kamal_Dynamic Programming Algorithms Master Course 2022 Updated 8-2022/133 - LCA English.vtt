WEBVTT

00:00.530 --> 00:00.760
Yeah.

00:00.920 --> 00:08.210
So guys, the problem with the above approach that as using two pointers was that we were climbing one

00:08.210 --> 00:09.290
by one above, right?

00:09.950 --> 00:13.760
So now here what we'll be doing is we won't be climbing one step ahead.

00:13.760 --> 00:20.850
Now we will be using the power of the binding numbers with this hope that any any number can be written

00:20.850 --> 00:23.060
is the sum of binding numbers.

00:23.060 --> 00:26.420
That is sum of two sum of powers of two eight.

00:26.570 --> 00:31.010
That means ten considered energy +25 isn't an it's four plus one and so on.

00:32.030 --> 00:36.440
The binding numbers, I hope you are very well aware of the binding numbers because that is the basic

00:36.440 --> 00:37.700
foundation of computer science.

00:38.330 --> 00:38.590
Eight.

00:39.650 --> 00:39.930
Okay.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.700
So what we'll do is when whenever we're asked to find that.

00:43.700 --> 00:49.100
Okay, find, see of you and we then first of all, we know the difference between the depth of you

00:49.100 --> 00:53.000
and we will simply cover that up by using binary numbers.

00:53.390 --> 00:54.620
I tell you what.

00:54.620 --> 00:55.370
How and why.

00:55.910 --> 00:56.360
And.

00:57.530 --> 00:58.640
After that, we will.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.720
Like over the next steps too, with the help of binding.

01:03.280 --> 01:09.460
Let's understand how they the first of all, the prerequisites for this stable body, the spice table

01:09.460 --> 01:12.550
and what is binding lifting do not variable by lifting.

01:12.550 --> 01:19.330
It's very clear we are lifting our self in binding numbers eight instead of going 111 step ahead.

01:19.330 --> 01:21.190
We are moving in powers of two.

01:22.570 --> 01:22.930
So.

01:23.910 --> 01:28.020
Let's find out what it is by staple gun.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.410
So, first of all, I think I should give you a use of it.

01:31.890 --> 01:36.660
If I if I give you a use of it, then you will be able to understand this basketball very nicely.

01:37.260 --> 01:37.980
Is let's see.

01:38.340 --> 01:44.220
I want to I want to I want 11 and I want to jump deep earrings above.

01:45.630 --> 01:47.060
More three buildings above me.

01:47.430 --> 01:49.860
Plus, jump, stick, jump and third jump.

01:50.520 --> 01:51.600
They still here.

01:51.870 --> 01:58.560
If I like it natively, by using the value we have, then it will take us over three time rate.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.830
But how contributed in its binary numbers?

02:01.830 --> 02:02.820
It is two plus one.

02:03.940 --> 02:08.110
Right to the power one let's do to the power zero.

02:08.110 --> 02:10.240
That is equal to three in binding numbers.

02:10.660 --> 02:12.220
What we do is we are on 11.

02:12.640 --> 02:20.620
We will climb to do to do the power first period of 11, which is five will climb directly because that's

02:20.620 --> 02:21.940
what spots people will do.

02:22.270 --> 02:26.770
It will store all the utility power eight periods of every note.

02:28.430 --> 02:28.670
Eight.

02:29.000 --> 02:29.330
So.

02:30.300 --> 02:30.720
Don't worry.

02:30.720 --> 02:31.620
It's very interesting.

02:31.620 --> 02:37.080
And we will be responsible for this whole tree and understand it in more detail.

02:37.380 --> 02:42.060
Now, guys, we are on five eight, so four five which bit into a need for fight.

02:42.090 --> 02:46.620
I need to do the power zero speed four five which is what is to dibaba zero.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.570
It is one that means the first variant of I.

02:49.830 --> 02:50.340
Always.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.460
So after this, I'll simply go to.

02:54.150 --> 02:57.140
What happens is I have a I have a difference.

02:57.140 --> 02:59.750
I want to climb this difference.

02:59.750 --> 02:59.980
Right.

03:00.020 --> 03:01.190
So this difference can be there.

03:01.190 --> 03:02.990
Dennis is was off to.

03:05.330 --> 03:05.570
Okay.

03:05.780 --> 03:09.020
So if the difference is ten, then it's simply eight plus to eight.

03:09.020 --> 03:14.330
And guys, when we trade some differences, powers of two or as a binding number, they are only log

03:14.330 --> 03:18.240
off and which they are only log of Enbridge eight.

03:18.980 --> 03:24.650
So that's what we are trying to use here that we only need log of ten jumps to move anywhere in metric

03:24.890 --> 03:29.030
only log, often five because we are claiming the powers of two eight.

03:29.150 --> 03:35.030
So no matter how big the number is, we will simply claim the powers of two and we will use less than

03:35.030 --> 03:41.510
log of in numbers eight, less than log of and jumps to move wherever we want to do it.

03:41.510 --> 03:45.550
So let's see if the difference between the depth of you in we is hundred.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.480
Then how will we climate?

03:48.660 --> 03:55.260
Firstly, on whichever nerd I am, I simply go to its 64th period because it's faster, but I already

03:55.260 --> 03:57.060
stored what is it, 64th period.

03:57.510 --> 03:58.310
How will it stored?

03:58.320 --> 03:59.590
I'll tell you eight.

03:59.850 --> 04:01.230
I'm just telling you the use of it.

04:01.230 --> 04:04.140
So they begin to understand where will use this possible.

04:05.220 --> 04:05.460
So.

04:06.090 --> 04:06.660
Yeah, so.

04:07.810 --> 04:13.040
I know it is true that the power six less, but can I add 32 to it?

04:13.730 --> 04:14.070
Yes.

04:14.090 --> 04:16.580
So to deliver five, it will become nine this six.

04:16.670 --> 04:16.940
Eight.

04:18.540 --> 04:21.690
And then it is to the the power to that is for.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.640
64 players are ready to play for this.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.580
I hope this is very clear, guys, that if I want if I want any, not you.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.870
I want to go to its hundredth period.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.480
And so, Ed, jump on one step ahead.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.900
Like climb above and go to the hundredth period.

04:40.260 --> 04:42.210
All what I can do is I can simply.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.380
Jump in terms of binding numbers.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.400
That is directly down to its to do with our expedient.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.430
Then it's totally over 50%.

04:52.430 --> 04:54.800
And then it's who do they bother to experience?

04:54.800 --> 04:57.140
So the total jump jumps out really.

04:57.140 --> 04:58.630
And how much distance I have covered.

04:58.700 --> 04:59.690
Hundred distance.

05:01.460 --> 05:04.430
So we we are using the powers of 19 numbers here again.

05:04.520 --> 05:08.000
They in every number can be written, some off, powers off.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.400
So this is binding lifting.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.140
I know how to do it.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.500
Let's first of all understand how to calculate spice table.

05:15.770 --> 05:15.950
Okay.

05:16.670 --> 05:17.420
So as we know.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.050
Let me.

05:20.910 --> 05:22.050
I did two spots.

05:24.560 --> 05:25.700
Again, it's very easy.

05:25.730 --> 05:27.980
It just takes one lines of code.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.370
What's happening here.

05:32.980 --> 05:36.810
It just takes one lines of code to figure out the spice table.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.430
It needs a total understanding.

05:39.890 --> 05:42.460
Also, let's understand how to calculate the spice table.

05:43.390 --> 05:44.740
So sparse tables.

05:46.560 --> 05:47.400
Length will be.

05:47.610 --> 05:48.630
Let's say it's a day.

05:48.630 --> 05:50.460
Well, as we can easily see, it's a metrics say.

05:51.510 --> 05:52.590
It will be a metrics.

05:53.900 --> 05:57.020
But some columns, letters and columns in the end.

05:57.020 --> 05:58.040
Rows and columns.

06:01.160 --> 06:01.340
Eight.

06:02.130 --> 06:03.020
Andrews.

06:06.060 --> 06:06.320
Okay.

06:06.510 --> 06:11.460
What does let's let me name this table as parent only.

06:11.460 --> 06:12.770
Right, because that's ridiculous.

06:12.780 --> 06:12.980
Okay.

06:13.830 --> 06:15.600
But parent icon magic.

06:16.230 --> 06:18.450
What will this tell mean?

06:18.750 --> 06:21.510
What is parent either in a spice table?

06:22.140 --> 06:22.950
In a spot table?

06:22.950 --> 06:26.310
What does a row, i.e., and column did it present?

06:26.700 --> 06:28.650
It represents the.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.790
Due to the power jet parent off.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.070
A very simple.

06:38.450 --> 06:42.590
What does it represent to the Devolver digital parent of a bull?

06:42.680 --> 06:44.050
So let me like name this.

06:44.060 --> 06:47.780
One, two, three, four, five, six, one and.

06:48.680 --> 06:49.970
Here we have this.

06:51.580 --> 06:52.360
Really big table.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.340
So I put for that one.

06:54.660 --> 06:54.960
Okay.

06:55.540 --> 06:55.810
Okay.

06:55.810 --> 06:59.050
They'll bring forward when I'll be running the gold medal won the gold.

06:59.050 --> 07:00.820
I'll bring the table right before understanding.

07:00.820 --> 07:03.370
Let's make a small pool.

07:04.660 --> 07:07.570
Well, right now I'm just feeling the values and then we will see that.

07:07.570 --> 07:13.630
How will we use dynamic programming in filling up all the the complete table before?

07:14.590 --> 07:15.730
And it's a five.

07:15.730 --> 07:16.540
And then let's see.

07:17.510 --> 07:17.900
Six.

07:18.990 --> 07:19.260
Well.

07:20.460 --> 07:20.730
So.

07:21.150 --> 07:23.340
Yeah, let me fill this one to end.

07:23.850 --> 07:29.220
See, we won't be needing more than three because we have only six nodes, so we have only six nodes.

07:29.220 --> 07:31.140
Then what can be the maximum height of the tree?

07:31.260 --> 07:32.460
If it's a team, right?

07:32.880 --> 07:34.680
If it's a twin, what is the height of it?

07:34.770 --> 07:37.440
Log of orphan age.

07:37.440 --> 07:37.860
So what?

07:37.950 --> 07:39.240
Height of orphan?

07:39.450 --> 07:40.520
What should be the M?

07:40.530 --> 07:40.850
Yeah.

07:40.890 --> 07:43.680
What should be the volume size that we need?

07:44.130 --> 07:45.780
It should be log off and.

07:46.880 --> 07:47.420
Hello, girlfriend.

07:47.420 --> 07:47.840
Because.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.310
What is the zeroth column means?

07:51.390 --> 07:53.750
It is during the first question and of every note.

07:53.750 --> 07:54.630
What does the one mean?

07:54.650 --> 07:59.930
It is drawing the second bit of every note where the stream part is doing this, filling the fourth

07:59.930 --> 08:05.300
reading of every note eight due to the above edit or the stream in third column that it is drawing the

08:05.300 --> 08:08.030
eighth period of every note eight days.

08:08.540 --> 08:08.810
So.

08:10.230 --> 08:15.900
In the worst case, I can go to log off and then that will be storing that and it's parent of any of

08:15.900 --> 08:17.700
the log of and column.

08:18.350 --> 08:20.010
Well, let's fill this table.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.810
Guess what?

08:21.810 --> 08:24.840
Every note we want the first reading to be failure rate.

08:25.230 --> 08:25.590
So.

08:27.420 --> 08:27.630
Yeah.

08:27.640 --> 08:28.380
Let's take the color.

08:28.380 --> 08:28.740
Right.

08:29.280 --> 08:29.710
And.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.010
Well, one word is the first word into this.

08:32.100 --> 08:37.620
Zero four to the first word in is one or three the first word and this one for for the first print is

08:37.620 --> 08:38.940
two or five.

08:38.940 --> 08:42.390
The first word in this or and for six, the first period is two.

08:43.080 --> 08:47.820
I hope the first column is very clearly showing the first reading of it right now, guys.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.780
Next, fill the second Colombia.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.630
What does the column number one means?

08:54.500 --> 08:56.990
Tell me what to do about one spinning off.

08:56.990 --> 08:59.780
I i is that one number or is truly about one?

08:59.780 --> 09:01.460
It is second parent of I.

09:03.220 --> 09:03.470
Hey.

09:03.910 --> 09:04.390
So, guys.

09:06.260 --> 09:09.410
Do I think I should fill this first and then we'll discuss how to.

09:10.430 --> 09:12.470
Like doing using dining programming.

09:13.340 --> 09:14.900
What is the second brand of a.

09:16.330 --> 09:20.920
We can see in the second period of -0, second period of do is also zero.

09:21.400 --> 09:26.110
The component of the result to zero figure is second, third, fourth.

09:26.110 --> 09:31.990
All the parents of all the nodes, the if the pairing number is more than the root nor radiates going

09:31.990 --> 09:32.890
above the root node.

09:32.890 --> 09:34.990
So we have a imaginary parent of us.

09:35.310 --> 09:36.220
It is the zero node.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.070
Zero is not a parent of every anyone, but we know that it is an invalid type value.

09:42.670 --> 09:45.700
So we are storing zero there because they do not have any bidding.

09:46.900 --> 09:49.600
But what is a second parent of what it is?

09:49.600 --> 09:49.930
One.

09:50.140 --> 09:50.680
What is.

09:54.370 --> 09:56.470
The grandparent of five, it is two.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.550
That can be enough.

09:57.550 --> 09:58.300
Six is one.

09:58.510 --> 09:59.740
I hope this is very clear.

10:00.100 --> 10:06.880
Now let's build a third column, which is to read about towards the end of a day what it is to deliver

10:06.890 --> 10:07.870
to its parent of three.

10:08.380 --> 10:13.690
So for one it will be 04204302 over two means four.

10:13.690 --> 10:13.980
Right?

10:13.990 --> 10:15.340
So this fourth pattern of eight.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.410
And what is the fourth minute offer?

10:19.140 --> 10:19.590
Zero.

10:20.970 --> 10:22.170
Footprint of five.

10:23.300 --> 10:23.690
Zero.

10:25.520 --> 10:25.830
Eight.

10:28.420 --> 10:31.570
And what is the fourth spirit of six again?

10:31.570 --> 10:31.900
Zero.

10:32.020 --> 10:33.970
So, guys, after this will all get zeros.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.210
I hope you're getting the standard.

10:39.240 --> 10:45.000
So what is the size of the table and gross and bare amis log in and in the log n is the size of the

10:45.450 --> 10:46.740
table that is, and log in.

10:47.920 --> 10:54.250
Well, guys, now let us figure out how how to fill it in a dynamic programming, how to use DP here,

10:54.250 --> 10:59.020
how to fill this by using dining programming and it's very easy to understand it.

10:59.350 --> 11:00.630
I o.

11:00.730 --> 11:01.150
C.

11:02.660 --> 11:08.180
What every note we have to be afraid of the first meeting we have the first waiting for a note.

11:08.630 --> 11:14.210
We have we have failed the fourth grade in for all its parent and all its ancestors that we worry about

11:14.630 --> 11:15.560
right now.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.830
Guys understand this part.

11:20.150 --> 11:22.580
If I say that parent of icon Maggi.

11:24.380 --> 11:27.110
That means if I am on some vertex, I.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.770
I want to find out.

11:29.770 --> 11:31.060
It's due to the power.

11:32.900 --> 11:33.440
Spitting.

11:36.670 --> 11:37.660
It would be deep poverty.

11:38.470 --> 11:44.020
So I'm on somewhere, Dixie, and I want to find out due to the power it's been offered to.

11:44.020 --> 11:51.010
And I already know that I've calculated all the parents that I've failed, all the parents of all these

11:51.010 --> 11:52.480
nodes for all the ancestors.

11:53.210 --> 11:53.230
Okay.

11:53.590 --> 12:00.690
That means if I'm on fat, if I'm on food, I filled the complete row of one, the complete row of two.

12:00.700 --> 12:06.670
That means I already know all the parents of one order to keep our eye, each parent of ones to keep

12:06.670 --> 12:08.020
our Jupiter of two.

12:08.170 --> 12:09.190
And now I'm on for.

12:10.280 --> 12:17.270
Made by because I will be doing it in a DFS v, but whichever note I go to, I will simply fill it stable

12:17.630 --> 12:18.380
the row of it.

12:18.620 --> 12:23.390
Because for any note, let's say I'm going on node number you right?

12:23.510 --> 12:31.020
And with the ancestor of it, I've already filled the trophy so that I can use the row of we in rule.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.830
You will because in DFS we know this property of DFS rated.

12:35.870 --> 12:41.240
So whenever we come to a note, we've already figured we've already been through its end sisters.

12:41.420 --> 12:42.800
Then only we can come to any node.

12:43.700 --> 12:46.030
Well, before any note, I want to find out.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.240
It's to keep our dear.

12:48.420 --> 12:53.420
Again, I say that what I to keep our dear period will be equal to.

12:56.220 --> 12:57.000
Parent of.

12:59.390 --> 13:00.020
Let's see.

13:01.430 --> 13:02.660
Parent of I.

13:03.790 --> 13:04.990
Ramadi, minus one.

13:06.380 --> 13:07.160
Understand this.

13:08.040 --> 13:08.850
And do minus.

13:13.690 --> 13:14.530
Think about this case.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.630
What does this statement means?

13:16.900 --> 13:22.660
That firstly, what we are saying is that we have actually broken down this to keep our Jane to two

13:22.660 --> 13:23.130
parts.

13:23.230 --> 13:25.840
That is to keep our Jane minus one.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.550
And to keep our Jane minus.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.570
But right before.

13:32.080 --> 13:36.640
But what we are doing is we are trying to fill that role of any note one by one.

13:37.030 --> 13:42.160
First of all, for any note will fill its zeroth parent, then fill will fill.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.370
It took about one period.

13:43.810 --> 13:48.040
They look for any icon magic that is for any say like magic.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.710
We know we have already filled a comedy minus one.

13:51.780 --> 13:52.980
We've already left.

13:52.980 --> 13:56.610
Well, you write that is this a comedy minus one?

13:56.940 --> 13:59.140
And of course, this parent is like some variable.

13:59.220 --> 14:00.180
It is an ancestor.

14:00.990 --> 14:07.680
And so for all the ancestors we have for that whole complete row, we can use J minus one s that is

14:07.680 --> 14:08.730
dynamic programming rate.

14:09.730 --> 14:16.950
What we are trying to do over here is what to do to find to the power determinant of why we are seeing

14:17.280 --> 14:18.390
it is equal to.

14:20.270 --> 14:21.590
Due to the power, dear.

14:21.590 --> 14:23.510
Minus one parent of.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.410
The current corporate rate.

14:27.410 --> 14:32.810
So that that means what I'll have some to do the other day minus one parent.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.380
What that I want to find out to do with you.

14:36.380 --> 14:37.160
Minus one to be.

14:38.570 --> 14:40.840
That will be equal to that to the devour Jasmine.

14:40.840 --> 14:41.680
End of the career note.

14:41.740 --> 14:44.860
That means let me give you a very simple example.

14:45.920 --> 14:46.700
Let's see this.

14:47.450 --> 14:47.660
Okay.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.800
So what do you guys.

14:48.820 --> 14:49.490
What is it?

14:49.760 --> 14:53.750
So confident it's second period is equal to the first variant of the first parent.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.310
Two or three.

14:58.350 --> 15:01.530
If I want to find no second parents, I'm dividing two into one plus one.

15:01.950 --> 15:06.060
That means for the first parent of three, find out its first parent.

15:07.250 --> 15:07.430
Cool.

15:07.870 --> 15:09.260
Well, let's see if I want to find out.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.390
It's parent of three.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.100
Do that, you know?

15:14.130 --> 15:14.410
Right.

15:14.430 --> 15:15.530
So how will you do that?

15:15.990 --> 15:18.660
What does this line actually mean in English?

15:19.680 --> 15:20.580
It means that.

15:21.630 --> 15:22.260
For it.

15:22.260 --> 15:24.210
I'm dividing it into four plus four.

15:24.630 --> 15:26.070
I I'm seeing four three.

15:27.020 --> 15:29.680
These forward spinning, whatever it will be.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.550
Tell me, what is its fourth variant?

15:33.950 --> 15:34.190
Great.

15:34.460 --> 15:37.940
So this is how I'm using dynamic programming here.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.460
This is how this particular.

15:41.870 --> 15:45.410
Because every nation is being thumped or I go -- bidding.

15:45.890 --> 15:48.170
I notice I go my Jew minus one parent.

15:48.230 --> 15:49.820
That is doo doo doo doo minus one.

15:50.180 --> 15:53.810
And find it's true to the Babaji minus one parent, which is already calculated.

15:59.160 --> 15:59.460
Cool.

15:59.490 --> 16:04.590
So let me quote this first and then we'll come back in from this table again so that it becomes more

16:04.590 --> 16:05.250
clear to us.

16:05.940 --> 16:06.190
Hey.

16:07.360 --> 16:07.550
Good.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.190
So, yeah.

16:10.370 --> 16:14.870
This was about LCA but while a single point design.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.660
So let's edit in this quote only it will be better for us.

16:18.980 --> 16:22.970
We are performing a DFS and in this DFS only what we'll do is we'll simply.

16:24.060 --> 16:24.970
Make us positive.

16:24.970 --> 16:27.660
But this variant will now become.

16:28.900 --> 16:29.530
A bigger.

16:31.530 --> 16:31.910
Yeah.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.060
So actually.

16:35.660 --> 16:36.470
So I think.

16:39.250 --> 16:39.550
Fine.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.200
Let's erase all of this.

16:42.410 --> 16:46.880
So let me comment this out, because here the parent error is being used.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.290
But actually I'm alerting the parent daddy.

16:49.310 --> 16:49.630
Right.

16:49.850 --> 16:50.270
So.

16:52.180 --> 16:52.380
Let's.

16:52.450 --> 16:53.170
It is this only.

16:53.690 --> 16:54.240
Don't need it.

16:54.670 --> 16:55.570
Just keep this in mind.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.660
What are the things that we did when we were doing the two pointer technique?

16:59.200 --> 16:59.480
Right.

16:59.860 --> 17:03.000
So here what we have is spirit and Gamma and what will be in.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.140
Let me give an up around of em.

17:05.140 --> 17:07.510
So what will we logo when you fly around.

17:07.930 --> 17:08.980
Don't be right.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.330
Let me give it 20.

17:10.420 --> 17:16.630
So M is equal to 20 but this is the size of the parent added that is the spot stable we are calculating

17:16.630 --> 17:18.910
you need a.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.330
Well, here, let's say we have another depth pool.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.850
So let me separate it out right now.

17:26.870 --> 17:29.840
What we want to do is we want to fill up this bar stable.

17:30.440 --> 17:37.950
As I said, whenever we are, let's fill the 0 to 1 zeroth period of any node which is equal to zero

17:37.970 --> 17:38.450
is one.

17:38.450 --> 17:38.750
Right.

17:38.750 --> 17:42.350
So we are filling the first reading of every note now after this.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.500
What we'll do is we'll simply have a Ford loop.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.150
Let's move off our loop.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.630
Start from one on left side.

17:49.670 --> 17:53.660
It is equal to zero because I've taken it and explained it.

17:55.310 --> 17:59.180
Well, let's find out all the parents of the current road rage.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.650
So what is a parent of?

18:01.830 --> 18:04.080
But is current day goal to raise?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.810
It will be called the parent of.

18:07.840 --> 18:15.250
We didn't of current day minus one you guys but India minus one will be calculated right because we

18:15.250 --> 18:20.530
are starting from Jake was two one that means Jake goes through zero is calculated now when we'll move

18:20.530 --> 18:25.000
forward when J will move forward, then parentheses get a greater rate.

18:25.330 --> 18:27.970
When J is equal to two, then equals two.

18:27.970 --> 18:29.110
One is already calculated.

18:29.110 --> 18:32.290
So that is how bottom up approach of writing programming books.

18:32.920 --> 18:33.250
Right?

18:33.430 --> 18:34.510
So do not get confused.

18:34.960 --> 18:39.550
Do not run this loop in like opposite direction because we need this time.

18:40.480 --> 18:44.740
We already feel like it is fitting of current day.

18:44.740 --> 18:45.430
Minus one.

18:45.670 --> 18:46.960
It's day minus one to.

18:48.310 --> 18:50.560
Always for this guy.

18:50.570 --> 18:52.030
We wanted to do minus one bit.

18:52.210 --> 18:57.940
And of course, guys that is already filled because the DFS is already going over all these ancestors.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.670
And for all these ancestors, this parent daddy.

19:02.130 --> 19:04.490
The whole room for the transistor is already for.

19:05.580 --> 19:06.060
Always.

19:07.340 --> 19:11.780
But this is just a normal calculation for possible, a very easy calculation.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.160
This two lanes approach.

19:14.310 --> 19:16.460
So here we have calculated this positive bill.

19:16.890 --> 19:20.310
Now, let me bring this and let me.

19:20.910 --> 19:21.210
Okay.

19:21.210 --> 19:21.900
So I haven't.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.890
Rather than any of LC apart.

19:28.400 --> 19:28.680
Well.

19:28.760 --> 19:31.850
So let's bring the table.

19:31.850 --> 19:32.160
Right.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.590
So let's start from one.

19:34.490 --> 19:35.960
Let's go to how much?

19:36.830 --> 19:37.670
Well, right.

19:37.850 --> 19:41.020
And let's go over there.

19:49.230 --> 19:54.720
JAY Let's start from zero and then let's go to let's get right to that about food.

19:54.750 --> 19:55.830
Let's go to food only.

19:59.380 --> 19:59.890
The out.

20:01.350 --> 20:01.780
Parent.

20:02.310 --> 20:02.550
I.

20:04.110 --> 20:04.680
All the notes.

20:06.450 --> 20:06.720
Eight.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.550
And before this let's see out I.

20:22.050 --> 20:22.830
Well, so.

20:23.800 --> 20:27.700
Let's let's tally this with the above structural.

20:28.550 --> 20:33.050
So for one, we have all it's based on expanding to be equal to zero.

20:33.050 --> 20:33.890
It's frustrating.

20:33.890 --> 20:40.880
Sprint is the second between 2040088 parent is zero right or to the first grade in this one and that's

20:40.880 --> 20:41.840
dollar zero.

20:42.140 --> 20:44.990
But two or three again the same thing is happening.

20:45.680 --> 20:46.160
Correct.

20:46.850 --> 20:51.320
Or for the first parent is two for four we can see the first one and this doing the second better in

20:51.320 --> 20:51.770
this one.

20:52.220 --> 20:52.610
Correct.

20:53.150 --> 20:55.490
Or fifth again the same thing rate for six.

20:55.490 --> 21:00.950
Also the same thing should happen right now for seven guys, the phosphate industry.

21:01.580 --> 21:01.940
Right.

21:02.390 --> 21:04.100
And this again, but in this one.

21:04.310 --> 21:04.760
Correct.

21:05.420 --> 21:06.530
What's been in this five.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.590
And the second button is true for it.

21:10.310 --> 21:10.610
Correct.

21:11.090 --> 21:14.480
We don't have the fourth variant of it.

21:14.480 --> 21:14.810
Right.

21:15.140 --> 21:15.460
Why?

21:16.220 --> 21:19.040
Because the Ford variant of it is zero eight.

21:19.040 --> 21:23.930
So here we are not calculating first, second and third period, invigorating first, second, fourth,

21:24.200 --> 21:27.650
eight, 16th, and so on, bearing in mind the numbers.

21:28.580 --> 21:28.910
Again.

21:28.910 --> 21:30.650
Now let's go to nine and let's see.

21:30.650 --> 21:33.650
We have the fourth parent of nine, which is fine before nine.

21:33.650 --> 21:39.320
What we have is what's been envisaged seven, but it is five and what is the fourth one in this one?

21:39.650 --> 21:39.920
Okay.

21:39.920 --> 21:45.740
So you can easily see that when we were calculating the fourth variant of nine, fourth variant of nine,

21:46.280 --> 21:51.920
and what we did was tell me the second variant of nine and four that tell me the second period of it.

21:52.790 --> 21:57.260
It's basically like this nine square square instead of nine with about four.

21:58.250 --> 22:03.140
They are finding the sick in Britain and then finding it sick in Britain rather than directly finding

22:03.140 --> 22:05.870
the fourth Briton or just a grandparent of 95.

22:06.170 --> 22:08.870
And what was the fifth, fifth second Briton?

22:09.380 --> 22:11.000
It was one who.

22:12.170 --> 22:13.640
The fourth brand of nine is one.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.590
It's like half of what?

22:17.590 --> 22:22.840
All the powers of two, because by spring we have already calculated for second we need first reading

22:22.840 --> 22:25.060
before we need second reading for aid.

22:25.060 --> 22:26.500
We need food waiting and so on.

22:28.230 --> 22:28.420
Okay.

22:28.530 --> 22:31.530
So that's dynamic programming for you guys and.

22:32.650 --> 22:36.940
Very simple approach, not that hard to understand if still you have a problem with this.

22:37.780 --> 22:43.300
Like pause the video and in the values and try to understand it.

22:44.020 --> 22:45.400
Okay, then why is this working?

22:45.400 --> 22:47.830
Because all the values have been already calculated.

22:48.370 --> 22:49.600
This has been calculated.

22:50.080 --> 22:56.350
And this guy's j minus one is also calculated because this thing in sister DFS will first growing n

22:56.350 --> 22:57.640
sister than any other node.

22:58.700 --> 22:59.000
Eight.

23:00.490 --> 23:07.720
So this is like integrating the who keep our deterrent of an inordinate amount like financier.

23:11.430 --> 23:13.100
I'll be using the same bookbinder approach.

23:13.110 --> 23:15.360
So if you is equal to we.

23:16.630 --> 23:17.650
And simply written.

23:18.640 --> 23:18.940
You.

23:19.150 --> 23:22.090
Well, it's not needed, but let's say I did it now.

23:22.120 --> 23:23.430
What was the second part, guys?

23:23.440 --> 23:26.200
If depth of you see, we have all we have.

23:26.410 --> 23:27.310
We have depth, right?

23:27.520 --> 23:29.900
We are not interfering with the the particle.

23:29.980 --> 23:33.980
So depth of we if it is less in depth of you and so have you, we.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.670
So that depth of you is always less than depth of you.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.770
Now find the difference.

23:38.860 --> 23:39.670
Why the difference?

23:39.670 --> 23:40.810
It will be depth of you.

23:45.130 --> 23:46.120
Minus stepped off.

23:46.970 --> 23:47.200
We?

23:48.030 --> 23:48.470
Police.

23:49.630 --> 23:50.830
So here we have the difference.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.010
And now this what we were doing in the two pointed approach.

23:53.020 --> 23:56.960
If we have this debate, we are moving one, one step ahead in the 2.8 operation.

23:57.070 --> 23:58.910
But here we have calculated the bearings.

23:59.380 --> 23:59.660
Right.

24:00.130 --> 24:03.280
So if I want to go now, I have this difference.

24:03.310 --> 24:05.830
Let's say this difference is equal to any number of X.

24:06.660 --> 24:13.410
What I do is I break down this number and do powers of two and I keep climbing those powers of two until

24:13.720 --> 24:15.100
both of them are on the same height.

24:15.490 --> 24:15.680
Okay.

24:15.850 --> 24:19.900
So basically right now what I want to do is what this node.

24:19.900 --> 24:20.350
You.

24:21.470 --> 24:22.550
I want to go to it.

24:23.550 --> 24:25.850
Different models differ.

24:26.200 --> 24:31.770
This if I if I go to is this different, then both of the nodes will be on the same level.

24:32.960 --> 24:33.190
Okay.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.280
And, yeah.

24:35.300 --> 24:36.470
So what I do is simply.

24:37.630 --> 24:38.260
Oh, sorry.

24:40.110 --> 24:40.740
Let's see.

24:41.140 --> 24:41.440
Do.

24:42.540 --> 24:42.790
Eight.

24:43.050 --> 24:45.030
It started from a minus one.

24:45.960 --> 24:46.620
What does that mean?

24:46.680 --> 24:47.640
The low part.

24:47.820 --> 24:48.380
Not part.

24:48.390 --> 24:50.730
Because now we are breaking down this into.

24:53.170 --> 24:54.280
J minus one study.

24:54.700 --> 24:55.030
J.

24:58.570 --> 25:00.370
It start from a minus one.

25:00.370 --> 25:05.590
And what I will say is if the weight of the number is said, that means if.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.790
Okay, now I'm just doing some normal word manipulation.

25:09.790 --> 25:11.320
I don't think that it's.

25:11.580 --> 25:12.790
It needs explanation.

25:13.360 --> 25:14.070
Very easy.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.270
Normal manipulation.

25:16.720 --> 25:17.140
If.

25:18.780 --> 25:22.290
If they shift e and.

25:23.760 --> 25:24.120
One.

25:25.380 --> 25:32.310
That means the district of Davis said get rid of beef is dead.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.920
So, guys, if the dead word of Davis said, that means if I have a number ten, then it is equal to

25:37.920 --> 25:39.200
10108.

25:39.420 --> 25:44.190
In binary that means it's 0123.

25:44.190 --> 25:46.770
That means it's hard to say and it's possible to say.

25:46.800 --> 25:51.420
So the trade is equal to two to our three best to do power one, which is ten.

25:52.230 --> 25:52.420
Right.

25:53.040 --> 25:57.630
So if that did the British set, then simply use equal to print off.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.560
You Yokohama G.

26:02.790 --> 26:07.950
Race frenetically claimed that our beating of you ain't.

26:08.250 --> 26:12.960
What happens is let's if I want to find their 10th parent, then it will simply say that okay, you

26:12.990 --> 26:16.100
is equal to parent of you three.

26:16.440 --> 26:23.970
That means now I've gone it's I've gone to the two year period of about three parent of you.

26:24.690 --> 26:27.240
And after this, what will happen winning of you?

26:28.280 --> 26:28.680
Bummer.

26:28.760 --> 26:32.030
But after both operation, you will be able to.

26:33.420 --> 26:33.780
It's.

26:34.460 --> 26:35.090
And Spirit.

26:35.810 --> 26:36.290
Thanks.

26:37.740 --> 26:39.660
That's a minor lifting for you.

26:40.550 --> 26:40.850
Eight.

26:41.770 --> 26:42.220
Go ahead.

26:43.120 --> 26:47.170
Towards the end of this loop goes, it is a minus one.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.160
And what is them here?

26:48.250 --> 26:50.380
Log of an approximately log of an.

26:51.400 --> 26:51.670
Well.

26:52.270 --> 26:55.390
And after this, I have known you in.

26:56.710 --> 27:01.090
You and we are on the same level.

27:02.080 --> 27:02.860
Right now.

27:02.860 --> 27:04.690
What I need to do is if they're on the same level.

27:06.590 --> 27:10.340
I want to keep climbing them until they reach the same.

27:10.340 --> 27:10.880
No rate.

27:11.210 --> 27:11.930
But what's better?

27:12.230 --> 27:12.890
What's better?

27:13.220 --> 27:13.630
What?

27:13.640 --> 27:16.640
What's the other thing that I can do if I want?

27:18.030 --> 27:20.790
Both of them do this the same note again.

27:20.790 --> 27:22.120
I lose the money lifting them.

27:22.820 --> 27:24.720
I see this.

27:29.340 --> 27:29.640
Okay.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.930
Let's take this example only.

27:35.250 --> 27:35.880
Understand this.

27:35.880 --> 27:40.380
It's again, an easy thing to understand, and it will just hardly take 2 minutes.

27:41.500 --> 27:45.070
So here is a new thing that let's see if I'm on it.

27:45.070 --> 27:48.640
And if I'm one of 12, I want to go to one eight.

27:49.030 --> 27:50.260
What would be better to use?

27:50.260 --> 27:57.490
I will simply go to two at this point that I want you to go to two and I want to go to the right.

27:57.490 --> 28:00.580
And how will I go from here to two and three?

28:01.060 --> 28:02.800
I will simply see if.

28:03.520 --> 28:04.540
Let me put it.

28:07.490 --> 28:10.460
There are some things which we understand after looking at the code.

28:11.510 --> 28:13.040
But what I say is if.

28:14.130 --> 28:21.080
Veering off you g if it is not equal to veering off.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.160
We do understand this guys.

28:23.610 --> 28:26.490
Then I simply say usually goes to opinion wg and.

28:30.240 --> 28:33.000
B is equal to parent of B.

28:33.980 --> 28:34.280
Yeah.

28:34.790 --> 28:35.630
To see you guys.

28:35.870 --> 28:37.010
It's a very nice thing.

28:37.460 --> 28:38.360
Hey, I.

28:38.370 --> 28:42.950
What I wanted to do was I wanted to climb as above as possible.

28:43.490 --> 28:45.410
But I want the lowest common ancestor.

28:45.440 --> 28:51.820
So what's the difference between other ancestors and the lowest common insistence that from there,

28:52.010 --> 28:55.550
just the down child of the lowest common ancestor.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.380
Both of this child are different.

28:58.100 --> 28:58.420
Eight.

28:58.610 --> 29:04.670
That means if I'm able to go to this node and I'm able to go to this node, then I can simply.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.690
Their parent is equal to the lowest common ancestors.

29:10.050 --> 29:16.240
Before that, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to go in the powers of two from a very high number,

29:16.240 --> 29:16.580
right?

29:16.590 --> 29:21.180
So to do the power and minus one will be really very high because I won't be so destroyed.

29:21.180 --> 29:22.230
About 22 standard.

29:22.230 --> 29:22.980
About five.

29:24.140 --> 29:28.010
So both of eight into a standard above five, but it will be very high.

29:28.940 --> 29:29.780
They will be equal.

29:29.930 --> 29:31.910
So, guys, I don't want you and me to go there.

29:31.910 --> 29:32.660
Right, because.

29:33.740 --> 29:36.080
We don't have an AC over there now.

29:36.350 --> 29:42.680
Again, pretty one and minus two, then minus three and minus four and will be coming down for the first

29:42.680 --> 29:43.040
time.

29:43.430 --> 29:49.280
We find that okay, both of their spirit, the Nordic, but then we'll simply make them equal to that.

29:49.330 --> 29:53.210
There would keep our jets bearing right where this condition holds.

29:53.960 --> 29:57.310
That parent of huge is equal value parent of BD.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.510
So why are we doing this?

29:59.750 --> 30:00.320
Because.

30:01.290 --> 30:08.430
We want to climb to these nodes, these particular nodes, just just the nodes below my lowest common

30:08.430 --> 30:08.880
ancestor.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.050
And how can I climb them?

30:10.470 --> 30:12.630
I actually do not know their difference rate.

30:13.770 --> 30:16.470
I do not know the difference between these levels.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.640
But what's the best way to find out the difference of these levels?

30:22.150 --> 30:24.400
Just climbing powers of two and three.

30:24.400 --> 30:24.910
You can.

30:25.780 --> 30:26.100
Hey.

30:27.060 --> 30:29.370
So that's what we are trying to do here.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.370
We are just climbing in powers of two.

30:32.290 --> 30:37.210
If we are able to claim that if their parents are not equal, just claim if not equal, just claim,

30:37.210 --> 30:38.650
not equal, just claim and so on.

30:39.290 --> 30:39.340
Okay.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.380
So let me give you an example.

30:43.090 --> 30:43.600
Let's see.

30:43.900 --> 30:45.130
We had some ancestor.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.900
LC Aishwarya Rai.

30:49.770 --> 30:51.540
But listen to this carefully, guys.

30:53.180 --> 30:56.600
Because this is completely based on binding number now and.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.920
Some of you might not be getting this.

31:00.390 --> 31:05.780
So we have this letter, we have some notes, and this is a letter and part one.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.480
And then again a part.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.010
And then this is a you to note.

31:09.700 --> 31:12.160
And similarly, guys, this is the vietnam id.

31:13.000 --> 31:13.810
We have two notes.

31:13.810 --> 31:16.120
You kn we know they're on the same level.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.670
I want to go to these notes.

31:19.630 --> 31:22.990
Let's say the differences and we don't know the world.

31:22.990 --> 31:24.220
We don't know what is the difference.

31:24.400 --> 31:30.070
But let's say this then for the sake of understanding is what happens is when we move into one of two.

31:31.190 --> 31:31.940
What will happen.

31:32.930 --> 31:33.560
He will say that.

31:33.950 --> 31:35.510
You will say that to do the power.

31:37.080 --> 31:41.550
What will be you use 16th period and what will be with 16?

31:42.480 --> 31:46.140
They will be will because ten is of course less than 16.

31:46.920 --> 31:49.620
This is your used in training day.

31:49.740 --> 31:51.390
This is vs 10th period.

31:52.830 --> 31:53.130
These.

31:53.220 --> 32:00.480
This is use 11th variant and also vs 11th variant because you envision on the same height you will 16

32:00.480 --> 32:02.100
variant, it will be equal.

32:02.130 --> 32:03.300
So we won't be going there.

32:03.660 --> 32:04.970
But what will be use it.

32:05.230 --> 32:08.400
Now after 16, it will come late in the loop.

32:09.900 --> 32:11.700
But what is unwise it period.

32:11.850 --> 32:13.200
They will be somewhere over here.

32:14.770 --> 32:16.570
That means they're not equal, right?

32:16.900 --> 32:17.620
They're not equal.

32:17.620 --> 32:19.180
Both are parents and are not equal.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.310
So we will simply claim here.

32:21.310 --> 32:24.100
So now you is equal to this and we are equal to this.

32:24.460 --> 32:28.420
Now what will be guys use for swearing and we for swearing.

32:28.930 --> 32:32.170
If we are over here, guys then use for swearing will be equal.

32:32.170 --> 32:33.040
Do somewhat here.

32:34.210 --> 32:38.340
The burden of that is because if this is 11 to this is the 12th period.

32:39.740 --> 32:39.940
Yeah.

32:40.130 --> 32:42.330
And we are right now on the use it period.

32:42.350 --> 32:44.970
So this is the new you and the new light.

32:46.090 --> 32:47.490
We have climbed the earth, period.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.050
Now we are checking for the fourth spirit.

32:49.120 --> 32:52.210
So again, the fourth parent is equal, so we don't have to climb there.

32:52.630 --> 32:57.430
Now, after that, we will take the youths to earth period so we can see that used to it, but it will

32:57.430 --> 32:57.910
be equal.

32:59.480 --> 33:01.490
But they used to it better than we used to.

33:01.490 --> 33:02.690
It's been and will not be equal.

33:02.690 --> 33:08.780
The second interview in the this interview will not be equal because that is equal to the 10th period

33:09.620 --> 33:13.970
because we have already claimed to date parent eight and we are talking about its second bidder.

33:13.970 --> 33:15.710
No, look that are you.

33:15.950 --> 33:19.730
I hope we are getting this divided and we go to 16 invited and we go to four.

33:20.210 --> 33:20.840
Why are we going?

33:20.840 --> 33:21.950
Only do eight and two.

33:23.330 --> 33:25.610
Because we have to catch up to ten.

33:26.550 --> 33:28.860
Hey, we don't know the difference, but.

33:29.930 --> 33:32.900
We know one thing that both of their parents are not equal.

33:33.320 --> 33:37.190
That means they are in there between Elsie and the root node.

33:37.370 --> 33:38.570
And we don't have to go there.

33:38.930 --> 33:43.880
We have to go just down of NC eight and this condition will.

33:44.890 --> 33:45.790
Make us rich.

33:45.940 --> 33:48.160
Just down side of the road.

33:48.190 --> 33:49.390
So what will be done over here?

33:49.420 --> 33:51.340
What will be dance here will be paid off.

33:52.090 --> 33:52.870
You zero.

33:54.310 --> 33:54.760
Well, yes.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.500
Or it can also be.

33:56.500 --> 34:03.790
Well, the parent of V0, the first variant of the note that I read in the first print of this note,

34:03.790 --> 34:07.960
or I read in the first print of this note, both of them will be a better answer.

34:09.160 --> 34:09.320
Well.

34:09.460 --> 34:14.230
So by using by lifting, I went above and by again using vinyl lifting, I.

34:15.270 --> 34:15.710
And this.

34:15.990 --> 34:19.190
I found out these two notes would just beat anybody else.

34:19.200 --> 34:19.350
You.

34:20.440 --> 34:20.710
Well.

34:21.770 --> 34:23.240
It's been this and.

34:25.220 --> 34:25.970
It's printed.

34:27.800 --> 34:28.150
Again.

34:28.150 --> 34:32.050
What we have is by doing it, let's see if it's working or not, if there are some mistakes in this

34:32.050 --> 34:32.410
or not.

34:33.040 --> 34:33.440
Uh.

34:33.550 --> 34:34.480
912.

34:36.030 --> 34:36.390
Okay.

34:37.260 --> 34:38.280
Before 912.

34:38.580 --> 34:39.960
The giant is one.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.140
Who is the child for not Dannon eight and 911.

34:45.140 --> 34:45.560
The child.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.540
The it's it.

34:48.610 --> 34:49.160
Always.

34:49.180 --> 34:57.070
So I'm doing the same thing here as in the previous problem, but just using some using the advantages

34:57.070 --> 35:01.390
of binding numbers, like how binding numbers are advantages for us.

35:02.150 --> 35:05.440
I like how I can log off and.

35:06.740 --> 35:07.280
Come to us.

35:07.280 --> 35:07.640
For us.

35:08.420 --> 35:09.860
What's the complexity of this?

35:10.280 --> 35:11.150
And it's you finding.

35:11.150 --> 35:11.390
No.

35:13.420 --> 35:14.140
It is simply.

35:16.330 --> 35:26.230
Initially we have done a recalculation, so we are performing in or in the office with roof and a loop

35:26.230 --> 35:28.300
inside it so it becomes off m.

35:30.480 --> 35:30.970
Into.

35:31.210 --> 35:37.420
And this is the complexity of the device more the complexity of an as yet for one query what we are

35:37.420 --> 35:40.600
doing in this we are moving m times here and we are moving m times.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.420
You are nothing related to n so it is off.

35:46.230 --> 35:49.110
Already two of M m is equal to Logan.

35:50.380 --> 35:52.230
Because we won't be used.

35:52.360 --> 35:55.610
We won't need more than log in feelings of any.

35:57.380 --> 36:00.060
Well, this was everything about.

36:01.620 --> 36:02.850
Lowest common ancestor.

36:02.850 --> 36:04.590
Grace, I have told you every approach.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.860
There are more approaches to in there.

36:07.440 --> 36:07.980
There are like.

36:09.200 --> 36:12.680
Much difficult to understand, but these are the best ones.

36:12.690 --> 36:16.280
You know, by using this approach, every problem of yours can be solved.

36:17.660 --> 36:19.250
Well, so.

36:21.110 --> 36:26.680
This is like an NCAA finding and I find I found you in LCA, so let's print out the land of the bathroom.

36:27.180 --> 36:30.320
You do v well, so let's lint.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.140
From you.

36:35.040 --> 36:38.970
To me, this lecture is a little longer, so do not.

36:38.970 --> 36:40.200
But it's interesting too.

36:41.280 --> 36:47.490
Let's say I want to find the land from 9 to 12, the paths from 9 to 12, which I have made this function

36:47.490 --> 36:51.060
call land from your do we land from your domain?

36:51.060 --> 36:54.090
Let's have two terms here you and me eight.

36:54.240 --> 36:57.390
So let's finance you bought it at sea of your do.

36:57.390 --> 36:59.220
It is equal to LCA, you and me.

36:59.220 --> 37:04.740
We have already written the LC apart already perform the DFS, which will calculate the sports metrics

37:05.430 --> 37:06.480
we have this year.

37:06.540 --> 37:06.870
Right.

37:06.870 --> 37:08.280
So what is the length from you do v?

37:08.850 --> 37:09.570
It is simply.

37:11.500 --> 37:20.050
Depth of you plus depth of V minus during the depth of LCA range or depth of LCA.

37:26.130 --> 37:26.610
Well, this.

37:27.510 --> 37:29.400
So the length of it is seven.

37:29.400 --> 37:31.200
So let's take it from nine.

37:31.460 --> 37:34.770
But one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight.

37:34.770 --> 37:39.920
So the pardon decision let's take for any some of the buts and.

37:43.590 --> 37:45.930
410 in it, the bodies falling.

37:45.940 --> 37:46.820
One, two, three, four.

37:46.830 --> 37:47.870
Exactly right by him.

37:47.880 --> 37:53.400
Because from 10 to 1 then and this three from 8 to 1, the depth three, four, three plus three, six.

37:53.880 --> 37:58.560
Now it's a break two times it's here because that gleaned from as near to the road is being included

37:58.560 --> 38:00.960
two times what we subjected to from it.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.180
We got 48.

38:04.770 --> 38:09.000
So again, we have found the lens from YouTube in of one time only.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.980
So this takes off one time only.

38:11.790 --> 38:17.700
Hey, so guys, we will share with you some practice problems which you can try to like figure this

38:17.700 --> 38:18.750
whole LC apart.

38:18.840 --> 38:22.860
And it's not big, it's very easy and we haven't used much here.

38:22.860 --> 38:24.750
A dead patent, nothing else.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.490
Nothing is late.

38:27.630 --> 38:29.340
And this is a small school.

38:29.550 --> 38:30.930
If you want to find an NLC.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.640
In so much less time.

38:34.820 --> 38:38.260
It's about optimizations rate base for computer programming.

38:39.220 --> 38:41.230
You see in the next tutorial, guys.

38:41.230 --> 38:41.620
Thank you.
