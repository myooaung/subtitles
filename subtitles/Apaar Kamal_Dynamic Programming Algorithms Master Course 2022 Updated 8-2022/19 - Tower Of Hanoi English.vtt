00:00.740 --> 00:00.870
Now.

00:00.950 --> 00:08.930
Everyone, welcome to one of the greatest problems application and rule resolving the tower of no problem.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.160
You do not know about it.

00:10.680 --> 00:13.190
It's a very simple problem.

00:13.760 --> 00:20.180
I first met this problem in a movie called it was Rise of the Planet of the Apes.

00:21.260 --> 00:23.840
So what what is the point of this problem?

00:24.470 --> 00:30.560
This problem is simple, but that you have brought dots initially.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.280
You can see we have to.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.300
You wrote ABC.

00:34.190 --> 00:36.500
And you have and disc.

00:38.950 --> 00:41.790
And you can see these are the full disk initially.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.240
One, two, three, four, eight.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.080
Where do you go?

00:44.230 --> 00:48.190
What do you have to do is you have to place these and disk.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.770
You have to pick these and disk and place this disk from right here to right.

00:54.490 --> 00:58.150
And you can use rugby be what's the catch here?

00:58.630 --> 01:01.900
The catch here is some of you might be wondering, like, just pick it up and place it.

01:01.910 --> 01:02.140
No.

01:02.950 --> 01:06.970
So the catch is you can just pick up one disk at a time.

01:07.330 --> 01:09.130
And the second thing is, you can.

01:10.150 --> 01:12.130
Only place.

01:12.130 --> 01:16.840
A small desk on the top of the on the top of the bigger desk.

01:17.380 --> 01:23.500
That means you can not, you know, place A small desk on B and then a bigger desk on B and then A more

01:23.500 --> 01:24.280
bigger this.

01:24.970 --> 01:25.930
This is not possible.

01:27.180 --> 01:31.260
Smallest can only be on the top of another bigger disk.

01:32.220 --> 01:32.940
We have three roads.

01:32.940 --> 01:34.860
We have endless in our case and is for.

01:35.800 --> 01:43.780
And what we have to do is we have to please our leaders from a to Nazi by using not be afraid, but

01:43.780 --> 01:45.310
what they mean by using our means.

01:45.310 --> 01:46.900
I can use abroad means anyway.

01:46.960 --> 01:55.030
But in the end, my problem will be so when the situation of these rights are like this.

01:55.630 --> 01:56.980
All these rights.

01:58.260 --> 01:59.950
On the right.

02:00.270 --> 02:02.370
And of course, there won't be any road.

02:03.260 --> 02:07.260
Well, so this is the final situation, the final condition of my problem.

02:09.130 --> 02:09.370
Okay.

02:09.430 --> 02:12.760
So let's play this game for some very small number of thoughts.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.370
Initially, let me happiness.

02:25.960 --> 02:26.350
Too late.

02:26.770 --> 02:30.430
Right now, I'm just I just want to make the problem very clear.

02:30.730 --> 02:31.020
It's.

02:31.060 --> 02:31.870
I have only.

02:33.950 --> 02:35.180
Are is cool.

02:35.790 --> 02:39.000
So what's the best way to move bodies to this?

02:39.000 --> 02:43.110
To see if I please the elderly, let me give them numbers.

02:43.140 --> 02:45.620
So I will always number them according to their size.

02:45.630 --> 02:47.640
So one will be the next with this mollusk.

02:47.640 --> 02:50.070
This second will be the bigger disk.

02:50.880 --> 02:58.560
So in the first of what I can do is I can pick up the smallest disk from E and move it to the right.

02:58.560 --> 02:59.290
So what is it?

02:59.310 --> 03:05.080
Is it to see means only one thing that the disk which is on the top of it is big, then move to see.

03:05.310 --> 03:10.560
So we don't have to mention one or two over there because it will be exactly one disk on top of any

03:10.560 --> 03:10.980
of the rods.

03:12.530 --> 03:18.540
So if I move it from A to C, then the second step can be I can then move from A to B.

03:18.560 --> 03:21.230
That means after performing, you do see what happen.

03:22.260 --> 03:23.730
This thing happens.

03:24.750 --> 03:28.130
Eight now I after performing, it'll be what happens.

03:28.140 --> 03:33.030
I'm picking up this disk and I'm moving it to be right to let me pick it up and move it.

03:33.030 --> 03:37.450
To be that this is a bigger disk and a.

03:38.400 --> 03:44.600
Now let's say I'm moving at this from C to be because C goes now I cannot move.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.860
It is from B to C, is it.

03:49.070 --> 03:55.860
I cannot move a disc from B to C because this the desk could be is greater than it discourtesy.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.910
So if I'm over this from B to C, this will happen.

03:58.910 --> 04:02.690
But this is this is exactly what we don't want.

04:03.350 --> 04:07.100
A smaller desk cannot be a down of a bigger desk.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.360
So always the desk should be an ascending order.

04:11.690 --> 04:11.950
Right.

04:12.530 --> 04:16.280
And now, as we can see, we're kind of stuck over there.

04:16.280 --> 04:16.700
Right.

04:16.700 --> 04:17.460
Or what?

04:17.480 --> 04:19.190
What we can do is we can do this.

04:19.190 --> 04:21.320
Alter that insert of B to C.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.370
Let's say you do it.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.810
So this mollusk reaches there.

04:27.470 --> 04:29.300
And finally.

04:30.310 --> 04:31.660
B to c.

04:32.470 --> 04:35.290
B starts from here to there.

04:36.470 --> 04:40.530
And then the last one can meet you to E.

04:41.070 --> 04:41.410
E.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.260
It is a way for you to see.

04:44.270 --> 04:45.290
Then it will be.

04:45.290 --> 04:46.160
Then see to it.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.240
And then B to C and then you to see it.

04:48.590 --> 04:51.980
In this way, we are placing these to this for me to see.

04:51.980 --> 04:52.230
Right.

04:52.580 --> 04:56.510
But some of you might be wondering that, of course, this is a possible way.

04:57.350 --> 04:59.190
But is this the shortest to be?

04:59.990 --> 05:00.560
Nor I.

05:00.710 --> 05:07.580
So I always want the shortest way to make the disk from it and give the disk to see.

05:08.180 --> 05:09.920
So this is, of course, not the shortest way.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.330
So let's see what is the shortest way.

05:12.170 --> 05:14.480
You can, of course, pause the video and think about it yourself.

05:14.510 --> 05:16.640
I'm taking an example of to this because.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.290
It's easy to understand.

05:19.770 --> 05:21.600
You can try this for three days as well.

05:21.630 --> 05:23.930
Tree is a very nice example.

05:24.990 --> 05:25.260
Yeah.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.860
So let's find the shortest tree in the shortest we.

05:28.860 --> 05:34.140
What we can do is instead of making it seem more, let's make it to be more first aid.

05:34.140 --> 05:36.450
So it will be what happens this quarter.

05:36.930 --> 05:39.450
It is B now let's move.

05:40.850 --> 05:41.330
To see.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.200
The bigger disk is here now.

05:45.040 --> 05:49.690
And now let's move B to C, o, b to c, o.

05:49.690 --> 05:53.650
The shorter disk is on the top of C, but this is exactly what we want.

05:53.860 --> 06:00.640
We want to use B, we want to start placing the disk from A to C eight.

06:01.270 --> 06:02.200
So yeah.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.890
I hope there is no doubt here.

06:05.050 --> 06:08.350
Of course you feel free to try this for three described.

06:09.040 --> 06:13.090
Here you can see the shortest part was for three length.

06:13.510 --> 06:19.420
So in just three steps I was able to move full disk from E to see using b.

06:19.780 --> 06:20.560
Now of.

06:22.130 --> 06:23.300
You all can try.

06:23.600 --> 06:28.180
What will be the best way to move this disk from A to C using me?

06:29.240 --> 06:31.660
And now the number of desk history.

06:32.420 --> 06:33.650
I'm just leaving this to you.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.230
Maybe pause the video and try to do it yourself.

06:36.260 --> 06:37.610
You would understand the problem.

06:38.610 --> 06:42.780
And they just keep one thing in mind at just a bigger disk.

06:43.380 --> 06:46.910
If there's a bigger disk and you don't, it will be the down rate.

06:47.310 --> 06:51.360
That means there should be no bigger disk on top of any of the smaller disk.

06:52.210 --> 06:55.770
Well, yeah, we just need to keep that condition in.

06:58.310 --> 06:58.570
Now.

06:59.270 --> 07:00.380
Now, let's see.

07:00.380 --> 07:03.200
How can we use recursion to solve it?

07:04.070 --> 07:04.360
What?

07:04.670 --> 07:06.170
What does recursion always do?

07:06.410 --> 07:13.010
We've always known that recursion is nothing but rewriting a problem to solve problems and asking that,

07:13.010 --> 07:16.310
okay, to solve this problem, why don't you solve the part of it?

07:16.970 --> 07:17.960
We will make a move.

07:17.960 --> 07:18.530
And then.

07:19.670 --> 07:21.120
Do solve another part of it.

07:21.320 --> 07:30.350
Basically what we do is we will divide these and these into parts and we'll say, why don't you just

07:31.280 --> 07:32.000
solve this part?

07:32.000 --> 07:37.970
Because that will be a same problem that is moving this from our particular right one to the particular.

07:38.720 --> 07:45.050
And we will see that, okay, you solve this problem and then you solve the another problem.

07:45.050 --> 07:46.490
You solve the end of this problem.

07:46.490 --> 07:48.560
And then finally a problem with this heart rate.

07:48.730 --> 07:53.960
So let's see, how can we divide this, our finite into some problems?

07:55.030 --> 07:55.300
Well.

07:56.350 --> 08:01.930
So I'm taking this example of I would prefer 4 to 3 roads.

08:02.320 --> 08:02.950
Let's dig in.

08:04.090 --> 08:04.360
Okay.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.040
Let's say I have this example of.

08:08.900 --> 08:09.980
Three darts pool.

08:10.190 --> 08:14.570
So let's try to understand what we are, what we'll do by using recursion.

08:14.840 --> 08:15.710
We have three, right?

08:15.890 --> 08:16.160
Right.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.540
No man is equal to three.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.250
And now, you know, what does it do?

08:19.250 --> 08:22.640
So reducing means and is equal to the.

08:24.200 --> 08:29.270
So in Italy, what we will say is we look here, we have a function that will solve this and let's call

08:29.270 --> 08:32.660
it a night out of an eight.

08:33.020 --> 08:34.980
In short, what I'll call it I'll call it if.

08:35.350 --> 08:38.720
Well, the what will evolve in Italy there just got in.

08:39.730 --> 08:41.380
It is true in our case we will see that.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.560
But our when I which is f and a.

08:45.510 --> 08:47.700
Pharma B pharmacy.

08:48.150 --> 08:48.990
What will it do?

08:49.110 --> 08:51.180
What does this represent?

08:51.210 --> 08:52.950
It will represent that.

08:54.020 --> 08:54.620
Please.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.490
And risk.

08:59.730 --> 09:00.110
E.

09:01.210 --> 09:03.670
To be using.

09:04.770 --> 09:11.790
The goal here is just another concept, which is it's not a new concept, it's just really just named

09:11.790 --> 09:12.030
them.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.430
So here you can see it is ABC.

09:15.790 --> 09:16.840
Instead of ABC.

09:16.930 --> 09:19.600
Let me write it in a generic way.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.270
Write it f off and comma.

09:23.190 --> 09:23.790
Ramrod.

09:24.480 --> 09:30.330
That means from where we are picking these ends, means from where we want to descend, ought to be

09:30.330 --> 09:30.750
pegged.

09:31.350 --> 09:34.740
And that third variable will be the ox.

09:35.170 --> 09:35.460
Right?

09:35.970 --> 09:39.240
What is it is auxiliary rod, which is the helper rod.

09:39.870 --> 09:43.590
So we can call it helper helper or as well it we call it helper.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.950
Alberto So we are.

09:47.370 --> 09:49.380
But it's the same because we are using.

09:49.710 --> 09:51.140
We have to pick up the disease from me.

09:51.150 --> 09:55.230
Will you help take the help of B and we'll move them to C?

09:55.680 --> 09:57.840
And the third one is Europe.

09:59.230 --> 09:59.770
Like where?

09:59.770 --> 10:02.110
All this and this is Indian.

10:02.740 --> 10:05.590
This is my state of recursion.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.900
So this is what I want recursion to solve.

10:08.620 --> 10:11.830
So what should be my initial goal of the recursion?

10:11.860 --> 10:16.000
I just simply ask the recursion to go big three.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.740
In this case, liquidity.

10:19.510 --> 10:26.680
This is my initial call widget entry on my ecom e-commerce book Place the three desk from me you see

10:26.680 --> 10:27.400
by using me.

10:27.730 --> 10:28.660
But how will you do it?

10:29.260 --> 10:31.630
It's the most important part, right?

10:32.690 --> 10:33.680
So now just.

10:33.710 --> 10:34.720
Let's just think about it.

10:34.730 --> 10:35.240
Let me.

10:36.650 --> 10:36.890
Yeah.

10:37.880 --> 10:38.660
Just think about it.

10:38.960 --> 10:43.880
We want three days from E to be moving to C by using B eight.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.650
So what?

10:45.890 --> 10:47.000
So tell me, what?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.770
What will be the final case?

10:48.800 --> 10:52.670
Like, what should be the end step of this movement?

10:53.140 --> 10:56.780
It's a we have finally moved the end step.

10:56.930 --> 11:00.620
That means D let's think far ahead and building.

11:00.620 --> 11:01.490
What is the end?

11:01.610 --> 11:02.240
End step?

11:02.240 --> 11:03.620
Right in the end.

11:04.250 --> 11:05.210
What would be happening?

11:06.320 --> 11:07.010
Uh, let me.

11:07.610 --> 11:08.300
Actually, we are.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.390
What we are doing is we'll just reset from back, right?

11:11.750 --> 11:16.560
So this is the end condition that we want for this end condition to fulfill.

11:16.630 --> 11:21.770
What what what is the last step that that would have been performed?

11:22.060 --> 11:24.260
You can see that the last episode.

11:25.730 --> 11:26.380
Leasing.

11:27.450 --> 11:27.710
Yeah.

11:27.890 --> 11:29.870
Technically quickly and we see the.

11:30.350 --> 11:35.180
Can we say if we get this as a state that means you.

11:37.260 --> 11:38.190
It means to.

11:39.870 --> 11:40.130
Yeah.

11:40.140 --> 11:44.910
That means fuzz to disk on B and the last disk on C.

11:45.300 --> 11:51.420
Then we can complete our work by placing this one over here, two over here, and then one back over

11:51.420 --> 11:51.600
here.

11:52.590 --> 11:52.950
Right.

11:53.340 --> 11:59.760
So basically, if we are able to figure out this date, then we can figure out the final state or in

11:59.760 --> 12:01.050
short, what agencies.

12:02.290 --> 12:11.710
This is also possible that I ask the question to please, please, just please do disk on B eight instead

12:11.710 --> 12:13.710
of all the trees this to see.

12:13.720 --> 12:21.520
I'm just asking you to place the top two disk on be explicitly basically this column which is f of two

12:21.520 --> 12:21.940
comma.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.690
Vital because I want it to place only two disk.

12:26.940 --> 12:30.780
It would be right these two days from here in Italy.

12:30.780 --> 12:33.990
These two were on a great visit to be.

12:34.880 --> 12:35.180
Right.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.070
By using the.

12:38.170 --> 12:39.940
But basically what's happening.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.040
I have three days I want to play.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.130
Explained it Autodesk to B by using C.

12:45.370 --> 12:46.990
That's what I'm asking the government to do.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.720
It's what this function F will do, right?

12:50.620 --> 12:55.260
It will just take the risk based it on B using C, you don't have to worry.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.420
Weird how it is doing it.

12:56.470 --> 12:58.060
They will trace it back.

12:58.240 --> 12:58.820
But this thing.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.200
I'm just thinking of doing the problem.

13:02.200 --> 13:02.480
So.

13:03.430 --> 13:05.020
Oh, yeah.

13:05.080 --> 13:08.080
I'm just taking some space at me.

13:08.380 --> 13:08.890
It is.

13:09.010 --> 13:09.400
Thanks.

13:10.630 --> 13:10.920
It.

13:16.670 --> 13:17.080
Hmm.

13:17.500 --> 13:17.860
Okay.

13:18.820 --> 13:19.200
What?

13:19.960 --> 13:20.030
Yeah.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.720
Let me just write it over here.

13:22.770 --> 13:29.170
If I were to place this two disk on B by using C from me, then what I intend to do, it'll make a move.

13:29.190 --> 13:30.480
What is a move that I'm making?

13:30.720 --> 13:32.370
I'm saying now make this move.

13:32.370 --> 13:33.390
It is easier to see.

13:34.500 --> 13:34.730
Right.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.430
And now what's the situation here?

13:38.460 --> 13:44.010
The situation is simply that this is the situation after these two steps are performed, one and two.

13:44.580 --> 13:46.320
And what will be the third step?

13:46.320 --> 13:48.060
Now, a third step is nothing.

13:48.060 --> 13:51.000
But as you can see, again, it is a sad problem.

13:51.460 --> 13:53.060
I want to place this two disk.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.620
You see Crombie using it?

13:56.690 --> 13:57.050
Right.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.140
So what will be my function over here?

14:01.490 --> 14:04.610
Leader to risk from b.

14:05.790 --> 14:08.750
You'll be using it.

14:09.590 --> 14:10.370
I hope this is clear.

14:11.330 --> 14:12.140
Let me quickly.

14:13.440 --> 14:13.650
It.

14:13.650 --> 14:15.780
Read all these three steps again and.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.710
So this is what we started with.

14:27.730 --> 14:31.720
So instead of two let me it and minus one eight because.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.150
It will work for all in.

14:34.680 --> 14:35.700
But yeah.

14:35.710 --> 14:37.810
So in Lauletta we have four of these.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.430
So anything close to four.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.440
Now what I want is initially I want.

14:41.950 --> 14:42.150
Yeah.

14:46.640 --> 14:53.420
But in initially what I want is I want f off and pharma e comma e comma.

14:53.580 --> 14:54.600
Steve is.

14:55.910 --> 15:02.830
From all this forward, put it to a C by using B ain't how we will do it.

15:02.840 --> 15:07.400
We don't have to worry about rate and how we wanted to do it.

15:07.400 --> 15:12.470
Is this seven what to do instead of one big this city?

15:13.100 --> 15:13.400
Right.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.710
Place it from me.

15:16.940 --> 15:19.650
To be by using C.

15:20.030 --> 15:22.070
So somehow is and this is a problem.

15:22.070 --> 15:31.940
This is a thing that let's say if I don't have the food, this is under this as a problem that instead

15:31.940 --> 15:38.060
of now moving this tree this to C I want these three days to move to be right it's just there that helpers

15:38.060 --> 15:38.480
changed.

15:38.760 --> 15:43.460
So if I would have wanted it to shift to C, I won't be to be helping it.

15:43.880 --> 15:50.090
But now I want it to be helping it because I want these three days to move to b eight.

15:51.590 --> 15:59.800
Basically initially what's happening I'm calling this which is from dignitary risk from me mover to

15:59.800 --> 16:01.210
B by using C rate.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.640
But after this function, call is over.

16:03.910 --> 16:07.510
That means I have already moved this disk to.

16:09.340 --> 16:10.300
Think that means.

16:11.280 --> 16:16.260
I'm calling the diggers and I'm saying solve this problem for the discussion called and function.

16:16.500 --> 16:21.930
And of course, that will only work according to the to the regulation that we have today.

16:22.560 --> 16:27.510
Basically, this is the first step that's happening after the function.

16:28.170 --> 16:28.450
Yeah.

16:29.010 --> 16:33.160
Now, now we'll just assume that this is the current state.

16:33.180 --> 16:37.620
When I read your step to this is the current state of my solution.

16:38.340 --> 16:42.420
When I reset step two, this is the current state of my solution of what is disturbed.

16:42.420 --> 16:42.990
And I'm doing.

16:43.290 --> 16:48.870
I'm just moving it to see that means I'm taking the bigger one, moving it to me.

16:49.230 --> 16:50.320
That's what it means.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.470
And now what is the third step that I'm doing?

16:52.980 --> 16:53.730
I'm seeing.

16:54.730 --> 16:54.860
That.

16:54.940 --> 16:55.280
Okay.

16:55.300 --> 16:59.920
Now again, we had n minus and minus one.

17:01.050 --> 17:04.380
He had this and minus one disk on B, right.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.600
So from B moved on.

17:06.600 --> 17:09.420
And my point is to see by using it.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.100
Isn't this a sub problem?

17:11.850 --> 17:13.170
Okay, so this is a sub problem.

17:13.800 --> 17:19.800
Look, we somehow moved it in minus one disk, you see, by using it.

17:19.980 --> 17:22.650
And when all of these will be more than what will happen.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.400
We'll get a final.

17:26.050 --> 17:31.390
Some of you might be might be wondering, because, of course, it's a it's not a live lecture.

17:31.390 --> 17:32.440
It's an online record.

17:34.140 --> 17:41.040
You might be also wondering that how will these three move to this particular sea ride?

17:41.440 --> 17:43.810
So let me give you a quick example.

17:44.360 --> 17:44.590
Eight.

17:45.450 --> 17:47.220
But this is what the occasion is about.

17:47.520 --> 17:54.870
And believe me or not, this is one of the most famous and most tricky and most.

17:56.030 --> 17:59.400
Challenging problem that I've seen in The Guardian and it.

17:59.820 --> 18:00.020
Yeah.

18:00.620 --> 18:03.230
So, yeah, some of you might be wondering that.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.180
Okay, let's talk about the first step.

18:05.180 --> 18:07.850
Only let's not talk about the second step.

18:08.240 --> 18:08.450
Right.

18:10.310 --> 18:12.830
And what I'll do is I'll just these the function calls.

18:13.890 --> 18:14.190
Well.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.460
So this is.

18:17.090 --> 18:18.920
And right now, I'm just digging through your desk.

18:19.230 --> 18:20.720
Well, what will happen?

18:20.720 --> 18:21.170
Are you.

18:23.980 --> 18:24.850
Initially what will happen?

18:24.850 --> 18:34.180
I just call it f e e e e move these three from A to C by using me for what will this function called?

18:34.210 --> 18:38.500
Give me it will say F and when is when ACB which is f?

18:40.110 --> 18:42.690
You know, the from Doris.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.240
Estelle and.

18:47.290 --> 18:52.180
Move these these to be by using sorry moved is this to be.

18:53.320 --> 18:54.640
By using see they too.

18:55.390 --> 18:58.960
Don't forget this rn to help and.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.890
And from help to nature.

19:02.900 --> 19:06.260
This is what we are generally doing on this trip.

19:06.260 --> 19:08.090
ABC will call to ACB.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.800
That means somehow.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.610
Liz, stop to this from me.

19:13.880 --> 19:18.110
You see why you want me to be by using the to?

19:18.110 --> 19:18.980
Don't get confused.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.690
Well, now, let's see.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.100
This function has been called.

19:22.730 --> 19:24.170
What was the second step?

19:24.170 --> 19:25.820
And they will also third step for this.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.280
Let's just read what will be costly.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.250
This function will be called because we are calling the regression to solve it.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.430
Now what will this do ACB do?

19:34.250 --> 19:41.260
What will this do is if we do a bit issue, we will again call it f off because you know, it is recursion,

19:41.260 --> 19:41.490
right?

19:41.720 --> 19:43.400
So end is calling and minus one.

19:43.970 --> 19:46.130
Similarly, this to ACB.

19:46.880 --> 19:50.120
Now, this is a new state and this state will call one.

19:51.260 --> 19:53.420
Late word was this from a.

19:55.670 --> 19:56.060
Move.

19:56.060 --> 19:59.900
Those are two days to be by using C, right.

20:00.050 --> 20:03.050
So now what will what will be the new stadium?

20:04.070 --> 20:06.530
Move one desk from here.

20:08.180 --> 20:08.660
Do.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.800
You will see by using B.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.430
So let me quickly try to do it as well.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.890
NW to.

20:19.940 --> 20:22.640
Uh, help and.

20:26.520 --> 20:27.410
It is very tricky.

20:27.420 --> 20:27.690
Yeah.

20:28.050 --> 20:34.200
From help to this calls and minus one.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.270
From help to so calls from.

20:40.430 --> 20:47.350
To help the new the new help, but is the one advice we are going to need.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.860
So which is this one ABC they.

20:50.270 --> 20:57.050
So what will this call it will call F of zero from E to C by using me.

20:57.050 --> 21:00.630
But we can't place zero this rate, so it will come back.

21:00.650 --> 21:01.580
Now what will happen?

21:01.580 --> 21:04.190
Now this second step will be performed for.

21:05.190 --> 21:07.680
This state, which is f.

21:08.710 --> 21:09.000
Yeah.

21:09.010 --> 21:10.120
Which is nothing but.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.970
Move one desk from here.

21:13.970 --> 21:18.950
You can see it to see what here I read and you do see red but it is what it is.

21:18.950 --> 21:26.660
Ah from help button to right but don't get confused by ABC and from helper to aid because they are kind

21:26.660 --> 21:30.110
of of same things for a same state.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.000
But ABC's will change.

21:32.000 --> 21:38.220
Sometimes it will become from sometimes it will become helper and sometimes it will become Durant eight.

21:38.600 --> 21:47.300
But don't get confused in this will you know what will happen from one e using be put it on C but what

21:47.300 --> 21:48.800
it will do is it will.

21:50.250 --> 21:57.600
It will just imagine one has been put on the road and now what it will do is it will just move it to

21:57.600 --> 22:00.350
be made to the second or it will come here.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.160
That means the first right is over here.

22:02.730 --> 22:08.670
I hope we are getting the whole portion of it or what we can do is we can also, you know, it is being

22:08.670 --> 22:14.880
ready now for me to make you realize the whole discussion right now with here.

22:15.090 --> 22:18.630
But what I can do is I can call it and then in the court only we can trace it.

22:19.440 --> 22:23.310
What are the functions that are being called and what is a movement that is being made?

22:24.030 --> 22:25.860
And that will be very helpful.

22:25.860 --> 22:26.610
Helpful for me.

22:27.210 --> 22:29.270
Well, this was the first step, right?

22:29.610 --> 22:33.390
And A, B, C, but if I want to generalize it, how can I generalize it?

22:33.690 --> 22:36.180
I will simply say F and.

22:37.510 --> 22:39.110
From Helper.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.230
Do we want to move this?

22:41.530 --> 22:42.280
Why do you do?

22:42.490 --> 22:45.460
You firstly move and minus one from here.

22:45.460 --> 22:51.560
Only using where I want to go to the help of the helper road.

22:52.180 --> 22:57.760
So if this happens, then in the second step you perform this, which is from you.

22:58.210 --> 23:04.000
That means that because we have moved and minus one disk that that means there's only one this left

23:04.000 --> 23:05.430
on the from God.

23:05.740 --> 23:07.420
I'm moving this one.

23:07.430 --> 23:09.040
This from from not to to it.

23:09.370 --> 23:16.910
Now what the third step we had this end minus one doesn't mean is when I kept in waiting on the helper.

23:16.910 --> 23:17.380
Not right.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.130
So pick them from the helper.

23:19.150 --> 23:24.400
I'd use the current surrendered which is different door and okay and minus one.

23:24.970 --> 23:25.210
Yeah.

23:25.900 --> 23:31.450
Big them from the helper use the corridor which is now empty because you know we have made this move

23:31.450 --> 23:34.000
which is after the and of.

23:35.030 --> 23:35.300
Yeah.

23:36.350 --> 23:37.610
Big dent from the health budget.

23:37.910 --> 23:42.680
It was the current drawbridges from and move them to the road.

23:43.190 --> 23:48.470
This is a normal regulation that will coordinate in the next video will just squirted and see.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.870
I will just bring don't bring down some value.

23:50.870 --> 23:53.540
Then the output will go.

23:53.540 --> 23:53.720
Yeah.

23:53.780 --> 23:54.170
Thank you.
