00:00.960 --> 00:01.620
Hello, everyone.

00:02.250 --> 00:03.090
It's me.

00:03.150 --> 00:05.880
This problem is I have every problem.

00:06.750 --> 00:07.680
Old enemy poker.

00:08.040 --> 00:12.420
Because when I was, like, three or four years ago, when I was.

00:13.250 --> 00:14.960
But mean this was the first problem.

00:15.970 --> 00:20.200
And actually left me programming because I was not able to understand it.

00:21.810 --> 00:24.660
Because I was totally jumping on the solution and there was no one.

00:27.220 --> 00:29.230
So let's see how to solve this problem.

00:29.320 --> 00:33.670
And this will give you an example.

00:34.010 --> 00:36.610
How to solve all these strings problem.

00:37.120 --> 00:42.280
How to think of a way in solving problems of digit with strings and.

00:43.330 --> 00:47.170
A very nice problem because after this, we'll be doing some very interesting string problem.

00:47.170 --> 00:53.060
And those are very famous problems as well by wild card matching and other parametric idea.

00:53.950 --> 00:56.620
So we will have a mentality.

00:56.620 --> 01:00.730
We'll just have a thinking that will help us on this.

01:01.180 --> 01:06.510
And after this, that same mentality will help us solve the other problems as well.

01:07.210 --> 01:10.990
So the problem is the problem's name is at a distance.

01:11.590 --> 01:13.450
You understand why it is called at a distance.

01:14.660 --> 01:17.120
You are given two strings, A and B answer.

01:17.810 --> 01:18.310
What is this?

01:18.610 --> 01:21.530
This number of operations, you need to transform it to be.

01:22.890 --> 01:25.200
Great water operations operation.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.320
First operation is to date one letter from one of the.

01:29.370 --> 01:31.630
It can insert one letter into one of the strings.

01:31.650 --> 01:35.010
Replace one letter from one of the strings with another letter.

01:36.300 --> 01:36.690
Input.

01:36.690 --> 01:38.160
Okay, let's leave input output.

01:38.550 --> 01:44.090
This this is a first excuse, which is food and money and the output is four, right?

01:44.490 --> 01:46.290
That means I have two things.

01:47.470 --> 01:54.760
Afterwards, things like the food and money in that case and I have to convert would lose money by performing

01:54.760 --> 02:01.480
these operations to any one of the characters to not to any one of the characters.

02:01.570 --> 02:04.000
I mean, one operation to one character equals to one.

02:04.780 --> 02:07.320
But I have to find out how many operations I have to play.

02:07.330 --> 02:13.480
So as the output suggests, it's for let's let's let's figure out what how it is for.

02:13.780 --> 02:17.260
And then we'll you will be able to understand what the problem is.

02:18.220 --> 02:20.770
The operations are the lead one letter from one of the strings.

02:21.190 --> 02:23.050
Well, here, one of the strings.

02:23.170 --> 02:27.220
This part is slightly confusing, because now it says that you can.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.100
You have, you can do these operations in both districts eight.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.690
But just a quick hint or maybe a quick.

02:37.970 --> 02:39.980
Thing to keep in mind is that.

02:41.140 --> 02:42.910
It was not one of those things.

02:42.940 --> 02:48.820
If it says that, okay, do the operation in only the above string or only the downstream?

02:49.150 --> 02:51.040
And then also the answer would have been same.

02:51.250 --> 02:53.080
We'll see how that.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.350
Evaluate to.

02:55.810 --> 03:01.570
But before before moving on to that part, let's just keep this in mind that we can do it in one of

03:01.570 --> 03:02.060
District eight.

03:03.460 --> 03:03.810
Okay.

03:03.820 --> 03:05.650
So how is the answer for it?

03:06.010 --> 03:11.050
Mostly what I can do is I can convert this f to am I can replace perform a replace operation on this

03:11.050 --> 03:18.970
f are you get them to images m or images or and now this or D and E via right.

03:19.210 --> 03:22.210
Let's replace this or when let's replace this.

03:22.210 --> 03:27.340
Do you by e basically perform three operations right now and finally insert way.

03:28.340 --> 03:28.530
Eight.

03:28.780 --> 03:33.580
So I have three replace operations and one insert operations, which gives me what?

03:34.450 --> 03:36.170
But this is a very easy example.

03:36.180 --> 03:42.740
This is a very simple, easy Boolean example that we are iterating and we are not able to figure out.

03:44.670 --> 03:46.850
Basically, if they're not equal, then do this.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.390
Otherwise, if they're equal, do this.

03:49.170 --> 03:52.320
Just think of a case where this was not here.

03:52.380 --> 03:53.580
Let's do this over there.

03:54.620 --> 03:55.010
When?

03:55.990 --> 03:58.450
Then what would have been the good solution?

03:59.110 --> 03:59.980
Just think about this.

03:59.980 --> 04:01.900
And right now we can see the land of this.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.340
Things are equal reality.

04:03.610 --> 04:04.900
This was the above string.

04:05.110 --> 04:05.890
It said this.

04:07.270 --> 04:10.140
Late in this order.

04:10.150 --> 04:13.480
We cannot, you know, just iterate over and keep on replacing.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.760
Let me give you an example.

04:14.770 --> 04:15.310
Let's see.

04:16.480 --> 04:16.720
Yeah.

04:17.350 --> 04:19.180
This was the shrink money.

04:20.220 --> 04:21.090
And here it is.

04:22.040 --> 04:22.180
Act.

04:23.230 --> 04:30.420
So now can we perform the gritty approach that if they're not equal, replace it, not equal, replace

04:30.420 --> 04:31.970
it, not equal, replace it?

04:31.980 --> 04:34.830
No, I can't do that because I haven't had that operation going delete.

04:35.430 --> 04:39.630
I can delete these two weeks and then I can simply get this many.

04:41.300 --> 04:41.540
Eight.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.870
Well, let's keep these things in mind.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.460
If there are multiple possibilities and greedy approaches won't work.

04:47.480 --> 04:51.950
Of course I can list on many really approaches and show you that all of them will not work.

04:52.090 --> 04:58.820
But I would just leave that to you now to think about the approaches and see whether or not working.

04:59.610 --> 05:00.530
Let's get back to.

05:02.560 --> 05:07.870
Now in every dynamic programming problem, what we have done is we have a recursive solution.

05:08.260 --> 05:14.620
And before moving on to the solution, we have some states defined right in this kind of programming.

05:14.620 --> 05:16.390
What in this deep one strings.

05:16.390 --> 05:18.670
What I'll do is I'll just keep.

05:20.340 --> 05:20.930
Iterating.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.160
I'll just keep two pointers.

05:23.250 --> 05:27.330
I ended initially there on the first indexes of Buddhist strings.

05:27.540 --> 05:30.210
Basically the zeroth index of both the strings.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.080
And I'll see.

05:32.140 --> 05:32.980
Let me write it.

05:33.550 --> 05:37.030
It f i comedy the present.

05:38.010 --> 05:38.360
The.

05:39.500 --> 05:39.980
The answer.

05:39.980 --> 05:42.380
Basically, that is the minimum number.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.400
A minimum number of operations.

05:47.350 --> 05:47.860
So that.

05:49.910 --> 05:51.730
It would still be.

05:52.660 --> 05:58.600
Just simply because Friday represents the onset so that it can still be right.

05:58.720 --> 06:03.900
So in this part, what is A and B here hit in B C's?

06:04.630 --> 06:06.310
Because, you know, we have I in there.

06:06.310 --> 06:07.210
We have some variables.

06:07.540 --> 06:10.960
They see from 8 billion, that is.

06:13.670 --> 06:16.080
If I in and.

06:17.140 --> 06:20.080
It converged to be of little.

06:20.950 --> 06:22.270
And this is important.

06:22.460 --> 06:25.300
So this is what we have already been doing, always been doing.

06:25.630 --> 06:32.590
When we talk about the index and the we talk about the first eight or the last eight because it depends

06:32.590 --> 06:36.400
on the bottom up approach or top down approach that you are trying to solve it.

06:36.910 --> 06:40.210
Now, here we see that I'm just converting this.

06:41.370 --> 06:44.100
Particular substring of v which is from i2 end.

06:45.470 --> 06:49.070
It would be too from me to adhere to it and just give me the best lines.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.100
No, not this.

06:51.680 --> 06:51.860
No.

06:51.860 --> 06:53.980
Let's keep this thing in mind and let's move.

06:53.990 --> 06:55.010
Let's move ahead.

06:55.430 --> 06:55.730
It's.

06:56.210 --> 06:57.530
Yeah, it's more it.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.570
By keeping this thing in mind.

07:01.340 --> 07:12.520
You guys, if I say if this is I and this is the the first indexes I hear g here won't F of 00b are

07:12.520 --> 07:13.330
final answer.

07:15.060 --> 07:15.720
Final answer.

07:16.350 --> 07:17.410
It should be a final answer.

07:17.410 --> 07:17.620
Right?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.370
Because what does that zero represents?

07:20.380 --> 07:22.710
That is starting from zero.

07:22.710 --> 07:29.640
Thailand will be converted to be starting from zero two and that is that are both the complete acing

07:29.640 --> 07:31.500
and the complete B string, right.

07:31.980 --> 07:32.490
No.

07:33.430 --> 07:35.410
Let's perform these operations one by one.

07:39.340 --> 07:46.930
So let's say I'm on the first operation all delete rate and this is the important part it's a I'm performing

07:46.930 --> 07:49.300
a delete operation if first operation.

07:51.650 --> 07:56.980
But tell me we PIRG that means right now on the Iot.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.570
X and digital index.

07:59.570 --> 08:07.700
On the more string side here you can see I enjoyed initially zero zero, but that's not always the case.

08:07.880 --> 08:08.760
I will move forward.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.920
They will move forward and they will apparently.

08:11.150 --> 08:12.770
Let's talk about the first case only.

08:13.730 --> 08:16.070
If I'm performing a delete operation here.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.170
In the first letter.

08:18.170 --> 08:21.410
I'm trying to delete this particular character.

08:21.620 --> 08:22.830
F eight.

08:23.210 --> 08:26.080
I'm deleting this character f l me.

08:26.540 --> 08:26.900
What?

08:27.930 --> 08:29.880
What string would be left to match.

08:30.450 --> 08:32.100
Okay, so let's say I deleted this if.

08:33.600 --> 08:38.550
Now, the next thing that I want to match from here is this.

08:42.300 --> 08:42.540
Right.

08:42.930 --> 08:45.990
And the next thing that I want to match from B.

08:46.800 --> 08:47.070
B.

08:47.550 --> 08:51.720
It is still money because I deleted the first corrected off.

08:52.410 --> 08:56.160
If E string, I'm just deleted f and I'm not deleted.

08:56.640 --> 09:03.000
That means if I still have to match, if I still have to, you know, edit in a two string B and perform

09:03.000 --> 09:03.630
the operation.

09:03.930 --> 09:10.920
That means this whole string is still left here and this whole string is still left in because by deleting

09:10.920 --> 09:13.620
a character, the characters did not match.

09:14.460 --> 09:16.950
Because I'm just perform a simple, plain delete operation.

09:17.960 --> 09:18.870
You can see.

09:20.000 --> 09:20.360
Just.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.870
Yeah, this and this.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.920
And I see it here at EPG.

09:27.260 --> 09:32.750
If I'm deleting the character f it will be equal to dip I plus one.

09:33.860 --> 09:40.070
For Majid, that means tell me, what is the distance between order and money?

09:41.450 --> 09:42.510
Because I have deleted if.

09:43.290 --> 09:43.570
Eight.

09:45.380 --> 09:46.070
Audie.

09:46.160 --> 09:52.370
Basically, I won't I will move ahead because now this of stingers left in Dubai and I will stay there

09:52.370 --> 09:59.660
because there is no such thing, because there is no deletion, no character matching in the OR.

10:00.230 --> 10:05.920
I just perform one operation that is dilutive and this plus one because I performed in Operation eight.

10:06.200 --> 10:11.060
So always remember the plus one will be there because I performed in operation and that's what I need

10:11.060 --> 10:11.960
to return in the end.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.360
Now let's go back.

10:20.790 --> 10:21.630
Now we're back.

10:21.630 --> 10:24.700
And now let's delete em.

10:25.820 --> 10:25.950
Okay.

10:26.120 --> 10:26.990
Let's delete them.

10:28.280 --> 10:29.810
What will I get if you delete them?

10:29.990 --> 10:34.310
I still need to match food because I deleted them and I still need to match.

10:35.030 --> 10:35.750
Or anyway.

10:36.720 --> 10:36.950
Eight.

10:37.590 --> 10:39.000
So in this case.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.860
If I delete them later, deleted them.

10:41.870 --> 10:42.920
This is the second case.

10:43.190 --> 10:45.490
Let me make it right.

10:45.680 --> 10:46.130
Accepted.

10:47.330 --> 10:49.400
But in this case, what is the easy?

10:49.460 --> 10:51.140
Because now this is another operation.

10:51.530 --> 10:53.210
In this case, DPA becomes.

10:55.920 --> 10:56.930
It becomes deep.

10:56.930 --> 10:58.230
DP i.e. bless.

10:59.490 --> 10:59.800
Okay.

10:59.880 --> 11:04.200
This time we won't add anything, you know, because I did not move forward and I still have that whole

11:05.250 --> 11:07.440
string food to be managed with.

11:08.560 --> 11:08.780
Oh.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.570
Anyway, now this game is going.

11:11.020 --> 11:12.580
Basically, it will be a comedy.

11:12.580 --> 11:14.860
Plus one plus one.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.770
I hope you got this point.

11:20.060 --> 11:21.770
We have two relations.

11:21.780 --> 11:24.770
First, if I dilutive and the second if I delete.

11:25.130 --> 11:25.410
And.

11:26.350 --> 11:28.570
Because I always have two choices, right?

11:28.810 --> 11:34.690
If I you are not the end means they are not binding on the end of the string or they are not pointing

11:34.690 --> 11:36.040
to an empty substring.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.710
That means they are always pointing to some characters.

11:38.710 --> 11:41.730
And on those characters I can always performed a delete of.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.960
ET Now if I insert, let's talk about insert.

11:47.170 --> 11:48.760
It may remove its.

11:50.790 --> 11:53.170
Again coming back to the same place.

11:53.310 --> 12:00.240
If I'm if I was on f days on them and I'm performing an insert operation, it's in performing an insert

12:00.240 --> 12:04.200
operation in string E at place of 88.

12:05.080 --> 12:11.430
And if I'm inserting something, I will always try to match the down character, the character in the

12:11.430 --> 12:12.510
other string, basically.

12:13.500 --> 12:21.100
If I'm inserting somewhere, if I'm inserting a character in front of food, which is everybody, I

12:21.240 --> 12:22.320
want to insert something here.

12:22.620 --> 12:26.970
And I will always start to insert a character which is down here because I want them to match.

12:27.900 --> 12:29.310
Then only the pointer will move ahead.

12:29.310 --> 12:30.140
Because they have meshed.

12:30.630 --> 12:30.900
They.

12:31.950 --> 12:35.370
Basically it will be m letter inserted.

12:35.370 --> 12:39.030
M That means this m matches this m.

12:40.200 --> 12:40.460
Right.

12:40.830 --> 12:45.240
In this case, what happens if these two images now, what is left to match?

12:46.020 --> 12:49.810
I want to match this or any way to f40.

12:51.150 --> 12:53.290
Because I've already inserted em.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.170
This is what an insert operation does.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.300
So in this case, what will be my state?

12:58.080 --> 12:58.710
Think about it.

12:59.230 --> 13:00.030
Goodbye, David.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.650
Did I move forwards?

13:02.670 --> 13:04.170
Of course I've inserted em.

13:04.560 --> 13:10.680
Inserting em just means that I'm trying to match the below character with the operation that I perform.

13:10.950 --> 13:17.400
I'm not actually inserting it into the string in my, you know, but it's an imaginary inserting because

13:17.400 --> 13:18.570
I'm performing an operation.

13:19.380 --> 13:21.900
I inserted em which matches the below em.

13:21.930 --> 13:24.660
Now I did not move forward because I will still be on F.

13:24.870 --> 13:28.560
I mean, the whole food thing is still there to be measured.

13:29.860 --> 13:30.730
I did not move ahead.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.170
I will remain as it is.

13:33.190 --> 13:39.700
They will move ahead because this m measured by an insert operation and i will perform this one.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.920
I led one because I inserted something.

13:42.700 --> 13:43.750
I hope this is very clear.

13:44.200 --> 13:44.410
Eight.

13:45.040 --> 13:49.720
Now let's think about inserting something below means in the lower string.

13:51.380 --> 13:51.740
Yep.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.530
Now, let's m inserting f here.

13:55.720 --> 13:56.470
In front of him.

13:56.620 --> 14:01.720
I look in his LG was pointing it, but JJ inserted something and this particular location.

14:01.990 --> 14:04.210
I still have this whole string to match.

14:04.210 --> 14:04.510
Right.

14:05.580 --> 14:07.740
AMD did not match any correctable rate.

14:08.100 --> 14:13.290
The only insertion that took place is F which matched this f which was above in the.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.540
Doing it right now.

14:17.570 --> 14:23.060
Those things which are remaining there needs to be managed at this or D and the whole money.

14:24.590 --> 14:25.490
The whole money rate.

14:25.940 --> 14:27.160
Only the EFCC had acted.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.250
The above sting meshed.

14:28.760 --> 14:32.090
So in this case, what will happen is simple.

14:32.240 --> 14:35.090
DPD will be called to a P.

14:37.960 --> 14:46.010
I bless one for Margie plus one my plus one year because F.M. during insertion.

14:46.470 --> 14:49.690
Well here there's one thing to note and that is.

14:52.640 --> 14:52.930
That.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.620
EPA, is it this is equal to this.

14:58.520 --> 14:58.710
Right.

14:58.940 --> 15:03.950
Because if I'm deleting and if that means no match or D with money.

15:05.070 --> 15:05.350
Right.

15:05.910 --> 15:13.110
Or if I'm inserting F in the listing, it also means the same thing that match or D with my name because

15:13.110 --> 15:14.610
this F has already been missed.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.180
Edit Imagine if all you delete in there.

15:18.060 --> 15:25.170
Eight, and both of them will lead us to this same direction, because if we have this mess, it's out

15:25.170 --> 15:25.800
of attention.

15:26.220 --> 15:30.840
Or if it's delayed, it's again out of our hands and we don't have to meet it.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.950
We don't have to edit it.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.400
Something I hope you got this.

15:34.410 --> 15:36.050
That both of them are the same approach.

15:38.000 --> 15:38.720
No.

15:39.080 --> 15:39.380
Yeah.

15:39.590 --> 15:40.520
It's move ahead.

15:42.860 --> 15:46.940
When it comes to the third operation and the third operation is in place.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.970
So, again, if easier.

15:50.510 --> 15:50.960
Easier.

15:51.230 --> 15:52.700
And I want to replace this if.

15:53.970 --> 15:55.470
With what character should replace.

15:55.620 --> 16:01.260
Of course, replacing a with some character except him doesn't make sense, right?

16:01.590 --> 16:02.460
Because we are matching.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.560
We want minimum possible operation.

16:05.710 --> 16:07.260
We will match.

16:08.350 --> 16:08.710
This.

16:08.710 --> 16:12.280
If it doesn't, they will try to replace everything.

16:12.580 --> 16:15.190
And so let's say he replaced this f with them.

16:15.970 --> 16:16.780
Now what?

16:16.780 --> 16:19.810
All strings are there which needs matching?

16:21.450 --> 16:23.460
This needs matching with.

16:24.290 --> 16:24.650
This.

16:24.650 --> 16:31.430
That means from A-plus one to end needs matching with J plus 128.

16:31.760 --> 16:39.990
So what it becomes known DP icon mid-year is equals to DP I plus one on my plus one because I enjoy

16:40.010 --> 16:43.970
bottom edge because I replace the character with the second character.

16:44.650 --> 16:44.860
Right.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.060
And.

16:48.470 --> 16:52.910
Next is if I am performing the same operation in the other string.

16:53.360 --> 16:59.210
As I said, guys, other string actually is it's just a, you know, something to confuse otherwise.

16:59.630 --> 17:01.730
But we can see that we'll have all those states.

17:02.030 --> 17:02.260
Okay.

17:02.270 --> 17:02.930
We'll see that little.

17:03.890 --> 17:10.040
Now just think about if I am replacing this MF one performing replace operation on this great character

17:10.460 --> 17:11.260
instead of fired.

17:11.480 --> 17:19.850
If I am replacing this and if and again this is left to match with this one, it becomes BPI is again

17:19.850 --> 17:26.420
equal to BPI plus one plus one plus one because these are going to end performing some operations.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.340
I hope this makes sense.

17:28.850 --> 17:29.140
Eight.

17:30.420 --> 17:34.770
So these are all cases that we have done on, let's say, litigation.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.640
Just, you know, quick introspection.

17:39.730 --> 17:44.660
Let's see if we don't have to perform operation in this second string.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.110
Let's do a new operation performing the second string.

17:47.860 --> 17:52.720
Because there are circumstances that you can only perform the operation in the first string.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.070
And what world stage do I have?

17:54.400 --> 17:56.890
I have divided custody by plus one, g plus one.

17:57.460 --> 18:00.730
EBITDA goes to Dubai for my G plus one plus one.

18:00.850 --> 18:02.530
Nobody goes to Dubai plus one de.

18:02.530 --> 18:03.150
Plus en plus one.

18:04.290 --> 18:04.590
Eight.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.070
I hope this makes sense.

18:07.100 --> 18:14.120
We have all three states and here also we have the same three states which are repeating in both cases,

18:15.290 --> 18:15.980
things will be same.

18:17.630 --> 18:22.910
I hope I hope this is making sense, either with the lead in Sirte or the place in one of the strings

18:22.910 --> 18:29.330
equal to the leader place in insert in the other string and is also equal to the lead instead of raising

18:29.330 --> 18:29.720
both the.

18:30.660 --> 18:34.640
Well, because we have all these same states operating and we have to calculate for those two.

18:35.900 --> 18:38.910
Right now, there's also a fourth state.

18:39.450 --> 18:40.440
What is the fourth state?

18:41.890 --> 18:42.640
The First Lady's.

18:42.640 --> 18:43.180
Let's see.

18:43.830 --> 18:44.250
Let's see.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.040
I was there.

18:46.060 --> 18:50.200
Jay was here initially and I replaced Jeff with them.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.540
Now use Isaiah, Jay-Z.

18:53.640 --> 18:53.970
Eight.

18:54.800 --> 19:01.520
Either day there because we moved I plus one G plus when I tell me if what the characters are saying

19:01.940 --> 19:03.230
is that any operation needed.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.350
Part of the photo operation.

19:05.590 --> 19:07.150
What operation is no operation?

19:08.500 --> 19:17.440
If both the characters are same, that means if each of I is equal to be your G, that means don't perform

19:17.440 --> 19:18.150
an operation.

19:18.160 --> 19:21.010
But in this case, what is my deep, deepest nothing?

19:21.010 --> 19:22.750
VBIED is nothing.

19:22.940 --> 19:24.190
See, these are already eyes.

19:24.190 --> 19:26.830
Right now what is left to match is this and this.

19:27.160 --> 19:31.960
That means deep ideas equals to deep I plus one g plus one.

19:32.170 --> 19:35.350
And this was not an operations will not at plus one after it.

19:36.360 --> 19:36.630
Eight.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.220
I hope you got this point.

19:39.670 --> 19:42.610
There will be a case when both the characters are already merged.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.240
I enjoy.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.740
Which doesn't need any more matching.

19:46.100 --> 19:50.540
If they don't need matching, we won't perform an operation that is equal to DPA plus one G plus.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.270
Well, now these are the four operations and now just some basic cases that we need to think about.

19:58.450 --> 19:59.800
And those are not very easy.

20:00.100 --> 20:03.400
Let's say I reach out and that means easier.

20:04.450 --> 20:06.460
And there is.

20:09.370 --> 20:14.650
Quite possible late because some sometimes AI is increasing, sometimes it is increasing something sometimes

20:14.650 --> 20:15.390
more than increasing.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.780
We are doing all possible ways.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.790
We are writing about all possible cases.

20:18.790 --> 20:21.290
I you will be in okay.

20:22.210 --> 20:26.110
Before going to the student, let's talk about if what I enjoy are on the end.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.940
It's it is near and dear east here.

20:28.980 --> 20:30.060
What does it represent?

20:30.420 --> 20:34.260
It represents match empty string with empty string.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.740
So what does it mean if I.

20:37.890 --> 20:40.200
Is it not size?

20:40.740 --> 20:43.500
And here is the word.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.050
That means water on the end.

20:46.350 --> 20:47.080
Water Indian.

20:47.130 --> 20:48.630
That means I simply.

20:49.630 --> 20:53.500
How many operations are required to convert an empty string to an interesting zero?

20:54.680 --> 20:57.290
Right in 0 seconds.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.750
Let's ice equals to Edwardses.

21:00.750 --> 21:01.260
That means.

21:02.350 --> 21:03.270
Eyes on the end.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.570
And Jay's not on the end.

21:06.200 --> 21:06.490
They.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.130
Let's say, geez, over here anyway.

21:11.140 --> 21:11.680
It doesn't matter.

21:11.830 --> 21:12.100
Right.

21:12.190 --> 21:12.820
Wherever it is.

21:13.450 --> 21:20.470
If I want to convert an empty string to this and even I model operations going to perform, I can just

21:20.470 --> 21:22.750
insert an insert e insert.

21:22.750 --> 21:29.350
By itself, it is about converting an empty string, which I use pointing to you as string which js

21:29.350 --> 21:30.490
point individual anyway.

21:31.660 --> 21:36.160
So if I is on the end, which is I is on the last character.

21:38.030 --> 21:44.060
And it's not on the last character, then what I can do is I can simply say I can simply return.

21:44.450 --> 21:45.920
It is, Bedard says.

21:47.110 --> 21:52.660
I mean, the number of characters that are left to be converted, eight minus the Can I do this?

21:55.730 --> 21:57.740
One, two, three, four, five, five.

21:57.740 --> 21:59.500
Minus two, three, eight.

21:59.990 --> 22:06.120
Well, I just counted how many characters are there from zero to end of B and assembly written there

22:06.170 --> 22:13.070
because that many insert insertion operations are required or that many deletion operations are required.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.540
You can say it both ways.

22:14.750 --> 22:22.940
We have seen this rate that deleting is equal to inserting from the other or insert in deleting in the

22:22.940 --> 22:26.240
other is equal to inserting in the other way.

22:26.300 --> 22:28.160
Both of them have the same DP.

22:29.250 --> 22:29.880
Relations.

22:30.660 --> 22:32.760
I hope this is making sense.

22:32.910 --> 22:33.590
Oh, let me.

22:33.870 --> 22:34.620
Is this.

22:37.440 --> 22:37.800
Okay.

22:39.860 --> 22:46.580
Finally, what we have is if the final case, which is if Jay-Z was to be ordered, says, let's do

22:46.580 --> 22:48.840
this, this is the end of jazz.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.850
These the N-word, I need to return him.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.870
But he's pointing, I'm dissing.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.080
He has something left.

22:54.650 --> 22:59.690
It means it is a size minus A is many operations are required.

23:00.590 --> 23:06.050
Well, and if it let's say it doesn't go in this base case, it doesn't go in this base case doesn't

23:06.050 --> 23:06.920
go in this base case.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.260
That means is greater than sorry.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.310
I is less than you.

23:10.310 --> 23:10.880
Don't say this.

23:12.300 --> 23:13.260
And list then.

23:14.290 --> 23:15.010
Viruses.

23:15.970 --> 23:16.280
Right.

23:16.330 --> 23:20.050
So if I learned that lesson, it's easy to let them be the size.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.580
That means we have characters.

23:21.730 --> 23:24.430
We have characters will perform these four operation.

23:26.120 --> 23:26.350
This.

23:27.630 --> 23:28.930
I hope you understood this.

23:28.950 --> 23:32.430
And how is this debate because of religion coming in.

23:33.060 --> 23:34.140
Finally, what we have.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.640
We have it be okay.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.090
So firstly, we have two cases.

23:41.600 --> 23:44.900
I think I need to lose it and open it again.

23:48.310 --> 23:48.500
Hmm.

23:57.450 --> 23:59.970
But finally, what we have is if.

24:02.090 --> 24:08.030
If the characters are if AA is not equal to BD, that means what?

24:08.030 --> 24:09.110
The characters are different.

24:09.140 --> 24:17.900
That means API will be equal to nothing but minimum of all the operations that I can do a minimum of.

24:18.650 --> 24:21.980
It's covered all the operations, but operation is deep.

24:22.010 --> 24:25.100
I won't mind a plus one.

24:26.460 --> 24:26.970
Okay.

24:29.080 --> 24:34.690
Accumulated is equal to a minimum of bust operation that I'm doing, which is deep.

24:35.110 --> 24:36.340
I got my G plus one.

24:39.050 --> 24:41.040
Plus one former DP.

24:41.480 --> 24:47.870
I got my A-plus one from AJ plus one, which is in session in the first grade and deletion in the second

24:47.870 --> 24:48.110
case.

24:48.350 --> 24:53.600
And the third one is I plus one comma G plus one plus one.

24:54.680 --> 24:55.990
Eight other ways.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.580
Else that means what the characters are saying.

24:58.580 --> 25:04.790
Then it is nothing, but it is nothing but equal to a p i plus one comma g plus.

25:05.470 --> 25:10.760
But I had no plus one added because no operation is performed.

25:11.030 --> 25:13.160
You are already getting the correct assessing.

25:14.510 --> 25:16.120
I hope this is making sense.

25:17.130 --> 25:20.130
So this is the whole code also, and we'll call it out also.

25:20.130 --> 25:21.750
But this is the important part.

25:22.170 --> 25:24.600
But what's upsetting is not to match.

25:25.660 --> 25:29.080
And we were using this same approach, the same thought process.

25:30.220 --> 25:34.810
All over the destroying problems would tank everyone in the next part.
