WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:01.040
Yeah.

00:01.080 --> 00:03.390
So let's move on to the next problem, which is grade one.

00:03.390 --> 00:11.160
And it's again, a very easy problem for all of us because it's kind of basic only there's a great with

00:11.160 --> 00:17.760
edge horizontal rolling w vertical columns and I did a the square diet rule from the top and git column

00:17.760 --> 00:18.270
from the left.

00:19.080 --> 00:24.270
What each i n attendee squared I imagine is described by a character committee.

00:24.810 --> 00:31.500
If it is a dot where it is empty, if it is a hash squared.

00:32.520 --> 00:33.840
Is a bald squib.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.890
It is every MP or it is a wild squib.

00:38.430 --> 00:41.550
It is guaranteed at square one and at the blue are empty squares.

00:41.940 --> 00:46.530
So this, starting in the last few days, are empty squares.

00:46.590 --> 00:53.910
I can't even start from square one, go one and reach each common w by repeating repeatedly, moving

00:54.300 --> 01:00.810
right or down to in a decent empty square right in the middle of Toro's box from square one one to each

01:00.810 --> 01:04.020
common w as us answer can be extremely large.

01:04.470 --> 01:05.250
Find account.

01:06.330 --> 01:07.130
Martello this.

01:07.890 --> 01:08.200
Right.

01:08.970 --> 01:10.420
So it still doesn't exist.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.030
Housing.

01:11.550 --> 01:12.300
Great, great, great.

01:12.300 --> 01:14.340
So we all have done this, basically.

01:14.880 --> 01:15.190
Great.

01:15.510 --> 01:15.870
But it's.

01:17.350 --> 01:18.310
Would you understand this?

01:19.350 --> 01:20.310
Not a big deal.

01:20.310 --> 01:20.580
No.

01:25.880 --> 01:26.420
Well, let's see.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.070
I don't have any blockers or.

01:28.070 --> 01:28.640
Now, let's see.

01:28.670 --> 01:28.910
Just.

01:28.910 --> 01:29.960
I don't have any blockers.

01:31.430 --> 01:31.730
Late.

01:32.120 --> 01:36.890
And as we know, we can only move on the right or down side of it that I'm moving to.

01:36.890 --> 01:38.570
Right or I'm moving to don't.

01:39.230 --> 01:44.630
Well, let's think of this in reverse order that if I talk about.

01:47.020 --> 01:50.590
If I talk about the loss that is each common w sin.

01:51.910 --> 01:59.110
Then from where I can come to the city, I can come from the cell, which is at minus one W or I can

01:59.110 --> 02:00.640
come from this cell, which is.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.400
Command W minus one.

02:05.000 --> 02:12.740
So there are two options to come to this particular cell, which is each W minus one and H minus one

02:12.740 --> 02:13.250
common w.

02:13.850 --> 02:15.590
So what are the total number of B's?

02:19.140 --> 02:23.970
Reaching Edgecombe or W, which is as and for which Gummer W what are their total number of ways of

02:23.970 --> 02:24.480
reaching it?

02:25.290 --> 02:29.130
If I am coming from two places to different places, then I can simply see it.

02:29.190 --> 02:29.550
Okay.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.520
F of x comma ws equals to f of x comber w minus one.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.810
And then I am coming from the cell.

02:34.140 --> 02:38.930
The total number of beats from the cell plus the total number of ways from this in.

02:39.980 --> 02:41.000
Simple as that, right?

02:41.540 --> 02:47.130
And how is ever minus one being calculated again the same reconciliation, which is being fun.

02:47.660 --> 02:47.920
Right.

02:48.650 --> 02:49.790
But now let's talk about.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.970
Sell one comma one, this one.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.600
Okay, so what are the number of ways in which I'm coming to the sale?

02:57.260 --> 03:00.650
It's fine by me because I'm starting from the same age.

03:00.650 --> 03:02.660
So there's only one way in which I'm going to this.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.250
Always.

03:05.150 --> 03:06.410
It shouldn't be a big deal now.

03:07.490 --> 03:09.530
Let me quickly fill this table.

03:10.430 --> 03:15.270
And yes, of course, there are some starting blockers in this room will handle them later.

03:15.290 --> 03:16.520
First of all, let's understand this.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.820
The number of is one.

03:18.830 --> 03:21.140
Again, it will be one in this case by because.

03:22.330 --> 03:23.440
Through this sale, which is.

03:24.010 --> 03:25.960
Let me extend.

03:27.740 --> 03:30.350
The same one commando raid.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.990
I can only come from cell one, comma one.

03:33.320 --> 03:37.970
So the number of ways of reaching one common one should be equal to the more obvious of reaching one

03:37.970 --> 03:38.450
comma two.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.350
Similarly, this.

03:39.350 --> 03:39.650
This.

03:39.650 --> 03:40.040
This.

03:40.040 --> 03:40.640
And this.

03:40.670 --> 03:41.480
This is.

03:42.580 --> 03:47.320
What are the number of ways of reaching to commit to it is as it I can come from this or I can come

03:47.320 --> 03:53.920
from this or I'll add them, I'll get to then I let them I get three, four, five, simply I'll get

03:54.250 --> 03:54.490
one.

03:54.490 --> 03:58.450
Plus two is three, three, three, six and 15.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.210
Now I have three plus one, which is.

04:03.760 --> 04:08.990
Or hopeless existing and lost and is 20 2015 is 35.

04:09.540 --> 04:14.190
And here I have five, 15, 35, 70.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.310
If I have done the calculation, they say now this is one of the approach in which you're going do it

04:20.310 --> 04:25.780
because the constraints are kind of very less 1000, so you can make a table and do this.

04:26.520 --> 04:31.980
So there's an additional thing in this that there are some cells which have a stone rate or a wall.

04:33.390 --> 04:34.000
Ball Square.

04:34.440 --> 04:34.730
Right.

04:34.740 --> 04:35.550
So that was great.

04:35.550 --> 04:38.430
And which I cannot go to before this is going.

04:38.610 --> 04:39.780
What is the total amount of.

04:40.850 --> 04:43.250
What are the number of ways in which I can reach to this end?

04:43.280 --> 04:43.970
It is zero.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.180
I cannot resist it.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.920
So whenever I get this squared away, it's simply my zero.

04:48.950 --> 04:50.630
Otherwise, I'll use this simply because it.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.190
Approach, right?

04:54.870 --> 04:55.170
Well.

04:58.770 --> 05:00.780
Let's go that out in the next fight.

05:00.930 --> 05:04.300
And this shouldn't be very tough for you guys.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.490
So whenever we have a hash and somebody say zero, it's very easy.

05:09.330 --> 05:10.350
Eight and.

05:12.300 --> 05:17.670
Let me give you some extra knowledge here, which is let's say I'm starting from one comma one and I'm

05:17.670 --> 05:18.690
going to encomium.

05:21.580 --> 05:24.850
So what is the length of this part?

05:25.910 --> 05:26.840
Well, what?

05:26.840 --> 05:29.450
Give me the land of any part if I'm just going right down.

05:32.170 --> 05:35.650
Then the end of any party by just going right door down can be.

05:37.510 --> 05:39.670
Is is constant trade, which is.

05:43.880 --> 05:47.270
If I'm going right, that means I'm actually moving column wise.

05:47.870 --> 05:50.390
In the end, how many rights I have to take?

05:51.020 --> 05:52.700
I have to only take at minus one.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.590
Right, because I'm one.

05:54.590 --> 05:55.190
I have to go to him.

05:55.610 --> 05:55.830
Right.

05:56.060 --> 06:01.970
And if I'm moving down, if it's just me making a down step, that means I'm moving closer to the last

06:01.970 --> 06:02.180
rule.

06:02.850 --> 06:03.800
The how many downs?

06:03.800 --> 06:05.030
Kinetic and minus one.

06:06.020 --> 06:06.320
Eight.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.850
You can see in this example if I go from one comma, 1 to 5.

06:13.330 --> 06:14.880
Hopefully I become a five.

06:15.340 --> 06:16.420
Then I'll have 5 minutes.

06:16.420 --> 06:17.770
One for bliss, for eight steps.

06:18.160 --> 06:23.710
No matter which parts you take, you'll have your steps because you are moving right or you're moving

06:23.710 --> 06:28.480
down so that you are moving towards the last column audio moving towards the last row.

06:28.870 --> 06:32.410
It doesn't matter in which order you go, the count will be same.

06:33.430 --> 06:38.250
Now we have to just find out what is the total order in which I can go.

06:38.260 --> 06:38.620
Right?

06:39.040 --> 06:41.590
So what I do is I simply use combinatorics in this case.

06:42.550 --> 06:43.700
So what is the case here, guys?

06:43.720 --> 06:45.280
What's the combinatorics formula?

06:45.310 --> 06:49.270
They tell me the length of it is end plus and minus two.

06:50.190 --> 06:51.100
Eight summits.

06:51.150 --> 06:52.110
I mean, both of them.

06:53.060 --> 06:55.670
And I have to fill them with writing down.

06:55.910 --> 06:57.720
So how many nights I have I have.

06:57.740 --> 07:01.940
And minus one night to fill and down, how many downs I have I have and minus one down.

07:01.950 --> 07:04.990
So who knows what more to what can I see?

07:05.630 --> 07:10.000
What if I fill this particular part with end minus rundowns?

07:10.790 --> 07:12.590
Let's say I just fill it with some downs.

07:14.890 --> 07:21.310
That means the rest of the places, how many places are left and plus and minus two, minus and minus

07:21.310 --> 07:23.870
one will be equal to and minus one, right?

07:24.100 --> 07:27.460
So the east of the M minus one places will be filled with right automatically.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.640
So what I'm saying is if I just select.

07:32.750 --> 07:36.440
And minus one places out of all in plus and minus two places.

07:36.860 --> 07:40.640
I simply get I simply feel Denver don't and the rest are they can be filled with.

07:41.180 --> 07:41.520
Right.

07:42.410 --> 07:49.940
That is the number of ways in which I can go from one one to encomium, which is also equal to endless

07:49.940 --> 07:52.160
M, minus two C and minus one.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.050
So what's the different way of saying this?

07:54.590 --> 07:55.550
Different way of saying it?

07:55.550 --> 07:56.960
Is that other?

07:58.490 --> 07:58.690
That.

07:59.670 --> 08:01.560
Out of all them, plus and minus two places.

08:01.890 --> 08:04.170
Fill those with m minus one, right?

08:04.860 --> 08:07.170
The other will be filled with Down's itself.

08:07.960 --> 08:08.180
Okay.

08:08.190 --> 08:12.810
So if the they will be filled with donated, then will have a but they don't write down and constructing

08:12.810 --> 08:17.490
it and of course will reach encomium only because we have exactly minus one.

08:17.490 --> 08:17.790
Right.

08:17.790 --> 08:20.000
And exactly and minus one else.

08:20.860 --> 08:22.740
So let me give you this example.

08:22.800 --> 08:28.680
So here, if I'm going from one one, two, five, five, what I have is five plus five minus two C

08:29.700 --> 08:30.450
five minus two.

08:30.480 --> 08:30.870
Right.

08:30.870 --> 08:32.520
So it is it's four.

08:33.210 --> 08:35.880
It is eight, seven, six, five.

08:37.180 --> 08:42.970
A bond for Victorian which is four, three, two, one, two, four into two.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.010
The into two.

08:45.040 --> 08:48.310
So it is ten into seven, which is 70.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.300
Well and we can easily see reward 70.

08:53.610 --> 08:55.150
I hope you understood this part also.

08:55.170 --> 09:01.710
But yes, you cannot apply this formula in the this problem because we have blockers.

09:02.460 --> 09:05.730
So five blockers, we have to kind of subtract the number of ways.

09:06.060 --> 09:07.020
It's a bigger.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.440
Because of hate.

09:10.100 --> 09:15.290
So the best answer would be just to make the table and apply normal dictation.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.800
So let's do this and see in the next part.
