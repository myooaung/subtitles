00:00.490 --> 00:02.440
I also let's understand this problem.

00:03.160 --> 00:09.130
It's very interesting problem from cold forces and this is from educational round 73.

00:09.460 --> 00:17.260
And the problem is deep pain and a very interesting problem that I always like this problem and I always

00:17.260 --> 00:19.060
use it for educational purposes.

00:19.870 --> 00:20.230
So.

00:21.340 --> 00:24.160
You have a fence consisting of and vertical boards.

00:24.490 --> 00:28.540
So feel free to posit and trade yourself and then you can always come back.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.400
So you have a friend.

00:30.700 --> 00:34.330
You have a fence consisting of any vertical board.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.090
The weight of each board is one.

00:37.090 --> 00:38.830
The height of the board is borders.

00:40.420 --> 00:45.910
You think the defense is great if there is no pair of adjusting boards having the same height?

00:46.910 --> 00:48.590
I'd be more formally.

00:48.590 --> 00:55.250
The fence is great if and only if for all indices from to do in the condition it not equal to a minus

00:55.250 --> 00:56.260
one also.

00:57.770 --> 01:01.330
Unfortunately, it is possible that no fences not great.

01:01.340 --> 01:02.810
But you can change it.

01:02.930 --> 01:05.540
You can increase the length of the Iot world by one.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.060
But you have to pay a ruble for it.

01:08.780 --> 01:19.820
So basically, for any Iot fence, what I can do is for any Iot board, what I can do is I can increase

01:19.820 --> 01:22.550
its length by one, by being by rubles.

01:22.790 --> 01:26.810
If I want to increase its length by two, that means I have to pay by.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.370
Plus by just doing the bidding.

01:28.640 --> 01:34.460
If I want to increase its land by three, then I have to pay rent to be a rubles eight.

01:35.030 --> 01:39.080
The length of the each board can be increased any number of times, possibly zero.

01:40.110 --> 01:45.310
They calculate the minimum number of rubles you have to spend to make defense great again.

01:46.290 --> 01:46.550
Eight.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.400
So that means.

01:47.910 --> 01:49.680
But what we have is initially.

01:50.570 --> 01:52.580
We have some boots, they have some height.

01:52.910 --> 01:55.340
I can increase and decrease the rate so they know too.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.140
I just in boots have the same height.

01:57.710 --> 02:01.880
And secondly, there's a cost of increasing the rates.

02:02.480 --> 02:08.960
So I have to find out the minimum cost in such a way I increase and decrease the rate so that finally

02:08.960 --> 02:12.660
the minimum number of rubles I spend it.

02:13.010 --> 02:17.020
So you have to answer the Q independent queries rate.

02:18.780 --> 02:23.110
I q queries I have rn and what each end lines I have.

02:23.190 --> 02:26.430
NBA is nothing with the land of the board right now.

02:26.430 --> 02:30.300
NBA is nothing but the cost of increasing the board by one eight.

02:30.720 --> 02:34.260
So it is going to do to the answer will not increase and it's very routine.

02:34.260 --> 02:36.960
So I just have to take intense, long, long wait.

02:37.320 --> 02:38.760
And it was all my problem.

02:38.880 --> 02:43.770
And for each query print one integer dominion number of rubles you have to spend to make the friends

02:44.340 --> 02:45.470
great a.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.830
So let me go over the first example, a.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.910
The first example is to.

02:56.420 --> 02:56.750
To.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.690
The 2 to 3 is the end of the trade.

03:00.690 --> 03:03.630
I'm just taking things vertically so that don't understand.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.990
And the second is 415.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.810
So this is eight and this is V eight.

03:10.560 --> 03:17.330
Now here you can see that 2 to 3 is not a good fence because we went to our decision.

03:17.850 --> 03:21.120
So what I can do is I can increase the land of this two by one.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.240
But then I have to increase the land of this tree by one again.

03:24.720 --> 03:25.340
Let's see.

03:25.650 --> 03:26.130
Let's see.

03:26.370 --> 03:30.030
I increase this land of two by one, 2 to 3, three.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.160
And what will the cost?

03:31.170 --> 03:32.130
The cost will be one.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.520
Now, again, I have to increase the land of this next city.

03:36.480 --> 03:40.800
Or again, there can be two possibilities as it increases the length of this tree.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.360
Ordinary resilience of this tree.

03:43.020 --> 03:49.710
If I increase the land of this tree, what I'll get is I get to fourth tree and I spend one more a double

03:49.710 --> 03:50.010
on it.

03:50.280 --> 03:51.120
Or I can do it.

03:51.120 --> 03:56.760
I can say two, three, three and two, three and four, and I spend one favorable on it.

03:57.340 --> 03:57.760
Right.

03:58.290 --> 04:03.270
So here you can see from 2 to 3, 2 to 4, three, the answer, the minimum answer that I can see is

04:03.690 --> 04:03.990
two.

04:04.470 --> 04:09.900
There can be another possibility, which is just to increase the length of this two good tree that will

04:09.900 --> 04:13.740
give me 3 to 3 and the cost will be four three.

04:15.090 --> 04:16.950
What is the meaning of all the goals this is for?

04:17.190 --> 04:18.680
This is to.

04:18.690 --> 04:20.130
And this is why.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.980
So the answer should be to let me check.

04:23.550 --> 04:23.840
Yeah.

04:23.850 --> 04:25.400
So here you can see we have two.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.390
And let's see the second case.

04:27.750 --> 04:31.980
The second cases to the two or to all of them are equal.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.830
And then three and six.

04:35.670 --> 04:42.000
So some of you might be thinking of a greedy approach, like which of them have the lowest numbers?

04:42.030 --> 04:43.560
That means the lowest cost.

04:43.740 --> 04:45.210
Why don't I just increase it?

04:45.870 --> 04:49.200
But guys, you can easily see if you increase it, then.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.390
There are some problems.

04:52.440 --> 04:59.190
The first problem is firstly if it has the lowest Rubel, it does not guarantee me that increasing it

04:59.190 --> 05:01.490
will of course give me the right answer.

05:02.040 --> 05:02.610
What if?

05:02.940 --> 05:08.430
What if the existing ones offered a different rate and even if they are just when offered the same.

05:08.520 --> 05:09.810
For example, see this case.

05:10.230 --> 05:12.900
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

05:14.130 --> 05:15.780
Or instead of this, let me.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.850
It has to go.

05:18.990 --> 05:27.090
You know, what I believe is that this is a greater talent that means to verify or to contradict your

05:27.090 --> 05:28.540
own solution.

05:29.340 --> 05:34.710
So if you have proposed a solution, try to contradict your own solution, vaunted work.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.840
That's a greater challenge, actually.

05:36.870 --> 05:42.990
It's a greater talent that I think that I think because it's what happens when you give long challenges,

05:42.990 --> 05:43.290
right?

05:43.620 --> 05:46.110
You mean the solution, but that doesn't work.

05:46.550 --> 05:47.190
You're trying.

05:47.190 --> 05:49.290
You try and you tried for days and.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.500
More days and then you summited, right?

05:53.040 --> 05:56.820
So, okay, before moving there, let me just have some.

06:02.950 --> 06:04.570
Instead of this, let's have this.

06:04.570 --> 06:05.910
Five, six, seven, eight.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.060
No, no, you can see it lit.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.100
It is vulnerable.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.630
And this is three rubles to rubles.

06:12.850 --> 06:16.030
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

06:16.150 --> 06:20.980
Or instead, let's just say that it is 111, one, one one.

06:22.510 --> 06:23.260
If I.

06:24.660 --> 06:24.930
Yeah.

06:25.230 --> 06:27.630
So the first thing is if I.

06:28.740 --> 06:29.280
Okay, that's it.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.740
This is the.

06:30.900 --> 06:31.890
And this is only one.

06:32.820 --> 06:36.660
Now, if I increase this three by one by delegates, I'll get two votes.

06:37.260 --> 06:39.720
Then I will have to increase one of these two force by one.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.540
Then I immigrate to five, then to six, and so on.

06:42.810 --> 06:43.080
Eight.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.750
So greedy would always not work here.

06:45.930 --> 06:46.090
Eight.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.820
Because there can be so many cases.

06:47.820 --> 06:49.550
And we have already discussed this.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.720
There are so many cases possible.

06:52.020 --> 06:55.020
That means this is our dynamic programming problem.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.780
And so for the second case, let's see what's done.

06:57.780 --> 06:59.790
So for the second case that you can see.

07:00.980 --> 07:03.290
We have all these tools now.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.670
What what can we do?

07:05.130 --> 07:09.970
Other increase the middle to buy one that will give me two, three, two.

07:09.980 --> 07:15.560
And it's a valid fence and the cost of it is ten or what I can do is increase the first two and the

07:15.560 --> 07:21.710
last two, and this will give me 3 to 3 and the cost will be three plus, which is.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.830
998.

07:24.280 --> 07:25.840
So let's pick.

07:26.320 --> 07:26.660
Yes.

07:27.010 --> 07:28.120
Nine is the minimum cost.

07:28.120 --> 07:33.880
And in the last one, you can see all the fences have the different combinations.

07:33.910 --> 07:35.860
Eight, that is one, three, two.

07:35.860 --> 07:38.800
And this that means it is already a great fence.

07:38.800 --> 07:42.430
I don't have to spend any of it to increase the size of any of the board.

07:43.030 --> 07:43.250
Eight.

07:44.720 --> 07:50.540
So what I would suggest is just pause the video, try to think about it, and then we can discuss it.

07:51.680 --> 07:51.910
Okay.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.190
Yeah, let's discuss it now.

07:54.610 --> 07:59.600
So the first is 2 to 3 and the cost of it is four one, five, eight.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.720
So what I say is I'll see.

08:03.310 --> 08:04.180
Tell me the answer.

08:04.450 --> 08:07.510
That means the minimum cost of variable spend.

08:07.810 --> 08:08.950
If I increase.

08:10.580 --> 08:13.790
The current element by one, two or three eight.

08:13.940 --> 08:15.890
So what I'll do is I see nothing.

08:15.890 --> 08:16.820
But I just see.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.720
Let me quickly you.

08:26.390 --> 08:31.890
So how can you think of a dynamic programming solution in this, first of all?

08:32.280 --> 08:36.340
Okay, so let's say this is zero two index first and second index of 012.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.910
Now, what all possibilities do I have?

08:39.210 --> 08:48.660
I have infinite possibilities of possibilities to increase the size of the board by one or the first

08:48.660 --> 08:48.780
of all.

08:48.780 --> 08:50.940
So it is very simple not to increase it.

08:51.450 --> 08:53.790
That means increase it by zero eight.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.660
So the second possibilities, if I increase the size of this board by one, by two by three, by four

09:00.750 --> 09:06.570
by five, and so until infinity rate, that means in this case, variables will be used in this case

09:06.570 --> 09:10.320
two and to be able to be used in this case three and to be able to be used and so on.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.670
But now what we have to do is we we need to limit this.

09:14.670 --> 09:21.120
We need to limit it because here, if you go deeper into it, if you try deeper into it, what will

09:21.120 --> 09:25.410
realize is that going after three is a waste of time.

09:25.410 --> 09:32.550
Basically, if I say that I want to increase the current numbers, that is the current board size bite

09:33.480 --> 09:34.650
or instability.

09:34.650 --> 09:37.980
If I increased by four, it will never give me a good solution.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.330
Eight Because see.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.070
Two plus zero can be a good solution.

09:42.070 --> 09:44.650
That means I'm not increasing it to plus one.

09:44.650 --> 09:48.550
I can increase it by one because if I increase it by one, it will.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.370
Okay, let me make guesses.

09:51.660 --> 09:58.300
The ultimate thing that we want is what we want is we want it to be different from its left and its

09:58.300 --> 09:58.660
right.

09:59.620 --> 10:03.010
But when will we need when will we need to increase it by one?

10:03.100 --> 10:04.900
We will need to increase it by one.

10:05.110 --> 10:06.100
When this is the case.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.440
Let's say this to two and one.

10:09.160 --> 10:13.720
In this case, if I just increase the second one by one, then it will solve my problem.

10:14.230 --> 10:16.450
I don't need to increase this by two.

10:16.990 --> 10:17.260
Correct.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.790
By increasing by one can only solve a problem.

10:21.420 --> 10:22.560
So when?

10:22.950 --> 10:26.040
So do we need a key is when I need to increase it by two, maybe.

10:26.060 --> 10:26.460
Yes.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.320
We have already seen that case.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.690
It is 2 to 3 and later to Sten.

10:30.690 --> 10:32.250
It is 15 and it is one only.

10:32.490 --> 10:37.770
In this case, if I increase this two by one, I will get to three three and then I can again increase

10:37.770 --> 10:39.870
it by one, two, four, three.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.490
Now two, four, three.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.750
We can easily see that.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.460
Nor do I do things the same.

10:44.460 --> 10:45.960
And the cost as minimum which to.

10:46.990 --> 10:48.780
I did not think about the kids.

10:48.780 --> 10:53.610
When you will be needing to bless tree, that means you will be needing it to increase it by a land

10:53.610 --> 10:54.030
of three.

10:55.160 --> 11:01.790
I just think of a case that the minimum answer is coming by, not increasing by zero or to zero or one

11:01.790 --> 11:03.410
or two eight, but by three.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.820
So you will soon realize I just pause it and think about it.

11:08.060 --> 11:09.950
Just try to make some cases and see.

11:10.490 --> 11:13.160
Will you ever be needing to increase it by three?

11:14.490 --> 11:15.030
No right.

11:15.420 --> 11:22.470
You will never be needing to increase any element but only remain like use zero rubles.

11:22.470 --> 11:24.750
Used by rubles are used to be rubles.

11:24.990 --> 11:26.040
You don't need to.

11:27.660 --> 11:33.660
Go beyond to write the story will never be needed because I made the case it was zero and one I don't

11:33.660 --> 11:37.590
have a basis for needing it increased by three.

11:38.810 --> 11:43.610
Ultimately watching the game is not easy, but very simple that it should be different from the live

11:43.610 --> 11:45.040
and it should be different from the raid.

11:45.380 --> 11:51.470
Eight So some of you might be thinking that, okay, maybe this is the case where you can be increased

11:51.470 --> 11:56.240
by one three and it can be increased, but when it is just four and then it can be increased by one,

11:56.240 --> 12:02.420
it is just five because three is here for this year and we need it to reach two five to make it different.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.840
But why do we want to increase two in this case?

12:05.840 --> 12:09.200
Because here you can see it is already different from the.

12:10.240 --> 12:10.430
Right.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.170
One's eight.

12:11.470 --> 12:14.230
That means a two is different from four into a different room.

12:14.290 --> 12:15.760
I mean, it is already on.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.220
It is already a good fence.

12:19.390 --> 12:20.170
But we don't.

12:21.140 --> 12:24.670
Actually need to increase the fences, by the way.

12:24.860 --> 12:26.810
So what I've done is I have just taken a.

12:29.000 --> 12:29.500
Let me.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.060
It is a little bit.

12:33.270 --> 12:34.440
I've just taken this.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.960
I just took this.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.070
It's already been eight.

12:42.310 --> 12:44.080
But what I say is I simply say nothing.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.620
But I simply say I repeat, I committee and I see that.

12:49.090 --> 12:52.990
Tell me what's the best answer or the minimum rubles used to correct?

12:54.810 --> 12:55.290
Correct.

12:55.540 --> 12:56.910
First I would.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.280
First I would.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.600
And increasing.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.460
The current.

13:06.650 --> 13:08.330
Increasing the current board budget.

13:11.170 --> 13:14.660
Followed by day eight.

13:15.100 --> 13:21.310
And believe me or not, this is the same problem as the problem we have already done, which is the

13:21.310 --> 13:22.270
pain dose problem.

13:23.110 --> 13:26.920
Let me let me try to connect it to the pre and post problem so that you can solve it yourself.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.530
I look to the cases to do three.

13:30.100 --> 13:36.190
Now we know we cannot increase this to buy zero accumulated plus zero plus one or plus two.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.590
So plus zero will be two only plus one it will be three and plus two will be put.

13:41.800 --> 13:46.930
Same for this two, three, four and for this for delegate are three, four and five.

13:47.200 --> 13:47.490
Correct.

13:47.950 --> 13:50.380
So now what I have is independent this problem.

13:50.380 --> 13:58.540
You must have related articles at RG or B I can be in the house with odd g, r b basically if I take

13:58.540 --> 14:02.440
this, I cannot take this, but I can take this.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.280
Eight basically consecutive elements cannot be same.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.940
I just have to take the best answer of that element, which is Nazim.

14:10.540 --> 14:12.100
And the second one is the cost.

14:13.430 --> 14:15.890
Towards the cost of increasing by zero one and two.

14:15.950 --> 14:17.330
So what's the cost?

14:17.330 --> 14:19.300
If I take the state, it is zero.

14:19.310 --> 14:22.670
So for the state the cost is zero because I'm not incrementing them.

14:23.270 --> 14:24.320
Or the second state.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.100
What is the cost?

14:25.130 --> 14:27.200
The cost is four one in five.

14:28.130 --> 14:32.900
But if I take this data, this forward, if I take this data, this one, and if I take this trade,

14:32.930 --> 14:34.100
it is five.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.550
And finally, what is the cost of increasing it by doing this?

14:37.550 --> 14:40.490
Nothing but four into two, one into two and five into two.

14:40.490 --> 14:40.940
Which is.

14:43.300 --> 14:43.530
Okay.

14:43.570 --> 14:48.970
So I'm just trying to relate it to the house, the painters problem, so that you can realize that it's

14:49.150 --> 14:51.310
not it's exactly the same problem.

14:51.340 --> 14:56.320
I know what I need to do is I need to find some sequence of this.

14:56.890 --> 14:57.160
That's.

14:57.170 --> 14:58.060
That the.

14:59.570 --> 15:01.910
Lost in that sequence is minimum.

15:03.230 --> 15:05.270
Exactly same as the windows from eight.

15:05.510 --> 15:09.010
And the second thing is the cost should be minimum here, of course.

15:09.020 --> 15:11.990
But the second thing is no to a decent element can be.

15:14.260 --> 15:16.850
So in this case, I cannot take two, three, three, eight.

15:17.020 --> 15:18.520
In this case, I can take two, three.

15:19.770 --> 15:25.350
But which is not in zero one and five, and this will give me six eight.

15:25.710 --> 15:27.840
The second case can be if I just.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.360
The second option can be this.

15:33.450 --> 15:42.060
There is this to this, which is two for three, which will give me a sum of zero plus two +08.

15:42.360 --> 15:47.460
So this is exactly the same problem as the Windows problem, and I'm not coding it.

15:47.460 --> 15:48.960
I leave the code to you.

15:49.830 --> 15:55.380
And the first thing and this too was raised that it's a dynamic programming problem.

15:55.710 --> 15:58.860
This was the most important aspect of the problem, right?

15:59.160 --> 16:03.240
It is a running programming problem and it requires rotating programming solution.

16:03.630 --> 16:10.140
Second aspect was that, of course, infinite students are possible, but what's my optimal substructure?

16:10.830 --> 16:11.130
Eight.

16:12.060 --> 16:17.520
More than optimal state aid to the optimal states are nothing but plus zero, plus one or plus two.

16:17.730 --> 16:21.150
That will give me the best answers to of course I can take plus three.

16:21.360 --> 16:25.770
I can also add one more here and you know, you get out these solutions.

16:25.980 --> 16:30.720
Eight We can figure out the solution by taking one, moreover, making them two plus three.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.630
But that will never give me the best answer.

16:34.140 --> 16:41.430
That means I'm just redundantly calculating something that will be just a waste of time and memory.

16:42.060 --> 16:43.800
One you can take plus three.

16:43.800 --> 16:50.460
But that answer would just can only come from plus zero plus one industrial well, so just go for this

16:50.730 --> 16:54.960
and try to submit it on the phone first and see if you are doing something wrong.

16:55.410 --> 16:56.700
I provided the solution.

16:57.150 --> 16:57.460
Thanks.
