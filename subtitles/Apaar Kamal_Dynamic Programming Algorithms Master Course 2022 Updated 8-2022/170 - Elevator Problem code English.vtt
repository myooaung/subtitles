WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:00.810
Right.

00:00.930 --> 00:02.280
So let's go to this problem.

00:02.430 --> 00:10.530
And I have this written here, which is then in five or ten years, the weight of the elevator, which

00:10.530 --> 00:15.390
is X and five, is N, and I have these five which H have just taken the input.

00:15.750 --> 00:19.930
Now what we want to do is we want to find out the values of FMG.

00:20.640 --> 00:20.850
Right?

00:21.270 --> 00:29.250
So we basically we need to be at a rate of what are the states in F, so F contains a set so it will

00:29.250 --> 00:31.410
have one to race to the ballot and states.

00:31.650 --> 00:31.920
Right.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.650
And similarly G will also have those many states.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.840
So what I'll do is I just take a pair.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.160
Of Indian, and I call it best rate.

00:41.310 --> 00:44.100
And I'd say that this is these many states.

00:44.880 --> 00:50.100
So because we know for a particular F okay we're are with recursive yeah.

00:50.520 --> 00:57.750
For one particular effendi that means for one unique set I want to find out values of F g and those

00:57.750 --> 01:00.810
values are kind of tied together so that they can appear here.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.150
You can feel free to take off and do independently.

01:04.150 --> 01:05.220
It doesn't matter, actually.

01:06.060 --> 01:14.210
So in this case, what happens is that we of some mosque dart first is nothing but that set.

01:14.970 --> 01:23.070
That said, whatever it is, it's f value rate F of mosque and best mosque dart second.

01:24.540 --> 01:26.160
Instead of best lips quality.

01:30.200 --> 01:30.580
So deep.

01:30.580 --> 01:32.630
Debbie Moscow, Michigan is nothing worthy of mass.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.250
There is a minimum wage that was used.

01:35.370 --> 01:37.140
To try to make this more stable.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.990
I do make this subsector of it.

01:40.770 --> 01:43.160
So, yeah, let's build a base case.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.420
So we know the base case was very simple.

01:45.420 --> 01:46.740
We discussed it, which is this.

01:47.610 --> 01:50.160
And for phase one and f g of zero.

01:50.370 --> 01:50.640
Right.

01:50.910 --> 01:54.000
So let's say DP is DP of zero.

01:54.300 --> 01:57.780
That is five is one comma zero verdict.

01:58.170 --> 02:00.630
Now, let's iterate over all the mask.

02:01.850 --> 02:07.850
Musk starts from one because we already feel the value of zero and it will go for one less often for

02:07.850 --> 02:09.890
all these objects full.

02:10.940 --> 02:13.120
And now simple.

02:13.220 --> 02:19.420
If I want to add the debt element paid, if I want to add digital element into the mass.

02:19.430 --> 02:26.150
So before moving on to the G8 element, let's just mark something, let's just mark let's just give

02:26.150 --> 02:28.040
this DB mod something big value, right?

02:28.250 --> 02:31.490
So that it takes because we'll be taking minimum range.

02:31.550 --> 02:33.620
So it just take the correct minimum 40.

02:33.620 --> 02:33.980
Right.

02:34.490 --> 02:35.720
The first one is the right.

02:37.210 --> 02:38.980
Which is right.

02:38.980 --> 02:41.280
And the second one is Wait, wait.

02:41.590 --> 02:42.580
So don't get confused.

02:43.180 --> 02:49.090
So what I'll do is if I want to add digital element into the current mask, what I see is that the dead

02:49.180 --> 02:51.010
weight of the mask should be set.

02:51.550 --> 02:51.850
Right.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.950
And just give me a sec.

02:54.220 --> 02:54.530
Right.

02:54.610 --> 02:57.220
So this has a bad timing.

02:57.430 --> 02:57.660
Yeah.

02:57.670 --> 03:00.590
So what I would say is simply save mask, right, Shivaji?

03:01.210 --> 03:03.550
And what that means.

03:04.610 --> 03:09.670
The good bit of my spouse said that means I if there did be Damascus said I'll get educated.

03:09.920 --> 03:10.140
Yeah.

03:10.430 --> 03:11.650
So it's similar to this.

03:11.660 --> 03:16.040
If these you know, the British said that means I have to depend on its answer.

03:16.190 --> 03:16.610
Correct.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.410
Because here you can see this.

03:18.770 --> 03:23.630
This is the with the way they instead of they let me by them.

03:24.810 --> 03:26.910
If I want to divide person to the.

03:29.110 --> 03:30.310
Now what that means.

03:31.260 --> 03:35.490
Now a divided person is actually coming into the elevator.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.640
That means 5% is the last one to come into the elevator.

03:38.880 --> 03:42.720
And I tried this for all device that will give me the best answer rate.

03:43.620 --> 03:43.910
Yeah.

03:44.100 --> 03:48.510
So if divide person was the last one to enter this mask, then.

03:50.060 --> 03:50.750
Very simple.

03:50.900 --> 03:56.330
There are two options only include white person and or excluded.

03:56.330 --> 03:57.980
So I'll only included if.

03:59.330 --> 03:59.660
Okay.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.990
Before moving forward, let's take parent aid.

04:03.350 --> 04:06.620
So let's take the new mask where the answer depends on the aid.

04:06.860 --> 04:07.940
That means if.

04:09.640 --> 04:15.410
The subset which does not contain the virus, and there will be nothing but masks or one left.

04:16.870 --> 04:17.130
Right.

04:18.110 --> 04:20.260
So it's not right.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.910
So this is the new mask.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.010
And let's.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.130
What is the answer on the new mask?

04:26.160 --> 04:32.390
Let let's just take the normal answer, which is wearing what was kept on the new mask grade where we

04:32.390 --> 04:34.430
depend on where we are and so depend on.

04:35.840 --> 04:36.970
What was kept there.

04:36.980 --> 04:39.470
So let's stick a temp, right?

04:39.470 --> 04:41.270
Or let's call previous rate.

04:43.380 --> 04:45.650
So what is the previous age values?

04:45.660 --> 04:47.670
So it is nothing but deeply new musk.

04:48.940 --> 04:49.240
Correct.

04:49.990 --> 04:55.210
So whatever was the minimum number of right for the previous vote for the new mosque or the previous

04:55.210 --> 04:58.630
mosque, and then that's kept you full.

04:59.140 --> 05:02.770
So what I simply say is if I if I want to include divide percent into the.

05:04.730 --> 05:05.290
LS.

05:05.300 --> 05:05.570
Yeah.

05:06.820 --> 05:07.060
Okay.

05:07.060 --> 05:10.240
Did I do something else?

05:14.080 --> 05:14.370
Okay.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.820
I don't know why this.

05:17.960 --> 05:21.140
Well, I think there is some bracket misplaced.

05:21.740 --> 05:23.510
Okay, let's begin from here.

05:23.690 --> 05:29.990
If I want to include divided percent into the current months, what I'll simply say is, if this previous

05:29.990 --> 05:33.300
writes right's second value, what is the second value?

05:33.320 --> 05:35.660
Nothing but the way the previous rates fade.

05:36.110 --> 05:40.700
Plus the current guys weight, which is device.

05:42.040 --> 05:42.430
Wait.

05:42.430 --> 05:43.330
So wait off.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.050
Why?

05:44.560 --> 05:47.650
If this is less than equal to X, I can include him in the way.

05:48.760 --> 05:49.120
Okay.

05:50.300 --> 05:57.980
I can include him into my where do we say currently if I want, including my I will simply say it is

05:57.980 --> 05:58.370
nothing.

05:58.670 --> 06:00.440
So what happens with the previous rate?

06:00.740 --> 06:04.670
The previous rates first doesn't change.

06:05.180 --> 06:06.140
So it is same rate.

06:06.590 --> 06:08.690
That means I'm not increasing the rate.

06:09.050 --> 06:09.890
It's the same thing.

06:10.130 --> 06:11.420
But previous rate rate.

06:11.420 --> 06:15.410
Since there is this second value of it, that is the devalue of the previous rate change.

06:16.070 --> 06:16.550
That is.

06:17.570 --> 06:17.990
Nothing.

06:17.990 --> 06:22.190
But, uh, I'll just add the current guys.

06:22.190 --> 06:22.970
We're in this.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.580
So it's doing this.

06:26.580 --> 06:30.990
And the second part of it is if I exclude the person X.

06:32.370 --> 06:36.880
Include the percent rate or exclude divide.

06:38.060 --> 06:38.500
Person.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.790
That means I can only assume the.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.080
He's weird.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.570
And the previous age was greater than x.

06:44.720 --> 06:45.350
So if.

06:45.830 --> 06:48.980
So, if I'm excluding the person, that means now I'm starting a new right.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.900
New ride with y, right.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.460
Starting a new date with vaporizes.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.410
Simply say previous rate or first place.

07:00.560 --> 07:05.330
That means whatever the number of rates were there for the previous month, now their rates have increased

07:05.330 --> 07:12.130
by one because now we have a new rate and seconding for the new video we will write the second.

07:12.140 --> 07:16.220
That means a new video will be just the weight of Y by just the weight of y.

07:16.220 --> 07:20.960
Because he's going alone in this new what I write no bull.

07:21.290 --> 07:28.070
And what I'll do is whenever I've got the answer from the previous date instead of previous rate, let

07:28.070 --> 07:29.480
me write it as option.

07:30.590 --> 07:34.760
This was that option that we had these two options and whatever was the option, what?

07:34.760 --> 07:38.630
I'll simply say that view of the current mask is nothing but minimum of.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.140
Whatever the best option it got.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.820
That means minimum of the minimum rate, whatever it got.

07:45.830 --> 07:48.140
And this, that is the current option.

07:48.650 --> 07:51.080
But all the options, I'm just taking their minimums.

07:52.320 --> 07:52.580
Cool.

07:52.850 --> 07:54.080
So what does this mean?

07:54.110 --> 07:58.040
That means this 110 can be made from via 111.

07:58.040 --> 08:01.730
One can be made from 110101 or 011.

08:01.970 --> 08:02.750
So whatever.

08:02.810 --> 08:05.030
Best number of rates they all give me.

08:06.490 --> 08:08.510
I'll take the minimum rate.

08:08.710 --> 08:12.280
And of course, you can say that this is a parenting.

08:12.370 --> 08:13.690
So the first one is right.

08:13.690 --> 08:16.150
So the minimum number of eight it will depend on.

08:16.360 --> 08:21.250
And the second is, if the writer's name, it will just take the minimum weight, whichever it is giving

08:21.250 --> 08:23.740
it the minimum eight to finally.

08:24.260 --> 08:25.420
Oh, okay.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.640
I think I, I.

08:28.930 --> 08:31.240
There's something bad with the brackets.

08:34.820 --> 08:37.490
They let me build it and take a building.

08:37.520 --> 08:37.710
Yeah.

08:38.090 --> 08:40.040
So it's building and where the final answer is.

08:40.190 --> 08:41.930
So the final answer will be nothing.

08:41.930 --> 08:47.660
But I want to carry all the people so deep of one left shift.

08:48.830 --> 08:50.510
And minus one.

08:50.510 --> 08:52.010
That means carrying all the equipment.

08:52.010 --> 08:52.700
And what's the.

08:53.930 --> 08:55.150
Minimum number of rights.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.350
So the minimum number of rights is nothing but first.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.510
So in this, what I can see is.

09:00.500 --> 09:00.900
Okay.

09:01.370 --> 09:02.300
What I have got.

09:02.660 --> 09:03.320
Well, sorry.

09:03.320 --> 09:04.730
I am printing it for all the.

09:06.590 --> 09:06.950
Correct?

09:07.400 --> 09:07.670
Yeah.

09:08.030 --> 09:08.810
No, it's fine.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.230
I always had this indentation issues.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.330
So this is the first.

09:15.410 --> 09:17.390
So this is the of rights, which is true.

09:17.390 --> 09:24.320
And if we want to print what is the minimum number of weight that was used in the last eight that also

09:24.320 --> 09:26.420
I can bring now.

09:26.460 --> 09:26.780
Right.

09:27.230 --> 09:30.020
That means this value which is stipulated checking.

09:30.290 --> 09:32.030
And here we can see the minimum growth rate.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.260
In the last it was nine.

09:33.260 --> 09:36.470
That was three plus six, eight.

09:36.560 --> 09:43.350
And the mean and the previous rate that was before this nine was this that is five plus three plus two,

09:43.370 --> 09:43.970
which is ten.

09:44.420 --> 09:47.090
So I hope you got the problem and the solution.

09:47.090 --> 09:48.440
And it's a very nice problem.

09:48.860 --> 09:49.280
It's.
