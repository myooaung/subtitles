WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:01.460
Welcome, everyone.

00:01.880 --> 00:04.520
Let's talk about an ordered six eight.

00:04.520 --> 00:07.250
And as I told you, it won't be that easy to call.

00:07.580 --> 00:11.510
And there are some findings that I have done around this problem.

00:12.410 --> 00:18.400
Of course, if you find something interesting about it, let me know as well and even comment it.

00:19.640 --> 00:20.090
And.

00:20.450 --> 00:20.680
Yeah.

00:22.880 --> 00:23.790
Oh, yeah.

00:23.810 --> 00:24.260
So yeah.

00:24.260 --> 00:26.270
So you need to do what happened in the first.

00:26.270 --> 00:28.640
We have one only in two we have two and three.

00:28.640 --> 00:29.120
We have three.

00:29.120 --> 00:32.990
So the important point is I would say it is an increasing.

00:35.020 --> 00:38.770
If we have this increasing property then we are trying to write recursion.

00:39.370 --> 00:42.640
Then it will always give me a unique bit.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.330
It will always give me in an ordered beer.

00:45.700 --> 00:46.090
Where?

00:47.210 --> 00:55.160
The idea does not matter because if I have any too I mean, if I have any multiple looks, if I have

00:55.160 --> 00:58.490
one plus three plus one plus two, it just same as one plus.

00:58.490 --> 00:59.090
One plus.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.930
Two plus three, which is same as three plus two plus one +18.

01:04.170 --> 01:10.770
If I sold all of them, they will become same and they will become same, which is one plus one less

01:11.800 --> 01:13.440
+38.

01:13.440 --> 01:20.100
So I'm just using this property that if I saw some random things and they are unordered, then.

01:21.330 --> 01:23.760
They will give me the same apple.

01:26.330 --> 01:32.630
So yeah, let's code this by writing a simple recording and then we'll see how to do it.

01:33.170 --> 01:36.530
So how will you maintain this increasing property?

01:36.530 --> 01:37.160
By writing.

01:37.160 --> 01:37.610
Recording?

01:38.840 --> 01:45.530
But what I can do is I can see that I have a number for the let me add some space these areas.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.630
Let's have an amber for it.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.170
But I will say I will divide it.

01:50.430 --> 01:55.210
I see right now the minimum value that I'm using to partition.

01:55.210 --> 01:55.930
This is one.

01:56.290 --> 01:57.250
I'll start with this.

01:58.180 --> 01:59.380
And then what will happen?

02:00.770 --> 02:05.600
I'll partition one and the rest will be ready.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.120
Now the new minimum is one two.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.130
Basically, it will be, yeah.

02:12.330 --> 02:15.330
The minimum is one still party in history.

02:15.330 --> 02:18.570
And let's see, I'm also just for your explanation.

02:18.570 --> 02:20.940
I'm just writing the answer there and partitioning it.

02:20.940 --> 02:26.820
And this was one I can also partitioning because as I said, it is minimum is one note and I want it

02:26.820 --> 02:27.600
to be increasing.

02:28.080 --> 02:34.200
I can also partition it by using to the new minimum that becomes two because I'm starting my partition

02:34.200 --> 02:34.910
with two.

02:35.940 --> 02:38.700
So the number that is left is to the new.

02:39.390 --> 02:44.030
It is that I'm getting is two and the minimum that I'm getting is to let me write in the table is minimum.

02:44.520 --> 02:48.390
And and this is for the explanation purposes.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.270
The example.

02:51.260 --> 02:53.160
The third one is the eight.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.790
So let's say I'm taking three as the minimum.

02:56.250 --> 02:57.290
I'm starting it with three.

02:57.290 --> 02:59.240
And I and we just left is one.

03:00.260 --> 03:05.960
So I know it is a slightly confusing this minimum thing, but when we go to it, we will understand

03:05.960 --> 03:13.280
it in a better way, maybe a little recorded for us that you can see actually what I'm talking about.

03:13.760 --> 03:13.920
Okay.

03:14.420 --> 03:17.570
So initially what I'll do is yeah, let me move this.

03:18.230 --> 03:19.700
Initially, I'll just take an.

03:20.820 --> 03:24.930
It's important and I know this for while to see out and.

03:26.770 --> 03:27.280
Count.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.030
Unordered.

03:29.930 --> 03:30.190
Eight.

03:30.560 --> 03:34.850
And in this aisle, this bus and and in Italy, I'm digging one as the minimum.

03:35.150 --> 03:40.250
They don't partition it with anything less than one in Italy.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.760
So let's say an ordered.

03:45.450 --> 03:46.860
And it's a minimum.

03:46.860 --> 03:54.900
And let's say we have an eight or so how how I want to partition and I want to partition in by something

03:54.900 --> 03:57.800
which is greater than equal to this minimum.

03:57.810 --> 04:01.350
I mean, it is at least at this minimum variety, I think, min.

04:02.750 --> 04:05.290
And this I say.

04:05.350 --> 04:06.920
I will start from Min.

04:07.070 --> 04:08.740
I will vote.

04:09.350 --> 04:13.100
And I am partitioning this.

04:14.450 --> 04:16.010
By using a boat.

04:19.140 --> 04:26.460
Simply building on city zero and even partitioning and just ask the new minimum now will become I because

04:26.900 --> 04:32.190
it little I'm starting from minimum value whatever was there they want to partition it by adding this

04:32.190 --> 04:33.710
minimum or something greater than this.

04:33.720 --> 04:33.990
Right.

04:34.170 --> 04:38.730
So even partitioning by something greater than this, let's say this minimum plus one or two or three

04:38.730 --> 04:42.160
or whatever, then the new minimum becomes eight, eight.

04:42.270 --> 04:46.710
Because now I cannot go less than I will always try to go greater than eight.

04:47.100 --> 04:54.810
So DPI and and minus C because I've already taken this eight, I already have this got eight, I already

04:54.810 --> 04:58.440
partition by and I'm trying to grow something which is greater than it.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.150
Tim Lee finally ended.

05:01.150 --> 05:01.720
And the answer?

05:03.120 --> 05:10.830
It can be slightly confusing for a lot of us, but this is I mean, important to understand.

05:10.980 --> 05:11.940
It's pure recursion.

05:12.690 --> 05:17.310
I'm just partitioning N into something which is greater than or equal to me.

05:17.580 --> 05:18.210
This is important.

05:18.610 --> 05:18.810
Well.

05:20.460 --> 05:20.760
Yeah.

05:20.760 --> 05:25.210
So if story, if anything was originally written, one, that means I found a way and I just printed

05:25.520 --> 05:25.760
it.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.300
Let's see what I got.

05:29.450 --> 05:29.810
Okay.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.480
So it's not repeat count on ordered.

05:34.520 --> 05:34.730
Hmm.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.570
So far, four.

05:35.570 --> 05:36.040
I have five.

05:36.230 --> 05:37.670
Okay, so let's do one thing.

05:37.820 --> 05:40.240
Let's put in this whole series eight.

05:40.250 --> 05:41.490
So instead of just four for.

05:41.540 --> 05:44.540
Let's read for every number from 1 to 20.

05:45.890 --> 05:46.150
Eight.

05:47.190 --> 05:52.260
So this becomes let's pass ESPN and let's see what is the.

05:54.140 --> 05:55.250
It is that we are getting.

05:57.170 --> 06:01.010
So as in the unordered side of things, the series that we were getting was.

06:01.980 --> 06:03.090
A tourist to the barbers.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.910
But in this case, what is this resort I'm getting?

06:05.910 --> 06:14.880
It is one, two, three, five, seven, 11, 15, 22 and 30, 42, 56, 77.

06:15.210 --> 06:18.690
I'm I can't figure out if it is a particular series or not.

06:19.410 --> 06:19.640
So.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.850
For some educational purposes.

06:22.850 --> 06:23.570
What I'll do is.

06:24.790 --> 06:29.350
I tell you how to figure out what cities this is?

06:30.640 --> 06:33.640
In that case, what I will do is we'll just take some fewer terms of the cities.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.710
Let's say one, two, three, five, seven, 11.

06:36.620 --> 06:38.190
Let's take the first few dumps.

06:39.040 --> 06:45.660
I've taken the first few dumps and I've written or ERISA uses nothing but online encyclopedia and tedious

06:45.670 --> 06:47.190
sequences rule.

06:47.590 --> 06:51.450
So this is the forces that I get from is due to its grand opening.

06:51.820 --> 06:54.460
As you can see, this is the city that we are worried about.

06:55.390 --> 06:56.680
What an equals to zero.

06:57.580 --> 06:58.180
It is one.

06:58.450 --> 07:00.520
And then this starts from one eight.

07:00.730 --> 07:05.470
So if I start remaining close to zero, then I'll get the exact 68.

07:05.510 --> 07:07.210
So it is one one, two, three, five, seven.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.910
So it is same one one, two, three, five, seven, 11, 15.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.510
This is online Encyclopedia of India sequentially.

07:13.510 --> 07:16.840
I'm just sharing it so that it will be very useful to be.

07:23.130 --> 07:28.200
Not able to optimize it further and led to the onset of the problem in the particular series.

07:28.650 --> 07:34.320
What we can do is we can just put in total written numbers of the series by writing a brute force code,

07:34.560 --> 07:38.280
and then we can search for that series on the online encyclopedia of integers.

07:39.210 --> 07:40.380
Now, what does this do?

07:40.530 --> 07:45.270
It tells me everything, each and every detail about any of the series that exist.

07:45.870 --> 07:46.460
Of course there is.

07:46.470 --> 07:53.490
I mean, there are millions of cities, but yes, this will tell me everything about the cities.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.480
Rachel, let's see this.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.530
This is a name given to the cities and the number of partitions.

07:58.530 --> 08:01.340
Often this is what we are also trying to find out.

08:01.340 --> 08:03.030
Date the partition numbers.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.710
So it's called the partition numbers.

08:04.980 --> 08:06.160
And this is the whole city.

08:06.180 --> 08:07.680
So here are the first few dumps.

08:08.040 --> 08:12.450
If you want to look at some more terms, you can of course, go to the links.

08:12.930 --> 08:18.030
And what I always do is I try to go down and see the formula about it.

08:19.110 --> 08:21.690
So this G.F. is nothing but generating function.

08:21.690 --> 08:23.530
So this is high level meant something.

08:23.550 --> 08:30.000
What happens is if for a particular cities, okay, let's say let's search Fibonacci numbers in this.

08:30.180 --> 08:37.830
So it is one plus one and one plus one, two, three, one, one, two.

08:38.750 --> 08:41.300
And three, five.

08:42.120 --> 08:46.710
It or a straight line what I did and what I got.

08:46.710 --> 08:49.320
I got the crazy this Fibonacci numbers.

08:49.500 --> 08:54.750
And it has given me the direct formula for it, which is f you go strip in minus one bicep and minus

08:54.750 --> 08:56.370
two the direct recursive relation.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.940
We have it and it will tell you it in every detail about this series.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.930
It means you can read it if you want to.

09:04.050 --> 09:07.180
But let's get back and let's see how to use it.

09:07.290 --> 09:08.700
So these are generating functions.

09:09.270 --> 09:10.680
This is also generating function.

09:11.130 --> 09:13.950
This is another interesting property offered.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.210
Something related to Pentagon numbers.

09:18.120 --> 09:25.290
This is another interesting thing that Ian is approximately equal to one divided by four into an described

09:25.290 --> 09:29.220
of three into Irish to devour pie in the sky enough to win by three.

09:29.700 --> 09:33.900
And this is what might be was denied by Hardy and Ramanujan.

09:33.930 --> 09:34.650
We know about this.

09:34.650 --> 09:36.090
Agent Ramanujan with the famous.

09:37.070 --> 09:40.160
A mathematician and Hardy was his professor.

09:40.400 --> 09:40.670
Eight.

09:42.030 --> 09:43.600
So this is approximately equal.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.990
So this is not we're worried about and.

09:47.280 --> 09:55.050
Again, we have some other relation to another series to this, any industries and which is equal to

09:55.050 --> 09:58.790
this particular series, which is the longest given, you can see.

09:59.370 --> 10:01.130
And so this is also what we want.

10:01.560 --> 10:07.950
So I actually searched for a particular formula that if I did some one one formula so that I can directly

10:08.250 --> 10:12.030
put it in often, but I was not able to get any rate.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.180
That means this this this series is very interesting.

10:15.930 --> 10:17.700
It doesn't have a special formula.

10:17.700 --> 10:23.770
That means it cannot be predicted, means a particular number cannot be directly found out, because

10:23.790 --> 10:28.080
we have to find the previous numbers, finding forward numbers.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.930
So there's no one solution of this series.

10:32.000 --> 10:32.070
You.

10:32.810 --> 10:33.410
Let's get back.

10:34.280 --> 10:37.710
Yeah, but tell me, what is the, um.

10:38.230 --> 10:39.470
The complexity of this code?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.230
Well, you can see I have mine.

10:41.240 --> 10:41.600
I have.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.720
And if I memorize it, then it will be minimum.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.370
And Darwin will be the.

10:47.550 --> 10:48.090
What we see.

10:49.510 --> 10:55.040
The state's minimum interest rate is also equal to in it can go from 1.8.

10:55.580 --> 11:00.580
We have an enduring state and for all those two states, we are doing some work in this for a loop.

11:00.580 --> 11:06.100
Often this is off and into and into any type of solution optimization.

11:07.260 --> 11:08.330
You all can memorize it.

11:08.340 --> 11:11.450
I'm not memorizing it because they're easy to memorize it.

11:11.860 --> 11:16.880
It it is off and cube solution, which is kind of big.

11:17.880 --> 11:22.560
And as I said, I was not able to find an off one solution of the series.

11:23.680 --> 11:23.980
Eight.

11:25.140 --> 11:32.080
Like direct any relation so that I can make a formula which is directly based on and there wasn't any.

11:33.060 --> 11:33.880
So what I'll do is.

11:34.960 --> 11:41.680
I have another interesting solution to this problem, which actually fascinated me as well.

11:41.680 --> 11:45.700
And I'm still figuring out the why is that solution working right?

11:46.180 --> 11:48.840
So I'll share their solution with all of us here.

11:49.120 --> 11:54.700
And then if any one of you is able to figure out any recourse in religion that might suit it.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.080
You're welcome.

11:56.080 --> 12:00.190
And you can even commented and tell us all.

12:00.310 --> 12:02.570
But I just share this solution with you.

12:02.570 --> 12:02.860
Right?

12:04.090 --> 12:05.230
So here it is.

12:05.260 --> 12:07.240
The off end.

12:08.630 --> 12:09.350
And in doing so.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.450
It's what is orphaned into an solution.

12:14.890 --> 12:15.130
Yeah.

12:15.580 --> 12:16.060
Let's see.

12:16.060 --> 12:22.030
I have some deep theory and it's deep and or it's in plus one.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.950
So what do they say.

12:23.950 --> 12:25.150
Deep zero equals to n.

12:25.150 --> 12:27.580
So we we all know that deep zero is equal to one.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.600
There is a base is eight, if any zero and one will.

12:32.470 --> 12:32.920
No.

12:33.460 --> 12:35.050
Now is the time.

12:35.830 --> 12:36.070
Yeah.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.530
So let's just see this.

12:40.470 --> 12:43.890
I found it online and I just shared it with you.

12:44.350 --> 12:47.370
So I will start from one I will go to in full.

12:48.450 --> 12:54.240
A view on the loop inside it, which is g eight and D will start from my.

12:55.180 --> 12:56.780
They will go down and.

12:56.960 --> 12:57.960
And what will happen?

12:57.960 --> 12:58.530
Just see this.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.310
What will happen?

13:00.330 --> 13:04.710
DP de Blessing goes to DP J minus.

13:05.010 --> 13:12.240
Hey, look, look, if this just if I win, if I'm not able to find out why this solution is working

13:12.510 --> 13:15.870
and giving me the correct answer, this video will be there.

13:16.170 --> 13:23.190
If I'm able to find out that this solution has a specific reason, then I did it in.

13:23.190 --> 13:24.310
This will do it right.

13:24.780 --> 13:26.800
What happens is what is happening?

13:26.820 --> 13:31.140
DP de plus it goes through dp j minus i.e. in this case two.

13:32.100 --> 13:36.220
Let's see what all values are we getting after each of these iterations?

13:36.240 --> 13:37.380
They try to just print.

13:38.790 --> 13:39.990
Let me just bring this.

13:40.980 --> 13:47.730
Let me just bring up after all these iterations happen to keep close to zero killers, any goal to end,

13:47.730 --> 13:49.140
quote, deep.

13:53.000 --> 13:53.250
Eight.

13:53.720 --> 13:54.950
And this will.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.270
Let's see.

14:02.400 --> 14:02.820
Okay.

14:03.060 --> 14:08.490
So before that, what we can do is let me mark other deposits as zero eight.

14:08.490 --> 14:16.130
Remember to become a zero comma side of it because all those garbage values are put over here.

14:17.260 --> 14:18.430
Ma'am missed?

14:18.580 --> 14:19.370
No, ma'am.

14:19.390 --> 14:19.780
Sit.

14:22.030 --> 14:22.270
Right.

14:23.080 --> 14:26.290
So instead of four, let's do it for and.

14:27.230 --> 14:31.040
And then let's see what what's happening in Italy.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.950
We have one because we know zero is one.

14:34.170 --> 14:34.970
So what's happening?

14:35.300 --> 14:40.250
All the deep dos do starting from one and going in the first iteration that I'm talking about, the

14:40.250 --> 14:47.990
first line it will be equal to deep will be equal to it will add deep Jew minus an ice one, basically

14:48.320 --> 14:50.810
adding the previous letter in Italy.

14:50.810 --> 14:51.650
All of them are.

14:52.130 --> 14:52.520
Okay.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.770
Let me bring the initial of.

14:55.960 --> 14:56.690
Fingers here.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.080
Let's bring it here.

15:01.350 --> 15:03.450
So in the first line it is 1000.

15:03.780 --> 15:04.590
Then what's happening?

15:05.890 --> 15:08.010
EPI day, minus one, Rachel.

15:08.140 --> 15:11.800
In the first iteration, the PGA Classic goes to the PGA minus one.

15:12.250 --> 15:13.230
Then deep, deep.

15:13.290 --> 15:14.980
Plus he goes to the PGA minus two.

15:15.310 --> 15:16.030
As you can see.

15:16.980 --> 15:19.620
It is blessing to DP D-minus to.

15:20.820 --> 15:24.310
Then do minus three in the minus four, five, six, seven and so on.

15:24.330 --> 15:27.960
As you know, you can see now that you can see that it is the same.

15:29.520 --> 15:39.270
It is the same cities that we want, which is this 11235721123, five, seven, 11, 15, 2211.

15:39.270 --> 15:41.040
15, 22, 30.

15:42.120 --> 15:45.450
And the last one is 48.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.620
So have you good fortune.

15:46.620 --> 15:48.150
Because I've put into the above.

15:48.150 --> 15:49.560
Here, let me bring it down.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.620
So here we'll see.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.850
It will be 40.

15:56.770 --> 15:58.600
So in each step what is happening?

15:58.600 --> 16:00.790
All these diagonal numbers are being finalized.

16:00.820 --> 16:03.010
We have one was finalized, then this one is finalized.

16:03.010 --> 16:04.150
Then this two is very loose.

16:04.540 --> 16:09.520
Three, five, seven, 11, 15, 22.

16:10.660 --> 16:12.430
30 and then this 48.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.230
They are being finalized one by one.

16:15.690 --> 16:17.260
And until today.

16:17.260 --> 16:24.880
I'm just wondering, how can it lead to a particular record ovulation or resolution or how am I building

16:24.880 --> 16:25.120
this?

16:25.600 --> 16:25.900
But.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.670
I'm still figuring it out, Nate.

16:28.940 --> 16:37.280
If anyone, if you dig deeper into it and try to figure it out and always let me know and you can always

16:37.700 --> 16:39.350
make an update video of this.

16:41.240 --> 16:41.450
Yeah.

16:41.690 --> 16:47.120
So let me put in 1015 and you can see that all of them will work eventually.

16:49.610 --> 16:49.840
Eight.

16:50.690 --> 16:52.040
So this is the cities that we want.

16:52.040 --> 16:58.610
And in case this is an orphan square solution, so ideally recorded an orphan girl solution after memorization.

16:59.120 --> 17:04.030
This is Orphan Square Solution VI and Square, although the streets are end only.

17:04.050 --> 17:06.590
But you can see what all we are going for.

17:06.590 --> 17:09.380
All right, so this isn't orphan work here.

17:09.890 --> 17:12.290
If there's an orphan work and there end state.

17:12.710 --> 17:14.780
So it is Orphan Square solution.

17:15.900 --> 17:16.150
Well.

17:16.860 --> 17:17.250
So.

17:17.640 --> 17:18.810
Thank you, everyone.

17:19.170 --> 17:19.620
Let's.

17:20.610 --> 17:24.820
I'm just waiting to hear something from your brain on this particular solution.

17:25.260 --> 17:29.100
And I'm sure they could put things.
