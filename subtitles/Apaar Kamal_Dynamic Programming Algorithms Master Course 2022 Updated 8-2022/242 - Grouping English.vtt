00:00.830 --> 00:01.580
Hello, everyone.

00:01.820 --> 00:07.300
Let's see this problem girl grouping from the education contest.

00:07.960 --> 00:13.680
So this is a very nice people with bad math problem already hitting you.

00:13.700 --> 00:14.030
The.

00:15.890 --> 00:16.240
Yeah.

00:16.280 --> 00:22.300
So as we can see and it's very less and generally that's the indicator that it will kind of use bit

00:22.340 --> 00:23.360
mosque in it.

00:23.840 --> 00:29.450
So it's a small thing, but let's see the problem statement and see how it is it.

00:30.140 --> 00:37.400
So first we have we have and it's what each a comedy like basically for each rabbit the complete compatibility

00:37.400 --> 00:40.880
of i.e. and derived is given by an integer 80.

00:42.200 --> 00:48.070
So here is zero because the diagonal will be zero in the matrix that we obtain.

00:48.710 --> 00:54.530
And it is a symmetric matrix that means compatibility of IGC with compatibility of G8.

00:54.980 --> 00:56.660
Good for each.

00:56.810 --> 00:57.140
Yeah.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.260
Now that it is dividing the end words into some groups.

01:00.290 --> 01:06.380
So through the person who's dividing this and average into some groups, so he's grouping them rabbits.

01:06.470 --> 01:08.240
So as the name of the problem.

01:08.930 --> 01:13.010
Now each rabbit must belong to exactly one group.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.050
So this is the important concept here.

01:15.380 --> 01:15.590
It.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.990
It's basically we're making some partitions.

01:18.990 --> 01:22.460
We can say that if we are making some partitions or.

01:22.500 --> 01:28.140
But the problem is when we talk about partitions, the order of the elements is fixed, right?

01:28.930 --> 01:33.090
That this is the order in which elements are at the end we are making partitions, but here the order

01:33.090 --> 01:34.470
of the elements is not fixed.

01:35.510 --> 01:39.230
Of course we are making some groupings, but we also have to keep in.

01:40.750 --> 01:44.290
Keep in mind that the order can also change, correct?

01:45.310 --> 01:48.250
Let me quickly share what I mean from that.

01:48.790 --> 01:54.130
When we talk about partition problems, we see that let's say this is the order.

01:55.830 --> 01:56.610
This is the order.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.720
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

01:59.730 --> 02:03.480
And when we are partitioning them, we say, okay, this is one partition, this isn't partition and

02:03.480 --> 02:05.110
this isn't partition, correct?

02:05.400 --> 02:10.730
But in this case we are doing the same thing, but instead the order can also change.

02:10.740 --> 02:13.020
That is, it can also be this.

02:15.640 --> 02:15.880
Right.

02:16.660 --> 02:19.060
This can be another partition.

02:20.270 --> 02:23.210
I think that means the order of the groups can also change.

02:23.660 --> 02:24.220
That means.

02:24.230 --> 02:24.490
Yeah.

02:24.930 --> 02:25.140
So.

02:26.070 --> 02:30.680
But it's not a party symbol problem, but maybe a follow up depredation problem we can see.

02:31.130 --> 02:32.490
And yeah.

02:32.510 --> 02:35.000
So here he sees that dividing into some groups.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.100
These individuals belong to exactly one group right after joining after grouping.

02:40.490 --> 02:44.240
But each Hindu thought owns a comedy point.

02:45.670 --> 02:51.850
If Robert and they belong to the same group, that's important to find Toro's maximum possible total

02:51.850 --> 02:52.180
score.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.730
But a beautiful problem.

02:55.510 --> 02:56.890
Well, let's see.

02:56.890 --> 02:57.760
Let's understand this.

02:58.030 --> 03:01.600
Look, for example, in this example here, I can see this group will have zero.

03:02.980 --> 03:07.120
What, zero, maximum possible total score would be zero for this group.

03:07.750 --> 03:08.620
What about this group?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.940
Part of the maximum possible total score for this group.

03:12.450 --> 03:14.820
So we can see the maximum possible total score.

03:15.750 --> 03:19.350
I mean, the total score of this group is nothing but 85.

03:20.320 --> 03:20.540
Less.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.450
836 less.

03:22.690 --> 03:23.290
Five six.

03:24.240 --> 03:24.570
Right.

03:25.170 --> 03:26.190
So this is important.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.300
Their compatibility plus their compatibility plus their compatibility.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.180
Basically the compatibility of everyone in that group.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.010
This will give me a zero again.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.030
And this will give me a.

03:38.520 --> 03:47.010
Even for as the so totally compatibility of this arrangement can be it three three +36 plus a56 plus

03:47.010 --> 03:49.200
e one, four, eight.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.320
Here we can see that the compatibility is negative as well.

03:52.650 --> 03:53.010
Right?

03:53.490 --> 04:00.090
If the compatibility can be negative, so will I ever get the maximum possible total score, which is

04:00.090 --> 04:00.510
negative?

04:01.730 --> 04:06.110
Think about this, we will not wait because if you are getting a maximum possible total score, which

04:06.110 --> 04:09.410
is negative, then we can always group the elements in this way.

04:10.440 --> 04:11.650
In the individual order.

04:11.910 --> 04:13.950
Now, that means if I have this grouping.

04:14.910 --> 04:19.620
Mandatory probiotics aid in this grouping, all of the comparatively zero.

04:19.620 --> 04:22.200
So the maximum capacity here will be zero.

04:22.230 --> 04:26.430
If all these elements had a negative compatibility with each other.

04:27.240 --> 04:27.500
Correct.

04:28.170 --> 04:32.580
So just to make sure that they don't get the answer, don't go negative.

04:32.760 --> 04:37.480
Just wanted to hear this that it will never go negative eight.

04:39.430 --> 04:44.980
To really solve this problem, much like the elevator problem we discussed in the private business section.

04:45.710 --> 04:48.160
So the problem is very simple.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.890
What we'll do is let's say we have a set.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.030
Well at in this set, I want to add an element.

04:55.030 --> 04:55.620
Correct?

04:56.470 --> 04:56.830
Correct.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.710
It means of these already said.

04:59.710 --> 05:04.990
And I know what is the maximum value of that particular set as respect to this question.

05:05.920 --> 05:11.200
So this set, you don't have to worry about how is that calculated or anything, because that's all

05:11.200 --> 05:16.450
the people say we calculated for our particular problem and dividing to some problems and we ask it

05:16.450 --> 05:18.490
to calculate it in the same fashion.

05:19.660 --> 05:22.810
So let's talk about this case when I already have a set.

05:23.810 --> 05:26.720
And I want to add X to that particular set.

05:27.150 --> 05:27.500
Correct.

05:27.650 --> 05:28.160
That means.

05:28.460 --> 05:28.730
Okay.

05:28.730 --> 05:29.740
Let me write it.

05:29.740 --> 05:29.990
Did hear.

05:31.700 --> 05:35.000
S is a sect which contains some rabbits.

05:35.810 --> 05:37.940
So it not necessarily be the last.

05:38.210 --> 05:42.410
For example, what I mean is, let's see, under three, four, five is a set rate.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.450
What is its maximum?

05:45.200 --> 05:48.470
Best value is being calculated, right?

05:48.920 --> 05:51.800
It's already been calculated because when we do that, I don't have to worry about it.

05:52.070 --> 05:55.670
I'm just saying, what if I add six to the in the same oval?

05:55.670 --> 05:57.150
My answer change eight.

05:57.560 --> 05:58.910
So yeah.

06:00.330 --> 06:02.750
Let let me just keep let's just keep it hidden.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.950
Now let's say I'm adding X to this said.

06:04.980 --> 06:05.270
Right.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.300
So there are two things.

06:06.690 --> 06:07.620
What is the first thing?

06:08.310 --> 06:14.610
The first thing is that if I start a new set, if I start a new group.

06:15.990 --> 06:16.950
New group Phoenix.

06:19.410 --> 06:19.800
Right.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.840
And the second thing is ADD.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.950
Ex in the.

06:25.770 --> 06:26.450
Previous group.

06:27.340 --> 06:29.080
PBS group.

06:32.200 --> 06:32.680
As.

06:33.670 --> 06:33.920
Eight.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.320
What does this mean now?

06:36.100 --> 06:40.870
Indirectly, when I'm acting as when I'm acting x2 s.

06:40.870 --> 06:42.280
There are two things happening here.

06:42.850 --> 06:43.180
So.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.010
Okay.

06:45.220 --> 06:46.100
So this is this.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.400
Which is one, two, three, four, five.

06:48.520 --> 06:48.870
Right.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.210
And if I want to add six into the set now, include the six that I read.

06:52.210 --> 06:55.180
Also, entertainment is the best value or the best grouping possible.

06:56.080 --> 06:56.530
So what?

06:56.740 --> 06:57.740
So I have two options.

06:58.090 --> 06:58.330
Eight.

06:58.660 --> 07:05.260
The first option is that I say just go and find out what whatever was the best value of this service.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.860
And I say I start I'm starting a new group with six.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.120
Correct.

07:10.420 --> 07:13.870
And the second thing can be you tell me that.

07:15.010 --> 07:20.110
If I figured out the best possible answer for one, two, three, four, five.

07:20.140 --> 07:25.810
Let's say the best answer came from this grouping that is 1 to 3 as one group and four or five as the

07:26.260 --> 07:26.830
last group.

07:27.280 --> 07:27.680
Correct.

07:27.700 --> 07:30.850
So this is very possible because we have and we have two things.

07:30.950 --> 07:31.210
Okay.

07:31.210 --> 07:31.900
Let me write it.

07:32.650 --> 07:33.400
We have two things here.

07:33.430 --> 07:37.690
First is the value or let's say the max value of S.

07:39.050 --> 07:41.750
Max value of.

07:42.750 --> 07:43.100
S.

07:43.650 --> 07:45.290
I mean, it's the answer office.

07:45.300 --> 07:48.000
They basically if they say, tell me what is the best answer?

07:48.310 --> 07:51.120
The second thing here is that the.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.140
That or instead.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.790
Let's see, the last grouping.

07:56.570 --> 07:57.380
The last.

07:58.810 --> 07:59.410
Grouping.

08:04.060 --> 08:09.160
I'll just keep maintain I just maintain these two things which will give me give us the final answer

08:09.170 --> 08:16.300
rate because we can see that max value of any set s dash which is nothing but as and in fact I want

08:16.300 --> 08:19.180
to add a particular value to that particular set.

08:19.750 --> 08:19.950
Eight.

08:20.530 --> 08:23.740
So two options right at the start.

08:23.740 --> 08:24.820
A new group with this is.

08:25.740 --> 08:27.210
And in this case, we had this.

08:27.510 --> 08:27.770
What?

08:27.960 --> 08:29.810
Give me whatever the best possible answer was.

08:29.980 --> 08:30.180
Pretty.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.490
One, two, three, four, five.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.870
And do something and start a new group with six.

08:34.590 --> 08:38.550
So we'll we'll move on to the values later, whatever the values it contains.

08:38.550 --> 08:41.340
But just try to understand all the options that I have.

08:41.820 --> 08:48.480
The second option here is why don't I add six into the previous group I'm in, the last group of previous

08:48.480 --> 08:50.460
said, which is one, two, three, four, five, eight.

08:50.580 --> 08:53.430
So that group can be any group we don't know.

08:53.430 --> 08:56.670
It depends on the value of that particular set.

08:58.520 --> 09:03.440
Now, as we can see here, over here, we have two options as to the max value.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.150
And the second is a large grouping of X.

09:05.390 --> 09:08.360
Let's try to, you know, maintain a balance.

09:08.360 --> 09:13.580
We're doing the let's try to refine them and let's try to get the new values.

09:14.660 --> 09:17.120
So the first one is what is the max value of s?

09:17.540 --> 09:20.090
Basically right now we're talking world s dash.

09:20.490 --> 09:20.870
Correct.

09:21.900 --> 09:22.170
So.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.510
So what would be the max value of dish?

09:25.840 --> 09:29.640
The max value of x as dish now or lets in the new value of his dish.

09:29.650 --> 09:32.980
If I start a new group with x will be very simple.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.400
That is whatever was the max value of.

09:37.770 --> 09:44.250
S because here you can see if I'm starting a new group for this particular guy, X becomes the new group.

09:44.880 --> 09:45.240
Correct.

09:45.720 --> 09:49.410
And if this becomes a new group, is there any value that's being added?

09:49.440 --> 09:51.390
No, because it's alone in that group.

09:51.450 --> 09:53.600
There is no combination that's taking place.

09:53.790 --> 10:00.690
Basically, I'm starting a new group with X eight, so max value of whatever s was there plus zero.

10:01.140 --> 10:03.390
That is the max of his debt in this first case.

10:03.660 --> 10:04.800
And what is that grouping?

10:05.870 --> 10:14.780
Let's say last through, now that I have the last group there, now that I have now is nothing but X.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.740
Because I'm starting a new group with six.

10:19.070 --> 10:20.600
But this is the first case.

10:21.760 --> 10:28.450
For the second case, second cases, and according to the previous group, a group of as many.

10:28.900 --> 10:34.570
If I want to add eggs into the previous group of eggs, what I want is what will be the new max value.

10:35.200 --> 10:41.770
The max value will be nothing but whatever was the max value of s whatever was there of previous set.

10:42.070 --> 10:44.650
Now, okay, let me give you an example.

10:44.890 --> 10:53.560
Now let's see this was this set as and let's its last grouping was four comma five I'm I want to add

10:53.560 --> 10:59.200
six into the last group and we all we have, we are already maintaining whatever is the value of last

10:59.200 --> 10:59.470
group.

10:59.470 --> 11:04.480
So basically we know what a, what elements are there in the last six eight.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.900
So I know we can see four and five are the elements which are inelastic.

11:08.350 --> 11:14.350
So if I have these two elements in the last set and I want to add six into this, it is instead of,

11:14.350 --> 11:17.320
you know, starting a new set with six because that's the first case.

11:17.680 --> 11:24.760
Eight If I want to start a new set with six, this becomes the case for comma five and six, and I have

11:24.760 --> 11:25.990
the values stored.

11:25.990 --> 11:27.820
Of course, we are always calculating value.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.740
So this is the first case that I've discussed here.

11:30.670 --> 11:36.520
Now the second case is if I want to add six into the previous group, so what it becomes, it becomes

11:36.520 --> 11:36.850
this.

11:38.510 --> 11:40.210
Or five and six.

11:40.970 --> 11:45.790
So if I want to add this value into this previous set and what will be the max value, what will the

11:45.790 --> 11:49.440
total value that I have now, the total value that I have now will be the.

11:50.490 --> 11:53.190
Biggest value that is, let's call it.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.730
I have added a max here.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.590
Let's just call it total value.

11:59.310 --> 12:03.060
Total value of that set, eight are total max value.

12:03.060 --> 12:05.010
Both of them works just ignored.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.970
Exciting max volume the max value of the previous set.

12:11.060 --> 12:14.390
Rick Maxwell you the set is whatever was already there.

12:14.750 --> 12:17.960
Plus now I'm just adding six into the last set.

12:17.960 --> 12:18.350
Correct?

12:18.380 --> 12:18.740
Six.

12:18.740 --> 12:20.540
Is it just being added in the lawsuit?

12:20.780 --> 12:21.470
A plus.

12:21.800 --> 12:31.760
This, which is of a guy that I'm adding and all the elements which are in the last eight video belongs

12:31.760 --> 12:33.170
to last.

12:36.530 --> 12:39.830
Because right now I'm I'm trying to explain to the last group.

12:39.830 --> 12:46.430
So if I want to actually do the large probabilistic now this X has to be compatible with four also with

12:46.430 --> 12:50.750
five also, and I just add their values into my new value.

12:51.620 --> 12:52.910
So here I have two things now.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.130
Okay, let's come back here.

12:54.470 --> 12:54.710
Yeah.

12:54.830 --> 12:58.640
So Max always becomes max value express XD, which is.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.790
And J belongs to this last group.

13:02.660 --> 13:11.000
Whatever was the last group of s Rachel here we are tracking OU values continuously max value in large

13:11.000 --> 13:12.230
group max value and Oscar.

13:12.830 --> 13:14.450
Eric and the next one.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.120
And the next thing for this case, that is the last group.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.640
What will be the last group now updated?

13:19.640 --> 13:21.290
Last group after adding x?

13:21.800 --> 13:24.680
The last group now will be nothing but whatever was the last group.

13:25.770 --> 13:26.740
Let's let me write it.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.320
Last group.

13:32.130 --> 13:32.320
Yeah.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.230
Last group of s less.

13:34.890 --> 13:40.950
The current guy that I'm going to add X in this and I'll do this for all the values of x, right?

13:41.100 --> 13:46.860
So if I ever said s and I know that I have one, two, three, four, five value in it, and the total

13:47.160 --> 13:49.770
number of people, total number of rabbit here are ten.

13:50.190 --> 13:53.730
But in this one, if I try to add six, I'll try to add.

13:54.790 --> 14:01.090
So when I tried to add eight a light to a nine, died to a ten and so on to calculate all my sets.

14:01.750 --> 14:02.170
Correct.

14:02.200 --> 14:06.670
So that's how we do when we are talking about subjects, we try to place all the values and we all know

14:06.940 --> 14:08.710
that the ordering also matters.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.870
That means in the first place, it's not necessary.

14:10.870 --> 14:11.860
But it can be.

14:12.490 --> 14:13.120
It can be true.

14:13.130 --> 14:14.290
It can start with anything.

14:15.040 --> 14:15.400
Correct.

14:16.090 --> 14:17.080
The ordering matters.

14:17.080 --> 14:17.380
So.

14:18.340 --> 14:25.990
We'll just try to formulate all possible subsets by adding a particular element X in the previous set.

14:26.530 --> 14:30.820
And when we are trying to add that element X in the previous set, we'll just have two options.

14:31.210 --> 14:37.810
Either start a new group with X or add X into the previous group, previous best group that was there

14:37.810 --> 14:43.270
of D, s and whatever from both these values gives me the max value.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.540
I'll take that because we know this can be negative, right?

14:47.110 --> 14:50.920
If something can be negative, it won't always be greater than zero.

14:51.220 --> 14:55.030
If that can be negative, we have to take a take the max value of both of them.

14:55.970 --> 14:56.230
Eight.

14:57.310 --> 14:57.480
So.

14:57.970 --> 15:03.460
Okay, so let's make one migrant tree so that you will understand what's happening.

15:03.770 --> 15:07.780
So let's all start with the initial set and let's I've only three values.

15:09.540 --> 15:12.300
So initially, what are my values of?

15:14.230 --> 15:14.580
Okay.

15:14.590 --> 15:15.010
Let's.

15:17.180 --> 15:20.230
Let's take these values only into consideration.

15:20.780 --> 15:21.860
So we have three.

15:22.140 --> 15:26.720
I don't mind if the video is a little lengthy, but I just want you to understand what's going on.

15:27.080 --> 15:32.210
If you already saw the elevator problem from the individual with my section, then it becomes very easy

15:32.270 --> 15:33.470
for you to understand this.

15:35.150 --> 15:35.930
So we have three.

15:36.200 --> 15:42.650
So this is the HD values 20012012 and three gross three.

15:42.830 --> 15:44.810
Well, so I have what is my set?

15:44.810 --> 15:48.560
I have this set of one, two and three right now or let's say zero, one, two.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.430
Zero one into eight in.

15:52.700 --> 15:53.570
I'm starting within.

15:54.530 --> 15:55.190
Empty set.

15:55.490 --> 15:59.030
And the last grouping contains zero elements.

15:59.510 --> 16:01.520
The last grouping is nothing more to set.

16:01.880 --> 16:02.140
Eight.

16:02.150 --> 16:03.020
So let's go.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.010
Let me call it a fight.

16:05.430 --> 16:06.210
It will go a little.

16:08.290 --> 16:09.220
Zero and fight.

16:10.030 --> 16:11.650
This is my initial case.

16:11.650 --> 16:12.910
So here I have a beer.

16:13.060 --> 16:17.950
The first the first part of it represents the max value that I'm talking about max value.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.780
And the second part of it represents.

16:21.440 --> 16:25.800
The last group, last group, which is a set eight.

16:25.820 --> 16:31.130
And you all know, whenever I'm trying to restore respect sect and the values are very less, I can

16:31.760 --> 16:34.160
make this larger group as an integer.

16:34.600 --> 16:39.100
But if they're in the red some better that needs do over the elements in their particular classic.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.600
Very well that's an optimization.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.500
We will discuss that later.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.190
But right now, let's focus on the making of the values.

16:45.200 --> 16:45.440
Eight.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.170
Now let's talk about adding one.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.890
Adding zero zero again to this particular.

16:53.650 --> 16:54.660
Said they.

16:55.710 --> 16:59.790
So if I want to zero in this, that means what will be my new set?

16:59.850 --> 17:00.750
It will be zero.

17:01.530 --> 17:03.060
That means my last group is zero.

17:03.060 --> 17:03.240
Right?

17:03.240 --> 17:08.490
Because I've added zero to the empty set and we all know that the sum will be zero.

17:08.490 --> 17:09.840
Only the total maximum value.

17:10.200 --> 17:10.550
Correct.

17:11.220 --> 17:12.440
So here I had two options.

17:12.450 --> 17:14.460
Start a new group with zero added in the last group.

17:14.460 --> 17:18.160
Basically both the options are the same because the last group was right.

17:18.900 --> 17:21.000
Now I have two options again.

17:22.470 --> 17:23.070
Um.

17:23.580 --> 17:23.820
Yeah.

17:24.090 --> 17:25.740
So the second option is that.

17:27.770 --> 17:32.240
Now I can also add one into the last group eight to let me add one into the last group.

17:32.450 --> 17:36.020
Again, the total sum value will be zero because one is alone in the group.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.190
And similarly, I can also add two into my grouping right now.

17:43.050 --> 17:45.390
Zero comma to end this note.

17:46.390 --> 17:46.540
Now.

17:46.540 --> 17:48.810
Let's move forward right here.

17:48.820 --> 17:49.180
Are you again?

17:49.180 --> 17:52.510
See, I've already added zero in to my last group and I know that.

17:53.450 --> 17:54.560
Zero is already set.

17:55.010 --> 17:55.390
Correct.

17:55.610 --> 17:58.440
So this is right now.

17:58.460 --> 18:02.810
What I can do is I can try to add one into this last update.

18:03.060 --> 18:04.280
Let's start with one here.

18:04.710 --> 18:08.740
There are two options and I'll include one into the last setting.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.820
That is the last group that I use.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.120
Or I can start one as a new group.

18:14.780 --> 18:15.080
Correct.

18:17.650 --> 18:23.590
Getting two options as I'm adding one with the large group that is which contains zero or I'm adding

18:23.590 --> 18:27.100
one independently, I'm saying now start a new group with one.

18:27.580 --> 18:27.760
Right?

18:28.200 --> 18:29.140
What happens now?

18:29.440 --> 18:32.020
What is the maximum value if I want to add 120?

18:32.050 --> 18:36.540
So we all know that one should be compatible with zero inverter compatible values of zero gamma one.

18:36.730 --> 18:37.900
It is ten.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.120
So here the max maximum becomes ten.

18:40.150 --> 18:42.430
And in this case I'm starting a new value with one.

18:42.580 --> 18:46.720
The max remains as it is because now there are individual elements.

18:47.020 --> 18:47.530
Similarly.

18:48.550 --> 18:52.270
What happens in this case that I can start a new group.

18:53.470 --> 18:54.820
Let's start with zero here.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.370
Okay, let's start with a zero.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.350
We also have to add two in this.

18:59.350 --> 18:59.660
Right.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.440
So in this case, where we have zero, we have added one.

19:02.440 --> 19:02.740
Right.

19:02.950 --> 19:05.260
But we also have to try to win this.

19:05.770 --> 19:06.110
Correct.

19:06.430 --> 19:10.150
So before moving to the next part, let's start with two here.

19:12.580 --> 19:17.950
So again, if I tried to in this particular grouping, what happens?

19:17.950 --> 19:19.480
I have two options right there.

19:19.600 --> 19:23.620
Zero and two are together or zero is alone and two is also alone.

19:24.310 --> 19:26.200
So what are the maximum values that I get?

19:26.320 --> 19:29.440
If 002 are together, then zero and two should be compatible.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.080
So the maximum loses this 20 and.

19:33.420 --> 19:35.910
If there are alone, it is only right.

19:36.120 --> 19:40.560
Similarly, the same thing will happen for this particular tree, this particular subject.

19:40.830 --> 19:41.970
I have one in the.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.160
I cannot do it and I cannot read zero.

19:44.220 --> 19:46.470
Similarly for this, I cannot zero.

19:46.470 --> 19:47.900
And I cannot say at one rate.

19:48.090 --> 19:49.020
And then again.

19:49.170 --> 19:50.160
Now let's move forward.

19:51.300 --> 19:51.630
Yeah.

19:51.660 --> 19:54.660
So I just stick to this particular guy here.

19:54.810 --> 19:55.760
So what happens now?

19:55.770 --> 19:57.060
I'm going to do this right.

19:57.420 --> 19:57.990
Two options.

19:58.260 --> 19:58.770
Add there.

19:58.770 --> 19:59.610
Add to.

20:00.990 --> 20:01.600
It would be.

20:02.620 --> 20:08.710
Existing group, which is, you know, one and two or whatever was the existing group start a new group

20:08.710 --> 20:08.890
with.

20:10.370 --> 20:10.650
Correct.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.790
If I start a new group too, what happens?

20:15.640 --> 20:16.780
The values remain the same.

20:16.810 --> 20:23.170
And as it is because ten was existing earlier I started a new group that is empty, so that contains

20:23.170 --> 20:25.540
only one element so we don't have to add any other value.

20:25.840 --> 20:31.450
The second part of here is that if I have if I am adding to the existing group which contained the zero

20:31.450 --> 20:35.740
and one nature two and I should be compatible with zero and two should be compatible with one.

20:36.100 --> 20:41.170
If two is compatible with zero, we have 20 and if two is compatible with one, also it is plus minus

20:41.470 --> 20:41.580
two.

20:41.890 --> 20:43.120
Basically it is minority.

20:43.510 --> 20:48.280
If I add two into the previous group for ten minus it is -90.

20:49.000 --> 20:49.280
Correct.

20:50.520 --> 20:53.670
And I hope you are able to see this.

20:53.910 --> 20:58.530
Now, here, what we what we can see is we have all the three elements which is growing into Israel.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.460
If I have all these three elements into my third, then.

21:04.390 --> 21:05.300
You only little.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.620
This is ten, right?

21:06.620 --> 21:07.880
And here we have nine B.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.050
So what is the maximum value?

21:09.290 --> 21:09.830
It is ten.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.860
And also will have two more options here.

21:13.520 --> 21:21.260
If I if I add two with a new group or if I add two in the one that means this, which is zero one,

21:21.620 --> 21:22.720
two and eight.

21:23.060 --> 21:29.600
Or if I say zero one and add two here, in this case, what will be the value?

21:29.600 --> 21:35.870
It is zero plus two and one if I want to, to be compatible with one.

21:35.870 --> 21:36.920
What I have is minus.

21:36.920 --> 21:40.010
And so this will also give me the best answer.

21:40.790 --> 21:45.710
I hope you are seeing that how this B unfolds and how we are calculating that.

21:45.710 --> 21:47.960
What is the previous group we have already stored?

21:48.350 --> 21:49.340
What is the previous group?

21:49.520 --> 21:51.830
C There can be multiple previous group.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.990
For example, in this case you saw it.

21:54.470 --> 21:55.460
I have two groups.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.860
It is zero and one that I know I want.

21:59.430 --> 22:04.050
You know, I won't handle the case when I have to add it into the previous to previous group.

22:04.050 --> 22:09.390
That means I'm adding two into this one, not in the zero, because that is a handle on the other part

22:09.390 --> 22:09.720
of the.

22:11.220 --> 22:15.210
So we'll just only keep track of the last group that is formed.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.660
Not every group that is one that will become very tricky for us.

22:19.380 --> 22:23.550
So if we just keep track of the last group that we have on, we can simply store it as a beat mask.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.590
This is the group that form.

22:25.620 --> 22:29.160
Now try to add this particular guy into this particular group.

22:29.760 --> 22:30.050
Correct.

22:30.840 --> 22:36.270
So in the next video, I ultimately called the solution to this and it's very simple.

22:36.270 --> 22:42.120
I would just suggest you why don't you go ahead writing recursive solution and memorize it.

22:42.970 --> 22:43.260
Eight.

22:44.290 --> 22:45.850
So see in the next part.

22:46.360 --> 22:46.870
Thank you.
