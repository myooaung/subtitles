WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:02.070
So let's call it.

00:04.900 --> 00:06.490
Well, so this was the legislation.

00:06.490 --> 00:07.990
I should be David first.

00:09.070 --> 00:10.180
LC as.

00:13.970 --> 00:14.840
So what's the next one?

00:15.500 --> 00:17.810
Our problem is longest, but.

00:19.930 --> 00:24.520
Copy the input we have anonyme and then we have a directed graph.

00:24.520 --> 00:30.430
So if you are unfamiliar with graph concepts, you can check out our graph algorithm course.

00:30.670 --> 00:33.190
Also, you can check the graph section in this course.

00:33.190 --> 00:34.310
Also late.

00:34.780 --> 00:40.420
And if you are very unfamiliar with the activities, graphs and different types of graphs and trees,

00:40.420 --> 00:47.410
then just lastly, move on to that section like all that, see that, do that and then come back to

00:47.410 --> 00:52.030
this eight or if you want to go deeper and like who?

00:52.970 --> 00:55.220
Know about more topics and graphs.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.400
Then you can simply move on to the graph algorithm.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.540
Cause according to this way, you will get a deep insight on graphs.

01:03.340 --> 01:03.530
Cool.

01:04.170 --> 01:04.530
Cool.

01:04.970 --> 01:05.200
Yeah.

01:05.870 --> 01:06.670
Biology p.

01:07.510 --> 01:08.770
And what I have.

01:10.140 --> 01:10.410
Okay.

01:10.410 --> 01:10.890
Four or five.

01:10.890 --> 01:11.200
Great.

01:11.710 --> 01:12.710
Let's make a graph.

01:12.720 --> 01:16.470
So I usually use this basic decency list.

01:16.470 --> 01:17.430
So what is the length?

01:18.090 --> 01:21.570
It's one 5/8 and it's 75 plus one.

01:30.550 --> 01:32.140
Now let's take input.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.670
So here we have Anonyme.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.020
We have a graph of export push back by.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.440
And this goes till I'm not.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.150
Then I've done this mistake many times.

01:54.190 --> 01:54.430
Yeah.

01:54.580 --> 02:00.250
So get off of exert push back by because we are meeting meeting art director and so the idea sincerely

02:00.280 --> 02:03.530
is we are pushing them back and what we do is very simple.

02:03.530 --> 02:05.770
They will just take a visited node for that.

02:05.770 --> 02:07.270
I don't visit any of it again.

02:09.460 --> 02:15.670
All what we can do is instead of writing a DFS, let's make it look like a DP ray or denim programming

02:15.670 --> 02:16.210
solution.

02:16.510 --> 02:18.760
So what I'll do is I'll move on to all the notes.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.550
Simply say that.

02:24.580 --> 02:25.090
Okay.

02:26.820 --> 02:32.160
This the final service for the end of the longest we'll be able to answer that goes to max opens answer

02:32.160 --> 02:34.500
comma API or is Deepa?

02:34.530 --> 02:38.310
Deepa is the length of the longest but starting from I get an x.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.690
Well, so let's put this DPA function.

02:41.700 --> 02:45.660
So let's say it's current on which I am on the horizontal.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.130
So for current depends.

02:47.640 --> 02:53.520
Let's dig down on the with zero initially and let's move in the adjacency list of this current node.

02:55.050 --> 02:55.350
Eight.

02:55.830 --> 03:00.690
What are the risks in get graph of going into X is going in there since it is of it and what I'll do

03:00.690 --> 03:01.290
is if.

03:03.370 --> 03:08.020
I simply say that onset is max off onset coma BP.

03:10.700 --> 03:16.380
Plus, it gave me the best answer for the challenge for all the drillers.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.440
I'm digging the best one.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.070
Entertaining.

03:19.670 --> 03:23.570
And of course, guys, I don't have to check for the patent case in this case via because.

03:26.770 --> 03:31.450
It's a dedicated group to bid and cannot be indicted since it is struck the cardinal rule.

03:31.660 --> 03:34.980
And in the end, it's spring onset here.

03:35.170 --> 03:36.340
It's written back, Gonzales.

03:40.060 --> 03:40.690
It's really.

03:41.790 --> 03:44.220
So here I got three is three that I've done it.

03:44.640 --> 03:44.940
Yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:45.270
Three.

03:45.750 --> 03:50.920
Well so whenever I'm including an engineer I'm going to simply adding plus one.

03:51.700 --> 03:51.960
Eight.

03:52.170 --> 03:57.000
And no base case is needed because let's say I'm on the last node, I'm gonna leave node.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.350
An answer is zero.

03:59.190 --> 04:00.460
It doesn't have any of this.

04:00.460 --> 04:03.570
So this, for a loop is not working for the leave note because it doesn't have.

04:03.570 --> 04:06.510
I needed to send the list and it simply didn't make zero.

04:06.510 --> 04:10.410
Doing so isn't is the smallest DB problem that you'll ever see.

04:10.410 --> 04:10.710
Right?

04:11.040 --> 04:15.960
But always remember it's in all that and even programming problems are detected is actually graph is

04:15.960 --> 04:23.460
being formed, a dag is being formed and like if I consider all the tiny booming states as the nodes

04:23.460 --> 04:29.490
of this graph and all the transitions as the edges, then there will be a dag and here I have one.

04:29.490 --> 04:30.930
Here one is the length.

04:30.930 --> 04:33.570
Right here it can be cost value.

04:33.570 --> 04:37.560
And if I talk about general DP problems, what is the cost?

04:37.950 --> 04:40.080
Cost can be anything in an empty problem.

04:40.080 --> 04:40.830
The cost was.

04:42.900 --> 04:47.490
The cost was the value that we were getting late in the frogs in problem.

04:47.490 --> 04:52.470
The cost was when the cost was actually minus the difference.

04:53.130 --> 04:55.830
There's this cost value and then this is because of relation.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.120
That's everything about anime.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.920
But I mean, it's a director, basically.

04:59.920 --> 05:00.820
Gruff, always.

05:01.840 --> 05:02.110
Well.

05:02.660 --> 05:03.670
So if I build this.

05:04.780 --> 05:05.680
Yeah, I've got three.

05:06.270 --> 05:10.000
Well, there's one problem here that I want memory stick, selective memory.

05:10.600 --> 05:17.740
Because I can go to any state like many, many times by C and let's say, let's say started with four.

05:18.190 --> 05:20.140
Let's say four was one and one was Ford.

05:20.390 --> 05:24.310
So let's say this was a graph structure started when I calculated it.

05:25.180 --> 05:26.380
Then I went to.

05:27.450 --> 05:31.650
Do I get glitter too by using three and three, getting back to one again?

05:32.220 --> 05:39.450
So this recursive approach goes in this way one, then it goes 2 to 3, and then one.

05:40.020 --> 05:43.740
Then from two it goes to one again and then get miss two.

05:44.220 --> 05:52.200
Now from three it goes to one and then four from from it goes to the one comes back to two and then

05:52.200 --> 05:52.830
goes to one.

05:52.830 --> 05:55.470
Come back two for voice two, three goes to one.

05:56.040 --> 06:00.150
I'm just kind of backtracking everything here these many times.

06:00.240 --> 06:04.050
Recursion will be called in just a simple graph here.

06:04.710 --> 06:06.600
So here we have only four nodes.

06:06.780 --> 06:10.860
So if I don't want to calculate and instead twice I'll simply use memorization.

06:11.140 --> 06:12.630
So let's use memorization.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.220
Memo in and memo said it.

06:19.250 --> 06:22.250
Minus one gamma size of a moon.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.850
And what happens there is improved stuff.

06:29.320 --> 06:29.610
And.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.950
It's a memo current.

06:32.740 --> 06:33.340
And if.

06:35.240 --> 06:39.290
That is not equal to minus one an answer.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.650
Otherwise the answer is zero and do the calculation part.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.350
Well, you guys, it's been delayed again.

06:47.230 --> 06:48.070
And it's submitted?

06:48.070 --> 06:48.280
No.

06:51.770 --> 06:53.800
So all these problems will give you something new.

06:54.750 --> 06:56.020
Right in there.

06:56.050 --> 06:57.480
And you will be able to.

06:59.430 --> 07:01.590
They get an overview of that in on the.

07:02.730 --> 07:05.580
Still, I wouldn't say that you are master of fatally approaching this.

07:06.090 --> 07:08.400
You'll get an overview why I missing.

07:08.430 --> 07:11.600
It's an overview because it's kind of like mathematics.

07:11.610 --> 07:13.680
You're never fully done with it.

07:14.970 --> 07:20.600
The more problems you solve after completing these 26 problems, just move on to any of the website.

07:20.610 --> 07:24.630
I'll just I suggest you let go and solve the dynamic programming problems.

07:24.990 --> 07:30.960
You will be able to understand them easily now, like in a more better approach, and you'll be able

07:30.960 --> 07:35.580
to like solve many problems because here you have that kind of all types of problems.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.290
It's all fun.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.340
We did well and good.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.490
And after this, let's move on to the next problem.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.050
Thank you.
