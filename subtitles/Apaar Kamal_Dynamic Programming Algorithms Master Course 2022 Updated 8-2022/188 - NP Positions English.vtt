WEBVTT

00:00.490 --> 00:00.820
Okay.

00:00.820 --> 00:04.250
So now we are in the position to define what that ANP position.

00:05.260 --> 00:05.510
Right.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.330
So what are people?

00:07.330 --> 00:07.810
Auditions.

00:08.470 --> 00:09.800
Oh, okay.

00:09.940 --> 00:10.510
Just to see.

00:13.050 --> 00:20.780
But so are people Yushchenko's the positions which are been for previously white people regions.

00:25.900 --> 00:26.950
So positions.

00:28.790 --> 00:29.390
Winning for.

00:33.640 --> 00:34.250
Previously.

00:35.130 --> 00:37.180
So that piece from your right People Edition.

00:40.930 --> 00:42.760
And secondly, water and conditions.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.100
These are called the next playable editions.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.860
What is an exclusive position?

00:48.100 --> 00:51.820
Position winning for the next player mate.

00:52.090 --> 00:53.950
The player whose chances next?

00:54.890 --> 01:00.720
Well, okay, guys, we have already discussed this part that what are winning and losing positions.

01:00.740 --> 01:02.330
So I just delayed from them.

01:02.660 --> 01:02.960
Eight.

01:03.450 --> 01:05.050
So what was a losing position?

01:05.060 --> 01:06.710
If I'm the next player?

01:06.860 --> 01:11.300
I'm the current player and I cannot make a move or I can make a move and lose.

01:11.750 --> 01:12.070
Right?

01:12.590 --> 01:15.110
So can we see that?

01:15.260 --> 01:18.080
And positions correspond to the blue.

01:19.460 --> 01:20.570
Origin's are the blue.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.090
There are winning positions for the current player that we have defined.

01:25.170 --> 01:30.760
H I'm just correlating with the above example and what people additions, the previous flavor additions.

01:33.350 --> 01:35.690
Which are losing positions.

01:37.650 --> 01:41.100
Because previously it was a position winning for the previous player.

01:41.100 --> 01:41.350
Right.

01:41.370 --> 01:43.140
So for me, it is a losing bush.

01:43.820 --> 01:51.970
Well here I am relating it of in what we have w in in its order and WAC and then we have been.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.100
Well, do not forget this.

01:55.520 --> 02:00.890
And the next tribulation, which is a winning position for the next player, and B is the previous player

02:00.890 --> 02:03.590
position, which is a winning for the previous player.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.440
So as we saw in the above part.

02:06.830 --> 02:08.120
So can we see that?

02:10.560 --> 02:10.830
Okay.

02:10.830 --> 02:15.510
Let's talk about example one that not six is a B position.

02:16.540 --> 02:16.850
Eight.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.270
And except.

02:19.670 --> 02:20.190
And what?

02:20.620 --> 02:21.250
What we have.

02:21.790 --> 02:23.800
We have a one, two, three, four, five.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.720
And then seven, eight, nine, ten, 11.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.120
And these are end positions.

02:28.210 --> 02:28.930
Winning positions.

02:28.930 --> 02:31.210
And or the next play race.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.960
It is not the tough to understand these terms now.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.590
So furthering the goals, I will be using the blue in it.

02:39.070 --> 02:45.820
It is winning and losing positions because it is less confusing then and then people additions it w

02:45.880 --> 02:46.990
for win l for lose.

02:47.590 --> 02:47.840
I.

02:48.340 --> 02:53.410
I have to tell you all of all this because it's a part of game theory eight.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.270
So you should know this pool.

02:56.260 --> 03:03.460
Now let's move forward and let's define one more position, which is a dominant position.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.530
The water terminal position.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.870
A position from which there is no move possible made.

03:14.450 --> 03:17.660
It's a position from which no legal move.

03:19.030 --> 03:19.420
Is.

03:20.100 --> 03:20.610
Possible.

03:22.520 --> 03:25.910
For example, the zero was a dominant position.

03:26.860 --> 03:27.180
Right.

03:27.750 --> 03:36.280
Well, the terminal position is a losing position, but not necessarily all losing positions are a dominant

03:36.280 --> 03:37.660
position in Greece.

03:38.200 --> 03:38.830
Think about this.

03:39.670 --> 03:39.970
Okay.

03:40.870 --> 03:42.550
Now we have defined dominant positions.

03:42.850 --> 03:44.740
So now let's write some steps.

03:45.220 --> 03:51.640
It's make some steps that we used earlier to find out all the positions.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.070
So let's say the steps of the algorithm.

03:54.100 --> 03:58.030
So the first step is we will mark.

04:00.260 --> 04:01.790
All terminal positions.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.720
As people.

04:09.950 --> 04:10.820
Oral tradition.

04:11.760 --> 04:12.060
Okay.

04:12.690 --> 04:16.650
So order to manipulations up people because we are talking about the normal route.

04:17.790 --> 04:21.060
So initially will mark autumnal editions as people editions.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.130
Now let's move on to the second step.

04:24.440 --> 04:24.680
Eight.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.630
So now we will, Mark.

04:30.390 --> 04:30.700
Okay.

04:30.960 --> 04:38.940
So we will mark all the positions that can reach any position as a end position.

04:39.620 --> 04:41.280
Eight Mark all.

04:42.370 --> 04:43.090
Positions.

04:45.920 --> 04:46.700
Which can.

04:47.790 --> 04:50.090
Reach any position.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.290
S and position eight.

04:58.870 --> 05:03.390
Initially, what we did was we marked the term liberation as a people edition and then now we're making

05:03.780 --> 05:10.920
all the positions which can move to this position or any of the People Edition's s end positions, because

05:11.250 --> 05:15.780
we know at least one People edition is required to make it desire and position eight.

05:15.810 --> 05:21.330
Similarly, at least one losing position is required to make the current position as of winning position

05:21.870 --> 05:22.170
eight.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.380
Now, what is the third?

05:24.830 --> 05:30.680
The third one was, he remarked, people should be mocked and politicians now will again make people

05:30.680 --> 05:31.100
decisions.

05:31.430 --> 05:35.030
Out of all the positions that we did, I've been stabbed to eight.

05:35.550 --> 05:36.590
What I see.

05:40.400 --> 05:40.790
Okay.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.070
So can we say a key mark?

05:43.250 --> 05:43.610
Okay.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.050
Mark all.

05:52.530 --> 05:53.520
All the positions.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.660
As a position.

06:02.550 --> 06:03.270
From which.

06:06.890 --> 06:08.180
We can only move to.

06:12.700 --> 06:13.450
And position.

06:15.260 --> 06:15.530
Right.

06:16.940 --> 06:22.220
So in all the positions as be versions from which we can move to any of the end positions derived.

06:23.780 --> 06:25.160
In step.

06:26.100 --> 06:31.560
To aid in what is a full step if no new positions are formed.

06:31.860 --> 06:32.460
No new.

06:33.580 --> 06:39.280
Positions marked, it means I perform step two, I perform step three, and I'm not getting anything

06:39.280 --> 06:40.000
new out of it.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.040
No more new additions.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.330
All the positions have been marked.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.340
If no new positions break.

06:45.880 --> 06:46.510
Otherwise.

06:49.880 --> 06:50.720
Go to step two.

06:53.860 --> 06:54.090
Right.

06:54.570 --> 06:59.370
Go to step to mark all end positions again and then mark people means again and again.

06:59.370 --> 07:00.390
Tick, embedded.

07:00.390 --> 07:01.560
I've got something new or not.

07:03.390 --> 07:09.300
So this is one way of solving this algorithm by moving backwards, moving from terminal position to

07:09.300 --> 07:10.080
the final state.

07:11.370 --> 07:11.660
Right.

07:12.710 --> 07:13.110
Okay.

07:13.130 --> 07:20.090
So this was about being in positions or w positions further in the course, I'll be like saying only

07:20.090 --> 07:21.260
W in L positions.

07:21.560 --> 07:22.940
So you don't have to worry about that.

07:23.450 --> 07:27.440
Well, whichever way it pleases, you will take your friend, whatever.

07:27.830 --> 07:31.190
But I will be using W in it, so do not get confused.

07:31.220 --> 07:33.200
W is a winning position for the current player.

07:33.830 --> 07:36.140
L is the winning version for the current player.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.200
So the L is a losing position for the current player.

07:39.530 --> 07:45.890
Okay, so let me finalize all the node rotations of.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.600
This take away Games eight.

07:49.620 --> 07:50.940
Or let me see somebody.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.120
Sources I'm reading.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.770
We got it all.

07:56.060 --> 07:57.320
Dominant positions are.

07:59.240 --> 07:59.810
Positions.

08:05.890 --> 08:06.220
Right.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.130
And from every.

08:14.330 --> 08:16.070
From every end position.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.110
We have at least.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.800
We have at least one move to be position.

08:33.300 --> 08:35.670
Well and from.

08:37.530 --> 08:38.310
People edition.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.310
Almost.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.400
Are in any position.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.080
Order to.

08:52.840 --> 08:53.910
Do it in position.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.000
Ladies.

08:57.010 --> 09:01.960
So these are the general understandings, the summary of whole concept of the degree games from which

09:01.960 --> 09:04.130
we derived all their being inputs.

09:05.650 --> 09:11.590
So subtraction game has been done, has been discussed, and big of a game has been discussed and different

09:11.590 --> 09:14.620
days of the games are discussed over here.

09:15.670 --> 09:22.570
So in the next part we will see some different varieties of games, some cool examples of take away

09:22.570 --> 09:24.160
games in the next video.

09:24.370 --> 09:24.690
Right.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.620
And then after that, we'll move on to the name game.

09:27.100 --> 09:27.430
Right.

09:27.580 --> 09:27.910
Okay.

09:27.910 --> 09:28.660
So thank you.
