WEBVTT

00:00.910 --> 00:01.220
Yep.

00:01.330 --> 00:03.220
So let's solve a very.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.290
Medium problem.

00:06.500 --> 00:09.160
Although there are some legs in this, legs in this.

00:09.170 --> 00:12.290
But I actually like this problem a lot.

00:13.010 --> 00:17.060
So this will this is kind of a very basic problem in partitioning.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.370
It is kinds of problems.

00:20.420 --> 00:21.380
Let's read this.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.690
Given an area partition the area into contiguous areas.

00:26.690 --> 00:27.550
So this is important.

00:27.870 --> 00:29.510
Now we have contiguous of areas.

00:29.930 --> 00:34.150
That means if one partition finishes, the second partition starts, right.

00:34.580 --> 00:38.090
So every element now has only two choices, not three.

00:38.420 --> 00:40.100
I like the previous problem.

00:40.460 --> 00:42.020
The choices are there.

00:43.100 --> 00:46.190
They will be, but they have only two choices.

00:46.460 --> 00:47.150
They have to be.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.550
So not only one choice.

00:48.580 --> 00:48.860
Sorry.

00:49.100 --> 00:54.320
Yeah, that is, they have to be in the same area as the partisans.

00:54.890 --> 00:55.550
No other choice.

00:57.200 --> 00:57.490
Yeah.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.620
So he'd say, Is this a marriage of land that most key?

01:00.080 --> 01:03.470
Basically the politicians are use is now defining the politicians.

01:03.470 --> 01:06.620
I should be at most key after partitioning it.

01:06.630 --> 01:07.130
So very.

01:07.130 --> 01:11.620
Has their values changed to become the maximum value of the somebody?

01:12.350 --> 01:16.910
So if I'm making a partition or whatever the maximum value of that partition, that is the new value

01:16.910 --> 01:17.210
now.

01:17.750 --> 01:23.540
And each value will change in that partition, whatever the whatever the values are there, that will

01:23.540 --> 01:25.520
change the maximum value of that partition.

01:26.120 --> 01:30.530
Eight And now what we will do is we are a larger sum of the given that after partitioning.

01:31.590 --> 01:31.820
They?

01:32.940 --> 01:34.980
This is a very easy problem, though.

01:34.980 --> 01:39.540
It's not that if you think about the approach that I shared with you, there is think about starting

01:39.540 --> 01:43.860
from first and think about making partitions and you made a partition.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.930
Ask for the rest of the area.

01:46.230 --> 01:52.740
It now make partitions like eight and the only condition here is to make a partition is that gates equals

01:52.740 --> 01:56.730
four, three or three, that the length of that partition should be equal.

01:56.730 --> 02:00.990
Look, for example, in the first input what we have, we have gaikwad for three.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.130
That means.

02:03.550 --> 02:10.660
If I start from the first or I can have at most a brilliant summary and three land partition or two

02:10.660 --> 02:12.370
land partition or one land partition.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.170
I cannot have fallen partition.

02:14.830 --> 02:20.260
So if I have trillion so this is the best answer of 15, then nine and then ten ending eight.

02:20.500 --> 02:26.700
The partitions are one, two, seven, nine alone and two two, ten, eight.

02:26.710 --> 02:28.300
So what's the sum of the whole array?

02:28.330 --> 02:29.590
It is nothing related for.

02:30.480 --> 02:35.760
Similarly for the next city, we have to partition it such a way that we get the maximum sum.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.250
So I hope you understood the problem.

02:38.250 --> 02:41.850
And it has a very it is a very pretty deep problem.

02:42.360 --> 02:46.530
I would just suggest you that don't watch this video and just move ahead.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.370
Like solve this problem yourself.

02:50.110 --> 02:50.330
Okay.

02:50.660 --> 02:54.170
So what we will say will start from the API Gamma.

02:56.530 --> 02:58.260
Unity or do we need.

02:58.260 --> 02:58.560
Okay.

02:58.990 --> 02:59.470
Yeah, let's see.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.880
We don't need care in this state.

03:00.880 --> 03:01.900
We just need DPA.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.120
That means it is a voluntary solution.

03:04.120 --> 03:04.410
Right.

03:05.350 --> 03:11.140
So what I want is to be able just tell me what's the answer for the added?

03:11.140 --> 03:14.070
That aside from Index II, the answer was obvious.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.960
A relative answer for suffix Eddie.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.770
It starts from.

03:23.550 --> 03:24.390
And what I'll do is.

03:24.390 --> 03:24.870
I'll just.

03:27.150 --> 03:27.960
Nothing much, right?

03:28.080 --> 03:30.090
So if I'm starting from index, I.

03:30.230 --> 03:31.470
I'll just run a loop.

03:32.700 --> 03:36.360
And then we'll start from and go till I bless.

03:38.190 --> 03:38.730
Minus one.

03:39.790 --> 03:42.940
Eight five because the partisan can be Ed Muskie.

03:43.180 --> 03:48.880
It's I'm saying the DPA means start a partisan, get on my own and tell me what's the best answer about

03:48.880 --> 03:49.140
the whole.

03:50.350 --> 03:51.460
I just run a loop.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.640
That is a day loop which will go its start from.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.750
I and God labels.

03:57.790 --> 04:06.180
Labels when I simply say that BPA is nothing but is equal to a maximum of whatever BP plus one gets

04:06.180 --> 04:08.430
because not just man of their partition rate.

04:08.460 --> 04:10.140
So I have this partition from my do.

04:11.100 --> 04:15.480
So if the partition is from, I do the next partition start from J plus one.

04:15.480 --> 04:19.410
That means don't give me the best answer for the remaining area of the parties and start from the placement

04:19.890 --> 04:20.250
less.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.090
When I'm running the loop, I'll just keep that.

04:23.300 --> 04:28.170
I just keep a value of the maximum element when I'm starting from ideology, right?

04:28.500 --> 04:31.440
And whatever is the maximum element, I just simply multiply.

04:33.550 --> 04:38.350
It didn't do the the number of elements that have already taken, which is J minus A-minus.

04:41.210 --> 04:42.790
Late Autumn.

04:43.460 --> 04:43.760
Yeah.

04:43.850 --> 04:49.120
Do anything Wednesday and we'll get the maximum on all of them.

04:49.130 --> 04:53.360
So it's just making them partisan, asking the answer for the remaining area and for this partition.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.520
Just calculating my own answers.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.560
Nothing that of.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.340
8 minutes of.

05:00.570 --> 05:04.470
It's Gordon in the next part, or let's call it in this part only.

05:04.890 --> 05:06.630
It's a pretty easy problem.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.640
Well, let me very quickly go to.

05:17.670 --> 05:18.840
Have a solution.

05:19.970 --> 05:21.610
And we'll just this out.

05:21.650 --> 05:22.550
Make some.

05:24.670 --> 05:26.320
Auditioning for this.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.490
I just need a vector.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.660
It's liberating because we have to run a case.

05:32.840 --> 05:33.920
Let me copy this.

05:35.750 --> 05:40.160
Right religious policy and just Basque equal to three.

05:42.890 --> 05:46.520
So it will do nothing, but it will definitely be of something.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.350
And in the deep, what I have is.

05:48.350 --> 05:48.950
I have.

05:51.430 --> 05:53.500
I because that's the.

05:54.530 --> 05:57.550
Stated, I have and what values do I need?

05:57.560 --> 05:59.240
I need this at a.

06:00.090 --> 06:01.200
Make me copy it.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.110
Let's copy them.

06:03.110 --> 06:03.470
But.

06:04.940 --> 06:09.340
Although I don't need this guy, what I can do is, you know, even I don't need this area.

06:09.380 --> 06:11.560
I can just initialize them globally over there.

06:12.350 --> 06:13.200
Let's just keep them.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.250
We want more memories on the basis of them because they won't change.

06:17.550 --> 06:19.100
So these are the three things that I need.

06:19.190 --> 06:22.880
So what I'll do is I will start from zero.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.710
It is as it is and it is as it as it ain't.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.840
And finally, it's my answer.

06:30.380 --> 06:31.900
So let's initially answer is zero.

06:31.910 --> 06:33.830
Do the error have negative numbers?

06:34.490 --> 06:34.820
No.

06:34.970 --> 06:37.040
Only possible answer is zero.

06:37.580 --> 06:45.080
It start from j will start from the equals two way because one partition can be the third number on

06:45.080 --> 06:45.200
it.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.740
Eight J will go tell other it is.

06:48.740 --> 06:54.200
It will be less than added size because it can cannot be any partition greater than that.

06:54.750 --> 06:55.010
Right.

06:55.410 --> 06:57.440
Or let's take minimum of.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.720
This or the second condition.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.740
That means the parties in that land can at most we get eight.

07:04.890 --> 07:07.590
So it will be less than, let's say, j.

07:08.190 --> 07:10.080
A-plus e.

07:11.040 --> 07:17.100
Eight so that's what they will go and do they didn't me the end of the partition that I had started

07:17.700 --> 07:22.680
answering zero let me take maximum value to be equal to you know so whenever I move forward I just see

07:22.980 --> 07:24.830
this update the max eight.

07:24.900 --> 07:31.320
I'll tell you there's nothing written maxim of this and edit it whatever the maximum value I just included

07:31.320 --> 07:31.800
into my.

07:33.070 --> 07:33.340
And.

07:34.510 --> 07:42.220
So if I made this party to do my duty, what is the total sum of the maximal way to?

07:42.280 --> 07:46.960
Basically, there's a max value that is in this partition that is stored in this particular variable

07:47.380 --> 07:52.410
and that max value will be included in my some how many number of times between you and I.

07:52.450 --> 07:54.280
So I'll simply say Max.

07:55.380 --> 07:57.510
In two day minus eight plus one.

07:58.650 --> 07:59.010
Correct.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.590
And because the tail end of the mobile isn't right now.

08:02.370 --> 08:06.750
And now the second thing is, if I made this partition, this is the cost.

08:06.810 --> 08:08.130
This is the sum that I'm getting.

08:08.590 --> 08:13.170
Just tell me what's the best answer from DPD place when this bus, Eddie.

08:13.170 --> 08:14.420
And is this bus key?

08:15.480 --> 08:21.900
Well, there's only one variable that's changing, which is I that is the states of A.P., not that

08:22.320 --> 08:22.680
heavy.

08:23.810 --> 08:24.870
So it had an answer.

08:24.870 --> 08:27.120
And when I reached the end.

08:28.380 --> 08:28.950
That means.

08:28.950 --> 08:29.320
Sorry.

08:29.970 --> 08:32.220
And I reached the end of it.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.450
I just simply written zero.

08:34.490 --> 08:35.240
I'm bewildered.

08:36.450 --> 08:36.810
Okay.

08:36.820 --> 08:37.110
Moment.

08:37.110 --> 08:38.610
Union de Gaulle men.

08:42.030 --> 08:42.660
Okay.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.330
Maybe it is saying it because.

08:48.160 --> 08:48.870
Dave Buster's.

08:49.410 --> 08:53.460
Because this is a different return type and this is important, right?

08:54.540 --> 08:56.040
Could you finally what?

08:56.040 --> 08:56.440
I lose.

08:56.460 --> 08:57.060
Okay, I'm not.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.260
See out over here.

09:01.530 --> 09:05.850
And in this case, what I will do is.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.640
Mr. Bass, kiss my bed.

09:10.130 --> 09:10.580
Either.

09:10.580 --> 09:17.330
It's either ten zero eight or as you can see, we have it before and we'll simply memorize it.

09:17.330 --> 09:18.950
Let's memorize it very quickly.

09:23.420 --> 09:27.740
Read and read more Dart Beaks.

09:28.900 --> 09:34.300
And in that space, I'm a minus X plus minus one do.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.670
And I simply say if.

09:37.950 --> 09:44.220
Memo I will is not equal to minus one written he else.

09:45.290 --> 09:46.430
We'll just return.

09:47.540 --> 09:48.170
The Spirit.

09:50.850 --> 09:54.030
I think that works and thank you, Aaron for watching.

09:54.030 --> 09:56.670
Will move on to some very good next problems.

09:57.060 --> 09:57.420
Thanks.
