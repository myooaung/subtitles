WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:02.970
Log base to two E.

00:04.400 --> 00:04.850
Five.

00:05.540 --> 00:05.900
Correct.

00:08.950 --> 00:13.380
So yeah, it is 717 points, 609, six and eight.

00:13.480 --> 00:19.660
If I want to make a ceiling of reading the existing one above, it will be 18 eight and I want to store

00:19.660 --> 00:21.310
to days to the power 18th pairing.

00:21.310 --> 00:26.740
So basically the array should be of size 19 overall like to take an extra.

00:28.120 --> 00:32.050
We can take 19 Advil or just take my next award.

00:32.050 --> 00:32.500
I can do it.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.910
I can take 28.

00:33.910 --> 00:36.220
So it doesn't matter to 19 or 28.

00:36.220 --> 00:38.740
But what I do is I just take plus one.

00:39.360 --> 00:43.720
So I hope you understood this that we can do that.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.970
The the number of pairings for any of the note.

00:47.980 --> 00:50.230
We want to write it in only eight.

00:50.230 --> 00:55.600
So we only wanted to race to the power one to the receive of our to do this about three and so on.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.030
Written is divided into parent nothing more than that.

00:58.660 --> 01:00.250
And now we'll see why we want it.

01:00.250 --> 01:01.270
Right now.

01:01.270 --> 01:04.780
You all know any number can it can be written as a binary number.

01:06.690 --> 01:10.350
It means every number has a binary representation.

01:11.070 --> 01:13.050
It will use that part here.

01:13.820 --> 01:17.220
So let's say I want to find X's of 17th period.

01:17.820 --> 01:24.570
What I'll do is I'll directly say okay, from an index, go to its 16th period, which is not a thing

01:24.570 --> 01:25.320
but x.

01:26.910 --> 01:31.470
You raise the bar for spirit that I I've already stored and calculated how you calculated will I'll

01:31.470 --> 01:35.430
explain that later, but I don't understand the use case of it.

01:36.330 --> 01:40.500
And let's say I approached x dash which was x 16 period.

01:40.500 --> 01:45.550
Now what I want to do is I want to go to it by speed there just to raise to power dude parent.

01:45.840 --> 01:52.770
This X double is basically for x x double that will be its 17th period because seven is an x six plus

01:52.770 --> 01:52.950
one.

01:53.550 --> 01:57.360
Similarly, if I want to find a 10th period for ten, is it another plus two.

01:57.720 --> 02:02.670
What I'll do is I'll go to it's eight period and then I'll go to its second period.

02:04.050 --> 02:04.410
Correct.

02:05.130 --> 02:07.350
So it's prudent and that's second vision.

02:07.350 --> 02:12.840
And we all we all know we all have already stored these values because all these are powers of two.

02:13.380 --> 02:21.480
And if I want to find out, for example, 31st parent, I what I can do is Promax Woodward's 16th period,

02:22.140 --> 02:23.340
let's call it x days.

02:23.340 --> 02:26.100
Then from x days go to it it parent.

02:27.850 --> 02:29.890
Then go to its fourth parent.

02:31.260 --> 02:31.960
Then go to it.

02:32.700 --> 02:33.570
Second parent.

02:35.110 --> 02:36.160
And then go to it.

02:37.540 --> 02:40.510
Let's call it extra bullish and then go to its first period.

02:43.010 --> 02:44.990
Eight and it's called x four.

02:46.030 --> 02:53.060
Well, now you can see from a particular x, I went to six plus eight plus four plus two, 30 plus one.

02:54.990 --> 03:02.520
31st, they took in just one, two, three, four, five in just five steps in this five iterations

03:02.520 --> 03:05.640
I reached its 31st period.

03:06.240 --> 03:12.540
So you can easily see that for any number which is key and case less than two if even greater than equal

03:12.540 --> 03:14.130
to one eight.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.550
In a for any number.

03:16.570 --> 03:20.420
What I can do is I can divide it into it's binary form, right?

03:20.430 --> 03:25.480
And in binary form we can see we have at most log base to win all log base to get.

03:26.620 --> 03:27.100
Phipps.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.930
They always took steps.

03:28.930 --> 03:30.550
I can answer every query.

03:31.450 --> 03:31.730
Correct.

03:32.870 --> 03:37.010
And one along with two steps in this it is nothing but 28.

03:37.250 --> 03:42.080
So for any of the values, the queries will be answered in just friendly steps.

03:43.220 --> 03:45.380
Well, because I'm taking 20 to be the upper limit.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.720
I hope this part is very clear.

03:47.720 --> 03:47.990
Right?

03:48.440 --> 03:50.810
Like what is the use of finding out?

03:50.810 --> 03:53.250
They do it if to keep our eye independent of any trade.

03:53.660 --> 03:57.200
Now let's figure out how to find out to restore the power our youth patent.

04:00.370 --> 04:06.100
I wonder if I know to refer to the power I experience for any node or let's say let's call it to this

04:06.100 --> 04:09.340
to the power git parent for any Iot node.

04:09.940 --> 04:10.840
Let's call it this.

04:12.040 --> 04:12.280
Well.

04:14.090 --> 04:15.950
So if I want to find out.

04:16.340 --> 04:17.980
Okay, so let's start from the base case.

04:17.990 --> 04:18.920
So it's a base case.

04:19.880 --> 04:20.440
What any.

04:20.440 --> 04:26.990
I find it to restore power due to parent which is nothing but FGF i.e. gamma one which is nothing but

04:26.990 --> 04:27.650
its parent.

04:28.160 --> 04:33.830
The parent that I'm passing in the whenever I perform or DFS in the tree I possibly didn't rate the

04:33.840 --> 04:35.240
that is the base case.

04:35.690 --> 04:40.460
Now let's talk about if I go to comma one, which is nothing but f of.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.960
I go to the how can I find note?

04:46.220 --> 04:48.990
For any I want to find out second billing.

04:49.010 --> 04:53.180
So and I recursively do something so that I can easily find out the.

04:55.510 --> 05:02.980
I had its second look and see that its second parent is equal to nothing but its first parents frustrated.

05:03.970 --> 05:04.270
Eight.

05:04.670 --> 05:11.170
So basically what I want to say is this is he goes to F off its first variant, which is i.e. Gamma

05:11.320 --> 05:11.800
one.

05:15.010 --> 05:15.460
Okay.

05:16.240 --> 05:16.570
Yeah.

05:16.630 --> 05:18.970
So it is the here you can see it is.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.320
I go my one but do not get confused.

05:21.320 --> 05:27.120
Straight ahead it means find out eyes to raise to the zeroth parent trait.

05:27.500 --> 05:32.210
In this case, what I do is instead of to this to power zero, let me just place from zero and one over

05:32.210 --> 05:32.470
there.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.890
This will indirectly mean to this above one and into this zero so that we don't get confused.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.110
Eight And now.

05:39.630 --> 05:39.960
Yeah.

05:40.290 --> 05:43.200
So this is nothing but I's liquidated.

05:43.320 --> 05:43.800
It is.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.110
Let's call it Bering Strait.

05:46.530 --> 05:47.810
This is ice for spring.

05:47.820 --> 05:48.570
This is ice.

05:48.690 --> 05:56.370
Second parent that sort of I come to one means because I have over one means are liquidated eyes do

05:56.430 --> 05:57.360
this to the power.

05:58.910 --> 05:59.680
Jeered, spitting.

06:01.890 --> 06:08.010
If I want to find out what is is that kingpin then can I use something recursively?

06:08.010 --> 06:09.930
I can simply say find out who is.

06:10.950 --> 06:13.050
Our tourist is about fourth of what?

06:13.440 --> 06:16.450
Find out who it is the first reading and find out.

06:16.470 --> 06:18.470
It's frustrating because we've already calculated it.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.380
That's how it works.

06:20.040 --> 06:26.730
What I'll be doing is whenever we perform a DFS, we'll be calculating these days to the power G appearing

06:26.730 --> 06:28.980
for all the notes whenever we are coming down.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.770
Eight So we are just calculating from top.

06:31.770 --> 06:38.080
That means for any Nordics, all its ancestors to raise to the power g parent is already filled in.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.290
We are already calculating it and storing it somewhere.

06:41.070 --> 06:41.330
So.

06:42.220 --> 06:43.630
What can I say?

06:43.660 --> 06:45.160
It is parents.

06:46.280 --> 06:46.730
Parent.

06:47.990 --> 06:48.240
Right.

06:48.650 --> 06:50.510
And how how can I not be an independent?

06:50.510 --> 06:58.070
I can simply say it is nothing but f I yeah, it is nothing but f f f off i comma.

06:59.180 --> 07:00.530
Zero zero.

07:00.980 --> 07:01.820
What does it mean?

07:02.210 --> 07:02.690
Let me.

07:05.080 --> 07:05.860
It means nothing.

07:05.910 --> 07:07.240
But what if I go zero?

07:07.360 --> 07:08.520
I've already calculated it.

07:08.530 --> 07:10.510
It is nothing but its parent eight.

07:10.660 --> 07:12.690
So it's parent zero.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.570
That means.

07:14.050 --> 07:17.090
What is zero eight is to this is above the you remember it is if eight.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.570
So it is to receive over zero, which is one.

07:19.870 --> 07:23.140
So I can see f of parent zero, which is nothing but parent of.

07:24.480 --> 07:28.740
Income of one aide to Survivor zero is one that means.

07:30.220 --> 07:33.970
Find me who is the parent of the first parent of the parent?

07:34.520 --> 07:41.110
I think if I want to write something recursively, if I want to find out later, I might to that I will

07:41.110 --> 07:48.400
directly right to this f of f i comma 118 because you need to do power to candidate and they have to

07:48.400 --> 07:49.720
raise about one and two.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.450
This is about one, correct.

07:52.960 --> 07:58.330
What I'll simply say is if I want to find its fourth parent, then we already know what is it?

07:59.320 --> 08:02.170
Second parent order to convert and find notice.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.450
Second parent but any.

08:05.790 --> 08:06.280
Range.

08:06.330 --> 08:07.270
That is it.

08:07.290 --> 08:08.470
Let's see if I have it.

08:08.490 --> 08:09.630
It can be Dennis.

08:09.630 --> 08:10.430
Four plus four.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.750
I already knew what it's for.

08:12.750 --> 08:18.000
Speeding, because I'm calculating that I will just say I know it's fourth period.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.800
And tell me, what was it for?

08:19.800 --> 08:20.220
Speeding.

08:20.650 --> 08:23.460
That will be the current guys interpreting it.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.390
So I'm.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.730
I'm actually using binary lifting, right?

08:26.730 --> 08:32.580
I'm lifting it in binary by dividing it by two rates of what I need is let's see if I want to find out

08:32.580 --> 08:35.760
the current node six parent I take by nodes.

08:35.760 --> 08:41.070
It's been in because I've already found it out because that's that's how I'm calculating it right before

08:41.070 --> 08:46.860
any to restore power date parent I simply say find out two days to do power J minus one to parent and

08:46.860 --> 08:48.090
for that give me.

08:49.210 --> 08:49.600
It's.

08:50.870 --> 08:52.070
J minus one parent.

08:53.540 --> 08:54.410
As simple as that.

08:54.740 --> 08:55.030
Right.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.790
So it might be a little confusing, but let me give you an example.

08:59.870 --> 09:05.780
Let me take that Jane example that we discussed, because from there, it will become a lot clearer.

09:08.050 --> 09:08.380
Yeah.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.910
Let me cool.

09:10.360 --> 09:13.810
So, as I said, I'll be starting from one and I'll keep feeling the values.

09:13.820 --> 09:14.040
Right?

09:14.390 --> 09:15.610
Let's say the values are.

09:15.610 --> 09:18.040
I want to find out what is first

09:18.370 --> 09:24.040
f10f11f12.

09:24.340 --> 09:28.690
It's a these are the values that I want to find out and say f one, three.

09:29.970 --> 09:38.940
Similarly for to what I wanted, I want to find out F2 zero, F2 one, F2 two and F2 three.

09:39.270 --> 09:40.980
It's firstly let's find out these values.

09:41.760 --> 09:42.090
So.

09:43.250 --> 09:43.550
Yeah.

09:43.860 --> 09:44.810
What is that, one zero.

09:44.840 --> 09:48.190
What is the first variant of one?

09:48.200 --> 09:49.010
It is minus one.

09:49.330 --> 09:50.570
We already seen this will pass.

09:50.570 --> 09:52.170
Minus one is debating it.

09:52.370 --> 09:57.590
So I'm afraid nobody here in the DFS and I'm calculating first and then performing their deficit eight.

09:58.190 --> 10:04.640
So what is that one when it is once tourist is about 1 billion which is nothing but already have difficulties

10:04.640 --> 10:06.860
in it because of relation were eliminated.

10:07.190 --> 10:11.000
I come my dear, is nothing but f of f off.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.170
I call my g minus one j minus.

10:15.590 --> 10:15.810
Yeah.

10:16.340 --> 10:17.660
So why does it seem.

10:18.530 --> 10:22.880
One one will be nothing but f off one comma zero, which is minus one.

10:22.970 --> 10:23.810
Okay, let me write it.

10:24.110 --> 10:30.430
F off f of one comma zero zero which is nothing but f of oh.

10:30.500 --> 10:36.110
What is bungoma zero for this current if it is nothing but minus one, we already found it out.

10:36.410 --> 10:37.070
And what is it?

10:37.190 --> 10:37.460
Zero.

10:37.520 --> 10:38.030
Bearing that thing.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.210
Word minus for it.

10:39.350 --> 10:44.570
So whenever we have this minus one thing in the picture, we'll just write minus one over here.

10:45.140 --> 10:45.420
Eight.

10:46.470 --> 10:48.180
Now let's talk about one of two.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.090
This will also be minus one and this will also be minus eight.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.530
Now, what about F2 zero?

10:52.980 --> 10:56.220
That means the first breeding of two, which is nothing but one that we already know.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.030
It's a base case.

10:57.540 --> 11:06.000
And number two, the 421 of 211 is nothing but F of F of two gamma 008, which is F of what is to a

11:06.000 --> 11:06.480
gamma zero.

11:06.480 --> 11:10.890
It is one we will we have already found this out and it's zero three.

11:10.980 --> 11:12.450
So what is that for one comma zero.

11:12.690 --> 11:15.210
It is already over there, which is minus one.

11:16.170 --> 11:21.600
So we can see the second parent of two is minus one because it is two.

11:21.630 --> 11:26.820
Those two races about was related about 1 billion, which is nothing with its second bit.

11:27.660 --> 11:30.270
Similarly, this will be minus one and this will also be minus one.

11:31.170 --> 11:32.310
So similar same thing.

11:32.310 --> 11:36.030
You can fill four, three, four, four, four, four, four, five, eight, eight.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.520
Because for any node.

11:38.520 --> 11:39.630
For any I.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.050
Well, Margie, I need two things.

11:43.950 --> 11:44.880
The first thing is.

11:46.020 --> 11:53.040
F I got my D-minus one that means what is its good is power do minus one feeling that is over here.

11:53.790 --> 11:54.090
Right?

11:54.450 --> 11:57.840
And that will be somewhere above eight.

11:58.290 --> 12:01.860
That will be somewhere above in the ancestry ordered will be minus eight.

12:02.040 --> 12:08.970
So if it is somewhere above in the ancestry or even if it is minus one for that value, what we want,

12:08.970 --> 12:11.550
we want F off D minus one.

12:11.880 --> 12:18.990
And this value will or will already have been calculated because we are performing a DFS from top to

12:18.990 --> 12:19.370
bottom.

12:19.380 --> 12:22.200
Later we start or d if as from the root naught and keep filling the values.

12:23.090 --> 12:23.360
Eight.

12:24.250 --> 12:25.390
Before any of aphasia.

12:25.390 --> 12:28.720
I wonder if if I go to you my concern, which is fear, because we are feeling it.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.490
We will feel that very ah.

12:31.510 --> 12:36.070
If if you don't understand the bottom of approach, then what you can do is you can try the top down

12:36.070 --> 12:41.050
approach, you can call it recursively also, but I'll be filling it with a table because that's not

12:41.050 --> 12:43.990
easy to understand it so soon.

12:43.990 --> 12:44.860
The next part, everyone.

12:44.860 --> 12:45.610
And let's call it.
