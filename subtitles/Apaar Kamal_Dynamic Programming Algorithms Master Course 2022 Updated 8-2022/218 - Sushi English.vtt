WEBVTT

00:01.530 --> 00:01.860
Yeah.

00:01.920 --> 00:05.190
So welcome to the next problem set, which is E.

00:06.380 --> 00:14.410
And so she's a dish of course and they sit and dishes number one two in initially for each i.e. dish

00:14.420 --> 00:22.640
i.e. has a it is either one, two or three pieces of she on it are you will perform the following operations

00:22.640 --> 00:29.150
repeatedly and then all the pieces of sushi are you didn't really die then choose the numbers are going

00:29.160 --> 00:32.810
to end with equal probabilities and let it be the outcome.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.370
If there are some pieces of sushi on dish, I eat to one of them.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.170
If there is nothing, do nothing.

00:40.010 --> 00:45.320
It will find an expected number of times the operation is performed before all the pieces of sushi are

00:45.380 --> 00:45.830
eaten.

00:46.490 --> 00:53.010
These kind of problems are a little tricky, which involves us to find the expected number of times.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.920
The expectation value, basically.

00:55.810 --> 00:56.650
Go for this.

00:56.950 --> 00:58.420
Firstly, I would suggest you do.

00:59.410 --> 01:05.290
And head on to Google and find out what this expectation means if you are not aware of it.

01:05.950 --> 01:06.230
Eight.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.840
But most of us are aware of it.

01:07.870 --> 01:10.990
Of course, we have already factored in plurality and statistics.

01:11.530 --> 01:17.050
So let me quickly give you an explanation and a definition of expected values.

01:17.780 --> 01:22.660
And then we also show you why is expected value not a genuine thing?

01:24.660 --> 01:25.140
So.

01:26.840 --> 01:27.140
Yes.

01:27.890 --> 01:30.290
I wasn't expecting value of any.

01:31.980 --> 01:35.640
Event X, so it is actually VFX into.

01:36.030 --> 01:41.660
So basically it's take the summation of the plurality of happening of the division into the event itself

01:41.970 --> 01:44.320
to be X into x eight.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.040
So what is expectation value?

01:47.460 --> 01:49.170
So this is in terms of real numbers, right.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.010
And into.

01:51.830 --> 01:56.180
Be accessible won't be into exit the number eight or in the real values.

01:56.180 --> 02:02.150
What we see is that the expectation value of any index is being to be X, which is the plurality of

02:02.150 --> 02:02.270
it.

02:02.270 --> 02:03.530
Index it.

02:05.310 --> 02:05.790
Basically.

02:07.100 --> 02:10.280
Well, but this is not what it actually is.

02:10.310 --> 02:12.290
So let me give you a quick example of it.

02:14.010 --> 02:15.400
What is example behind this?

02:15.420 --> 02:15.810
It is.

02:16.050 --> 02:18.660
Let's say I'm ruling a dying guy has six faces.

02:19.220 --> 02:20.820
So what is expected?

02:22.010 --> 02:25.430
What is expected outcome of their day, right?

02:25.850 --> 02:27.830
What is expected outcome of their diet?

02:28.490 --> 02:29.020
Here we have.

02:29.330 --> 02:31.400
So what are the possible outcomes, guys?

02:31.730 --> 02:36.260
And then I can have one, two, three, four, five or six, eight.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.170
So one with the plurality of one by six plus two.

02:39.440 --> 02:44.600
So when you play those two with the variety of one by six plus three, with the video one by six plus

02:44.600 --> 02:48.950
four, with a variety of one by six plus five with the birdie one by six plus six with the video of

02:49.340 --> 02:49.960
one by six.

02:49.960 --> 02:53.930
So all of them have equal ratings as of now because it's an unbiased going.

02:55.260 --> 02:59.060
What we had here is one plus two plus three plus four plus five plus six.

03:00.050 --> 03:00.380
Right.

03:01.730 --> 03:03.130
Which is equal to how much?

03:03.140 --> 03:03.800
11.

03:04.840 --> 03:05.060
Okay.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.150
The six explosive were two.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.080
It is kind of.

03:10.540 --> 03:15.010
One divided by six, which is 3.50 delegates.

03:15.130 --> 03:21.160
And 3.5 I would be expected through and someone through a 3.5.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.600
Boys not age.

03:24.630 --> 03:30.540
So this is what mathematics expectation means that what is the expected value of anything?

03:30.630 --> 03:35.820
It is equal to the probability of all the events into the event itself.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.910
It is taking it with the event and adding all of them.

03:39.990 --> 03:41.640
It's a property of all the events.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.080
And then they're taking their.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.850
Permissions always.

03:47.280 --> 03:52.650
This is a normal introduction to expectations and there are many expected and many problems expectation

03:52.650 --> 03:53.850
and they are quite tricky.

03:54.390 --> 03:59.280
I would like to this year to kind of head out to this was a blog that I read.

03:59.340 --> 04:05.640
It was from Eric Took on code forces and you just move on to that and try solving those problems.

04:06.070 --> 04:08.520
So I think he had me two blocks on there and just funds.

04:10.330 --> 04:10.670
So.

04:11.800 --> 04:12.040
Yeah.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.460
But what we have in this problem, we have three types of sushi.

04:15.460 --> 04:17.230
A two A's from 1 to 3 only.

04:17.830 --> 04:18.280
And.

04:19.630 --> 04:24.670
What the guy can do is he just rules the night and from when do any get to random number, which is

04:24.670 --> 04:25.180
an index?

04:25.570 --> 04:28.570
From that index, he picks up the sushi Everest.

04:30.390 --> 04:34.860
If it is a good strategy, then it becomes a good story to hear because of untrue shooting.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.420
Or if it is zero, it doesn't move.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.810
If it is true, it becomes one.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.040
If it is one, it becomes zero eight.

04:41.370 --> 04:43.260
We picks exactly 1204 it.

04:45.290 --> 04:48.470
So for example, in this one, one, one, let's talk about this.

04:48.500 --> 04:53.720
So the expected number of operations before the first piece of sushi is eaten is one after the index

04:53.720 --> 04:55.790
next victim of an operation before the second trashes it.

04:55.790 --> 04:58.910
And it's 1.5 after the next victim number operation.

04:58.910 --> 04:59.600
We will touch her.

04:59.600 --> 05:06.080
She is eaten is the eight who does the expected operation is is 5.5.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.960
So let me give you another way of thinking this problem.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.910
What we will say is we have.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.580
We have four types of shoes, right?

05:16.430 --> 05:19.210
Let's say these represents the count of these swooshes.

05:19.220 --> 05:21.830
So we have z0e.

05:22.700 --> 05:25.520
Okay, let me write full values, which is zero one, two, three.

05:26.560 --> 05:31.620
Let's say I have some zero number of hashes, one number of sushi's do, number of sushi's and three

05:31.620 --> 05:32.950
number of sushi eight.

05:33.030 --> 05:38.820
So before this, we have some observations to make it no matter what is the order of the sushi.

05:38.940 --> 05:39.240
There it is.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.260
One, two or two, one.

05:40.650 --> 05:41.430
It doesn't matter.

05:42.210 --> 05:44.160
The order of the sushi does not matter.

05:44.580 --> 05:47.220
Hey, if I have this.

05:48.670 --> 05:49.300
Or they call it.

05:49.780 --> 05:50.050
Yeah.

05:50.560 --> 05:55.960
If I have vendors and dishes and their orders are like by muted, it doesn't matter.

05:56.230 --> 06:02.530
The answer won't change anything because everything is will equal programming and things will go.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.000
That was one of the observation to me.

06:04.030 --> 06:09.640
So now let's say we have these three types of shows zero, one, two and three.

06:11.020 --> 06:11.560
They so.

06:13.310 --> 06:18.830
What is zero zero is the total number of species which are of dishes which have zero dishes.

06:19.250 --> 06:24.860
When is it a rhythm of dishes with bunches to the total number of dishes with two associates and 302

06:24.870 --> 06:26.840
number of dishes with dishwashers?

06:26.840 --> 06:27.140
Eight.

06:27.560 --> 06:33.320
So what we'll do is we will see what is expected of 012 and.

06:34.250 --> 06:34.930
These are issues.

06:35.740 --> 06:38.470
If I have these many shoes and what is expected?

06:38.470 --> 06:39.460
Well, if I can find out.

06:39.460 --> 06:43.090
Right, this will be equal to one less.

06:43.090 --> 06:44.640
Why am I taking this one case?

06:44.890 --> 06:46.040
Because I am making a move.

06:46.060 --> 06:51.760
So whenever you make a move, you have to include that moving your expected value because you are making

06:51.760 --> 06:52.060
a move.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.860
I am making a move.

06:53.860 --> 06:58.480
And then what else is give me the expected values for other states for which I can go to.

06:58.480 --> 06:58.780
Right.

06:59.110 --> 06:59.470
So.

07:00.590 --> 07:02.010
If they do this on the new lane.

07:02.120 --> 07:02.930
So it is one.

07:03.950 --> 07:06.050
What is the other states on which I can go?

07:06.290 --> 07:13.450
I can go to a state that means, let's say I, I randomly threw a day and it gave me an 000.

07:13.550 --> 07:16.040
It basically gave me an index which has zero issue on it.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.930
It is probability of zero.

07:18.560 --> 07:25.970
It means the probability such that I'm on one of the indexes which has zero to shoot into AP.

07:27.190 --> 07:28.030
Zero as it is.

07:28.030 --> 07:34.570
Because if I pick because if I'm on a zero sushi dish, I cannot make any sushi at eight because there

07:34.570 --> 07:35.620
isn't any to pick.

07:36.670 --> 07:37.690
012, three.

07:40.630 --> 07:41.980
Probability of one.

07:43.410 --> 07:45.560
If I'm picking one sushi and it becomes.

07:46.500 --> 07:46.830
Okay.

07:47.130 --> 07:53.370
Not putting it this way that if if I have just picking up one degree from any one of their dishes,

07:53.880 --> 08:01.800
what happens is the count of dishes with one reduces by one and the count of sushi with zero increased

08:01.800 --> 08:02.160
by one.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.670
Similarly, two in three remains the same.

08:06.990 --> 08:07.170
Why?

08:07.260 --> 08:15.540
Because let's say I had this 102 and I picked up this number two zero, so it becomes 0020, had one

08:15.540 --> 08:17.410
sushi, now zero had sushi.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.890
So there are two species which do not have any.

08:20.230 --> 08:26.150
So there are two dishes which do not have any pushing them to the count of zero increases and one decreasing.

08:26.660 --> 08:29.490
So that's what we do rate when we find expected values.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.400
What we do is we take the probability into the event itself.

08:32.790 --> 08:34.020
It be a XY.

08:35.570 --> 08:37.550
And what's the third one we have?

08:38.820 --> 08:41.790
Royalty of two in the deep of.

08:43.380 --> 08:52.960
Zero as it is one plus one, because we are picking up one tissue from each containing two sources very

08:53.040 --> 08:53.730
similarly.

08:53.760 --> 09:00.360
Three and we're the last step and that I pick as I figure three sushi rate as a right because your issue

09:00.360 --> 09:08.250
from the dishwasher dish goes zero one as it is to my replacement because three will be converted to

09:08.250 --> 09:09.960
two and three additives.

09:10.500 --> 09:15.360
I know it's kind of tricky solution and you are not aware of the expected values, but first of all,

09:15.360 --> 09:21.420
I just suggest you to move on to the expectation, values, opportunities and two idioms and just read

09:21.420 --> 09:29.040
them out and then quickly come back to it and try and grasp what some famous examples of expectation

09:29.040 --> 09:29.490
values are.

09:29.490 --> 09:29.910
Nice.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.740
Very, very nice.

09:32.280 --> 09:32.490
I.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.430
So this is my reconciliation.

09:35.440 --> 09:40.970
You know, here there's another there's another thing that we've already explained here.

09:40.990 --> 09:47.080
We have four variables, but we actually don't need for variables rate by because always zero.

09:49.450 --> 09:53.590
That's one plus two plus three will be equal to in.

09:55.080 --> 09:55.400
Eight.

09:56.900 --> 10:02.120
Because all the dishes would contain added zero one or two or three bushes in them.

10:02.930 --> 10:04.730
So let me simplify this, a.

10:06.120 --> 10:10.370
It requires a relation, let's call them in shorter terms.

10:11.060 --> 10:18.640
Let's call them Z or let's say ABCD 8284041, two, two C and 3ddb.

10:18.650 --> 10:20.390
ABCD is equal to one plus.

10:22.570 --> 10:24.850
Probability of zero velocity.

10:24.850 --> 10:28.960
Where does this mean p zero and into the p of.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.200
ABCDE so it is dependent on itself.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.240
ABC News Division Only ABC.

10:35.510 --> 10:39.110
Plus for a day of running too deep of it, minus one.

10:39.710 --> 10:41.930
But you're plus one B, minus one c, d.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.330
Plus you do.

10:46.560 --> 10:56.650
Into the appeal of e b less one B plus one c minus one in D lesbian three or introductory lets eight

10:56.670 --> 10:57.090
b.

10:57.150 --> 10:57.410
B.

10:57.420 --> 10:57.690
B.

10:58.660 --> 11:00.310
We see empty NPD.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.220
It is kind of deep.

11:04.270 --> 11:11.410
E Come on, baby comma C plus one and B minus eight is our relation just starting the argument now.

11:11.410 --> 11:13.780
What, what we can see here is that here we have.

11:14.910 --> 11:16.350
It is dependent on the same.

11:18.660 --> 11:21.560
Know, it's kind of self-regulation, basically.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.030
So how do we solve this?

11:24.090 --> 11:26.520
So for this, what I'll do is I'll take this on the left hand side.

11:26.970 --> 11:27.900
And what will get?

11:27.900 --> 11:28.470
It will get.

11:30.830 --> 11:44.390
Debut of A, B, C, D is into one minus B note is equal to one B+, b, b, DP, this B+, b, c,

11:44.390 --> 11:48.370
d, b, this plus b, d and BP eight.

11:48.410 --> 11:49.550
I'm not writing it completely.

11:50.830 --> 11:54.120
I think I just got it on the left hand side and that store on the right hand side.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.580
So what is depicted here?

11:55.590 --> 11:55.860
No.

11:58.780 --> 12:00.520
It is equal to one place.

12:00.790 --> 12:01.510
This is it.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.190
Is this upon?

12:04.660 --> 12:13.360
One minus B, not eight, then let's define what is not B, B, A, BBC, and b D So what is B the probability

12:13.360 --> 12:15.870
of getting on a road?

12:17.740 --> 12:19.630
Getting on a number of.

12:20.830 --> 12:23.530
Getting on a dish with zero sushi, isn't it?

12:24.130 --> 12:29.020
It is basically how much it is EBA and I'm taking ABC 2012348.

12:30.020 --> 12:33.530
So B-Bbee is how much we buy in this season.

12:33.530 --> 12:37.430
How much are C-Band and PD is how much?

12:38.270 --> 12:38.690
Phoebe.

12:40.450 --> 12:48.280
And so ABC raised a number of indexes with 0123 respective number of sources and by areas that prevented

12:48.280 --> 12:48.520
a.

12:49.540 --> 12:57.850
So if I try to solve this by replacing BDB, see all of these values, what I would get here is I simply

12:57.850 --> 12:58.150
get.

13:00.810 --> 13:12.150
BP of e b b e is equal to two writing psb, ba and eight let's editors by BBN.

13:13.220 --> 13:16.070
In the SDP less.

13:17.090 --> 13:19.940
You buy in into this deep, deep ocean.

13:19.940 --> 13:21.050
Into this deep sea.

13:21.260 --> 13:22.040
One plus.

13:23.630 --> 13:24.470
One minus.

13:25.800 --> 13:26.280
eBay.

13:26.660 --> 13:29.820
And so here we can see that we have.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.640
And is it included in both the numerator and denominator?

13:32.640 --> 13:33.840
So let's cancel it out.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.220
It's simplified.

13:35.220 --> 13:40.920
It becomes an plus B into the P something plus C into the P something.

13:42.310 --> 13:48.310
Let's dig into deep something over and minus a.

13:49.400 --> 13:49.880
Well, this.

13:51.940 --> 13:53.200
So now what it is.

13:53.650 --> 13:59.560
So now we have like ABCD and we know that is kind of a dependent variable.

13:59.770 --> 14:01.210
We can simply figure it out day by.

14:02.540 --> 14:05.900
Same as it was to N minus B plus LSD eight.

14:06.140 --> 14:08.210
This is equals to d, b, ab.

14:10.170 --> 14:13.800
And I'm just not completing this inside part.

14:13.800 --> 14:14.730
You can do it yourself.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.160
Well, it's an easy thing to do.

14:18.150 --> 14:22.500
Now let's call this records of an eight.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.340
I hope this is very clear or.

14:25.560 --> 14:25.920
Okay.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.750
So let me quickly right the complete DP.

14:28.370 --> 14:30.270
What is DB initially?

14:30.270 --> 14:32.100
What will be my solution for this?

14:32.100 --> 14:37.300
It will be the number of zeros, number of ones, two entries that are given in the edit eight.

14:37.320 --> 14:41.280
So it is a, b, c, e is equals two and less.

14:43.060 --> 14:46.030
Be into the epi.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.920
But if what it does prevents me represents one bait.

14:49.930 --> 14:54.810
So it says that it is a plus one B minus one C and D.

14:55.880 --> 14:59.750
Plus being to the p, e, b plus one.

14:59.750 --> 15:02.570
C minus one and B plus.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.930
In the AP.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.940
A, B, C plus one and B minus one.

15:11.120 --> 15:17.270
And now complete we have and minus in the denominator, which is normal because of religion.

15:17.270 --> 15:18.890
It's got it out quickly.

15:19.670 --> 15:20.330
So yeah.
