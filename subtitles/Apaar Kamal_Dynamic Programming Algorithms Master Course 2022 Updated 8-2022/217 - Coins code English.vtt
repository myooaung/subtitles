WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:01.890
So let's put it out.

00:06.310 --> 00:06.790
Okay.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.220
So this is very.

00:10.830 --> 00:11.760
It's already see.

00:16.730 --> 00:17.480
Copy the input.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.720
Write a basic recursive approach.

00:19.750 --> 00:20.360
Nothing else.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.550
Then we'll see how to minimize it.

00:22.550 --> 00:27.530
Because right now we can see that it has a data complexity.

00:27.530 --> 00:28.880
It has a complexity.

00:28.880 --> 00:34.650
How many states are there, i.e. goes from little to an edge, goes from and where to doing?

00:35.030 --> 00:39.430
It's also going to go often and then B also goes from zero to individual.

00:39.740 --> 00:47.360
So again, it's kind of NQ solution, but as we can see that the constraints are not allowed for NQ.

00:47.660 --> 00:49.070
But yeah, we will see it literally.

00:49.430 --> 00:52.180
What is a trick behind it will?

00:54.500 --> 00:54.750
So.

00:56.050 --> 00:56.220
Before.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.670
Say, let me take.

00:59.810 --> 01:06.170
And be as, let's say, along the way, let me define it as a bill, because we are worried about rurality

01:06.170 --> 01:11.720
and we have to take of course it will work in the bill, but it's my habit to take longer bill as I

01:11.720 --> 01:12.890
take long longing for it.

01:13.310 --> 01:14.740
Eight or.

01:16.700 --> 01:23.960
So let's have this going in and is thousand eight and let's have an article, record player.

01:26.460 --> 01:26.850
Also.

01:26.850 --> 01:27.690
Let's take an.

01:31.600 --> 01:32.290
It's input.

01:33.100 --> 01:33.700
The input.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.840
Always to the largest take and the input.

01:44.050 --> 01:47.950
And now what we need to do is I need to retreat from.

01:49.160 --> 01:57.050
I was two and by two plus one and I will put this is I equals to this.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.710
And I will go till there's an equal to it.

02:01.710 --> 02:04.440
And so is actually the number of heads we have at eight.

02:04.890 --> 02:11.550
If I form my answer and say initially it's zero in answer plus equals two.

02:13.530 --> 02:18.870
MP So basically we have all the coins right now, so I'll pass zero with it.

02:18.960 --> 02:24.060
The first argument that you're not government is i.e. there is a number of heads, what is the number

02:24.060 --> 02:30.180
of days then if I buy you tomorrow, if it's two and minus, I is the number of it and I had to go from

02:30.180 --> 02:35.130
and where to place when to end because we want heads to be greater than it's eight.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.270
I will bring down the answer.

02:38.780 --> 02:39.020
Good.

02:39.230 --> 02:41.930
So now let's pull this DB apart.

02:42.650 --> 02:45.140
Here we have index I.

02:46.030 --> 02:50.800
And we have heard and we have is full be.

02:51.750 --> 02:56.550
So a very simple we have already seen the of solution for this.

02:56.910 --> 03:00.210
So basically if I have available.

03:00.990 --> 03:01.230
Okay.

03:01.230 --> 03:03.270
Let me take onset also.

03:05.450 --> 03:06.110
If heads.

03:07.180 --> 03:10.150
Are there, then I can make a type of.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.090
Transition.

03:12.090 --> 03:19.890
That means this going and getting it right because right now I had said available to me and similarly,

03:19.890 --> 03:23.360
if they said we really want to do that, first of all, it's added on.

03:23.400 --> 03:28.020
So plus it goes to it is EPO five plus one at current.

03:28.020 --> 03:28.770
I've got ahead.

03:28.770 --> 03:32.340
So it will be minus one getting a basic brute force rate.

03:32.790 --> 03:37.320
And this and what is the probability of this the probability of getting ahead, this payoff?

03:37.800 --> 03:38.040
I.

03:39.640 --> 03:48.490
Well guys now let's find the probability of pants on the he goes to the P a plus one edge and is minus

03:48.790 --> 03:52.420
one and this variety becomes 1.00 minus.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.000
Right.

03:57.390 --> 03:58.620
And finally, Elton.

04:00.760 --> 04:01.030
Right.

04:01.490 --> 04:08.320
So what is the condition now that I need to check it and, and it will automatically configure themself

04:08.710 --> 04:14.980
and we just have waiting for the last index and if I'm on the last index it is equal to when I simply

04:14.980 --> 04:16.270
return one.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.750
They are the otherwise I use less than end.

04:19.750 --> 04:25.300
That means there will be some hurt and there will be some because the cumulative sum is often due to

04:25.300 --> 04:25.530
them.

04:27.080 --> 04:27.480
Always.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.540
Let's build this in check.

04:31.180 --> 04:32.410
Also the Canadian answer.

04:36.780 --> 04:40.170
What we have is we have 0.612.

04:40.260 --> 04:40.650
Yes.

04:43.260 --> 04:43.890
Dig this.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.530
Is it a boon, Fabius?

04:47.950 --> 04:48.710
What does it say?

04:48.730 --> 04:52.540
You have to print it in the accuracy of time to depart.

04:52.990 --> 04:53.890
Nine eight.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.510
Before that word we use is we use said present it so out.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.920
Season and it's in 915.

05:04.950 --> 05:05.970
It doesn't matter.

05:06.330 --> 05:10.590
It should be 69 and fix the preseason.

05:10.590 --> 05:12.480
So we have this great.

05:13.840 --> 05:14.260
And.

05:16.590 --> 05:16.890
Yeah.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.140
Okay, now let's move on to the next one.

05:19.170 --> 05:20.790
Let me check for something big.

05:21.730 --> 05:23.430
We are getting the correct answer or not.

05:24.410 --> 05:29.270
It is 3821813821815728.

05:30.630 --> 05:31.620
There shouldn't be a issue.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.190
It's a basic negative relation.

05:34.190 --> 05:37.720
Nothing out of all the available coins.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.520
I want these many years in these mountains.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.610
So if I were making ahead, this is a transition.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.350
If I'm making a trail, this is a transition.

05:44.770 --> 05:45.910
But this is a world.

05:47.590 --> 05:48.880
But I want to memorize it.

05:49.300 --> 05:53.470
What I have to do is I have to take a 3D tape of my musician.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.340
It means it should be three dimensional.

05:56.970 --> 05:57.300
Hey.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.850
And, and and but guys, we don't have this.

06:00.910 --> 06:03.390
This kind of memory and this kind of paint.

06:03.790 --> 06:10.440
Eight Here comes a new, not a new basic approach of independent variables.

06:10.860 --> 06:12.750
Eight So what are the independent variables?

06:12.750 --> 06:14.910
What are the independent arguments in these?

06:15.570 --> 06:17.750
We have three arguments, which is a edge.

06:17.790 --> 06:24.090
And B what we can do is we can say that these three are related well in the equation.

06:24.090 --> 06:25.590
We can relate to what?

06:25.680 --> 06:33.120
What it means is that if I don't want to d I can remove it by because d can be then like the domain

06:33.270 --> 06:34.170
explicitly.

06:34.170 --> 06:39.480
Like instead of passing d we can do the minded explicitly by because.

06:41.690 --> 06:46.900
But what we say is that simplicity is equals to win rate and.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.690
I what is I isn't.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.180
So I0 an edge has to be whatever is provided and then d will be n minus edge eight.

06:56.380 --> 07:01.840
If I goes to one, that means edge plus d will always be equals to n minus.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.470
Explicitly will be equal to N minus.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.300
That's the religion.

07:08.230 --> 07:08.530
Eight.

07:09.160 --> 07:09.490
Why?

07:09.790 --> 07:15.970
Because let's say I made a heads on the first thing, then as would become H minus one and T will remain

07:15.970 --> 07:16.510
as it is.

07:17.040 --> 07:24.220
We can see that if explicitly, then minus identities equals two and minus eight plus and minus a minus

07:24.490 --> 07:24.900
edge.

07:25.510 --> 07:26.320
What does this mean?

07:26.680 --> 07:31.120
Then I can simply reduce this to remove it from here.

07:31.120 --> 07:31.660
And we can.

07:33.300 --> 07:39.420
We can say that he is equals to n minus I'm minus at eight.

07:39.540 --> 07:44.670
So I don't have to pass, you know, because I'm explicitly finding it in the.

07:45.580 --> 07:48.610
Function definition itself because it is now a dependent variable.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.500
Similarly, we can make error dependent variable according to this relation.

07:54.190 --> 07:56.620
Here I will be equal to n, minus edge minus t.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.180
Similarly, we can make edges.

07:58.180 --> 08:03.400
A dependent variable in the edges are dependent variable that is n minus amnesty.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.670
So these three are dependent on each other.

08:07.060 --> 08:12.400
So basically we can have two independent variables and we can simply derive that ah variable by using

08:12.400 --> 08:14.470
the two other variables.

08:14.710 --> 08:15.010
Eight.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.680
So here I simply remove this third part.

08:18.700 --> 08:19.990
Well, let's build this again.

08:21.330 --> 08:21.600
Yeah.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.040
So we're getting the same solution.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.730
So now we can easily see that I don't need a EDP.

08:26.730 --> 08:27.570
I just needed to it.

08:28.350 --> 08:31.680
Right, because we have only two independent variables.

08:32.190 --> 08:35.970
Okay, so some of you might be thinking that we shouldn't have it easy to write.

08:35.970 --> 08:39.720
It should have been written there only, and then we would have just more moist air in it.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.220
Yes, that's also correct.

08:42.090 --> 08:42.620
But what is it?

08:42.630 --> 08:43.500
What does this mean?

08:43.560 --> 08:46.410
Now I would memorize it by using iiNet only.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.530
But yes we can posti doesn't count.

08:49.530 --> 08:49.830
Right.

08:49.890 --> 08:53.760
Because recursive stacks have been called that many times only.

08:54.750 --> 08:58.860
So instead of erasing D, we can simply not memorize using t.

08:59.690 --> 08:59.990
Eight.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.400
Yeah, but really just memories using an image here.

09:07.060 --> 09:11.890
Well, let me go back and let's have tea with you.

09:12.160 --> 09:17.650
I have tea, but it's what I want to show you, that I'm passing it as a variable for my sake of understanding

09:17.650 --> 09:20.830
and so that I can write a better code what I want.

09:22.000 --> 09:22.930
Memories using it.

09:22.990 --> 09:24.850
So it will be an age only.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.890
So if answer is not equal to minus one.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.720
So I have to be adaptable.

09:31.750 --> 09:32.710
I simply return.

09:32.860 --> 09:34.840
And so the way that it sounds, that is.

09:35.950 --> 09:36.310
Zero.

09:38.790 --> 09:40.950
Well, yeah, it should work.

09:41.340 --> 09:44.340
And before this, let's say to memo to minus one.

09:44.370 --> 09:49.650
So the we face certain issues gays because.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.650
And I think it should be 3001 because you can have those many.

09:59.640 --> 10:03.630
So in the previous issues, let me give you a very good example.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.490
What are the issues that we face in the world?

10:06.150 --> 10:08.130
But it's minus one point.

10:09.810 --> 10:14.490
So they say, let's admit this and then we'll move on to that part.

10:17.710 --> 10:18.160
Okay.

10:19.650 --> 10:20.310
This place.

10:20.700 --> 10:21.660
I think it should work.

10:28.570 --> 10:30.190
It left me some frantic.

10:30.700 --> 10:31.840
There might be some error.

10:48.950 --> 10:50.120
Well, no errors.

10:50.510 --> 10:51.980
We got an acceptable solution.

10:52.400 --> 10:52.910
That's fine.

10:52.910 --> 10:53.390
They know.

10:53.390 --> 10:56.210
We know how to write a solution to say the normal equation.

10:56.210 --> 10:57.470
Memories will.

10:58.330 --> 11:01.720
And what I appreciate the transitions we have.

11:01.790 --> 11:03.610
Take the options that we have, basically.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.060
So I was giving an example here.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.720
So the example is very simple.

11:09.720 --> 11:10.010
That.

11:10.030 --> 11:10.720
But okay.

11:10.740 --> 11:11.790
Let me see if this first.

11:12.650 --> 11:12.980
It's.

11:14.150 --> 11:14.630
Points.

11:17.660 --> 11:17.940
Yeah.

11:18.320 --> 11:18.730
Uh.

11:20.050 --> 11:20.530
Who knew?

11:21.190 --> 11:28.480
But what I'll do is I'll simply say 0.1 plus 0.2 is equal to 0.3 or naught.

11:29.080 --> 11:33.670
It should return e well.

11:34.860 --> 11:35.220
It's.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.340
Nautical.

11:42.640 --> 11:45.970
Rates of autism say it is not equal, but is.

11:47.920 --> 11:48.810
It's Matt, right?

11:49.330 --> 11:52.860
In 0.1, 0.8 equals 40.0.

11:52.870 --> 11:57.910
Do you do these calculations due to these errors?

11:58.900 --> 12:00.730
Actually, there's a way of storing numbers.

12:01.390 --> 12:03.100
If you want to read about it, you can.

12:04.090 --> 12:07.750
But let me like start briefly explain you.

12:08.080 --> 12:12.220
Despite it, you do these errors we don't use.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.640
Floating point.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.490
We don't use floating doubles in monetary calculations.

12:17.520 --> 12:22.620
We use strings aid just because of these small errors because of storage.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.260
0.1 is not 0.1.

12:25.680 --> 12:34.440
If you take a variable and print 0.1 until like 50 or 60 or 100 length, you will see there is not 0.10000.

12:34.650 --> 12:36.240
There are some certain characters after it.

12:37.390 --> 12:37.690
Right.

12:38.900 --> 12:39.260
So.

12:40.220 --> 12:41.990
Ay ay ay ay basically up.

12:43.320 --> 12:46.410
Plug a backdoor in this eight.

12:47.070 --> 12:47.990
Oh, yeah.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.200
That's what I wanted to explain.

12:49.620 --> 12:52.140
I hope you understood this Queens problem.

12:52.620 --> 12:53.660
A very easy problem.

12:53.670 --> 12:56.610
Not a big deal now, because now we know what we need to do.

12:57.090 --> 12:58.710
We just have to start with the recursion.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.860
Okay, I want this number of eight, so I want this number of deals.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.470
But so for this going, I have this option.

13:04.470 --> 13:06.990
For this one of these options, there are these many states.

13:07.230 --> 13:08.490
This memories are ended and back.

13:09.620 --> 13:09.890
Well.

13:11.240 --> 13:11.840
That's it.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.300
And you've seen the next.
