WEBVTT

00:00.530 --> 00:01.190
Right, everyone.

00:01.190 --> 00:04.070
So let's board this problem called plates.

00:04.610 --> 00:06.350
So let's copy the input.

00:07.670 --> 00:09.150
With Basted and it's.

00:10.690 --> 00:12.040
In Italy, we have test cases.

00:12.040 --> 00:12.310
Right.

00:12.670 --> 00:14.230
Let's take the.

00:15.730 --> 00:18.940
While T minus minus eight.

00:19.180 --> 00:20.050
Also these are.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.720
Okay, let's kick the tires in.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.550
But also alternate kick start problem.

00:24.550 --> 00:27.830
What happens is we have to bring this case numbers eight.

00:28.300 --> 00:31.270
So instead of doing violating miners, miners, let's do one thing.

00:33.520 --> 00:33.880
Yeah.

00:33.910 --> 00:36.870
Let's say that is equal to one mile.

00:36.890 --> 00:38.530
That is less than equal to.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.370
He ain't and will just stay out.

00:43.200 --> 00:43.710
Yes.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.240
And.

00:46.610 --> 00:48.740
The cash, the number.

00:50.070 --> 00:53.070
Then finally will print out Z after it.

00:53.840 --> 00:54.090
Yeah.

00:55.390 --> 01:00.790
This and then will simply print so will called a function called solvent translation.

01:00.790 --> 01:01.570
And do that plus.

01:01.570 --> 01:01.900
Plus.

01:02.980 --> 01:03.780
It inserted.

01:03.810 --> 01:05.400
Let's just do that plus plus here.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.620
So for example.

01:09.960 --> 01:16.140
Let me quickly write a function called install and let's just return something written.

01:18.160 --> 01:18.640
Five.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.460
Nate so we can see gays on gay straight.

01:23.820 --> 01:26.070
Now let's call this function called solve.

01:26.070 --> 01:31.470
In this, what we are getting is the inputs are nothing but and can be and come and give them a p.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.040
It's this input then very quickly.

01:35.130 --> 01:35.320
Eight.

01:36.210 --> 01:37.710
We have three inputs now.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.880
Let's take this as an input.

01:41.070 --> 01:46.060
So what I'll do is I'll just take them as one base indexing because we want answers for zero eight.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.000
I'll simply start from one.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.860
Less than equal to an A-plus plus.

01:54.910 --> 01:55.750
Or in.

01:56.840 --> 02:02.930
Equals 218 as an equal to key and j plus plus eight.

02:02.930 --> 02:05.420
So what I simply say is let's just take them.

02:07.820 --> 02:10.310
Yeah, let's take int and comma.

02:10.670 --> 02:18.680
Okay, let's add plus one plus one and let's all take one more which is prefix of these values.

02:18.680 --> 02:18.950
Right.

02:19.220 --> 02:23.090
Let's method them and set a comma zero comma side of.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.970
So a good way is actually, you know, to take take vectors because we don't have to read memes yet,

02:30.970 --> 02:31.980
again and again for that.

02:32.230 --> 02:32.380
Right.

02:32.470 --> 02:34.210
So let me just do vector.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.190
So what we have is one vector of vectoring.

02:39.220 --> 02:43.030
And if so, this it will have and plus one.

02:43.150 --> 02:46.420
And inside it there will be another vector of length.

02:47.360 --> 02:53.630
O K plus one and zero, which I'm just taking some different ways of, you know, initializing variables.

02:54.730 --> 02:58.180
So we have this E and Lisbon and Kate plus one.

02:58.180 --> 02:58.850
And initially it's.

03:00.350 --> 03:00.880
Zero eight.

03:01.160 --> 03:04.280
Let's also take another vector called prefix.

03:06.740 --> 03:15.820
So what is the effects of something so prefix of I go my day it should be equal to but effects of I

03:16.430 --> 03:19.870
go here you can see this prefix are also nothing but a dynamic programming thing.

03:19.870 --> 03:20.080
Right?

03:20.120 --> 03:23.360
If I want to find prefix of something, it's very simple.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.930
I command you minus one plus E.

03:27.740 --> 03:30.590
So basically it will store the effects of the current.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.180
Right after this.

03:34.540 --> 03:35.410
We have stored this.

03:35.410 --> 03:37.900
And after this, let's take another.

03:38.830 --> 03:41.790
Vector, which is called DP eight.

03:42.640 --> 03:48.280
So I'm just doing it in a bottom up manner and like, like the way we have this table.

03:48.310 --> 03:51.100
Feel free to follow it in any way you want to.

03:52.170 --> 03:53.360
So let's Sudan.

03:53.610 --> 03:55.370
From one, I go still.

03:56.510 --> 03:56.900
And.

03:58.650 --> 04:02.730
C++ 80 on G from one.

04:03.720 --> 04:10.480
They will go till the end, duplicitous because they has to fill all these slate.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.830
What is the total value that we do?

04:13.860 --> 04:14.730
X eight.

04:14.730 --> 04:17.510
So x is the number of leads we are taking for the current group.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.020
X will start from zero.

04:19.020 --> 04:25.010
We can take zero played for the current group x is less than equal to key.

04:27.720 --> 04:28.020
Right.

04:28.350 --> 04:29.010
And plus.

04:30.150 --> 04:32.610
Why am I saying it is less than equal to K?

04:32.640 --> 04:37.740
Because for the current row I can only take at max E plates.

04:37.770 --> 04:38.100
Right.

04:38.220 --> 04:41.510
But this one more thing is I can take it next year.

04:41.550 --> 04:49.230
But what if the number of plates that I'm picking, which is D, I'm trying to fill DPA, which means

04:50.130 --> 04:51.080
what does DB do?

04:51.090 --> 04:53.790
Means it means pick giblets.

04:54.830 --> 04:55.340
From.

04:57.370 --> 05:08.290
From first I thought it was a So what if X What if God is greater than the let's say the case is greater

05:08.290 --> 05:08.830
than the rate?

05:08.830 --> 05:12.640
It's quite possible it gets greater than that means.

05:12.640 --> 05:13.630
I don't have to.

05:14.840 --> 05:18.770
Go for x greater than eight because x will go from zero.

05:18.770 --> 05:20.420
X will go like.

05:20.420 --> 05:20.990
I agree.

05:20.990 --> 05:23.780
But X will also be less than.

05:24.850 --> 05:25.160
G.

05:26.200 --> 05:26.530
Correct.

05:26.860 --> 05:31.350
And did the total number of planes that I'm taking and this can be less than correct.

05:32.550 --> 05:35.400
So I hope this is very simple.

05:35.570 --> 05:36.960
So I'm not starting it from zero.

05:36.990 --> 05:38.030
We can started from zero.

05:38.040 --> 05:43.070
It doesn't actually matter because the initial will fill all the videos with zero eight.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.250
So we can started from zero.

05:44.370 --> 05:45.270
It's fine.

05:45.530 --> 05:51.600
They can start from anywhere because the zero column is already for eight, so x will be less than equal

05:51.600 --> 05:53.830
to minimum 12 gig on Magic Brick.

05:54.570 --> 05:56.970
So if there is less, then that means.

05:58.170 --> 06:00.240
Number operating room to pick up.

06:00.690 --> 06:02.490
That means the maximum appropriate.

06:02.490 --> 06:07.290
I can be risky, but if I think that means I don't have to pick up all cables.

06:08.040 --> 06:14.820
So what I simply say is DP IED is nothing but max of DP idi coma.

06:16.610 --> 06:21.190
Prefix IED picking up IED attacks.

06:21.300 --> 06:22.830
Picking up speed from the current.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.570
And what does a kingdom do?

06:27.370 --> 06:28.420
Now go and pick.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.300
D-minus explains from the previous source.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.970
But all these values you want there, Max.

06:36.430 --> 06:40.070
And but and finally, what I'll do is I'll just print the final answer.

06:40.070 --> 06:42.860
The final answer is out the P.

06:43.710 --> 06:44.490
And Goma.

06:47.230 --> 06:48.430
Be correct.

06:48.610 --> 06:50.770
So let's build it once.

06:52.420 --> 06:53.260
Okay.

06:53.290 --> 06:54.430
One warning generated.

06:54.430 --> 06:55.270
Let's see.

06:55.960 --> 06:56.320
Okay.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.190
So sorry.

06:57.790 --> 06:58.660
You're done dipping.

06:59.480 --> 07:00.200
And coma.

07:02.090 --> 07:04.250
Anything wrong that I'm doing here?

07:04.280 --> 07:04.610
No.

07:04.850 --> 07:07.180
So you can see the taste of this vanity.

07:07.310 --> 07:09.080
And that is, I guess, the answer.

07:09.620 --> 07:10.490
We have to go on a date.

07:10.790 --> 07:14.930
Now, moving on to the complexity of the solution, the input is an indicator.

07:15.940 --> 07:16.480
After this.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.020
What are these?

07:17.020 --> 07:17.530
Followups.

07:17.860 --> 07:23.890
This is nothing but dn into b into whatever is minimum of danger.

07:23.900 --> 07:26.290
And so in the worst case, it can be later.

07:26.320 --> 07:31.480
And in the key is the complexity of the solution, and we can easily see that.

07:32.740 --> 07:33.640
And it's 50.

07:33.820 --> 07:34.090
Okay.

07:34.090 --> 07:36.430
Let me take the complexity and into.

07:37.650 --> 07:45.000
We do it and we know that B is less than equal to and and do so and into and into care.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.240
Into care because we can go to and integrate in the worst case they do then squared k squared and rather

07:51.240 --> 07:52.530
than engage and it's 50.

07:53.950 --> 07:55.690
And we're just kick starting.

07:57.180 --> 08:07.150
So this will be 00005 675 in the trees, 75 it is 7.5 and then it's about five, which is good in of

08:07.150 --> 08:08.290
complexity, not bad.

08:08.330 --> 08:10.750
So approximately, let's say just end this trip over six.

08:11.790 --> 08:15.120
I hope this is clear and it is a very nice problem.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.200
It is a must do problem.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.510
Do neutral yourself, I would suggest.

08:18.930 --> 08:22.800
Why don't you try this problem from the top down approach using regulation.

08:22.800 --> 08:26.820
In addition, it goes in the next what everyone thinks.
