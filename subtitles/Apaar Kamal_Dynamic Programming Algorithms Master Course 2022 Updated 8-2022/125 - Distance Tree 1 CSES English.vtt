00:00.610 --> 00:06.490
Everyone, let's solve the next problem in this thread, which is three distances one.

00:06.970 --> 00:12.490
And then we'll try three responses to and then company queries and the other problems.

00:12.490 --> 00:12.800
Right.

00:12.820 --> 00:16.210
So all of them are very related to the enemy programming countries.

00:16.690 --> 00:18.670
So let's discuss each one of them.

00:19.630 --> 00:24.400
Look, this is another very interesting problem that I personally like and.

00:27.040 --> 00:33.550
Back to the problems is your task is for your domain for each node the maximum distance to another node.

00:34.510 --> 00:37.480
So a very simple problem, which is that for everybody.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.820
No, just tell me, what is the maximum distance to?

00:41.640 --> 00:43.860
Any other day, for example.

00:44.840 --> 00:52.670
It's take this example and again we have and to to 200 and we will have to have an oil solution that

00:52.670 --> 00:54.920
can only be achieved using one ATP.

00:55.490 --> 01:02.360
So this is an example input which is one, two, one, three, three, 435841.

01:02.370 --> 01:05.120
What is the maximum distance to any of the node?

01:05.780 --> 01:07.280
So it can be four and five.

01:07.280 --> 01:14.390
So the distance is two or to the maximum distance can be add the four or five, which is three but three.

01:14.390 --> 01:21.710
The maximum distance can be two, two which is two, but from four again to and from 5 to 4 one it is

01:21.710 --> 01:22.880
two or two.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.090
It is three, four, three, two, two, four, four, two, three and four, five.

01:26.090 --> 01:26.780
Altered three.

01:27.410 --> 01:31.300
This is what we want in the 3 to 3 feet.

01:34.440 --> 01:34.860
So.

01:36.590 --> 01:37.590
How to approach this.

01:37.600 --> 01:41.470
And we have seen so many different problems right now.

01:41.470 --> 01:47.650
And we know a simple way that we have already discussed, which is the.

01:48.790 --> 01:54.040
There is a maximum lend of current to any lymph node in its subtree.

01:54.340 --> 01:58.450
But now what we want is we don't want this thing which is in its subtree.

01:58.450 --> 01:58.690
Right.

01:58.780 --> 02:01.270
We want it to be in any.

02:01.750 --> 02:02.660
In the completely.

02:04.030 --> 02:04.270
So.

02:05.490 --> 02:07.200
Let me write it.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.000
What is the current?

02:10.680 --> 02:12.660
Answer that is the lent maximum.

02:13.620 --> 02:14.750
Maximum lent.

02:15.940 --> 02:17.320
To any note.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.010
Incomplete.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.440
Basically, it's not just a subtree now.

02:26.130 --> 02:32.220
So if it were if it would have been subtree, then it is very easy for us to solve it because it is

02:32.220 --> 02:34.670
nothing but Jaeger and does nothing work.

02:34.690 --> 02:40.950
Maximum of g x which are child and plus one.

02:41.790 --> 02:42.090
Right.

02:43.020 --> 02:44.010
In logic.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.570
We have seen this already.

02:45.570 --> 02:46.770
That for any node.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.400
If I want to find it in for the subtree, I'll just ask there.

02:49.440 --> 02:53.400
Tell me, what is the maximum distance of this node?

02:53.400 --> 02:53.700
It's.

02:54.180 --> 02:59.460
It's like child do it to some of the lymph nodes in the in its subtree rate and add one to it.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.120
Similarly for this, for all the children, we'll do it right.

03:03.570 --> 03:06.960
These small things should be clear to.

03:09.170 --> 03:13.430
It was clear to everyone, office mate, I'm not iterating over it again.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.990
So this is a very easily understood solution.

03:16.010 --> 03:18.320
But now the problem lies in.

03:18.980 --> 03:25.250
The answer is not only for this subtree of right, because for this tree you can easily see that this

03:25.250 --> 03:29.950
distance of two is not actually from each subtree if I take one of the root naught eight.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.480
The answer comes from some other part.

03:33.110 --> 03:35.780
Basically the answer comes from its parent, right?

03:35.840 --> 03:42.860
That means when we go up before any nor whenever we perform a DFS, we always have this situation which

03:42.860 --> 03:43.610
is parent.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.770
Current Annex eight.

03:47.810 --> 03:54.050
So we are we always have these three drinks with us husband we perform a divas but actually as a child

03:54.050 --> 04:02.390
Carrington parent and this these are the siblings of current and parent might also have some other notes.

04:03.800 --> 04:11.030
I'm just giving you an example that the answer may not be, you know, in the surprise of the current

04:11.540 --> 04:14.630
or hip, the answer might come from one of the.

04:15.570 --> 04:19.780
Siblings of parents also like like by going upwards in their garden.

04:20.550 --> 04:21.750
So how will we solve this?

04:21.750 --> 04:24.420
How will we think about a dining programming solution in this?

04:26.930 --> 04:29.420
The first thing is that there are two parts of this.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.820
So the first I think is very simple, that I can divided into two parts.

04:33.830 --> 04:41.600
The first the first part can be let's find out this g value for the subtree of current because.

04:43.430 --> 04:46.430
It might not always be the answer, but we have to include it in the answer.

04:46.670 --> 04:49.910
Basically, we have to check for the subtree of the current node, right?

04:50.090 --> 04:56.720
So instead of G, let's call it F and it's called G of current the same.

04:59.130 --> 05:01.440
In subtree of current.

05:01.920 --> 05:06.500
So I just write subtree of current rate.

05:07.110 --> 05:12.480
This is very easy for us to begin to apply this logic and we can easily figure out what is the length

05:12.480 --> 05:13.970
in its libraries.

05:14.930 --> 05:18.420
So if we already figured out the land in a subtree, then what we can do is.

05:19.460 --> 05:22.790
Now what we have to do is we have to just find out.

05:23.060 --> 05:29.060
If I if I'm coming from top rate, then what is the maximum length?

05:29.090 --> 05:31.850
This is the tricky part for this case.

05:31.850 --> 05:32.660
What we'll do is.

05:34.070 --> 05:35.090
These are very.

05:36.170 --> 05:36.500
Okay.

05:36.830 --> 05:39.470
So these are very common word which is rerouting or freeze.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.960
But I'm not going much deeper into that.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.870
But you do get an idea of what it is.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.110
But what we'll do is we'll just have an extra variable.

05:49.020 --> 05:56.320
In the deficit will just pass a variable and let's call it distance from parent eight.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.640
And this is very important to understand this.

05:58.710 --> 06:04.620
This will come here and in many of the problems and it's a it's a very small trick as well as it's very

06:04.620 --> 06:06.690
easy to implement.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.080
Right.

06:07.630 --> 06:12.240
You'll see that we will have a very short solution of a problem we will solve.

06:12.750 --> 06:19.590
So just give your best here and try to understand what I'm going to explain this distance.

06:19.590 --> 06:24.210
Parent What I'll do is initially when we start from the route, I'll pass the distance between this.

06:24.870 --> 06:25.920
So what is distance?

06:25.920 --> 06:30.060
Parent So this variable distant parent is nothing but.

06:31.750 --> 06:32.350
Durant.

06:33.070 --> 06:37.660
Durant, then basically when I'm taking it like upwards.

06:37.720 --> 06:38.800
So if I.

06:40.330 --> 06:43.430
Just imagine it this way that I have a patent.

06:44.260 --> 06:46.840
I have a current node and I have x.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.250
What is.

06:49.800 --> 06:56.040
D of x g of x is nothing but the maximum distance to any of the northern subtree of x from x eight.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.620
What is our distance bearing?

06:58.650 --> 06:59.610
So this isn't a thing.

06:59.610 --> 06:59.850
But.

07:00.740 --> 07:02.690
Again, it related to GDP.

07:03.590 --> 07:08.030
Now the point is that GP and does nothing with the maximum distance of.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.320
And ignoring the subtree of parent to parent.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.050
And this time this subtree is like upwards.

07:15.890 --> 07:18.350
Subtree is opposed to current.

07:18.350 --> 07:18.860
Is that right?

07:18.860 --> 07:21.950
No, not in the subtree of, but in when I'm calculating distance waiting.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.280
Don't get confused.

07:23.280 --> 07:23.550
Right.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.560
X is when it's in this subtree of x leg downwards.

07:28.160 --> 07:32.030
But this distance parent is the same value is grading.

07:32.030 --> 07:39.620
But when I'm taking it upwards, it basically if we didn't, if this parent would have become this giant

07:39.620 --> 07:44.810
node of the current node, that is the value of due parent or distance feeding.

07:45.260 --> 07:46.040
Okay, so.

07:47.390 --> 07:51.500
We'll just assume that parent is not the child nor of the current.

07:51.890 --> 07:57.650
Of course, while performing the defense will perform anomaly of rate that X is not equal to being performed

07:57.650 --> 08:05.390
if is downwards, but we just keep an extra variable which will keep track of this value which is different.

08:05.780 --> 08:08.060
So let's see, how will we keep track of this value?

08:09.170 --> 08:09.440
So.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.490
Before moving forward.

08:11.490 --> 08:12.480
What we'll do is.

08:13.500 --> 08:13.740
Yeah.

08:15.430 --> 08:21.910
Let me quickly find out the g x value for every note eight so that I will really be using that in this

08:21.910 --> 08:22.570
transparent.

08:22.990 --> 08:27.250
And it's slightly tricky to explain, but you will get it eventually.

08:28.240 --> 08:33.540
But let's find out the g of putting in all these notes rated for this.

08:33.560 --> 08:36.580
You have gotten one subtree of the particular note.

08:36.580 --> 08:39.400
What is the maximum gap is zero zero.

08:39.400 --> 08:43.740
This is one, this is two and this is one eight.

08:43.870 --> 08:45.160
So in this are three of one.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.140
What is the maximum distance from one to any other?

08:47.140 --> 08:52.090
Note This is what do you guarantees and we can easily calculated even in the code we can just write

08:52.090 --> 08:56.080
a normal DFS function and have this work for us.

08:56.960 --> 08:57.230
Eight.

08:58.390 --> 08:58.950
So.

08:58.960 --> 08:59.250
Yeah.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.950
Well, so right now I'm just getting ready currently.

09:02.260 --> 09:04.540
Now, let's just imagine that.

09:05.890 --> 09:06.310
One.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.990
I'm like, I'll just write that down, which is indeed shooting off trees.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.010
It is.

09:12.010 --> 09:17.140
This question is slightly a mixture of the usual thing of reason dynamic programming.

09:17.140 --> 09:17.410
Right.

09:17.590 --> 09:18.550
But it's very easy.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.680
This rerouting of trees comes in handy.

09:21.310 --> 09:21.960
Very handy.

09:22.570 --> 09:26.440
And yeah, you'll easily understand what I mean from this.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.570
So let's start from the first note.

09:29.700 --> 09:29.990
Right.

09:30.150 --> 09:35.220
So initially what we say is, what is the emulator, their parent node?

09:36.060 --> 09:41.100
And the period before the Korean War one, the period is minus one.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.390
And I will just pause one more variable called distance parent.

09:44.930 --> 09:51.750
Like the value of distance between that means the maximum value the parent can reach upwards to any

09:51.750 --> 09:54.100
of its siblings or anywhere in the above tree.

09:54.730 --> 09:56.970
And we will quickly form little value also.

09:56.970 --> 09:57.240
Right?

09:57.450 --> 09:59.700
So initial pass distance between to be minus one.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.410
That means the parent is not there.

10:01.420 --> 10:02.970
The distance, but it is minus one.

10:03.360 --> 10:03.630
Well.

10:04.580 --> 10:05.240
Before this.

10:05.980 --> 10:10.790
The current is one where it is minus one and distance it is minus one.

10:11.390 --> 10:11.720
Correct.

10:12.170 --> 10:14.480
So now let's move to this two.

10:14.690 --> 10:14.960
Right.

10:15.620 --> 10:18.890
And let's have move to the to the DFS this come to.

10:19.220 --> 10:27.650
Now, the most important thing is now we have to imagine that when I'm going to do the current becomes

10:27.650 --> 10:34.040
two, the pairing becomes one and what is the value of distance pairing?

10:34.050 --> 10:40.340
Now, this is a most important concept that we want because eventually in the end, what we want is

10:40.340 --> 10:44.030
we wanted a fourth current will be nothing will equal to.

10:45.890 --> 10:47.300
Maximum of.

10:49.260 --> 10:49.770
Plus one.

10:50.520 --> 10:56.670
This is very easy to understand the is nothing but the children notes and the additions to the leave

10:56.670 --> 11:01.470
notes plus one will be considered for all the notes in the subject.

11:01.650 --> 11:04.830
But what about those notes which are not in this subtree of it?

11:05.370 --> 11:06.810
So where will that come from?

11:07.050 --> 11:09.300
That will come from distance parent.

11:12.950 --> 11:13.880
What is this inspiring?

11:14.880 --> 11:22.560
This from the parent to all the above three means to the tree with this complement of this object eight.

11:22.800 --> 11:29.040
So that means if I am talking about subtree of tree, which is this and what is a complement of subtree

11:29.040 --> 11:31.470
of tree which is pointing to it.

11:31.710 --> 11:33.420
There might be other nodes also, right?

11:33.440 --> 11:37.110
For example, if I'm talking about subtree of two, that is only two.

11:37.110 --> 11:38.600
But what is complement of two?

11:38.610 --> 11:39.060
It is.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.310
This one, three, four and five this distance.

11:44.310 --> 11:45.900
But it will just store the value.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.010
Same as the.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.020
But for the complementarity.

11:49.620 --> 11:49.860
They.

11:50.880 --> 11:51.810
Well, no.

11:54.990 --> 12:02.280
Let me quickly also explain this one more time, because I think this is necessary to understand.

12:02.550 --> 12:02.800
Yeah.

12:02.850 --> 12:03.960
So let's add this this period.

12:04.260 --> 12:07.080
This is the Korean War, which we are on in the DFS.

12:07.110 --> 12:08.040
This is the X node.

12:08.430 --> 12:12.510
This can be either child nodes, let's call it X dash, x double dash.

12:13.410 --> 12:19.590
And from parent, we can have multiple other three alternate, which is upwards somewhere.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.910
So we don't have to think about doing.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.750
We just we just worry about.

12:23.880 --> 12:28.050
Parent got into next and will perform this for all the other nodes.

12:28.110 --> 12:28.410
Right.

12:28.650 --> 12:29.520
But this can be.

12:30.480 --> 12:42.240
I'm y, I'm Z, some e, some B, so the g x will get the x dish will get g, x will get the this.

12:42.510 --> 12:45.840
This is very easy to obtain by using a normal recursion that we've already discussed.

12:46.320 --> 12:49.350
And now we want distance between which is nothing but.

12:51.640 --> 12:51.970
This.

12:52.120 --> 12:59.380
That means from this period, if I go upwards to the whole tree, then what is the value of the distance?

13:00.040 --> 13:00.700
What is the.

13:01.650 --> 13:05.160
A maximum value from this period if I go upwards to the tree.

13:06.210 --> 13:06.870
So that is what?

13:06.870 --> 13:08.880
Distance bearing in growth rate?

13:09.300 --> 13:09.810
No.

13:11.450 --> 13:12.620
Just imagine.

13:13.880 --> 13:14.150
Yeah.

13:14.650 --> 13:18.050
Well, let's understand this by changing this date in order to.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.690
So what I'll do is I'll just imagine it like this.

13:21.760 --> 13:29.860
Um, yeah, I think I have to make one more acronym here, and that will be very interesting.

13:30.340 --> 13:31.150
But let's see.

13:35.020 --> 13:35.230
Okay.

13:35.230 --> 13:35.620
Sorry.

13:38.370 --> 13:42.660
The diagram that will be very interesting just lets it.

13:42.720 --> 13:52.410
Currently I'm on this patent might be offices on this patent eight and that's basically is my current

13:52.860 --> 13:55.680
currently rate and its patents period was said.

13:56.730 --> 13:57.740
It's moderate as it is.

13:58.080 --> 14:03.900
And so it will be it's one of its style because, you know, there's only one period when every performer,

14:03.900 --> 14:07.560
two of us, we will be it's under the child this.

14:08.410 --> 14:09.050
I didn't know.

14:10.250 --> 14:10.500
Great.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.120
Okay.

14:11.780 --> 14:12.010
Yeah.

14:12.020 --> 14:19.610
This current node will be kind of X to this particular building, which I'm on currently right now,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.960
and I will have one more child for it, which is right.

14:23.180 --> 14:29.140
And finally, this x will have this x dash, x double edge and maybe extra polish.

14:30.030 --> 14:32.120
So these and these are the same structure.

14:32.150 --> 14:34.970
It's just that I'm I'm just trying to explain that.

14:35.150 --> 14:38.570
Let's see, I'm currently on this particular node of my treat.

14:39.680 --> 14:45.770
And when I'm on this particular node of this tree and just imagine that I have the right value of distance

14:46.280 --> 14:53.540
variant that is coming from top whatever is the value that means the minimum of the, you know, sorry,

14:53.540 --> 14:58.880
the, the maximum value of any node to this particular that in the about tree it's I'm getting the current

14:58.880 --> 14:59.860
value of it right.

15:00.530 --> 15:07.580
How do I pass this value, this distance bearing value, do X when I perform this DFS on it.

15:08.150 --> 15:15.020
Basically what I mean is right now I have some distance where in value I want to pass this value to

15:15.020 --> 15:15.590
this tree.

15:15.770 --> 15:16.250
That means.

15:17.220 --> 15:20.450
I performative is not a distance, but interchange.

15:20.460 --> 15:20.790
Right.

15:21.270 --> 15:21.600
This.

15:22.950 --> 15:24.690
Let's call it new.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.320
Distance parent.

15:27.420 --> 15:32.700
So this problem is slightly tricky, but I'm just trying my best to make you understand this.

15:33.630 --> 15:39.780
But can you think of something that a void will be this new distance per value?

15:39.790 --> 15:46.470
What should be this new distance be a value when we already have this distance parent value coming to

15:46.470 --> 15:46.860
this note.

15:47.010 --> 15:50.550
Why should it pass to this particular X when it is performing a difference?

15:51.540 --> 15:52.650
Or how should it pass?

15:54.510 --> 15:59.550
So the first thing that comes to mind is that new distant means from this current node.

16:00.620 --> 16:04.010
And in this subtree that and in this tree.

16:04.010 --> 16:07.880
Right, which is this tree except the x eight.

16:08.450 --> 16:14.600
I want to find out basically district eight I want to find out what is the minimum value that of what

16:14.600 --> 16:14.900
is that.

16:15.880 --> 16:16.800
Distance eight.

16:17.170 --> 16:18.130
How do I find it out?

16:18.700 --> 16:23.380
Well, as you can easily see, this new distance parent liquidated.

16:23.470 --> 16:25.990
Your distance period is nothing.

16:25.990 --> 16:33.910
But it can be what is already coming from its parent, which is this value less.

16:35.140 --> 16:37.480
One because I made this one transition.

16:37.480 --> 16:40.210
So from current it will be distance, but it will.

16:40.210 --> 16:41.720
It can be this eight.

16:42.250 --> 16:48.950
The second thing can be that it can be any values which is coming from E B or V eight.

16:48.970 --> 16:50.530
So how will I know?

16:50.530 --> 16:57.970
What is the maximum distance from E to its any of the lymph nodes in its subtree to be any other the

16:58.150 --> 17:05.050
not any subtree from y to any of the nodes in its subtree because here you can see right now a B in

17:05.050 --> 17:08.350
VI are actually child of current eight so.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.210
You know, did we?

17:11.430 --> 17:16.500
We already have the developer, we already have the DB value and we already have d d y value.

17:16.770 --> 17:19.860
So what is d d is what we already discussed.

17:19.980 --> 17:22.680
That is the maximum land in the subtree of the current.

17:23.280 --> 17:31.500
But if I already have these values, can I use this devalues to create the new, distant new distance

17:31.510 --> 17:32.100
between value.

17:33.340 --> 17:34.830
That will be positivity rate.

17:34.960 --> 17:42.130
So for this particular note, the first thing is whatever it is getting from its parent plus one, which

17:42.130 --> 17:43.240
is distance between plus one.

17:43.870 --> 17:50.800
The second thing is, whatever it is getting from this subtree is the maximum of them +182.

17:50.800 --> 17:54.940
Basically varieties maximum of g.

17:56.280 --> 17:59.970
E by my g b gamma d.

18:01.060 --> 18:01.840
88.

18:02.170 --> 18:08.680
And instead of that, what I can say is maximum of the child.

18:09.740 --> 18:10.150
Not.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.550
Basically, what what are the titles of this period?

18:13.610 --> 18:14.000
It is.

18:14.000 --> 18:14.600
It is.

18:14.810 --> 18:18.020
It is VI, but it is not that that is the end of it.

18:18.410 --> 18:22.550
But whatever it is getting from Oxford and Bousman and whatever it is getting from its side, we just

18:22.550 --> 18:27.790
didn't get it because we can only come from one being in eight.

18:27.800 --> 18:31.140
All the other nodes attached to it are actually state it.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.770
So whatever it is getting from all of these souls.

18:35.050 --> 18:42.330
Plus one will be sent to its next site as the new distance parent value state.

18:42.790 --> 18:47.000
Similarly, the same thing will happen for E also and for B also.

18:47.020 --> 18:51.190
For example, let me mock the same thing over here.

18:51.430 --> 18:52.070
Let's see.

18:52.420 --> 18:54.940
From this current, I'm moving towards E!

18:55.210 --> 19:00.760
It's a from the current I'm moving towards say now my DFS is on the right so I'm performing the Davis's

19:00.760 --> 19:03.070
on the for this particular.

19:05.890 --> 19:08.500
We are getting distance between from there that remains constant.

19:08.860 --> 19:11.850
That will not change the what is the value of new distance breeding.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.360
It will be nothing but.

19:14.560 --> 19:18.190
What ever I'm getting the D.

19:19.320 --> 19:23.880
Value that is DB from ADX Ramadi.

19:23.880 --> 19:30.480
What that means, what extended the shorter distance of for one of its leave not in this arbitrary or

19:30.480 --> 19:35.520
be moral deliverance of train provided one of the leading meanings of whatever is a maximum for them.

19:35.700 --> 19:36.450
I will be sent.

19:36.810 --> 19:37.590
I will send it.

19:37.590 --> 19:38.160
Well, you do it.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.700
Because that's what we are trying to understand later.

19:43.040 --> 19:47.600
The only key is that we are trying to understand is how to create the new distance, speed and value

19:47.900 --> 19:49.640
that needs to be sent downwards.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.380
So just think of the solution in this one.

19:53.800 --> 19:54.550
We have a parent.

19:54.580 --> 19:55.360
We have a current.

19:55.390 --> 19:56.170
We have an ex.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.450
So we already have distance waiting.

20:00.570 --> 20:05.970
When I'm moving from that point into some career note, I want to formulate new distance, but it will

20:05.970 --> 20:12.210
be distance between plus one or the DB duvet maximum of whatever they have plus one.

20:13.620 --> 20:18.990
And yeah, so that's a pretty easy solution.

20:19.430 --> 20:25.050
And finally, what any note, what I need or what will be the final answers?

20:25.260 --> 20:31.770
The final answers we will discuss it is nothing but and all the displacement and what is the distance

20:31.770 --> 20:38.040
between it is coming from its speed and near the maximum distance of any note from the parent of it.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.710
It is coming from the parent of it.

20:39.720 --> 20:42.540
So I just take that value plus one that night.

20:42.540 --> 20:46.160
So the x plus one, our distance between one plus one will be F of current.

20:46.170 --> 20:48.830
It is finally we want to print it.

20:49.670 --> 20:55.700
So before moving forward, I just want you to understand this part again.

20:56.570 --> 20:59.670
I won't explain it, but please try to understand this thing that I did.

20:59.690 --> 21:02.960
I just did hear about this particular variable.

21:03.440 --> 21:09.860
If I'm if I'm already having some good value, then what is the new value that it will be when I bossert

21:09.860 --> 21:10.340
downwards?

21:11.600 --> 21:16.760
Because when you bring a policy downwards, then the siblings or sorry the siblings of the current node

21:17.300 --> 21:21.440
which are E which are B, which are why they will become in the other subtree.

21:21.440 --> 21:26.690
So I have to take their maximum values from the early node, whatever the max they have from their lymph

21:26.690 --> 21:26.930
node.

21:27.410 --> 21:28.280
This tell me that.

21:28.850 --> 21:33.110
And from there I know that I'm getting distance, but it's already late.

21:33.410 --> 21:41.870
The distance between plus one I will reach to this better node or whatever plus one or db plus one or

21:41.870 --> 21:47.260
g y plus one, whatever the mix of them I will use for this note eight and I'll simply pass it downward.

21:47.510 --> 21:53.000
And I, I'll keep doing this for other nodes as well and will finally formulate the answer later in

21:53.000 --> 21:55.620
the next where will call it step by step eight.

21:55.940 --> 21:56.820
Those in the next foot.
