Small typo guys

1
00:02.820 --> 00:03.500
so, here.

2
00:03.570 --> 00:06.930
What happened was it was underscore n, I was writing right.

3
00:06.930 --> 00:08.790
But it is not underscored n and it is K.

4
00:09.890 --> 00:10.150
cool.

5
00:10.850 --> 00:12.110
And the second thing is.

6
00:12.110 --> 00:13.400
Don't forget to add case.

7
00:13.700 --> 00:14.240
It is.

8
00:15.080 --> 00:19.580
The output should be in this form  right case one and 20 in the end.

9
00:19.970 --> 00:21.410
Otherwise, it will not accept it.

10
00:23.120 --> 00:23.450
Thanks.
