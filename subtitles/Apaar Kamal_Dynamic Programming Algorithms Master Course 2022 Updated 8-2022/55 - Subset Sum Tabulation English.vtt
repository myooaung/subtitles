00:00.710 --> 00:00.810
Look.

00:00.890 --> 00:04.370
Everyone welcome and collectively.

00:05.410 --> 00:11.990
All this obsession problem by a fabulous from A to B recorded in tabular form and possibly.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.320
Let's just see how that table will be going.

00:15.220 --> 00:16.650
When will be will be getting fit.

00:17.500 --> 00:24.830
So here we have index as zeros, which is x and sum as the columns, which is eight.

00:25.380 --> 00:26.830
We have indexes, we have some.

00:26.830 --> 00:30.160
So we know what index across some table will be having initially.

00:30.610 --> 00:34.510
But initially we are on index zero.

00:34.510 --> 00:34.780
Right.

00:34.780 --> 00:36.190
So where is the area?

00:41.760 --> 00:42.420
Poppy this.

00:45.330 --> 00:45.630
Okay.

00:45.840 --> 00:46.370
Let me straddle.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.390
27459.

00:49.910 --> 00:50.160
Well.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.600
And two, four, five, nine in.

00:55.440 --> 00:59.730
This is the area and this is the number one in Italy.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.830
Initially we are on index.

01:02.170 --> 01:02.430
Okay.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.510
So what is the land of the.

01:03.720 --> 01:04.260
It is.

01:08.100 --> 01:08.970
One, two, three.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.610
Guys, don't get confused.

01:11.910 --> 01:15.480
If I am, you know, marking it as one based index.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.500
Or if you want, I can make it zero base or NICS also.

01:19.500 --> 01:19.740
But.

01:21.390 --> 01:22.530
It's fine both ways.

01:22.530 --> 01:24.030
You're going to understand it.

01:24.420 --> 01:30.680
So let's say the race when Mr. Nixon I'm giving you the one with all giving up on this index and the

01:30.720 --> 01:35.900
this is some but what doesn't index zero means that it's an empty if index.

01:36.150 --> 01:40.260
You don't mean that it's an empty array then is this some zero possible.

01:40.830 --> 01:41.220
Yes.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.070
And then one here is some one possible.

01:44.280 --> 01:44.580
No.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.020
Any of these sums up are similar.

01:46.980 --> 01:47.130
No.

01:47.160 --> 01:47.460
Right.

01:47.550 --> 01:49.590
So this was a base case that we did.

01:49.590 --> 01:52.770
We had actually called it eight and that was if.

01:54.150 --> 01:55.020
Here it is minus one.

01:55.030 --> 01:56.490
But, you know, I'm just taking the.

01:58.390 --> 02:05.650
Taking this Eddie as one base, and in that case, zero will be representing that there isn't a right

02:05.860 --> 02:06.530
index fund.

02:06.550 --> 02:08.170
That means I'm over here.

02:08.710 --> 02:11.710
Basically, the element is the element is two.

02:11.710 --> 02:15.280
And now they want to know whether.

02:16.390 --> 02:18.430
Any me alteration element here only.

02:18.940 --> 02:19.120
Yeah.

02:19.990 --> 02:21.820
The element is to win.

02:23.970 --> 02:24.240
And.

02:25.170 --> 02:25.420
Eight.

02:26.310 --> 02:27.330
The element is two.

02:27.720 --> 02:33.510
Then this this particular row, this first row will tell me whether I'm using two or if I'm not using

02:33.510 --> 02:33.750
two.

02:33.990 --> 02:35.040
And what's my answer?

02:35.190 --> 02:35.390
Right.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.310
Basically, if I write it as.

02:39.330 --> 02:43.860
At a then 33 than it is F of x minus one.

02:43.860 --> 02:44.430
Come away.

02:49.100 --> 02:49.610
Epa-Efe.

02:51.690 --> 02:55.230
F of x minus one comma y minus x.

02:56.700 --> 02:57.180
Dot com.

02:58.790 --> 02:59.030
Thanks.

02:59.030 --> 02:59.420
Main event.

02:59.420 --> 02:59.750
Come on.

02:59.750 --> 03:00.320
Why mine?

03:00.870 --> 03:04.370
It's based on what you said.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.920
Does any of the sentiment?

03:07.610 --> 03:11.390
So the first is directly above said, which is nothing.

03:11.390 --> 03:15.740
But if this is going away, this sell, will we x minus one come away?

03:16.220 --> 03:16.430
Well.

03:16.610 --> 03:19.250
So if the above sell is true, then it has to be true.

03:19.790 --> 03:21.050
I hope there is no problem in.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.540
I have no problem in understanding this because we are doing all right.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.770
So we've above the issue.

03:27.610 --> 03:31.060
It may or we may not check the previous cells.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.080
Both of them are fine.

03:32.620 --> 03:32.910
They.

03:33.930 --> 03:35.220
But what if?

03:36.500 --> 03:36.710
Yeah.

03:37.700 --> 03:38.210
What if?

03:39.260 --> 03:40.350
The opposite is not true.

03:40.370 --> 03:43.040
Then we can check for this in the second cell there.

03:43.340 --> 03:44.120
Any come away?

03:44.120 --> 03:44.840
Depends on this.

03:46.540 --> 03:47.980
Also in the previous round.

03:48.070 --> 03:53.170
Basically it will be like this, which is x minus one comma by minus x, which will depend on the value

03:53.170 --> 03:53.830
of x.

03:54.130 --> 03:58.570
If it exists two, then it depends on x minus one, comma, y minus two.

03:59.620 --> 04:02.440
If axis seven it is x minus one.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.360
Comma, y minus seven eight.

04:05.800 --> 04:06.100
So.

04:07.030 --> 04:09.700
The first thing is it simply depends on the above.

04:09.970 --> 04:15.220
So basically this rule will forever be true because what any of this all the above said is true.

04:16.030 --> 04:19.800
So if the above said is true, then this will always be true, right?

04:20.720 --> 04:25.880
Because X one is why it is x minus 1yy and we are taking over.

04:26.420 --> 04:27.830
So just remember one thing.

04:28.070 --> 04:31.550
If one comes over here, then it will go on forever because.

04:32.900 --> 04:33.530
It's possible.

04:34.590 --> 04:38.790
And what does this represent of that?

04:38.810 --> 04:42.710
Whether a subset sum of one is possible by using.

04:44.020 --> 04:48.430
The element Duke made by using or not using the element, basically the prefix of the air.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.500
So where is it?

04:50.500 --> 04:50.970
Sounds like.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.630
So let me write it quickly.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.660
So it is ab1 comma.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.880
One is the cell depends on it.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.120
B one minus one, which is zero.

05:01.480 --> 05:02.170
But my one.

05:04.820 --> 05:12.400
EPI one minus one, which is again the previous Arrow command y is one minus x exist.

05:12.900 --> 05:17.060
Just so you know, we won't be digging this because.

05:18.260 --> 05:19.640
The value is greater than the sum.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.590
So this won't be checking this.

05:21.590 --> 05:25.340
But for this we can see it is zero comma one or 2010.

05:26.150 --> 05:29.450
This is zero NZ unit out of bound before he answered.

05:29.450 --> 05:32.540
It's not possible for the next cell.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.940
What we'll have will have one comma two.

05:34.940 --> 05:37.640
It will depend on zero comma, one or.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.590
Zero comma zero eight.

05:40.870 --> 05:44.230
So tell me, is the zero comma to.

05:45.380 --> 05:49.940
But tell me whether zero comma two is true or zero is true.

05:50.090 --> 05:52.190
So yes, we can see that zero zero is true.

05:52.310 --> 05:56.150
That means a sum of two can be made by using this tool.

05:56.870 --> 05:59.150
Therefore, what I'll have is I'll have binary.

05:59.930 --> 06:03.530
Well, I hope you understand from where I am getting this.

06:04.680 --> 06:04.820
No.

06:04.860 --> 06:07.230
I'll look after this particular video.

06:07.540 --> 06:10.110
I will try to optimize the memory.

06:10.440 --> 06:11.480
After they will try to.

06:12.930 --> 06:14.670
Order and after that.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.560
What I can do is.

06:18.520 --> 06:19.150
I can write.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.150
I can explain to you how to trace back the answers.

06:22.210 --> 06:24.220
How to actually formally define an answer.

06:25.330 --> 06:27.400
Well, we will do that also.

06:28.190 --> 06:28.610
And.

06:32.930 --> 06:34.460
I did this.

06:36.280 --> 06:36.490
Yeah.

06:37.210 --> 06:40.840
And and, you know, feel free to trace back the answers.

06:41.050 --> 06:42.310
All the deep problems that.

06:43.340 --> 06:43.580
Well.

06:45.020 --> 06:53.190
So will get one and then it will be zero and then will be 0000 because we are not a breeding rate.

06:53.210 --> 06:54.920
It's the first problem, the subject and problem.

06:55.820 --> 06:56.960
None of this can be true.

06:57.360 --> 07:02.030
Now you know that if this is true, then this cell will be true because it is excellent.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.230
This will also be true.

07:03.230 --> 07:04.130
This will also be.

07:04.310 --> 07:05.180
This will also be.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.300
This is what I was just telling you.

07:09.270 --> 07:12.290
Let's talk about the sale, which is seven.

07:12.380 --> 07:12.740
Right.

07:13.160 --> 07:18.950
So the answer depends on the previous sale, also above sale and the sale on the left.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.070
Minus seven.

07:20.330 --> 07:20.570
Eight.

07:20.860 --> 07:22.340
So that is out of bone.

07:22.340 --> 07:23.480
And this is zero.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.190
It will be zero.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.970
Similarly, 0000.

07:26.990 --> 07:28.160
But now let's stick here.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.740
In this case, the above sale is zero.

07:31.010 --> 07:31.640
That's false.

07:31.980 --> 07:34.460
But what about one comma zero?

07:34.460 --> 07:40.850
Because here you can see almost seven, eight and I minus one from my do minus six will be zero.

07:42.050 --> 07:44.540
Basically it will be one comment and one comma zero issue.

07:44.840 --> 07:51.590
Therefore this the sum of seven is possible by using the first two elements.

07:52.970 --> 07:54.010
It means I can.

07:54.130 --> 07:56.180
I'm taking seven and I'm not taking.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.940
I hope you are seeing where the answer comes from.

07:59.180 --> 08:00.740
So this this answer.

08:00.740 --> 08:02.270
This one comes from this one.

08:03.750 --> 08:08.880
One comma zero and always bungoma zero formed when i00.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.050
That means I'm not taking it.

08:11.190 --> 08:16.350
Basically, if the connection is upwards, it means not to included in my subset.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.320
And if the connection is, you know, backwards, it means.

08:21.030 --> 08:23.210
Not a word yet on a connection.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.820
If it is not upwards, it is somewhere up and back.

08:27.030 --> 08:28.840
It means I'm including that into my.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.660
But by using this thing you can trace back this aid.

08:33.330 --> 08:38.310
If I'm going up, I'm not including it because I'm coming from this estate, which is f x minus one

08:38.310 --> 08:40.560
common y, which was about excluding the element.

08:40.980 --> 08:44.280
If I'm moving backwards means going left also.

08:45.470 --> 08:46.910
By going up your are all doing left.

08:46.910 --> 08:47.180
Right.

08:47.570 --> 08:53.180
The second part, this one, if I'm going left also that means I'm including that in myself to include

08:53.180 --> 08:58.850
the current element by you know, by formulating this, you can always trace back and figure out your.

08:59.890 --> 09:01.570
Coalition now?

09:02.410 --> 09:03.610
Yeah, I mean, quickly.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.710
It is not possible.

09:06.370 --> 09:07.210
What about nine?

09:08.370 --> 09:12.240
So for nine we can easily see the above through is it only?

09:12.240 --> 09:18.120
But this cell is one is one Goma two, which is minus seven or nine.

09:18.820 --> 09:19.740
So this will be true.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.110
And similarly, these one.

09:22.660 --> 09:28.330
So in a similar fashion, you can fill all the remaining end of this.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.570
And let's meet in the next part.

09:32.110 --> 09:34.900
We will this week also.

09:34.900 --> 09:35.290
We will.

09:37.330 --> 09:39.530
Or this automobile project.

09:40.340 --> 09:41.680
Well, thank you.
