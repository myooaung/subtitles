00:00.630 --> 00:04.040
So let's go to this problem level expression matching.

00:04.050 --> 00:06.300
And I already have this an imprint.

00:07.170 --> 00:10.050
This is the same thing, right?

00:10.620 --> 00:11.610
It can do a strings.

00:11.700 --> 00:15.120
And this is an example solution.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.340
Etch the out ash start match.

00:17.700 --> 00:24.990
And if I already experience all of this too is memorization simple and deep.

00:24.990 --> 00:27.300
008000 is being called.

00:27.840 --> 00:28.680
This is the base case.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.430
We know when the strings are empty strings they will match.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.180
If G has these the end, there's no more pattern to match.

00:37.260 --> 00:42.570
You do has these D and I is not used in eight, but if I would have to use the end then this case would

00:42.570 --> 00:43.790
have been fulfilled.

00:44.100 --> 00:50.190
I do you have these the n as embodied in false because nothing more to match and otherwise it's just

00:50.190 --> 00:51.240
memorization step.

00:52.470 --> 00:52.930
I'm.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.960
Memorization made this megacity close to zero.

00:57.960 --> 01:01.800
And now let's just formulate our case cases, the first cases.

01:02.340 --> 01:05.640
If B, D plus one is equal to start.

01:06.510 --> 01:06.770
Right.

01:07.080 --> 01:14.220
And the only thing I don't like about double dip is whenever you are asking for the next column or even

01:14.220 --> 01:18.660
the current term, you just have to check whether it doesn't exceed the limit.

01:19.140 --> 01:23.280
So here I just have to check that j plus one is less than Peter s.

01:24.030 --> 01:25.770
Then only I can take period plus one to.

01:28.920 --> 01:35.850
So if the administration priorities and if PGA Pacific was to start the next article is a start, then

01:36.210 --> 01:38.700
let's get in as a second case.

01:39.060 --> 01:41.220
So in the first case, what we thought was.

01:42.120 --> 01:46.220
Think both these cases have the same deep I plus one plus one.

01:46.790 --> 01:47.870
But what we can do here is.

01:49.170 --> 01:57.000
But I can say if I use less then as the size and add if one of these two conditions satisfy it is.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.550
S i s equals to p g.

02:02.130 --> 02:09.180
Believe me or not, this will be one of your smallest regular session meetings solution you will ever

02:09.180 --> 02:09.420
see.

02:11.400 --> 02:16.430
So yeah, if assays equals three equals two PJ, that means both the characters are same in the next

02:16.440 --> 02:16.850
category.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.680
The start that means is a match if there's a match.

02:21.090 --> 02:25.890
Answer or to a P, there's a Messi plus one.

02:26.850 --> 02:32.700
Andy in Nottingham, India this time because we wanted to match more characters because they start off

02:32.710 --> 02:35.080
pretty well and.

02:35.670 --> 02:36.900
And what is the second case here?

02:36.930 --> 02:40.320
Or if, say, the streak was repeated, this was the first case.

02:40.350 --> 02:41.110
The second cases.

02:41.460 --> 02:42.630
If BD is equal through.

02:44.850 --> 02:47.450
Our doctor with PTSD goes to a doctor.

02:47.480 --> 02:53.820
Then also we'll have the same because of our dependency that is hepatic goes only paperless when they

02:53.820 --> 02:56.690
buzz and open medical character and move forward.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.160
Look, this is.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.440
When character matches.

03:04.800 --> 03:05.420
Due to start.

03:06.810 --> 03:08.750
You too, Star eight.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.750
What if no character matches?

03:11.490 --> 03:13.200
No character matches.

03:13.710 --> 03:14.400
You're the star.

03:15.270 --> 03:20.700
So, as I said, let's say I wants to take the previous element with itself.

03:20.700 --> 03:24.150
That means just make no great damage.

03:25.470 --> 03:29.910
So if it wants zero off its visiting elements to match zero.

03:29.910 --> 03:30.240
Right.

03:30.510 --> 03:33.060
Then what it can do is we've already discussed despite.

03:34.420 --> 03:39.520
It is this baby I command you blessed to hate that means bye bye jobless too.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.620
Because applause when you start.

03:42.840 --> 03:43.800
It is here.

03:43.830 --> 03:44.830
We are going to deal with it.

03:45.210 --> 03:51.000
It doesn't want it to match and start matching from Duplass to and I will do it differently.

03:52.480 --> 03:55.810
So answered articles to the AP.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.730
I will remain there only and jobless to.

03:58.640 --> 04:02.500
I hope this makes sense and there is no character damage.

04:02.750 --> 04:03.710
I will not move forward.

04:03.720 --> 04:07.310
Simple and nowhere to match the start.

04:07.310 --> 04:09.200
I will take the corrective in itself and go.

04:09.530 --> 04:10.430
And it will take.

04:10.460 --> 04:12.150
You can always start writing from tables.

04:13.180 --> 04:15.010
Who better to second guess?

04:15.370 --> 04:20.380
What was this excuse that we had when the Knicks contract is not to start?

04:21.910 --> 04:23.440
If the Knicks get it is not a staff.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.270
We can see both of them are the same causes.

04:25.270 --> 04:27.850
So let's just put them in the running for you.

04:28.030 --> 04:29.920
If, as George says less then.

04:30.190 --> 04:33.760
But if I is less than as George says.

04:34.990 --> 04:35.680
And.

04:36.980 --> 04:37.610
This case when you.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.380
I say yeah.

04:40.640 --> 04:45.380
Think is if I say good superior the goes to a dart that means there is exactly one.

04:45.380 --> 04:48.230
Correct me if there's exactly one correct image.

04:48.230 --> 04:53.420
What will do answers or request should be a plus one because one character missed and g plus one.

04:54.310 --> 04:59.170
At one point mapping you this garden matches or if they are seen.

05:00.370 --> 05:00.610
Well.

05:01.620 --> 05:01.810
Yeah.

05:03.010 --> 05:04.090
But these were the cases.

05:04.600 --> 05:05.890
And then there's this third case.

05:06.380 --> 05:10.840
Well, of course, we are not worried about the cases when it is false, because we have already taken

05:10.840 --> 05:11.380
answers.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.000
Zero initially.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.360
Finally, what will happen?

05:15.380 --> 05:16.420
Will it in the answer?

05:16.450 --> 05:19.020
And here I have also memorised it well.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.680
So I don't have to say it again.

05:21.220 --> 05:21.970
Let's build it.

05:23.320 --> 05:27.660
It's for some kids favorite books and it's start.

05:28.270 --> 05:28.530
Yeah.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.760
But is the problem.

05:32.580 --> 05:32.990
Okay.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.070
So I think B generally.

05:36.910 --> 05:37.300
Let me.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.140
Let me quickly.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.670
You name it, baby.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.660
Late and heroes.

05:45.660 --> 05:47.070
I think there will be a problem.

05:47.970 --> 05:48.470
This be?

05:49.760 --> 05:50.480
And here also.

05:53.010 --> 05:53.310
Okay.

05:54.670 --> 05:56.590
Well this wouldn't give me a zero relative.

05:56.590 --> 06:00.490
I e now I think this should give me a true solution.

06:01.420 --> 06:03.730
Because this time I will take this list.

06:03.740 --> 06:04.630
I will take this.

06:05.570 --> 06:05.780
Yeah.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.180
And these two darts will match with these two.

06:09.480 --> 06:09.850
Beautiful.

06:10.890 --> 06:12.900
What if there was a star here?

06:14.630 --> 06:15.320
It's brilliant.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.610
So here we can see again because.

06:21.580 --> 06:25.690
This card can match with any of these is ending in a way.

06:25.930 --> 06:26.200
It is.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.340
This star is merging with the.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.830
But this daughter's merging with this daughter's merging with Disney.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.840
And the next day vanishes.

06:35.850 --> 06:40.590
So there are so many different combinations in this particular input and to give the output.

06:41.370 --> 06:41.660
Okay.

06:43.300 --> 06:46.960
I don't always you know, discuss and complexities of the solution.

06:46.960 --> 06:47.590
But I hope.

06:48.680 --> 06:51.230
Now it's not needed, right?

06:51.710 --> 06:54.470
You all should understand what is the complexity of.

06:56.020 --> 07:01.300
So here I in the other two variables I'm memorizing on the basis of I energy total states that I Entergy

07:01.930 --> 07:08.770
how many engines are there this installed size and do you did say basically aiming to in our end squared

07:09.700 --> 07:12.700
in chart eight is then consolidation of.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.150
Regular expression matching.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.230
I hope you enjoyed it.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.600
And this is alter to give problem.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.340
Of course I already saw that, so I was able to explain it.

07:25.380 --> 07:30.960
But always, whenever we are moving to a new problem, you should keep trying the problem yourself,

07:31.650 --> 07:38.430
like for one or two out at least, because these are some tough deep problems and then only come to

07:38.430 --> 07:39.030
the solution.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.190
Well.

07:41.290 --> 07:42.220
So thank you all.

07:42.610 --> 07:43.330
In the next part.
