00:00.610 --> 00:02.770
Everyone, let's move on to the next problem.

00:03.010 --> 00:03.930
This again.

00:04.510 --> 00:08.410
Here we have another interesting problem already.

00:08.410 --> 00:09.670
I mentioned to you that.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.930
All the problems are unique in their own ways.

00:13.350 --> 00:16.440
To hear from this problem, you'll again learn something new.

00:17.970 --> 00:21.570
The problem statement is there are and children number one to win.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.450
They've decided to shake your among themselves.

00:25.370 --> 00:33.050
For each I child, I must receive between zero and eight candies, including one we have entered and

00:33.300 --> 00:33.840
we have.

00:33.840 --> 00:40.170
Exactly Keegan is to distribute among those and children and any child can have 0 to 8 candies.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.500
Well, also, no candies should be leftover.

00:44.310 --> 00:48.240
No problem finding ways for them to share candies and.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.060
Model by number seven.

00:51.510 --> 00:56.310
There are two reasons to be different when there exists a different number of candidates.

00:57.630 --> 00:59.520
So the problem statement should be very clear.

00:59.550 --> 01:00.420
We are really screwed.

01:00.420 --> 01:00.900
Exactly.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.120
Kagan needs to entail.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.990
And there are constraints on all those.

01:04.770 --> 01:05.580
All those children.

01:06.770 --> 01:07.700
What are the constraints?

01:08.430 --> 01:11.060
I can get at most agencies.

01:11.120 --> 01:11.780
Not more than that.

01:12.350 --> 01:15.590
For example, for the first example, we have three child, four candies.

01:16.220 --> 01:17.750
Each child can get one door.

01:18.530 --> 01:21.130
So the first children get at most one can be secondary.

01:21.230 --> 01:22.010
You can get at most two.

01:22.010 --> 01:27.680
Again, these in the third, you can get at most three candies where we can see that we have five different

01:27.680 --> 01:32.450
unique possible ways and the first is only getting other zero or one candies.

01:32.450 --> 01:34.730
That means at most one candies.

01:35.060 --> 01:40.040
The second child is getting either zero one or two candies at most two candies, and the third child

01:40.070 --> 01:43.160
is getting one, two or three candies in this case.

01:43.160 --> 01:47.840
So the third to the third child in this case is not getting zero candies, right?

01:48.260 --> 01:52.730
Because if I give zero candies to the third child, that means total going to dessert.

01:52.730 --> 01:55.400
I can give two questions.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.570
They can combined is three.

01:57.160 --> 02:02.540
That's why there is no way possible to give zero candies to the third child because that is going to

02:02.540 --> 02:04.190
be the three and the two really going to be four.

02:04.820 --> 02:09.470
Well, so that's why I can't see any zero candies given to the Julia.

02:09.920 --> 02:14.210
So you can see that the sum of all these values will be exactly equal to give.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.250
It is four in this case eight.

02:17.150 --> 02:20.360
Basically I have and slots.

02:20.720 --> 02:26.420
I have to make some of all those and slots equal to key and the constraints are there.

02:26.440 --> 02:26.760
Okay.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.020
For this slot I can give the values from 0 to 8.

02:30.380 --> 02:35.320
I'll say this Lord, I can again give the values from 0 to 8 and so on eight.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.920
So it's a mean problem.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.060
You get eight.

02:38.270 --> 02:43.190
Again, this can be very easily bizarre, of course, and.

02:44.290 --> 02:44.560
But.

02:44.560 --> 02:44.860
Yeah.

02:45.950 --> 02:48.530
Let's try this problem by starting.

02:48.950 --> 02:49.600
By letting.

02:50.840 --> 02:51.670
Understanding.

02:53.850 --> 02:54.940
What this problem is.

02:55.980 --> 02:56.100
Who?

02:56.130 --> 02:58.140
Basically what?

02:58.470 --> 02:59.210
Okay, so what?

02:59.330 --> 03:01.530
What is the problem?

03:01.530 --> 03:02.020
Demand.

03:02.070 --> 03:05.460
The number of ways for the children to shake hands.

03:05.830 --> 03:08.750
Okay, so let's say let's hit that.

03:08.760 --> 03:09.050
Okay.

03:09.060 --> 03:10.350
DP But.

03:12.050 --> 03:15.200
Let's say that BP and GO has the final answer.

03:15.410 --> 03:24.830
What does it mean that okay, for all the engineering for the first in children they'd either distribute

03:24.830 --> 03:28.580
exit leakage and these let's see if this is our deep state aid.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.300
And what will we try to represent?

03:32.300 --> 03:35.390
It is what will BP and Gohmert be represented as?

03:35.690 --> 03:37.280
It will be represented as that.

03:37.730 --> 03:42.570
Okay I have and children and toddlers and this care and tell me the number of is distributed.

03:43.110 --> 03:43.370
Okay.

03:43.610 --> 03:46.130
So now let me start with the base case first.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.740
Hey, let's let's say there's only one site.

03:49.190 --> 03:49.480
Let's.

03:52.130 --> 03:58.720
So okay, so let's say there's only one jail and one jail total and these are four and the first year

03:58.780 --> 04:00.440
went to Gandhi's eight.

04:00.590 --> 04:02.190
So I think we have an example here.

04:02.210 --> 04:02.540
Yes.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.620
So there's only one jail.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.320
So we're going to need to be going at ten and.

04:09.480 --> 04:13.500
There can be at most nine Kennedys during boom eight.

04:13.950 --> 04:14.970
So what will they do?

04:14.970 --> 04:16.590
Number of ways to give him Kennedy's.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.390
It will be zero eight.

04:18.660 --> 04:23.430
What we'll do here is we will see will have a deep state which is called the pie coma.

04:24.390 --> 04:24.560
Okay.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.540
Or let's debate committee and we will see it.

04:27.540 --> 04:27.900
Okay.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.220
What is the number?

04:29.220 --> 04:29.730
Office.

04:31.430 --> 04:34.160
Number of fees of distributing.

04:37.400 --> 04:37.980
The building.

04:40.750 --> 04:41.150
J.

04:41.620 --> 04:42.220
Kennedy's.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.020
Who first students.

04:50.940 --> 04:57.900
And we'll try to fill it with what is a number of ways of distributing gigantes to first aid, to first

04:57.900 --> 04:58.860
aid students.

04:59.790 --> 05:04.980
So, for example, in the Syrian case, we have students who are going to these are really going to

05:04.980 --> 05:05.850
be the zero rate.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.090
What are the number of ways of distributing zero candies to students?

05:10.180 --> 05:14.800
It's exactly one that gave all the students zero eight no guarantees.

05:15.070 --> 05:16.420
Emily, we have a very big.

05:18.090 --> 05:20.640
Output have a very big input in an output.

05:20.640 --> 05:26.400
So what we do is whenever we could, when we write code before some reading will check for this input,

05:26.400 --> 05:28.050
then I'll be getting a correct answer or not.

05:28.540 --> 05:30.780
Okay, so let's ignore the constraints for now.

05:30.780 --> 05:33.630
Let's understand what the problem is trying to see here.

05:33.630 --> 05:34.500
We have slots.

05:35.660 --> 05:41.780
Let me take the first example, only that we have three starts with Jerusalem and went to three other

05:41.990 --> 05:42.560
constraints.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.170
So here we have three starts, case eight.

05:45.410 --> 05:49.450
And in each of these sorts I can fill some numbers and I want to do some to be looking.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.550
Okay, let's talk about the first.

05:54.180 --> 05:55.190
Number here, right?

05:55.390 --> 06:01.800
So in the first position that we are in and so what are the number of ways of distributing?

06:03.390 --> 06:04.020
Let's see.

06:04.650 --> 06:05.020
Okay.

06:05.070 --> 06:07.470
So let me table only this one book.

06:10.090 --> 06:10.440
There.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.130
Let's quickly make a table.

06:24.890 --> 06:27.410
So of course they will start from zero based indexing.

06:27.410 --> 06:29.660
So it's made from zero based indexing only.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.910
So here we have keys, and here we have ice.

06:34.780 --> 06:36.850
Well, what is case that?

06:36.850 --> 06:39.040
Okay, I have these mannequin able to distribute them.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.130
Tell me, what are the.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.860
Let's find the first rule eight.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.100
But what are the total number of.

06:47.790 --> 06:55.080
Okay, so if I give zero candies to zero students, there are no students or can I give them zero candies?

06:55.410 --> 06:55.830
Yes.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.210
That means it's an empty set.

06:57.220 --> 06:57.510
Right?

06:57.750 --> 06:58.740
So, yes, I can give them.

07:00.560 --> 07:00.820
Yeah.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.750
That means I can give them zero guarantees because there are no students possible for the total number

07:05.750 --> 07:06.120
of reasons.

07:06.150 --> 07:10.010
For one particular number of ways of giving one candidate, one student.

07:10.610 --> 07:12.890
You know, I cannot give, I cannot give, I cannot give.

07:12.890 --> 07:13.400
I cannot give.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.600
So why are we getting one over here?

07:15.620 --> 07:16.550
This is that case.

07:16.550 --> 07:21.020
When we have an empty implicit eight that there is nothing in there to the total number of guarantees

07:21.020 --> 07:22.040
is zero.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.810
Well, now let's fill in the Fosters.

07:25.810 --> 07:29.410
So let me right their values, also the continuing values that they have.

07:30.310 --> 07:36.370
But what if I feel so what I'm talking what I'm talking what they said, which is one comment, zero

07:36.370 --> 07:37.880
said, what does it mean?

07:37.990 --> 07:42.260
They distribute zero candies to 4 to 1 student aid.

07:42.550 --> 07:48.850
What I used to say to the first one students, how can I distribute and zero?

07:48.850 --> 07:49.960
And these are the first one.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.600
Students by simply giving him the zero guarantees.

07:53.260 --> 07:56.320
Eight If I simply give him the zero guarantees, what does this mean?

07:57.390 --> 08:00.600
That there's one way possible that is, namely, give him zero guarantees.

08:01.410 --> 08:02.910
Okay, let me try to do it.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.160
Give zero guarantees to one and.

08:07.180 --> 08:10.100
The civil restoration of the guarantees to the other group.

08:10.630 --> 08:12.510
Basically, here we live one.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.020
How I am.

08:14.810 --> 08:15.180
Okay.

08:15.190 --> 08:15.850
So I am.

08:15.850 --> 08:17.410
How am I getting this one case?

08:18.100 --> 08:24.370
I'm getting this one from this particular location because I'm if I'm if I want to distribute zero candies

08:24.790 --> 08:27.040
to first one students.

08:27.130 --> 08:27.340
Right.

08:27.420 --> 08:29.470
So that means I can give him zero candies.

08:30.530 --> 08:33.260
And what are the risks for the remaining and is it.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.490
I have zero.

08:34.490 --> 08:40.970
I wanted to give I gave him zero zero remaining guarantees now give remaining zero remaining and this

08:40.970 --> 08:44.560
to the previous students and with just zero zero data base case.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.660
Okay, let's move one step ahead and then you'll get this thing.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.820
It's move one step, just one step.

08:56.510 --> 09:00.560
But let's say I want to give one candy to one of the first one students.

09:00.670 --> 09:00.890
Right.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.380
Then there are these many of my students.

09:03.380 --> 09:06.860
Just give the, uh, just give one candy to these of the students.

09:07.020 --> 09:09.980
So what what are the possible ways to distributing it, guys?

09:10.460 --> 09:10.940
That means.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.360
And then I can give zero guarantee to the student.

09:15.050 --> 09:17.060
And then how many unis are left?

09:17.570 --> 09:19.280
I need to give one.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.680
I've given zero guarantees for the first student.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.290
And now how many candies are there to be given to?

09:25.340 --> 09:26.120
One can relate.

09:26.270 --> 09:29.400
So I'll give one candy to the remaining students.

09:29.420 --> 09:34.340
So, of course, there are no remaining students to give one candidate their remaining students.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.040
This is one way.

09:36.280 --> 09:39.130
What is the security that Gibbon can deduce of a student?

09:39.520 --> 09:40.590
And how many do you mean?

09:40.600 --> 09:41.620
Again, these are their idea.

09:41.900 --> 09:44.020
I really want you to give total one candy.

09:44.350 --> 09:51.100
I've given that one candy to the first student and now distribute the zero remaining candies to the

09:51.100 --> 09:54.220
zeroth student from the is really good.

09:54.220 --> 09:54.580
Is that.

09:54.580 --> 09:54.940
Yes.

09:55.390 --> 10:01.570
If I give one candidate for a student and zero zero student, that means I'm talking about this transition.

10:01.690 --> 10:08.410
It'll get given to him and distribute the rest among zero students or give zero to him.

10:08.410 --> 10:12.880
That means give zero candies to him and distribute the rest to the other students.

10:12.910 --> 10:20.290
That means distribute the rest one candy to the other students that is zero comma, one date and the

10:20.290 --> 10:23.440
number of years of distributing one candy 2007 days zero.

10:23.440 --> 10:26.500
So from here what will get is we'll get a zero in this case.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.470
And in this case, we'll get a18.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.040
We will simply market one.

10:32.060 --> 10:33.410
So why am I making it one?

10:33.440 --> 10:38.270
Why are the total number of ways of giving one candy to one student equal to one?

10:38.600 --> 10:41.150
Because there's only one way that I give him one.

10:41.630 --> 10:45.860
They can't be this way that I'm giving him zero and I'm giving one candy to no student.

10:46.160 --> 10:46.790
Not possible.

10:47.150 --> 10:50.720
Okay, then let's move one step ahead that will make things more clear for you.

10:51.470 --> 10:54.470
Now, let's talk about this particular location, this particular cell.

10:55.130 --> 10:58.070
What does this cell represent that I'm giving two candies to?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.060
Just one students.

11:01.850 --> 11:05.930
So what are the number of ways that I can give zero candies to this student?

11:05.960 --> 11:08.990
I can give one candies to the student or.

11:10.250 --> 11:15.080
I cannot I guess I can also give you again this to the question eight.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.750
But can I give two guarantees to the first one and no?

11:17.750 --> 11:18.010
Why?

11:18.020 --> 11:21.290
Because first one can be at most given one candies.

11:21.860 --> 11:25.730
I hope this part is very clear in the first and can be given at most one candies.

11:26.360 --> 11:30.880
So I will not consider this third transition eight feet.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.080
The total daisy was to do that.

11:33.210 --> 11:33.530
Okay.

11:33.530 --> 11:35.240
You have to distribute two candies to him.

11:35.540 --> 11:37.610
But I cannot distribute again this to him.

11:38.060 --> 11:40.790
I cannot distribute two candies to the first guy.

11:41.420 --> 11:44.360
Of course I can distribute two candies to the first, i.e. students.

11:44.600 --> 11:45.440
But I'm not giving.

11:46.610 --> 11:51.620
Exactly the number of guarantees he goes through to to the to the for student aid.

11:53.350 --> 11:56.920
Basically what I have is if I'm giving him zero guarantees, that simply means.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.480
Okay, tell me.

11:59.410 --> 11:59.640
Okay.

11:59.650 --> 12:01.480
It should be one comma to not to comma.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.250
One will confuse you.

12:04.420 --> 12:06.790
If I'm giving him zero guarantees, it simply means okay.

12:08.590 --> 12:10.750
Distribute the remaining candies to.

12:10.750 --> 12:13.360
If I am giving him zero candies, then there are only two candies remaining.

12:13.390 --> 12:15.910
Distribute the remaining and these to the students.

12:16.630 --> 12:22.540
Or if I'm giving him one candy, that means distribute the remaining candies to the other students and

12:22.540 --> 12:23.950
there are no other possible ways.

12:25.030 --> 12:26.410
So what does this mean?

12:27.220 --> 12:27.550
Zero.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.950
Why am I getting a zero over here?

12:28.960 --> 12:30.520
Because this will give me zero.

12:30.820 --> 12:35.560
And this will also me zero, because zero two is zero and zero going on.

12:35.560 --> 12:41.290
When this also zero eight, it means I cannot give those candies to those number of students.

12:42.820 --> 12:43.690
So he'll be zero.

12:43.690 --> 12:45.550
Similarly, guys here will also be zero.

12:45.550 --> 12:49.150
That means give three guarantees to first ICE students.

12:49.150 --> 12:50.380
So I is one here.

12:50.380 --> 12:55.030
So one commentary that means I can give zero going to the for student or I can give one candy to the

12:55.180 --> 12:55.630
student.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.600
I cannot give two or three number of guarantees to the first student.

12:59.050 --> 13:01.240
If I give zero guarantees to the first student, that means.

13:03.160 --> 13:06.880
Distribute three candies to zero minus a distribute.

13:07.240 --> 13:09.580
Again, these two West zero students.

13:09.610 --> 13:11.110
Not possible because it's zero.

13:11.710 --> 13:16.300
And otherwise, if I'm giving him one candy, because that's his constraint limit.

13:16.720 --> 13:22.620
If I'm giving him one candy, the first student, that means distribute candies to the four zero students.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.040
They were given and given.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.350
Anyone can do that is also zero.

13:26.360 --> 13:27.970
So if both of them are zero, that means.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.950
Where the sun will be zero similarly zero for you.

13:31.490 --> 13:33.500
Well, let's talk about the second location, guys.

13:33.650 --> 13:34.870
Let's talk about the second row.

13:37.040 --> 13:37.290
Okay.

13:38.180 --> 13:42.200
So now I want to distribute zero guarantees among first to students.

13:43.130 --> 13:48.890
If I want to distribute zero candies among first to his students, what does this mean that give zero

13:48.890 --> 13:51.110
candies to the second student?

13:51.540 --> 13:53.810
Right now we're talk about the second student rate.

13:54.380 --> 13:59.450
Give zero guarantees for the second student and distribute the remaining candies, which will be zero

13:59.450 --> 14:00.260
to the five students.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.290
Otherwise, what I can do is can I give one?

14:03.290 --> 14:04.130
Can you do this again?

14:04.130 --> 14:07.420
Student No, because this one will exceed G.

14:08.120 --> 14:13.100
That means this will exceed the j value that I'm going to fail the total number of candies that I'm

14:13.100 --> 14:13.610
going to fill.

14:14.390 --> 14:16.520
So here are two things that we need to consider.

14:16.550 --> 14:19.000
What are the two things that we need to consider that?

14:20.060 --> 14:22.130
I cannot give the number of candles.

14:22.640 --> 14:26.860
That means, let's say the number of candles given to some student is double key.

14:27.800 --> 14:33.950
This double key should not should be less than equal to J, first of all.

14:34.430 --> 14:38.300
Also, this should be less than equal to E.

14:39.560 --> 14:42.590
Because these are the number of guarantees that I'm giving to the current student.

14:43.550 --> 14:48.050
So if I can, I give him one guarantee because I cannot give him because I only have zero guarantees.

14:48.060 --> 14:49.230
I cannot give him one candy.

14:49.700 --> 14:54.740
Here we want to go in this transition from this transitional grade, one Y, because one comma zero

14:54.740 --> 14:56.120
is one.

14:56.120 --> 15:03.320
That means I can distribute zero guarantees to all of first one students in one number of is good.

15:03.770 --> 15:07.040
Now let's talk about this location but just to Goma one.

15:10.110 --> 15:14.320
So in Tacoma one, what we have is distribute one candy among first students.

15:14.490 --> 15:17.280
What are the number of ways of giving candies to the second student?

15:18.030 --> 15:19.560
Second student I can give zero candy.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.410
Then I can say, okay, distribute one candies to the remaining one students.

15:25.020 --> 15:25.980
Give us a constraint.

15:25.980 --> 15:31.590
One can be, as I can give him one guarantee because he's limiting ups to give him one candy and.

15:32.690 --> 15:37.560
Distribute the remaining candies, which are zero candies remaining because I had to I had to deliver

15:37.580 --> 15:38.150
one candy.

15:38.150 --> 15:42.140
I given that one can do the same instrument and now I have zero organism meaning.

15:42.150 --> 15:42.460
Right.

15:42.470 --> 15:45.440
So distribute the remaining candies to the student.

15:45.560 --> 15:52.170
So what I have is 111 common one is also one and one common zero is also one.

15:52.190 --> 15:54.380
So basically I have two ways of filling this now.

15:55.820 --> 15:56.120
Eight.

15:57.020 --> 15:59.150
Basically vice on my one two.

15:59.150 --> 16:01.170
Because he has two ways of filling this.

16:01.190 --> 16:02.480
That means adder.

16:02.540 --> 16:02.780
Okay.

16:02.780 --> 16:09.380
Let me show you what is and that'll give the second student zero candy and give mustard into one candy

16:09.800 --> 16:14.870
or give the the second student one candy and the student zero candy.

16:19.130 --> 16:21.710
The total number of bays is equal to.

16:22.790 --> 16:26.000
One eight the total number of bays is equal to.

16:26.330 --> 16:29.570
So the total Kennedy's is equal to a night.

16:29.570 --> 16:32.750
And I know we are just iterating over the second player.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.850
Then how many units can we run to the second beer?

16:35.120 --> 16:40.790
Similarly, guys, this position can be filled that is too small to which can be filled by either giving

16:40.790 --> 16:45.110
zero candies to the second player, one going to the second player, two candies to the second player

16:45.560 --> 16:50.890
five because now this two is also less than the value that we are filling and also less than eight,

16:50.930 --> 16:52.190
which is two for it.

16:52.790 --> 16:57.150
Let's write a brute force solution and just fill the table instead of filling it manually by hand.

16:57.170 --> 17:01.760
Let's let the code do this particular job of filling the table.

17:01.970 --> 17:02.240
Eight.

17:03.410 --> 17:04.910
So let me take.

17:05.930 --> 17:06.620
And in key.

17:10.250 --> 17:13.370
I'm going to have to take help of the cold in.

17:15.140 --> 17:15.410
Like.

17:17.490 --> 17:18.690
Finding further answers.

17:18.930 --> 17:19.230
Eight.

17:20.270 --> 17:21.860
So let me input this.

17:24.660 --> 17:29.220
I will start from one because I'm taking everything one with indexing so that we don't get confused.

17:30.340 --> 17:30.570
Eight.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.990
I'm taking the values and.

17:35.670 --> 17:38.820
Let's dig the --, which will be endless fun.

17:40.350 --> 17:40.980
He one.

17:42.100 --> 17:42.310
Mm.

17:42.370 --> 17:43.480
Search deep coma.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.650
Zero coma sites of.

17:45.620 --> 17:46.070
BP.

17:47.210 --> 17:47.570
Eight.

17:48.390 --> 17:50.500
And because I've just made everything zero.

17:50.520 --> 17:51.330
No problem with that.

17:51.450 --> 17:56.000
So what we had is the biscuits that we had, that 008 equals two.

17:56.840 --> 18:03.660
But because if I want to distribute 020 guarantees to none of these children, then it is possible because

18:03.660 --> 18:05.040
I don't have candies to distribute.

18:05.590 --> 18:06.720
Zero zero is one.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.590
There's the biscuits.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.760
Now let's write a brute force solution.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.370
And then we'll see that violent brute force like.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.080
Let's start.

18:15.500 --> 18:16.220
I from one.

18:17.980 --> 18:22.750
Let's go, Dillon, and let's start to the values that we are going to fill from zero.

18:22.750 --> 18:28.480
And this day should go down because what each of you have to feel all the values of all the columns.

18:29.770 --> 18:32.830
Now, guys, I want to feel deep idea, right?

18:34.030 --> 18:34.970
What this debate did.

18:34.970 --> 18:40.970
It presents UPI did a random adobe distributing jig, and this was the first student for the current

18:40.970 --> 18:42.500
student for the I student.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.410
I'm giving him the values that okay if I give.

18:46.310 --> 18:48.460
So basically let me do it also.

18:49.510 --> 18:50.770
Then it becomes more clear.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.430
The DP icon Maggi.

18:56.360 --> 18:56.570
Eight.

18:57.420 --> 18:57.700
So.

18:58.650 --> 19:00.080
What are the transitions possible?

19:00.150 --> 19:05.460
And that I give them zero and then I give diet giant zero candies.

19:05.460 --> 19:12.120
That means a B minus one G eight that give diarrhea and destroy a man in the street.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.440
Or I give him one candy.

19:13.980 --> 19:14.620
It is zero.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.170
I minus one j minus one.

19:17.010 --> 19:22.020
When I give him two candies, then it is a, b, i minus one, g minus two.

19:22.590 --> 19:23.910
Why I give him three candies.

19:26.540 --> 19:32.840
Then it is BP I minus one J minus three, then distribute these many days to these many students and

19:32.840 --> 19:33.260
so on.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.490
And how many guarantees can I give to anybody?

19:37.560 --> 19:38.030
A student?

19:38.870 --> 19:39.040
Okay.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.010
It should not be Max.

19:40.010 --> 19:40.790
It should be minimum.

19:41.420 --> 19:42.590
It should be minimum off.

19:42.770 --> 19:46.280
And then that is the limit of giving him or.

19:48.130 --> 19:49.000
The devil.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.640
That means all of these many needs to be distributed.

19:51.970 --> 19:56.590
It will be a minus one day, minus whatever this value is.

19:56.980 --> 19:57.240
Eight.

19:57.850 --> 20:01.810
So basically, guys, we have to decommission all these values because all of them are different ways,

20:01.810 --> 20:04.930
because I'm giving either zero or one or two.

20:04.930 --> 20:06.300
So all of them are different ways, right?

20:06.340 --> 20:06.730
Because.

20:07.720 --> 20:13.390
Of the last statement to the last admission was the two with us are different when they exist.

20:13.390 --> 20:15.190
A child receives a different number of candies.

20:15.190 --> 20:17.710
So I'm giving different number of candies to the U.S..

20:18.520 --> 20:18.850
Okay.

20:18.940 --> 20:20.800
So all of these all of these ways are different.

20:20.800 --> 20:21.700
I simply add them.

20:22.790 --> 20:23.010
Well.

20:23.240 --> 20:23.870
So let's go.

20:23.900 --> 20:24.200
This.

20:25.510 --> 20:27.790
So let's take of a legal double.

20:27.950 --> 20:28.930
What is the Bulgarian?

20:30.610 --> 20:36.640
It is as if I'm giving zero or one or two whatever guarantee I'm trying to give to the current child.

20:37.060 --> 20:41.980
So they should be minimum of the day or day that I'm going to relate to.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.240
What will be the value?

20:43.240 --> 20:46.450
DPA plus equals to DPA minus one day.

20:46.450 --> 20:48.550
Minus what we got.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.340
Yeah I minus one day minus whatever the values of.

20:53.180 --> 20:53.360
Well.

20:53.660 --> 20:55.520
So right now I'm not taking more than an alternate.

20:55.530 --> 20:58.940
So reading your time, just trying to fill up a table by based on.

20:59.970 --> 21:01.970
The brute force solution.

21:02.200 --> 21:02.390
Right.

21:02.670 --> 21:04.290
And now let's bring the table, guys.

21:04.650 --> 21:05.970
It's bring the whole table.

21:11.840 --> 21:12.500
You've said time.

21:20.910 --> 21:21.330
Not.

21:21.450 --> 21:22.680
And it should be okay.

21:25.270 --> 21:25.600
Right.

21:26.170 --> 21:28.840
So this is the table that we were trying to fill here.

21:29.890 --> 21:31.840
So the first row is 100.

21:31.870 --> 21:32.230
Great.

21:32.230 --> 21:34.300
When Miranda agreed, we had one too.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.130
And then the second step also what will get.

21:38.900 --> 21:39.110
Here.

21:39.110 --> 21:45.620
We'll get two and one and zero and then we'll get one, three, five, six, five.

21:46.370 --> 21:48.080
But how are we getting all this?

21:48.290 --> 21:48.740
Because.

21:50.110 --> 21:50.890
Divided.

21:50.890 --> 21:56.410
It presents a number of ways of distributing data and is true for states children's food and distributing

21:56.410 --> 22:03.790
some number of candies to the current student, which is this so it can be gives zero guarantees to

22:03.790 --> 22:07.330
the current student or give one candy or give to candy.

22:07.690 --> 22:09.590
Such that this costume.

22:09.590 --> 22:09.850
This.

22:11.770 --> 22:12.370
Considered.

22:13.120 --> 22:19.420
It is one felt that I can give at most other air conditioning or if air is greater than J, then I can

22:19.420 --> 22:21.400
only give the number of hands to him.

22:21.610 --> 22:25.270
I don't want J minus W to be negative eight.

22:25.930 --> 22:28.530
So this was the brute for solution eight.

22:28.570 --> 22:31.570
So if I submitted it on that kudo, will it work?

22:31.630 --> 22:33.070
Let's take the constants.

22:34.670 --> 22:40.670
Isn't it standard the buffet here I have 110 to devour five.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.370
Of dimensions of the brain.

22:43.520 --> 22:44.660
Let's talk about this.

22:45.410 --> 22:46.850
What is the total down time complex?

22:46.850 --> 22:48.920
And it is taking the space complex.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.760
It is 125 is going to do the ball with seven and that's good.

22:52.760 --> 22:53.300
Not bad.

22:53.720 --> 22:54.620
Eight but.

22:55.740 --> 22:56.640
What about tango?

22:57.060 --> 22:58.290
Let's talk about this or hear.

22:58.290 --> 23:01.440
What I have is I have an roski.

23:02.890 --> 23:03.370
Ross.

23:04.740 --> 23:11.410
The right way, jingoistic in the worst case, or is also less than equal to it.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.510
So basically it is.

23:12.780 --> 23:14.100
And in the Kentucky.

23:15.730 --> 23:18.910
Late because this double game is a loop.

23:18.910 --> 23:19.900
It will start from zero.

23:19.900 --> 23:22.060
It will either go it will go to the ending.

23:22.060 --> 23:23.020
The worst case can go to.

23:24.270 --> 23:24.750
Eight days.

23:25.730 --> 23:28.100
Or it can go to any icon also will do.

23:28.140 --> 23:28.320
Okay.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.300
So in the worst case.

23:30.050 --> 23:33.770
This bulky look can also go delegating.

23:33.770 --> 23:37.520
So it is an endgame book and is a great case to end the buffet.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.070
So it is and in the case quite a solution.

23:41.470 --> 23:43.900
NQ Square vision artwork.

23:43.990 --> 23:44.250
Right.

23:44.260 --> 23:48.640
Because cased ended about five and then it will go to ten to the power 12 eight.

23:52.520 --> 23:55.160
NATO and the US solution will never work.

23:55.910 --> 23:57.470
So we need to optimize it, right?

23:57.470 --> 23:58.830
So to optimize it.

23:58.850 --> 24:03.260
What we'll do is we'll see a special thing that.

24:04.780 --> 24:08.440
We'll just note one very special thing, and it's not that special.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.940
I hope you all know what terrific sums ain't waterproof victims.

24:13.030 --> 24:17.530
It is the sum of UST and comes so perfect off and is for us.

24:17.770 --> 24:18.290
Some of us.

24:18.310 --> 24:27.850
And so it is all again the anime programming prefix calculation that the fixed in I is equal to e less

24:28.180 --> 24:30.850
prefix still I minus one eight.

24:31.210 --> 24:33.790
But we can easily find a prefix using this approach.

24:33.790 --> 24:35.050
You all have must have done that.

24:35.590 --> 24:37.450
It's not go to the that part.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.490
So here what we can see is that.

24:39.490 --> 24:39.880
Yes.

24:41.220 --> 24:41.880
We need.

24:43.200 --> 24:49.110
What we need is we need some of conjugative subsidies of the previous rule.

24:49.860 --> 24:55.560
That is a minus one g, i.e. minus one g, minus one minus one, minus two elements one do minus three

24:55.560 --> 24:56.010
and so on.

24:56.490 --> 24:57.210
What example?

24:57.210 --> 25:03.390
For example, for this particular six, let's let me raise this eight so far, this particular location

25:03.390 --> 25:08.100
that is economic three what are the total sums that I want and that I can give him?

25:08.100 --> 25:11.220
Zero That means I want this and then I can give him one.

25:11.250 --> 25:13.290
That means I want this, I can give him two.

25:13.290 --> 25:14.940
I want this or I can give him three.

25:14.940 --> 25:15.540
I want this.

25:15.900 --> 25:16.780
I want this.

25:16.780 --> 25:17.010
So.

25:19.150 --> 25:19.470
Late.

25:20.930 --> 25:24.780
So here we can see that we have some of Hong Kong.

25:26.060 --> 25:27.350
I'm a continuous.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.990
Deep values are already filled.

25:30.440 --> 25:30.860
That is.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.460
I mean, this one is for the previous room.

25:34.520 --> 25:35.840
Let's not worry about it.

25:36.130 --> 25:36.560
There it is.

25:36.680 --> 25:37.970
J j minus one.

25:37.970 --> 25:38.660
J minus two.

25:38.660 --> 25:39.280
J minus three.

25:39.290 --> 25:39.830
And so on.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.560
Until this constant is.

25:44.300 --> 25:46.000
A welfare state.

25:46.620 --> 25:50.840
But basically what we have is let's say let's talk about this last sentence.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.310
Triggerman for what?

25:52.310 --> 25:54.700
Triggerman for guys, what we get, what we can do it.

25:54.710 --> 25:57.590
And I can give him zero one, two or three, right?

25:58.130 --> 25:59.630
If I give him zero, I want this.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.390
If I give him one, I want this some.

26:02.340 --> 26:03.500
Two, three.

26:03.750 --> 26:06.480
I cannot give him forward because the concern does.

26:07.950 --> 26:10.260
Because eyes to the eye can only give them till three.

26:10.260 --> 26:15.150
I cannot give him four so I don't need to go zero value you will take on my foot.

26:15.630 --> 26:19.020
I just want the sum of these consecutive.

26:20.140 --> 26:22.340
And I want this this to what is this?

26:22.340 --> 26:22.960
I mean, this fight.

26:23.440 --> 26:25.360
That's why I'm getting 5 to 8.

26:25.360 --> 26:30.700
So that's why the total onset of the coma for that means distributing four guarantees to first three

26:30.700 --> 26:32.980
students by eight.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.810
So that's our final answer.

26:34.810 --> 26:37.120
That's what we are getting you.

26:38.430 --> 26:42.540
But instead of applying this for a loop, what we'll do is we'll simply apply.

26:44.360 --> 26:51.830
But if victims will simply take terrific sums of the above through, will have the above Roe and will

26:51.830 --> 26:59.660
take the prefix home and will include the sum that we want in the violence and that much we want.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.730
So let's do this in the next part.
