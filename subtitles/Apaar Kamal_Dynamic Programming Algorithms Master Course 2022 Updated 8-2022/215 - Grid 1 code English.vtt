00:00.600 --> 00:01.800
Let's go it out quickly.

00:04.170 --> 00:10.230
Oh, what we have we have we have we have this and we have strings and and m instincts.

00:11.490 --> 00:13.960
Hit them and am.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.050
And we have this thing.

00:20.070 --> 00:22.650
It's a and then let's import them.

00:26.630 --> 00:26.930
Okay.

00:27.020 --> 00:32.600
So let's make going to BP area in which we'll be filling it and also do it exhaustively.

00:32.900 --> 00:37.240
Shouldn't be an issue to start from and go ma'am and call the requisite eight.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.470
If it is zero, it better than zero divided.

00:42.180 --> 00:44.100
So it's a late start.

00:45.970 --> 00:46.720
What I do is.

00:47.290 --> 00:48.730
Okay, so I'm starting from zero.

00:48.730 --> 00:49.990
So I have to like.

00:51.580 --> 00:55.140
Consider the zero indexing and Dick's stories.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.550
If I requested zero.

01:01.140 --> 01:05.050
Or let's see if I the question zero and the question zero that it's.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.160
DB 008000 is one.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.360
But it's a deep.

01:10.690 --> 01:11.050
I.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.670
J is one eight.

01:15.070 --> 01:19.090
Else if I zero, then if I 0 a.m. on the first.

01:19.090 --> 01:22.160
True, I can only come from left and not from up eight.

01:22.230 --> 01:27.390
Then b b i is d b i do minus one.

01:28.190 --> 01:29.060
As if.

01:30.420 --> 01:31.890
J0 that means I'm on the.

01:33.410 --> 01:35.930
First column I so I can only come from top.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.070
I cannot come from left.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.770
So here what I have is Libya is deep.

01:39.770 --> 01:40.780
I minus one g.

01:42.330 --> 01:42.590
It's.

01:47.470 --> 01:50.990
As is the case when we are in some way it is or it will be simply to be.

01:51.010 --> 01:58.750
It is equal to b, b, i.e. e minus one plus DP, i.e. minus one energy.

01:58.930 --> 02:02.320
So we have two places from which we can come, right?

02:02.530 --> 02:08.200
And after this is when this is calculated, let's look over identity value by simply saying if it's

02:08.200 --> 02:08.680
a blocked.

02:08.700 --> 02:12.250
But if s I do is equal to.

02:13.290 --> 02:16.980
Hash if it's a blocked but then simply divides.

02:18.030 --> 02:18.330
Zero.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.070
So no matter what is feeling it.

02:20.980 --> 02:21.310
But he.

02:22.670 --> 02:27.860
I simply market data rate so that the other DBS don't use it.

02:29.440 --> 02:29.660
Well.

02:30.130 --> 02:32.950
And finally, where's my final answer to the deep end?

02:32.950 --> 02:35.010
Minus one and minus eight.

02:35.020 --> 02:35.500
So here.

02:38.960 --> 02:39.770
Are we getting three?

02:39.800 --> 02:40.820
Yeah, we're getting three.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.130
Beginning zero grade.

02:48.370 --> 02:49.150
We are getting.

02:51.670 --> 02:52.150
Ernie Foot.

02:52.870 --> 02:53.190
Great.

02:53.900 --> 02:56.830
Well, I think this should work well here.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.470
We haven't missed one thing that we haven't taken mod.

03:00.630 --> 03:02.810
From tainted by nameless seven bullet statement.

03:03.530 --> 03:09.260
Okay, so let's say I have 13, which is one in nine plus seven command.

03:09.990 --> 03:15.330
And whenever I'm calculating deep, I just simply say, is it statement?

03:16.440 --> 03:18.630
Eight nights of a cancellation.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.160
Committed.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.520
It's sick.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.020
And so I really understood this Maude part.

03:30.410 --> 03:37.880
So we are just making it one or we are making it equal, or we are kind of adding to it.

03:37.880 --> 03:44.720
And so when both these values are less than mine and we're adding them to the way we like, we release

03:44.720 --> 03:48.680
and after, then we can take more as a global variable type thing.

03:48.890 --> 03:50.810
Or what we can do is we can also take Maude here.

03:50.990 --> 03:59.360
It will still work because this is what we are copying that's already modelled by and here only we are

03:59.360 --> 04:00.290
doing the calculation.

04:01.290 --> 04:03.010
Well, yeah.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.980
So the time is very less 37 milliseconds.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.100
And then the next part goes, I going to sort this.
