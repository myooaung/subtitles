00:00.590 --> 00:03.320
And everyone, welcome to this part.

00:03.590 --> 00:08.870
And in this again, we'll understand how to find the cause of solutions when there doesn't exist to

00:08.870 --> 00:09.770
the cause of solutions.

00:10.520 --> 00:15.830
So I would give a very, very, very simple problem, the most easy problem there would be in this year,

00:15.830 --> 00:22.130
any programming, which is three number of segments for each number from one to entry, for example,

00:22.130 --> 00:23.390
it's n is equal to ten.

00:24.840 --> 00:28.440
It's what I have to do is I have to print I have to actually see out.

00:29.570 --> 00:31.760
Enemas they maradona's ten numbers.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.230
Let me just.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.350
Write those numbers over here.

00:37.650 --> 00:38.970
Their numbers from 1 to 10.

00:39.150 --> 00:40.770
And we have their binaries, right.

00:40.770 --> 00:43.210
So one's binaries, one and twos binaries.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.290
There's three or five.

00:47.390 --> 00:47.800
Six.

00:48.650 --> 00:49.100
Seven.

00:50.030 --> 00:50.540
It.

00:51.560 --> 00:52.020
Nine.

00:52.040 --> 00:55.430
So I hope you know about binary, because this is very important.

00:56.390 --> 01:01.280
And what I what I have to print, I have to print the number of said words for each number.

01:01.540 --> 01:02.750
Rachel, how many are there today?

01:02.750 --> 01:03.170
In one.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.300
But what is the meaning of said?

01:05.670 --> 01:07.820
It is the count of ones in the binary of it.

01:08.330 --> 01:08.840
How many said?

01:08.890 --> 01:10.340
Retiring to one?

01:11.150 --> 01:11.470
Three.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.360
We have to separate.

01:12.390 --> 01:13.070
We have two ones.

01:13.550 --> 01:14.000
Or four.

01:14.000 --> 01:14.420
We have.

01:15.710 --> 01:18.440
One said, but I have to say it.

01:19.530 --> 01:21.270
Similarly to save two birds trees.

01:21.270 --> 01:24.090
Edwards once said bird and.

01:25.520 --> 01:29.990
This is you said it and I going to say it, but basically I have to print this out.

01:30.530 --> 01:33.890
And so you all might be wondering that it's a very easy solution.

01:34.580 --> 01:41.810
You just held onto the code editor ranallo from at the end gala function which will give you the number

01:41.810 --> 01:44.030
of said it's eight but.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.090
What is the complexity of it?

01:47.150 --> 01:47.960
If I just.

01:47.960 --> 01:48.260
You know.

01:48.500 --> 01:48.890
Right.

01:49.340 --> 01:51.140
Okay, let me let me put.

01:55.250 --> 01:55.520
Okay.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.680
I think I need to save this one.

01:58.130 --> 01:59.150
Let me save this.

01:59.630 --> 02:00.500
And it's called.

02:01.370 --> 02:01.910
This.

02:02.860 --> 02:04.690
No consecutive.

02:06.090 --> 02:06.440
Sorry.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.340
And let me close this.

02:13.500 --> 02:17.880
But this particular problem, you all might be wondering that what he will do is nothing where you just

02:17.880 --> 02:20.430
start your loop from one to in.

02:22.120 --> 02:29.170
One, two and whatever the value of Venice eight and what you will do is you just the out and you'll

02:29.170 --> 02:35.980
just write a function which will just give you how many number of said which the eight and this is the

02:35.980 --> 02:36.550
most.

02:37.530 --> 02:39.120
Easiest brute force solution.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.400
And also you can see the complexity is not much.

02:42.210 --> 02:44.310
Because if I write a function which is.

02:46.090 --> 02:46.990
Later in.

02:48.030 --> 02:49.620
And let me call it a return.

02:50.580 --> 02:51.940
That --.

02:53.130 --> 02:56.170
What how much complexity of this function will be?

02:56.170 --> 02:56.790
It will be long.

02:56.790 --> 03:01.440
And in the worst case scenario, Lewis will divide by two and give me the number of counts.

03:01.830 --> 03:04.230
I hope this is pretty easy for everyone.

03:05.550 --> 03:08.520
And what is the complexity of the whole call?

03:08.520 --> 03:10.290
The complexity of the whole record will be.

03:10.290 --> 03:13.080
And Logan said, this is the more serious part.

03:13.530 --> 03:13.680
What?

03:13.680 --> 03:14.730
I want you to do it.

03:17.290 --> 03:19.570
I want you to do something better than end Logan.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.640
And not just, you know, and Logan.

03:22.470 --> 03:23.100
Can you do it?

03:23.250 --> 03:24.630
And can you?

03:26.450 --> 03:27.500
Bring me the answer.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.090
In just over an.

03:30.120 --> 03:36.030
I just going over all these numbers once I just running one loop from 1 to 10 and not calling any other

03:36.030 --> 03:37.170
function or any other thing.

03:40.020 --> 03:40.580
Think about it.

03:40.830 --> 03:45.840
What I'm saying I'm saying that this brute force audition will take analog anytime because and for this

03:45.840 --> 03:51.840
particular area and login for this function to return me the number of Edwards but I want you to do

03:51.840 --> 03:54.240
it in off and complexity only.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.960
It off and complexity.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.330
How can we achieve the oil and complexity in this?

04:02.840 --> 04:05.700
It's before that you need to figure it out.

04:05.700 --> 04:10.910
And because of solution, because we know that if I'm able to find out or record this origin, which

04:11.290 --> 04:12.110
is something like this.

04:12.110 --> 04:19.940
FFI It depends on some f i only eight I tested see then it can easily be computed it in orphan.

04:20.310 --> 04:24.050
They will be recording it, will simply memorize it and it can easily be computed.

04:25.310 --> 04:28.430
How can I find out this particular recursive solution?

04:28.970 --> 04:33.740
So the answer lies in this answer lies in all these pairs here.

04:33.740 --> 04:34.280
So let me.

04:35.150 --> 04:35.420
Okay.

04:36.080 --> 04:36.860
This is a bear.

04:38.150 --> 04:44.170
Which is listed and then what is X and in spirit is x and to do you have to see the similarity between

04:44.170 --> 04:44.650
x.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.320
Binary and ex into two is binary eight.

04:48.990 --> 04:52.110
So do we all know about left shift operatives?

04:53.180 --> 04:56.380
Let me like quickly loose some extra knowledge.

04:56.390 --> 05:02.120
Of course this is not a but just for you can connect to it I mean.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.770
So what is left here appropriate to.

05:07.310 --> 05:13.190
The left shift the bets by the number of digits we tell them to basically retrieve.

05:15.190 --> 05:20.290
If I see three leaf shift one time.

05:20.740 --> 05:21.580
What does this mean?

05:21.880 --> 05:22.640
The binary of three.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.010
This and left should will.

05:24.010 --> 05:28.480
Just what it will do is it will shift those two it to the left of it.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.430
Basically it will become 110.

05:30.430 --> 05:33.970
And what is 1108 is nothing but x.

05:35.230 --> 05:41.680
So basically if I leave shift anything, let's say X left shift one times it is nothing but equal to

05:41.680 --> 05:42.310
x into two.

05:44.150 --> 05:51.080
Eight because the values left shifting and what is now shifting right shifting is nothing but x divided

05:51.080 --> 05:51.890
by two.

05:52.340 --> 05:57.680
And you can easily see if I left shift three, but if I had eight shift three by one doing so.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.510
Do you have to raise this?

05:59.510 --> 06:06.020
And if I shifted, then I will only be left with one one and the last one will just go what was binaries

06:06.020 --> 06:06.950
when it is one?

06:07.070 --> 06:08.840
So you can try on these pairs.

06:09.170 --> 06:15.850
Let's take two pairs leipsic firing and so let's let's do a five lecture one time.

06:15.860 --> 06:20.840
So if I'm doing lecture and James, I'm just I'll just apply a large zero and this is nothing but and

06:20.840 --> 06:25.280
as you can see the binary of ten and what is ten right shift.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.270
One thing it is nothing but I.

06:28.420 --> 06:30.820
Well, what I'll do is I'll simply.

06:32.230 --> 06:39.640
Former recursive solution here you're branding on the understanding that I've just formed which is that.

06:40.670 --> 06:44.660
Epiphany is nothing but deep of I buy two.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.890
It means the number of birds in I eight.

06:48.120 --> 06:53.540
If I'm talking about some number, I hear number of birds in I is close to number of birds in I about

06:53.540 --> 06:53.930
two.

06:54.890 --> 06:55.340
Plus.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.880
So here, I want you to finish this by yourself.

06:58.880 --> 06:59.900
Of course I'll be telling it.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.140
Let's see the relation.

07:02.450 --> 07:04.640
So if I have, I will do.

07:04.640 --> 07:05.330
Which is let's.

07:05.420 --> 07:06.650
Let's call it a random number.

07:06.650 --> 07:08.210
So let's add this is able to.

07:09.310 --> 07:11.380
So if I multiplied by two, what does it mean?

07:11.390 --> 07:12.640
I'm lifting it by one.

07:12.970 --> 07:14.320
I would, basically.

07:15.330 --> 07:18.050
The number of digits tonight is a cluster number of digits.

07:18.050 --> 07:19.850
And I will do the last bit.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.490
How do we determine the last word, guys?

07:22.820 --> 07:25.160
What is the last bit of the present?

07:25.700 --> 07:26.630
Just think about this.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.040
These are better than again.

07:30.280 --> 07:33.730
I just took this question for some educational perspective on.

07:35.730 --> 07:38.770
Because this will tell us a lot about life shifting, right?

07:38.770 --> 07:44.550
Shifting divided between multiplying by two and the last words, especially about the last words, which,

07:45.180 --> 07:48.840
as we can see, every alternate number has the last word said.

07:49.230 --> 07:51.150
This is nothing but our numbers.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.520
Every order number will have the.

07:56.090 --> 07:58.340
This thing last bit, said eight.

07:58.800 --> 08:04.700
What I can do is I can simply say DPA is equal to DPA because those bits are same rate.

08:05.220 --> 08:08.990
Basically if I live here by okay, let me live shifted by.

08:09.620 --> 08:09.860
Yeah.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.170
So this will be the left shifting of the particular.

08:13.330 --> 08:13.960
This is X.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.290
This is X in two eight.

08:16.510 --> 08:18.310
And what will be the last word here?

08:18.640 --> 08:22.900
What will be the last word of the X by two of x two?

08:22.930 --> 08:27.080
It is nothing, but it will depend whether x is a.

08:28.350 --> 08:31.950
Even so, of course, Xanadu will always be one eight.

08:31.950 --> 08:34.470
But I'm just saying that if I want to formulate.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.990
This particular addition, which is DPA as you go through DPA, where to place?

08:42.500 --> 08:44.700
Are they a bodyguard?

08:44.880 --> 08:46.680
If I is out, it will give us one.

08:46.710 --> 08:48.400
Otherwise, it will give us zero.

08:48.420 --> 08:50.640
That means the last bit of eight.

08:51.090 --> 08:52.830
So this is a symbolic relation.

08:52.830 --> 08:55.020
So let's try to fill the whole area with this.

08:55.950 --> 08:56.550
Me Right.

09:01.510 --> 09:05.860
Well, as I said, DPA, literally all the DPA is over here.

09:07.060 --> 09:12.010
For one, what will be the solution would be one is to go through DPA one by two, which is zero.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.970
8240 Litchfield zero.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.900
Because we know the it's a base case unless it's Barnard.

09:19.090 --> 09:21.570
Yes, but wasn't it zero plus one.

09:22.280 --> 09:28.560
Well, so deep two is equal to DP one because two veterans, one need to be with.

09:28.590 --> 09:29.490
It goes to DP one.

09:29.490 --> 09:33.160
Plus, whether it is art or not, it's not out all.

09:33.510 --> 09:34.340
How much will it be?

09:34.350 --> 09:36.720
Quality will be equal to one in the DP.

09:36.720 --> 09:37.080
Three.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.890
If poetry goes too deep.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.270
Ubuntu is one less.

09:43.760 --> 09:44.930
Whether to resort or not.

09:44.960 --> 09:49.790
Yes, it is hard, but basically it will be true because DP when we have already found which is fine.

09:50.840 --> 09:55.910
So in this way we can just, you know, go once over this whole area and keep on printing the element.

09:57.190 --> 09:57.430
Right.

09:57.570 --> 10:00.330
So let me just go ahead very quickly.

10:01.530 --> 10:03.270
That's N is equal to ten.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.600
It's say I was from.

10:12.690 --> 10:13.200
Wonderland.

10:13.200 --> 10:13.500
Right.

10:14.190 --> 10:14.580
So.

10:16.490 --> 10:28.570
It's have Eddie called DP and let's see it and plus one lend DP zero is initially 000 and I'm acting

10:28.590 --> 10:30.660
in Brisbane because I'm printing Dillon.

10:31.490 --> 10:34.490
What I'll do is simply DPA is equal to DP.

10:34.730 --> 10:35.570
I buy two.

10:36.860 --> 10:38.090
Let's now.

10:39.210 --> 10:42.090
I mean, it has been shifted, right?

10:42.090 --> 10:46.650
So I Abbott has been left shifted and I have to decide whether the last word is set or not.

10:47.190 --> 10:50.580
How can I decide if I'm able to?

10:52.430 --> 10:55.520
So if if it is an odd number, it will give us one.

10:55.520 --> 10:59.570
If it is an even number, then it will give me zero eight.

11:00.170 --> 11:01.970
So simply I'll just print this out.

11:02.140 --> 11:02.570
eBay.

11:03.610 --> 11:04.540
And let's build it.

11:06.330 --> 11:06.780
Also.

11:06.780 --> 11:08.340
One, one, two.

11:08.370 --> 11:09.870
One, two, two, three.

11:09.900 --> 11:10.590
One, two, two.

11:12.400 --> 11:19.330
So as you can see, the complexity of this solution is not woven only and not even off and log in because

11:19.330 --> 11:24.970
we have simply find out some pattern in the recursive relation and we have found this recursively and

11:24.970 --> 11:26.020
this is a negative relation.

11:26.290 --> 11:33.250
The DPA 1120 by means you'll be able to place I'm not I MOTU is whether it is even or.

11:34.390 --> 11:34.870
Will raise.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.450
So I hope you understood this.

11:37.690 --> 11:38.460
Thank you, everyone.

11:38.470 --> 11:39.550
And in the next part.
