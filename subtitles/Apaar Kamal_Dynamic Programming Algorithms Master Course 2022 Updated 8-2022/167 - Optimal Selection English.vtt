00:00.600 --> 00:01.350
Hello, everyone.

00:01.470 --> 00:07.020
Let's dig deeper into deep with Musk, starting from this particular problem, and then we'll move on

00:07.020 --> 00:08.820
to some more beautiful problems.

00:09.570 --> 00:12.930
So this problem says, okay, let's do this problem first.

00:13.710 --> 00:19.090
So the problem statement is, as a first example, consider the following problem.

00:19.110 --> 00:19.590
Okay.

00:19.860 --> 00:22.620
We are given the prices of key products or warranties.

00:23.430 --> 00:25.500
So here we have products we can see.

00:27.110 --> 00:27.350
Yeah.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.460
These are the products and these are base.

00:31.220 --> 00:33.860
So we have gay products and we have the prizes for entries.

00:33.890 --> 00:40.730
So here and there too that these are starting from zero eight and we want to buy each product exactly

00:40.730 --> 00:41.120
once.

00:41.270 --> 00:42.660
This is important too.

00:42.680 --> 00:47.120
I just want to buy each product exactly once, right after I buy it on the first day or the second day

00:47.120 --> 00:50.810
of the third day or the four day so unrelenting and minus one day.

00:50.810 --> 00:51.110
Right?

00:51.470 --> 00:54.540
So however, we are not allowed to buy at most one product generic.

00:55.010 --> 00:59.960
So in one day I can buy only zero or one product.

01:00.290 --> 01:02.750
That means at most one product I can buy inventory.

01:03.020 --> 01:06.290
For example, here you can see for day if I don't have any products.

01:06.620 --> 01:11.980
Right, and then I'll not buy a product in a day or I'll buy at most one product for 99.

01:12.200 --> 01:16.520
But the point is, we want to buy each product exactly once, right?

01:16.550 --> 01:18.410
So you cannot buy any product twice.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.320
So what is the minimum price?

01:21.320 --> 01:23.660
For example, consider the following scenario.

01:23.690 --> 01:24.800
Guess to the end is it?

01:25.740 --> 01:28.620
So we can see if case three the product has 012.

01:28.890 --> 01:29.620
So it's good, right?

01:29.650 --> 01:35.580
There's the production name from the European Index, so we will not confuse recording them and the

01:35.580 --> 01:36.300
dates are there.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.880
So these are the prices, right?

01:38.130 --> 01:40.000
So let's say these are price.

01:40.020 --> 01:41.550
This this table is prices.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.470
Prices, let's say x commodity.

01:46.010 --> 01:52.100
What will price ex commodity present the price of the product on the pool?

01:52.340 --> 01:55.790
So if I say what is price of zero?

01:56.730 --> 02:03.900
And that means for the price of zero to product on 50.

02:04.990 --> 02:05.250
Right.

02:05.470 --> 02:07.270
That means it is not good.

02:08.110 --> 02:10.770
So some small infusions.

02:10.870 --> 02:11.620
Let's clear them.

02:11.950 --> 02:16.990
And after this, we can see that in this scenario, the million dollar price is fake.

02:17.650 --> 02:18.420
So this is true.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.130
This is true.

02:19.150 --> 02:20.650
This is one correct.

02:21.100 --> 02:25.990
That means the total price of buying three products such that no, no.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.600
Two products are bought in the same day.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.880
And we have bought exactly one.

02:31.660 --> 02:34.720
Each of the product have been bought exactly once.

02:35.020 --> 02:35.350
Right.

02:35.740 --> 02:41.980
So according to this, the total price, the minimum price that we can have to buy these products is.

02:43.110 --> 02:43.360
Five.

02:43.740 --> 02:44.880
I hope this is very clear.

02:45.240 --> 02:55.680
However, we are vying for the gun on the first read zero 23 and Berdych 26 C although we had one here,

02:55.680 --> 02:59.010
that is the minimum of the product zero.

02:59.010 --> 03:03.930
It is the minimum rate, but we cannot get two ones on the same day.

03:03.930 --> 03:06.780
Basically, we cannot buy these two products on day six.

03:06.780 --> 03:07.110
Right.

03:07.350 --> 03:10.380
So on day six, I have to weigh only one verdict.

03:10.830 --> 03:14.730
So why don't you all try some approaches in this and see your answers here?

03:15.420 --> 03:15.700
Okay.

03:16.560 --> 03:21.270
So of course, any of the greedy approaches won't work, right?

03:21.270 --> 03:27.090
So the first greedy approach can be very simple for product zero, try the smallest, then for product

03:27.090 --> 03:28.800
one, get the smallest if.

03:29.220 --> 03:32.720
If that is already picked, try the second smallest rate.

03:32.940 --> 03:34.980
So here the smallest is two.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.600
So we have one, two, three twos.

03:36.780 --> 03:42.690
So let's pick any, let's pick this two and then forward it to try the smallest of the smallest one.

03:42.690 --> 03:43.890
But this is already paid.

03:44.460 --> 03:45.780
The day six is already.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.400
I'm just trying a greedy approach here.

03:47.820 --> 03:51.810
Where does the second smallest they the second smallest here will be three rate.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.060
So here I am going to replace two plus one with just six.

03:54.060 --> 03:55.860
But which is not the right answer.

03:55.860 --> 04:00.120
Right as we saw, five is the best answer in this current scenario.

04:02.220 --> 04:06.150
So, yeah, this this this is about B.

04:07.240 --> 04:07.510
Yeah.

04:07.600 --> 04:11.410
So this is about this small, simple, very good problem.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.140
And then what we'll do is we'll simply move on to.

04:15.020 --> 04:17.540
Some good dynamic programming solution, right?

04:17.810 --> 04:26.610
So can I apply something like knapsack here that either buy the product on that day or don't buy it

04:26.720 --> 04:27.040
made?

04:29.210 --> 04:30.140
Is that possible?

04:30.680 --> 04:31.140
Yes.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.920
So we just work exactly like knapsack.

04:34.280 --> 04:37.820
But just the thing here is that we have to optimize that using bit mass.

04:38.240 --> 04:38.420
Okay.

04:38.690 --> 04:39.500
So what else is.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.050
I'll simply say I'll just make a straight call F of.

04:44.650 --> 04:44.820
Uh.

04:44.920 --> 04:45.820
Let's see.

04:48.180 --> 04:49.890
It's gonna be.

04:50.820 --> 04:50.970
Eight.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.220
So here is a subset.

04:54.170 --> 04:58.610
Is a subset or s is a set rate and liquidated.

05:01.190 --> 05:04.890
As is a set and visa rate.

05:05.210 --> 05:08.900
So what I would say is what is F of S comedy is implicitly diverse.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.960
Comedy is nothing but the minimum.

05:14.090 --> 05:15.080
Minimum price.

05:16.150 --> 05:16.630
Of.

05:18.370 --> 05:22.270
This sentence contains some particular products in them, right?

05:22.480 --> 05:28.210
So the set right now for this example, this said can either contain zero one or two or can contain

05:28.210 --> 05:29.470
0102.

05:29.770 --> 05:33.610
So basically this subset of zero went to a subset of products.

05:34.030 --> 05:35.260
So F.

05:35.260 --> 05:38.470
S committee will represent minimum price of the.

05:39.450 --> 05:41.220
Said s products.

05:42.540 --> 05:42.930
Right.

05:44.750 --> 05:45.350
Until.

05:47.700 --> 05:48.060
They?

05:49.010 --> 05:50.140
Be right.

05:50.480 --> 05:56.570
So what is the minimum price of these products for the baby, for a particular sect?

05:57.080 --> 05:58.400
For example, let's say the.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.130
Okay, let's let me make.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.200
Let me just say, what is the final answer?

06:03.210 --> 06:05.930
What will be the final answer that we need here?

06:05.990 --> 06:10.130
If I talk about this particular deep state, the final answer here is.

06:11.180 --> 06:11.690
In this ad.

06:11.700 --> 06:12.710
I want all the products.

06:14.570 --> 06:14.840
Right.

06:15.890 --> 06:17.430
And that they will be in minus.

06:18.890 --> 06:20.600
So this is the final answer that I need.

06:20.660 --> 06:27.860
That is, all the products should be bought and the last days and minus for you to tell me for all these

06:27.860 --> 06:32.900
and minus one days, if I combine them, what is the minimum price of the products that I'm going to

06:32.900 --> 06:34.790
buy which are in the said?

06:36.260 --> 06:37.400
I hope this is clear.

06:37.960 --> 06:38.120
Okay.

06:38.390 --> 06:44.030
So let's start from this final answer and let's see what other TV states that we need you.

06:44.540 --> 06:44.840
Right.

06:45.170 --> 06:49.220
So if I have 012 in and minus one, I have three production and minus one days.

06:49.550 --> 06:54.680
So what's the approach that I can prefer to reach and minus one date?

06:55.040 --> 06:55.940
The first thing is.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.750
I don't buy anything on the large state aid.

06:59.930 --> 07:00.600
I cannot.

07:00.650 --> 07:02.840
The first option there, Davis, don't buy.

07:03.960 --> 07:04.380
On.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.670
Instead of an minus one.

07:09.690 --> 07:10.330
Okay, let.

07:10.350 --> 07:10.630
Let's.

07:10.630 --> 07:11.970
Let's rein it in, Mason.

07:12.420 --> 07:13.770
Don't buy on.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.220
And minus one day.

07:16.700 --> 07:16.960
Right.

07:17.150 --> 07:21.200
So if I don't buy any of these products on that minus one day, that means I've already bought them

07:21.200 --> 07:21.550
earlier.

07:22.010 --> 07:22.310
Right.

07:22.460 --> 07:25.430
So the answer will depend simply on zero.

07:25.490 --> 07:26.690
The set will remain the same.

07:26.690 --> 07:30.000
Set will not change because I'm not buying any product on the last day.

07:30.020 --> 07:33.380
But that means I have to buy the one.

07:33.650 --> 07:36.970
I have to buy all of these products on days before eight.

07:37.010 --> 07:38.570
So here I'll make it and minus two.

07:39.230 --> 07:39.470
Okay.

07:39.470 --> 07:43.870
Now tell me, for the previous days for this product, what's the best answer rate?

07:44.350 --> 07:46.220
What are other options that I have?

07:47.180 --> 07:50.180
Because we can buy only one product in one day, right?

07:50.330 --> 07:52.520
So let's say I'm buying this product.

07:53.770 --> 07:54.850
On the end minus one.

07:55.320 --> 07:55.650
Right.

07:55.660 --> 08:00.460
So if I'm buying the zero two right on the end -20, then what's made a good insulation that.

08:00.460 --> 08:05.080
Okay now I said contains one in two only because I'm buying the zeroth product on the end minus one

08:05.080 --> 08:05.500
the right.

08:05.860 --> 08:10.360
So tell me what's the best answer if I just if I have to buy one comma two.

08:10.360 --> 08:14.020
There is this set of products which contain only product one and product two.

08:14.500 --> 08:22.300
And for the previous 10 minutes to this plus prices of the price of not prices.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.800
Let's let me make it presently.

08:24.160 --> 08:29.440
Yeah and the price of this product that I bought on the end minus one today.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.000
So there's a price.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.190
Corruption is first verdict.

08:35.600 --> 08:40.070
What's the if I'm buying the first product on the last day, then it is simple.

08:40.610 --> 08:43.720
Zero comma two because I'm buying this verdict.

08:43.730 --> 08:49.250
One on the lacerated means I have to pay zero for this before because I cannot buy two products on the

08:49.250 --> 08:49.760
same day.

08:50.330 --> 08:55.880
And we have and minus two over here because we have to ask the answer for the previous days.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.300
This is price of zero, not zero.

08:58.310 --> 09:00.560
Now it will be one binding and minus.

09:01.870 --> 09:02.140
Do.

09:03.330 --> 09:03.690
Sorry.

09:03.820 --> 09:05.430
And minus eight.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.710
And the last option that I have is.

09:08.840 --> 09:09.540
Second product.

09:09.560 --> 09:15.340
Let's I'm buying this second product today on the last day and it will be zero comma one.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.930
Now, these are the set of products that you need to buy.

09:19.310 --> 09:24.530
Previously on the previous days, plus the price of the current product that I'm buying on today.

09:25.910 --> 09:26.180
Right.

09:26.330 --> 09:34.200
So whatever is the minimum of all these four items, I'll simply take that and including and my deposit

09:34.280 --> 09:34.600
rate.

09:34.850 --> 09:36.330
So whatever minimum this is.

09:36.350 --> 09:37.760
So what are the basic issues here?

09:38.690 --> 09:42.950
Ultimately, what's happening as other days reducing are the products that are doing right.

09:43.280 --> 09:47.690
So let's say if the products goes none, that means nil.

09:47.960 --> 09:48.320
Right.

09:48.650 --> 09:51.250
That means I'm not buying another zero, not one or two.

09:51.270 --> 09:52.340
This is empty.

09:52.490 --> 09:52.750
Right.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.180
So what is the cost of buying empty?

09:55.220 --> 09:58.610
Said product means not buying any product for any of the days.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.350
It is zero.

10:00.770 --> 10:01.070
Right.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.420
So if my set is empty.

10:02.810 --> 10:03.830
The answer should be zero.

10:03.860 --> 10:05.120
Because I'm not buying anything.

10:05.750 --> 10:06.320
And.

10:07.930 --> 10:13.330
The now disagreeing thing is adamant and is reducing or the days are reducing rate.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.400
So let's have some status.

10:15.400 --> 10:19.090
And that day here is zero eight.

10:19.450 --> 10:23.860
So what is the cost of buying some particular sectors on day zero?

10:24.520 --> 10:31.930
We all know the answer to this, that if this said because on day zero, I'm going to buy up a particular

10:31.930 --> 10:32.710
product, right?

10:32.890 --> 10:38.470
I cannot buy some subset of those products, but I can only buy one product of them.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.040
Right.

10:39.430 --> 10:48.910
So I simply say, if this said or let's let's see if as Dart's size, if s contains greater than one

10:48.910 --> 10:52.480
product, right, then the answer is zero otherwise.

10:54.580 --> 10:55.560
Then the answer is zero.

10:55.570 --> 10:59.880
That means I won't I'm not able to buy any of the products on them.

11:00.550 --> 11:05.380
I won't be able to buy any of the products because I'm on day zero and only the right cannot buy more

11:05.380 --> 11:05.980
than two products.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.170
Because that's only more than one product.

11:08.170 --> 11:08.960
Because there is only one.

11:09.490 --> 11:11.020
And the second is second thing.

11:11.020 --> 11:16.270
It is if as large say is one rate, then it is nothing.

11:16.270 --> 11:22.120
But it is equal to the price of that particular element in this set.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.990
The product that I'm going to buy and zero the last.

11:27.250 --> 11:33.400
But the first verdict so I have to guess is it only to these should be my best guesses and this should

11:33.400 --> 11:36.370
be my good deep reconciliation.

11:36.830 --> 11:40.720
So I hope you understood how I am getting snagged here.

11:40.730 --> 11:41.050
Right.

11:41.230 --> 11:42.340
I have to pass said.

11:42.730 --> 11:43.480
I have to make it.

11:43.490 --> 11:44.380
I have to pass it.

11:44.800 --> 11:48.880
And we all know what's the best optimization for passing this.

11:50.460 --> 11:50.840
Okay.

11:51.330 --> 11:57.930
Let me first quickly generalize these definitions to F of s comma.

11:58.590 --> 12:01.680
Some particular d is equal to minimum of.

12:02.850 --> 12:05.760
F off Eskom I'd be minus one.

12:05.760 --> 12:11.130
That means I'm not buying any of the item, any of the product on the current de gamma.

12:12.240 --> 12:15.870
The minimum of F of S.

12:15.870 --> 12:19.890
Let's remove that product X from this and see that.

12:19.890 --> 12:22.920
Tell me what's the best answer of buying it for the previous days?

12:23.400 --> 12:28.710
Plus price off that product X on b b minus oh.

12:28.710 --> 12:32.370
So on the D on the right, no minus here.

12:33.150 --> 12:41.010
So the product of the price of Burgundy, right and this X for this will go for all the X the all the

12:41.010 --> 12:41.430
products.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.030
Right.

12:42.300 --> 12:47.700
So if I just want to drive it because of course we want to read it of masking, right.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.500
We don't want to work with set here.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.070
Right.

12:50.280 --> 12:53.190
So what will happen ultimately on the last day?

12:53.490 --> 12:54.240
What will happen?

12:54.420 --> 12:58.470
The set should be this because we have three products, eight for three products.

12:58.470 --> 13:02.970
I just need to reboot, which is to destroy about three minus one, which is seven, correct?

13:04.330 --> 13:06.160
So here, what I have is I have seven.

13:07.770 --> 13:08.250
Bomber.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.450
And the last day.

13:09.450 --> 13:10.290
What is the last day?

13:11.370 --> 13:11.760
Okay.

13:12.540 --> 13:13.830
The last day is.

13:15.010 --> 13:17.770
778 to the last day.

13:17.770 --> 13:20.080
Seven evolve, seven seven will be mine.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.490
So why is this seven here?

13:21.520 --> 13:23.350
Because this represents a big must now.

13:24.680 --> 13:24.990
Eight.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.250
Because seven.

13:26.270 --> 13:28.180
If I represented in binary simple white.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.090
So it will represent.

13:29.300 --> 13:35.030
This represents the verdict first verdict and the second product verdict and.

13:35.390 --> 13:35.660
Yeah.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.320
So cool.

13:38.540 --> 13:41.270
And what I would say is I will simply say that.

13:43.210 --> 13:45.490
These states really depend on the four states.

13:45.580 --> 13:46.720
What are those four states?

13:47.960 --> 13:49.250
First is don't buy the product.

13:49.640 --> 13:55.130
So if I'm not going to buy all three products, which is still seven from day six and be on eight.

13:55.790 --> 13:57.620
The second one will be by.

13:59.930 --> 14:00.970
So this is seven eight.

14:01.310 --> 14:03.460
Let's remove this zero verdict from this.

14:03.470 --> 14:04.700
Let's answer this bit.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.730
So if I answered this bill but I didn't get this, I get 1108.

14:08.900 --> 14:09.230
So.

14:10.530 --> 14:12.810
Just by this verdict on day seven.

14:13.100 --> 14:13.370
Right.

14:13.380 --> 14:17.970
So just tell me the best answer for buying other new products, which is product one and product two

14:18.120 --> 14:24.840
on the previous days, rate plus price of zero verdict on day seven.

14:25.350 --> 14:25.770
Correct.

14:26.190 --> 14:30.300
And the next one will be a4101, which is.

14:31.080 --> 14:31.410
Okay.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.640
So here I wrote seven.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.820
So here I just said six.

14:36.300 --> 14:36.540
Cool.

14:36.540 --> 14:37.830
Because 1106.

14:37.950 --> 14:42.210
So instead of writing 101, let me just write the actual numbers.

14:42.420 --> 14:45.300
So we all know seven is 1116 is 101.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.510
And here we're are delegate delegate one zero.

14:49.660 --> 14:50.050
Okay.

14:50.530 --> 14:51.460
It is 110.

14:53.270 --> 14:54.980
So here it is.

14:55.220 --> 14:56.780
It is about the first protection movement.

14:56.820 --> 15:01.580
So if I remove the middle bird from seven, I get 101, which is nothing but five eight.

15:01.760 --> 15:05.060
So and four five gonna be the six year plus price of.

15:06.230 --> 15:07.940
The first brought out R&amp;B.

15:08.240 --> 15:08.690
Seven.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.170
So why are you here?

15:10.190 --> 15:11.360
Because it is 101.

15:11.360 --> 15:15.050
That means I'm buying the first version last year and the next one is F of.

15:16.390 --> 15:18.370
Now remove the first bit.

15:18.640 --> 15:23.920
That means remove the second product trade, remove the second product, the bit becomes 011, which

15:23.920 --> 15:26.260
is nothing but three eight.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.870
So tell me the best answer of buying.

15:30.380 --> 15:30.700
To be.

15:30.950 --> 15:35.630
That means not to be buying product zero and product one from the previous days.

15:36.050 --> 15:37.040
Less price of.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.440
Two, comma seven.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.650
I hope you're getting this right, because now this is very simple.

15:44.370 --> 15:47.380
All the said I am representing all deserters.

15:47.400 --> 15:51.930
Big must write bearer seven includes zero verdict, first verdict and second verdict.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.550
This is three.

15:53.550 --> 15:56.540
Three includes only the verdict and first verdict, not the second quarter.

15:56.590 --> 15:57.900
Because it's a bit, isn't it?

15:58.620 --> 15:58.870
Right.

15:59.640 --> 16:03.540
So here you can see that was the relation that I'm getting.

16:03.540 --> 16:04.790
The relation is very simple.

16:05.220 --> 16:06.090
The relation is.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.140
Net for any seven.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.420
I have to try these three possibilities.

16:10.660 --> 16:14.800
That is 011101 and 110.

16:14.920 --> 16:15.340
Correct.

16:15.820 --> 16:16.510
For these.

16:16.510 --> 16:17.450
How will these be?

16:17.450 --> 16:18.220
It must be made.

16:18.250 --> 16:22.780
These weird ones will be made by 001010.

16:23.420 --> 16:23.680
Right.

16:23.860 --> 16:25.660
Because here tributes were sent.

16:25.660 --> 16:27.220
So we had three possibilities.

16:27.580 --> 16:27.910
Correct.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.030
Now we have two, which so we will have two possibilities.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.760
But that's how factories work, if you remember.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.060
Right.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.700
So it is three into two.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.600
Into one.

16:38.080 --> 16:38.350
Right.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.070
Let me just.

16:40.120 --> 16:40.870
No, they don't.

16:41.470 --> 16:41.730
Yeah.

16:41.740 --> 16:44.490
So this gives me 001.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.060
This gives me 100.

16:46.060 --> 16:50.800
And the last one is 100 and.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.780
0108.

16:54.200 --> 16:57.170
Finally, this will all this will come from zero.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.520
This will also come from zero.

16:59.600 --> 16:59.990
I'm just.

16:59.990 --> 17:02.480
I'm just sharing you hard as it must work.

17:02.490 --> 17:06.020
How does it reduce factorial due to rest of the power in.

17:07.020 --> 17:07.290
Right.

17:07.470 --> 17:10.790
So here you can see I started from one eight.

17:11.100 --> 17:12.630
Now this row has three columns.

17:12.630 --> 17:12.900
There it is.

17:12.900 --> 17:19.230
And the three happened because of attribute said no, I'm just removing one word from or one word from

17:19.230 --> 17:19.740
this might.

17:19.800 --> 17:23.190
That means I'm getting 011101 and 1101 just to the right.

17:23.520 --> 17:30.690
Now, I'll remove exactly one bit from this means I want to find out how can I make 011 and then I can

17:30.690 --> 17:30.960
add.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.550
Melbourne to this.

17:33.790 --> 17:36.550
Or I can add last one to this.

17:36.550 --> 17:36.840
Correct.

17:36.850 --> 17:38.140
Only two possible options.

17:39.140 --> 17:44.480
So here you can see now the number of notes however, are six registering to do.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.050
I hope you understand why I do.

17:46.070 --> 17:47.200
Because there are two bits.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.900
And now this six in one, which is six.

17:51.390 --> 17:56.710
So here you can see that there are some overlapping mass, right?

17:56.900 --> 17:58.550
That means here you can see that this.

17:58.550 --> 18:00.260
01001.

18:01.660 --> 18:12.160
Below overlap with the 001 and 010 is overlapping with 010 and this 100 is overlapping with 10088.

18:12.490 --> 18:16.000
Although these dates are going in effect to real order, right?

18:16.030 --> 18:17.340
It is going into three.

18:17.350 --> 18:18.550
It is going into two.

18:18.790 --> 18:21.370
If I talk about 16, let's talk about 16.

18:22.540 --> 18:28.900
Please pardon me if the video is long, but it's important to understand that it is 16.

18:29.080 --> 18:32.150
Now we know it will be divided into four parts, right?

18:32.200 --> 18:34.600
01111011.

18:37.260 --> 18:39.510
11011110.

18:39.990 --> 18:41.760
Now this will be divided into three parts.

18:43.620 --> 18:43.980
Right.

18:44.910 --> 18:47.220
And then those will be divided into two parts.

18:51.880 --> 18:52.270
Correct.

18:53.290 --> 18:55.270
And then further, those are adhering to one part.

18:55.420 --> 19:00.940
So it is in the food industry in the two into one, which is nothing but food factory.

19:01.210 --> 19:03.460
Here we can see we have four factories, states.

19:03.730 --> 19:04.950
But what will happen?

19:04.960 --> 19:06.880
There will be some states which will be.

19:07.960 --> 19:16.690
Rebuilding viable some states with rebuilding because all these states are between 0 to 2 days to the

19:16.690 --> 19:18.430
power and minus one.

19:18.430 --> 19:20.570
And here is the number of bids made.

19:20.800 --> 19:26.860
So if all the states are in, so if the total number of states are only to restore the power in, then

19:27.130 --> 19:31.300
and I'm seeing that the number of different states that I'm making is four factorial, then there will

19:31.300 --> 19:33.040
be some states which will be repeating.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.120
Correct.

19:34.660 --> 19:40.270
For example, if I have four factorial states, which is nothing but forward into trained to do is 24.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.280
And what is to list above one minus one?

19:42.280 --> 19:45.220
It is alleged to it is above what if I include zero?

19:45.610 --> 19:46.390
It is 16.

19:46.930 --> 19:54.070
So I have 16 distinct states here because all the values of these behemoths will be between 0 to 15.

19:54.340 --> 19:54.730
Correct.

19:55.000 --> 20:01.210
If all the values will be zero 15 and I have 24 different states, that means 24 times I'm calling things.

20:01.240 --> 20:05.530
There will be some states which will be coming again and again, which will be repeating.

20:06.130 --> 20:09.670
So just to avoid those repetitions, what we'll do is we will memorize it.

20:12.030 --> 20:12.320
Right.

20:12.540 --> 20:15.630
So this was an important part to understand it.

20:15.630 --> 20:20.520
How is or resolution converting converted into power to restore the power installation.

20:21.300 --> 20:24.220
Because there are some students contributing eight.

20:25.340 --> 20:32.420
That means we can have at most four factory estates, but there will be a total to restore the power

20:32.420 --> 20:32.960
in states.

20:33.390 --> 20:33.710
Correct.

20:33.710 --> 20:37.690
And if I just calculate all these states ones, then I don't have to find figured out.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.520
Well, other states would.

20:41.420 --> 20:42.710
So I hope you understood this.

20:43.430 --> 20:45.020
Factorial too.

20:46.890 --> 20:51.060
Factorial to do this to the power in.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.820
Well and since the next fight.
