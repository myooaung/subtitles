00:01.080 --> 00:03.060
Everyone, welcome back.

00:03.180 --> 00:06.240
And this is a very interesting problem.

00:06.840 --> 00:13.170
It is longest common subsequent and el-Sisi's actually longest comments wins only.

00:13.500 --> 00:18.900
But sometimes what happens is people referred to earlier this longest common upstream.

00:21.090 --> 00:21.870
But that's not true.

00:22.230 --> 00:22.520
Right.

00:23.850 --> 00:27.870
Or what you always doing is you're going to always come from the other person as they are talking about

00:27.870 --> 00:31.410
subsequent or substring because subsequent is different from substring.

00:31.410 --> 00:31.980
We all know that.

00:31.980 --> 00:32.240
Right?

00:32.610 --> 00:33.660
Let's quickly go with it.

00:34.590 --> 00:35.520
What is the substring?

00:36.770 --> 00:38.420
It is a continuous piece of characters.

00:38.940 --> 00:43.070
Subsequent may not be continuous, but they are ordered is of characters.

00:44.060 --> 00:47.900
So let's if I was doing ABC, how many such things will be there?

00:48.410 --> 00:50.420
It triggered something starting from me.

00:50.840 --> 00:59.060
E ab ABC thing starting from b, b, b, c and from C to see that we have total X of strength.

00:59.070 --> 00:59.360
Right?

00:59.660 --> 01:06.380
It means there are and substring starting from here and minus one substring starting from b and and

01:06.380 --> 01:12.170
minus two substring starting from C basically it is and and my husband and so until zero so the summation

01:12.170 --> 01:17.870
is and then plus one way to Rachel we have these we need total substring file for the subsequent is

01:18.170 --> 01:22.340
it's the string is there ABC we have up sequences of length.

01:22.340 --> 01:24.110
One subsequent is of land to.

01:25.370 --> 01:30.230
And subsequently the land, sea and subsequent land zero are also the empty string.

01:31.190 --> 01:37.910
So you can see you see also subsequent various is he was not the upstream because it's not continuous.

01:38.450 --> 01:41.690
I hope this difference between subsequent and substring is very clear.

01:43.230 --> 01:45.690
Now let's talk about the problem.

01:46.750 --> 01:52.280
The problem says find the longest common subsequent eight or subsequent is the other one eight.

01:52.300 --> 01:54.010
So how many subsequent is are there race?

01:54.430 --> 01:56.650
There are two race for the boat and subsequent is how?

01:57.220 --> 02:00.250
Because all three characters have two options.

02:00.340 --> 02:03.790
Eight added they will come in the subsequent or did not come in the subsequent.

02:03.970 --> 02:08.950
Two options for their two options for be two options for see the total to enter doing to do it.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.390
Options eight.

02:11.600 --> 02:15.820
So similarly in this similar fashion, we'll solve this problem.

02:16.350 --> 02:18.290
We have these two things.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.610
Let me quickly write them.

02:20.870 --> 02:21.140
Okay.

02:21.140 --> 02:21.920
Let's, uh.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.200
Yeah, let's give an example.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.640
Only it'd be a.

02:28.170 --> 02:31.200
Eight and the other is b, c, double B.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.200
So what is the longest common subsequent object?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.490
If you can.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.700
So here it is.

02:39.240 --> 02:39.600
Be.

02:40.960 --> 02:41.310
Be.

02:42.160 --> 02:47.080
And this be it or the other can be instead of having this be.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.520
We could also.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.620
We could also have this thing to do this and this.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.810
This is the longest possible moments of sequence of body.

03:00.220 --> 03:00.550
Things.

03:01.660 --> 03:02.380
Just tell me.

03:02.590 --> 03:04.540
What if we had a CEO with you?

03:04.690 --> 03:06.760
And what had it been for?

03:06.760 --> 03:15.280
And the longest comment subsequent or no they fire because the auto matters this be matches with this

03:15.280 --> 03:19.090
be this be matches with this be this be matches with this be.

03:19.370 --> 03:24.550
But now we cannot, you know, match this C to the see because the order matters.

03:25.990 --> 03:29.860
So if see would have been here, then they would have meshed together.

03:30.400 --> 03:30.600
They.

03:31.970 --> 03:32.940
I hope this is clear.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.890
The order matters.

03:34.490 --> 03:37.100
You cannot ignore that kind of.

03:38.960 --> 03:39.260
Yeah.

03:39.590 --> 03:42.410
Now, let's think about their dining room solution.

03:42.660 --> 03:44.210
So how do we always begin?

03:44.240 --> 03:51.410
We always begin by placing an eight point and joint area, and we see that we make a state that f of

03:51.410 --> 04:02.210
i go my j is nothing but alcaeus of e starting from a who end and b starting from j to.

04:04.680 --> 04:05.250
Denise.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.720
I hope this part is very clear.

04:08.020 --> 04:10.210
I'm just a lot more vigorous anymore.

04:10.210 --> 04:12.280
I just retired eight.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.440
Well, tell me, what options do E?

04:18.070 --> 04:25.870
And this business model options are the best option is whether this will be in the subsequent or it

04:25.870 --> 04:27.340
will not be in the subsequent rate.

04:27.670 --> 04:30.070
There are two cases, as always, if.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.020
Easy.

04:32.030 --> 04:32.870
It was too busy.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.700
First thing is to very simply bow.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.700
The characters are seem a little.

04:36.860 --> 04:37.970
But the characters were the same.

04:37.970 --> 04:44.990
Let's see if there was a B over here and I'm trying to match both these B and then the answer is nothing,

04:44.990 --> 04:47.090
but it will be nothing but one.

04:47.090 --> 04:53.210
Plus, whatever is the best subsequent find, the longest common subsequent from the rest of the string.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.620
Read Next of the string.

04:54.740 --> 04:55.890
What is the rest of the string?

04:55.890 --> 04:58.510
Here it is a plus one comma j plus one.

05:00.130 --> 05:00.610
Will these.

05:02.170 --> 05:07.600
I hope this is very clear when both of them are equal to Trump biscuits the normal case.

05:08.500 --> 05:15.170
But when both of them are not equal, what options he has, he has an option that I will not go in subsequent

05:15.190 --> 05:16.060
than eight.

05:16.210 --> 05:23.140
Then find the best subsequent which is starting from a plus one to end and be doing so.

05:23.350 --> 05:26.020
In this case, we can always sit there day by day.

05:26.740 --> 05:27.670
It's equal to.

05:28.690 --> 05:31.030
EPA Gomer Pyle DB A-plus.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.590
When committee which is.

05:33.800 --> 05:41.220
The best from the others or the securing option that is don't include being these applicants don't downbeat

05:41.220 --> 05:48.110
right if I'm not including this be in the subsequent the g part then simply is find the best subsequent

05:48.110 --> 05:51.350
from the plus when doing and i i doing.

05:51.350 --> 05:52.940
Because this I will still be there.

05:53.690 --> 05:53.940
Eight.

05:56.640 --> 06:04.140
AP, former NDP icon, be less fun and will they simply max of them?

06:05.160 --> 06:08.790
So there's also a third option, but that's a return and option.

06:08.940 --> 06:15.330
I mean, that will be handled indirectly and that is very important to understand there, to take some

06:15.330 --> 06:16.410
more time and explain it.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.030
It is simple.

06:18.450 --> 06:20.160
If I if I have.

06:21.490 --> 06:27.930
There can be this also that both of them are not in my longest common subsequent raid.

06:27.970 --> 06:33.250
That means we took up case when both of them are in the longest common subsequent when both of them

06:33.250 --> 06:33.730
are equal.

06:33.820 --> 06:37.780
This case with Dukakis win is not there, which is this case.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.630
We do a case when B is not there, this case.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.200
But what if both of them are not there in B?

06:44.470 --> 06:46.810
Then can we say that it is equal to.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.190
This which is deep.

06:50.280 --> 06:57.030
I might g is equal to all of this in this case, which is I plus one comedy plus one.

06:57.420 --> 07:01.380
That means if both of them are not there, then what is the remaining string to be matched this in this?

07:02.260 --> 07:04.480
And can I say that I take this case?

07:05.350 --> 07:07.570
Well, not taking this case.

07:07.570 --> 07:08.950
Give me a wrong answer.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.440
No, they let me let me explain this to you.

07:12.440 --> 07:16.490
And it's it's very important to understand this, because this will also.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.310
It problems in future.

07:21.390 --> 07:22.710
So the first thing is.

07:25.070 --> 07:25.790
This case.

07:25.940 --> 07:29.480
We can take this case and it will give us the right answer if we take it.

07:30.230 --> 07:34.340
But if we do not take this case right now, it will still give us the right answer.

07:34.820 --> 07:35.180
Why?

07:35.600 --> 07:38.270
Because this case is being handled indirectly.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.570
So you remember we are taking maximum of this in this.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.220
Let me let me take an example.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.770
Let's say if I am on BP zero zero.

07:46.860 --> 07:49.650
800 will call DP zero one.

07:51.050 --> 07:51.950
And BP.

07:53.050 --> 07:53.620
One zero.

07:55.090 --> 07:55.390
Eight.

07:56.750 --> 08:05.930
Now just remember BP zero one, you know, it's already p02, which is a plus one and EPA plus one go

08:05.930 --> 08:06.260
magic.

08:07.400 --> 08:11.660
If we one common similarity people zero will do the same deep zero to.

08:12.650 --> 08:16.910
Also BP to zero and DP one comma one.

08:17.540 --> 08:24.500
In this what's happening instead of calling a third case which is DP one one in the case that we are

08:24.500 --> 08:30.180
talking about this case that both of them are not there, this particular case is being handled over

08:30.200 --> 08:31.070
here and here.

08:32.090 --> 08:37.900
If it is already being handled in its subtree and we are taking maximum of all of them invite to make

08:37.900 --> 08:38.410
a third.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.610
Why do make a call?

08:41.390 --> 08:44.770
Why do you need three branches when only two can work?

08:45.210 --> 08:47.420
So this is what is called optimal substructure.

08:47.450 --> 08:52.130
You must have heard about it at the beginning of this course.

08:52.810 --> 08:54.560
Eight Optimal Substructure.

08:54.590 --> 08:59.390
That means if I don't take this abstracted and do work on down so it would work, right?

09:00.290 --> 09:02.110
It's what's the meaning of optimal eight.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.090
So I hope this is making sense.

09:05.120 --> 09:10.490
So what we'll do is we'll not take this case into account because it is already being handled in.

09:11.500 --> 09:15.400
This case and for this case that I'll be calling this particular.

09:16.930 --> 09:22.540
Maybe later it will be a blessed one day who's a comedy policeman will be able as when they present

09:22.540 --> 09:23.230
for this idea.

09:24.010 --> 09:27.280
That means you're not thinking two steps ahead will only think one step away.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.230
Oh, yeah.

09:31.190 --> 09:32.180
I hope this is clear.

09:32.780 --> 09:33.710
Of course you can call it.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.020
It won't matter.

09:35.030 --> 09:40.190
But although there won't be any difference in the complexities because it's just one extra case calling

09:40.190 --> 09:42.140
and I will memorize it, of course.

09:42.710 --> 09:47.170
So no, not much in the time and complexity will change it.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.930
I hope you got this the longest comments up sequence and we are doing the same thing for every problem.

09:55.570 --> 09:59.980
The idea what all options are there this option, then this, this option.

09:59.980 --> 10:04.930
Then this makes less one whatever we want be and simply have it right.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.030
And so let's call this.

10:07.930 --> 10:08.950
We have two strings.

10:10.410 --> 10:15.420
Also I have a problem in which, instead of subsequent will be finding substance.

10:15.930 --> 10:16.650
It is this one.

10:17.620 --> 10:19.140
Longest woman, 78.

10:19.150 --> 10:22.000
But right now we are talking about longest common subsequent.

10:22.540 --> 10:26.080
In the next lecture I read taking this problem longest common substring.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.490
But it is very easy.

10:27.830 --> 10:33.490
So I would suggest if you just go on to the upstream problem and think about it yourself included.

10:36.580 --> 10:37.390
Oh, yeah.

10:37.690 --> 10:39.130
Let's click on this.

10:39.370 --> 10:43.240
We have string schema elastic to strings SNP.

10:46.620 --> 10:47.730
Eight and.

10:49.770 --> 10:54.780
You can also put this in bottom of manner or top down that manner.

10:54.990 --> 10:56.310
In which element are you want to.

10:57.270 --> 11:00.720
I like dropdown thing so I'll just call in that.

11:01.670 --> 11:02.940
Or literally delicious.

11:03.530 --> 11:08.710
It was zero zero and we cleaned it all away.

11:08.710 --> 11:08.840
It.

11:11.940 --> 11:13.050
And so if.

11:15.390 --> 11:15.690
Okay.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.690
So let's talk about the abuse cases.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.150
It's a physical stool as dirt.

11:22.070 --> 11:22.430
Face.

11:23.320 --> 11:23.770
But if I.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.340
Is this the end and do it all to reach the end?

11:26.350 --> 11:26.800
Let's see.

11:27.460 --> 11:35.550
Do you request to treat or is either like better than zero because or the longest common subsequent

11:35.570 --> 11:37.150
of of to empty strings.

11:38.380 --> 11:39.130
Zero eight.

11:39.460 --> 11:45.010
Emily, if I has reached the end only I guess it is the end, then it's again zero.

11:45.010 --> 11:48.880
Because again, the longest woman subsequent of an empty string with anything is zero.

11:49.510 --> 11:51.550
And let's do this for J as well.

11:53.110 --> 11:54.940
Well, now it means both.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.290
I India are not in the end.

11:56.620 --> 11:58.180
But what options do I have?

11:58.210 --> 12:02.860
I have essays equal strategic and it is nothing but.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.940
Okay, let's take another variable called ons.

12:07.330 --> 12:07.570
But.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.610
Answer is nothing but one place.

12:14.750 --> 12:18.740
Alcaeus Alcaeus A-plus one comma J plus one.

12:18.740 --> 12:22.370
Because if both of them are equal, we are taking them into my subsequent.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.220
And what if both of them are not equal?

12:25.220 --> 12:25.880
Then it is nothing.

12:25.880 --> 12:30.050
With marks of alcaeus I call my zipless one.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.660
LC es i comma i plus one committee.

12:35.940 --> 12:36.390
Blessing.

12:37.580 --> 12:38.790
No, no, not on here.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.830
But it's a whatever.

12:41.340 --> 12:43.440
Next, will you give me their max?

12:43.440 --> 12:45.600
And I simply return the answer.

12:49.490 --> 12:57.080
Just below this we are getting to the yeah so trees the output this one thing right now this is a if

12:57.080 --> 12:59.030
this is the case then it is a linear solution.

12:59.540 --> 13:00.620
Otherwise it will be a.

13:02.220 --> 13:06.760
It will diverge under two, and it is to race to the power in solution in the worst case rate.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.790
So how do I minimize this?

13:08.790 --> 13:09.660
By memorization.

13:10.050 --> 13:13.470
Memorization is nothing but also to alter God caching things.

13:13.830 --> 13:14.910
So that's how cache --.

13:15.870 --> 13:19.890
You know that whenever you use an app application, you use an app in your phone.

13:20.310 --> 13:22.890
There's always a cache in it, right?

13:23.160 --> 13:24.510
So what does that cache do?

13:24.810 --> 13:32.640
Instead of sending the request again to the server and asking for data, it actually saves the most

13:32.790 --> 13:39.800
frequently used data into a memory and it directly fetch from the memory instead of using internet of

13:39.990 --> 13:40.260
Things.

13:40.650 --> 13:46.830
For example, I can Facebook, I can say you're using an app, Facebook, and there's an icon, right?

13:47.040 --> 13:49.980
That icon is actually stored in the memory.

13:50.490 --> 13:55.740
Of course, it's different from cache, but in cache also one of the other same things.

13:57.660 --> 14:03.840
Instead of sending the request again and again and getting the response it will, cash should send the

14:03.840 --> 14:05.970
request once ordered into the disk.

14:06.390 --> 14:08.150
Use it whenever it wants to use it.

14:09.660 --> 14:13.560
So that's how caching works, and that is called memorization in that case.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.170
But what is the length of the strings?

14:16.200 --> 14:17.220
It is five.

14:17.220 --> 14:18.480
One, two, three, four.

14:21.630 --> 14:22.020
Okay.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.180
But I think this is huge.

14:24.690 --> 14:25.050
Eight.

14:27.020 --> 14:27.490
Yep.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.910
This is very huge.

14:30.410 --> 14:31.220
Can I do better?

14:31.430 --> 14:32.780
Yes, of course I can do better.

14:32.780 --> 14:34.850
And I'll give you a better solution than this.

14:35.090 --> 14:37.460
But for now, let's just finish it.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.950
Well, and then you can also memorize it.

14:40.820 --> 14:46.850
So in the next lecture, what we can do is we can try to optimize this data and how can I optimize this

14:46.850 --> 14:47.420
particular.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.310
Memory limit.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.450
And this is also important.

14:51.480 --> 14:55.230
Many of the problems you will see optimization related to memory.

14:55.980 --> 14:59.000
And we will see how to do it well.

14:59.980 --> 15:01.210
So thank you, everyone.

15:01.210 --> 15:03.900
And then I'll complete this call in the next part eight.

15:04.390 --> 15:04.690
Thanks.
