Hello everyone so in this video tutorial will be learning about how to set up sublime text for computer

1
00:07.220 --> 00:07.700
programming.

2
00:08.330 --> 00:13.700
So of course, different text editor is out there, there are lots of text editor out there.

3
00:14.150 --> 00:16.730
You can try any other text editor which suits you.

4
00:16.820 --> 00:19.370
But personally, I prefer sublime text.

5
00:19.670 --> 00:22.430
And of course I would recommend you sublime text for it.

6
00:22.700 --> 00:25.940
You'll come to know more about sublime text in this video and you'll understand.

7
00:25.940 --> 00:31.970
Why was I asking you for sublime text to start computer programming in Sublime text?

8
00:32.840 --> 00:34.400
So first of all.

9
00:35.860 --> 00:37.450
Let me quickly.

10
00:38.850 --> 00:39.100
Yeah.

11
00:39.120 --> 00:40.950
So let's open a new window in sublime text.

12
00:40.970 --> 00:46.680
So this is a normal window for sublime text, but this tutorial is only about setting up sublime text,

13
00:46.680 --> 00:46.920
right?

14
00:46.920 --> 00:52.800
So this sublime text right now, I'm using Mac, so it can be for Mac, it can be for Windows, it can

15
00:52.800 --> 00:53.370
be for Linux.

16
00:53.370 --> 00:54.230
Device. right? 

17
00:54.240 --> 00:58.600
So Sublime text is available for all three. I've used in all three too! Right?

18
00:58.680 --> 01:03.150
So it just describes how you can set up Sublime text for competitive  programming, right?

19
01:03.570 --> 01:08.310
Installing GCC for C++ or Python.

20
01:08.310 --> 01:14.490
Or that you should try yourself how to install the different compiler so that different languages

21
01:14.490 --> 01:15.060
run on that.

22
01:15.870 --> 01:21.810
Right now I'm just showing you how to set up Sublime text for competitive programming so that it becomes easy for

23
01:21.810 --> 01:22.500
you to use it.

24
01:23.370 --> 01:26.070
And also I'll be using it in the future video.

25
01:26.820 --> 01:27.090
Right.

26
01:27.720 --> 01:28.920
So yeah.

27
01:29.580 --> 01:29.850
Okay. So guys

28
01:30.120 --> 01:32.670
This is a normal blank screen from sublime text.

29
01:32.910 --> 01:40.860
What I need to do is what I would want to do is that I don't want to open certain other videos, certain other

30
01:41.400 --> 01:49.530
tabs or Windows so that I write code in some other window I run code in some other window I give input

31
01:49.530 --> 01:51.920
in some other window and get output in some other window.

32
01:51.930 --> 01:52.100
Right.

33
01:52.140 --> 01:53.640
That would become too hectic for me.

34
01:54.120 --> 01:56.550
for competitive programming  you need  to save time.

35
01:56.610 --> 01:56.940
Right.

36
01:57.370 --> 02:00.810
But what would be better if you just write code in the same window?

37
02:00.900 --> 02:04.810
You put the input in the same window and you show the output in the same window, right?

38
02:04.950 --> 02:09.030
So that's what we are trying to set up here and let's move ahead with this.

39
02:09.720 --> 02:11.640
So firstly, what I what I have done is.

40
02:14.830 --> 02:15.190
Yep.

41
02:15.890 --> 02:21.280
Well, firstly, what we'll do is I will make a folder on the desktop called.

42
02:22.780 --> 02:26.230
Competitive programming codes, CP codes, codes, whatever you wish.

43
02:26.380 --> 02:29.980
And what I what we'll do is we'll have three files.

44
02:30.360 --> 02:30.640
Right.

45
02:31.330 --> 02:32.950
The first file is new

46
02:32.950 --> 02:33.550
.cpp.

47
02:33.830 --> 02:34.660
Let me open this.

48
02:35.020 --> 02:38.440
So right now, let's say it's an empty file, cool.

49
02:39.620 --> 02:46.490
And let me save this to the second file will be input.txt in which you will be writing

50
02:46.490 --> 02:49.920
out your certain codes right and the third file.

51
02:50.900 --> 02:56.720
sorry, input.txt is the file in which you will be copying down your input and the third file that I'll

52
02:56.720 --> 02:57.860
have in the same folder.

53
02:57.870 --> 02:58.160
Right.

54
02:58.370 --> 03:01.550
So guys, just consider this as a warning.

55
03:01.790 --> 03:06.740
that you have to include all these three files, the file in which you are coding.

56
03:06.740 --> 03:07.970
That is new.cpp

57
03:07.970 --> 03:09.950
The cpp file, C++ file for me.

58
03:10.520 --> 03:16.610
The second is input.txt file in which I'll be copying down the input and output.txt file.

59
03:17.150 --> 03:17.610
What is it?

60
03:17.610 --> 03:20.510
The output.txt file.

61
03:20.840 --> 03:24.560
So the code file will take input from input.txt, whatever.

62
03:24.560 --> 03:28.020
I've given the input there and write the output to the output.txt file

63
03:28.020 --> 03:32.420
It will write cout to the output.txt file, cool!

64
03:32.960 --> 03:36.830
Now let us see how to make some certain columns.

65
03:36.830 --> 03:41.510
Because right now also, if I try and code it out here, I like let's say I code something here.

66
03:49.860 --> 03:50.130
Right.

67
03:57.280 --> 04:02.680
Of course, I'll be, like, showing you how to make some sublime snippets that will ease us.

68
04:02.950 --> 04:04.090
These are worth it.

69
04:04.180 --> 04:07.020
So if I code something here, then also I need to switch windows, right?

70
04:07.030 --> 04:08.380
To see input and output.

71
04:08.380 --> 04:09.450
But I don't want to do that.

72
04:09.460 --> 04:11.200
I want everything to be in the same window.

73
04:11.810 --> 04:17.020
What I'll do is I'll find, quickly go to edit in the sublime text and.

74
04:18.490 --> 04:19.460
Or file.

75
04:20.600 --> 04:21.640
So I'll go to view.

76
04:21.810 --> 04:22.090
Right.

77
04:22.090 --> 04:24.940
So we have this view over here in the sublime text task 

78
04:24.980 --> 04:30.400
bar and in this view, what I'll do is I'll go to layout and choose columns.

79
04:30.640 --> 04:31.810
I'll set three columns.

80
04:32.360 --> 04:36.400
cool, so you can see that I've got three different columns in my sublime text view.

81
04:36.700 --> 04:40.810
I'll put output in the third column you can put an

82
04:42.560 --> 04:45.710
Roll it or move it to the second column.

83
04:46.220 --> 04:46.490
Right.

84
04:46.640 --> 04:48.980
And the first column contains a new.cpp file

85
04:49.940 --> 04:54.890
so guys, right now, also, it is very easy for me to write some input in the input.txt file so that

86
04:54.890 --> 04:58.610
I can get output in the output.txt file, right, it suits me.

87
04:58.880 --> 05:01.760
But as we can see, the code length won't be going much.

88
05:01.760 --> 05:02.120
Right?

89
05:02.420 --> 05:09.770
Because if I write something really long, let's say some good recursive relation or some lengthy dp 

90
05:10.070 --> 05:12.530
or some condition check statements again and again.

91
05:12.770 --> 05:14.150
So that would go in the next line.

92
05:14.930 --> 05:22.070
But what I want to do is I because guys, we know that input are what like for our understanding, for

93
05:22.070 --> 05:23.750
our examples, inputs are very small.

94
05:24.100 --> 05:30.380
I want to write a very small input in input.txt and get an output for output.txt for all the like

95
05:30.530 --> 05:33.320
for all the sample input outputs given in the problem statement.

96
05:34.340 --> 05:34.640
So.

97
05:35.730 --> 05:37.560
As we know, those are really small.

98
05:37.740 --> 05:39.900
See, some of you can prefer this setup, right.

99
05:40.050 --> 05:42.660
But let me show you some other way to do this.

100
05:42.930 --> 05:46.200
What I'll do is I'll go to groups and what I'll say is 

101
05:46.200 --> 05:48.240
I'll say max columns is equal to two.

102
05:48.890 --> 05:50.940
but earlier what we did was we went to layout.

103
05:50.940 --> 05:54.410
We did three columns, right, layout columns three.

104
05:54.420 --> 05:57.570
But now we are going on groups and we are saying max columns is equal to two

105
05:58.410 --> 06:03.540
So now what happens is the maximum number of columns is equal to three, but the total columns are two

106
06:03.950 --> 06:08.970
so maximum columns were equal to two but the total columns is equal to three.

107
06:09.600 --> 06:10.260
Right, So for that.

108
06:11.210 --> 06:12.010
We can easily see.

109
06:12.020 --> 06:17.930
So we have adjusted input.txt here and we have a adjusted output.txt here, right?

110
06:18.510 --> 06:22.810
Now, let us see how to take input from input.txt and write

111
06:22.820 --> 06:24.180
Input to output.txt

112
06:25.250 --> 06:27.830
And write output to output.txt, cool!

113
06:28.970 --> 06:31.190
So this is a normal function.

114
06:31.700 --> 06:34.370
And what I'll do here is I'll just write.

115
06:36.240 --> 06:44.670
Some, freopen is a method of C++, it opens a file what I'll say is open a file called input.

116
06:46.180 --> 06:47.500
.txt

117
06:48.500 --> 06:54.920
Cool, why I'm saying input.txt because input.txt is right over here on the right hand

118
06:54.920 --> 06:58.790
side and it's in the same folder as in New.cpp

119
06:58.790 --> 06:59.900
file, see guys.

120
06:59.900 --> 07:03.980
If input.txt is not in the same folder, is not in the same directory.

121
07:03.990 --> 07:09.410
If I talk in terms of computer science, it is not in the same directory, then you have to mention the

122
07:09.410 --> 07:09.920
whole file.

123
07:09.920 --> 07:12.110
path in this particular.

124
07:12.940 --> 07:20.980
string value, right, second value will be that you have to read, "r"  is for read and "w" is for write.

125
07:21.460 --> 07:26.320
And you have to read the input from input.txt to standard input.

126
07:26.920 --> 07:27.870
These are the three terms

127
07:27.880 --> 07:30.130
Open the file input.txt read the input.

128
07:30.130 --> 07:31.430
That is standard input.

129
07:31.510 --> 07:36.010
See, in stdin second will be open.

130
07:36.010 --> 07:39.100
The file called output.txt., So guys, It's a one time setup

131
07:39.550 --> 07:46.750
You don't have to set it up again and again in every code just a one time setup and it will benefit you a

132
07:46.750 --> 07:47.050
lot.

133
07:47.480 --> 07:47.680
Right.

134
07:48.310 --> 07:50.130
Write a file to stdout

135
07:50.140 --> 07:50.590
That is.

136
07:51.670 --> 07:52.540
Standard output.

137
07:52.870 --> 07:54.550
Cool, so now let's check this.

138
07:54.910 --> 08:01.590
Let's say I have taken "n",  let's input n and let's cout n, cool, and let's say the n value is 10

139
08:01.600 --> 08:03.190
let me build this.

140
08:04.980 --> 08:05.150
Right.

141
08:05.310 --> 08:08.580
So what we saw was the what happened.

142
08:08.940 --> 08:15.630
I initialize a variable called int n then it's it inputs that value from the input.txt what is the 

143
08:15.630 --> 08:18.450
first value is given here and it outputs it.

144
08:19.970 --> 08:21.890
in the output.txt file.

145
08:21.890 --> 08:24.200
So guys, Why am I showing you this tutorial?

146
08:24.200 --> 08:26.240
Because I'll be using this setup for the whole.

147
08:28.670 --> 08:31.190
course, right?  for the whole course

148
08:31.190 --> 08:35.000
I'll be using this sublime text with the same settings, with the same everything input.txt in the right hand side

149
08:35.000 --> 08:37.520
output.txt in the right down side 

150
08:37.940 --> 08:39.500
And these two lines.

151
08:40.520 --> 08:44.090
So before moving ahead, I would like to.

152
08:44.660 --> 08:44.900
Okay.

153
08:44.990 --> 08:51.230
So in the next video, we will see how to set up snippets in Sublime, So guys there's one important point

154
08:51.230 --> 08:57.890
that you need to notice is that whenever you submit your codes on different websites,like code forces,

155
08:57.890 --> 09:05.320
code chef or ad coder, wherever, right then that compiler will also search for input.txt file

156
09:05.510 --> 09:09.920
because you have submitted the whole code there to the judge, that is behind those.

157
09:11.220 --> 09:15.630
Websites will also search for input.txt and will search for output.txt

158
09:16.210 --> 09:20.490
For bypass that judge we use if and def, right?

159
09:20.500 --> 09:27.660
So I think I'll be continuing to that in the next part in the next video and this so this is how you

160
09:27.660 --> 09:31.260
can set up sublime in next part we will just see how to.

161
09:32.710 --> 09:35.260
Makes snippets in sublime that will really help us.

162
09:35.620 --> 09:36.530
And how to.

163
09:37.640 --> 09:40.060
Let's say define some terms

164
09:41.100 --> 09:43.620
And we'll also see if and def another things.

165
09:43.830 --> 09:44.150
Right.

166
09:44.400 --> 09:45.930
So see you in the next part

167
09:45.930 --> 09:46.500
Guys, thank you.
