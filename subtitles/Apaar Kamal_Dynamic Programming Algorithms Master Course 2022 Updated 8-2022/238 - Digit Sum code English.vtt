WEBVTT

00:00.380 --> 00:00.540
Well.

00:00.940 --> 00:05.410
So let's start this problem by writing a brute force solution of this problem statement.

00:06.310 --> 00:11.500
What we'll do is we'll go over all the numbers from one looking at it, and we will check whether it

00:11.500 --> 00:12.970
is satisfying this condition or not.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.130
If it is satisfying this condition, added Andrew.

00:15.310 --> 00:19.410
Otherwise, I'll turn back to just brute force solution, nothing else.

00:19.930 --> 00:22.540
By using this rigidity approach that I have already.

00:23.890 --> 00:24.790
Explain to you.

00:25.770 --> 00:26.700
But he knew.

00:27.180 --> 00:27.550
Yeah.

00:27.870 --> 00:28.200
Won.

00:28.560 --> 00:28.710
Yeah.

00:28.720 --> 00:29.370
Let's do this.

00:36.230 --> 00:40.610
Because I think you'd understand that it'd be far better in this order.

00:41.150 --> 00:43.460
Okay, so here, what we have is we have two numbers.

00:43.460 --> 00:47.300
The first is year, which is very big, and the second is division and beta.

00:47.300 --> 00:49.610
So let's take it and sing.

00:51.560 --> 00:53.780
And let's take this as an integer eight.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.540
It's called Let's Make the input here.

00:58.400 --> 00:58.700
Cool.

00:59.620 --> 01:05.930
Now it's like a brute force audition, which will, let's call it DP only then, starting from index

01:05.930 --> 01:06.290
zero.

01:06.350 --> 01:09.800
So what I'm doing is I'm going for all the numbers from one to kill.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.810
I'm going for all the numbers from one.

01:12.050 --> 01:13.850
Of course, here will be having zero.

01:13.850 --> 01:19.370
Also as a number alone very will consider zero to be exceptional.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.510
Case eight.

01:21.170 --> 01:23.660
Now I have all the numbers from one to K.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.970
Let's go down all the numbers from one to give us, and then we'll do the second part, which is.

01:30.670 --> 01:31.060
Okay.

01:31.330 --> 01:32.320
Comes first not be.

01:35.610 --> 01:37.260
Saad Saad from the other index.

01:37.260 --> 01:42.240
Keep on placing numbers eight and last is true initially.

01:46.440 --> 01:46.770
Four.

01:47.010 --> 01:49.290
Okay, so let's call it an IP.

01:50.130 --> 01:53.190
Next IP and we have our last.

01:53.490 --> 01:54.270
It should be a boolean.

01:58.320 --> 02:04.260
And what's the third thing I think we learned later, which is you're depending on the mortality rate.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.460
Mulugeta.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.340
So yeah.

02:09.490 --> 02:13.990
So what I say is I answered the question zero initially and nothing is.

02:14.470 --> 02:16.270
Just go over all the digits.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.890
Idiots will go from zero to.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.120
Till date and what was the deal?

02:23.870 --> 02:26.420
It we copied the deal from this particular part.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.970
It paid for digital started from zero go retail.

02:31.980 --> 02:33.480
And what will it do?

02:33.510 --> 02:36.840
It will simply call BP AI plus one.

02:40.390 --> 02:41.660
The last is through on live.

02:41.680 --> 02:41.890
Okay.

02:41.890 --> 02:43.750
Let's copy it on the air only.

02:47.930 --> 02:50.930
So if this really goes to deal, this statement is true.

02:50.930 --> 02:56.900
And if last is true that and both of them are true, then only the last will be true for the next particular

02:56.900 --> 02:57.350
location.

02:57.350 --> 02:59.150
So what we'll do is I'll simply say, okay, answer.

02:59.150 --> 03:00.110
Plus it goes through DP.

03:00.290 --> 03:06.200
So whatever the values, whatever the answers are there on the last part and simply added it and it's

03:06.230 --> 03:07.520
back from my answer.

03:07.520 --> 03:13.520
So right now what I'm doing is I'm going from one looking and taking some of the values, right?

03:13.520 --> 03:14.960
So what will this answer depend on?

03:15.440 --> 03:18.920
This will be true only if the number that is formed.

03:19.310 --> 03:19.700
It is.

03:20.630 --> 03:23.470
It's a digital based and is a multiple of the.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.400
So how will I figure out whether.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.170
Digit of a number in based and is a multiple of.

03:32.120 --> 03:32.420
The.

03:34.510 --> 03:34.860
Okay.

03:34.870 --> 03:35.530
Some issues.

03:35.980 --> 03:36.670
It's just going.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.250
So let's say I have a number and it is 50 or five, six, seven it.

03:47.350 --> 03:51.260
I'm making this number by going one digit at a time.

03:51.270 --> 03:53.580
You can easily see I'm going making this anytime.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.640
I want to find out whether it is divisible by seven or not, but we all have gone through the modification.

03:59.640 --> 04:04.980
This should not be out of this number can be broken down into five.

04:05.580 --> 04:05.780
Okay.

04:05.910 --> 04:09.570
It can be broken down into five and return to the power three.

04:10.560 --> 04:15.450
Plus 602 is about to blow 780 power oneplus 800 into the power.

04:16.920 --> 04:17.340
Zero.

04:18.690 --> 04:22.830
And if I want to find out whether it is divisible by seven or not, then it's very easy.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.450
Just distribute seven inside.

04:24.900 --> 04:27.120
It becomes five during the Devour.

04:27.130 --> 04:27.930
Three more seven.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.530
Plus 600 and the power to March seven.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.940
The 701 March seven.

04:36.950 --> 04:39.410
Plus it entered into the Baba zero, March seven.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.290
March seven and hold March seven.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.680
Well, this should not be for you to understand.

04:50.460 --> 04:51.660
Just the modular properties.

04:51.870 --> 04:58.740
Again, models can again be distributed inside that it is it goes to five more seven and do indeed the

04:58.740 --> 04:59.940
power three more seven.

05:00.990 --> 05:01.620
And so on.

05:02.830 --> 05:03.130
Eight.

05:03.820 --> 05:09.040
What I'm doing is whenever I'll be moving on the net, whenever I'll be placing a digit.

05:11.590 --> 05:17.320
Whenever I am placing a digital number at this particular location, I'm simply multiplying the number

05:17.320 --> 05:18.430
ten and adding a digit.

05:18.940 --> 05:22.450
Whenever I'm multiplying it by ten and adding a dessert, I simply take more.

05:22.450 --> 05:23.730
But nothing is.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.990
If I want to make five, six, seven, eight.

05:27.530 --> 05:29.480
Then what I'm doing is in my case.

05:31.190 --> 05:32.960
There's some issues with my laptop, I guess.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.530
If that means the laptop.

05:37.040 --> 05:43.760
Well, what I'm doing is in the first attempt placing a digit five in the second time making it six

05:43.760 --> 05:44.300
seven.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.230
And then what happens is five.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.770
First I have five, then I have five and ten.

05:49.340 --> 05:51.380
My little I'm taking more by seven.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.840
So in the first iteration, what happens?

05:53.840 --> 05:56.570
500 and more seven, which is 51 seven, which is one.

05:57.170 --> 05:59.330
Now I have that more equal to one eight.

05:59.570 --> 06:02.330
So it will be one and do ten more seven in the next iteration.

06:03.900 --> 06:07.500
And then literacy goes to three, so three into ten.

06:08.580 --> 06:08.850
Okay.

06:08.850 --> 06:10.200
So it won't be actually one.

06:12.660 --> 06:14.010
So I know I have more.

06:15.630 --> 06:15.880
Okay.

06:15.930 --> 06:18.960
So right now I have my equal to one here in this case.

06:19.290 --> 06:22.290
Right now I'm adding six after 50.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.640
So fifties mod was one.

06:23.640 --> 06:24.680
So what will be six more?

06:24.690 --> 06:25.200
It will be.

06:26.150 --> 06:28.640
50 plus six March seven.

06:30.100 --> 06:33.300
Well, which is nothing but vivosmart, which I already have.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.750
It is one plus six more.

06:36.310 --> 06:43.330
Devin Ray and this is he goes to zero zero in ten will be going to zero Wayne Newton because when I'll

06:43.330 --> 06:45.340
be adding seven I want it's smart.

06:46.530 --> 06:46.800
Well.

06:50.110 --> 06:50.630
Oh.

06:53.730 --> 06:54.070
Yep.

06:54.150 --> 06:57.900
So let's inculcate that thing into my good.

06:59.020 --> 07:03.490
The hard part initially when I'm starting from Zero The Mighty zero eight.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.830
So here I have the 13 gold.

07:07.880 --> 07:08.290
Mort.

07:09.760 --> 07:13.990
Now in this value, I am simply multiplying it by ten.

07:15.370 --> 07:20.770
So whatever mod I have got, I'm simply multiplying it by ten and adding a dessert so that the new digit

07:20.770 --> 07:21.820
comes into play.

07:21.830 --> 07:27.160
So what I have is more than ten plus a digit they're demanding.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.270
And just think more about my body.

07:34.470 --> 07:36.020
Because we wanted to learn more.

07:36.660 --> 07:42.810
Whenever I'm making a number, I'm making the number in two steps, which is 15 plus six, then into

07:42.810 --> 07:45.120
ten plus something, then in two, then do something.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.190
The minimum I'm doing in, then something.

07:47.190 --> 07:49.680
I'm just thinking more birdie to not be an issue.

07:50.010 --> 07:51.660
It's a distributed property rate.

07:51.660 --> 07:52.980
Mortgages are distributed property.

07:54.550 --> 07:55.480
So yeah.

07:55.480 --> 08:00.820
So I have Maude also and I have the list also and I have the indexes also.

08:01.150 --> 08:02.830
I now what is the basis?

08:02.860 --> 08:08.200
If I is equal to greater size, they the stronger.

08:08.620 --> 08:11.200
If I is, it goes to greater say the mean time on the last part.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.750
And if I want the last first I'll return.

08:15.020 --> 08:18.680
One or zero, depending whether the malt is equal to zero or not.

08:18.830 --> 08:22.250
So that's the mean statement that if the sum of their digits is a.

08:24.910 --> 08:25.450
Okay.

08:26.460 --> 08:26.820
Okay.

08:26.820 --> 08:28.170
So I misread the problem.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.530
It sees some of the digits it doesn't see.

08:32.670 --> 08:34.670
The more of that number eight.

08:35.970 --> 08:36.220
Okay.

08:36.220 --> 08:43.350
I misread it, but it is not 45685678 modulo some particular seven.

08:43.680 --> 08:44.400
It is not this.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.340
It is five plus six plus seven plus eight.

08:47.340 --> 08:47.910
Modulo.

08:48.930 --> 08:49.350
Seven.

08:49.930 --> 08:50.210
Hey.

08:50.220 --> 08:52.500
So here, I don't have to multiply it by ten.

08:52.650 --> 08:55.590
Just add the wizard and take it all.

08:55.950 --> 08:58.200
And if it would have been there, how many numbers?

08:58.650 --> 09:00.470
Which are less than a.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.160
Autumn multiple.

09:03.850 --> 09:04.930
How many numbers.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.480
They not some of the digits in based.

09:07.990 --> 09:09.200
If if it would be.

09:09.580 --> 09:09.880
Yeah.

09:10.360 --> 09:14.380
If it would have been that that how many numbers which I didn't get.

09:14.710 --> 09:15.780
The answer would be simple.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.900
We have two numbers which are divisible by eight.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.260
From Kentucky, but now it is some of digit.

09:23.470 --> 09:24.460
I misread the problem.

09:24.460 --> 09:30.310
So what we'll do, what we will do is whatever mode we are getting, we'll just add the desert to that

09:30.310 --> 09:35.500
modern day mode by the end, pass it on as the new mode for the next step, that same grid and if mode

09:35.500 --> 09:36.580
is equal to zero or not.

09:36.580 --> 09:36.850
Right?

09:37.090 --> 09:39.370
So how do we check that if maat is equal to zero.

09:39.370 --> 09:42.010
So start boarding in shortcuts.

09:42.250 --> 09:42.940
It will help you.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.040
It will help you save time.

09:45.130 --> 09:50.170
So if Mark is equal to zero, this will return true because this is a condition statement.

09:54.050 --> 09:54.260
Okay.

09:54.380 --> 09:55.670
It should not be as it should be.

09:55.910 --> 09:59.000
I got started, so I'm getting along well.

09:59.380 --> 09:59.510
Yeah.

09:59.540 --> 10:01.480
So what I've got, I've got seven there.

10:01.550 --> 10:04.040
There are seven numbers which are diesel.

10:04.190 --> 10:05.180
It was.

10:06.260 --> 10:08.520
Some of digit is divisible by four.

10:08.540 --> 10:09.410
Let's stick with one.

10:09.410 --> 10:09.950
That is correct.

10:09.950 --> 10:10.370
Or not.

10:11.620 --> 10:12.610
No, it's not correct.

10:13.430 --> 10:15.340
So why am I getting seven?

10:15.340 --> 10:22.420
Because there is this one extent of my guys, which is when the problem has been clearly mentioned there

10:22.720 --> 10:27.850
from took it only I wanted the numbers and this zero is disabled by having them but eight the sum of

10:27.850 --> 10:29.620
digits of zero is equal by every number.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.090
So that's why I'm getting seven.

10:31.090 --> 10:34.870
So instead of seven, what we'll do is we'll just print it by minus one.

10:35.740 --> 10:36.760
Let's have minus one.

10:37.420 --> 10:39.910
And of course, we want the mortality by nine over seven.

10:39.910 --> 10:41.080
So here we have two.

10:41.770 --> 10:42.550
We'll do that later.

10:42.670 --> 10:43.540
Let's not worry about it.

10:44.610 --> 10:45.210
So it is six.

10:45.630 --> 10:46.830
We are getting a correct answer.

10:47.430 --> 10:50.140
And now what we have, let's copy this pasted.

10:50.160 --> 10:56.310
It's normal because in a normal regression with the base case without constant that okay go little this

10:56.310 --> 10:59.850
particular digit and adding all the answers and returning back.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.560
It's been this.

11:06.990 --> 11:07.290
Okay.

11:07.290 --> 11:08.400
So it's taking time.

11:08.430 --> 11:09.480
Why is it taking time?

11:09.690 --> 11:11.010
Because the number is huge.

11:11.820 --> 11:12.990
It's one.

11:13.410 --> 11:16.080
It's ten to the power, eight or nine plus name.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.490
It's a huge number of things.

11:18.030 --> 11:19.200
It's taking a lot of time.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.390
And of course, how many numbers will be divisible by one?

11:21.840 --> 11:23.340
All the numbers will be divided by one.

11:23.340 --> 11:24.750
So the answer should be this.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.350
Only I'm getting this.

11:26.370 --> 11:28.860
Of course, it took a lot of time, but still I'm getting an answer.

11:30.320 --> 11:34.660
And this will take a lot of time, too, because, again, it's a very big number and it goes in.

11:34.670 --> 11:36.860
We'll go over all the numbers and so on.

11:37.460 --> 11:38.930
But guys, just think about this.

11:39.400 --> 11:47.210
It how how many states do mendip has, i.e. goes from 0 to 10 to deport four because it is going for

11:47.510 --> 11:49.250
all the indexes of the number.

11:49.610 --> 11:52.900
The number is of length going to divide four eight.

11:52.910 --> 11:57.260
I'm talking about the length of the number, not the limit of the number, the length of it, the length

11:57.260 --> 12:03.560
of the digits, how many digits it can contain and the buffer because he has these many digits.

12:04.520 --> 12:11.870
Last is only true of all the tabulation value and more can be how many will lose gross margin or lose

12:11.870 --> 12:16.450
realized in the if more it is always less than D then we have only undervalues it.

12:17.180 --> 12:22.010
If we have only 100 values in the third location, then how many total states are possible?

12:23.400 --> 12:24.180
What is DP?

12:25.260 --> 12:26.820
The total seeds which are possible.

12:26.820 --> 12:27.870
Is I to.

12:29.170 --> 12:29.970
Last year do.

12:31.070 --> 12:36.440
The which is in the worst case scenario brought forward into doing Doha, which is to introduce about

12:36.440 --> 12:36.800
six.

12:37.880 --> 12:38.190
Right.

12:38.600 --> 12:39.710
What if I memorize it?

12:40.810 --> 12:42.640
Of course, guys, this is a brute force audition.

12:42.640 --> 12:48.610
This is going over all the details that are the way this is going, what already are there and finding

12:48.610 --> 12:49.000
the some.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.370
But this is what dynamic programming is.

12:51.590 --> 12:52.750
It is optimized equations.

12:52.750 --> 12:56.920
So let's optimize it because we have only ended up over six different states.

12:57.280 --> 13:01.360
All the other states are kind of feeding into all these states, right?

13:01.840 --> 13:08.740
We are trying to devote six boxes and we have to devour nine numbers in this case, in this particular

13:08.740 --> 13:13.330
input, all these changes one nine numbers will fit into these tend to devices, six boxes.

13:14.690 --> 13:14.990
Eight.

13:16.910 --> 13:20.980
According to the general principle, there will be some rebuilding times and we don't want to get those

13:20.990 --> 13:21.530
in between them.

13:21.530 --> 13:22.550
So let's memorize it.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.750
Let's take the constant values that we use to take.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.040
Staggered ended about four.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.710
And in Memo.

13:33.870 --> 13:37.020
For I was lost and for more.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.520
So it's a tragedy, basically.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.610
So this mod this this particular location, let's call it.

13:41.940 --> 13:47.210
Because it's going we know that it goes in and it only it is less than equal to under.

13:47.730 --> 13:48.120
Yeah.

13:48.510 --> 13:49.560
It should work because.

13:51.380 --> 13:55.370
The values will be lessened and it will it memoires it.

13:55.370 --> 13:56.510
We know how to memorize it.

13:58.070 --> 13:58.390
Mama.

13:59.010 --> 14:00.200
I'm a minus one.

14:01.450 --> 14:02.700
Ackerman signs of.

14:04.780 --> 14:08.560
So, guys, I just wanted you to I just wanted to make you understand this still part.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.550
How is this recording going for all the numbers, which are less than 75?

14:14.060 --> 14:15.880
And then I want you to understand that, okay.

14:16.130 --> 14:17.180
If you're going for all the numbers.

14:17.180 --> 14:20.720
But all those numbers are have only three states.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.580
These three states, eight.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.200
So we have made.

14:25.190 --> 14:28.910
The memo made by minus one.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.800
So what we do is normal memorization events.

14:32.880 --> 14:33.600
It should be.

14:35.830 --> 14:36.890
It is Memo.

14:38.020 --> 14:38.440
I.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.940
But he lost.

14:41.660 --> 14:42.800
And this is.

14:43.700 --> 14:44.120
Mart.

14:44.930 --> 14:49.420
Well, if answer is not equal to minus under, then unsaid advice.

14:49.820 --> 14:50.990
Answer this, you know.

14:52.680 --> 14:52.980
This.

14:54.980 --> 14:56.570
This is normal minimization.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.500
And now you can see that it's working really fast.

15:00.530 --> 15:01.160
Really quick.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.020
It's sick with some big numbers.

15:05.700 --> 15:06.540
Talk about this.

15:09.810 --> 15:10.110
Okay.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.000
So what we have is we have five to something.

15:13.020 --> 15:13.260
Okay.

15:13.260 --> 15:17.820
So we are not getting a correct answer because I have not considered tainted by name to seven moderate.

15:17.970 --> 15:19.230
But I hope you have understood this.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.270
And this is the original answer.

15:22.020 --> 15:27.420
These many numbers, numbers from between one and nine, eight, seven, six, whatever the value is.

15:27.900 --> 15:31.020
These many numbers are divisible by 58, eight.

15:31.320 --> 15:34.380
And I want the answer moderate, enabling them to say I want to believe it.

15:34.380 --> 15:36.150
I'm doing the calculation I just ignored.

15:37.420 --> 15:38.170
Let's take.

15:39.070 --> 15:41.560
Oh, let's call it less.

15:43.390 --> 15:45.010
His buddy, Nameless Stephen.

15:46.060 --> 15:50.140
So here I am adding I just simply say my request to more or less.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.670
Well and.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.880
And here also, I'm subtracting your trade.

15:56.480 --> 16:01.190
So whenever I break something, I will add more or less to it.

16:01.190 --> 16:03.470
And then again, take artists.

16:04.600 --> 16:05.110
Police.

16:06.140 --> 16:08.840
I hope this has been very clear to all of us.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.710
The model is probably the billboard.

16:12.720 --> 16:17.130
So this is the GDP, the digital print, I think it now is.

16:17.130 --> 16:21.080
You might be wondering that again, the GDP problems we have ranges from year to year.

16:21.120 --> 16:27.150
And so in this world also we could have a range that from L2 are telling me how many numbers some of

16:27.150 --> 16:33.240
the data and based on is on multiple of D instead of one to get let's say I have L2, but then I can

16:33.810 --> 16:34.860
solve it very easily.

16:34.860 --> 16:35.190
Right.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.990
If I have something from L2.

16:36.990 --> 16:42.480
Ah then what I can do is I can find out that how many such possible terms are there from 1 to 4, and

16:42.480 --> 16:43.930
I can simply subtract it.

16:44.010 --> 16:46.710
How many such possible terms are from one to L minus one?

16:48.240 --> 16:52.950
Late, but this will be my final answer if I want to find out how many such dumps are there from El

16:52.950 --> 16:53.250
Dorado.

16:54.220 --> 16:54.480
Well.

16:55.540 --> 16:56.590
This should not be an issue.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.030
So now you have understood what is the GDP and how how does leadership work?

17:03.040 --> 17:04.570
And it comes hand in many places.

17:05.140 --> 17:10.750
So I would suggest you do just roam around a little bit and solve some pretty deep problems at the from

17:10.750 --> 17:14.140
hectoring or voices whenever it suits you.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.450
Hey, let's build it again.

17:17.980 --> 17:19.540
Modulus is ambiguous.

17:20.170 --> 17:20.620
Okay.

17:23.480 --> 17:23.750
It's.

17:23.750 --> 17:24.080
Name it.

17:26.150 --> 17:26.750
If more or less.

17:26.750 --> 17:32.000
And because well, what we have is six three, five, two, whatever we are getting.

17:33.240 --> 17:33.750
It's true.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.370
If I do, it's correct.

17:35.580 --> 17:36.660
It's talk about this.

17:40.250 --> 17:41.150
STU Correct.

17:41.600 --> 17:45.400
Because Dan's written by nameless and nine named name.

17:45.560 --> 17:51.320
And if I take MODERATOR Neubauer name just seven, it will be two will and it's copy and it's omitted

17:51.320 --> 17:54.650
on at quarter and it's sig whether it's working or not.

17:56.790 --> 17:58.830
I hope you understood the basics of leadership.

17:58.890 --> 18:00.540
This is the most basic problem.

18:01.730 --> 18:03.240
Eight of the GDP.

18:05.950 --> 18:10.890
This is the most important part, this last ankle.

18:13.430 --> 18:13.550
Well.

18:13.670 --> 18:16.190
So it works 200 milliseconds, not a big time.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.560
I really disturbed this, guys.

18:18.680 --> 18:19.700
So thank you.

18:20.390 --> 18:20.990
Thank you, everyone.
