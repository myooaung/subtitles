WEBVTT

00:00.470 --> 00:00.680
Yeah.

00:00.800 --> 00:02.540
So let's go to this part.

00:05.270 --> 00:09.110
At stake then put also we have three one, one, one.

00:12.410 --> 00:14.530
Let's dig in.

00:15.380 --> 00:16.370
And what do we need?

00:16.940 --> 00:17.930
Yeah, the Eddie.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.510
We're going to stick it out only when we're using it.

00:32.120 --> 00:35.720
So what we want to know is how many ones, twos and threes are there.

00:36.380 --> 00:40.460
So let's say one, two, three.

00:41.340 --> 00:41.730
Zero.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.820
Let me take it globally so that.

00:49.170 --> 00:49.470
Okay.

00:50.100 --> 00:50.340
Well.

00:52.810 --> 00:53.410
Zero.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.250
Initializing with zero initially.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.330
And then we will simply.

01:01.940 --> 01:02.210
Right.

01:02.990 --> 01:04.370
And what would happen?

01:04.630 --> 01:05.720
So here we have.

01:06.890 --> 01:07.210
Okay.

01:07.220 --> 01:11.780
So let's do it in an easy way, not waste time on this rule.

01:11.780 --> 01:18.050
It's a count and counted before eight or at least initially say own zero.

01:18.050 --> 01:20.090
Size of found.

01:21.050 --> 01:26.390
So I will simply say Count Sofia, blessed with a20001261 and so on.

01:26.790 --> 01:28.670
But I didn't simply say, See how deep?

01:29.570 --> 01:37.340
And here it will be count zero, count one count who owned the whole?

01:37.340 --> 01:40.880
I'm bossing all the variables because I need to solve this recurrence relation.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.070
If we ABCD.

01:43.250 --> 01:49.010
So here we'll have oh so we need to do a double date because we are worried about the expected values.

01:49.580 --> 01:50.900
It's defined double.

01:53.730 --> 01:57.010
Ali as long a bill.

01:58.510 --> 02:03.790
Now what we'll do is just write the DP function that we have zero fun.

02:10.170 --> 02:10.430
Well.

02:14.580 --> 02:18.540
So what are the cases that we have?

02:18.990 --> 02:22.710
This is a reconciliation is an plus.

02:22.980 --> 02:23.190
Okay.

02:23.190 --> 02:26.910
Let me say that early onset is equal to.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.590
And initially it is.

02:28.590 --> 02:29.790
And plus.

02:32.140 --> 02:38.200
Unless it goes to be, which is kind of one in this case, one in too deep of.

02:39.460 --> 02:45.670
Zero plus one, one minus one, two and three, eight.

02:46.030 --> 02:46.690
Then we have.

02:48.470 --> 02:50.510
We can make it to one, which is.

02:52.010 --> 02:53.540
One will be incremented by one.

02:54.630 --> 02:55.980
And you will be discriminated.

02:57.010 --> 02:57.990
Similarly we can have.

02:59.670 --> 02:59.890
It.

03:01.660 --> 03:03.400
Nightingale, a Dingell.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.560
You will be incremented and three will be discriminated.

03:09.420 --> 03:14.310
But we have only these three because of relations and we have also multiplied them.

03:14.940 --> 03:16.860
Finally, what we need to do is answer.

03:18.430 --> 03:25.570
There she goes to which is end minus is sorted and minus eight is equal to one plus two +38 or let's

03:25.570 --> 03:26.410
say 10 minutes you.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.490
And minus eight.

03:30.510 --> 03:31.740
And let's say it is.

03:34.960 --> 03:35.340
Double.

03:36.270 --> 03:37.140
It will simply return.

03:38.770 --> 03:39.650
Answer, Rachel.

03:39.670 --> 03:40.720
It's good.

03:41.050 --> 03:41.830
It's working.

03:43.590 --> 03:44.460
So dinner dates.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.050
You know, I guess.

03:49.130 --> 03:51.800
Oh, but I haven't.

03:53.170 --> 03:54.200
Put it in the best case.

03:54.850 --> 03:56.540
It will go on for several days.

03:56.950 --> 03:57.850
What's the best case?

03:58.940 --> 03:59.330
If.

04:00.650 --> 04:05.190
So it's very simple that none of them can go beyond zero eight.

04:05.570 --> 04:08.300
So if let's say one is equals to.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.940
The count of one is equal.

04:11.170 --> 04:13.660
It cannot go beyond zero eight.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.240
Cannot go beyond zero.

04:15.250 --> 04:18.610
We can only make one move and there is one eight.

04:19.120 --> 04:19.820
So what?

04:19.830 --> 04:20.680
What is the basis?

04:20.960 --> 04:23.260
When will we be reaching the basis?

04:23.290 --> 04:24.040
It is simple.

04:24.760 --> 04:25.210
If.

04:26.110 --> 04:31.390
Zero plus one plus two plus P is equal to zero.

04:31.390 --> 04:32.770
That means all of them are zero.

04:32.770 --> 04:35.200
Then only they'll be equal to zero because I won't allow them.

04:36.220 --> 04:42.370
I won't like allow them to go beyond zero eight if this is zero ultimately written.

04:44.740 --> 04:45.460
What you're editing.

04:46.480 --> 04:50.260
Think about this when all of them are zero, that I don't have anything to pay.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.130
What is expected?

04:51.130 --> 04:51.450
When?

04:53.930 --> 04:56.570
It is but eight and.

04:58.870 --> 05:01.720
The next is we have our sequels to n.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.650
No problem with that.

05:02.950 --> 05:03.270
Yeah.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.070
So we can only make this one movie if I have one left.

05:07.540 --> 05:08.410
A similarly.

05:17.830 --> 05:18.100
Hey.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.270
Willis again.

05:22.270 --> 05:22.840
It's sick.

05:24.230 --> 05:29.540
So there is something else that we are not getting correctly.

05:31.280 --> 05:31.740
Hmm.

05:31.920 --> 05:32.240
Okay.

05:32.250 --> 05:33.480
So initially I took in.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.860
I looking at it in.

05:38.540 --> 05:40.190
And found of A-plus.

05:40.190 --> 05:41.660
Plus, this works.

05:44.090 --> 05:44.210
Who?

05:44.280 --> 05:45.560
Let me check once.

05:45.590 --> 05:46.310
What's happening?

05:49.150 --> 05:49.990
And minus.

05:50.950 --> 05:51.310
Zero.

05:57.230 --> 05:57.580
Okay.

06:10.790 --> 06:14.210
But what we have is, okay, we have three ones, then we have one too.

06:14.210 --> 06:16.040
And then we have the one right.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.420
Then we have three zeros.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.050
I think this is great.

06:19.050 --> 06:19.400
Great.

06:21.370 --> 06:21.580
No.

06:21.580 --> 06:21.820
Why?

06:23.140 --> 06:24.730
Because it will always go in this fun.

06:26.140 --> 06:26.560
And.

06:27.010 --> 06:27.820
And this to.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.310
No, it won't go into entries.

06:32.170 --> 06:39.880
So let me check with zero plus one minus one one lesbian two -1.2 plus one and three minus one.

06:42.040 --> 06:42.510
Yes.

06:42.790 --> 06:43.180
Okay.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.380
There might be a problem here.

06:51.380 --> 06:52.190
And -0.

06:52.190 --> 06:53.330
I hope this is never.

06:56.780 --> 06:58.340
It's becoming zero in this case.

06:58.340 --> 06:58.640
Case.

07:00.240 --> 07:04.610
It went and is still and is Equestria three and zero is equal to.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.320
Three.

07:08.630 --> 07:10.610
He'd been basically been all zeros.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.680
What do we do in this case when.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.770
But it is N minus a.

07:18.520 --> 07:18.810
Right.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.770
Or maybe I'm mistaken.

07:20.770 --> 07:21.490
Let me check.

07:21.670 --> 07:22.060
It is.

07:24.380 --> 07:25.710
And minus a.

07:27.210 --> 07:28.560
Eight and zero.

07:31.060 --> 07:32.020
So we just.

07:32.810 --> 07:35.930
Let's have a check if and -0.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.710
Then simply divide it by zero.

07:40.050 --> 07:40.250
It.

07:42.010 --> 07:45.190
So again, there has to be some issue.

07:46.410 --> 07:47.460
Let me quickly check it.

07:48.270 --> 07:55.170
I kind of made a strong base case, actually, because case one was two plus zero plus one.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.220
Vegetable three always equals two.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.540
And so how can this be called a zero?

08:02.600 --> 08:04.010
It can be equal to zero, right.

08:04.250 --> 08:08.000
So here we have this one plus two plus three should be equal to zero.

08:09.460 --> 08:12.190
That means now all that is is going to be zero.

08:12.190 --> 08:16.150
So she says there are no more cruise ships to be built that simply don't make it.

08:16.720 --> 08:17.080
And.

08:20.370 --> 08:23.840
Now, as you can see, we're getting on so in a sec.

08:24.330 --> 08:24.560
Yeah.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.300
So it is 5.5 Iraqis.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.630
So let's not take this now.

08:37.000 --> 08:37.420
Okay.

08:38.020 --> 08:38.410
So.

08:39.390 --> 08:41.580
Can there be another mistake that we are doing?

08:42.300 --> 08:43.860
I think the worst case is correct.

08:44.220 --> 08:47.160
And of course, one can never go negative.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.390
Two can never go negative.

08:48.390 --> 08:49.590
Three can never go negative.

08:49.590 --> 08:51.720
No, because we are already taking it.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.220
And in the end for year end -0, they should book.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.770
1230 will simply return.

09:03.740 --> 09:04.180
Zero.

09:04.190 --> 09:05.230
Not one member.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.360
If you don't have any switches to pick.

09:13.290 --> 09:15.750
And the answer should be zero, not one study.

09:16.440 --> 09:17.070
I'm just.

09:18.380 --> 09:19.280
Maybe exhausted.

09:20.370 --> 09:24.840
Because of course, guys, if there's no sushi to pick, then we can't make a move.

09:25.080 --> 09:31.650
We are not making a moving expected number of throws it with zeros because all the switches have been

09:31.650 --> 09:31.980
picked.

09:32.900 --> 09:35.210
They before all the species are eaten.

09:35.210 --> 09:37.370
So all of them are written because they run and live.

09:37.790 --> 09:39.320
The number of the truths required is zero.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.460
And we have this base.

09:41.480 --> 09:41.880
I don't know.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.970
I was putting one beginning.

09:45.310 --> 09:45.570
Would.

09:47.490 --> 09:48.180
Let's stick.

09:48.210 --> 09:48.600
Okay.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.500
So this is three.

09:50.510 --> 09:52.120
This will be to.

09:54.290 --> 09:55.070
Oprah Winfrey.

09:55.130 --> 09:55.580
Yes.

09:55.830 --> 09:57.170
And then let's take this.

10:02.620 --> 10:03.010
Okay.

10:03.020 --> 10:07.150
So it's taking time because we haven't memorized it and it still.

10:08.070 --> 10:10.440
Fanning and it will keep on running.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.760
Let me cancel the build.

10:13.290 --> 10:15.720
Because we can see we have many seats over.

10:17.010 --> 10:19.770
So what we can do is we can simply memorize it first.

10:19.860 --> 10:20.670
It's my music.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.930
Could we be more?

10:27.490 --> 10:30.700
And let's take and the we in much.

10:33.930 --> 10:36.570
Being eight so constant in.

10:37.430 --> 10:40.370
And is 307.

10:42.990 --> 10:49.130
Full and biometric entry only because we know that we have only memories, three of them because for

10:49.150 --> 10:50.420
one can easily be today.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.980
So you can pick any entry and memorize it.

10:53.370 --> 10:53.910
Eight to.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.890
And we have it in Canada.

11:04.130 --> 11:05.240
These three variables.

11:07.010 --> 11:09.860
And it's a minimum wage in case equals to.

11:12.360 --> 11:12.870
Minus.

11:14.750 --> 11:15.040
Well.

11:15.350 --> 11:18.200
So it goes from zero to capital in.

11:19.150 --> 11:21.190
Reptilian and reptilian.

11:23.200 --> 11:23.410
They?

11:25.150 --> 11:25.320
Yeah.

11:25.840 --> 11:26.560
Anything else?

11:27.970 --> 11:30.040
So we have to change this, which is.

11:32.680 --> 11:37.130
So it is he goes to the to a of fine to.

11:38.050 --> 11:39.070
You can also take zero.

11:41.060 --> 11:41.300
It.

11:41.930 --> 11:47.420
If answer is not equal to minus one, then simply written answer.

11:48.810 --> 11:51.560
S answer is good Stalin and do the calculation.

11:53.160 --> 11:53.460
Eight.

11:57.120 --> 12:04.170
We have four 54.40 zero six and it's just printing till fourth decimal places.

12:04.770 --> 12:06.540
Let's set the pre season.

12:07.700 --> 12:10.490
Located Season ten.

12:12.240 --> 12:12.660
Based.

12:13.540 --> 12:13.810
Well.

12:17.240 --> 12:17.500
Yeah.

12:17.510 --> 12:20.180
It's taking quite time till later.

12:20.180 --> 12:23.480
It is four five, four, five, seven, four.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.470
It, it, it is 457498.

12:26.510 --> 12:28.250
So it should be accurate in nine places.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.830
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine, eight.

12:30.890 --> 12:34.340
So it is accurate in nine places and then it is kind of.

12:39.880 --> 12:40.200
Cool.

12:40.210 --> 12:44.020
So let's summited once, and I think I'm in the memorizing part.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.160
Clearly.

12:45.730 --> 12:46.570
One, two, three.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.230
And.

12:47.380 --> 12:47.650
Yeah.

12:49.200 --> 12:49.890
Copy this.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.550
Is this a madrid?

12:57.080 --> 12:57.530
It could.

13:01.350 --> 13:01.680
Pool.

13:02.400 --> 13:02.730
Pool.

13:06.070 --> 13:06.330
Yeah.

13:06.340 --> 13:07.860
So I just made this mistake.

13:07.890 --> 13:08.680
I'm sorry for that.

13:09.640 --> 13:15.310
Some of you might have got confused, of course, that when there are no switches left, when all the

13:15.310 --> 13:20.230
plates contain zero species, all the dishes have zero switches, then expected number of rows.

13:20.680 --> 13:26.140
They expect your number of weeks is zero because there isn't anything left of it.

13:26.140 --> 13:30.100
And they told me it's an exclusion and it's executed.

13:32.080 --> 13:36.340
So thank you guys and see you in the next part.

13:36.910 --> 13:45.010
But before that, I like this you to read some problems like some examples and problems on expectation

13:45.010 --> 13:46.330
values yourself.

13:46.830 --> 13:47.800
I think you.
