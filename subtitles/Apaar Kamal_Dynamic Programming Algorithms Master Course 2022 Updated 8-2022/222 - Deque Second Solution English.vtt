WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:00.600
Yeah.

00:00.690 --> 00:03.270
So now let's see a different way of solving this problem.

00:03.810 --> 00:07.770
And it can be a little more tricky than the previous solution.

00:07.770 --> 00:09.030
But yes, I want to explain this.

00:09.430 --> 00:11.120
I want you to understand this to date.

00:13.550 --> 00:14.720
Here we have a deep state.

00:14.900 --> 00:16.430
And what will this deep state.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.470
Deep state idea.

00:19.040 --> 00:22.670
Is deep seated will simply mean that what is the maximum value?

00:25.920 --> 00:28.260
Maximum value that can be formed.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.040
From the remaining 80.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.100
Remaining at it.

00:37.250 --> 00:42.080
So from eye of my whatever the eye injury being remaining, we don't have to worry about who's John's

00:42.080 --> 00:42.830
it is right now.

00:42.920 --> 00:48.650
It's John's independent basically ain't what we're worried about the maximum value.

00:48.660 --> 00:49.760
What is the maximum value here.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.820
The maximum value of X minus Y or or who's ever to answer it?

00:53.840 --> 00:54.140
Right.

00:54.140 --> 00:55.760
So I'll explain.

00:56.570 --> 00:59.780
That can be formed from the remaining ETI, that is from A to Z.

01:00.230 --> 01:00.680
I do.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.150
So we saw the Tories trying to maximise x minus.

01:06.240 --> 01:06.570
Right.

01:06.990 --> 01:11.970
Can we see that Jairo is trying to do is trying to maximise this.

01:12.410 --> 01:14.460
The Giro is trying to minimise X minus way.

01:15.450 --> 01:15.840
Modify.

01:15.840 --> 01:16.860
Take a negative view.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.120
What does this mean?

01:18.120 --> 01:18.330
That.

01:18.330 --> 01:18.960
Can I see?

01:19.350 --> 01:22.560
The gyro is trying to maximize by minus six.

01:25.570 --> 01:31.600
I see their diet is also trying to maximize vitamin as if they thought it was trying to maximize X minus

01:31.600 --> 01:37.150
y, basically trying to maximize my minus x because she wants why do we make this possible that we already

01:37.150 --> 01:37.990
saw it.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.360
So both of them are trying to maximize.

01:41.700 --> 01:42.660
Their own score.

01:44.060 --> 01:47.420
And they're trying to minimize the let me have different colors here.

01:48.290 --> 01:50.240
You're trying to maximize their own scores.

01:52.150 --> 01:56.230
And they're trying to minimize the opposite schools.

01:57.720 --> 01:57.920
Okay.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.120
So what are the supposed scores here, guys?

02:00.330 --> 02:04.470
Let's say it's chants, and I'm picking at the E.

02:05.300 --> 02:05.930
Already.

02:07.180 --> 02:07.470
Eight.

02:08.020 --> 02:08.890
But what I want is.

02:08.890 --> 02:10.450
I will ask that.

02:10.450 --> 02:14.020
Okay, give me what is the maximum value that Jairo can make?

02:14.590 --> 02:18.670
If Toro picks up eight, then what is the maximum value that Jairo can make?

02:19.060 --> 02:21.520
It is maybe of I plus one to G.

02:22.240 --> 02:22.750
That's what.

02:24.070 --> 02:27.400
This particular stage means deep 88.

02:27.550 --> 02:31.720
So if Tara is picking up, then Jairo can pick up nearby plus one.

02:32.790 --> 02:38.220
The Giro will I'm asking the maximum the Giro can make from DPA plus one comedy.

02:38.700 --> 02:47.100
And if that was speaking up, e.g. the second option that he has the maximum value the gyro can be obese,

02:47.370 --> 02:49.920
i.e. comma j minus one.

02:50.250 --> 02:50.520
Right.

02:51.210 --> 02:55.470
But what will to do is Doro warns that whatever Giro speaks, he'll try to.

02:56.630 --> 02:57.350
Minimize it.

02:57.940 --> 02:58.150
Okay.

02:58.340 --> 03:02.990
So here we can easily see that they're trying to maximize their own options and trying to minimize the

03:03.110 --> 03:05.280
opposing player's options.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.820
To basically, it means that.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.130
Thoreau.

03:12.050 --> 03:18.080
And do both of them wants to maximize these things.

03:19.480 --> 03:19.780
Eight.

03:21.070 --> 03:21.240
Why?

03:21.370 --> 03:24.070
Because this is what they are picking up.

03:24.580 --> 03:34.420
As I've already explained for Jada's case, an A.I. for Tara's case and AJ here are x rayed, and they're

03:34.690 --> 03:37.560
asking that what is the maximum value that other player can make?

03:37.570 --> 03:39.580
What is the maximum value that other player can make?

03:39.790 --> 03:45.970
And simply, they're trying to maximise these values at establishing to make some of the X minus Y and

03:45.970 --> 03:51.130
de-risking to maximise by minus x and four or both of them goes for both of them.

03:51.130 --> 03:55.390
Because right now what I'm saying is that it depends independent of the player.

03:55.660 --> 04:01.240
If both of them are trying to maximise their own values and trying to minimise the products values and

04:01.240 --> 04:05.230
what are the positive values that we get this what are the opposite player's values?

04:05.230 --> 04:10.240
Reward opponents values this they're trying to maximise their own values which is Ian.

04:10.990 --> 04:16.570
So whatever the maximum getting from both these options, that is what both the players will retain

04:16.870 --> 04:22.690
because generally saying to maximise by minus x and that is trying to maximise x minus four eight.

04:22.750 --> 04:29.020
So basically I've taken maximum on both the places instead of taking maximum in one place and minimum

04:29.020 --> 04:33.190
at second place like I used above in the previous solution.

04:34.890 --> 04:35.100
Well.

04:35.310 --> 04:39.940
So both of them are trying to maximize their values and trying to minimize the opposite values.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.220
So let me see if this one's.

04:42.470 --> 04:45.050
AQ This was the first solution that we made.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.590
And now we have the second solution that will.

04:50.430 --> 04:50.730
Okay.

04:51.270 --> 04:51.570
So.

04:52.510 --> 04:52.700
Yeah.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.040
Let's start from the basic.

04:56.050 --> 04:57.250
A eight.

04:58.170 --> 04:58.410
Good.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.850
So let's call it quickly.

05:03.650 --> 05:03.830
Here.

05:03.890 --> 05:04.100
What?

05:04.100 --> 05:06.410
We have 3008.

05:09.840 --> 05:10.890
Let's take DNA.

05:11.610 --> 05:14.910
And and also we need.

05:15.770 --> 05:16.010
Yeah.

05:16.020 --> 05:16.790
We'll do that later.

05:16.790 --> 05:17.360
Memorization.

05:26.890 --> 05:27.120
I.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.560
What should be the final answer here?

05:31.030 --> 05:31.300
The.

05:32.510 --> 05:37.100
What is the maximum value that can be made from dividing if that is starting rate?

05:37.100 --> 05:40.240
So see out repeat zero doing minus one normal.

05:40.700 --> 05:41.270
Look at this.

05:41.270 --> 05:41.840
Is that it?

05:41.840 --> 05:43.970
Give me the maximum possible answer possible.

05:43.970 --> 05:48.260
And of course we know from zero two and minus one it will be through Jan 28.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.430
So this is the mean.

05:49.430 --> 05:52.030
But again, let me finally repeat it.

05:52.040 --> 05:55.760
Both of them are trying to maximize their own scores and trying to minimize up with the scores.

05:55.760 --> 05:56.900
So that's what we are doing here.

05:57.800 --> 06:02.330
Taking this course when you might, taking negative of whatever the opposite is giving me.

06:02.900 --> 06:06.740
Look, this is their school and thinking negative of whatever they are.

06:06.880 --> 06:12.500
The opposite is giving me why I'm taking negative because BP returns me the maximum value possible of

06:12.500 --> 06:17.120
whatever the opponent is playing right that he will say, okay, this is the maximum value possible.

06:17.510 --> 06:24.560
If I'm going to play whatever the maximum is possible, just subtracted from my current score and it

06:24.560 --> 06:25.900
ended back eight.

06:26.890 --> 06:32.710
Bye bye bye subjected because give us a break something maximal will become minimum eight from from

06:32.710 --> 06:39.520
both of these whatever the best possible answer is there so I think Max of didn't make it so yeah.

06:40.760 --> 06:46.670
And if I do, gee, this is a different way of looking at this problem.

06:48.290 --> 06:50.720
Okay, so let's do it then.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.910
Okay, so here we have two options right there.

06:52.910 --> 06:57.520
Two options a A-minus minus DP I plus one D.

06:58.690 --> 07:03.840
Or the second option is e.g. minus dp i comma j minus one.

07:04.820 --> 07:07.910
From both these values, race, whatever the max I'm getting.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.530
And than it.

07:13.970 --> 07:14.150
Good.

07:14.540 --> 07:17.450
And let's make the best case for why this would be the case.

07:18.170 --> 07:25.970
If I was 2G, then I can now simply Daniel because now is independent of whoever is playing it.

07:26.570 --> 07:27.260
But I.

07:30.340 --> 07:30.610
Well.

07:31.960 --> 07:32.710
It's been this.

07:34.430 --> 07:35.680
So I'm getting my 18.

07:35.690 --> 07:36.350
That's correct.

07:36.710 --> 07:37.730
It's sick for this.

07:37.760 --> 07:38.390
What I'm getting.

07:39.630 --> 07:40.220
I'm getting them.

07:40.230 --> 07:41.010
That's also correct.

07:41.580 --> 07:43.920
Well, this the smallest possible solution for this.

07:44.310 --> 07:45.810
But I hope you're getting this advice.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.010
Why is this even working?

07:47.250 --> 07:49.740
Because both of them are trying to maximize it.

07:50.230 --> 07:50.450
So.

07:51.560 --> 07:55.040
It is deep zero two and minus one ordered bdb12, n minus one.

07:55.310 --> 07:56.690
Who's ever challenges.

07:57.290 --> 08:02.240
They're trying to maximize their own scores and trying to minimize double digit scores and from what

08:02.240 --> 08:05.140
the ways they take maximum and simply return it.

08:05.150 --> 08:06.590
So let me quickly.

08:09.640 --> 08:10.300
My music.

08:23.090 --> 08:26.960
And the next thing is they that I want you to solve a good problem.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.700
A famous problem, which is called.

08:30.660 --> 08:31.440
One problem.

08:31.740 --> 08:34.920
Eight So I want you to solve the wine problem yourself.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.080
W any wine?

08:37.710 --> 08:39.780
It's a very famous dining programming problem.

08:40.670 --> 08:41.150
And.

08:42.710 --> 08:44.270
It's also very common in interviews.

08:44.810 --> 08:50.150
Main problem and totally based on this particular logic that we are quoting here.

08:53.720 --> 08:54.860
Who else didn't answer?

08:54.890 --> 08:57.920
Okay, let's build the memo table.

09:06.610 --> 09:10.120
The memo, it goes to -2018.

09:14.490 --> 09:14.870
Okay.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.360
So I hope you are this very easy.

09:17.370 --> 09:20.010
Not not much to do with the options.

09:21.220 --> 09:22.260
Maximize yours.

09:23.370 --> 09:28.110
Whose evidence it is because we saw it at a particular in a particular severity.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.790
There cannot be duplications.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.680
It can only be one those playing it.

09:32.760 --> 09:33.020
Eight.

09:34.870 --> 09:35.410
Well, it.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.120
I just wasted.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.890
I don't get a time limit.

09:39.910 --> 09:41.740
That means a man wizard crew.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.630
So what is the total complexity of this?

09:43.930 --> 09:45.130
How many suits are possible?

09:45.550 --> 09:46.500
I graduate students.

09:46.510 --> 09:51.700
Of course I can not be greater than J, but big of notation.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.320
It's kind of N squared only.

09:54.280 --> 09:54.610
Okay.

09:54.610 --> 09:56.260
So we have got it correct.

09:57.030 --> 09:57.420
And.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.030
Grade eight.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.550
I hope you understood delegates.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.460
I hope you understood.

10:02.460 --> 10:08.100
How can a problem be solved by using two different dynamic programming solutions and approaches?

10:08.550 --> 10:12.570
This solution is completely different from the previous solution in which you were trying to maximize

10:12.570 --> 10:19.170
your interest playing and minimize injuries playing because we saw it always maximizing injuries, minimizing

10:19.170 --> 10:19.320
by.

10:19.350 --> 10:26.190
So there the common part was x a this was the common part in the previous solution to this problem.

10:26.490 --> 10:28.110
If were doing everything on the visual effects.

10:28.110 --> 10:31.170
But right now we are doing everything on the basis of max.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.870
If both of them are trying to maximize.

10:35.270 --> 10:36.410
And what are they doing to maximize?

10:37.460 --> 10:40.430
They're on school and trying to minimize the the school aid.

10:41.610 --> 10:41.950
Thank you.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.120
Soon.

10:43.170 --> 10:43.710
The next part.
