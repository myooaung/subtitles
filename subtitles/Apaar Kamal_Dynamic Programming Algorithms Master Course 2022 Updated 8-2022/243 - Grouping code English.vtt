WEBVTT

00:00.640 --> 00:01.450
Welcome back.

00:02.080 --> 00:02.920
Let's call it.

00:05.150 --> 00:05.450
Yeah.

00:05.650 --> 00:07.110
Simple put.

00:07.490 --> 00:09.320
And how do we call it?

00:09.350 --> 00:09.710
Okay.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.870
Let me firstly take the input.

00:14.730 --> 00:15.990
Well and.

00:19.360 --> 00:19.690
Okay.

00:19.960 --> 00:20.680
It's not.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.700
I'm just quoting a tabulation method.

00:23.710 --> 00:26.610
I'm not calling the record plasma motion because it's very easy.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.960
And liberty equality explained it.

00:28.970 --> 00:29.860
How will it work?

00:30.440 --> 00:33.640
Eight You're bringing elements of the lawsuit.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.530
Find the maximum value added on it.

00:35.950 --> 00:36.280
Simple.

00:36.730 --> 00:39.480
I'll just show you a new way to call it eight.

00:39.850 --> 00:41.230
So let's take the input.

00:41.350 --> 00:41.950
Let's stick.

00:41.950 --> 00:42.370
And.

00:44.980 --> 00:51.520
So we have a that is the value area I have taken here eight so let's take it as the in Brazil.

00:53.410 --> 00:56.890
And and growth and C in I and G.

00:57.630 --> 00:59.140
Well, now.

00:59.700 --> 00:59.950
Okay.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.750
I have I have input.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.140
I have the input now.

01:04.170 --> 01:05.670
Now, what we need to do is we need to.

01:07.380 --> 01:10.210
Even GDP added to what will be the land of the DPRK.

01:11.100 --> 01:14.010
One left in mind, because I'm doing this for all the mosque.

01:14.550 --> 01:22.860
Basically now what happens is now whatever said, I have I store that as a mask because that's the most

01:22.860 --> 01:23.520
important part.

01:23.520 --> 01:23.790
Right?

01:24.090 --> 01:29.080
That converting to mass, because we have only 16 different unique values here.

01:29.130 --> 01:35.600
So 16 will have to receive the power 16 and these are elements restore them as a mask.

01:35.610 --> 01:41.100
So if you are not familiar with the people with masks, you can go on and try to do people build my

01:41.100 --> 01:45.690
section from the dining programming course because I won't be able to, you know.

01:47.880 --> 01:51.990
Explain the pivot business completely in this video for this particular problem.

01:52.920 --> 01:58.870
I have the section debate mask above in the course you can feel free to try it.

01:58.890 --> 02:02.790
And yeah, what we'll do is we'll simply store beer.

02:04.180 --> 02:06.970
So I am digging up here because I saw two things in this.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.120
The first first value of the beer is so I have beer.

02:12.550 --> 02:13.420
Incorrect.

02:13.690 --> 02:16.030
That means the first value of the pair is nothing but.

02:17.230 --> 02:19.990
The max value that we are trying to calculate.

02:20.460 --> 02:21.970
The second value of the pair is nothing.

02:21.970 --> 02:22.840
But it's a mosque.

02:23.590 --> 02:24.280
It's a mosque.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.960
So if this integer values, let's say 1011, that means zero one and two.

02:30.570 --> 02:35.080
But it's a mosque of the last grouping because, you know, we cannot store sand so easily.

02:35.410 --> 02:35.680
Eight.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.470
We can of course we can store it.

02:37.780 --> 02:43.360
But I will not store it because it's easy to store that as a mosque.

02:44.230 --> 02:46.870
Otherwise, I have to increase their dignity and it will take a lot of time.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.850
So I just mosque that.

02:49.850 --> 02:51.050
Third in integer.

02:51.380 --> 02:56.730
So if that integer values 1011, that means zero one and two over the last eight.

02:56.810 --> 03:00.320
So whenever I'm going to add a new element, I'd say I was going to add three and to this.

03:00.350 --> 03:07.700
So I simply say the zero to the one and three to add these compatibility with zero one end but not to

03:07.700 --> 03:08.240
its three.

03:09.510 --> 03:09.950
Oh.

03:10.080 --> 03:10.430
Okay.

03:12.010 --> 03:12.610
Who are you?

03:12.740 --> 03:17.120
Mosque is nothing, but it is mosque in the last group that we are also calculating.

03:17.120 --> 03:17.420
Right?

03:17.780 --> 03:18.440
The last group.

03:18.860 --> 03:19.090
So.

03:20.050 --> 03:25.070
If the mosque value is 1011, that means zero one and three eight.

03:25.090 --> 03:28.900
So this last group contains zero one and two.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.400
The only it doesn't contain two.

03:30.550 --> 03:34.990
So if I want to add two, I just simply say, okay, whatever was said in the mosque, whatever the

03:34.990 --> 03:41.620
values in the mass, take their calculations, pull their two's compatibility with everyone else, and

03:41.620 --> 03:42.520
find a new value.

03:43.470 --> 03:44.120
Let's call it.

03:44.820 --> 03:49.930
So this is normally we witness because we want to avoid said what is fine.

03:50.700 --> 03:55.360
That means what should be the max value of max value of five.

03:55.410 --> 03:59.490
That means empties are zero and one should be the max.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.100
What would be the last set of why it should be zero?

04:02.340 --> 04:03.690
That means zero one.

04:03.690 --> 04:05.220
Representative Mosque is zero.

04:05.940 --> 04:08.340
That means there is no other.

04:09.470 --> 04:10.340
Well used here.

04:10.370 --> 04:15.870
So let me make zero zero, which is the max value of zero and the five eight.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.860
Now let's gender it all musk.

04:20.220 --> 04:22.420
Let's calculate all the mosque.

04:22.860 --> 04:24.230
Omar starts from zero.

04:24.240 --> 04:31.830
Go still to race to the power in and instead of the eliminate bit as here.

04:33.130 --> 04:34.330
What we have built here.

04:34.630 --> 04:37.390
And we have the deep values also.

04:37.390 --> 04:37.630
Right.

04:37.900 --> 04:43.780
The let's initialize the initially let me just say the DP mosque is nothing but very small value there

04:43.780 --> 04:46.600
just because we take maximum values.

04:46.690 --> 04:52.680
I will simply updated the DP mosque is initialized with very small value.

04:52.700 --> 04:53.290
Doesn't matter.

04:54.250 --> 04:57.070
Now let's calculate for all the bids.

04:57.190 --> 04:58.890
Let's see whether that bids.

04:59.660 --> 04:59.830
Father.

05:00.370 --> 05:00.550
Yeah?

05:00.970 --> 05:02.160
Let's calculate the mosque.

05:02.170 --> 05:06.970
So to calculate the mosque, we want the numerous, the previous mosque in which we are trying to add

05:06.970 --> 05:07.960
the current element.

05:08.560 --> 05:09.850
Okay, so here it is.

05:09.850 --> 05:15.670
Nothing, but it corresponds to X that I showed in the explanation.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.120
Right.

05:16.690 --> 05:17.650
Where is it?

05:17.680 --> 05:18.430
Yeah, this one.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.760
I'm trying to add x into the current set.

05:22.660 --> 05:25.300
So what would be the new mosque on which mounds are sure to burn?

05:25.330 --> 05:26.680
It should not contain X.

05:27.130 --> 05:28.510
And so I just remove.

05:29.890 --> 05:32.320
That bit from the mosque.

05:32.620 --> 05:33.730
This will be the new mosque.

05:33.730 --> 05:36.660
So new mosque is mosque which does not contain X.

05:36.910 --> 05:40.280
But in now, in the new mosque, I'm trying to annex H.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.080
I have two options.

05:42.130 --> 05:43.620
Best option is another.

05:44.240 --> 05:44.750
Oh, yeah.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.400
Let me date.

05:47.350 --> 05:56.410
It's a tricky problem but it's very nice of you in the standard whether a start a new group.

05:57.230 --> 06:05.780
With X or with the current with, which is not so correct to check this whether the current rate is

06:05.780 --> 06:06.440
said or not.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.970
It is said that only I can include in my current math.

06:08.990 --> 06:09.230
Right.

06:09.230 --> 06:10.970
So I have to make this check.

06:11.210 --> 06:13.370
That is if Ms. could shift.

06:14.980 --> 06:19.600
And when that means now that it is certain.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.710
Musk eight.

06:21.010 --> 06:25.570
If that were to said in Musk, then only I can remove it then only I can remove it and try to edit and

06:25.570 --> 06:26.830
do my new musk.

06:27.310 --> 06:31.390
Edit If they said remove it from the musk, that is the new musk.

06:31.510 --> 06:38.290
And we all know the new musk has has all its arms are calculated because new masks will be less than

06:38.290 --> 06:39.970
musk and we are moving forward.

06:39.970 --> 06:40.300
Right.

06:40.720 --> 06:46.400
So if we are on Musk was written Mars from 0 to 9 are already calculated and it.

06:47.550 --> 06:47.820
Right.

06:48.150 --> 06:48.930
Let's try this.

06:49.460 --> 06:51.090
So better start a new group with a brick.

06:51.150 --> 06:56.460
So if I start a new group with this particular bit, that is the new element that I'm going to add.

06:57.780 --> 06:59.220
Do you want me to make it X?

07:01.520 --> 07:02.460
I leave it to you at eight.

07:02.600 --> 07:08.240
So if I'm trying to start a new group with a bit, that means what is the maximum value?

07:08.250 --> 07:09.710
The maximum value remains the same.

07:10.580 --> 07:10.880
Correct.

07:10.970 --> 07:13.250
So I simply say that if.

07:15.790 --> 07:21.370
BP must guard first is less than BP.

07:21.820 --> 07:25.020
New mosque guard first aid.

07:25.450 --> 07:25.930
That means.

07:26.810 --> 07:33.170
If it is less than whatever the new mask was there whatever the value in trying to make and simply say

07:33.350 --> 07:34.910
that the mosque.

07:37.390 --> 07:37.600
Okay.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.910
Let's set this trip.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.540
So what is the new value?

07:40.750 --> 07:43.600
It is nothing but whatever the value of the previous month.

07:43.600 --> 07:43.930
So.

07:44.890 --> 07:47.740
This becomes this will increment it.

07:48.070 --> 07:50.800
And the second thing is, what is the new?

07:52.120 --> 07:52.510
Group.

07:52.690 --> 07:53.950
What is a new large group?

07:54.370 --> 07:58.360
When I'm trying to start a new group with X, so the last group is nothing but X.

07:58.780 --> 08:02.860
If the last group is only x, so I'll just let left shift with x things.

08:03.730 --> 08:05.980
I left shift one more times.

08:05.980 --> 08:06.880
That means not this.

08:08.170 --> 08:08.440
This.

08:08.440 --> 08:08.830
Indeed.

08:09.010 --> 08:09.870
That is one lecture.

08:10.030 --> 08:10.840
It is a new mask.

08:11.830 --> 08:11.850
Okay.

08:12.200 --> 08:12.940
So, um.

08:13.450 --> 08:13.900
Okay.

08:14.380 --> 08:16.600
I think it might be a little tricky for you to understand, but.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.430
I have actually left the recursive implementation of it.

08:21.730 --> 08:25.750
If you would, if we would have done the recursive implementation first and then came to this, then

08:25.750 --> 08:26.650
it would have been easier.

08:26.950 --> 08:30.160
But I just leave it to write one letter.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.420
But it is the new.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.050
Previous groups mosque.

08:34.540 --> 08:34.870
Correct.

08:35.770 --> 08:36.670
Last group mosque.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.620
Now, what is the second part here?

08:39.580 --> 08:40.570
Include.

08:41.900 --> 08:47.300
Built in to be the obvious first group.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.220
What is the previous best group?

08:49.290 --> 08:55.520
The previous best group is nothing but BP new mosque not thinking correct.

08:55.730 --> 08:58.910
So Dada second is always the group and art first is always the value.

08:59.690 --> 09:00.800
So let's try to.

09:02.670 --> 09:03.330
Okay.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.600
It will be it so that we don't have any and it's yeah, we don't have any interest.

09:09.020 --> 09:14.120
Now what we have to do is we have to find out that if I try to add the current element which is built

09:14.450 --> 09:21.170
into the previous best group, so I want this omission, the compatibility value, the total sum of

09:21.170 --> 09:26.060
compatibility values with all the previous values in the group.

09:26.060 --> 09:26.360
Right.

09:27.290 --> 09:28.540
So how do I do that?

09:29.050 --> 09:34.180
Very simple way to let's say score what the compatibility score in any slider with zero.

09:34.580 --> 09:40.180
It's let's have another portaloo and in this far loop let's say eight.

09:40.750 --> 09:44.080
And in this day what I want is this data present day represents.

09:45.960 --> 09:46.770
Element.

09:49.970 --> 09:52.550
The devious quest.

09:53.570 --> 09:54.580
Group eight.

09:54.810 --> 09:57.350
So how will it represented will simply say that.

09:59.450 --> 09:59.780
Yeah.

09:59.870 --> 10:07.760
So it is implicit that if it be mask or sorry, new mask, the previous best group rate or second.

10:08.620 --> 10:16.300
So this DB new masks Australia was made when this opinion was taken was the previous group a far right

10:16.300 --> 10:18.380
shifted daytimes anti-gun.

10:18.910 --> 10:23.090
If this is true, that means Jay was in the previous group.

10:23.890 --> 10:24.150
Rick.

10:25.270 --> 10:25.460
Yeah.

10:25.600 --> 10:34.030
So if Jay was in the previous best group, then I have to add the compatibility of and compatibility

10:34.030 --> 10:34.480
of.

10:35.450 --> 10:41.600
But with g h I because I'm, I want to include in the previous best group.

10:42.230 --> 10:44.210
So let's add the compatibility here.

10:44.210 --> 10:48.290
I'll simply say squared plus equals to E.

10:49.370 --> 10:57.590
Bit to the compatibility of then but and we are I hope this is clear.

10:57.590 --> 10:57.830
Right.

10:57.830 --> 10:59.840
So this is normal square calculation.

11:00.500 --> 11:00.860
Correct.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.880
And I've calculated the school and I'll just try to include that into the previous group.

11:04.880 --> 11:15.860
I, I simply say if our DP mosque or let's say mosque first is less than equal to DP mosque or New Madrid

11:16.430 --> 11:17.620
first place.

11:18.050 --> 11:18.380
Okay.

11:18.410 --> 11:19.940
So what's the new group value here?

11:19.970 --> 11:25.880
Whatever was the DP, New Madrid first, the previous best value plus D scored eight less score.

11:26.890 --> 11:30.220
So if the current models will use less, then they will simply update it.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.690
So let me just copy.

11:33.070 --> 11:36.160
This and see it is equal to nothing with this.

11:36.940 --> 11:37.690
The new school.

11:38.380 --> 11:39.460
And what is a new group?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.800
The new group is nothing new.

11:43.030 --> 11:44.280
Yeah, a new mosque.

11:44.290 --> 11:51.420
I'm trying to add new that they started the new element in the desert which is built by left certain

11:51.640 --> 11:52.150
buildings.

11:52.150 --> 11:54.280
They try to take the idea with the new mosque.

11:54.730 --> 11:55.330
You must me.

11:55.330 --> 12:00.850
I'm trying to add bit, but I'll just say that this is the new best group now because that was giving

12:00.850 --> 12:02.860
us a better answer.

12:04.390 --> 12:08.530
I hope this is fine because there are a lot of things happening in this for all we are doing for all,

12:08.530 --> 12:13.480
most we are going on, we are calibrating the schools and then we are trying to figure out these values.

12:14.460 --> 12:14.720
Right.

12:15.050 --> 12:21.260
It might be too much for your student, but I would strongly suggest you do implement the recursive

12:21.260 --> 12:25.820
solution first and then only go ahead with this particular bottom up tabulation approach.

12:26.150 --> 12:28.640
That's why it's always in the tabulations a little trickier.

12:29.820 --> 12:31.320
And yeah.

12:31.410 --> 12:36.830
So finally, BP mask or let's see, we want to find out the answer for all the.

12:37.850 --> 12:39.270
When all the elements are there, right?

12:39.320 --> 12:43.050
So if all the elements are there, that means all those really should be said in the mosque.

12:43.070 --> 12:46.280
That means it is nothing more to restore the power and minus one.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.910
So what I'll do is one left shift and minus one dot first.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.490
This will tell me what is the.

12:53.510 --> 12:53.910
Okay.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.220
Did I do something wrong?

12:57.970 --> 12:59.470
Poverty chemical.

13:01.130 --> 13:02.750
Excess elements, okay.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.660
Or any other thing went wrong.

13:06.020 --> 13:06.310
Okay.

13:06.320 --> 13:06.950
Not for us.

13:06.980 --> 13:07.970
That is the deep musk.

13:08.420 --> 13:10.160
I'm just sending a pair to it.

13:12.260 --> 13:12.710
Right.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.470
Just give me a second.

13:14.540 --> 13:14.840
Okay.

13:15.020 --> 13:18.380
If the women's vote first is less, then they bring you remastered first.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.020
Then let's update it.

13:22.890 --> 13:23.630
Correct.

13:26.740 --> 13:27.100
Okay.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.420
What am I getting here?

13:28.480 --> 13:30.490
Okay, I think this is.

13:30.820 --> 13:31.210
Okay.

13:31.660 --> 13:31.990
Got it.

13:32.680 --> 13:36.220
Does this 2820 is the answer for this particular problem.

13:36.640 --> 13:44.770
And what I have here is I have end is too deep about this -118 plus 28 to find a slider with zero.

13:45.630 --> 13:46.860
I get 28.

13:46.860 --> 13:47.810
So I wasn't going.

13:47.820 --> 13:51.540
I was actually initializing it with a very less value.

13:51.660 --> 13:53.490
But I think that should also work.

13:53.730 --> 13:56.250
Let me quickly check what's happening here.

13:57.700 --> 14:00.880
If I initialize with minus one hibernate, what happens?

14:01.450 --> 14:02.530
We get the new mask.

14:06.550 --> 14:06.880
Okay.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.880
So if you get the new muscle, this is 082.

14:09.910 --> 14:12.510
They should take it when you mastered four.

14:12.550 --> 14:13.270
Should be zero.

14:14.110 --> 14:14.530
Correct.

14:16.110 --> 14:17.790
We've demonstrated for us this.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.970
Less than knew my start first.

14:23.810 --> 14:24.500
Got it.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.620
There are two things here.

14:28.680 --> 14:32.700
The first thing is that we've already filled Mass zero eight.

14:32.720 --> 14:35.150
We need to start from one that I missed.

14:35.160 --> 14:42.150
And the second thing is that if I'm going to add the current element and to the previous best group

14:42.150 --> 14:46.020
of the new mass rate, then it is not, you know, new mosque in one.

14:47.580 --> 14:52.920
Like new mask or one left of beard because new mask in one left your beard is nothing but the current

14:52.940 --> 14:53.390
mostly.

14:53.610 --> 14:58.540
But what I'm doing is I'm trying to add in the previous best group, but what is the previous best group?

14:58.560 --> 14:59.940
It is deep in your mind's door.

15:01.440 --> 15:01.830
Taking.

15:02.770 --> 15:03.130
Verdict.

15:03.820 --> 15:10.330
What was the best group of the new mass when it got this answer, which is new mastered first in that

15:10.330 --> 15:12.400
group and the current element.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.140
Now let's bring it.

15:15.640 --> 15:16.350
So here you can see the.
