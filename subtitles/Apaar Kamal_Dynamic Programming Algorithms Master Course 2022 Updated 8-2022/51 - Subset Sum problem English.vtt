00:00.700 --> 00:01.480
Hello, everyone.

00:01.610 --> 00:02.640
Welcome to the studio.

00:03.640 --> 00:08.800
And now we have already understood what the studio here means.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.480
It's two dimensionally.

00:11.640 --> 00:12.240
That means.

00:14.440 --> 00:19.690
When we figured out the state of this problem, like a particular age for the recursion.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.630
Then we will see that the state contains two independent.

00:24.400 --> 00:33.070
And that those two variables of the states would basically be the two DDP Basically you can imagine

00:33.070 --> 00:42.130
it as Ferraro we have a column eight or what's the best way to think about it is not the cable way about

00:42.520 --> 00:48.230
linking of state this thing that they listed, which is x comma lines dependent on some other state,

00:48.230 --> 00:53.680
which is extracts from a y dish and some other state x double dash comma.

00:56.370 --> 01:01.770
Every state will have not two very variables instead of one variable as we Biden under the.

01:03.400 --> 01:03.880
Oh, yeah.

01:04.210 --> 01:04.810
Let's see this.

01:05.950 --> 01:09.130
So the first problem that I've taken here is all upset.

01:09.130 --> 01:09.880
Some problem?

01:10.300 --> 01:19.060
No, it is one of my favorite problem to start with on the PDP approach and initially some very simple

01:19.060 --> 01:21.670
problems and in the end will take some very hard problem.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.720
Let's see, what does this problem say?

01:26.320 --> 01:32.290
The substitution problem is that a given, a sum and an area of non-negative numbers, your domain if

01:32.290 --> 01:37.060
subset of error exist, it's some equals of a value.

01:37.090 --> 01:37.720
So eight.

01:38.260 --> 01:39.130
So basically.

01:40.340 --> 01:42.910
We have this area and we have this some value.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.810
Are you able to tell me that?

01:45.500 --> 01:45.800
Okay.

01:45.870 --> 01:48.830
Supposedly told me how many such subsets are possible of this area.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.860
But this area is Linda's favorite.

01:51.140 --> 01:53.810
And how many subsets are possible to do this to the.

01:54.870 --> 02:04.140
Eight, including antiseptic 0224 290 245.

02:04.710 --> 02:07.260
All these are subsets of the genetic data.

02:07.260 --> 02:07.500
Don't.

02:07.530 --> 02:09.270
Don't ever confuse somebody with.

02:10.750 --> 02:15.790
So of course you can easily see that there might be a subset with some equally well.

02:16.920 --> 02:17.250
But.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.880
Yeah, but the air is small, right?

02:23.030 --> 02:26.600
If the air is small and you can easily see that there might be something.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.280
But just imagine if the area was big.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.370
What is the brute force solution that you all can code here?

02:31.550 --> 02:32.210
A brute force.

02:32.780 --> 02:33.350
Brute force.

02:33.410 --> 02:40.970
We do indeed all subsets of this area by using masking, by using brute manipulation, or even using

02:40.970 --> 02:42.380
recursion that you've already seen.

02:43.250 --> 02:46.970
Then it all subsets and figured out whether the well what not.

02:48.210 --> 02:55.130
That's a brute force agent and it also upsets it all is absurd sexism and anti individuality for all

02:55.150 --> 02:57.360
them, whether there's some magical spell or whatnot.

02:57.870 --> 02:58.200
But.

02:59.350 --> 03:04.480
Are not here doing the brute force and brute force would dig to restore the power in complexity, which

03:04.480 --> 03:05.110
is huge.

03:06.220 --> 03:10.090
But here, we'll solve it in a much better complexity and we'll see how.

03:10.820 --> 03:11.850
But what I want you to do.

03:12.790 --> 03:19.630
I want you to think of a state and, like, basically go my way.

03:20.620 --> 03:24.130
And what is a state that we can have it?

03:24.430 --> 03:26.770
What we have is we have some and we have an attic.

03:27.580 --> 03:33.760
So can I see the state as a good ethics come away equals that?

03:33.850 --> 03:34.450
Tell me.

03:38.060 --> 03:38.300
But.

03:39.640 --> 03:39.990
Some.

03:41.880 --> 03:46.990
I basically advised them to tell me whether somebody's equal.

03:47.490 --> 03:48.690
Somebody is.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.410
I can be.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.500
Then be formed.

03:58.820 --> 03:59.750
By using.

04:04.330 --> 04:05.530
From X2.

04:06.340 --> 04:08.680
And basically the subject of the.

04:09.460 --> 04:11.650
So here the state is very simple.

04:12.100 --> 04:17.750
There are some advice that can be derived using array which is some suffix from.

04:18.370 --> 04:19.990
So here x is an index.

04:20.770 --> 04:23.290
X is an index varies by is.

04:24.910 --> 04:26.290
Look, just think about it.

04:26.590 --> 04:29.890
That index can be zero one, two, three or four.

04:29.890 --> 04:30.220
Right.

04:30.220 --> 04:35.920
And what we are seeing is whether a particular sum it need not necessarily be some it is some value.

04:35.930 --> 04:36.160
Right.

04:36.340 --> 04:41.920
And we just have to find out whether that Y values are possible from that particular at a they will

04:41.920 --> 04:44.930
be passing is it can be as of right.

04:45.190 --> 04:46.240
So let's think about it.

04:47.760 --> 04:47.940
Yeah.

04:48.930 --> 04:52.980
In Italy, let's say X is equal to zero and Y equals.

04:53.280 --> 04:53.550
Well.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
What does this mean?

04:55.020 --> 04:56.250
X equals two zero in y.

04:58.400 --> 04:58.780
I you.

05:00.390 --> 05:01.120
Zero wide.

05:01.120 --> 05:05.380
Well, means it means that now initially I have the whole area.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.610
Initially I have the whole area and I write down one index fund.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.770
That means on index zero.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.180
That means I have the whole area and I was some of the domain.

05:17.760 --> 05:22.260
Tell me, what are the options for the element on index?

05:22.960 --> 05:27.960
You know, what all options are there for this element to contribute in the sum?

05:28.500 --> 05:30.990
Just think about it just because we didn't think about it.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.630
If I have an element on.

05:33.990 --> 05:34.470
Which is.

05:35.430 --> 05:44.490
At a zero, which is this to what all options model involves can contribute to this in making of this

05:45.090 --> 05:46.260
in only two ways, right?

05:47.070 --> 05:48.300
Because we want a subset.

05:48.660 --> 05:54.510
So there's only two ways for this to be in a subset and there it will be in the subset.

05:54.510 --> 05:55.740
Ordered will not be in this.

05:56.840 --> 05:57.470
Very simple.

05:58.340 --> 06:03.860
That means there are only two options for this particular value to write, which is this at a zero that

06:03.860 --> 06:06.620
whether it will be in the sum or it will not be in the sum.

06:07.530 --> 06:07.770
But.

06:08.830 --> 06:11.920
Basically if it will be in the sum.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.020
Basically if I included in the sum.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.820
And the second is if I excluded.

06:21.570 --> 06:21.800
Eight.

06:22.470 --> 06:25.680
If I include two in this sum, that means.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.010
That means I'm including that doing this upset.

06:29.550 --> 06:29.840
Eight.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.200
So if I'm including two in this subset, what should be my new state?

06:34.650 --> 06:35.220
Think about it.

06:35.550 --> 06:39.150
And if I'm not including the two in my subset, then what should we want?

06:39.870 --> 06:41.010
Right now, I'm one in zero.

06:41.010 --> 06:43.590
I have this whole area and I want I want to say that.

06:43.630 --> 06:43.830
Okay.

06:43.830 --> 06:49.980
Now include the is upset this upset that I'm trying to make contains to the root contains two.

06:50.100 --> 06:53.880
Then what is the new value of sum that we want to make new value of?

06:53.880 --> 06:57.900
Somebody uses two and it is well minus two is ten.

06:57.900 --> 06:58.200
Right.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.510
That means I'm including two.

07:00.510 --> 07:01.050
That means.

07:02.370 --> 07:02.730
Now.

07:02.730 --> 07:07.500
Now, I have to figure out the other part of this upset with this sum equals to ten.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.580
Because I'm including two, it's eliminated.

07:10.860 --> 07:11.660
Good e.

07:13.080 --> 07:14.130
Exclude AIDS you.

07:15.490 --> 07:19.570
And now what is the remaining area from which I want to make this something?

07:19.690 --> 07:22.080
It is starting from index one doing.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.210
Yeah, but this second.

07:26.670 --> 07:26.940
Yeah.

07:27.210 --> 07:29.160
It's it's a what is the.

07:30.960 --> 07:31.460
Akin.

07:32.710 --> 07:35.530
Part of it, which is the exclusion part of it.

07:35.950 --> 07:41.670
If I'm excluding from this upset that I'm trying to make, if I if I'm not taking two into my subset,

07:41.710 --> 07:43.840
then what is the value of my sum?

07:43.840 --> 07:45.910
My value of somebody means same.

07:46.180 --> 07:52.120
It is well because I'm not taking during my sum and I'm asking okay from the remaining at it, but I

07:52.120 --> 07:56.560
do make 12 if you you're able to make 12 from the remaining three and I'm not using to not use it,

07:57.600 --> 08:00.760
but if any one of them returns me through that, okay.

08:01.600 --> 08:08.770
From the array one to end I'm I was possible to make ten or from 11 doing I was able to make 12.

08:09.040 --> 08:09.880
That means under ten.

08:09.880 --> 08:10.030
True.

08:10.060 --> 08:11.890
If any one of them is true, I'll return two.

08:11.890 --> 08:14.830
So basically this is this or this.

08:15.190 --> 08:15.790
Similarly.

08:16.910 --> 08:17.120
Yeah.

08:17.160 --> 08:20.750
Why does everyone get to hear who?

08:20.770 --> 08:22.610
Seven for five.

08:24.380 --> 08:24.850
19.

08:25.500 --> 08:32.050
Now again, again, we have two options, including one I exclude, even if that means is in this as

08:32.050 --> 08:35.030
a problem from this remaining area, not right to disarm.

08:35.270 --> 08:39.490
And if we are possible to make, then in return me to otherwise return me false.

08:39.950 --> 08:46.280
If I want to include even even a seven rate, that means now from security index I'm including seven.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.990
That means up from ten.

08:47.990 --> 08:50.090
I'll simply subtract seven.

08:50.090 --> 08:52.400
And it will give me at eight and.

08:53.700 --> 08:59.550
Finally, if I am excluding you, then that means I'm not including it when excluding even then it's

08:59.550 --> 09:00.450
very simple again.

09:01.010 --> 09:05.700
And I have to make some ten from the remaining activities, which is what I'm doing.

09:06.670 --> 09:06.970
Yeah.

09:07.390 --> 09:09.520
Similarly for this it will be included.

09:10.120 --> 09:14.350
Included exclude aid and finally will reach the end.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.460
So do you want me do it?

09:18.360 --> 09:20.430
What I can do is I can use.

09:22.580 --> 09:25.880
Actually, you know what will happen if I try to extend further down?

09:25.880 --> 09:29.180
It will be a very big a huge minority.

09:29.180 --> 09:29.690
That means.

09:31.750 --> 09:32.450
This is true.

09:32.480 --> 09:37.770
Then there will be food and then they will be 16 and it will be central.

09:37.870 --> 09:43.560
Of course you can try ideas, but I hope you have understood the major point that any element has to

09:43.570 --> 09:45.250
option to read or exclude.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.950
And I am talking about a particularity always to it.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.280
So this should be very clear.

09:51.430 --> 09:57.640
It is ethics going away whether somebody can be formed by using at A from x and basically the suffix

09:57.640 --> 10:00.240
of the added the remaining eight and.

10:01.530 --> 10:01.760
Okay.

10:02.490 --> 10:03.650
Let me quickly.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.020
Yeah.

10:04.530 --> 10:07.260
So we have this epic scam of late.

10:07.740 --> 10:11.130
So what is the recursive solution that I'm trying to make here?

10:11.910 --> 10:16.380
Ethics come my way include the x element, not the x element.

10:16.680 --> 10:22.050
But it is if I'm including the x element and the remaining answer, which is from x plus one to end.

10:23.190 --> 10:23.940
And this.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.510
But because okay.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.450
So I'm including it.

10:27.490 --> 10:28.620
Let me be.

10:28.910 --> 10:33.060
If I'm including it, then this becomes X minus x.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.810
Well whatever the value x foot.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.100
What's the second part?

10:37.200 --> 10:39.750
If I'm not including it, that means I'm excluding it.

10:40.020 --> 10:40.680
Exclude.

10:41.040 --> 10:41.970
It is simple.

10:42.860 --> 10:45.830
Express one because everyone wanted to do some military.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.440
And what will happen consecutively, x will increase or Y will decrease.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.590
And really we reach the end of the.

10:56.630 --> 10:57.430
Any rate.

10:57.860 --> 11:00.620
When we reach the end of their reign will simply say one thing.

11:01.070 --> 11:08.240
If X is goes to end, that means we have reached the out of the edit all the we have, we started from

11:08.240 --> 11:08.510
zero.

11:08.510 --> 11:10.370
We are going in minus one right now.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.270
I'm just making the base case eight.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.500
So if I have reached the end of the array, that means every sum.

11:16.860 --> 11:17.700
I'm out of that.

11:17.700 --> 11:24.280
I don't know any number, but if vies equals two VIDA equals two zero, that means if X is not there

11:24.300 --> 11:27.150
revised white x has used in.

11:27.150 --> 11:29.700
I'm an amputee and y is equal to zero.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.600
Then it will return.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.840
True because I can make sum of zero from new element.

11:34.980 --> 11:36.450
This can be a base case.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.450
Oh yeah.

11:39.450 --> 11:44.820
There's a second way of thinking about it, so it totally depends on the state that we are taking.

11:45.510 --> 11:47.430
What I said initially help me.

11:47.430 --> 11:53.370
Whether some can be formed using any X to invade basically the suffix of the area.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.460
What if I take the prefix of the area?

11:55.500 --> 11:56.670
The answer will remain the same.

11:56.670 --> 11:56.970
Right?

12:01.030 --> 12:01.690
Let me show you.

12:02.720 --> 12:07.220
Instead of suffix it to be meddlesome.

12:07.220 --> 12:10.160
It's possible from some prefix of delivery.

12:10.550 --> 12:10.790
Eight.

12:11.690 --> 12:12.160
Now.

12:12.190 --> 12:12.920
Now it means.

12:14.790 --> 12:22.880
Jump on the last element and I'm saying whether the this will be possible from two 719 but I know 19

12:22.880 --> 12:25.640
has to option whether it will come into somewhat it will not come in.

12:26.960 --> 12:32.230
So let me quickly from there, because evolution has been right now my exco, my body.

12:32.240 --> 12:32.760
I'm lizard.

12:32.790 --> 12:35.950
If you want me to define it or let me.

12:39.910 --> 12:40.210
Yeah.

12:40.330 --> 12:43.270
So this is the difference between top down and bottom up.

12:43.450 --> 12:44.890
But you don't have to worry about it.

12:45.670 --> 12:48.310
Both of them should be clear to you.

12:48.950 --> 12:56.320
It affects ways that somebody can be formed by using the prefix of it to not it is.

12:57.380 --> 12:57.830
This kind.

13:02.470 --> 13:04.000
Late, but not this time.

13:04.180 --> 13:04.480
You are.

13:05.090 --> 13:07.060
I know my state is a victim of I.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.320
And initially.

13:08.320 --> 13:08.590
What?

13:08.590 --> 13:09.160
What's happening?

13:09.160 --> 13:10.960
We are starting in Italy.

13:10.970 --> 13:11.680
What's the.

13:12.070 --> 13:13.180
What will be the final answer?

13:13.180 --> 13:13.420
When?

13:14.560 --> 13:14.800
Okay.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.640
Sorry, it's ex.

13:21.870 --> 13:22.000
Yeah.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.810
If I have the prefix of the area and I have a.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.350
But my vitamin grater initiative, I will be equal to the sum that is given to me.

13:30.650 --> 13:35.210
And what will be x equals to be equal to n minus one means I'm on the last of the three.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.040
Again, I have two options here.

13:37.490 --> 13:38.330
What are the two option?

13:38.330 --> 13:40.690
Include the x minus one element or not?

13:40.880 --> 13:42.380
Right now I'm moving backwards.

13:42.650 --> 13:44.300
Ideally I was moving moving forward.

13:45.230 --> 13:51.050
So utilizes that both of them are equally important because we'll be calling both the bottom approach

13:51.050 --> 13:51.710
and I've done a.

13:52.810 --> 13:53.350
Easy.

13:53.950 --> 13:55.000
These are my optimizations.

13:56.530 --> 13:57.340
So here we have.

13:58.830 --> 13:59.100
Yeah.

13:59.520 --> 14:03.840
So if X minus one element is included, then it's very simple.

14:05.820 --> 14:08.430
Tell me if the same is possible with some.

14:08.610 --> 14:10.760
It is of.

14:13.050 --> 14:13.530
X.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.510
Eight, which is and minus one for now.

14:16.830 --> 14:20.640
And then we did something impossible from the previous, but effects are not eight.

14:21.090 --> 14:22.860
And if I exclude it, then simple.

14:22.860 --> 14:24.070
It will be common way.

14:24.570 --> 14:30.510
So you can see is just one difference that here I had x plus one, here I had explicit one, but now

14:30.510 --> 14:33.690
I have x minus one and explaining it just a way of taking it.

14:33.930 --> 14:39.660
You are taking the prefix area or this affix and then really what happens is you can call it recursively

14:39.660 --> 14:43.140
by using recursion or you can even call it by using Babel.

14:43.830 --> 14:46.230
Well, firstly, I'll just call it using recursion and.

14:48.180 --> 14:51.630
Then we'll try to memorize it and understand it by Vidal's memory.

14:52.480 --> 14:56.760
But I know also you can see one thing that it said to Richard about in solution eight.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.520
You're dividing the two bastards, dividing into two parts.

14:59.520 --> 15:04.200
They're dividing apart seats, always into two intertwined to do basically to restore the power and

15:04.500 --> 15:05.310
find a solution.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.890
Until I reach the base cases.

15:08.340 --> 15:16.230
That means I reach the end endings, but will realize one thing here that of course the total number

15:16.230 --> 15:21.150
of states are due to the power in which there will be a certain limit.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.590
I mean, there will be a duplication in these states.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.860
Basically, there are some overlapping problems.

15:28.070 --> 15:32.360
There will be some overlapping problems in memory as it in it, and we'll see.

15:33.110 --> 15:33.980
But okay.

15:34.010 --> 15:39.320
So before moving on to the code, let's discuss this that how many distinct states are possible for

15:39.320 --> 15:40.790
these particular epics going away.

15:41.960 --> 15:47.950
So here what's happening is can go from zero two and minus one eight.

15:48.170 --> 15:49.040
That's the land of the.

15:49.230 --> 15:50.720
And what is the land of Dubai?

15:51.470 --> 15:52.280
I can go from.

15:53.430 --> 15:59.070
Zero to some particular value, which is some the how many distinct combinations of X and Y are possible

15:59.460 --> 16:00.520
x into Y, right?

16:02.520 --> 16:05.220
So what is Exxon and what will?

16:05.820 --> 16:07.710
So how many testing students will be there?

16:07.770 --> 16:10.770
They will be willing, but nobody is there.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.800
The three is expanding down to two.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.400
Race to the power in what is setting.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.490
Distinct states that X in Dubai only.

16:20.490 --> 16:20.700
Right.

16:21.150 --> 16:22.310
Basically it's.

16:23.420 --> 16:26.990
If India and India.

16:28.010 --> 16:33.420
And Anderson, so let's see if anything close to ten and some is equal to 50.

16:34.140 --> 16:34.420
Right.

16:34.770 --> 16:40.530
So if I think of it that way that I'm just writing a brute force and I'm not memorizing it, then how

16:40.530 --> 16:41.400
many states are there?

16:41.700 --> 16:44.340
There are two ways to divide in state it, which is going down.

16:44.730 --> 16:48.780
That means there will be ten 1024 difference.

16:49.170 --> 16:49.380
Eight.

16:49.800 --> 16:55.050
But if I'm including some and if I want to find out how many distinct values of and in some will be

16:55.050 --> 16:55.290
there.

16:55.380 --> 16:59.580
So we know some is always decreasing and is also decreasing in our in this case.

16:59.940 --> 17:05.130
And what we can do is we can simply say that there will be at most ten and do 50 different combinations

17:05.130 --> 17:06.590
of VB states.

17:06.600 --> 17:09.720
That is nothing but 500, which is far less than 1000.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.960
Well, here you realize one thing that.

17:13.840 --> 17:19.810
Out of these 1024, we can have at at most, 500 unique states.

17:20.470 --> 17:27.880
That means other 524 states are duplicate states which have already been aggregated.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.130
So there will be these many duplicate.

17:31.310 --> 17:31.560
Well.

17:32.090 --> 17:39.080
So let's in the next problem, we just call it and we will try to analyze it and then we'll also take

17:39.080 --> 17:45.290
over dinner table approach like by making a table because we want to see some optimized.

17:46.420 --> 17:47.770
Well, thank you.
