Hii all, here we have another interesting problem, which is paint house problem.

1
00:05.710 --> 00:09.220
This is, available on leetcode, you can go and try the problem.

2
00:09.730 --> 00:15.310
But let's solve it here, because the next problem that we are going to do is from code forces.

3
00:15.310 --> 00:20.020
And that is kind of a follow up problem of this problem.

4
00:20.770 --> 00:21.880
So let's understand this.

5
00:23.690 --> 00:28.700
So there are there are row of n houses

6
00:28.790 --> 00:29.420
So we have.

7
00:29.420 --> 00:30.210
N equals to three.

8
00:30.230 --> 00:30.500
Now.

9
00:31.770 --> 00:35.820
And each house can be painted with one of the three colors red, blue or green.

10
00:36.660 --> 00:38.190
So let me write colors here.

11
00:40.900 --> 00:44.750
Let’s say them red, blue or green.

12
00:45.550 --> 00:49.240
The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different.

13
00:49.630 --> 00:53.980
You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent house have the same color.

14
00:55.030 --> 00:58.330
So very similar to the house robber problem.

15
00:58.690 --> 00:59.770
But here we have this.

16
00:59.770 --> 01:00.760
We have three colors.

17
01:00.760 --> 01:01.660
We have to paint them.

18
01:02.140 --> 01:10.090
The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by n X 3 cost matrix.

19
01:10.930 --> 01:12.460
So this is the paint house problem.

20
01:12.460 --> 01:13.270
It's very simple.

21
01:13.270 --> 01:16.990
We have only three colors, but there can be a follow up problem with K-colors.

22
01:17.920 --> 01:18.180
Right.

23
01:20.120 --> 01:21.250
We'll be solving that later.

24
01:21.530 --> 01:25.370
Let's firstly think about this the cost of painting each house.

25
01:25.370 --> 01:29.750
With certain color is represented by a nX3 cost matrix, so here it is very easy

26
01:30.920 --> 01:34.160
Painting the first with the red color is 14.

27
01:34.160 --> 01:39.710
Painting the second with the blue painting the first with the blue color is two and painting the first

28
01:39.710 --> 01:42.800
with the green color, the cost is 11.

29
01:43.680 --> 01:43.940
Okay.

30
01:45.030 --> 01:49.350
So for example, costs[0][0], is this, costs[1][2] is this and all this

31
01:50.110 --> 01:54.450
cool, what we have to find is we have to find the minimum cost to paint all the houses.

32
01:55.250 --> 02:01.190
Isn't this a very simple and easy problem for you know have to find out a certain.

33
02:02.630 --> 02:08.030
Basically a certain sequence such that no, to adjacent belongs to the same color.

34
02:08.980 --> 02:09.250
Right.

35
02:09.790 --> 02:12.280
So how can we approach this problem?

36
02:13.030 --> 02:15.220
Though some of you might be thinking a greedy problem.

37
02:15.610 --> 02:19.840
Why don't I just take the minimum and go on and make the minimum in the next?

38
02:19.840 --> 02:21.850
You also take the minimum in the next.

39
02:21.860 --> 02:23.560
Again, take the minimum right.

40
02:23.980 --> 02:29.440
Of course, in this situation it's giving me a right answer, but this might not always be better for

41
02:29.440 --> 02:29.650
me.

42
02:30.520 --> 02:34.030
For example, the first approach can be take the minimum from the first row.

43
02:34.720 --> 02:37.630
And let's say if 5 was here and 14 was here.

44
02:38.810 --> 02:39.950
14 here and 5 here.

45
02:40.370 --> 02:41.870
Then I cannot take the first minimum.

46
02:41.870 --> 02:43.220
Then I take the second minimum, correct.

47
02:44.720 --> 02:48.290
And then finally, the last one is 3 so.

48
02:48.500 --> 02:51.410
In this case, the answer would be f5 + 11 = 16

49
02:51.740 --> 02:53.780
But just tell me just think about it.

50
02:53.780 --> 02:56.690
Will this always give me a good answer, this greedy approach?

51
02:57.290 --> 02:58.430
select the minimum.

52
02:58.430 --> 03:04.220
if the right minimum is again at the same level, then select the second minimum.

53
03:06.650 --> 03:08.420
So you need to think about this.

54
03:09.050 --> 03:13.850
I don't think this will give me a good, cool answer because I can make a case.

55
03:13.880 --> 03:16.310
Let's make a case for only two houses.

56
03:16.910 --> 03:18.230
So let's say I have two here.

57
03:18.320 --> 03:21.020
But in this, let's say I have three.

58
03:21.620 --> 03:26.210
And the second minimum here is 100 and the third minimum is 500.

59
03:26.780 --> 03:30.470
And in this case, let's make the second minimum to be five and the third minimum to be 10.

60
03:30.890 --> 03:33.470
So if I select two here, I cannot select this three

61
03:33.470 --> 03:35.740
And if I cannot select this 3, then I have to select this 100.

62
03:36.680 --> 03:37.640
In the greedy approach.

63
03:37.970 --> 03:38.270
Right.

64
03:38.570 --> 03:40.820
This 100 plus two will give me 102.

65
03:41.090 --> 03:45.320
But there could have been a second way, which is select this five and just take this tree.

66
03:46.740 --> 03:47.040
Right.

67
03:47.310 --> 03:51.990
So in these cases, only what we have to do is we have to try all the different approaches,

68
03:51.990 --> 03:54.060
and that's where dynamic programming comes in.

69
03:55.250 --> 03:56.680
So what I’ll say is, I’ll make a state

70
03:56.870 --> 03:58.290
And I’ll make a state saying

71
03:59.230 --> 03:59.530
That.

72
04:01.820 --> 04:02.030
Okay.

73
04:02.030 --> 04:05.100
Let me write the state dp(I,j)

74
04:06.070 --> 04:09.730
is nothing but the minimum cost.

75
04:13.270 --> 04:14.740
If I paint.

76
04:17.430 --> 04:18.050
Ith

77
04:18.830 --> 04:19.220
Uh.

78
04:19.720 --> 04:19.800
Okay.

79
04:22.550 --> 04:25.730
Minimum cost of let’s say prefix suffix.

80
04:26.180 --> 04:27.320
I hope you understood this.

81
04:27.420 --> 04:29.290
Till now that prefix suffix

82
04:29.300 --> 04:30.200
Doesn't matter, right?

83
04:30.530 --> 04:31.520
If I takes 

84
04:31.910 --> 04:35.090
If it takes suffix, that means for the suffix of houses.

85
04:35.090 --> 04:36.410
Then what's the best answer?

86
04:36.410 --> 04:38.870
Then it's a top down approach.

87
04:39.200 --> 04:42.140
Otherwise it's a bottom up approach of taking some prefixes.

88
04:43.100 --> 04:44.090
The minimum cost of.

89
04:45.440 --> 04:45.990
Houses.

90
04:46.910 --> 04:49.100
Let's say till I if.

91
04:50.070 --> 04:50.590
Um.

92
04:51.630 --> 04:53.490
Ith house is painted with.

93
04:55.920 --> 04:56.520
Is Painted.

94
05:00.260 --> 05:01.010
With jth color.

95
05:02.770 --> 05:03.060
correct.

96
05:03.730 --> 05:05.710
So I hope this state is very clear.

97
05:05.710 --> 05:06.700
It's very easy state.

98
05:07.360 --> 05:09.640
don't need much explanation here.

99
05:10.120 --> 05:11.530
Let's start from the 0th.

100
05:12.100 --> 05:15.370
house, so 0123 houses.

101
05:15.610 --> 05:17.710
And let me quickly write RGB also.

102
05:19.180 --> 05:22.960
But what will be the answer if I am considering the 0th house

103
05:23.530 --> 05:27.140
So basically from edge the prefix is only zero.

104
05:27.910 --> 05:34.390
If I'm coloring the 0th house with the red color, that means 14 is the minimum cos there is nothing minimum

105
05:34.390 --> 05:34.870
than that.

106
05:35.620 --> 05:39.040
And if I'm coloring the 0th house with green color.

107
05:39.340 --> 05:41.820
That means two is the minimum cost correct.

108
05:41.830 --> 05:46.090
And if I'm coloring the 0th house with the blue color, then 11 is the minimum.

109
05:46.690 --> 05:48.160
So there's no change in this.

110
05:49.140 --> 05:50.600
Now.

111
05:50.610 --> 05:52.030
Let's think right.

112
05:52.180 --> 05:56.460
So tell me if I want to color the first house with the.

113
05:57.580 --> 05:58.250
Red color.

114
05:58.570 --> 06:05.650
Basically this if I want to color the first house with the red color, that means the previous house

115
06:05.650 --> 06:07.840
should not have been painted by red.

116
06:08.150 --> 06:16.690
So what I can say if I want to like paint the first house

117
06:16.690 --> 06:23.320
with the red color, then what I want is I want the 0th house should be painted in colors except red

118
06:23.740 --> 06:25.690
right that it can be painted in blue.

119
06:26.620 --> 06:28.180
That means this is a feasible thing.

120
06:30.260 --> 06:31.990
And this is another feasible thing.

121
06:31.990 --> 06:36.130
Basically, these two is what I can take and use the 11.

122
06:36.130 --> 06:37.420
So what's the minimum in these two?

123
06:37.780 --> 06:39.970
It is 2 right, so two plus 11 is.

124
06:42.920 --> 06:43.260
13.

125
06:43.340 --> 06:44.390
Correct, So let me just write it.

126
06:45.920 --> 06:50.960
Now if I want to paint the first house in 14.

127
06:51.290 --> 06:52.910
Sorry, in blue right.

128
06:53.600 --> 06:59.840
If I want to paint the first house in blue color, that means I cannot use that.

129
07:00.110 --> 07:02.660
If this 0th house has been painted in blue color, I can use that.

130
07:02.660 --> 07:09.560
If 0th house is painted in red color or it was painted in green color because after them only

131
07:09.560 --> 07:11.480
I can now paint the first house in the blue color.

132
07:11.480 --> 07:13.070
That's a possible sequence.

133
07:13.490 --> 07:21.320
So here of what I’ll say is I simply say that if I want to find out dp(I,j), I'll simply say, tell

134
07:21.320 --> 07:21.590
me.

135
07:22.590 --> 07:23.150
For dp(I,j).

136
07:23.160 --> 07:26.190
I’ll say it is nothing but a minimum of DP.

137
07:27.060 --> 07:27.510
I.

138
07:31.500 --> 07:33.840
Minimum of dp(i-1, j’)

139
07:35.710 --> 07:42.650
where j’ is not equal to j

140
07:43.450 --> 07:43.710
Correct.

141
07:44.170 --> 07:52.000
That means for the for the best answer of all the houses till the ith House, if I want to paint the

142
07:52.020 --> 07:53.410
Ith house with the red colour.

143
07:53.560 --> 07:55.670
And tell me what's the best answer for 

144
07:55.690 --> 07:56.710
i-1 houses.

145
07:57.220 --> 08:04.150
If I have painted the i-1 house with not the red colour, either blue or green.

146
08:05.840 --> 08:08.030
So just tell me, what is the best answer for i-1

147
08:08.240 --> 08:10.550
Then it will simply for i-2 and so on

148
08:12.590 --> 08:14.380
So let me quickly write this.

149
08:14.710 --> 08:18.130
If I want to proceed with 14, then it is nothing but 14 plus.

150
08:18.130 --> 08:20.050
And what's the minimum of red and blue?

151
08:20.440 --> 08:21.370
I can say 11.

152
08:21.370 --> 08:22.690
And it is 25.

153
08:23.080 --> 08:23.370
Right.

154
08:23.770 --> 08:25.450
And the final one is.

155
08:26.400 --> 08:26.680
5.

156
08:27.000 --> 08:30.030
That means I will be painting the first house with the green color.

157
08:30.030 --> 08:34.860
So if I may be painting the first house with the green color, that means five is the cost of painting

158
08:34.860 --> 08:34.980
it.

159
08:35.250 --> 08:41.820
And now I can use red or green in this case because I cannot use the 0th house painted by blue.

160
08:41.830 --> 08:42.090
Right.

161
08:42.540 --> 08:44.310
So what is the minimum of red and blue?

162
08:44.310 --> 08:44.670
It is 2.

163
08:45.490 --> 08:47.880
So it is two plus five, which is nothing but seven.

164
08:48.950 --> 08:52.430
Now let's move to the next house.

165
08:52.970 --> 08:59.080
So now I want to find out whether what is the value of dp(2,0)

166
08:59.180 --> 09:04.400
That means 2nd house now if it is painting with red color, so what is the best answer

167
09:04.400 --> 09:08.780
for the first house to be painted in either blue color or green color?

168
09:09.500 --> 09:10.760
So what is the minimum of them?

169
09:10.790 --> 09:11.390
It is seven.

170
09:11.390 --> 09:13.700
So seven plus 14 is 21.

171
09:14.300 --> 09:18.050
So I hope you are seeing where this seven where this 21 came from.

172
09:18.320 --> 09:25.280
It came from the green color of this 2nd house and that green color of the 2nd house, came from the blue colour

173
09:25.550 --> 09:26.300
of the first house.

174
09:27.200 --> 09:28.820
So here you can see this is a connection.

175
09:29.850 --> 09:32.010
And we all know that we can always trace back.

176
09:32.100 --> 09:32.400
Right.

177
09:33.000 --> 09:40.530
And here again, for the green, for the green color, what we can say is the cost is the cost of painting

178
09:40.710 --> 09:41.700
the green color is 3.

179
09:42.060 --> 09:47.610
And if I want to paint the 2nd house with the green color, that means I can paint

180
09:47.630 --> 09:51.280
the first house with either red or blue.

181
09:51.300 --> 09:52.030
What's the minimum?

182
09:52.050 --> 09:53.310
It is 7 + 3.

183
09:54.280 --> 09:54.570
10.

184
09:55.180 --> 09:55.540
Correct.

185
09:55.750 --> 10:00.460
And finally, the last one is ten + minimum of 25 and 13, and it is 23.

186
10:01.330 --> 10:03.850
So now what I've got is I've got the values.

187
10:04.950 --> 10:10.500
That for the last house if I want to paint the last house with Red and this is the best answer for all

188
10:10.500 --> 10:11.220
the houses.

189
10:11.460 --> 10:14.820
If I am painting the last house with red that is 21

190
10:15.120 --> 10:21.000
If I'm painting the last house with green, then it gives me ten is the best answer and with blue

191
10:21.000 --> 10:21.930
it gives me 23.

192
10:22.310 --> 10:23.790
What's the best among all these three?

193
10:23.790 --> 10:24.330
It is ten.

194
10:24.780 --> 10:25.650
It means the minimum.

195
10:25.650 --> 10:27.540
Among all these three options is ten.

196
10:27.750 --> 10:32.280
So I paint the last house with green, which will eventually come from painting.

197
10:32.280 --> 10:36.030
The first house with sorry, paint the last house

198
10:36.510 --> 10:37.470
Okay, I think.

199
10:38.500 --> 10:38.700
Okay.

200
10:38.860 --> 10:40.930
I have written this RBG.

201
10:41.410 --> 10:42.520
It is generally RGB.

202
10:42.520 --> 10:42.830
Right.

203
10:42.850 --> 10:44.140
But don't worry.

204
10:44.410 --> 10:45.700
I hope you understood this.

205
10:46.360 --> 10:51.610
So I'm just painting the last house in color blue, which is coming from painting the first house in

206
10:51.610 --> 10:56.050
green and which is coming from painting the 0th house with blue again.

207
10:56.800 --> 10:58.170
So now you can see it.

208
10:58.240 --> 11:03.670
No to adjacent houses have the same colours and this can continue for all N.

209
11:04.750 --> 11:06.340
Then in the next video will quickly code it.

210
11:06.340 --> 11:07.480
And it's very easy.

211
11:07.660 --> 11:09.640
If you want to code it yourself, you can try it.

212
11:10.270 --> 11:12.750
I don't think much explanation is needed Right? Yeah!
