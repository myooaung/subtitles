WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:00.680
Yep.

00:00.750 --> 00:01.530
Welcome back.

00:01.710 --> 00:09.360
And now we understand the most easiest approach there is, which is that because they approach, I bet

00:09.360 --> 00:17.940
that this this is very easy and you easily like grasp it that it goes off goes this is also very gauzy

00:17.940 --> 00:20.790
approach, but we are doing it in a tabulation form.

00:21.420 --> 00:25.410
This is also a recursive relation here that we saw this part.

00:27.030 --> 00:34.320
But here I will make another type of deep state which is just a reverse of this and we will see that.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.010
How does it work?

00:35.360 --> 00:40.740
A What say is now I simply say that okay, f of zero zero is my answer.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.030
That means.

00:44.460 --> 00:46.010
That tells me that.

00:48.410 --> 00:49.190
F of 18.

00:49.190 --> 00:49.910
It's great idea.

00:49.910 --> 00:50.360
And then.

00:52.180 --> 00:53.590
Providing means that.

00:54.510 --> 00:59.010
What is the length of the longest form and subsequently the length of it?

00:59.730 --> 01:00.120
If.

01:00.990 --> 01:04.800
As from I will end and j from.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.610
But different.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.020
Didn't and is being considered.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.150
I hope you're getting this.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.430
That means if I'm considering the last.

01:18.590 --> 01:19.250
Last part.

01:19.340 --> 01:19.630
Right.

01:19.730 --> 01:25.040
So instead of prefix consideration, I'm having the suffix consideration right now.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.540
I'm just going opposite order.

01:26.990 --> 01:27.230
Right.

01:27.770 --> 01:30.650
So let's eliminate these sounds.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.590
I am x, y, z a b vi xp

01:36.550 --> 01:42.700
exybebyx8.

01:43.420 --> 01:47.920
So initially is what we'll say is okay, give me the answer from this particular location.

01:48.370 --> 01:53.740
It is if I is equal to zero and J is equal to zero, then give me the collision rate.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.870
So this is, this is this should be my final answer.

01:57.190 --> 01:58.270
F of zero zero.

01:58.270 --> 02:05.200
Right by because x of zero to n is the whole string and p of zero to end is all distinct.

02:05.980 --> 02:06.210
Right?

02:06.280 --> 02:08.800
So I hope it doesn't confuse you.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.870
So right now we're going in opposite order.

02:10.870 --> 02:16.660
Earlier, what we had in the abolition approach, we had the answer in the last place, which is f of.

02:18.230 --> 02:19.620
And Game eight.

02:19.670 --> 02:21.050
But now it's just the opposite.

02:21.710 --> 02:21.980
So.

02:23.400 --> 02:23.820
In this.

02:23.820 --> 02:26.580
What we'll do is we think that we're standing somewhere in the middle.

02:26.890 --> 02:32.340
We are not standing in the in the first place or we're not standing the last place where we think that

02:32.340 --> 02:33.600
we are standing somewhere in the middle.

02:34.230 --> 02:37.470
If we are standing somewhere in the middle, what options do I have?

02:38.340 --> 02:39.210
So let's do that.

02:39.690 --> 02:42.060
So let's say this is it goes to zero.

02:42.060 --> 02:43.340
This is the goes to zero.

02:44.670 --> 02:46.920
And what options do I have?

02:48.750 --> 02:51.330
So the options that I have is the first option is.

02:52.320 --> 02:52.630
Other.

02:54.080 --> 02:58.700
If I want to include both these characters into my longest comment subsequent in both of them.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.000
Both of them have to be equal, right?

03:01.310 --> 03:02.870
The first is to include.

03:04.660 --> 03:05.050
But.

03:06.050 --> 03:06.650
Characters.

03:07.250 --> 03:10.520
What if I include both these characters in the longest comments up sequence?

03:10.550 --> 03:15.560
Then I would simply say included Please give me the longest comment.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.500
Subsequent switches from this remaining things.

03:19.220 --> 03:19.490
Hey.

03:21.080 --> 03:25.170
Which is f i plus one common g plus one normalize.

03:26.050 --> 03:28.970
If if I'm including both the characters, they have to be equal.

03:33.630 --> 03:33.900
Eight.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.440
So the answer simply lies here that.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.170
Included both of them.

03:39.190 --> 03:42.220
Give me what is the longest moments of sequence from these two places?

03:42.400 --> 03:46.560
Normal pain and this recording functional itself.

03:46.570 --> 03:49.520
Doing so, we are only considering one transition here.

03:50.350 --> 03:52.300
Now this is the first option we have.

03:52.780 --> 03:54.890
What is the part of the second option is what is the second?

03:54.970 --> 03:57.850
The next option then are equal.

03:58.600 --> 04:03.760
If then are then and we won't include them in my longest subsequent because they are not equal, because

04:03.760 --> 04:06.160
we are saying it is the longest common subsequent rate.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.970
Common means that they both have to be equal included into my sequence.

04:10.270 --> 04:13.330
What I'll do is I won't include them in the way of sequence.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.630
So if I'm not including, that means exclude.

04:18.730 --> 04:19.390
The characters.

04:19.690 --> 04:20.020
Eight.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.540
If I'm excluding a character, what does it mean?

04:26.550 --> 04:31.470
I can edit, exclude it, I can edit, exclude this, or I can exclude both of them.

04:33.490 --> 04:36.070
So right now, both of these characters are equal.

04:36.070 --> 04:40.450
So let me take another example, which is, let's say X and Y.

04:40.810 --> 04:49.000
Hey, so they considered about this particular things or this these two things and what other options

04:49.000 --> 04:49.510
do I have?

04:49.960 --> 04:52.720
And they don't include this X or don't include this.

04:53.350 --> 04:57.610
But hey, so if I don't include this X, what does it mean?

04:57.610 --> 05:00.850
What is the longest common subsequent if I don't include this x?

05:02.310 --> 05:04.620
From the remaining string and the wasting.

05:04.920 --> 05:05.940
The answer is simple.

05:05.940 --> 05:13.770
It is f i bluesman vi why I'm doing I bluesman because right now I use over here I plus one is over

05:13.770 --> 05:14.040
here.

05:14.070 --> 05:19.470
That means I'm talking about this thing now that I'm not including X, but tell me what are the longest

05:19.470 --> 05:22.200
common subsegments from the forward thing?

05:22.200 --> 05:23.610
So basically it's just a problem.

05:23.940 --> 05:28.140
And tell me what is the longest common subsequent from this particular string, which is.

05:29.040 --> 05:34.080
So here I'm including I'm trying to include this way, but I'm actually trying to exclude one x.

05:34.680 --> 05:34.950
Okay.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.820
So here the recursive solution we have is a plus one and G.

05:38.820 --> 05:43.320
So yeah, I haven't moved G forward because I'm only excluding X.

05:44.340 --> 05:47.490
From the longest comment subsequent eight is.

05:48.530 --> 05:49.910
If I exclude.

05:51.950 --> 05:52.370
The.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.250
This character, which is that the Edith character.

05:56.250 --> 05:56.530
Right.

05:56.830 --> 05:59.050
Right now is over here, days away here.

05:59.070 --> 06:04.320
So what I did was the length of the longest comments I've seen of both these things can be either exclude

06:04.320 --> 06:05.910
X or exclude Y.

06:06.630 --> 06:07.830
I'd exclude both of them.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.550
Okay, so let's exclude Y.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.970
What does it mean that it doesn't move forward?

06:12.480 --> 06:12.700
Right.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.680
Because it still s is this thing only and I'm only excluding y.

06:16.710 --> 06:21.330
So if I exclude y, I just I'm just worried about the forward part of it.

06:21.570 --> 06:25.140
And I'm saying you can't take this thing and tell me where the third longest common subsequent is,

06:25.140 --> 06:26.490
because this cannot be included.

06:27.090 --> 06:30.210
So here I have a fourth icon, my plus one.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.620
And what was the third approach?

06:33.280 --> 06:36.970
The third approach was very simple and it was f off.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.860
And that is exclude both of them.

06:40.370 --> 06:40.470
Okay.

06:40.510 --> 06:42.410
So if I'm excluding both of them, that means.

06:43.350 --> 06:43.440
The.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.520
Tell me the answer.

06:44.820 --> 06:45.060
What?

06:45.060 --> 06:46.380
This thing and this thing.

06:47.100 --> 06:53.580
So this is simply FFI five plus one day plus the whatever is a maximum of these three characters.

06:54.860 --> 06:55.490
I take them?

06:56.600 --> 06:58.880
What is whatever is the maximum of these three values?

06:59.300 --> 07:07.490
I simply included into my current answer, which is f if I got my g i we are getting this if I and g

07:07.490 --> 07:10.340
and then include both of them into my longest common six subsequent.

07:10.340 --> 07:11.690
So it will be one plus something.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.110
I would exclude this or this.

07:16.390 --> 07:17.440
I exclude both of them.

07:17.920 --> 07:25.240
Right now, some of you might be worried about this particular statement that how come this statement

07:25.240 --> 07:27.100
is being included?

07:27.520 --> 07:29.410
Well, I hope you remember about.

07:31.670 --> 07:33.860
I talked about optimal substructure.

07:38.210 --> 07:39.690
What is an optimal substructure?

07:40.340 --> 07:44.990
That means we don't want to go on those places which are unnecessary for us.

07:46.510 --> 07:46.840
Right.

07:47.290 --> 07:47.620
Why?

07:47.650 --> 07:56.470
Why is it unnecessary wise if I plus one comedy plus one unnecessary in this case because case whenever

07:56.470 --> 08:02.680
f I plus one G's being called whenever f of libelous when Jay's been called.

08:02.980 --> 08:03.550
And these are.

08:04.640 --> 08:09.950
Then this f of eight plus one j will automatically consider f of five plus one g.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.220
In itself.

08:13.630 --> 08:13.800
Okay.

08:13.820 --> 08:16.820
So let's say this function was this particular part was being called.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.040
And then in this he excluded the Jones character, so he will simply go left by Brisbane.

08:22.040 --> 08:31.190
The Brisbane implied otherwise f of I go major plus one which is f I go Brisbane you know, also considered

08:31.580 --> 08:33.440
the I Brisbane to Brisbane part.

08:34.450 --> 08:34.840
Why?

08:35.470 --> 08:35.860
Because.

08:36.660 --> 08:36.990
What is?

08:37.020 --> 08:37.890
I'm a jobless one.

08:37.980 --> 08:40.170
It means I'm excluding the budget character.

08:41.070 --> 08:46.650
If I've excluded this, then in the next particular iteration, in the next particular recursion in

08:46.650 --> 08:52.860
F, if I go my depression, this can be called which is F of I plus one comedy +18.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.930
So basically the third is kind of.

08:56.060 --> 09:02.200
One less to say that this this was called and then this was called within itself.

09:02.550 --> 09:02.830
Right.

09:03.940 --> 09:06.250
Or let's take it in the reverse order.

09:06.520 --> 09:12.550
It can be that what's called an end to this one was quite late, so it's basically one plus two.

09:13.180 --> 09:15.970
So we don't have to worry about this transition.

09:16.360 --> 09:22.090
It's kind of a two step transition that we are not including this and not including this.

09:24.640 --> 09:30.280
We just have to worry about one step transition that let's not included in the next record this stack

09:30.280 --> 09:34.270
when in four, five plus one, he will automatically consider it.

09:35.590 --> 09:37.690
Let's not call this the.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.940
Let's not include that idiot who.

09:41.840 --> 09:42.220
If I'm.

09:42.560 --> 09:47.810
It's like don't include the first part, don't include the second part or I can click on it.

09:48.060 --> 09:51.590
It's just to avoid one extra recursive call.

09:52.010 --> 09:52.640
We are.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.070
We don't need it.

09:54.080 --> 09:54.350
Right?

09:54.350 --> 09:54.950
We don't need it.

09:54.950 --> 09:56.060
It's not optimal.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.030
Subsection, of course, that you can call it will work.

09:59.690 --> 10:00.680
I'm not saying it won't work.

10:00.680 --> 10:04.700
It will work great, but it's not optimally optimal to use this one.

10:04.970 --> 10:09.770
I'm just explaining this because this is the correct recursive approach.

10:11.350 --> 10:11.500
Right.

10:11.710 --> 10:12.940
And why is this not included?

10:12.940 --> 10:19.150
Because it is already considered an F of one g and this will already be considered and therefore it

10:19.150 --> 10:20.530
will already be considered.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.890
So it's kind of two steps deeper, not one step deeper.

10:25.430 --> 10:25.720
Eight.

10:27.890 --> 10:28.640
So.

10:30.150 --> 10:31.140
Let's go to this part.

10:31.620 --> 10:36.360
Let's do let's start with the recursive approach and then we'll trace back from the recursive approach

10:36.360 --> 10:36.720
itself.

10:37.260 --> 10:40.170
So what we're doing is in give.

10:42.310 --> 10:43.840
Longish comment subsequent.

10:44.970 --> 10:45.270
Eight.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.010
And here I am, Angie.

10:50.480 --> 10:50.960
So simply.

10:50.960 --> 10:51.770
Let's copy.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.370
One input.

10:56.810 --> 11:00.560
So here we have being S and E.

11:00.950 --> 11:03.140
Let's also take and compare.

11:04.590 --> 11:12.660
And it's in both the strings as e and he goes to his large size Emmy goes to the size.

11:14.790 --> 11:15.100
Yeah.

11:15.120 --> 11:20.190
And I will simply say that the length or let's not take the length.

11:21.930 --> 11:29.220
And okay and is equals to give and see is and what I'll have is I'll have S&amp;P to be passed on over here.

11:32.220 --> 11:33.960
So this will give me the land of dentists.

11:34.770 --> 11:36.420
What was the cases that I have?

11:38.160 --> 11:41.760
If as I is equals to a teacher, then it is.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.290
Simply, let's say, answer.

11:46.180 --> 11:47.590
Initially, let's call it zero.

11:47.590 --> 11:53.770
And so it goes to max off answer karma or whatever I'm getting from the forward part.

11:53.770 --> 11:56.020
If both of them are equal, it is simply give Celsius.

11:57.610 --> 12:02.920
I plus one comedy +18 because I'm including both these characters into Miles's.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.920
Otherwise it is max off on the coma.

12:06.690 --> 12:12.130
We have three things that are onset of coma, so I don't think that we are getting Max to its remove

12:12.130 --> 12:12.550
Max.

12:13.740 --> 12:15.660
Eight because it is a four.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.980
Here I have Max of two things which are.

12:23.330 --> 12:25.150
I pledge one day.

12:27.880 --> 12:28.750
I go 20 zipless.

12:30.310 --> 12:30.580
Now.

12:31.260 --> 12:32.560
I assume you didn't answer.

12:33.560 --> 12:33.720
Well.

12:33.860 --> 12:36.530
So it is given to us plus one because we including it.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.460
They are normal, small code.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.320
And now we have tried the best cases rate.

12:42.650 --> 12:49.130
But before checking I and what we have to make sure that I enjoy within the limits which is I should

12:49.130 --> 12:51.580
realize any less than N and j should be less than it.

12:52.250 --> 12:55.370
So just making some basic cases Isaac was doing.

12:56.190 --> 12:56.550
And.

12:57.690 --> 12:58.640
Daisy goes to him.

12:58.650 --> 12:59.400
What does it mean?

13:00.540 --> 13:05.550
Both of them are on their I'm guessing they are on the envelope with the strings and simply red and

13:05.550 --> 13:07.350
zero because they are on them destroying.

13:09.100 --> 13:09.860
And the.

13:12.190 --> 13:12.520
Okay.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.090
Working with us.

13:14.090 --> 13:15.630
It can be a case though.

13:15.830 --> 13:16.870
The second best case can we.

13:17.180 --> 13:19.400
I is within the limit, but does equal to him.

13:19.950 --> 13:20.140
Okay.

13:20.180 --> 13:21.020
So if I.

13:21.290 --> 13:25.610
If Daisy were to him, what I would simply do is I simply.

13:27.380 --> 13:29.690
Return zero again because he's empty.

13:29.900 --> 13:32.420
And if Isaac was to end, that means again.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.210
Eyes on the end of se.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.500
I simply didn't even hate.

13:36.830 --> 13:37.760
So what does this mean?

13:37.870 --> 13:39.740
What do these three base cases mean?

13:40.130 --> 13:41.720
That they can be combined together?

13:42.380 --> 13:46.220
So if Isaiah was to win or Jay-Z goes to him, it was simply written.

13:49.940 --> 13:55.910
Well, because if one of them gets empty or both of them gets empty, the longest common subsequent

13:55.920 --> 13:56.480
would be zero.

13:57.570 --> 13:57.730
Okay.

13:57.780 --> 14:03.180
So that's the normal biscuits case that we have then will simply form that it goes in relation and have

14:03.180 --> 14:05.490
it answer and then will simply didn't answer.

14:07.610 --> 14:09.440
So no magic works in the goal.

14:09.740 --> 14:14.390
Okay, so not S&amp;M or passing the strings will take a lot of time to parse them.

14:15.110 --> 14:15.530
Let's.

14:16.940 --> 14:17.490
The elderly.

14:19.880 --> 14:23.390
So the lender, the longest Goldman Sachs thing is three in this case.

14:23.810 --> 14:24.950
So I hope you got this.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.410
Include or exclude.

14:27.890 --> 14:28.760
These are the two guesses.

14:29.570 --> 14:29.780
Eight.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.330
And after this, what we need to do is.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.250
Very simply, we need to trace back rates.

14:35.260 --> 14:40.300
I'm tracing back integration and I already knew how to trace back in the tabulation approach, which

14:40.300 --> 14:42.230
you can easily do they.

14:43.450 --> 14:51.820
So let's say let's write a function called Trace Back eight and this function will actually form will

14:51.820 --> 14:56.320
give me a string and I'll simply be like rendered string, right?

14:56.320 --> 15:00.880
So let's see, let's make a third string called resultant and now let's say is back.

15:00.880 --> 15:01.120
Right.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.770
And it stays back from zero zero.

15:04.970 --> 15:05.490
Know how to.

15:05.490 --> 15:06.150
It is very good.

15:06.150 --> 15:09.450
It's the trace back function is exactly similar to this.

15:11.320 --> 15:15.070
DB Functionally, it will have the same arguments, but it will just.

15:16.270 --> 15:19.190
But yeah, it will just go in one particular direction.

15:19.210 --> 15:22.360
We're not going all the directions as it's going here.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.280
It will just go in one particular direction.

15:24.920 --> 15:25.140
Okay.

15:25.330 --> 15:29.140
So what, what what how will it work if say is a good strategic.

15:29.530 --> 15:31.060
So just simply.

15:32.470 --> 15:34.580
Trace back to.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.890
I go, my dear.

15:36.830 --> 15:38.120
Plus one in both the cases.

15:39.610 --> 15:44.200
And if this is the case, I simply return, not zero.

15:44.230 --> 15:44.990
Just simply read him.

15:45.850 --> 15:50.110
Otherwise, if this is the case, that means there's trace back here and in resultant.

15:51.620 --> 15:57.710
Just upend this character, which I'm thinking in the longest comment subsequent so which is essay and

15:57.710 --> 15:58.930
we address they shortage.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.020
I'm just upending it.

16:02.450 --> 16:03.480
If they're not equal.

16:04.700 --> 16:05.780
Where do I need to go?

16:06.230 --> 16:06.680
So here.

16:06.680 --> 16:07.580
I'll have two guesses.

16:08.030 --> 16:08.390
If.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.220
This is the.

16:12.840 --> 16:18.660
If this video is a plus one JS the case then I'll simply go and trace back from my bliss when there

16:18.660 --> 16:21.750
was originally going to be from comedy plus one night.

16:22.160 --> 16:22.740
So if.

16:25.110 --> 16:30.180
If Alcaeus, which is a plus one comedy is equal to.

16:32.390 --> 16:34.510
Give and see is a committee.

16:35.180 --> 16:41.180
That means if the current value which was being found what came from this particular location, that

16:41.180 --> 16:48.680
is I going to replace one and simply place back a plus one go my g rate as it is back to.

16:51.670 --> 16:52.600
I commend zipless.

16:53.940 --> 16:56.110
Well, it's just very simple.

16:56.130 --> 17:00.060
If they were equal, then of course the answer did come from this place.

17:00.090 --> 17:01.410
I presume the obvious one.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.450
If they were not equal, then I had two options.

17:03.840 --> 17:11.310
So if the answer came from a plus one comedy, that was the maximum among two of I plus ones in I comedy

17:11.310 --> 17:17.460
plus one if it was maximum justice back to this place, otherwise stays back to this place normal rate

17:17.730 --> 17:22.810
and whenever I'm just including I get it down is simply a binding in the resultant eight.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.430
So let's simply see out resultant.

17:29.580 --> 17:30.240
Be right.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.450
It'll be fine.

17:32.770 --> 17:33.380
It can be.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.170
Can also be done.

17:34.170 --> 17:36.090
So we can also be dance in a.

17:37.110 --> 17:42.760
So what's happening in yoga is I'm simply adding a character at the end of the resident.

17:43.290 --> 17:44.280
So it's kind of.

17:46.310 --> 17:46.520
Yeah.

17:46.520 --> 17:47.990
It's going to give you giving me a.

17:50.030 --> 17:56.390
It's kind of like giving me an opposite solution vibe because I'm going into It's breakfast and then

17:56.390 --> 17:57.140
I remember it.

17:57.410 --> 18:03.320
That means it's going in the recursive approach and it's going into a recursion, and when it's coming

18:03.320 --> 18:07.730
back, it is then upending into the return, which is already modified.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.970
So it's simply upended before calling trees back.

18:14.050 --> 18:14.310
Right.

18:14.350 --> 18:16.540
So now, as you can see, I got the baby by.

18:16.540 --> 18:17.410
Why is this happening?

18:17.860 --> 18:18.160
It was.

18:19.260 --> 18:19.530
What?

18:19.530 --> 18:24.600
I'm upending it in the results and then I'm going to make a dent further.

18:24.690 --> 18:29.670
Characters will be upended after bending the current character, and I'm already moving forward.

18:30.030 --> 18:34.780
What happened was I first called his back and then I opened it when I called Chris back.

18:34.800 --> 18:39.210
All the other characters were appended to it and then this character was ending at the end of it.

18:39.570 --> 18:41.190
So that's why it was the reverse.

18:41.730 --> 18:43.770
Eight So I've got this.

18:44.160 --> 18:49.230
And now there's just one last thing, which is this is normal recursion and I want to memorize it.

18:49.680 --> 18:50.940
So how can I mean, what is it?

18:52.050 --> 18:52.980
What are the arguments?

18:53.220 --> 18:56.190
They're independent arguments that I committee made.

18:56.490 --> 19:01.030
So just so let's just memorize it from a comedy perspective itself.

19:01.050 --> 19:02.730
So let's call memo.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.150
And.

19:04.540 --> 19:04.960
And.

19:05.590 --> 19:06.490
And so this.

19:07.150 --> 19:08.290
Let's take this to be.

19:12.230 --> 19:13.700
3008.

19:14.650 --> 19:17.950
And before calling it Sears latest memo stated.

19:25.410 --> 19:25.680
Right.

19:26.030 --> 19:29.010
So some of you might be wondering, why am I giving you that?

19:29.010 --> 19:33.090
Because if called by I giving, I'm very much trying to form the recursive relation again.

19:33.300 --> 19:38.160
I'm not doing that in just for my ease of explanation that I'm taking this because I've got.

19:38.490 --> 19:38.940
Which will.

19:40.120 --> 19:45.240
Because it's already calculated it will directly return back to the memorization rate.

19:45.370 --> 19:48.450
So what happens here is I say I is equal to memorizing.

19:50.010 --> 19:51.380
And yeah.

19:52.170 --> 19:58.650
So if answer is not equal to minus one, it's simply written answer.

19:59.730 --> 20:05.250
Otherwise, if it is minus one, it will be modified do and it will be returned.

20:05.880 --> 20:09.150
Well, so this should work according to me.

20:09.930 --> 20:11.150
And it's related again.

20:12.660 --> 20:13.480
Yeah, maybe.

20:13.530 --> 20:15.060
Let's take some other examples.

20:17.980 --> 20:20.650
For some of you, this approach might be easier.

20:21.110 --> 20:21.340
Hey.

20:22.750 --> 20:27.010
What all transitions get to me and that include both of them are don't include any of them.

20:27.540 --> 20:30.520
If I'm not learning any of them, then what other means of not including them?

20:31.690 --> 20:31.990
So.

20:32.830 --> 20:33.400
And that's it.

20:34.150 --> 20:34.630
It is.

20:34.630 --> 20:37.840
We have doubly, I think, answered it.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.420
And from Izzard point of view, we will have.

20:41.590 --> 20:41.910
Hmm.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.080
Missing.

20:43.350 --> 20:44.070
And it's submitted.

20:45.470 --> 20:46.910
And check it's working or not.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.170
So I'm not quitting the.

20:50.110 --> 20:50.830
What do we call it?

20:51.310 --> 20:52.540
Yeah, the tabulation form.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.580
I'm not trying to call it out.

20:57.240 --> 20:58.920
I'm leaving that to you.

20:59.700 --> 21:04.050
With that, you could do it by making a table.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.620
It's that easy already explaining to do just some analysis.

21:07.860 --> 21:09.150
And then you have to trace back.

21:09.480 --> 21:12.060
While using using bi loops made.

21:13.570 --> 21:14.050
So.

21:14.050 --> 21:16.470
Yeah, so completely executed.

21:16.480 --> 21:17.370
Correct answer.

21:18.330 --> 21:18.690
Great.

21:18.690 --> 21:21.540
So I hope you have understood how to trace back.

21:22.230 --> 21:28.170
I like in a better way and by tracing my only you can understand dynamic programming led to your solving

21:28.170 --> 21:30.210
when problem you're not able to do it just.

21:31.410 --> 21:33.870
See someone solution in the table.

21:33.870 --> 21:34.500
Entry is back.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.420
Where is it coming from?

21:36.900 --> 21:38.610
And then you can understand that.

21:38.610 --> 21:38.970
Yes.

21:39.480 --> 21:42.030
Now that you understand, what's the logic behind it?

21:43.160 --> 21:44.390
Well, go.

21:44.540 --> 21:45.200
Thank you, everyone.

21:45.530 --> 21:46.100
In the next block.
