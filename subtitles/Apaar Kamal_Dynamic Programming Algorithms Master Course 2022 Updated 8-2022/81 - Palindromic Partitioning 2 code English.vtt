WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:01.030
Yeah.

00:01.100 --> 00:04.130
And this conveys the recursive approach, right?

00:04.490 --> 00:08.660
And in that also what we can do is let's write a function called this palindrome.

00:10.010 --> 00:16.970
And in that we will simply say, okay, so it will check whether something is a palindrome or not.

00:17.420 --> 00:21.500
And let's say the substring starts are dying and today this will be nothing.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.230
But we already discussed this part that.

00:25.240 --> 00:28.540
The insides of this substring should be a palindrome.

00:29.080 --> 00:29.770
Oh, yeah.

00:30.190 --> 00:32.680
A plus one and minus one.

00:32.680 --> 00:33.700
That means a substring.

00:34.180 --> 00:39.280
If a substring from outward is a palindrome, the inside stink should also be a palindrome.

00:39.280 --> 00:39.580
Right.

00:39.880 --> 00:40.300
And.

00:41.250 --> 00:47.220
The second condition is that this ice should be equal to the sea.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.510
Ice should be equal to.

00:49.410 --> 00:49.920
As you.

00:51.210 --> 00:54.330
Input aid on the basis of this.

00:54.340 --> 00:59.410
What we'll do is we will simply put it out and let's take it.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.680
Well, uh, yeah.

01:04.180 --> 01:05.650
In this case, the minimum will be zero.

01:05.650 --> 01:14.530
Let's check for if we initially were to have I'll take thing as an input etch and the solution and here

01:14.530 --> 01:22.930
it will be nothing but in resulting in which is the minimum instead of saying let's see out each document

01:23.410 --> 01:25.910
correctly and uh.

01:26.050 --> 01:26.440
It's.

01:27.750 --> 01:28.320
As.

01:30.320 --> 01:35.600
It's as okay this as is because we have to use it.

01:36.170 --> 01:38.330
Return let's read up on single day violence.

01:38.330 --> 01:39.350
Pass the index zero.

01:39.350 --> 01:39.620
Do it.

01:40.340 --> 01:45.740
Well, I have this function d b in which I will have some particular index on which I am.

01:45.740 --> 01:46.850
We can alter quality.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.390
Now let's write.

01:51.380 --> 01:52.790
Let's find out the substance.

01:52.790 --> 01:53.090
Right.

01:54.110 --> 01:56.770
So what we're doing will soon starting in the point a g.

01:56.810 --> 01:57.800
It starts from I.

01:58.370 --> 02:01.130
It will go till less then as third size.

02:01.130 --> 02:02.390
And it will simply say.

02:03.580 --> 02:07.540
It will simply check whether it is a palindrome or not.

02:08.680 --> 02:12.040
It will simply check whether it's palindrome from a G.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.490
And how will you check whether it is a printer or not?

02:16.520 --> 02:17.570
We'll have another function.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.060
Let's make another function called.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.290
All is palindrome.

02:28.320 --> 02:33.760
And we all know how we defined this radical installation here, which is nothing but a.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.000
It's palindrome.

02:36.240 --> 02:36.570
Okay.

02:36.630 --> 02:40.050
Let me quickly write it that it will simply return.

02:40.050 --> 02:47.370
Whether I plus one to J minus one is also a palindrome, and as size equals to issue eight.

02:47.550 --> 02:52.530
If say the base cases for this if I equals today, it is simply a.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.120
It is simply too late.

02:56.450 --> 03:02.900
But if ice equals two j minus one, that means if they are consecutive, then we'll simply return whether

03:03.530 --> 03:05.170
size equals to SGA or not.

03:06.240 --> 03:06.510
Well.

03:07.320 --> 03:07.710
So.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.630
Right now, it is still a.

03:12.790 --> 03:18.040
Because the function I want memories this palindromic function right so let me right memorization is

03:18.040 --> 03:18.370
needed.

03:19.480 --> 03:20.320
More easing is needed.

03:20.650 --> 03:26.700
And after that, basically what it is, it is wonderful to be inside it, to really be made.

03:27.340 --> 03:27.550
Okay.

03:27.570 --> 03:28.960
We will check that later.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.930
So right now, what I've got I've got that.

03:31.930 --> 03:39.820
Yes, there's a palindrome from I do g what is implicit I will say go and tell me the minimum number

03:39.820 --> 03:45.580
of palindromes from the string J plus one Thailand eight and whatever the minimum that I receive, I'll

03:45.580 --> 03:47.020
just add plus one after it.

03:48.250 --> 03:48.490
Well.

03:48.640 --> 03:54.760
So here, let me quickly take some answer value, which is in the worst case, let's say.

03:56.310 --> 03:59.490
And minus one or it's take any maximal.

03:59.640 --> 04:08.040
It doesn't matter so and then will simply take a minimum of all those deep values and whatever is the

04:08.040 --> 04:08.900
minimum that I've got.

04:08.910 --> 04:11.850
I'd simply add one here plus equals to it.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.850
And what's the base case?

04:14.880 --> 04:18.540
Base cases simple indicate that it is, as George says.

04:18.900 --> 04:25.420
Then I'll simply return zero in because we have an empty string and we don't want to have some partitions.

04:25.980 --> 04:28.260
So right now what is the situation?

04:28.290 --> 04:32.100
Okay, let me quickly build it and let's see what we are getting and we will discuss it.

04:34.570 --> 04:34.950
Okay.

04:36.730 --> 04:38.890
Use of undeclared and indifferent i.

04:40.170 --> 04:42.510
To make your day only then overindex.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.930
So here you can see what we have got.

04:47.930 --> 04:56.120
We have got up to date, but the output should be one rate of what is this two giving me is two is giving

04:56.120 --> 04:56.690
me that.

04:56.690 --> 04:58.970
What are the total partitions rate?

04:59.330 --> 05:03.230
If I have no partitions, then what will be the answer?

05:03.470 --> 05:07.850
The minimum number of cards which are required right now we are getting minimum number of partitions,

05:07.850 --> 05:08.150
right?

05:08.330 --> 05:11.330
So the minimum number of cards will be answer minus one.

05:11.390 --> 05:15.980
So instead of putting on three over here, let's just say DP zero, minus one.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.110
But I know we have now we have the correct answer.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.220
I was just giving you partition aid.

05:23.150 --> 05:24.220
So, yeah.

05:26.510 --> 05:30.030
So now let me quickly memo.

05:30.140 --> 05:32.450
Is this above solution as well as this one?

05:33.290 --> 05:38.060
So here you can see that it's a 2D solution, which is.

05:38.410 --> 05:43.070
But tell me about this thing I do, J.R., palindrome or not later will just simply memorize it.

05:43.550 --> 05:50.600
Well, we already know how to memorize this solution, which is a vector vector memo and it's midi size

05:50.630 --> 05:50.840
it.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.090
Memo and.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.410
As start size.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.490
My mom, Victor and.

06:00.470 --> 06:01.970
Esther sighs.

06:02.570 --> 06:02.880
Yeah.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.400
And shared space from a minus one.

06:09.210 --> 06:13.320
And this is a memo that this is.

06:14.590 --> 06:19.300
I would say they're delighted to see so many rules inside that island of activities filled with minus

06:19.300 --> 06:24.910
one, which also had these many islands cool and in play.

06:24.940 --> 06:26.770
What we'll do is we'll simply see.

06:28.640 --> 06:29.030
That.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.660
If my mom.

06:32.800 --> 06:33.130
Okay.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.020
Let's do this.

06:34.030 --> 06:43.600
After the cases if memo I did not equal to minus one written memo e.g. I'm doing this to avoid recommendations,

06:44.200 --> 06:47.290
to avoid recalculations in writing programming.

06:47.620 --> 06:50.290
We all know how and why memorization is useful.

06:51.530 --> 06:53.210
So this is palindromic.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.890
And we have on end.

06:54.890 --> 06:58.910
And I think, yeah, this should work well and.

07:00.430 --> 07:01.690
This is one memorization.

07:01.720 --> 07:07.560
Now you know that this is another function which is giving me minimum partitions.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.450
Eight even I need to memorize it itself.

07:10.900 --> 07:11.230
Why?

07:11.260 --> 07:15.310
Because you can easily see that there will be many overlapping problems.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.000
Because we can region state a room many different ways.

07:21.850 --> 07:23.350
So let me just memorize it again.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.840
And for that, what we can do is we can take.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.420
And the Richter.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.970
Let's call it memo one.

07:31.060 --> 07:34.090
And let me say, is it more dark?

07:36.450 --> 07:38.030
The side is.

07:38.930 --> 07:43.370
And start size and you Charlottesville it one minus one.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.460
So what we can see if my.

07:48.390 --> 07:49.260
When I.

07:50.720 --> 07:50.990
Okay.

07:50.990 --> 07:51.770
It's memo one.

07:52.130 --> 07:52.350
I.

07:54.580 --> 07:57.520
If it is not equal to minus one, then return.

07:58.620 --> 07:59.220
Memo.

07:59.370 --> 08:01.770
One I advise.

08:07.550 --> 08:07.850
Okay.

08:07.940 --> 08:08.960
Something missing?

08:09.940 --> 08:13.060
Meredith says, okay, it's the size.

08:16.730 --> 08:17.660
So give me a good one.

08:17.660 --> 08:20.520
So now let's find figure out the complexity of this solution.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.100
So I'm calling Mingo Martins.

08:22.100 --> 08:26.690
Mingo doing nothing is deciding to vectors, to not be complicated involved.

08:27.530 --> 08:34.250
And now we can see that we have a basically this function will calculate everything once.

08:34.380 --> 08:34.590
Right.

08:34.610 --> 08:35.840
So how many states are there?

08:36.310 --> 08:37.010
The states that.

08:38.450 --> 08:38.870
It's.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.290
Off and that is ideal as dirt plays minus one.

08:43.560 --> 08:47.070
But as you can see, there is another work going on inside it.

08:47.220 --> 08:53.640
So this fall is taking how much time off and in the worst case, that means it's this day starting from

08:53.640 --> 08:59.380
zero and going to land right before Wednesday time doing it or work inside of it.

08:59.400 --> 09:04.440
I'm just checking whether I do this palindrome or not by using this method.

09:04.740 --> 09:06.270
Again, we can see that.

09:06.510 --> 09:09.270
Let's say if I have method guard, it is palindrome.

09:09.540 --> 09:13.050
Then what is the total complexity of this method?

09:13.800 --> 09:20.610
So this method will have a total complexity of, of and into and it because as you can see, we are

09:20.610 --> 09:21.360
memorizing it.

09:21.750 --> 09:29.530
So the next time we call any of this grace, that means if any, are ego images being called again eight

09:29.770 --> 09:30.630
and what will happen?

09:30.900 --> 09:34.200
It will simply return from this particular part.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.560
That means it's memory straight.

09:35.850 --> 09:38.760
The human daughter states idea the end square and square.

09:38.760 --> 09:42.900
It states for this and or in states for this and or in calculation for this.

09:43.300 --> 09:50.190
Basically, all of this all of this function is doing and square time complexity with or in space complexity.

09:50.730 --> 09:51.030
Right.

09:51.240 --> 09:54.240
And what this also is palindromic function.

09:54.240 --> 09:59.400
I'm just taking the complexity to it and square it because the eternal and square states.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.330
And this it is.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.190
And square less and square.

10:04.310 --> 10:05.780
So end when states.

10:06.750 --> 10:11.730
Into any workplace and square for palindromic parties is palindrome function.

10:13.550 --> 10:17.870
Is palindrome eight the total will be and square only.

10:18.530 --> 10:26.300
I hope you're realizing this problem and a very nice problem which can be solved, which is solvable

10:26.300 --> 10:27.500
by using dynamic programming.

10:28.110 --> 10:32.090
And yeah, thank you all and see you in the next part.
