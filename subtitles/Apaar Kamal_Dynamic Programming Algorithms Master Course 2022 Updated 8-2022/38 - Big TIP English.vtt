hello, everyone.

1
00:01.540 --> 00:03.370
I have a small tip for you all.

2
00:03.910 --> 00:07.930
So the tip is very simple that if I have.

3
00:08.350 --> 00:11.560
So now we are beginning with lots of dynamic programming problems.

4
00:11.560 --> 00:14.800
And as you know, the we have strict time limits.

5
00:15.790 --> 00:22.440
So I won't be coding all the problems in both the bottom up manner and the recursion plus memoization.

6
00:22.450 --> 00:24.160
That is the top down right.

7
00:24.460 --> 00:26.770
I won't be coding all the problems in both the ways.

8
00:27.900 --> 00:32.010
Of course I will be coding all the problems, but but only in one of these ways.

9
00:32.370 --> 00:35.760
Right, either I code it bottom up or I'll code it top down.

10
00:35.760 --> 00:39.930
I just decide that whichever is the tough one I'll code it

11
00:40.080 --> 00:44.760
But what I want you to do is if you want to get the best out of this course, what you can do is you

12
00:44.760 --> 00:50.940
can simply try out the other, approach yourself and try to submit the problems online.

13
00:51.870 --> 00:59.640
So basically what I'm saying is if I have done the memoisation + recursion, the I've coded it recursively,

14
00:59.880 --> 01:06.990
then what you can do is you can try and code it in the bottom up manner right because in that way it's beneficial

15
01:06.990 --> 01:12.510
for you only that you will realize that there are different ways to code the same problem.

16
01:12.510 --> 01:12.780
Right.

17
01:12.930 --> 01:20.940
And maybe that will help you get more familiar and more, you know, get some deep details of the problem

18
01:20.940 --> 01:21.220
as i said

19
01:21.960 --> 01:22.110
So.

20
01:22.110 --> 01:22.870
Thank you, everyone.

21
01:23.940 --> 01:24.510
All the best.
