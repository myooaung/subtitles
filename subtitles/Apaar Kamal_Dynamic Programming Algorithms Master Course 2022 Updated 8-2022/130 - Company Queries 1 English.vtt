00:00.560 --> 00:01.250
Hello, everyone.

00:01.340 --> 00:04.540
Let's take this problem called company queries first.

00:04.970 --> 00:08.540
And after this, we can take company queries too also.

00:08.870 --> 00:12.410
But we'll see, like how to solve these types of problems.

00:12.410 --> 00:18.380
And whatever you learn from the problem, you will be able to implement it in the next room as well.

00:19.140 --> 00:25.940
I'm just taking this problem because it requires a little bit of dynamic programming to process.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.900
So let's see, what does this do mind?

00:29.780 --> 00:37.370
A company has an employee who forms a tree hierarchy where each employee has a boss except for a general

00:37.370 --> 00:37.820
director.

00:38.420 --> 00:38.790
Renault.

00:38.810 --> 00:39.040
Right.

00:39.050 --> 00:40.040
Who is a general director.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.190
Now it is rude, not right, because he does not has a boss.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.510
So he's a general editor.

00:44.900 --> 00:48.740
Now your task is to process Q queries of the form.

00:48.740 --> 00:49.790
Who is the employee?

00:50.600 --> 00:56.630
Who is employee x e x boss skill levels higher up in the hierarchy.

00:56.870 --> 00:57.140
Right?

00:57.260 --> 01:07.160
So basically what it means is that for any person X who is the cadence instead of him in the above?

01:07.160 --> 01:07.670
T Right.

01:08.330 --> 01:14.690
So I hope you, you are well aware of the system because X is let's see, I'm currently on x, one parent

01:15.260 --> 01:20.750
one above and sister is appearing other one is a grand parent and grand grandparent.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.970
But what is an injustice any.

01:24.230 --> 01:28.720
Anyone who is between the general electorate.

01:28.730 --> 01:33.940
The road north of the tree and Decatur node will depart from the road north of the tree to the current

01:33.950 --> 01:34.180
run.

01:34.190 --> 01:37.940
All those nodes are actually the ancestors.

01:39.820 --> 01:42.760
So let me start with the input here.

01:43.090 --> 01:46.960
And the first line has two integers and in Q the number of employed in queries.

01:47.290 --> 01:47.640
So.

01:48.790 --> 01:53.810
The embroidered number one prominent and hated especially mentioned that one is the gender genetic means.

01:53.810 --> 01:54.950
One is the root note of the tree.

01:54.950 --> 02:00.020
Now you cannot take any other, nor to be rude, nor of the tree, because ancestors would change.

02:00.830 --> 02:03.200
So this problem says that rude note is fixed.

02:03.260 --> 02:04.430
When is it in their letter?

02:04.760 --> 02:05.120
Now.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.500
The next lane head and minus one.

02:06.500 --> 02:10.190
And be just what each employee to do in their bosses.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.740
It's a new type of input, see?

02:13.460 --> 02:15.320
So basically just sees that.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.010
Who is the parent of two?

02:19.280 --> 02:22.130
Who is the parent of three, who is up in indifference on Dylan?

02:22.140 --> 02:26.480
Because now we know one does not have any better and great work to do and will have some parents and

02:26.780 --> 02:28.160
those parents are mentioned in the.

02:29.480 --> 02:29.930
Input.

02:30.260 --> 02:30.620
Correct.

02:30.830 --> 02:33.320
So finally, the rescue lines describing the coyotes.

02:33.680 --> 02:39.260
Each line has to be this X and who is employee X for skill levels higher up.

02:40.320 --> 02:46.970
So if a boss does not exist and print minus one, for example, that he then sister does not exist.

02:47.030 --> 02:48.940
That means it is above the gender letter.

02:49.490 --> 02:50.750
That means it does not exist.

02:51.900 --> 02:55.680
In that case will print minus eight if such a okay.

02:56.520 --> 03:00.450
Now let's understand this constraints and in Q right.

03:00.450 --> 03:04.590
So the number of notes in the tree are 2010 is about five and.

03:04.740 --> 03:06.960
Q The number of queries are also huge.

03:07.680 --> 03:15.690
So what we'll do in this case, we can think of something because we see right that queries are very

03:15.690 --> 03:16.110
high.

03:16.530 --> 03:20.310
So we cannot, you know, just iterate there times above eight.

03:20.610 --> 03:24.350
So for example, let's say I'm on some X, I want to get in Star.

03:24.360 --> 03:29.700
So I just I just find, you know, it read about go above one by one and give the answer because is

03:29.700 --> 03:35.490
also between one in and then in the worst case, the complexity will be coming in.

03:35.490 --> 03:36.720
And that's what we don't want.

03:37.170 --> 03:37.470
Right?

03:37.710 --> 03:39.540
So brute force won't be applied over here.

03:39.960 --> 03:40.350
Now.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.500
Moving on to this in bullets.

03:43.590 --> 03:44.580
Let's frame this in good.

03:44.580 --> 03:46.470
First eight and.

03:48.630 --> 03:48.930
Yeah.

03:49.110 --> 03:54.690
So it is 11345323 equities 51133.

03:54.810 --> 03:56.070
So this is the parent of two.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.000
This is a parent of three.

03:57.000 --> 03:57.870
This is a bit indifferent.

03:57.870 --> 03:58.800
This is a bit into five.

03:58.950 --> 03:59.790
So let's make it three.

03:59.790 --> 04:01.950
That very parent of two is one.

04:02.250 --> 04:05.760
Parent of three is also one parent offered is three.

04:06.720 --> 04:11.190
And parent of five is also 38 now.

04:12.690 --> 04:13.770
1133, two, eight.

04:13.800 --> 04:19.800
Now we have the goods with Ford's vice president Ford's second button enforced heart beating with the

04:19.800 --> 04:25.200
first bit with the first bit into four, three, eight towards the answer three.

04:25.210 --> 04:29.040
Who is the second parent of what one now who is the third parent?

04:29.040 --> 04:31.250
That means one to win one level above.

04:31.490 --> 04:34.530
So we begin to see that there is no third variant of Ford.

04:34.560 --> 04:38.070
That means it simply market is minus one eight.

04:38.130 --> 04:40.640
So that's what we want, three, one and minus.

04:40.650 --> 04:43.370
And I hope the example input and output is clear.

04:43.370 --> 04:43.680
Right.

04:44.010 --> 04:50.590
But to solve this problem we use a special dom called binary lifting, which is not that special, but

04:50.610 --> 04:51.390
it's very easy.

04:53.330 --> 04:55.970
But tell me, what if.

04:56.270 --> 04:56.630
Just.

04:57.890 --> 04:59.750
Just think about it.

04:59.940 --> 05:00.680
So what if.

05:01.100 --> 05:01.340
What?

05:01.340 --> 05:08.980
Every note, if I stored Louise, the notes would is to the power I experienced physically.

05:09.440 --> 05:18.260
For example, let me give you an example to modify for x I had stored X to to the power zero period,

05:18.920 --> 05:19.430
which is.

05:20.550 --> 05:22.230
Nothing but spirit.

05:23.610 --> 05:30.480
And let's see if I also had to receive our first parent, which is that that grandparent, that means

05:30.490 --> 05:31.590
parent spirit trade.

05:32.010 --> 05:35.010
What if I also had to restore the power to fourth parent?

05:36.470 --> 05:40.430
Also to restore the power for three IT parent.

05:41.910 --> 05:49.040
So basically what I'm saying is what if I store X Xs some goodies to the power I experience?

05:49.050 --> 05:53.460
And basically x is binary evidence and so it can be fuzzy.

05:53.460 --> 05:59.670
But inside, you know, between four and eight parent, parent, party, second parent, 64th parent

05:59.670 --> 06:00.120
and so on.

06:00.750 --> 06:06.030
So basically what I'm trying to stories, I'm trying for any X, I'm trying to store to this to the

06:06.030 --> 06:13.860
power jets parent and how can a ordered and also tell me one thing if I'm trying to store it, how will

06:14.370 --> 06:15.270
it benefit us?

06:15.510 --> 06:16.230
We'll see that later.

06:16.230 --> 06:16.530
Right.

06:16.770 --> 06:21.900
But now, you know, just started to understand this point that we are trying to store what every X

06:21.900 --> 06:22.680
but every node.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.410
We are trying to store it to to the power to parent.

06:25.920 --> 06:26.220
Right.

06:26.430 --> 06:30.930
And then just tell me one thing from day will start from zero.

06:32.090 --> 06:32.500
Correct.

06:32.510 --> 06:36.200
They would start from zero and they will go down because of, you know, what I did?

06:37.490 --> 06:47.210
If I said Jay-Z was too late, liquidated, if Jay's greater than the height of the injury rates and

06:47.210 --> 06:52.040
it said Jay's greater than the height of the tree, that means the answers for all the above.

06:52.040 --> 06:57.110
Jay's, if it is greater than height of the tree, it will be minus one because it won't exist.

06:57.230 --> 06:59.060
Because I'm having to raise to the poverty.

07:00.210 --> 07:00.570
Correct?

07:01.170 --> 07:01.710
Basically.

07:02.600 --> 07:09.470
If I say, Oh yeah, so this J will start from zero and they will go till logging by logging.

07:09.470 --> 07:13.750
Because in the worst case, what can happen is that we can be a chain.

07:14.960 --> 07:15.250
Right.

07:15.530 --> 07:17.210
Well, let me give you an example.

07:17.240 --> 07:25.190
So in this case, what is this five West patent, good anthropology zero three, and it is fifth phosphate

07:25.190 --> 07:25.730
and is four.

07:26.330 --> 07:27.020
What is five?

07:27.020 --> 07:31.250
Stewardship about 1 billion, which is its second billion, which is three or it is five.

07:31.700 --> 07:32.810
To raise to the power.

07:33.950 --> 07:35.780
Up2, which is Fort Parent.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.150
One, two, three, four.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.030
We can see this one.

07:38.570 --> 07:39.950
What about five stories?

07:40.070 --> 07:42.890
About three opportunities minus one, which is eight three turned off.

07:43.040 --> 07:43.910
It doesn't exist.

07:44.330 --> 07:49.960
So after this, if I talk about two days to afford it, it'll be minus one and so on for infinity,

07:50.320 --> 07:53.010
the day it makes sense to store.

07:53.270 --> 07:57.710
Starting from zero and going till a particular log in value.

07:57.950 --> 08:02.370
I log base to invalidate so I can see the days less than equal to log in.

08:02.510 --> 08:08.120
I can also say it is less than equal to ceiling of log and we can take one extra day because we know

08:08.120 --> 08:15.110
that log in is not much in our case and is doing 210 days to the power by eight.

08:15.200 --> 08:22.460
And if I try to make some log of it now to log base to two window tenders to the above five, what will

08:22.460 --> 08:23.120
be the answer?

08:23.930 --> 08:26.270
Let me calculated quickly.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.160
But it should be a.
