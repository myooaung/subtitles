WEBVTT

00:00.830 --> 00:01.130
Yeah.

00:01.340 --> 00:03.170
So let's go to this problem.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.940
Look, what we have to do is nothing.

00:06.940 --> 00:12.370
We're just find a poverty of a matrix and add everything into my answer.

00:12.920 --> 00:16.000
So let's put it real quick, because we have already done it.

00:16.800 --> 00:21.430
Let's copy the modulo the magic structure that I've already explained.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.700
Copy this, and we'll be using it.

00:26.510 --> 00:26.840
Okay.

00:26.840 --> 00:27.230
So.

00:33.160 --> 00:33.410
Okay.

00:33.670 --> 00:38.980
So here I have a modern size, and I'm only digging more when I'm doing any calculation.

00:39.710 --> 00:40.900
This is the structure matrix.

00:41.650 --> 00:41.950
Cool.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.960
Now let's take the input.

00:45.190 --> 00:47.900
Stake this input and I have to find it's power key.

00:47.920 --> 00:48.270
Right.

00:48.930 --> 00:49.320
So.

00:50.710 --> 00:56.140
Let's call metrics here, and this will be a constructor of it.

00:56.390 --> 00:56.680
Okay.

00:56.710 --> 00:57.610
This is 51.

00:57.610 --> 00:58.390
I've already taken it.

00:58.390 --> 00:58.930
51.

01:00.870 --> 01:02.460
Well, if they will also work with.

01:03.490 --> 01:03.910
Leave.

01:05.080 --> 01:08.110
And go making lipstick and ink as an input.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.250
Now what we need to do.

01:14.580 --> 01:14.740
Yeah.

01:14.820 --> 01:15.840
Let's take this input.

01:16.740 --> 01:17.670
We need this input.

01:20.290 --> 01:22.570
But this is interesting.

01:26.430 --> 01:28.710
It becomes eight or ten 008.

01:28.710 --> 01:32.550
So we are I'm just taking the input in this matrix whose power give you want.

01:33.090 --> 01:39.150
Now let's find out the power of this matrix, which will be simple for Vicky.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.130
So this is normal x1 intuition.

01:41.730 --> 01:44.580
If K and one that means.

01:46.370 --> 01:50.720
If it is our number, then what I do is okay, I need a result in metrics too.

01:51.140 --> 01:54.220
Let's take a metrics result and let's call it resulting.

01:54.530 --> 01:59.360
And we know that we have to make resilient as an identity metrics.

02:00.260 --> 02:02.770
So let's make it as identity metrics.

02:02.780 --> 02:04.340
I've already done a function for that.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.600
Well when?

02:07.260 --> 02:11.910
So if can one, then what we do is we simply multiply the metrics into residential.

02:11.910 --> 02:13.200
The return is equal to that.

02:13.200 --> 02:23.400
And in doing otherwise, what we do is we say A is equal to a into way pool and divide by two.

02:23.910 --> 02:25.080
This is normal, exponential.

02:25.950 --> 02:27.450
After all this we have.

02:27.450 --> 02:27.930
Fine.

02:28.260 --> 02:30.060
So by using this, we have found out.

02:31.190 --> 02:34.310
The power of this matrix e.

02:35.230 --> 02:35.980
But yeah.

02:35.980 --> 02:38.740
The power of this mattress and the distorting resulting.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.760
Will it be destroyed into the routine?

02:41.760 --> 02:42.150
Of course.

02:42.150 --> 02:45.000
I'm taking my cardio, so now it exceed my limit.

02:45.390 --> 02:46.380
Now what I need to do is.

02:49.510 --> 02:53.110
Just take the sum of all these values, you two answered.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.530
Classical studies are tendered m.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.160
I see.

02:59.620 --> 03:01.750
Okay, so, Eddie, it should be 18 or zero zero.

03:01.870 --> 03:02.290
My word.

03:04.070 --> 03:04.430
And.

03:05.520 --> 03:06.180
Answer.

03:06.780 --> 03:07.200
Smart.

03:07.650 --> 03:08.910
Smart is important to.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.130
Okay.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.960
I think I missed something.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.090
Okay.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.480
I missed printing on some.

03:22.810 --> 03:24.460
But what we are doing, we are getting six here.

03:24.820 --> 03:25.450
That's correct.

03:26.230 --> 03:28.690
Let's take four other things.

03:32.020 --> 03:33.400
This part is already being explained.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.740
The Matrix, but the Matrix four and intuition.

03:35.740 --> 03:37.450
But how is this calculation being done?

03:37.540 --> 03:40.690
How can we find out our key metrics?

03:40.690 --> 03:42.960
And now here we are using it basically eight.

03:43.760 --> 03:49.150
But it's your job to figure it out by rating a problem that which kind of problem it is whether it's

03:49.150 --> 03:55.450
a metric exponential B will it be using benchmarks to optimize automatic dictaphone ingestion or just

03:55.450 --> 04:01.420
a memo bed or just jury duty at a 3D at a 48 A and so on?

04:05.100 --> 04:11.370
This is the main part of taking programming at eight, figuring out that which BP will be used and what

04:11.370 --> 04:15.360
will be the relative relation and what we need to optimize it.

04:16.510 --> 04:17.600
In the given constraints.

04:18.180 --> 04:18.330
Okay.

04:18.520 --> 04:20.590
So let's copy this in submitted.

04:22.390 --> 04:23.530
I think they should work.

04:24.340 --> 04:27.250
Because I have taken Mahler 29 everywhere.

04:28.150 --> 04:31.120
Okay, let's take this input once it's big.

04:31.510 --> 04:33.010
I don't want to break this tree.

04:36.220 --> 04:36.520
Yeah.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.090
It's good to.

04:41.970 --> 04:42.090
Well.

04:42.150 --> 04:43.290
So what's the complexity here?

04:44.160 --> 04:45.900
This isn't going I think this is nothing.

04:45.900 --> 04:50.790
I think this is why we can always do a debate, also a log of this value.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.630
And in each of these, what we're doing is we're multiplying to mattresses.

04:54.990 --> 04:58.910
The log of gain and the multiplication of a metrics is sizing.

04:58.920 --> 05:03.240
Besides, in two sizes, which is Ice Cube, of course this can be reduced too, but we don't need that

05:03.570 --> 05:05.490
reduction metrics.

05:05.490 --> 05:10.650
Multiplication can also be done using stress in the algorithm, but we don't want that reduction right

05:10.650 --> 05:10.840
now.

05:10.860 --> 05:12.870
We don't want that kind of complexity.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.570
So Size Cube will work for us.

05:15.970 --> 05:19.740
This ice cube and do log of it will.

05:21.140 --> 05:21.290
Well.

05:21.350 --> 05:24.440
So we got a correct answer and it's really less execution.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.730
Bang, 15 milliseconds.

05:26.180 --> 05:27.980
It's yeah, this was 18.

05:28.490 --> 05:29.540
This was 37.

05:29.780 --> 05:31.220
And this is 58.

05:31.550 --> 05:35.420
Merrill's always closing in the next part and.

05:36.770 --> 05:37.790
I hope you understand.

05:37.820 --> 05:38.420
Understood.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.720
Well, metrics, multiplication metrics, exponential can be used.

05:42.810 --> 05:43.170
Thank you.
