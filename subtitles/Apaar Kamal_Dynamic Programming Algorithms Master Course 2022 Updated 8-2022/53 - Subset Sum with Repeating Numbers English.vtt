WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:00.690
Yep.

00:00.780 --> 00:03.370
So let's quickly see this a follow up problem.

00:03.720 --> 00:04.860
What if the values are repeating?

00:04.860 --> 00:09.560
That means it means now it won't be a problem.

00:09.570 --> 00:16.560
But we can see even a similarity of non-negative integers reminding us of zero very exist with some

00:16.560 --> 00:17.850
ecosystem services.

00:17.850 --> 00:24.360
What you can say is if I if I'm finding a particular subset of data, but to that those values could

00:24.360 --> 00:25.080
be repeated.

00:25.230 --> 00:28.020
That means this tool can be taken multiple number of times.

00:29.230 --> 00:33.350
Similarly, the seven can be taken multiple number of times, even zero eight.

00:33.550 --> 00:35.110
That means these values are now repeating.

00:35.110 --> 00:37.360
That means I have an finite supply of these values.

00:37.720 --> 00:43.570
I just have to tell whether it is possible to make a particular some or not.

00:44.930 --> 00:48.650
Some of you might be doing really approaches in this, but it won't always work.

00:49.550 --> 00:53.420
So for example, we saw that for destroying data.

00:53.570 --> 00:58.730
We got false statements on trendiness not possible with this particular rate.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.040
If I have to just pick one subset but not tell me if the numbers are repeating, that means I can pick

01:04.040 --> 01:06.920
to any number of them and this tornado should be possible.

01:08.120 --> 01:08.350
So.

01:09.780 --> 01:10.230
Simple.

01:10.650 --> 01:11.290
Let's see.

01:11.310 --> 01:12.630
Our state remains the same.

01:13.020 --> 01:14.730
Tell me if the.

01:15.810 --> 01:21.540
If I have the x eddie and dismissed it, it is possible or not to make some will do.

01:22.020 --> 01:22.200
But.

01:22.940 --> 01:25.710
But what options do the next?

01:26.600 --> 01:31.380
Eliminate have no last option is it will exclude.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.930
Let me read the exclusion list.

01:34.600 --> 01:38.280
So if it will exclude from the area, it will never come.

01:38.290 --> 01:39.490
That means it is simple.

01:40.000 --> 01:40.480
It's nothing.

01:40.480 --> 01:43.360
But tell me if something is possible.

01:44.560 --> 01:49.900
From the remaining x minus one element that Candace lets, it is included.

01:51.760 --> 01:55.110
But now there's a lot of gradient is included.

01:55.180 --> 02:01.600
That means this included can be one time, included can be two time included can be time included can

02:01.600 --> 02:03.560
be full time and zone eight.

02:04.060 --> 02:08.230
If this is if it is included, then it can be used for any number of times.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.460
Eight what this sees if it is included.

02:13.670 --> 02:14.090
And.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.790
If it is included once.

02:19.910 --> 02:22.070
Once made and deterred.

02:22.070 --> 02:23.870
I'll make it if it is included.

02:25.690 --> 02:26.560
Multiple number of.

02:27.390 --> 02:30.330
And we'll see what is the recursive approach that we are getting there.

02:30.750 --> 02:35.700
If it is included ones, then what begins in places like like the previous case that.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.500
Okay, I'm taking it once.

02:37.650 --> 02:41.010
Tell me if the sum of X by minus x is possible or not.

02:42.750 --> 02:43.860
And the third is.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.430
If I can include it again, that means I'm including multiple number of times eight.

02:50.700 --> 02:53.610
So here you might you all might be wondering that.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.800
Okay, let me go slow now.

02:56.910 --> 03:04.170
Let's see if I'm saying the if is included multiple number of times, eight, multiple number of time

03:04.620 --> 03:05.070
in that.

03:05.070 --> 03:06.480
Also, we can have many cases.

03:06.930 --> 03:08.790
That means it is in single two times.

03:08.790 --> 03:12.540
It is three times it is included four times or five times.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.840
And so until late many times.

03:15.410 --> 03:17.580
But in this case, what will be my records of relation?

03:17.580 --> 03:22.440
It will be nothing but tell me if x minus one is possible, if I'm including the current number two

03:22.440 --> 03:22.800
times.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.850
So what is the sum here?

03:24.330 --> 03:25.500
I'm here will return to.

03:26.530 --> 03:27.960
Oh, by minus two in two weeks.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.850
In this case, what will be the sum?

03:29.850 --> 03:32.310
It is x minus one comma by minus three.

03:32.310 --> 03:37.590
Index it because now I've enjoyed that number three times because it can come any number of.

03:39.570 --> 03:40.310
Oh, yeah.

03:40.410 --> 03:43.200
So if I want to generalize it, let's let me generalize it.

03:44.550 --> 03:52.890
If I want to generalize, it would be like get let's then a loop or I equals to one and I will go on

03:53.370 --> 03:56.300
for a like many times until the sum becomes zero.

03:56.610 --> 03:58.860
And I simply say it in me.

03:59.610 --> 04:00.450
Okay, let's.

04:02.010 --> 04:07.800
I'm just running this loop for like I goes from one to it's going forever.

04:07.800 --> 04:13.800
And what I simply say, I simply say, Tell me if you re meaning something that is x, y minus I do

04:13.800 --> 04:15.180
x is possible or not.

04:16.410 --> 04:17.520
So I went there and we did.

04:17.520 --> 04:19.470
Y minus x is same as once.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.210
Let's started from two.

04:22.790 --> 04:24.200
So just remember one thing.

04:24.620 --> 04:29.360
If I started from zero this loop, then it is just when I zero.

04:29.360 --> 04:34.490
This is when I is, it goes to one and these are for when I go straight to end and 38.

04:34.820 --> 04:37.100
But there's one thing that I don't want to do.

04:37.460 --> 04:42.790
Of course, we can see now that the complexity of the solution has increased because now we have a we

04:42.800 --> 04:44.280
are doing some work inside the.

04:44.320 --> 04:51.410
DICKERSON We are using it actually using a four lumen thing to make it run it.

04:51.410 --> 04:54.620
But there is another way of solving or another way of solving it.

04:54.620 --> 04:55.460
Let's see that.

04:56.150 --> 04:59.570
I hope this part is very clear of running a loop.

05:00.590 --> 05:04.910
Rachel we will not run a loop because we want to optimize it further.

05:05.450 --> 05:10.640
So what I'll do is I'll call it third hard problem.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.580
I'll just say, tell me whether.

05:15.150 --> 05:18.540
These some buying minus X.

05:19.790 --> 05:23.540
It's possible from the current index.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.570
Just think about it.

05:26.580 --> 05:27.640
Just think about this.

05:27.710 --> 05:29.810
Just pause the video for a minute and think about it.

05:29.820 --> 05:30.630
What does this mean?

05:31.830 --> 05:33.150
My area has not changed.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.740
But my submission that means I know also I'm on the same index.

05:39.040 --> 05:44.230
So if from x come over I call this, then it means that I'm on the same index.

05:45.180 --> 05:49.230
X, but now a new sum is five minus X.

05:50.180 --> 05:50.390
Eight.

05:50.690 --> 05:51.200
That means.

05:52.980 --> 05:56.100
I can again use the same state aid.

05:56.110 --> 05:59.070
So in this also what will happen again?

05:59.070 --> 06:03.450
It will return to three states as this above nation we have done it.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.370
So now the new state is me.

06:05.370 --> 06:12.490
Environment is saying this will be a F of if I if I do this, it will be f of x minus one comma y minus

06:12.530 --> 06:12.900
x.

06:13.960 --> 06:18.400
So I hope you're realizing this that instead of directly moving to x minus one.

06:19.980 --> 06:20.610
By A-minus.

06:20.610 --> 06:21.300
I can do it.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.230
I'm just saying.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.270
Tell me whether that sum is possible.

06:26.280 --> 06:31.080
If the ads seem I've not seen the idea, but I've used that number, it means I can use the number any

06:31.080 --> 06:32.550
number of times eight.

06:32.730 --> 06:33.750
Similarly, what will happen?

06:33.750 --> 06:36.000
This will again call the second part.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.960
This part it is x minus one by minus three x minus x, right?

06:43.200 --> 06:44.760
Because Y minus x was the sum.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.980
And I'm also predicting minus the x here.

06:47.590 --> 06:51.060
Well so this is nothing but y minus doing the x eight.

06:51.300 --> 06:51.570
So.

06:52.520 --> 06:55.520
I am leading this cleverly.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.210
By formulating this hard.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.240
Our dependency.

07:02.240 --> 07:07.070
What we can do is we can actually remove dependency of the 48 because.

07:08.800 --> 07:13.480
What we were doing is we were doing Y minus x, y minus two X by minus three eggs moment.

07:14.510 --> 07:15.640
So just think about this.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.170
Here it is.

07:17.770 --> 07:18.270
Here it is.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.240
If it's going away.

07:20.320 --> 07:24.130
This will call F of X chromosome Y minus x.

07:25.820 --> 07:34.000
Eight, which will eventually call this method incited hate, which is f of x comma, y minus four,

07:34.250 --> 07:37.790
which is F of x minus one gunman y minus x.

07:38.570 --> 07:47.990
Now this method will also call F of x, comma, y minus during the Higgs rect because in its sub problem

07:47.990 --> 07:51.260
also the third cell problem will be c eight which is.

07:52.250 --> 07:52.430
Why?

07:52.430 --> 07:53.030
Minus X?

07:53.030 --> 07:53.960
Minus X?

07:54.320 --> 07:56.900
Because right now I'm on the X element only.

07:57.290 --> 08:05.420
And this is recursion will also call F of X minus one comma y minus two x, because this is the first

08:05.420 --> 08:05.900
problem.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.210
I mean, this part of D.

08:10.400 --> 08:14.570
This problem made the first sub problem of this problem is.

08:16.010 --> 08:20.600
This F of x minus one comma, y minus two x eight.

08:20.600 --> 08:27.920
So I'm taking time here, but I want you to understand this and this will be used later as well.

08:28.100 --> 08:30.050
And it helps a lot in optimizing.

08:31.350 --> 08:36.930
It is by minus three X because the environment is two weeks will also go by minus three x.

08:38.300 --> 08:42.890
I called my ministry because that was the start of problems for this particular problem.

08:43.970 --> 08:50.300
And again, my ministry expert also called because the first problem of my ministry will be X minus

08:50.300 --> 08:51.320
one, comma, y minus.

08:54.310 --> 08:54.550
Well.

08:55.550 --> 08:59.530
So I hope you are saying of course I am not adding all the recursion.

08:59.570 --> 08:59.900
Right.

09:00.380 --> 09:02.360
This one thing which is still left.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.850
I'm not writing it, but.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.590
I hope you realize this.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.690
Now, tell me one thing.

09:11.880 --> 09:12.510
Is.

09:13.810 --> 09:14.290
This.

09:15.130 --> 09:16.030
The thing about this.

09:17.590 --> 09:19.570
Is this a problem required anymore?

09:21.280 --> 09:23.200
Question mark, is it required?

09:24.700 --> 09:26.650
And these two solve problems.

09:27.660 --> 09:33.750
Include the third problem here, which is by x0f of x minus one common a minus x.

09:34.920 --> 09:35.970
Yes, they can.

09:36.270 --> 09:37.340
How the.

09:38.560 --> 09:39.660
Very, very simple.

09:39.660 --> 09:39.940
Right?

09:42.020 --> 09:42.570
Let's see.

09:42.590 --> 09:43.970
I'm not calling it.

09:45.160 --> 09:45.430
Eight.

09:45.610 --> 09:46.630
So what does f of x?

09:46.630 --> 09:54.100
Where do f of x y equals f of x comma y minus x is basically this which eventually calls F of x minus

09:54.310 --> 09:56.710
one, comma, y minus x, which is this function.

09:57.190 --> 09:59.950
And, you know, we added ending all of all these states.

10:00.730 --> 10:03.730
So if any one of these states is true, I have to return true.

10:04.390 --> 10:07.210
Therefore, I don't want.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.240
Now, I don't want to use this particular call.

10:10.300 --> 10:10.600
Right.

10:11.020 --> 10:17.110
So you all must know that we always say about we always talk about optimal substructure.

10:17.380 --> 10:20.540
So here is an example of optimal eight.

10:20.950 --> 10:22.720
There are two substructures that we have.

10:23.840 --> 10:30.650
Other use history which is excluding loved ones or include multiple number of times or.

10:32.270 --> 10:38.960
Let's remove this substructure of include ones and because that is eventually handling include multiple

10:38.960 --> 10:39.740
number of things.

10:41.090 --> 10:42.690
I hope it's clear it.

10:44.660 --> 10:50.510
How is it eventually handling England multiple number of times this week, including a number of times.

10:50.810 --> 10:56.690
Now don't include so it is include ones will include multiple of number of times.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.980
Don't include today's include two times in the number of times.

11:01.010 --> 11:01.670
Don't include.

11:01.790 --> 11:03.020
It is include.

11:04.620 --> 11:05.370
Three times, so on.

11:06.190 --> 11:07.610
So I don't want to for a loop.

11:07.610 --> 11:09.710
I don't want to include once.

11:10.850 --> 11:15.650
This is my rebuilding of structure and optimal sap.

11:16.250 --> 11:16.640
Sorry.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.270
Repeating.

11:18.830 --> 11:21.010
The problems and optimal substructure.

11:21.020 --> 11:24.390
This is optimal because now it has only two balls.

11:24.440 --> 11:28.280
It is not having some redundant extra up.

11:29.360 --> 11:39.530
But also I hope you'll realize a few more things about to GDP by this particular example, because this

11:39.530 --> 11:45.290
is very important to not only interview provision you're stepping into, but of course that you will

11:45.290 --> 11:46.850
be realizing something.

11:48.220 --> 11:48.640
And.

11:51.130 --> 11:52.210
In the next five days.

11:53.080 --> 11:53.770
It's called this.
