00:00.610 --> 00:00.940
Okay.

00:00.940 --> 00:04.570
So let's see some variations of the take over games as discussed.

00:05.460 --> 00:05.730
Eight.

00:05.730 --> 00:08.640
Under normal rule, we are playing we are doing it for any good.

00:08.780 --> 00:09.930
20 and.

00:10.940 --> 00:12.020
We have a particular set.

00:12.200 --> 00:12.460
Eight.

00:12.470 --> 00:13.060
So what is this?

00:13.670 --> 00:14.810
Is this a correction set?

00:15.500 --> 00:20.370
But as I said, we are going to present Dick Williams as this a big game and two subtraction games as

00:20.370 --> 00:21.260
the TV games.

00:21.290 --> 00:22.430
It's not a big deal.

00:22.850 --> 00:24.380
We are taking away stones from that.

00:24.380 --> 00:25.730
That means we are doing something.

00:25.730 --> 00:29.690
We are subtracting something from a position and going onto some of the 58.

00:30.290 --> 00:33.410
I know let's say we have this subtraction set of one, two, three, four, five.

00:33.920 --> 00:39.770
Let's quickly build winning and losing positions and then we can easily find out if it is any good.

00:39.770 --> 00:47.390
Should 20 and it is elections she win or lose directly no win eight we okay.

00:47.390 --> 00:49.880
So quickly let's quickly do it and.

00:52.380 --> 00:52.980
So zero.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.000
It's a normal one.

00:54.210 --> 00:57.000
So zero will we're losing position again.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.730
Winning position, winning position winning position winning.

00:59.730 --> 01:06.840
Bush And then winning please by because from all these positions we can go to zero, which is a losing

01:06.840 --> 01:07.200
position.

01:08.060 --> 01:08.420
Now.

01:09.860 --> 01:11.000
Let's talk about six.

01:12.380 --> 01:19.330
So in six we can go from from six we can go to one, two, three, four, five, three, four or five,

01:19.450 --> 01:19.640
eight.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.630
All of them are winning positions.

01:21.650 --> 01:27.080
So as we know, if all of them are winning versions and this has to be a losing position, so we will

01:27.090 --> 01:33.530
be just one at least one losing positions to make it winning again, seven, eight, nine, ten and

01:33.530 --> 01:33.950
11.

01:33.950 --> 01:39.980
All our winning operations, because I can directly go to six, which is the losing position, and 12

01:39.980 --> 01:43.190
will be a losing position, winning positions.

01:44.630 --> 01:51.350
217 and then again, a losing, winning beating right over it is Ellis John's and she's on 20 the normal

01:51.350 --> 01:52.670
play rule she will win.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.840
Right because she'll give it to Bob and then so on.

01:58.060 --> 01:59.770
There shouldn't be any doubt in this case.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.030
A very easy thing, though.

02:01.730 --> 02:06.910
Well, so what is the condition that we earn over here?

02:07.180 --> 02:10.830
It is if not six equals two zero, then it's a.

02:12.810 --> 02:13.570
Losing position.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.450
A divided to with.

02:18.410 --> 02:18.680
Will.

02:19.800 --> 02:20.100
Great.

02:20.580 --> 02:23.220
Now, let's talk about setting an example in this.

02:23.220 --> 02:24.510
I haven't considered one.

02:24.510 --> 02:27.750
I'm just taking a very small set to in for eight.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.630
So we know zero is a losing position because we cannot make a move.

02:31.290 --> 02:32.430
It's a dominant position.

02:32.910 --> 02:34.390
So one on one.

02:34.410 --> 02:35.820
Also, I cannot make a move.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.980
Right, because I cannot pick up two students.

02:38.310 --> 02:39.600
I cannot pick up four students.

02:40.080 --> 02:40.920
This has to be a.

02:42.100 --> 02:48.340
Losing position was I cannot make a move, although there are restaurant slip, but I cannot make it.

02:48.340 --> 02:49.540
So it's a dominant position.

02:49.540 --> 02:50.620
It's a losing position.

02:51.250 --> 02:53.650
Now, two from two I can go to zero.

02:53.870 --> 02:56.860
So the reason losing operations or two has to be a winning position.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.180
From three.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.920
I can go to one again.

02:59.940 --> 03:02.130
Winning position from four.

03:02.220 --> 03:04.680
I can go to two and zero.

03:05.250 --> 03:08.580
The two was a winning position and zero was a losing position.

03:08.940 --> 03:09.270
Eight.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.310
So of course I go to a losing position.

03:11.730 --> 03:15.300
That means there is at least one losing position in the vicinity.

03:15.820 --> 03:16.520
It has to be.

03:18.050 --> 03:18.830
Winning Buddhism.

03:18.920 --> 03:19.280
Right.

03:19.370 --> 03:20.360
Let's talk about faith.

03:20.870 --> 03:23.090
From five, I can go to three, I can go to one.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.900
So again, winning Bush and you do one is a losing position.

03:27.590 --> 03:30.170
From six, I can go to four and two.

03:30.620 --> 03:34.970
Now we have got a losing position because both two and four are winning positions.

03:35.840 --> 03:40.940
One is, again, a losing position because we can go from 7 to 5 or three I.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.770
So here is this petting zoo you can see.

03:46.990 --> 03:47.710
Or abuse.

03:49.310 --> 03:49.650
Late.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.600
And who?

03:54.220 --> 03:56.570
The winning, winning, winning and losing.

03:57.200 --> 04:01.730
And soon to them always will be a pattern in some set of moves.

04:02.180 --> 04:02.990
So what?

04:03.380 --> 04:04.490
What happens in the equation?

04:04.730 --> 04:09.440
You don't have to find or code all of this set out.

04:09.470 --> 04:10.790
You don't have to do it for all.

04:10.790 --> 04:12.320
And as I'm doing for 20.

04:12.560 --> 04:16.670
What you do is you write this in your copy pen, paper and.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.330
Do this.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.060
Make this table in pen and paper and.

04:23.010 --> 04:23.790
Derive the pattern.

04:24.450 --> 04:28.170
After you have got the burden, you have derived the burden, you absorb the burden.

04:28.890 --> 04:33.960
You just simply say, if end is this, then else if and is that Bob?

04:34.350 --> 04:35.550
What is the condition in this?

04:36.540 --> 04:39.660
As we can see, these are, say, calibrating on every six terms.

04:41.730 --> 04:42.030
Eight.

04:42.690 --> 04:48.420
If an mod six equals to zero or one, then it's a losing position.

04:48.420 --> 04:49.740
Otherwise it's a winning push.

04:50.820 --> 04:54.810
So if I say Tell me about an English 250, what I'll do, I'll say 56.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.380
This will be homage to Louisa.

05:01.980 --> 05:03.650
There are two ways of winning position.

05:03.650 --> 05:06.800
As we can see, a left with a winning position.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.810
That means 51 the winning position.

05:08.870 --> 05:12.260
So it is elections and it is 50 even 50.

05:12.260 --> 05:13.820
She will win no matter what.

05:14.570 --> 05:14.900
Eight.

05:15.880 --> 05:16.240
Great.

05:16.420 --> 05:22.900
So you can drive your own examples, play with you, play the same game with your friends and bet.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.500
But now you know how to actually solve this game.

05:27.040 --> 05:27.370
Eight.

05:28.150 --> 05:28.400
Oh.

05:28.540 --> 05:28.910
Okay.

05:29.140 --> 05:30.040
In the next five days.
