WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:06.380
Well, everyone, let's go to this and we will get it bottom up now.

00:06.390 --> 00:06.750
Right.

00:07.020 --> 00:11.640
So let's take a dip here and let's call it an and one.

00:11.910 --> 00:12.750
Let's shift and.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.000
Right.

00:14.430 --> 00:14.760
So.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.430
Okay, so right now we have an away.

00:17.580 --> 00:24.270
So why don't I just, you know, take a vector and graph and in this case.

00:24.270 --> 00:27.570
Right, so let's remove these global variables.

00:28.780 --> 00:30.610
And in this I'm just pushing X and Y.

00:30.610 --> 00:31.150
That works.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.760
Let's take small innovate put.

00:34.420 --> 00:41.500
So generally what will happen when you see the problems related to the mosque?

00:41.500 --> 00:45.460
You will see an approximately being equal to 15 or 16.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.240
That means and will be very little because the complex it is to restore the power.

00:49.240 --> 00:55.690
And in doing it because we need to fit this complexity like less than equal to tended to the power seven

00:55.690 --> 00:55.990
right.

00:56.260 --> 01:05.320
So that's it if you see a very small and just assume that 60% like just take it as a hint that the problem

01:05.320 --> 01:08.950
will require different musk eight and cool.

01:09.100 --> 01:13.720
So this is deep and initially let me set everything to zero.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.760
Right, because.

01:15.760 --> 01:15.970
Yeah.

01:18.040 --> 01:23.260
Size of the B eight and what are the base cases with the base cases?

01:23.500 --> 01:24.550
So from every node.

01:24.850 --> 01:27.070
If I start, I am visiting that note.

01:27.070 --> 01:27.240
Right?

01:27.280 --> 01:29.620
That means every note is positive from that node.

01:29.890 --> 01:38.560
So let me simply iterate from zero to and I simply say that DPI and one left shift is is one is true

01:38.560 --> 01:39.070
basically.

01:39.610 --> 01:43.300
What does this mean that if I'm starting from my.

01:44.970 --> 01:51.510
Or if I'm currently on a that means I'm ending on I and they said it is one lecture but I'll get that

01:51.990 --> 01:58.510
we have only one area in this and then when it's true, that means I'm able to visit right now for fraud.

01:58.530 --> 02:00.170
For every note nobody loses.

02:00.180 --> 02:01.230
Try to move forward.

02:01.660 --> 02:09.210
We will try to go to G if that G if they're g wasn't I just NC list of the I it's not and the G was

02:09.510 --> 02:12.680
not visited then I can visit it and market rate.

02:12.810 --> 02:14.010
So let me just updated.

02:16.560 --> 02:16.980
Yep.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.030
So.

02:23.320 --> 02:23.600
Right.

02:24.060 --> 02:27.370
And okay, so what's better?

02:27.370 --> 02:31.600
Let's just start from my equals to zero and.

02:32.680 --> 02:32.960
No.

02:33.730 --> 02:34.150
Sorry.

02:34.870 --> 02:37.540
So what I'll do is I'll start from.

02:37.750 --> 02:38.140
Okay.

02:38.470 --> 02:39.360
Let's say a mosque.

02:39.370 --> 02:42.760
Let's call it mosque instead of I to make things more clear.

02:43.510 --> 02:50.390
And this mosque will start from maybe zero and go to one unresponsive over and eight and minus eight.

02:50.620 --> 02:54.130
And what I'll do is I'll just try to make this mosque.

02:54.310 --> 02:54.580
Right.

02:54.790 --> 02:57.140
And also, there's one more thing that we need to do.

02:57.170 --> 02:57.430
Okay.

02:57.460 --> 02:58.510
We'll come to that later.

02:58.990 --> 03:05.110
Now we know that let's have a mosque 1001108.

03:05.530 --> 03:09.380
So let's add this is the straight and zero one, two, three, four.

03:09.400 --> 03:09.700
Right.

03:09.700 --> 03:10.600
And let's say four.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.310
And this mosque was two.

03:12.310 --> 03:19.090
What what it means that I visited these nodes, which are two, three, one, two and four.

03:19.870 --> 03:21.940
So I was able to visit one twin forward.

03:22.180 --> 03:24.700
That means there was a path which ended on four.

03:25.060 --> 03:28.090
Now, from four, I want to try out different possibilities.

03:29.110 --> 03:34.000
That means I want to try out whether I can go to three or not, whether I can go to zero or not eight.

03:34.310 --> 03:34.660
So.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.790
So if I see, let's say if this was possible, then only will try for the right.

03:40.090 --> 03:41.050
So yeah.

03:41.710 --> 03:49.420
So let me just iterate over the I nodes or let's call it current eight that right now I'm on the current

03:49.510 --> 03:49.660
node.

03:50.290 --> 03:54.280
And what I will say is for mosque and for this current node if.

03:55.810 --> 03:56.770
It was possible.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.010
There is deep current and musk read.

04:00.190 --> 04:06.070
If this was possible then only I'll just try to make some other possibilities and update them.

04:06.790 --> 04:07.900
That means if.

04:08.170 --> 04:14.800
Okay, let's take this example only if this 10110 and I'll just try to make a possibility of going to

04:14.800 --> 04:15.150
zero.

04:15.160 --> 04:18.880
That means from this date, 410110.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.350
Can I go to this date?

04:20.350 --> 04:23.380
Which is 010111?

04:23.620 --> 04:25.360
That means now I'm including zero.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.500
That means I'm one zero.

04:26.500 --> 04:32.680
And whether I was able to go to zero, that means was there Hamiltonian but right.

04:32.950 --> 04:34.420
So yeah.

04:34.750 --> 04:38.350
So this, this will be only possible if this was possible.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.280
Correct.

04:39.280 --> 04:45.610
Or for this there can be other possibilities that are if I'm visiting zero, they can be other possibilities.

04:45.610 --> 04:45.910
Right.

04:46.090 --> 04:53.740
For example, let's see even of zero, one, two, let's if two and this same mask, which is 10110

04:53.740 --> 04:57.010
was possible, what it means that there was a part starting somewhere.

04:57.010 --> 05:01.240
We don't know where it started then even we don't have to count it right where it started.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.380
We don't need it basically.

05:02.740 --> 05:10.870
So if 210110 was possible, that means end to end zero are actually existing to each other.

05:11.020 --> 05:18.790
Then also this can be possible correct that I can go on this date zero and I can means move on to zero

05:18.790 --> 05:25.360
and this includes zero into my musk eight and this this 4 to 0 transition can also be possible if there

05:25.360 --> 05:30.220
was a connection between four and zero like four in zero eight.

05:30.220 --> 05:37.360
I hope this is I hope this is very understandable and it's very easy for any of the current state and

05:37.360 --> 05:37.930
the mask.

05:37.930 --> 05:41.650
I want to update the further states which are not state in this state.

05:41.830 --> 05:48.820
So for that I have to run a loop and let's see, let's call it X, right?

05:48.820 --> 05:54.370
That is what is x x x are the number of the vertex exit, the number of the words on which I want to

05:54.370 --> 05:56.200
go to from the current state.

05:56.620 --> 05:59.020
Okay, so let's run.

05:59.260 --> 06:04.990
What I can do is I can also, you know, do this for auto x in graph of current.

06:04.990 --> 06:10.630
This is also good in this just I don't have to check whether it is just in the list of current or not

06:10.630 --> 06:11.740
because it is already there.

06:12.010 --> 06:19.450
And what I want, what I simply do is I simply check if this s this x should not be set in.

06:19.450 --> 06:20.410
Musk First of all.

06:20.650 --> 06:24.100
State So if not X, right shift.

06:25.390 --> 06:25.670
Okay.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.510
Musk Right shift X and one.

06:29.440 --> 06:29.680
Ready.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.570
Let me give one more bracket to it.

06:32.020 --> 06:36.850
So if this is not true, that means it was not set in the mask plus eight.

06:37.180 --> 06:42.040
The second thing is we know that X and carrying that addition to each other, right.

06:42.040 --> 06:46.960
So we don't want do we don't have to check that and we have already checked whether X was in this way.

06:47.260 --> 06:56.920
So we're simply saying I simply say that deep X and musk, the mask or one left shift X times because

06:56.920 --> 07:00.250
we have included X into my mask is to.

07:01.820 --> 07:02.640
Why is this true?

07:02.660 --> 07:04.130
Because this was true.

07:04.130 --> 07:07.940
And they are in the a list of the current symbol.

07:08.570 --> 07:10.490
And what will be my final answer?

07:10.730 --> 07:12.410
So let's take billion.

07:12.410 --> 07:15.800
And so that means whether our Hamiltonian party existed or not.

07:16.210 --> 07:17.060
It's very simple.

07:17.780 --> 07:24.110
It just means one thing that if I'm on something, I can end on any of the notes.

07:24.110 --> 07:24.410
Right?

07:24.440 --> 07:29.510
So if I'm ending on and, you know, Trump zero to win and the mask and then all the nodes.

07:29.930 --> 07:30.260
Right.

07:30.470 --> 07:35.120
So if the mask and then all the notes and I'm only one of the nodes and it is true that means there

07:35.120 --> 07:41.150
was a but I say answer or equals to DP.

07:42.330 --> 07:48.330
Any of the notes, which is I and the the mask in this case will be one left shift and minus one.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.460
They let me give a pretty good deal.

07:52.240 --> 07:52.510
Why?

07:52.530 --> 07:58.720
Well, if you did minus one, because all all these streets were visited and I ended on I and if it

07:58.720 --> 08:03.190
was true, if any one of them was true, then that means the answer will be to let me be let.

08:04.520 --> 08:04.990
Okay.

08:05.000 --> 08:05.690
So I made it.

08:06.590 --> 08:06.920
Okay.

08:07.670 --> 08:08.990
And then comma and.

08:11.510 --> 08:13.220
So here you can see again, I've got one.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.140
So this is a very basic debate.

08:15.140 --> 08:19.640
But my solution and this I hope the transitions are very clear.

08:19.910 --> 08:24.200
We we want to build some future mosque by using the current mosque.

08:24.200 --> 08:29.780
And I already said the basic is that for the current law and that, as I said, it's always true.

08:30.380 --> 08:36.290
And then what we're doing is for every current and for a particular mosque, I'm just taking.

08:37.380 --> 08:41.070
Whether Deep Current in was true or not, it was true.

08:41.100 --> 08:41.940
What does it mean?

08:42.270 --> 08:45.340
That it simply means one thing that.

08:46.920 --> 08:52.020
There was a Hamiltonian path which ended on the current node by using these many nodes which are certain

08:52.020 --> 08:53.760
musk which are in musk, right?

08:53.790 --> 08:59.820
And then I'll go in there, presents a list of the current node and I just see whether that the node

08:59.820 --> 09:01.980
on which I want to go to is not in the math.

09:02.550 --> 09:09.600
That means there can be a possibility that if I ask if I know an X and I just started in the musk and

09:09.600 --> 09:16.710
make it linked to it is a very it is very tricky to explain but I hope we are in history and it's not

09:16.710 --> 09:17.490
a big deal though.

09:17.940 --> 09:18.860
And yeah.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.310
So in the next part, everyone.
