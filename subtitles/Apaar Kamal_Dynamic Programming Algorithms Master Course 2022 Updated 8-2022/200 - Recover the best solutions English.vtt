00:00.540 --> 00:01.200
And everyone.

00:01.210 --> 00:02.970
So will the streets back.

00:03.210 --> 00:04.740
You don't bring solutions so far.

00:04.740 --> 00:07.590
And I just taken this example of absurd.

00:07.590 --> 00:08.220
Some problem.

00:09.810 --> 00:16.740
So let me quickly open the court, and most of you by now must already realize how to trace back these.

00:18.090 --> 00:20.700
But let me also you don't give it a shot.

00:21.730 --> 00:27.010
So what we are doing is nothing, but we we're just calling subsection of this and it is giving me one.

00:27.540 --> 00:31.530
But let's I also want to bring to the subset some that I'm getting.

00:31.530 --> 00:31.870
Right.

00:31.890 --> 00:32.580
What I'll do is.

00:33.510 --> 00:37.110
Its right of function and let's call it print subset.

00:37.980 --> 00:38.300
Some.

00:38.880 --> 00:43.860
And this function will be void for me because I'm printing the function.

00:45.130 --> 00:46.450
And I paused.

00:46.510 --> 00:46.750
Just.

00:46.750 --> 00:47.650
Just remember this.

00:47.650 --> 00:53.140
This past, this same stage of dysfunction should be same as states of dysfunction.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.780
So let me just posit.

00:57.670 --> 00:59.470
Brings up the atom and Madison chromosome.

01:00.010 --> 01:04.840
Let me just quickly write it brings up such an index.

01:06.350 --> 01:07.260
Index command.

01:07.910 --> 01:09.740
But you'll realize that.

01:12.110 --> 01:14.870
This is the same problem as this.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.190
What I'll do is nothing.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.110
The base case is simple.

01:20.770 --> 01:22.960
Let me update this base case.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.310
It is a vindictive return.

01:25.890 --> 01:27.910
Not now, because now we know it's a void.

01:27.910 --> 01:28.310
Functions.

01:28.340 --> 01:29.380
It's written back.

01:30.840 --> 01:38.670
And the second thing is, yeah, it should be it is exactly the same function that the above recursive

01:38.670 --> 01:40.410
function, all of it will be same.

01:40.620 --> 01:46.170
We don't need memory additions, memorize it and we just need two things that added this.

01:46.260 --> 01:48.600
It was possible or this was possible.

01:49.170 --> 01:51.480
So what I'll do is I'll simply say that if.

01:52.930 --> 01:55.210
Yes, that is absurd.

01:55.240 --> 01:59.320
Some of the let me pick up district.

02:01.000 --> 02:01.560
It's absurd.

02:01.570 --> 02:02.920
Some of this was true.

02:04.280 --> 02:04.510
Eight.

02:05.030 --> 02:11.930
We all know that it will only bring this absurd sum, but it will only bring it if it's true, right?

02:12.650 --> 02:15.860
If it's true, then we have only two options from where it is coming.

02:16.340 --> 02:18.650
Is was this true or was this true?

02:19.070 --> 02:19.370
Eight.

02:19.790 --> 02:21.080
If this was true.

02:22.180 --> 02:23.110
And it's very simple.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.720
If this was true, then it's very simple.

02:26.740 --> 02:28.120
I simply ask it.

02:28.120 --> 02:29.190
I'll simply ask it.

02:31.650 --> 02:37.710
Tracking solution of tracing solution to simply print a of index.

02:38.460 --> 02:44.250
Because this was used in my support state, I simply print it and I'll call print subset.

02:45.370 --> 02:52.690
Now Gorn brings up some from index minus one to some minus eight of index.

02:54.270 --> 02:54.590
This.

02:55.930 --> 02:57.670
But if this was true, that means.

02:59.910 --> 03:01.530
I have to go in this spot.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.620
And what if this was not true?

03:05.010 --> 03:06.690
That means else if.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.420
The second of it was true.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.270
That means this particular state.

03:12.590 --> 03:13.820
So if this was true.

03:13.850 --> 03:14.690
Now we know that.

03:15.380 --> 03:16.760
Sorry, this.

03:20.490 --> 03:21.660
This is Sub6.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.620
If this thread was true, that means the answer is coming from this state.

03:25.950 --> 03:29.430
If it did not come from here, then it must have come from it.

03:29.820 --> 03:32.520
And if it did not come from both of them, then it will simply return.

03:32.790 --> 03:33.840
It will not print anything.

03:34.530 --> 03:36.870
So if it is coming from index meaning, then chromosomes.

03:36.890 --> 03:38.280
What does this mean?

03:38.440 --> 03:40.470
The state means that I'm not including that element.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.180
You all know that.

03:41.730 --> 03:46.410
If I'm not including that element, what I'll simply do is I will simply not print the element.

03:46.410 --> 03:50.040
And I just simply ask it to print the absurd sum.

03:50.940 --> 03:55.230
I'm index minus one chromosome because if I'm not included, it doesn't mean that I've not included

03:55.230 --> 03:56.130
previous indexes.

03:56.550 --> 04:01.620
I have to trace it back and I'll simply return when the index is minus one invalid.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.710
So I hear what we have got.

04:07.210 --> 04:14.230
This one represents the that it's true that this subject is possible and what moral values have disappeared.

04:14.230 --> 04:14.860
Some are just five.

04:14.860 --> 04:19.060
And so instead of slash, let's give.

04:23.460 --> 04:24.390
Eight, five and seven.

04:24.750 --> 04:25.380
It's Eve.

04:25.620 --> 04:26.730
How is 11 made?

04:30.310 --> 04:33.910
It is 1415428.

04:33.910 --> 04:37.630
So this is a part of a subset which is giving me I hope this is very clear.

04:40.390 --> 04:40.840
But easy.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.360
You can apply this to any other dining room.

04:44.730 --> 04:45.320
But it is.

04:45.330 --> 04:47.190
You have to just chase back that one.

04:47.190 --> 04:49.860
But he goes, he said, I'm not going the path.

04:50.220 --> 04:53.700
I'm either going in this spot or I'm going in this spot.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.530
You have to exactly in one part.

04:55.770 --> 04:58.860
Otherwise, you will bring multiple solutions that will not be there.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.370
They added This should be to others.

05:02.370 --> 05:05.720
Should we bother them to bring anyone government?

05:06.790 --> 05:08.730
So you just have to go to one.

05:08.730 --> 05:11.670
But just remembered it in this this prince upset.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.620
Some will call one prince upset.

05:13.830 --> 05:15.300
It's really called one prince upset.

05:15.710 --> 05:16.200
But wanted.

05:17.090 --> 05:18.500
And after the basic is what will happen.

05:18.500 --> 05:22.130
It will simply keep underlining not going any of that.

05:22.140 --> 05:26.050
But if once the basis is reached, it will destroy it underdone.

05:29.520 --> 05:29.780
Well.

05:30.360 --> 05:30.960
So, yeah.

05:31.170 --> 05:31.890
In the next part.
