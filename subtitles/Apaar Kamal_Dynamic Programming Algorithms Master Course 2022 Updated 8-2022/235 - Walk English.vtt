WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:01.520
And everyone.

00:01.700 --> 00:03.170
Welcome to the new problem.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.060
And this is one of my favorites problem.

00:06.400 --> 00:10.180
So this problem will relate back to.

00:11.590 --> 00:13.810
A topic that we've already started in this course.

00:14.390 --> 00:18.220
And here we have the problem statement that let me.

00:19.220 --> 00:26.570
The problem statement that is a symbol corrected gravity within vertices number one to MN but each i.e.

00:26.570 --> 00:33.310
and you are going in and be degraded there to present whether they detected as from vertex I do it if

00:33.430 --> 00:39.980
it is one they either edge from vertex I do g if AJ zero there is not.

00:40.160 --> 00:45.890
But basically we have been given a matrix which tells us that whether I committed these are directed

00:45.890 --> 00:47.300
edge to it or not.

00:47.840 --> 00:55.130
Pull the find a number of different parts of lint key in g modular ten to the nameless seven.

00:55.990 --> 00:56.320
Okay.

00:56.320 --> 01:01.870
So what we have to do is we have to find a number of different detected parts of Flint.

01:02.070 --> 01:02.420
Okay.

01:02.920 --> 01:03.190
Okay.

01:03.190 --> 01:04.600
So we have to find the parts of Flint.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.110
Exactly.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.910
Key in the graph.

01:07.970 --> 01:11.200
And number seven is we want to answer it.

01:11.230 --> 01:11.680
It's fine.

01:12.310 --> 01:13.830
We will also count above two.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.860
The travel is the same as multiple times.

01:15.880 --> 01:16.210
Okay.

01:16.690 --> 01:21.490
We can go through a but multiple number of times.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.080
We can go through.

01:24.930 --> 01:27.240
Same edge multiple times later.

01:27.660 --> 01:32.640
So let me show you that we did a problem, I guess longest part was it.

01:33.300 --> 01:33.660
Yeah.

01:33.930 --> 01:38.730
So here we we know they took it does not contain this good cycle.

01:39.030 --> 01:44.170
That means here we found the longest spot in D where there was no cycle involved.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.110
But in this problem, what we have is.

01:47.820 --> 01:48.090
Yeah.

01:48.420 --> 01:54.690
So in this problem, what we have is invoke we can have a cycle as a path because we can traverse the

01:54.690 --> 01:55.770
image multiple times.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.020
So how do we do this?

02:00.480 --> 02:04.470
Okay, let's dig for some inputs and then we will worry about doing it.

02:05.220 --> 02:06.060
What I have is.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.500
Okay, let me make this graph.

02:18.260 --> 02:19.830
Also the graph is from one.

02:19.850 --> 02:21.170
It goes straight to.

02:23.530 --> 02:24.430
From two, it goes.

02:24.430 --> 02:26.470
Two, three, three, two, four.

02:27.410 --> 02:28.940
All the ones are here we can have.

02:29.870 --> 02:31.280
There is no issue with that.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.040
But I want to find out how many.

02:36.870 --> 02:39.360
I'd say they're offline too, right?

02:41.440 --> 02:41.770
Okay.

02:41.770 --> 02:46.120
So first of all, let's think about how many parts of the airplanes when they so how many parts of the

02:46.120 --> 02:46.860
Arab land won.

02:47.270 --> 02:52.900
So if I talk about all because you when we there okay tell me how many parts are there from you two

02:52.900 --> 02:53.780
way of land one.

02:54.310 --> 02:54.580
Right.

02:54.730 --> 02:58.330
So if we can see that there's only one part from under two of land.

02:58.330 --> 03:00.310
One from 2 to 4.

03:00.340 --> 03:03.520
One part 2 to 3 one but 3 to 4.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.230
One but and 4 to 1.

03:05.230 --> 03:06.610
One part eight.

03:06.610 --> 03:08.110
And is there.

03:08.410 --> 03:09.280
One, two, three, four, five.

03:09.280 --> 03:09.520
Yeah.

03:09.550 --> 03:10.440
No other partner each.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.140
So we have these five parts of land.

03:12.190 --> 03:13.030
One right now.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.530
I'm talking about land one.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.440
So how do I get so sleep?

03:19.530 --> 03:22.020
I want to just calculate how many parts are there of land.

03:22.020 --> 03:24.350
One for any given metrics.

03:25.590 --> 03:26.460
Then how do I do it?

03:26.730 --> 03:29.080
I just simply take the sum of all the ones.

03:29.080 --> 03:29.690
Zero, right.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.680
So all the ones represented electranet.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.390
That means I can just.

03:33.420 --> 03:33.840
I was there.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.530
Didn't I remember part of the.

03:36.380 --> 03:37.550
I hope this is very clear.

03:38.210 --> 03:39.860
I'm just talking about parts of gentleman.

03:39.860 --> 03:42.140
So here again, we'll have how many parts of Lent?

03:42.140 --> 03:42.410
One.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.760
The one to do is one.

03:44.210 --> 03:44.540
You do.

03:44.540 --> 03:46.160
One is one and two, two, three is one.

03:46.490 --> 03:47.890
The validity parts.

03:47.930 --> 03:49.370
Three edges, three parts of land.

03:49.370 --> 03:50.660
One would.

03:53.090 --> 03:58.760
So if I say that, okay, if I want to make a matrix of you cross V and which tells me that how many

03:58.760 --> 03:59.750
bodies are they from you?

04:00.050 --> 04:02.510
You do V of length one eight.

04:02.690 --> 04:07.310
Then this will be equal to the same matrix which is that dense at just in semantics which just given

04:07.310 --> 04:07.640
to me.

04:08.490 --> 04:10.200
In the input it.

04:11.870 --> 04:14.180
Well, you'll hear again.

04:14.180 --> 04:14.540
It will.

04:14.570 --> 04:15.900
We'll have the same thing, right.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.840
So we'll have only three parts in this way.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.260
The sum of the all the ones is the.

04:20.270 --> 04:21.230
We have three ones here.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.140
Now, let's talk about plots of land, too.

04:25.520 --> 04:31.370
So let's ignore plots of land one and let's talk about plots of land to divide.

04:31.430 --> 04:38.000
If I want to find out how many parts are there, what all you cross, we know that if I start from one

04:38.000 --> 04:45.740
and go to three, or if I if I start from three and go to one, how many parts of land do I will that

04:45.740 --> 04:47.060
dependent part of land?

04:47.060 --> 04:47.360
One.

04:48.560 --> 04:49.800
Let's figure this out.

04:50.610 --> 04:52.620
If I want to start from something, you.

04:52.620 --> 04:56.580
I want to go to somebody and I want an intermediate station here.

04:56.580 --> 04:56.830
Right.

04:56.850 --> 04:58.650
Let's call it x eight.

04:59.230 --> 04:59.970
What I can do.

04:59.970 --> 05:01.230
Is it okay?

05:01.770 --> 05:02.430
Tell me that.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.960
How many bots were there from you?

05:04.980 --> 05:06.840
Two x offline.

05:06.930 --> 05:07.230
One.

05:08.340 --> 05:09.510
Eight and.

05:10.700 --> 05:11.760
Is there a bathroom?

05:11.780 --> 05:13.550
A story of rent?

05:13.550 --> 05:14.990
One that means.

05:16.970 --> 05:19.700
If I want to go from you, do V in two steps.

05:19.700 --> 05:21.740
That means I want an intermediate station.

05:21.740 --> 05:27.530
That means if I can go from you to some other x ray that x can be.

05:27.530 --> 05:32.090
We do raid, let's say of he has an edge over itself.

05:32.510 --> 05:35.420
Then as from we do, we then also we will count v right.

05:36.080 --> 05:41.780
Well, what parts of line to what I can do is I can find out all the parts of length one from you to

05:41.780 --> 05:47.330
me, from you to x where x belongs to one to in all the numbers.

05:48.520 --> 05:56.080
And so I'm finding out that how many parts are there from starting from you of land one day legs eight

05:56.290 --> 06:02.320
which is being given to me by the enzymatic, which have already seen the matrix, which has already

06:02.320 --> 06:04.600
been given to me rate of length one.

06:05.380 --> 06:07.110
And now for that X.

06:07.120 --> 06:11.740
Now I'm trying to figure out whether is there a connection from X to we.

06:13.100 --> 06:16.400
That means whether there are directed pods from SUV.

06:16.730 --> 06:22.730
If yes, then what I'll do is I simply added in to my answer that yes for this particular text.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.980
They were led to five buds from your do we.

06:24.980 --> 06:27.380
Let's see, they were five buds from your two X.

06:28.410 --> 06:30.870
And from X to V, there are two parts.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.160
Right now I'm considering multiple ideas.

06:33.180 --> 06:34.200
I do not worry about that.

06:34.890 --> 06:35.370
How many?

06:35.920 --> 06:38.040
So how many total parts are there?

06:39.360 --> 06:40.750
They are firing to do images.

06:41.010 --> 06:47.880
And but because I can come from you do X in five different ways and from X to you I can go in two different

06:47.880 --> 06:48.150
ways.

06:48.510 --> 06:49.530
So I'll have how many?

06:49.530 --> 06:51.120
One party of one party at eight.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.100
In this way I can figure it out.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.830
And how many parts are there of land to write to?

06:55.920 --> 07:01.230
If I want to write a recursive relation in this case, for it to learn to do with them.

07:01.230 --> 07:03.390
What I do is I liquidated.

07:08.410 --> 07:08.640
So.

07:08.740 --> 07:13.080
So let's call W.K. to be equal to part of Lansky.

07:13.490 --> 07:15.490
So here what we have is for W.

07:15.760 --> 07:16.060
Okay.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.480
So W it goes to one is, it goes to summation for all ages.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.670
Hey, double submissions I got from one twin and it goes from one twin.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.070
And we have this summation that's not a big issue.

07:27.070 --> 07:27.970
We've already seen this.

07:28.660 --> 07:32.840
Now, what we have is parts of linked to a bottle length two.

07:32.890 --> 07:35.710
For every idea what we have is what we have seen.

07:36.550 --> 07:37.420
It is equal to.

07:38.540 --> 07:38.800
Right now.

07:38.810 --> 07:40.540
I'm talking about all the ideas, right?

07:40.940 --> 07:42.380
Well, it is equal to.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.940
Reports of landmines.

07:44.940 --> 07:46.070
So let's talk about some.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.410
You come over here, right.

07:47.490 --> 07:49.790
And then with some oil, you come to these aid.

07:49.830 --> 07:52.460
So it will be equal to the summation of all your movies.

07:52.970 --> 07:53.730
So here we have.

07:55.570 --> 07:55.840
Yeah.

07:55.840 --> 08:02.770
So he will have that it is he goes two pots of lentil one from some you go my ex so let's see.

08:04.460 --> 08:05.810
X from one to in.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.450
But we have from one to.

08:10.260 --> 08:11.240
X eight.

08:11.250 --> 08:14.040
So instead of dots, let's use commas.

08:18.860 --> 08:20.270
From you two eggs.

08:20.270 --> 08:26.990
I'm going off Lent one day and I want to find out what it is they're about from instruments which will

08:27.410 --> 08:30.590
which will be equal to the images that I've already been given.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.400
But it's going to be.

08:35.560 --> 08:36.330
What does this mean?

08:36.420 --> 08:37.620
Is that okay?

08:37.650 --> 08:39.240
Yes, there was a bathroom.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.680
You do read that there were these many.

08:40.680 --> 08:48.750
But that is given that are given dominion w one you for my ex and I'm simply multiplying it with e of

08:48.900 --> 08:53.430
column of environment, multiplying it with it because if it is equal to one, that means yes, there

08:53.430 --> 08:56.040
was a path through makes to v one.

08:56.250 --> 09:00.750
If it is equal to zero, there was not a part from extra v, so it will be zero eight.

09:01.150 --> 09:02.400
What is this equal to?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.080
What is W to do equal to?

09:04.080 --> 09:07.470
In this case it is equal to summation for all sets.

09:07.470 --> 09:09.120
You got movies, right?

09:09.480 --> 09:09.810
So.

09:10.870 --> 09:13.390
So let's figure this out in detail.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.460
Let's figure this out in detail and.

09:16.530 --> 09:17.910
It's have input.

09:18.090 --> 09:18.960
Okay, let's have this.

09:20.940 --> 09:23.370
So we have 010.

09:24.220 --> 09:25.270
101.

09:26.340 --> 09:27.300
000.

09:27.840 --> 09:32.850
So this this represents number of parts for Lent one.

09:33.060 --> 09:33.250
Eight.

09:33.300 --> 09:34.050
For Lent one.

09:36.330 --> 09:37.770
If I want to find out that.

09:37.830 --> 09:38.430
How many?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.480
But said there.

09:42.990 --> 09:47.310
On this particular location that is bungoma to sell this location.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.550
Poland to Poland, too.

09:50.850 --> 09:58.010
Then what I need is I want to go for all X from one to nnw1 comma u comics.

09:58.020 --> 10:00.420
That means in this matrix.

10:01.530 --> 10:04.230
And in this case, you is equal to one.

10:04.230 --> 10:09.000
And we want to do I'm just talking about this case, only this particular cell.

10:09.600 --> 10:14.940
But what will be when land is equal to what will be this particular value from 1 to 8?

10:15.750 --> 10:16.020
So.

10:17.370 --> 10:19.960
Use equal to one with equal to two eight.

10:20.070 --> 10:23.790
And what I have to do is I have to go for all the you go.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.840
My ex is in the blue one.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.210
That means I have to go for all the do here.

10:30.590 --> 10:35.780
But all eggs from one to N where w u comics u is one in this case.

10:35.840 --> 10:40.920
So basically I'm going over in the first row and I have an adjacency matrix.

10:41.240 --> 10:45.860
So let me make that adjacency matrix, which is right now equal to.

10:47.360 --> 10:47.690
This.

10:49.400 --> 10:54.290
Sell only the bridges I know equal to this matrix only note.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.930
So here what we have is we have equal to this.

10:57.530 --> 10:58.160
So what we don't.

10:58.190 --> 10:58.940
What we know is.

11:00.330 --> 11:05.700
We are going over the first row and multiplying the first row with this second column of their distancing

11:05.700 --> 11:12.090
matrix to obtain one comma two cell location in the Atlantic glycerol matrix rate.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.910
Because of this reclassification, it is.

11:16.260 --> 11:22.890
So what we have is we have one comma, one of length, one multiplied by just in symmetric, often comma

11:22.890 --> 11:23.100
one.

11:24.000 --> 11:32.490
Less 1 to 2 of length one and is dead apart from 2 to 2 offline one which is given to me by a syncing

11:32.490 --> 11:34.710
matrix +13.

11:35.780 --> 11:37.130
That means okay from one.

11:37.640 --> 11:42.270
Is it a part of land one in the first matrix into.

11:42.740 --> 11:45.320
Is there about from 3 to 8?

11:45.560 --> 11:46.880
So what is this?

11:46.910 --> 11:49.640
This is equal to five rule of the length.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.310
One cell multiplied by this second column of the land.

11:53.510 --> 11:56.030
Second column of the descent matrix.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.220
Biometrically descends the matrix.

11:58.220 --> 11:58.730
Because.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.020
This will tell me whether these are part of land, mine or not.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.270
I will not litigate.

12:05.270 --> 12:07.940
I want to figure out parts of entry.

12:07.940 --> 12:09.830
I want to figure out this matrix eight.

12:09.980 --> 12:13.880
So here we can see for one comma to Lyman blank poster with second column for one.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.300
Come up and I'll be multiplying first row with first column.

12:16.310 --> 12:17.720
And similarly for all these cells.

12:18.850 --> 12:19.090
Hey.

12:19.300 --> 12:20.650
So isn't this.

12:20.680 --> 12:25.360
That is metrics of land two equal to w one and do it.

12:26.730 --> 12:27.210
In the.

12:28.620 --> 12:33.570
That means multiplying the w one with the one now it is equal to 182.

12:33.570 --> 12:35.340
Let's talk about lint three.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.220
I want to find a puzzle entries within.

12:38.220 --> 12:42.360
I can easily say it in the similar fashion ID for all you come up with.

12:42.360 --> 12:42.960
I'm doing it.

12:43.080 --> 12:49.740
And if I start from you, I go to X in length to tell me how many parts are there from your do x of

12:49.740 --> 12:50.430
length two.

12:50.820 --> 12:54.260
And then tell me if about from x to V of length one.

12:55.900 --> 12:56.190
Right.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.820
So this will give me all the parts for Lent.

12:59.630 --> 13:02.020
RI So now what I have is what are the goods of religion?

13:02.020 --> 13:03.310
I'll have areas again.

13:03.310 --> 13:08.220
We'll have a theme similar because of religion, which is equal to for a particular you to be.

13:08.230 --> 13:09.760
It will be equal to W2.

13:11.100 --> 13:16.860
You do X, that means how many parts are there from offline to from your to x into.

13:16.980 --> 13:19.440
Is there a path from X to be of length?

13:19.440 --> 13:26.400
One that will be equal to the total number, but total number of parts of entry and similarly will sum

13:26.400 --> 13:27.090
this overall.

13:29.360 --> 13:36.200
All the undies we what we can see is the W3C equal to W doing do we where w.

13:37.420 --> 13:38.980
Who was equal to the blue one.

13:38.980 --> 13:40.840
And we were.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.450
The blue one is equal to that.

13:43.450 --> 13:48.730
We have already seen the blue one is equal to summation of eight and which is equal to the matrix.

13:48.730 --> 13:50.790
We are where we have three years.

13:50.800 --> 13:51.100
Right?

13:51.100 --> 13:53.640
So basically the blue one is equal to eight when.

13:54.870 --> 13:56.700
W2 is equals 282.

13:56.700 --> 14:04.110
If it is a square W3 is equal to AQ and W4 is equal straight to the power four and it will go on, so

14:04.110 --> 14:04.260
on.

14:04.290 --> 14:05.580
So what is W of G?

14:05.910 --> 14:07.100
It will be calculated.

14:07.100 --> 14:07.710
The power key.

14:08.690 --> 14:10.940
I hope we are getting this right.

14:11.510 --> 14:14.730
And why is it becoming multiplication of two matrices?

14:14.750 --> 14:15.690
Because what?

14:16.100 --> 14:17.900
Because we have this recursive relation.

14:18.880 --> 14:24.880
Where we have to find summation of these two values, which is the first row and the second column they.

14:26.790 --> 14:27.180
So.

14:27.510 --> 14:28.590
Yeah, just a second.

14:31.210 --> 14:33.490
So this was the thing that we had.

14:33.970 --> 14:35.410
Now what we want.

14:35.410 --> 14:37.800
Now what we've got is we want implemented, right?

14:37.810 --> 14:44.420
So here we can see that the constraints are really less and it's 50, but it is huge and divided.

14:44.830 --> 14:48.070
And I want to find note some metrics which is of.

14:49.250 --> 14:54.560
If you cross 52 deep poverty under the poverty, it is really big.

14:55.040 --> 14:55.860
How do I do this?

14:56.150 --> 14:57.200
How do I see all this?

14:57.860 --> 14:58.810
We've already done this.

14:58.820 --> 14:59.780
Dropping in the course.

15:02.190 --> 15:04.410
This can easily be solved using metrics exponential.

15:06.540 --> 15:11.820
If you do not know what it is, it has been discussed and just go over it and it's very easy.

15:11.820 --> 15:18.570
And I've also given you a very basic course, three basic code offered to call it out.

15:18.940 --> 15:21.000
Well, so what does Magical Exponential do?

15:21.000 --> 15:28.500
It finds it finds out power of some matters is really very less time, which is let's it and is a dimension

15:28.500 --> 15:31.560
of the matrix and grows in and is the.

15:35.420 --> 15:36.090
Of would they?

15:36.190 --> 15:43.300
So if I want to find out some metrics, poverty of dimension and then what I have is I have an Q which

15:43.300 --> 15:49.720
is multiplication in the log of key by using the binary exponential approach fast x when intuition.

15:50.810 --> 15:53.400
Well, which is not much in this case.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.630
So it will be 15 to 15 to 15 to 68.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.010
This will be.

15:59.090 --> 15:59.960
Four zeroes.

16:00.740 --> 16:01.640
35.

16:01.640 --> 16:02.360
Five, seven.

16:03.920 --> 16:08.930
So we did one, two, three, four, five, six, 4 to 7 and about six, which is not much which we

16:08.930 --> 16:11.810
can do to this question.

16:12.200 --> 16:16.340
This problem will help you understand how this matrix exponential should work.

16:16.340 --> 16:17.930
And how can I use it?

16:18.710 --> 16:18.940
Well.

16:20.630 --> 16:21.890
So this also.

16:23.260 --> 16:27.130
I'm being reminded of something that I learned in the college time, which is.

16:28.390 --> 16:29.860
There was a markov chain.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.110
In stochastic processes.

16:32.620 --> 16:36.250
So the Miami chain had a very similar functionality like this.

16:36.850 --> 16:43.060
It was very similar that if I want to find out something of length after iterations and just find out

16:43.150 --> 16:46.150
the key minus one iteration and added one iteration later.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.570
It's similar to this approach.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.330
So see you guys in the next part.
