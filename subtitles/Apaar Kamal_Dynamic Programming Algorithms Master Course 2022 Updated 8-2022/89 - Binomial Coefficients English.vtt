00:01.000 --> 00:06.230
Everyone, welcome to the Commodore Rex and we will see that.

00:06.240 --> 00:10.200
How is dynamic programming involved in material problems?

00:10.800 --> 00:15.030
Well, there are finite examples because there are infinity within that metrics.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.030
All cities have a.

00:18.290 --> 00:18.770
Religion.

00:18.770 --> 00:20.240
They like it because of religion.

00:20.720 --> 00:27.860
So I hear I have one of those cities which will be used a lot in the upcoming lectures, and also it's

00:27.860 --> 00:28.730
very important.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.240
To understand this and see.

00:31.250 --> 00:36.140
Yeah, well, firstly I have this binomial coefficient which is nothing where you know, you all must

00:36.140 --> 00:39.290
have heard about it, which is NC eight.

00:39.950 --> 00:44.080
So this forms the combinations part in the permutations and combinations section.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.680
What is inside?

00:46.100 --> 00:47.770
There are two ways to define it or them.

00:48.000 --> 00:48.890
Either way, there's one.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.050
But I've chosen these two.

00:51.410 --> 00:53.630
The first way we can see that it is defined is.

00:55.470 --> 01:00.840
The cooperation of to deepen our care in the expansion of one place, at least through the power and

01:01.260 --> 01:01.460
aid.

01:01.470 --> 01:05.790
For example, what is a one plus six base for the power?

01:05.790 --> 01:11.900
Two, it is nothing but x squared plus two x less one eight.

01:12.090 --> 01:14.790
So if I write it this way, it becomes one two in one.

01:14.790 --> 01:17.070
The coefficient eight and.

01:18.610 --> 01:18.880
Yeah.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.750
So if I want to find out what is.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.700
Two because here and it's two we can see and it's true.

01:27.030 --> 01:32.460
If they want to find out what is to see one way, then what I can do is I have to experiment plus x

01:32.460 --> 01:37.690
squared, which is I went to the x squared plus to explosion and then okay.

01:38.040 --> 01:38.680
Oh --.

01:38.710 --> 01:38.790
Yeah.

01:38.790 --> 01:42.480
What I need to do is I need to just check what is the x is to the public here.

01:43.110 --> 01:48.570
What is access to the power one because k is equal to one x dubai one is one and it's over vision days

01:48.810 --> 01:49.770
to eight.

01:49.980 --> 01:52.060
So therefore to c one is equal to two.

01:54.110 --> 01:55.940
Similarly, we can do the same for.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.390
When does excuse which is nothing.

01:59.390 --> 02:01.250
But I think the excu.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.000
Less.

02:07.250 --> 02:10.340
Three X squared plus x plus four.

02:10.400 --> 02:10.730
Sorry.

02:11.710 --> 02:12.160
Mr..

02:14.680 --> 02:15.240
It is.

02:15.250 --> 02:16.040
Excuse me.

02:16.180 --> 02:18.190
I'll tell you a way to remember this study.

02:18.910 --> 02:19.690
It is excuse.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.230
Plus three x squared plus three x plus one.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.590
So it is one, three, three.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.790
But and these are relation between one, two, one and one, three, three, one that I will discuss.

02:31.930 --> 02:35.380
And that will come from the passcode strangled.

02:35.890 --> 02:44.050
Similarly, it's also the it is also defined as the number of ways of choosing objects out of an object

02:44.290 --> 02:46.340
in which it and seeking it.

02:46.770 --> 02:48.490
Let's see what is possible.

02:48.530 --> 02:53.590
The thing I consider consider passcode strangled is of as a wonder of the world.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.090
And let's see.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.700
This is Pascal saying that we all know.

03:00.780 --> 03:01.410
We are, all of us.

03:01.410 --> 03:05.460
Basically, basically, this is our triangle.

03:05.460 --> 03:08.940
And in the past we can see it as 111, one, two, one, one, three, three, one.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.920
I hope we can find a relation at eight.

03:11.070 --> 03:11.880
One, two, one.

03:13.130 --> 03:15.200
13318.

03:15.350 --> 03:20.410
Similarly will have 146421, which is, let's say, explicit.

03:20.630 --> 03:22.890
When playing this to the bar for eight.

03:22.940 --> 03:24.260
So the best way is simple.

03:24.710 --> 03:27.110
Just write down the efficient.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.920
And then just fill these values with just one or.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.900
Six for one always.

03:37.920 --> 03:42.090
So this is one bless expansion and bless this rhubarb vortex.

03:42.930 --> 03:43.800
I hope you got this.

03:45.030 --> 03:46.110
Let's find a relation.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.490
How can we remember this?

03:47.820 --> 03:50.670
It's very easy if you have 1 to 1.

03:51.180 --> 03:54.090
And then I have to come with one, three, three, one, which is nothing.

03:54.090 --> 03:58.380
When we start with one, we end with one, and one of them are the numbers, but in numbers and nothing

03:58.380 --> 04:01.360
but the sum of the and figurative bit.

04:01.990 --> 04:02.760
One little twist.

04:02.760 --> 04:03.090
Three.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.920
And two plus one is again three.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.240
Now let's add them.

04:07.190 --> 04:09.500
I will have three consecutive pairs.

04:09.590 --> 04:15.680
So if I had them for six more and of course we'll add one one in the end and let's add them again.

04:16.870 --> 04:17.950
This will give me five.

04:18.370 --> 04:23.710
This gives me ten, then five and let's add one one.

04:23.720 --> 04:29.140
So as you can see, the next room is one five, ten, ten, five, one.

04:29.140 --> 04:30.520
And there are various other.

04:32.700 --> 04:36.870
A pattern involved in this, and it actually fascinates me.

04:37.950 --> 04:38.690
Let's see this.

04:38.700 --> 04:43.380
And so as you can see, the first diagonal is nothing but 1111, one, one.

04:43.950 --> 04:50.610
The second analyst got read one plus two plus three plus four, plus counting numbers that produce triangular

04:50.610 --> 04:52.160
numbers for wrangling numbers.

04:52.170 --> 04:52.800
It is one.

04:53.880 --> 04:58.020
Plus two is three plus three gives.

04:58.020 --> 05:02.820
Six plus four gives and lets five gives 15.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.030
Plus six gives 21 insulin.

05:06.510 --> 05:14.640
Are you seeing this that the differences between the conservative numbers of this ranking and the third

05:14.640 --> 05:18.260
diagonal is increasing or is this eight?

05:18.630 --> 05:19.440
I hope you got this.

05:19.680 --> 05:24.330
The similarly days of pattern which can be observed in one for ten, 20, 25.

05:25.500 --> 05:29.010
I hope you can find this, but if you want me to find this, I can do that too.

05:29.310 --> 05:30.060
I leave it up to you.

05:30.060 --> 05:30.810
It's very easy.

05:30.870 --> 05:35.490
They just take their differences and see what the pattern in the differences.

05:36.470 --> 05:36.660
Well.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.740
So all of these theories have a name.

05:38.750 --> 05:41.690
So there's a triangle in numbers and this will be on the series, the other ones.

05:42.850 --> 05:50.330
But the second thing that I want to show is that there's a relation between Squires of the numbers and

05:50.600 --> 05:50.860
this.

05:50.870 --> 05:52.850
And let me show this.

05:53.330 --> 05:54.350
So what is okay?

05:54.950 --> 05:56.570
What is Foursquare?

05:56.630 --> 05:59.930
Foursquare is nothing but X plus ten, right?

06:00.230 --> 06:01.240
What is three square?

06:01.560 --> 06:02.750
Let let me circle this.

06:04.180 --> 06:05.260
It's a regular.

06:10.760 --> 06:11.720
What is three square?

06:12.530 --> 06:14.420
The square is nothing but.

06:17.490 --> 06:19.560
The best rate that right.

06:20.790 --> 06:25.500
So for three we can see the right part and the slight diagonal part to all these three.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.360
Combine the three triangle.

06:27.600 --> 06:32.340
Similarly for two we can see that two squared is nothing but one plus three.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.410
Similarly, for five, we can see.

06:35.630 --> 06:36.770
Which is endless.

06:36.950 --> 06:40.880
15 by ABC Vice Credit goes to 1015 I hope you got this.

06:41.400 --> 06:48.200
So it was a very interesting property that I saw, and I saw this on the Web site called Matisse Fun.

06:48.500 --> 06:53.540
Now you can search and look at the properties of this Pascal's triangle as well.

06:54.260 --> 07:02.090
And yeah, so let's see the next properties that I liked and then we'll discuss how do we get rid of

07:02.090 --> 07:02.280
them?

07:02.290 --> 07:06.920
Which of course we have seen it is nothing but some of the above to provided the sum of the other two

07:07.340 --> 07:07.630
eight.

07:08.090 --> 07:11.210
We will see that will come to the derivation by using dynamic programming.

07:11.940 --> 07:13.190
Well yeah.

07:13.400 --> 07:18.860
So the next one is the some of the horizontal rows for these are some of the first of one, then two

07:18.860 --> 07:23.120
then for the need, then in 32, then 64, eight and so on.

07:23.510 --> 07:29.010
So here you can, you see can you observe a pattern in the in the same here the sum is nothing but to

07:29.030 --> 07:37.220
restore the power in 8 to 2 is above a01, two, three, four and so on, which would eventually eventually

07:37.700 --> 07:41.420
see that and see zero plus, NC one plus and see two.

07:41.780 --> 07:48.770
So until and see is equal to how much duration the about eight because these are the confessions the

07:48.770 --> 07:50.210
binomial coefficients of this.

07:51.090 --> 07:51.900
I hope you got this.

07:52.880 --> 07:53.120
A.

07:54.100 --> 07:58.630
And the next one is also very interesting, which is what is 11?

07:58.630 --> 07:59.530
Is it about zero?

07:59.560 --> 08:00.130
It's one.

08:00.850 --> 08:01.210
What is it?

08:01.210 --> 08:02.260
11 is two but one.

08:02.290 --> 08:07.120
11 eight similarly is 12113311, four, six, four, one.

08:07.420 --> 08:12.460
Now you can see it is 1610518, which is 15101051.

08:12.790 --> 08:19.600
So this is because here you can see here you can notice that we have a double digit number eight.

08:19.870 --> 08:22.780
So what we'll do is we'll start writing this from the right hand.

08:22.780 --> 08:26.560
So let's write this 510.

08:27.070 --> 08:28.870
What happens when we get to zero?

08:28.900 --> 08:31.170
We have one carry over the template.

08:31.990 --> 08:34.060
Similarly, for the next, we have another zero.

08:34.060 --> 08:35.260
So zero plus one is.

08:36.600 --> 08:36.810
Okay.

08:36.810 --> 08:37.740
Let me write it this way.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.490
This was standard two digit number.

08:41.730 --> 08:47.880
I will kind of try to overlap, but I'll just take one last digit and overlap with ten and then we'll

08:47.880 --> 08:49.710
have five and then we'll have one.

08:50.190 --> 08:56.970
If I had this one elegant 150161, which is 111 listed above five.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.710
Similarly, 411 is to the above with six.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.390
I will look at this home.

09:00.420 --> 09:01.560
How am I getting this number?

09:02.130 --> 09:04.200
We'll have one 615.

09:04.350 --> 09:09.650
So 15 one should overlap with 20 zero eight and then again 15 here.

09:09.660 --> 09:12.490
And then we have six and then we have one.

09:12.840 --> 09:13.540
Let me add it.

09:13.650 --> 09:20.520
So it is 1651771, which is 11 is to the bar, which is in this way.

09:20.520 --> 09:21.030
Interesting.

09:22.090 --> 09:26.230
That series is kind of becoming the power of 11.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.760
So I hope you understood all the property of Pascal's triangle.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.080
And this is important.

09:32.110 --> 09:32.670
You need to.

09:32.710 --> 09:38.140
You should keep these things in mind because we never know when there's a problem which demands one

09:38.140 --> 09:38.500
of these.

09:39.310 --> 09:40.780
And then you might be searching for them.

09:41.580 --> 09:43.450
Well, then let's understand.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.140
How do we.

09:45.070 --> 09:47.470
How do we come to this particular.

09:49.510 --> 09:54.810
Additionally, we saw that any number, any number, let's pick up let's pick up this ten.

09:54.820 --> 10:01.930
It is nothing but six +46 nothing but three plus three, eight and similarly seven days nothing with

10:01.930 --> 10:03.190
35 plus 35.

10:03.220 --> 10:06.460
It is nothing but seven and one eight.

10:07.180 --> 10:08.610
How how are they?

10:09.070 --> 10:10.240
How is that some equal?

10:10.270 --> 10:12.550
Why is there something called a two for that?

10:12.550 --> 10:14.530
What we'll do is we'll go into dynamic programming.

10:15.100 --> 10:17.800
You will see what is the meaning of the end, right?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.290
Sankar means using.

10:21.350 --> 10:22.010
He objects.

10:23.130 --> 10:23.580
Out of.

10:26.390 --> 10:31.130
Objects I think offered in that environment were like.

10:31.850 --> 10:33.510
Like, just think about this problem.

10:33.510 --> 10:41.240
Let's say you have been given this problem that you have to find out the negative relation of using

10:41.240 --> 10:42.470
key objects out of an object.

10:42.950 --> 10:44.330
What options do you have?

10:44.600 --> 10:45.530
Let's say what what?

10:45.710 --> 10:47.810
What options do you have for the kid object?

10:50.800 --> 10:54.100
The option for Kate object is at the rally included.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.500
Include means I choose it or I will not choose it.

10:58.510 --> 10:59.710
That means I will excluded.

11:01.190 --> 11:05.750
So if I include the kid object, then what does it say?

11:06.410 --> 11:13.420
It is equal to telling me the number 10 million number of ways in which I can choose K minus one elements

11:13.820 --> 11:16.400
from n minus one element and I'm including gay.

11:16.460 --> 11:19.820
So basically this n minus one becomes N and k, minus one becomes key.

11:20.630 --> 11:23.630
So basically what I'm saying is if I have five balls.

11:25.580 --> 11:26.990
And I have.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.460
I'm using a six ball.

11:28.850 --> 11:35.300
I'm asking you if I have to include if my six ball is included in my selection.

11:35.840 --> 11:41.540
If my six ball is included in my selection, then in how many number of base I can choose?

11:42.290 --> 11:43.040
Five balls.

11:43.610 --> 11:46.190
Okay, so let's say I have two, literally four balls.

11:46.730 --> 11:47.000
Okay.

11:47.120 --> 11:52.190
I would select for out of wooden balls at six eight, but.

11:53.790 --> 11:54.060
Yeah.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.400
Let me go over this again.

11:58.220 --> 11:59.480
Let's end is equal to six.

11:59.480 --> 12:00.410
And I have six pots.

12:02.820 --> 12:04.230
And I have to choose only fourballs.

12:04.710 --> 12:06.840
What option do this last ball have?

12:06.870 --> 12:08.370
The last ball has two options.

12:09.030 --> 12:14.770
Whether it will be included in all these four balls in one of these four balls, or it will be not included

12:14.770 --> 12:15.090
at all.

12:15.510 --> 12:18.540
If it is included in one of these four balls, then what else?

12:18.540 --> 12:20.700
Simply say, look for these five balls.

12:20.700 --> 12:26.970
Tell me the number of ways of choosing three balls because I'm including this ball in as my fourth volley.

12:28.910 --> 12:29.760
I hope you got this.

12:30.390 --> 12:34.740
But if I'm including the last ball as the fourth one, then I just asked him in the province of choosing

12:34.800 --> 12:37.650
three balls out of the remaining balls, which is right here.

12:38.280 --> 12:44.100
And if I am not including it as my fourth ball or any of the any one of these four balls, let's say

12:44.100 --> 12:44.970
I'm not including it.

12:46.530 --> 12:46.950
Then what?

12:46.980 --> 12:48.540
What does the relation become?

12:48.880 --> 12:55.860
Look, let's not include this then simply what we have to say is Jews, Bible, Jews, four words out

12:55.860 --> 12:57.720
of the remaining box, which is five.

12:58.290 --> 13:04.350
So basically it means N minus one, c k because I'm not including the current role in my selection.

13:04.650 --> 13:08.370
If I'm not including the current involved, still I need the cable trade.

13:08.550 --> 13:09.890
So I have many options left.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.550
I have, and minus one options left.

13:11.820 --> 13:13.380
And I have to select keyboards out of them.

13:14.110 --> 13:20.190
So here you can see it's very easy that and c odd is equal to nothing but and minus one.

13:20.190 --> 13:21.300
C are minus one.

13:21.480 --> 13:21.840
Okay.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.670
And I'm digging out and there I'm digging.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.590
Let me take the case.

13:27.590 --> 13:33.470
Equals to and minus 1ck minus one because of I'm including it to limit the number of ways of shooting

13:33.470 --> 13:38.920
the other balls plus mn t plus and minus one.

13:39.380 --> 13:40.970
The K which means.

13:41.990 --> 13:46.460
I'm not including the current pollinator to limit the number of ways of choosing that many walls from

13:46.460 --> 13:47.150
the remaining ones.

13:48.890 --> 13:49.850
So what is this?

13:49.850 --> 13:51.380
If I died, if I.

13:53.190 --> 13:56.910
Replace it with iota or letter f eight to F.

13:57.610 --> 14:04.690
NW Obama care is close to a fourth and minus one comma k minus one plus f of.

14:06.320 --> 14:10.700
And minus one hit rate and let's replace it by IED.

14:10.730 --> 14:13.160
So it becomes EF IED.

14:14.460 --> 14:16.830
Is it close to half of a minus one?

14:16.830 --> 14:17.910
J Minus one.

14:19.450 --> 14:19.900
Less.

14:20.980 --> 14:23.200
F I minus one.

14:27.010 --> 14:28.990
I hope this becomes clear.

14:30.580 --> 14:37.060
So that's why we are seeing the above approach, which is one, but it is one one.

14:37.090 --> 14:38.410
So let's start from the third one.

14:39.010 --> 14:39.700
The idea.

14:40.990 --> 14:43.030
The second one will be equal to I, minus one.

14:43.270 --> 14:48.010
Minus one, which is this and I'm minus one g, which is this.

14:48.430 --> 14:53.170
Instead of looking it as a pyramid, let's see it as a.

14:54.230 --> 14:54.710
Triangle.

14:55.340 --> 14:56.090
So let me just.

14:57.370 --> 14:58.000
Make this.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.370
Similarly this.

15:06.640 --> 15:06.850
Yeah.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.890
Just give me 1/2.

15:13.460 --> 15:14.120
From the religion.

15:14.120 --> 15:14.540
What we have.

15:14.570 --> 15:16.070
One, one, one.

15:16.430 --> 15:17.150
Now, similarly.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.320
So RFID.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.190
That means this.

15:19.610 --> 15:22.100
All the leftmost column is one, right?

15:22.100 --> 15:25.490
Because it is equal to NC 084.

15:25.490 --> 15:25.850
All in.

15:26.270 --> 15:33.200
Now what will be this value will be equal to this plus this which is namely this will be equal to this

15:33.200 --> 15:34.830
plus there's nothing else.

15:34.830 --> 15:36.220
So it will be one eight.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.960
Now, again, this cell, which is.

15:40.760 --> 15:44.300
Third row and first column rate if I start from zero.

15:46.890 --> 15:48.310
So three in one, right.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.290
What does it equal to?

15:49.290 --> 15:50.130
It equals from nothing.

15:50.130 --> 15:55.580
Where it was zero plus two to less 218 bridges to the similarly three.

15:55.590 --> 16:01.350
Similarly, when it is equal to I minus one do minus one, which is the diagonal left and I minus one

16:01.350 --> 16:03.910
day, which is just above column it.

16:04.080 --> 16:08.370
So this is just an example of how are we reaching to this window?

16:09.330 --> 16:09.550
Eight.

16:10.170 --> 16:18.000
It is because of Erika's evolution and how their evolution from the anime programming to, well, we

16:18.000 --> 16:19.070
all can code this language.

16:19.070 --> 16:19.710
It's very easy.

16:19.710 --> 16:21.020
I leave the code up to you.

16:21.030 --> 16:26.640
I just wanted you to know about some some things about the particles triangle and the binomial coefficients,

16:26.640 --> 16:28.860
because we'll be watching it in the further videos.

16:29.760 --> 16:30.000
Well.

16:31.200 --> 16:31.560
Thank you.
