00:00.790 --> 00:02.860
There's one thing I forgot to add.

00:02.860 --> 00:06.040
Saudi making a new reading for it, which is this.

00:08.240 --> 00:13.400
The second part, it does not pass through it, which is nothing but effort into smacks of ethics.

00:14.410 --> 00:18.500
I just forgot to add it into the code, so let me quickly add it into the code.

00:21.930 --> 00:22.230
Okay.

00:22.980 --> 00:26.270
Well, sometimes it happens that I miss the kids while eating.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.380
But I did already discuss it with you.

00:28.380 --> 00:29.760
Right in the name of duty.

00:30.730 --> 00:36.010
So I've got it is nothing but maximum for all ethics because now we may not pass through the current

00:36.160 --> 00:36.460
rate.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.260
It's invigorating everyone over there.

00:39.500 --> 00:47.260
And here also if I'm making it, Max and Max, to let me take Max of f current bomber.

00:47.500 --> 00:47.790
Yes.

00:49.200 --> 00:49.550
So.

00:49.640 --> 00:49.970
Yeah.

00:50.030 --> 00:53.180
So now what will happen is after and will be updated here also.

00:53.180 --> 00:54.800
And it will be updated in the end.

00:55.790 --> 00:57.380
So let me build this.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.030
So this was a big test case.

01:00.060 --> 01:05.840
And that's why that's why, you know, here the time is actually passing through and that's why we're

01:05.840 --> 01:06.800
getting the correct answer.

01:08.710 --> 01:11.860
So this is now this should be job working.

01:11.860 --> 01:12.040
Really?

01:12.050 --> 01:12.640
Solutions.

01:12.940 --> 01:13.240
Yeah.

01:13.420 --> 01:15.760
Pardon me for this line 19 and.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.740
But we already discussed this.

01:17.750 --> 01:21.300
They did admit they may not pass through the cutting and.
