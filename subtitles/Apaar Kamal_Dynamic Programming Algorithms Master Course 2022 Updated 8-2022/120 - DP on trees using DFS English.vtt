00:00.630 --> 00:04.800
So in this lecture we will be wearing the same thing.

00:05.130 --> 00:09.760
That is Murdoch's cover, but we'll be calling it in DFS menu.

00:10.410 --> 00:10.660
Right.

00:11.040 --> 00:16.350
So of course guys are DB was also DFS manner, but that was pure recursion and then we optimized it

00:16.350 --> 00:17.280
memories that right.

00:17.550 --> 00:23.590
But now what I'll do is I just perform one DFS and in there DFS will be feeling the values right but

00:23.610 --> 00:27.600
they are difference rate and you'll notice a difference when the electrons but.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.000
Please see this.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.550
What I do, I just initially call it the office.

00:32.670 --> 00:36.450
I started the office from one plus zero at its parent.

00:37.260 --> 00:44.160
And what I do is, after calling the office, I will just go into nothing but a minimum of one zero

00:44.160 --> 00:44.700
comma.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.140
DP 111.

00:47.430 --> 00:49.050
So that's what is.

00:50.330 --> 00:51.710
What was needed in the interim.

00:51.860 --> 00:56.960
Performing a DFS, what will do DFS would be performative is on the whole Tre and Phil, the DP values

00:57.230 --> 01:00.720
this DP 88 So firstly, let's initialize this debris.

01:03.030 --> 01:06.300
And it's that idea, this void, the office.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.840
And in this one, I haven't encouraged an experience.

01:09.840 --> 01:15.750
So here you can see I haven't taken big or not while I guess it's great because when I'm performing

01:15.750 --> 01:21.990
to you but I'm going on every not exactly once correct because that would be do and if I'm going on

01:21.990 --> 01:25.350
every node exactly once then what I will do is.

01:26.450 --> 01:33.830
I've been away from the office and whenever I'm going to an hour I call for its download against performative

01:33.830 --> 01:36.410
is on its children and then I feel the values.

01:37.110 --> 01:40.520
But what I do is nothing but four or two eggs in.

01:41.500 --> 01:45.280
We are designed to list if X is not equal to pairing.

01:45.640 --> 01:50.020
What I'll do is I'll simply say, okay, so before moving forward, let me fill these cases, which

01:50.020 --> 01:52.720
is the P current zero is zero.

01:55.350 --> 01:57.210
And the big orange one is one.

01:57.240 --> 02:03.120
So basically I'm handling both the cases in one DFS only, and you'll realize this further.

02:03.120 --> 02:10.260
Also, if an X is not equal to pairing realities, I DFS go perform DFS on x and current is the new

02:10.260 --> 02:12.620
bin and after performing this DFS.

02:12.630 --> 02:13.530
So this is important.

02:14.490 --> 02:18.960
If I okay let me facilitated then we'll move back to.

02:19.910 --> 02:21.350
But what is deep current zero?

02:21.800 --> 02:24.500
If I'm not taking the current one, I have to take the others one.

02:24.500 --> 02:24.740
Right.

02:25.010 --> 02:28.190
That means plus equals to BP x one.

02:28.580 --> 02:28.970
Correct.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.790
And what is the p current one?

02:31.970 --> 02:34.840
That means I'm taking the current naught.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.080
It means I'm in.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.760
May not take the dilute.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.870
Beaumont the peaks one.

02:42.890 --> 02:43.280
But it.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.020
This is normal.

02:47.800 --> 02:48.580
We have a solution.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.200
I'm just performing a deal.

02:50.380 --> 02:54.850
If you don't see this and this, you can easily see it's.

02:54.850 --> 02:57.580
Nothing would be if it's not going to the live.

02:57.580 --> 02:57.730
No.

02:57.740 --> 03:02.650
Normally if this involve performing their DFS, what I'm doing is I'm trying to fill the DB.

03:03.860 --> 03:06.050
But I just remember one thing.

03:07.130 --> 03:10.370
That this is a lot different from this.

03:11.290 --> 03:11.820
Eight two.

03:11.860 --> 03:12.730
This will not work.

03:12.880 --> 03:13.810
Why would this not work?

03:13.810 --> 03:20.920
Because I'm filling some current value with using the x value without actually killing the x values.

03:21.730 --> 03:22.070
C d.

03:22.090 --> 03:25.790
B of x will only be filled if the fs x is called first.

03:26.860 --> 03:30.550
But what's happening is I'm I'm under I'm carrying note.

03:30.820 --> 03:35.500
I've called go perform DFS on X what all it's in and I'm just performing some DFS.

03:35.890 --> 03:39.700
I'm going to perform that behave as I'm coming back from DFS eight so.

03:42.230 --> 03:45.590
I mean back from the office.

03:45.950 --> 03:55.520
That means MP X will be filled because when I performed the office one x, that means the x zero must

03:55.520 --> 04:00.910
have initialized the explanation, it must have initialized and this value must have been in 4x8.

04:00.920 --> 04:06.800
Its deep states have been filled after I come back here on this line 90.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.060
Correct.

04:09.030 --> 04:10.320
This is very important to understand.

04:10.770 --> 04:18.420
I know this might be confusing, but if you've read this section of the course, then it should not

04:18.420 --> 04:23.370
be confusing because first the DFS is being performed and then we are failing the values.

04:23.580 --> 04:24.930
Not right.

04:25.560 --> 04:26.940
So in this case, what will happen?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.980
The DFS performed his field.

04:29.010 --> 04:31.590
Now I can use to be fully depicted.

04:33.120 --> 04:37.680
So I'm using the pigs to fill be beginning and finally I'm printing whatever the minimum.

04:37.680 --> 04:42.030
So when the defense values perform its deep values this field and just printing the minimum.

04:42.810 --> 04:46.530
But this is another solution for the same problem.

04:46.610 --> 04:48.120
So this is just performing a DFS.

04:48.540 --> 04:52.380
Of course we can also do it using a BFS.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.450
We have to, but we have to start with the reverse BFS.

04:56.190 --> 04:58.590
If you want me to call it, I can call it using DFS.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.510
Also, I can explain you the code.

05:01.350 --> 05:07.230
In that case, what we do is we will start from the leaf nodes and will move upwards and perform a BFS

05:07.230 --> 05:08.340
and keep on feeling the values.

05:09.090 --> 05:10.920
Because for any DP current I need to be.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.240
And maybe I can leave that code to you.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.530
That how to.

05:17.610 --> 05:22.680
Or in the next Bible, what we'll do is I simply couldn't convey it.

05:22.950 --> 05:27.990
I will simply go with the beliefs approach of this same problem, isn't it?

05:28.350 --> 05:29.160
We'll see in the next part.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.930
Everyone, I hope this is very clear.

05:31.470 --> 05:31.830
Thanks.
