00:00.780 --> 00:05.220
So let's use Musk with Musk to optimize this code and.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.070
Right, so I don't need a certain rate.

00:08.310 --> 00:11.430
So let me remove this part that I don't need a suit.

00:11.640 --> 00:18.090
I'd simply say that Hamiltonian part already goes to the be a comma zero, not zero.

00:18.390 --> 00:21.780
So what I'll do is I just simply simply say one left shift, right?

00:22.290 --> 00:26.010
So if I use zero, that means one bit over two certifies one.

00:26.010 --> 00:27.270
That means it has two.

00:27.270 --> 00:29.520
Otherwise it is for, otherwise it is it.

00:29.880 --> 00:36.060
So basically there's a bit basically there's an integer which every bit of that integer is representing

00:36.060 --> 00:37.320
a vertex here.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.100
Right.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.140
And now let's come up.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.690
Okay, so let's see in the base case.

00:42.690 --> 00:43.830
So what will be the base case?

00:43.830 --> 00:46.050
The base case will be now very simple.

00:46.050 --> 00:46.350
Okay.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.170
Before that, let me remove this and let's call it Musk.

00:49.860 --> 00:50.150
Great.

00:50.490 --> 00:58.890
So if Musk is equal to do this to the power and minus one, correct to this one, minus one will have

00:58.890 --> 00:59.940
all this bit set.

01:00.120 --> 01:04.020
If all the bits are set, that means now my musk contains all the vertex.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.730
That means I was able to visit all the words.

01:06.210 --> 01:06.490
Right?

01:06.870 --> 01:09.510
So if that said, I learned true.

01:09.540 --> 01:13.470
So this is a new base case and memorization.

01:13.470 --> 01:15.030
I'll come to memorization later.

01:15.030 --> 01:17.580
Or or we can come to memorization right now.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.090
So let's keep a memo end.

01:21.090 --> 01:23.520
And this will be nothing but one lecture then.

01:25.290 --> 01:31.650
Because this mosque can take the values from 0 to 2 days to the power and minus one.

01:32.040 --> 01:36.750
And it can take any of those values because any of those said can be possible.

01:37.290 --> 01:41.850
So I have to take and Goma one wanted to do a power to this just power in which is one letter of ten.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.460
But I hope this makes sense.

01:44.760 --> 01:51.480
So what I will simply say I simply say if memo current and if whatever the masculine is, if it is not

01:51.480 --> 01:53.400
equal to minus one, I simply.

01:54.410 --> 01:55.010
Return it.

01:55.640 --> 02:01.280
So I hope it's making some sense that we are just this is nothing out of it and there's nothing different.

02:01.370 --> 02:06.650
Basically, it's just that if whenever we are keeping a cent instead of a third, we just keep a mask

02:06.650 --> 02:12.740
because a mask isn't in it and every bit of that integer can represent a verdict and tell me things

02:12.740 --> 02:15.720
about it, whether it is visited or not and other things.

02:16.820 --> 02:17.120
Hmm.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.430
So now I want to.

02:20.210 --> 02:20.480
Okay.

02:20.510 --> 02:25.520
So this check was very simple that if X is not in the set, then visited.

02:25.520 --> 02:25.850
Right.

02:26.060 --> 02:28.520
So how can I check whether X is in mask or not?

02:29.060 --> 02:30.650
Then that simply means whether.

02:32.150 --> 02:37.220
Xt bit of musk is said or not.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.110
So how can I take that?

02:39.200 --> 02:41.090
Weather expert of Musk said.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.720
I literally microchipped an X and one.

02:45.170 --> 02:49.550
This will tell me whether the bid offered is set or not.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.610
So what I want is I want it to be not set.

02:52.700 --> 02:53.000
Right.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.670
So I'll just take a note here, because if it is not there, it means that X was not in the set and

02:58.670 --> 03:00.050
I can go and visit it.

03:00.710 --> 03:01.430
I can try that.

03:01.430 --> 03:02.630
But so.

03:03.570 --> 03:04.350
Let me remove it.

03:04.950 --> 03:08.430
And now what will happen if that bill was not said?

03:08.430 --> 03:12.270
And I'm going on to the note, which is I want to include it in domestic.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.330
How can I include it in domestic?

03:14.340 --> 03:18.230
I simply say mosque or one letter page.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.190
That means I'm setting that building the mosque.

03:20.220 --> 03:23.580
Okay, now I'm visiting it, Margaret said.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.160
That means now it is in the graph.

03:25.470 --> 03:31.020
And finally, this will be the memo current.

03:32.750 --> 03:33.290
Musk.

03:33.290 --> 03:36.530
Let me bring you in and check if there's something wrong and there's nothing wrong.

03:36.530 --> 03:42.470
But there's one thing wrong that this memo will not work because I know zero and I have a I have a tech

03:42.470 --> 03:43.310
one minus one eight.

03:43.670 --> 03:44.810
So let me memorize it.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.840
Memo, Memo said.

03:51.570 --> 03:54.110
Memo Maintenance Funds ISO.

03:55.380 --> 03:55.890
Memo.

03:57.080 --> 03:57.340
Right.

03:58.660 --> 03:58.930
Good.

03:59.170 --> 04:06.970
Now, as you can see that we have designs of one and this is a normal DP plasmid mask.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.490
DP with bit masking, right?

04:08.530 --> 04:09.730
So I hope you understood it.

04:09.730 --> 04:10.870
And it's a very easy thing.

04:11.140 --> 04:13.780
It just that just you just need to understand one thing that.

04:16.100 --> 04:19.550
If I have a number, if I have an integer X, I write it as binary.

04:19.760 --> 04:27.960
That binary will tell me which particular way to set or not and decide which are like visited and not

04:27.960 --> 04:29.420
separate and not visited.

04:30.380 --> 04:32.210
So basically it is a bit mask.

04:32.330 --> 04:34.160
It is masking things inside it.

04:34.310 --> 04:34.570
Right.

04:34.850 --> 04:42.380
So every integer contains a set and what is said is nothing but the indexes of those bits which asset

04:43.250 --> 04:43.550
write.

04:44.510 --> 04:46.670
So yeah, that's it.

04:46.790 --> 04:50.710
And this is a top down approach.

04:50.720 --> 04:56.220
In the next we do, I again, I try to make a bottom up approach also just to make things more clear.

04:56.720 --> 04:57.070
Right.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.000
And then we will move on to different debate.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.210
But my solutions always remember these problems.

05:03.470 --> 05:10.040
This debate mask is generally required where they then factorial brute force solution taking place.

05:11.260 --> 05:12.860
The factories are a unique place there.

05:12.860 --> 05:15.490
We can optimize it by a bit much.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.060
So what is the complexity of this?

05:17.660 --> 05:22.370
We know the complexity of any solution is nothing but the number of states and the work that's going

05:22.370 --> 05:22.850
inside.

05:23.880 --> 05:27.440
Let's assume that my work is very small or essentially it's just not big.

05:27.530 --> 05:36.200
Let's assume it's late so we can easily see that the yeah, this the number of state is nothing but

05:36.200 --> 05:38.670
anything due to this to the power and rates of it.

05:39.080 --> 05:43.010
So in short, this is a and to do this is the power in solution.

05:43.610 --> 05:46.580
Otherwise the brute force would be an end factorial solution.

05:46.850 --> 05:52.760
And we know that n factorial for bigger number is very, very, very greater than do this to the power

05:52.760 --> 05:57.350
and VI because into this the power and we are always multiplying it by two.

05:57.350 --> 05:57.680
Right.

05:57.890 --> 06:03.680
But in in fact when in fact what happens one in two to find in the three find but 9 to 4 in to five

06:03.680 --> 06:04.910
and to six and to seven.

06:05.270 --> 06:09.530
So you can see we are always multiplying of the numbers greater than two, but here we're always multiplying

06:09.530 --> 06:10.760
it with two.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.090
So and factorial is very huge, very big.

06:14.090 --> 06:19.220
Then to reach the power in 20 factorial will be a very big value.

06:19.220 --> 06:24.320
But to do this to the power 20 will be approximately ten is the about six, only eight.

06:24.980 --> 06:28.910
So that's why this distributed bit mask is very important.

06:29.030 --> 06:35.200
It converts and factorial type solutions and to do this to the power and solutions, right?

06:35.600 --> 06:36.920
So we'll see in the next part, everything.
