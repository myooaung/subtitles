00:00.760 --> 00:01.450
Hello, everyone.

00:01.480 --> 00:07.810
So next move on to the next problem, which is longest bot and again, a very classical problem.

00:07.990 --> 00:14.770
It will help you solve a lot of problems on dynamic programming or increase dynamic programming on graphs.

00:15.310 --> 00:15.970
A lot of it.

00:17.080 --> 00:18.130
Let's understand this.

00:18.580 --> 00:21.310
These are directory graph, dividend vertices and images.

00:21.310 --> 00:29.090
Grid vertices are numbered one two in and for each i.e. the Iot edge goes from vertex X8 to y.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.890
A g does not contain any directory cycles full.

00:33.310 --> 00:36.520
So it's really mentioned that it's basically graph.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.140
So basically we call this graph.

00:40.010 --> 00:40.430
Dig.

00:43.530 --> 00:44.310
What's their deck?

00:44.340 --> 00:45.360
It is a dedicated.

00:47.770 --> 00:48.640
It's a click.

00:53.200 --> 00:56.340
Hey, we all know about this and we all have read about this.

00:56.350 --> 00:57.910
We have we all have used it.

00:57.910 --> 01:01.570
We apply topological sorting in all these types of graphs.

01:02.110 --> 01:08.470
State So yeah, so what we have defined is finally in the longest detected part in G, length of the

01:08.470 --> 01:15.430
longest detected, but it contains a cycle that the length of the longest, the body's infinite because

01:15.430 --> 01:17.980
we can always go in the cycle forever.

01:18.610 --> 01:23.290
So that's why he has said that it does not contain any cycles.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.070
So here the consolidated part is the number of edges in it.

01:27.670 --> 01:31.090
So the length of their detected by this number of edges in it and not the nodes.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.010
So let's take an example.

01:34.110 --> 01:34.220
Yeah.

01:34.350 --> 01:37.200
So it's already represented.

01:37.670 --> 01:39.560
So here we have four nodes and 5G.

01:39.570 --> 01:44.610
The first is from 1 to 2, one, two, three, three to 2 to 4 and 3 to 4.

01:44.610 --> 01:46.290
And we can easily see that data.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.610
There are no second in this.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.010
Right?

01:48.720 --> 01:52.830
Of course, it can be a little confusing that there are cycles, but there are no cycles.

01:53.370 --> 01:56.550
If you start from any node, you cannot come back to that node.

01:57.380 --> 01:57.650
They?

01:59.080 --> 02:01.480
It was the end of the longest directed bad guys.

02:01.480 --> 02:08.620
It is from one, two, three, 3 to 2 and 2 to 4 rate of land three because it contains three edges,

02:09.040 --> 02:12.340
although it contains four no trade, which is one, three, two and four.

02:12.580 --> 02:13.570
But here we talk.

02:13.570 --> 02:14.440
We are talking about.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.060
The number of veggies in it.

02:18.920 --> 02:19.220
Great.

02:20.060 --> 02:23.090
So let's talk about let's talk about a leaf node.

02:23.120 --> 02:23.930
Where does that leave node?

02:24.440 --> 02:25.550
It doesn't have any type.

02:25.850 --> 02:31.190
So in our directory cycling graph, there will be at least one leaf node.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.440
I hope you're clear on this.

02:33.710 --> 02:35.330
There will be at least one leaf node on it.

02:36.110 --> 02:38.750
And there will be at at least one.

02:40.800 --> 02:45.780
Also note Ray, which does not have any incoming edges, is just the opposite of the leaf note.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.730
So what we call them, we call them source n sync, right?

02:49.740 --> 02:54.630
So they will be at least one sync and there will be at least one source in a directed acyclic graph.

02:55.480 --> 02:55.740
Right.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.840
So let's talk about the single node, guys.

02:59.070 --> 02:59.730
Yeah, it's.

03:01.870 --> 03:03.580
Take another example.

03:04.720 --> 03:04.930
Okay.

03:04.930 --> 03:06.100
Let's take this example only.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.720
Let me take an example.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.740
Well, it's a wonder to.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.380
Two, two, three, three, two, four.

03:14.250 --> 03:14.760
And.

03:16.680 --> 03:17.430
Let's do this.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.630
It's beautiful.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.430
So what I have is.

03:20.430 --> 03:21.030
I have.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.720
Our director is actually graph grade and I'm talking about the last note.

03:26.900 --> 03:30.380
So what is the length of the longest common subsequent?

03:30.470 --> 03:32.480
Starting from 48.

03:32.490 --> 03:40.520
So that's what will be adequate in relation to F of I will be lent off.

03:42.070 --> 03:44.990
I think these are the states land of the longest.

03:51.510 --> 03:51.940
Addicted.

03:56.210 --> 03:56.990
Starting.

04:01.090 --> 04:02.530
We must start from my.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.960
What are you the length of the longest director group.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.340
So it will be zero in this case.

04:07.850 --> 04:10.440
So this is how we approach anything.

04:10.440 --> 04:11.310
We program the solution.

04:11.310 --> 04:16.880
We start from the base case, then we move upwards by filling all the other values by the reconciliation

04:16.880 --> 04:17.300
that we have.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.260
The right here is the base case for you, right?

04:20.930 --> 04:26.810
The base case is actually the leaf node and the end of the longest common, the length of the longest

04:26.810 --> 04:29.510
directed part starting from the leaf note is zero.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.270
It should be very clear because it doesn't contain any.

04:32.270 --> 04:33.250
It's great.

04:33.950 --> 04:35.990
Now, guys, let's talk about tree.

04:37.320 --> 04:37.590
Well.

04:38.100 --> 04:41.030
So how do we how do we calculate the longest comment?

04:41.250 --> 04:41.910
The longest?

04:43.160 --> 04:44.690
How do we get the answer for three?

04:45.400 --> 04:46.430
It should be very simple.

04:47.540 --> 04:52.910
It should be very simple that from three, I can go to all the trial notes.

04:53.180 --> 04:54.650
It has eight of them.

04:54.650 --> 04:55.550
Any note letter?

04:55.550 --> 04:56.720
This is the current note.

04:57.170 --> 04:58.910
I can go to any of its style notes.

05:00.740 --> 05:01.760
It's a child one.

05:02.860 --> 05:03.460
I do.

05:05.840 --> 05:06.650
Child three.

05:08.140 --> 05:08.680
And so on.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.450
So what will be the length of the longest fog that starts from current?

05:14.910 --> 05:22.560
If I'm starting from a current node, it can be appending appended to the to the longest path at the

05:22.560 --> 05:26.430
prompt L1 or from child to or from territory.

05:27.180 --> 05:34.310
I'd simply say that give me F of zone one, which is the length of the longest by starting from child

05:34.320 --> 05:35.550
one f of change to.

05:38.180 --> 05:39.170
And if after three.

05:41.350 --> 05:43.810
Give me all this free value, then simply take max of them.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.270
And I won't do it.

05:48.450 --> 05:48.930
Why am.

05:49.020 --> 05:50.190
Why am I adding one to it?

05:51.120 --> 05:54.790
Because I'm including this age that this is this age or this.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.420
There is at least one which is being included.

05:58.360 --> 05:58.840
Hey, guys.

06:00.080 --> 06:00.380
So.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.030
So that's the normal of religion.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.390
We don't have to think anything about it or any note.

06:07.390 --> 06:12.190
I just have to find over the length of the note what is the length of the but just starting from one

06:12.190 --> 06:14.500
over two silence and simply append one to it.

06:14.500 --> 06:19.360
Because we are including the edits, we are adding the current note in the longest but eight.

06:19.570 --> 06:21.880
And what we'll do is we'll do this for all the notes.

06:22.300 --> 06:29.740
Okay so that's how recursion but right let's say if I call the first one right, then it will first

06:29.740 --> 06:36.400
call DFS to the answer for two will be calculated and return back to one eight.

06:36.520 --> 06:43.030
So I don't have to worry about filling up leave notes first, then moving up by because that's that's

06:43.090 --> 06:45.220
what the equation is handling for me.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.130
It's only doing this for me.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.010
Okay, what is this stuff that it is doing for me?

06:51.010 --> 06:58.060
It is already going on to the change notes of any note, plus calculating their answer and then return

06:58.170 --> 06:58.360
back.

06:59.500 --> 07:05.590
So I don't have to worry about applying a topological sort in this and then calculating answers in the

07:05.590 --> 07:06.010
order.

07:06.010 --> 07:09.190
We know that's what the equation is doing for me.

07:10.490 --> 07:10.790
Eight.

07:12.700 --> 07:13.810
Very easily escorted out?

07:13.810 --> 07:14.020
No.

07:16.380 --> 07:21.360
I don't think that there should be any of their doubts in this because it's a very easy in we just worried

07:21.360 --> 07:23.730
about one transition what will the final answer.

07:23.880 --> 07:30.270
It will be the maximum of F of current for everyone so it will be maximum of a phase I from one to n

07:30.990 --> 07:33.040
max off phase eight.

07:33.060 --> 07:35.480
So I'm starting from any one particular node.

07:35.520 --> 07:40.920
What are the what is the maximum length of the longest electrified but starting from that.

07:41.840 --> 07:42.110
Look.

07:43.420 --> 07:43.690
These.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.210
Oh, well.

07:47.930 --> 07:51.200
Well, every deep problem is kind of a graph problem.

07:51.200 --> 07:51.770
Only if.

07:51.770 --> 07:54.060
If if it's being offered in that way.

07:54.060 --> 07:54.250
Right.

07:54.320 --> 07:59.660
It's kind of like this is a graph state which is dependent on disease states.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.910
And it's very simple as that.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.550
And the previous problem that we saw here.

08:04.590 --> 08:13.640
Right here what we had we can make a graph of it would aid that f of a comedy is depended on f i minus

08:13.640 --> 08:14.150
one g.

08:16.460 --> 08:19.460
Or if I go gym minus one or.

08:21.650 --> 08:22.790
I might as well listen.

08:22.790 --> 08:23.160
Plasma.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.070
Isn't this a graph?

08:25.370 --> 08:27.500
Isn't this a directed acyclic graph?

08:28.310 --> 08:31.610
Isn't this more.

08:31.850 --> 08:32.200
Okay.

08:33.470 --> 08:33.730
Okay.

08:34.220 --> 08:36.980
Isn't this what we are doing from a very long time?

08:38.500 --> 08:39.330
Let me refresher.

08:45.100 --> 08:45.460
Okay.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.390
There's some error.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.890
Oh, let's ignore that.

08:48.180 --> 08:51.420
Hey, isn't this what we're doing from the first problem itself?

08:51.730 --> 08:56.950
We're kind of creating a directory, basically graph by considering the nodes as the street values and

08:56.950 --> 09:02.860
then making the edges where the edges edges are that recursive relations that transitions their dependent

09:02.860 --> 09:03.220
state.

09:04.030 --> 09:04.330
Eight.

09:05.370 --> 09:09.030
So in the next problem, we'll call this out and see in the next part.
