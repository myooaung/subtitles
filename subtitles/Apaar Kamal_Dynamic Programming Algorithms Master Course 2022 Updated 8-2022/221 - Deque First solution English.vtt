WEBVTT

00:00.770 --> 00:01.490
And everyone.

00:01.580 --> 00:05.930
So let's move on to the next problem, which is the Q and.

00:07.350 --> 00:10.400
By doing this problem, articulate will understand.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.600
Let me explain this.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.300
So I'll be solving this problem in two parts.

00:15.020 --> 00:21.230
This is kind of according to me that one of the most confusing problems in ordinary programming, of

00:21.230 --> 00:23.690
course, in this tutorial series.

00:24.110 --> 00:31.280
So to avoid that confusion, we will try and solve this problem by taking two different solutions.

00:31.480 --> 00:35.210
We will have two different, different solutions of solving this problem.

00:35.820 --> 00:40.640
Eight will solve this problem using two different dynamic programming approaches.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.080
So what we'll do is we'll have a couple of.

00:46.210 --> 00:51.730
BP states, they too will have our be something, we'll be representing something, and then we'll have

00:51.730 --> 00:57.520
another deep state which will bring in something else and we'll see how both the solutions work.

00:58.060 --> 01:02.890
It means how there are different approaches to solve the same problem.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.130
Will this positivity rate solve it?

01:06.130 --> 01:07.630
And then we'll move forward.

01:09.780 --> 01:14.810
The problem statement is that Thoreau and Jiro will play the following game against each other.

01:15.350 --> 01:17.960
Initially, they are given a sequence until.

01:19.900 --> 01:25.150
Of course, we have an area which has a land of 3000 until it becomes empty.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.100
The two police perform the following operation.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.680
Alternatively eight starting from tomorrow.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.250
So tomorrow is the facility.

01:31.330 --> 01:38.560
And then Jesus apparently removed the element at the beginning, ordered the end of the player.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.710
Owens explains their excuse to remove the element.

01:42.650 --> 01:47.360
So that means I have an ATM at the picking element from the front or the end.

01:47.480 --> 01:52.310
And when that element is removed, the RSA strings shrinks by eight.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.650
So the NSA uses has been reduced by one.

01:54.650 --> 01:59.060
So I am picking an element from first or the last and I have the remaining at it.

01:59.060 --> 02:02.380
And then the other operations are being performed on the remaining area.

02:03.110 --> 02:06.710
Once an element removed, it is removed completely, permanently.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.530
I won't be removing any element again.

02:11.960 --> 02:16.910
Assuming that the two players play optimally, find the resulting value of x minus.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.920
But oops, I missed the statement.

02:19.670 --> 02:22.220
Let X and y be throwing zeros.

02:22.220 --> 02:23.960
Total score at the end of the game.

02:24.410 --> 02:25.430
What is happening?

02:25.430 --> 02:27.600
They are picking elements one by one.

02:27.620 --> 02:28.430
Alternatively.

02:28.820 --> 02:29.870
And these are the.

02:31.150 --> 02:34.900
This is a total score at the end of the game for tomorrow.

02:34.900 --> 02:43.510
And why would you characterize to maximize X minus weight by 0120 tries to minimize x minus way.

02:43.810 --> 02:49.630
Basically, Thorne's daughter wants to maximize the x minus way and zero tries to minimize X minus five.

02:49.630 --> 02:55.810
So just assuming the duplicates fully, optimally, find the results resulting value of x minus five.

02:56.820 --> 02:57.000
So.

02:58.770 --> 03:00.630
Of course, kind of a little tricky problem.

03:00.630 --> 03:04.620
But yes, let's start with the examples and then we will solve it with different, different ways.

03:05.010 --> 03:05.240
A.

03:06.910 --> 03:07.180
Yeah.

03:07.180 --> 03:10.270
So the first example is this NATO 1930.

03:10.780 --> 03:11.380
Let me.

03:12.290 --> 03:12.950
That's what I did.

03:15.780 --> 03:20.250
Or do we have we have an 8090.

03:21.100 --> 03:21.490
30.

03:23.930 --> 03:27.470
So it's not Ocean's Eight and this is the attic.

03:28.220 --> 03:30.260
What can you do to throw us two options?

03:30.440 --> 03:33.590
Either he can pick up the first element from the area and that is ten.

03:34.460 --> 03:35.900
Let's say he picks up ten.

03:36.260 --> 03:36.530
Eight.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.980
So if he picks up ten, so it is ten plus what?

03:40.860 --> 03:42.180
Not plus three.

03:42.350 --> 03:43.790
So let's not eight plus or minus.

03:44.420 --> 03:46.760
Let's just understand what the problem is.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.610
So Justin and then it being 1930 ordered this.

03:54.820 --> 03:57.550
He picks up three from then and the remaining eddies.

03:58.540 --> 04:00.010
It being 90.

04:01.020 --> 04:04.800
Eight afterwards means these are two different ways you can do both.

04:05.730 --> 04:06.330
The next is.

04:07.390 --> 04:14.440
From this note, this second place, languages, gyro or gyro or whatever it is, he picks up 80, and

04:14.440 --> 04:15.820
now the remaining at it is.

04:17.400 --> 04:22.170
1930, 1930 as always, except 30.

04:22.170 --> 04:26.580
Then it is 80 or 90, and again it will be that Ocean's Eight.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.340
Look, whenever I tried to do, I tried to solve it.

04:32.340 --> 04:36.840
Any programming problem, I try to start with the minimum cases as possible.

04:36.840 --> 04:39.390
A case for one, case for two, case for three.

04:39.390 --> 04:40.710
Then and then see that.

04:40.710 --> 04:41.970
How are the things building up?

04:42.330 --> 04:45.060
And then I'm able to write a whole recursive solution.

04:45.420 --> 04:45.640
They.

04:47.760 --> 04:51.330
So again, if he took the stand and it is 1890.

04:52.510 --> 04:55.270
And he chooses 90, then it is anti-rape.

04:55.810 --> 05:02.470
And similarly, guys, we can choose anyone from these couples and the other one will be chosen by the

05:02.470 --> 05:02.980
next player.

05:03.490 --> 05:03.720
Eight.

05:04.030 --> 05:09.880
The total score for tomorrow will be X and the total score for Jairo will be white.

05:09.880 --> 05:10.330
And.

05:12.950 --> 05:18.460
Wants to maximize x minus y while giro wants to minimize x minus eight.

05:20.570 --> 05:25.820
This is kind of a different way of saying the main purpose of this problem.

05:27.320 --> 05:36.290
If Tara wants to maximize X minus Y, the insert can say that he wants to maximize X and minimize the

05:36.290 --> 05:38.020
way to think about it.

05:38.510 --> 05:44.030
If he wants to maximize X minus y eight, that means he wants to maximize x.

05:44.030 --> 05:49.760
That means as much as possible, while at the same time trying to minimize way.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.450
Eight similarly days for Giro.

05:53.450 --> 05:58.070
If Giro wants to minimise x minus y then.

05:59.670 --> 06:06.240
Can we say that Gyro wants to maximize weight and minimize x, then only x minus y will be minimized.

06:06.930 --> 06:07.170
Eight.

06:07.860 --> 06:12.810
So it's kind of a different way of seeing it that they want their scores to be maximum possible.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.810
So basically what I mean to say is the group wants to.

06:17.730 --> 06:18.930
Wants to maximize.

06:20.490 --> 06:22.590
X by giro wants to.

06:23.830 --> 06:24.850
Also maximize.

06:28.070 --> 06:32.240
But kind of both of them are trying to maximize their own schools.

06:32.510 --> 06:32.810
Right.

06:33.980 --> 06:38.030
Not always trying to maximize x y gyros, trying to maximize y.

06:38.210 --> 06:39.110
I hope you got this.

06:39.140 --> 06:39.920
Now, let's see.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.350
Let's see if Tara wants to maximize X.

06:42.980 --> 06:45.320
Why would he want to minimize Y?

06:45.710 --> 06:47.000
It's not needed there.

06:47.510 --> 06:48.410
Misunderstand misunderstandings.

06:48.950 --> 06:49.440
Let's see.

06:50.090 --> 06:50.540
We know.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.490
What will be expressways expressway in the end.

06:55.370 --> 06:59.870
Everyone is speaking an element at the from the first order then and then what will happen?

06:59.870 --> 07:01.140
The error will become empty.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.510
All the elements have been picked up.

07:02.990 --> 07:06.240
All the elements will be either picked by Taro or Jado.

07:06.260 --> 07:10.720
That means explosives should be equal to sum of all the values of the edit.

07:11.150 --> 07:12.710
I hope you got this straight.

07:12.950 --> 07:13.820
What does this mean?

07:13.940 --> 07:15.830
Is that expert advice constant?

07:16.950 --> 07:20.220
Because some of the values of the is constant hate.

07:21.150 --> 07:22.020
So if.

07:22.890 --> 07:23.640
So what is?

07:24.480 --> 07:24.750
Yeah.

07:24.930 --> 07:32.460
So if X plus y is constant, that means if I if God is trying to maximize x, that means y will automatically

07:32.460 --> 07:33.330
be minimum possible.

07:33.330 --> 07:33.560
Right.

07:33.570 --> 07:36.840
Because explains why is constant h.

07:38.690 --> 07:39.860
I do.

07:40.160 --> 07:40.460
Okay.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.660
Let me give you another example.

07:41.660 --> 07:45.190
Let's let's talk about X and do it X into it.

07:45.350 --> 07:47.040
And I enter texting device constant.

07:47.300 --> 07:51.680
I'm trying to maximize x stop by will automatically be minimum possible, right.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.500
Because X and y is a constant value.

07:54.980 --> 07:57.410
Eight Similarly, let's talk about x plus five.

07:57.410 --> 08:03.810
I try if I want to be makes impossible y will automatically decrease because constant minus x will be

08:04.100 --> 08:05.590
minimum possible eight.

08:05.660 --> 08:12.650
So there is like there's no need of saying especially that if data is trying to maximize x then through

08:12.650 --> 08:17.540
is also trying to minimize by similarly zero, always trying to maximize y.

08:17.930 --> 08:21.350
Then Jairo is also trying to minimize X.

08:21.350 --> 08:23.570
There's no need of seeing it spatially.

08:24.440 --> 08:28.970
What we can say is that both of them are trying to maximize their own scores.

08:29.840 --> 08:30.140
Right?

08:30.500 --> 08:34.520
So these are so convincing, these things that look me.

08:35.300 --> 08:35.630
Right.

08:35.690 --> 08:39.410
The thought is trying to maximize X by gyro is trying to.

08:41.410 --> 08:49.330
Minimize X by because if gyro is trying to maximize right, that means automatically is trying to minimize

08:49.330 --> 08:49.540
x.

08:49.540 --> 08:52.090
As I've already given you this example of a constant value.

08:52.780 --> 08:58.060
If she's trying to maximize it, by that means she's trying to minimize x she or he.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.250
I don't know because these are Japanese name.

09:00.250 --> 09:02.680
I think so forgive me for that.

09:03.040 --> 09:09.190
But yes, if I was trying to maximize y that means that is trying to minimize x.

09:09.460 --> 09:16.620
But from this conclusion and by using this statement, I have come and learned to do that.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.900
He's trying to maximize X.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.210
Well, just trying to minimize.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.930
Now both of them are trying to do something on X.

09:24.300 --> 09:30.330
Now there are no two variables about y ray and no two variables X and Y.

09:30.330 --> 09:34.620
And now we have both the variables, physics, the theories, trying to maximize X injuries, trying

09:34.620 --> 09:36.400
to minimize the x eight.

09:36.630 --> 09:43.400
So now let's play this game with the statement saying that through whatever topics, let's consider

09:43.400 --> 09:45.980
considered X and that is trying to maximize it.

09:45.990 --> 09:47.820
Well, that is saying to minimize its state.

09:48.240 --> 09:54.870
So basically our problem statement which said that paraphrase to maximize X minus Y and zero tries to

09:54.870 --> 10:01.140
minimize the x minus way I reduce the to this problem statement iteration to maximize x and gyration

10:01.140 --> 10:03.020
to minimize x eight.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.050
Now let's make a deep, deep state.

10:06.830 --> 10:07.760
So let's say deep.

10:08.780 --> 10:10.010
Let's talk about indexes.

10:10.490 --> 10:10.860
Okay.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.350
This is the remaining at it.

10:12.350 --> 10:17.330
And we all know that there will be a continuous or very wide because we have picking element from at

10:17.330 --> 10:22.670
the front or from the end always that it will be a continuous a very on which the game can be played.

10:23.410 --> 10:30.680
Let's say they be a two day and let's say who whomsoever is done.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.230
It is like certain state.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.420
So this is a normal strategy visit.

10:37.420 --> 10:42.280
And that is that from the from the remaining area, which is from a 2G.

10:43.700 --> 10:48.140
And the remaining elements which are left to be played on from this area.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.690
Give maximum.

10:58.570 --> 10:59.620
X scored.

11:03.520 --> 11:08.710
But now what's the thing that we got that if it startles chance he's trying to maximize this but it's

11:08.740 --> 11:11.950
zero chance he seems to minimize extended ended.

11:12.650 --> 11:15.280
Hey so what happens now?

11:15.290 --> 11:21.040
We have two dents playing year eight so if it is Taurus Johnson it's it's my Johnson I'm I have to pick

11:21.040 --> 11:24.070
to element eight so let's see if I'm picking element.

11:25.550 --> 11:29.390
Or I can pick e j element and it's not oceans.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.450
Let me write it over here about Ocean's Eight.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.630
So what happens, guys?

11:36.410 --> 11:40.520
Let me say that if done is zero, then it is for.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.490
And if anything goes to one.

11:48.180 --> 11:49.320
Then it is zero.

11:50.930 --> 11:51.950
Let's not worry about that.

11:53.090 --> 11:58.010
So right now, let's just throw stones and Wynton is it goes to zero and this is the remaining area

11:58.940 --> 12:04.360
Detroit's to borrow has two options either pick a or pick it.

12:04.830 --> 12:04.990
Right.

12:05.060 --> 12:09.590
So if the group picks up A, that means what is the remaining Eddie left?

12:09.590 --> 12:10.480
Which is it?

12:10.490 --> 12:13.550
Be a less one, two days left.

12:13.550 --> 12:14.510
And what is that done?

12:14.520 --> 12:17.860
It's the next place and which is dataset eight.

12:18.080 --> 12:25.430
So this is the next ID and if he picks up AJ, that means I will be as it isn't, I will be reduced

12:25.430 --> 12:29.270
to minus one and it will be the next place to eight he picks.

12:29.390 --> 12:35.360
If he picks up eight, that means AA should be included in my x because what is the D returning?

12:37.160 --> 12:38.420
The dip is in.

12:38.630 --> 12:41.090
This is returning with a maximum value of.

12:42.900 --> 12:45.660
X if it is first.

12:45.900 --> 12:46.190
Right.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.070
So basically.

12:49.270 --> 12:49.650
Okay.

12:49.660 --> 12:51.640
Let me give a little space here.

13:03.230 --> 13:08.990
They brought a deep idea in turn means let me easily like comfortably write it first.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.630
It means that if it is Tahitians.

13:12.800 --> 13:17.630
If it is Tahitians, then he's maximizing eggs that return me.

13:19.960 --> 13:20.920
Maximum.

13:23.510 --> 13:25.850
Value of X.

13:27.540 --> 13:31.230
If aeroplane made a device.

13:32.190 --> 13:34.070
That means if done is one of the ways.

13:34.140 --> 13:34.830
Return me.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.080
Minimum.

13:38.990 --> 13:39.620
Value.

13:40.470 --> 13:46.830
Of x x do remember we are only talking about x not why not x minus why not explains why only eggs.

13:47.850 --> 13:50.010
But it didn't meet the minimum value of eggs if.

13:51.220 --> 13:52.430
It's De Rothschild.

13:52.440 --> 13:56.170
So basically whosever chance it is, they're trying to perform their.

13:58.560 --> 14:04.850
You know they're trying to have what they want eight at the maximizing so minimize X depending on the

14:05.390 --> 14:05.870
chance.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.880
Well, this is a normally B state.

14:09.130 --> 14:09.370
Yeah.

14:09.580 --> 14:15.730
So if it is Thoreau's genes, that means he's trying to maximize this X So it is A-plus either.

14:15.770 --> 14:24.250
DP So what I would do, whatever the maximum X value is being returned eight or whatever the x value

14:24.250 --> 14:28.230
is being returned from the next player to us from the remaining Eddie.

14:28.630 --> 14:30.640
What it'll do is he has to simply added.

14:31.840 --> 14:37.300
So of course guys in the next player's ton, which is Jairus, don't you try to minimize X rate, but

14:37.300 --> 14:38.410
we don't have to worry about that.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.860
Whatever he returns to me I want this to be makes impossible.

14:42.460 --> 14:43.870
Otherwise, what's the second option?

14:45.010 --> 14:49.360
In zipless whatever zero returns me any meaning really of sex.

14:49.740 --> 14:53.740
Well so this was about Taurus chance and okay he picks up a.

14:54.520 --> 14:59.530
And as from the remaining area, what is the x that can be formed?

14:59.530 --> 15:01.120
And he'll simply add it ended on impact.

15:01.580 --> 15:08.680
Otherwise if it is or it's a second video and he picks up it in us and done the things back to us.

15:09.310 --> 15:11.110
Now these are let's talk about J2.

15:12.180 --> 15:12.480
Right.

15:12.810 --> 15:16.410
But what will talk to whatever he gets from both these elements?

15:17.490 --> 15:18.720
From these values.

15:18.720 --> 15:23.400
He'll simply take max of these values because he has started in the max impossible value of X.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.410
But what will gyro do this?

15:26.220 --> 15:30.720
If I have an additive meaning from AI to G, what will gyro try to do?

15:30.840 --> 15:36.960
As already mentioned, gyro will try to minimize x and we found it outright is trying to minimize it.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.730
So what happens?

15:42.610 --> 15:43.000
Again.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.220
Jairo can pick the day.

15:45.370 --> 15:49.180
I can pick AJ toward the remaining area.

15:49.270 --> 15:50.800
So we have the same state kind of.

15:51.370 --> 15:55.750
That is DP A-plus one day and it will be 0 seconds.

15:56.350 --> 15:57.790
There is not a chance.

15:57.790 --> 16:05.320
Otherwise it will be db accommodate minus one and it will again be zero satisfied whatever the maximum

16:05.680 --> 16:07.120
values of x.

16:08.280 --> 16:15.480
I'm getting from both these values, whatever I'm getting c c by not adding E or adding this case because

16:15.480 --> 16:16.500
it's dilutions.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.860
And I'm only talking about the maximum value of X in my state.

16:20.730 --> 16:25.030
I'm talking only about the maximum value of X over this dilutions.

16:25.650 --> 16:29.760
Zero will not add A0 reading x because what does do we need to return?

16:29.760 --> 16:35.730
Do we need to return only the x values that Tara has picked not zero has picked eight, but whatever

16:35.730 --> 16:38.100
is the maximum value that.

16:39.500 --> 16:44.990
I'm getting from A-plus Wendy or a comedy minus one so little.

16:44.990 --> 16:47.690
I'm getting some value from this and some value from this.

16:47.690 --> 16:50.750
So what should be the best for Jairo to do that?

16:50.780 --> 16:54.110
I will try to minimize this value because that's what she's trying to do.

16:54.110 --> 16:54.410
Right.

16:54.770 --> 17:03.230
What will you do is she'll try to minimize whatever the two maximums that can be formed by that date

17:03.470 --> 17:09.620
before the next stage that is off from a plus one to or from a to do minus one, whatever the remaining

17:09.800 --> 17:14.000
is out of both these areas, Jairo is saying, okay, give me the maximum value.

17:14.660 --> 17:20.720
Okay, Darvish, I try to form this maximum value or this maximum value, but what I'll do is I'll try

17:20.720 --> 17:21.590
to minimize it.

17:22.400 --> 17:27.470
How is you minimize the tricks out of the maximum that you've got from the remaining at is still there

17:27.470 --> 17:35.180
to minimize you take the minimum and again, because that's the best path for her so that X is minimized.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.990
The early data to try to minimize the new meaning.

17:39.230 --> 17:44.240
But wait, so this was the normal thing about this problem?

17:44.240 --> 17:48.830
Of course, guys, it can be a little tricky because new players are playing when once to do something

17:48.830 --> 17:49.060
else.

17:49.070 --> 17:50.270
It can once you do something else.

17:51.650 --> 17:53.060
So let's call it.

17:53.060 --> 17:54.800
And in the next tutorial we'll also.

17:56.590 --> 18:01.680
Record this problem in a second we will try to make a different episode and solve it.

18:02.110 --> 18:03.670
So I know it's kind of a brute force.

18:03.670 --> 18:04.390
DP Basically.

18:05.560 --> 18:06.970
So yeah.

18:12.290 --> 18:13.310
Let's understand this.

18:14.670 --> 18:16.200
Copy this, Mr. Dear.

18:24.620 --> 18:25.410
This is the.

18:28.980 --> 18:31.890
Let's write a brute force solution to a layer.

18:31.890 --> 18:33.430
What we have is and is 2000.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.100
Let's take a.

18:37.570 --> 18:38.410
Two, three.

18:42.220 --> 18:42.800
3000.

18:44.880 --> 18:45.300
And.

18:46.450 --> 18:47.770
Let's take an.

18:48.890 --> 18:50.510
Also Dick and Eddie.

18:53.050 --> 18:54.100
Think the input.

18:59.130 --> 18:59.450
Good.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.620
Not not a big issue till now.

19:04.150 --> 19:06.240
So I've taken the input of taking this whole Eddie.

19:06.670 --> 19:06.920
So.

19:08.030 --> 19:10.160
What is the maximum exit I can get?

19:10.190 --> 19:11.690
Let's write Max X.

19:12.170 --> 19:12.500
There it is.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.330
What do you mean?

19:13.340 --> 19:14.540
It needs to return me.

19:14.840 --> 19:15.560
It did give me.

19:15.560 --> 19:20.570
What is the maximum x if initially thought of is starting the game.

19:21.130 --> 19:22.960
So give me the max who makes full.

19:23.060 --> 19:23.990
So what will be Max?

19:23.990 --> 19:24.530
Vegas.

19:29.340 --> 19:33.570
What will be a max VI or let's see if I've got this max x.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.190
What will be the Max VI?

19:35.190 --> 19:35.970
That is possible.

19:36.300 --> 19:36.870
It will be.

19:38.390 --> 19:40.460
The total sum of the area minus.

19:42.380 --> 19:44.690
Mexico's fate today will be not, Max.

19:44.900 --> 19:49.790
It will be the minimum by possible, because that's what he's trying to do and he's the first player

19:49.790 --> 19:50.930
to play it.

19:51.050 --> 19:59.210
So basically, minimum buy is what part of what I got from this dip, which is Mexico minus some minus.

20:01.640 --> 20:01.860
Eight.

20:02.450 --> 20:04.530
This is what we decided over here eight.

20:04.550 --> 20:10.610
When I explored where I was constantly trying to maximize survival or dramatically reduce you.

20:11.330 --> 20:12.050
So how to take.

20:12.210 --> 20:13.520
So let's take the some of the area.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.470
I think you should not have a problem with this.

20:17.470 --> 20:18.640
What is Mexican mean?

20:19.790 --> 20:21.520
That's what I was trying to do.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.380
So that's what.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.050
Attrition rate.

20:26.140 --> 20:26.680
So what?

20:26.680 --> 20:28.000
We'll finally print.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.530
We have to print.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.170
What we need to.

20:32.950 --> 20:36.610
Let me check as we need to place we optimally find that the value of x minus way.

20:36.790 --> 20:37.630
So it will be simple.

20:37.630 --> 20:38.080
Nothing.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.100
It's just x minus.

20:43.230 --> 20:46.400
Good luck because right now we are starting from the first place.

20:46.400 --> 20:52.620
So it's about first place point of view that what is the maximum x you can get if first place starting

20:52.620 --> 20:52.730
it?

20:53.780 --> 20:54.030
Cool.

20:54.380 --> 21:00.080
So let's write some deep function which we have already declared defined, and we'll have the term value

21:00.080 --> 21:01.560
here, which is good.

21:02.210 --> 21:02.440
Okay.

21:03.620 --> 21:04.070
Finally.

21:04.320 --> 21:04.630
Okay.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.190
So what should be the answer that needs to be done to come?

21:07.260 --> 21:08.210
You depends on done.

21:08.670 --> 21:11.570
What is Taurus done that means to anything close to zero?

21:11.580 --> 21:14.180
Because zero is for taro and gyro or gyro.

21:14.180 --> 21:17.900
We have 183, just Tara's stones.

21:17.900 --> 21:20.210
What happens is it's the answer.

21:22.110 --> 21:25.230
Eight to answer is equal to a maximum of.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.450
The things that we have declared.

21:28.610 --> 21:36.350
There is every guarantee aa and ask for the remaining values of AI plus one to d.

21:37.290 --> 21:41.370
Or he can take the jeered value and ask for the remaining values.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.250
As for the maximum that is possible from the.

21:46.070 --> 21:53.240
Other player when it starts to play at 8 to 10 will be equal to, okay, let's say one minus ten.

21:54.570 --> 21:55.860
Why am I doing one minus ten?

21:55.860 --> 21:59.850
Because if done in zero, then the next one will be one.

21:59.850 --> 22:02.490
Otherwise, if done is one, then the next one will be zero.

22:03.180 --> 22:03.420
Well.

22:04.540 --> 22:08.770
So here I have the second option, which is from the remaining array, which is left from the remaining

22:08.770 --> 22:09.520
game, which is clear.

22:09.970 --> 22:10.540
Give me.

22:11.560 --> 22:12.100
The next.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.230
Give me the best possible gun.

22:15.290 --> 22:20.340
And out of all what these values guys are talking it in the maximum possible answer.

22:20.340 --> 22:20.620
Right.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.090
So here lets me return the answer.

22:24.110 --> 22:24.350
Well.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.970
And what if it's DeRozan guys?

22:28.190 --> 22:28.780
Oh, sorry.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.880
What if it's DeRozan?

22:31.270 --> 22:32.650
What will Jairo do if it's.

22:33.990 --> 22:34.620
They're done.

22:37.890 --> 22:38.790
His answer for her.

22:39.730 --> 22:40.570
It will be simple.

22:42.740 --> 22:49.490
Whatever the maximal use of X are possible from the remaining areas, whatever the answer is possible

22:49.490 --> 22:50.420
for the remaining areas.

22:50.630 --> 22:55.490
These are done the minimum of them because she wants to minimise x eight.

22:55.910 --> 23:00.710
So he is trying to maximize x and here that is trying to minimize things.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.290
I hope there's no problem with it because.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.890
It's turned abandoned.

23:06.370 --> 23:08.530
So here we are considering alien.

23:08.530 --> 23:08.830
It is.

23:08.830 --> 23:09.430
Here we are not.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.870
Because that's not a part of.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.830
Ex right now.

23:15.570 --> 23:21.270
It's totally dependent on the standards that if I'm taking a State X, then it has to be calculated

23:21.270 --> 23:22.980
on the basis of X, if I'm taking.

23:22.980 --> 23:23.790
Right, of course.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.150
Let's say it's a follow problem for you.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.670
Let's take the state to be.

23:29.670 --> 23:32.640
Why not x the return the maximum value of y.

23:33.390 --> 23:36.780
If zero said if zero ended in the minimum value of Y.

23:36.780 --> 23:37.830
If zero.

23:38.490 --> 23:38.850
Right.

23:39.450 --> 23:44.820
Solving this new problem that I've given you by considering y, you'll understand the difference.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.310
Hey, what is the best case rate?

23:46.330 --> 23:47.610
We have to have a base case.

23:48.150 --> 23:53.190
If all is equal to zero, that means if there's only one particular area left, one particular value

23:53.190 --> 23:54.150
left, then what?

23:54.150 --> 23:57.000
I need to return this little rendered value.

23:57.390 --> 24:05.100
Okay, so again, yeah, I in their value way because let's say it is dilutions then that the value

24:05.100 --> 24:10.080
should not be returned because d b represents x not one zero.

24:10.090 --> 24:11.330
Because it's not true.

24:11.420 --> 24:14.250
Because what I can do is.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.160
Okay, so let's make a bigger case.

24:17.190 --> 24:21.500
Let's say if I use greater than do, that means I enjoy coming close.

24:21.510 --> 24:22.580
That is empty.

24:22.590 --> 24:24.630
That means I was after Z.

24:24.870 --> 24:26.910
So if I use greater than the return.

24:28.640 --> 24:33.290
Zero because there's nothing left and there's nothing to be a big fool.

24:33.590 --> 24:38.120
Otherwise, what I can do is if you are getting confused with this base case, then we can simply say

24:38.120 --> 24:42.680
this If I goes to jail and if it is, that is he goes to zero.

24:42.680 --> 24:47.770
Let's say if done is zero, that means its Ocean's Eight completed.

24:47.780 --> 24:49.370
Anything else?

24:49.370 --> 24:50.000
I alluded.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.650
That's another way of writing your advice, because whenever it's directions.

24:58.570 --> 24:59.050
She can't.

24:59.680 --> 25:02.890
Her contribution doesn't even include an x ray.

25:02.980 --> 25:06.630
So you're going to do whatever what the Naval Academy commented.

25:07.920 --> 25:08.630
And it's really.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.510
It's what we got.

25:11.510 --> 25:11.870
We got.

25:12.230 --> 25:14.090
Then how did we get engaged?

25:14.120 --> 25:14.660
Because.

25:16.220 --> 25:21.170
In the Arabic 70, then the Arabic 1980, and then the Arabic.

25:21.430 --> 25:23.200
And so let me give you this example.

25:23.240 --> 25:27.080
It's a nice one, which is written 110 eight.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.630
What happens is here we have ten.

25:30.050 --> 25:30.740
Here we have ten.

25:30.740 --> 25:34.170
So no matter what topics, Jairo will be considered eight.

25:34.760 --> 25:39.290
So if zero 600, Toro has no option left to pick another ten.

25:39.290 --> 25:41.720
And I will have to be in there.

25:41.720 --> 25:42.110
Will have.

25:43.550 --> 25:48.400
Hundred to the minimum experience by will be 80 -88.

25:49.340 --> 25:52.470
Well, I think that there's no problem with it now.

25:52.920 --> 25:53.790
It's down somewhere.

25:54.810 --> 25:56.910
So I have found out what is it makes in value of eggs.

25:56.910 --> 25:58.980
That is possible liver distortions.

25:59.460 --> 26:04.380
And then I have taken the value of Y, which is partial, which will be called the sum minus maximum

26:04.380 --> 26:07.500
of x and I'm printing x minus eight.

26:09.260 --> 26:10.280
I'm printing it.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.360
What the place optimally?

26:11.360 --> 26:12.740
What is the value of X for?

26:14.200 --> 26:19.460
So this is a brute force base that what each time we are trying to do what they want, knowledge and

26:19.510 --> 26:19.960
music.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.370
So let's memorize it.

26:24.850 --> 26:25.760
And too late.

26:26.140 --> 26:29.830
So here I was, 16 knew that this gun is not needed.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.060
We don't need this.

26:31.060 --> 26:32.620
Don't do in memorization part.

26:32.950 --> 26:33.120
I'll.

26:33.130 --> 26:33.700
I'll explain.

26:33.700 --> 26:35.500
You're smart, buddy.

26:36.220 --> 26:36.750
Let's see.

26:36.760 --> 26:37.220
Memo.

26:37.420 --> 26:38.530
I do.

26:39.970 --> 26:42.880
Well, and maybe you will do it.

26:43.570 --> 26:47.020
Well, normal memorization is not a big deal.

26:47.410 --> 26:48.040
And initially.

26:48.040 --> 26:48.250
What?

26:48.580 --> 26:48.890
Yeah.

26:48.910 --> 26:49.930
And what I have to do is.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.270
If answer is not equal, do so.

26:53.420 --> 26:57.590
We have to give some value to this mammal because we cannot give minus one now.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.070
Why?

26:58.370 --> 27:00.590
Because values can be negative two.

27:01.280 --> 27:05.220
We cannot initially fill it with minus one as a default value and check rate.

27:05.270 --> 27:08.270
And it's film a value which is which cannot be possible.

27:08.870 --> 27:11.450
What I have is we have 3010 to the power name.

27:11.870 --> 27:18.560
So the range goes from 3000 to above us, nine and minus of 2009.

27:18.560 --> 27:19.930
So these many values are possible.

27:19.940 --> 27:25.320
So let's take something very large, which is a 2018 pool.

27:26.060 --> 27:27.920
So let me fill.

27:28.700 --> 27:32.870
Yes, I saw this method of filling the deep values somewhere.

27:32.930 --> 27:34.280
Let me use it once.

27:38.050 --> 27:38.310
Cool.

27:38.530 --> 27:39.730
Let's not use this.

27:41.160 --> 27:45.600
So here, let me go over all the values of the memo and.

27:46.630 --> 27:48.130
Fill them with something.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.110
Which is.

27:51.860 --> 27:52.700
Not possible.

27:58.910 --> 27:59.560
Minus one.

27:59.570 --> 28:00.740
We're doing all we can.

28:00.740 --> 28:03.200
All to do it with money or without them will work.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.930
Well, I'm filling it with a value, which is not possible.

28:06.740 --> 28:08.120
So it's come back.

28:08.330 --> 28:12.500
And if answer is not equal to 2018, then simply return.

28:13.360 --> 28:13.810
Answer.

28:14.700 --> 28:18.240
But otherwise answer will be either this or this.

28:19.320 --> 28:19.730
Place.

28:21.390 --> 28:21.630
Yeah.

28:21.630 --> 28:22.820
I don't see any problem in this.

28:22.830 --> 28:23.520
Let's build it.

28:25.130 --> 28:25.400
Okay.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.080
I'm getting -30 and it's summer.

28:27.110 --> 28:28.550
This using this approach.

28:34.590 --> 28:43.590
I hope you got this that biometric thing x as the DP returning where you raid my memory digging x because

28:43.590 --> 28:45.390
I have generalized.

28:46.360 --> 28:52.420
That from from x minus Y, I have generalized it, but what both data and gyro are trying to do on x

28:53.230 --> 28:53.500
eight.

28:54.960 --> 28:55.200
Cool.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.680
I got an accepted answer.

28:56.760 --> 28:57.720
197 music.

28:57.720 --> 28:58.920
And it's it's good.

28:59.340 --> 29:00.120
No problem at all.

29:00.510 --> 29:06.370
Yes, I was saying that we don't I don't have to actually memorize using this two way, way.

29:07.850 --> 29:10.340
I leave it up to you, but I'll just give you a small hint.

29:11.150 --> 29:11.900
Just tell me.

29:12.940 --> 29:19.630
In me if let's say the air is land distant, and so the remaining air is from 0 to 9 because I'm thinking

29:19.630 --> 29:23.290
zero based indexing, that means I'm talking about this thing zero, two and minus one.

29:24.520 --> 29:28.120
So initially, guys, it will be our oceans only rate.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.310
Zero can not make a movie.

29:30.820 --> 29:34.570
They cannot make a movie that is not necessary.

29:34.710 --> 29:35.050
Right.

29:35.470 --> 29:35.860
Because.

29:37.170 --> 29:38.850
In this part zero nine.

29:38.850 --> 29:39.990
It will always be zero.

29:40.170 --> 29:41.280
It will never be vinyl.

29:42.150 --> 29:43.800
Now, let's talk about 1129.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.170
That means let's talk about the zeroth element.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.700
Now the remaining it is one to name.

29:48.030 --> 29:52.020
So it will it will always be gyro chance and not total chance.

29:54.560 --> 30:02.630
At any point of time at one common name, Del Toro can never make a move because only one element has

30:02.630 --> 30:03.260
been picked up.

30:03.590 --> 30:10.670
It's kind of even our thing that if one element is or three elements aspect of five element big because

30:10.670 --> 30:15.260
they're playing a relatively right number of elements and then it's dilutions.

30:15.710 --> 30:21.920
And if even number of elements it's big 0246 and it is solutions.

30:22.610 --> 30:27.570
What I can say is, okay, now you can derive it yourself, not a big deal.

30:27.590 --> 30:31.310
So I thought of giving a tune, but I explained it.

30:31.760 --> 30:32.330
No problem.

30:33.380 --> 30:34.460
But we don't have to.

30:34.520 --> 30:38.180
We don't need to memorize it on the basis of time.

30:38.420 --> 30:42.890
But of course we need to past and we can also not past.

30:42.890 --> 30:45.830
And by why we cannot paston we can simply.

30:48.360 --> 30:49.500
Derived over a video.

30:50.160 --> 30:57.240
How how can I derived in over a here by simply saying that if even number of elements are picked, that

30:57.240 --> 30:58.560
means it startles chance.

30:59.860 --> 31:02.710
Otherwise, if our number of elements are big, then it is dilution.

31:02.710 --> 31:06.550
So you can also you can easily do that by taking it how much it is left.

31:06.610 --> 31:08.520
What was the total eddy size?

31:08.980 --> 31:13.930
That size minus how much is left are the number of elements which are picked where it is, when it is

31:14.440 --> 31:15.070
not oceans.

31:15.070 --> 31:16.540
Otherwise it's zero chance.

31:17.200 --> 31:17.480
Good.

31:17.710 --> 31:18.610
That's giving you a.

31:19.580 --> 31:21.470
If an end in sight for this problem.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.960
And then the next year the real we'll solve this problem again by using a different approach.

31:27.960 --> 31:31.620
And I'll just move quickly on that because it should be it should become easy.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.180
So thank you.

31:33.660 --> 31:34.230
In the next part.
