00:00.700 --> 00:01.120
Okay.

00:01.120 --> 00:05.740
So let's arrive to the first part of the series and which is a commentary on the game.

00:06.670 --> 00:10.090
Here I'll be defining and discussing what are commentary all games.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.010
So as you can see the definition.

00:13.030 --> 00:14.200
It is that commentary.

00:14.200 --> 00:20.530
The games are dubious and games with perfect information and no right and whether win or lose outcome.

00:21.400 --> 00:26.080
So I laid them point by point by point and then we'll discuss each of the points.

00:26.650 --> 00:28.330
The first part here is.

00:29.590 --> 00:29.970
There are.

00:31.840 --> 00:32.500
Two person.

00:33.420 --> 00:34.050
Playing the game.

00:38.110 --> 00:42.410
But in our case, in the in our series, we named him Allison Bob.

00:43.200 --> 00:43.370
Hmm.

00:46.230 --> 00:46.530
Cool.

00:47.490 --> 00:48.480
In short, Ian.

00:48.930 --> 00:49.200
Right.

00:50.170 --> 00:50.490
Okay.

00:51.150 --> 00:56.100
So the first part of the Commonwealth Games is that there are two persons playing, right, which is

00:56.100 --> 00:57.930
Alice and Bob for now.

00:58.260 --> 01:03.000
And we assume that both Alice and Bob are supercomputers.

01:06.110 --> 01:07.010
What does this mean?

01:08.480 --> 01:09.930
That they play optimally.

01:09.960 --> 01:10.320
Right.

01:10.340 --> 01:11.570
So let me date.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.250
And they're done optimally.

01:14.190 --> 01:16.350
The both the players are playing optimally.

01:16.980 --> 01:25.740
So it means that I'm in a particular location and if there is a chance to win eight little smiles,

01:25.740 --> 01:29.530
I'm on a particular position and it's a chance to win and I will win.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.730
I cannot unsee that.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.530
Eight So I'm playing optimally.

01:34.530 --> 01:40.620
If I can win, if there's a winning pattern, then I will play that burden only.

01:40.920 --> 01:41.970
So I'm a supercomputer.

01:42.420 --> 01:44.230
I'll win it, for example.

01:44.280 --> 01:49.560
For example, if you play chess, you can understand it in this way that let's say you're playing chess

01:49.560 --> 01:51.930
and you see a checkmate.

01:52.410 --> 01:55.160
A forced checkmate informs fate.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.460
Then you will play that move.

01:56.460 --> 01:57.510
Only you cannot.

01:57.510 --> 02:00.120
Like give Bob the second chance or third chance.

02:00.120 --> 02:00.840
Nothing like that.

02:01.260 --> 02:05.340
There are no optional moves, no chance moves, nothing like that.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.980
It's ideal situation, right?

02:08.400 --> 02:11.250
So there are two persons playing Allison Bob.

02:11.670 --> 02:13.080
Both of them are supercomputers.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.730
They are playing optimally and they are.

02:17.590 --> 02:19.060
Alternating guns.

02:22.590 --> 02:26.880
And so one day my list plays, then the ball plays and analysis and ball and so on.

02:27.480 --> 02:27.660
Right.

02:28.350 --> 02:31.080
Well, so in the second part, we'll see.

02:32.450 --> 02:33.970
I hope the first thing is clear to you all.

02:34.510 --> 02:37.130
Now, the second is that there are.

02:38.410 --> 02:39.040
Finite.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.070
Set of positions of the game.

02:44.960 --> 02:50.990
Out of positions, though always a game is defined by a set of positions and rules.

02:52.340 --> 02:56.860
So what we can see is a set of positions and moves.

02:58.340 --> 03:01.940
So there are there are a finite set of positions in a comedy or a real game.

03:02.240 --> 03:02.990
And, and.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.480
All the rules are predefined.

03:05.780 --> 03:08.480
That means they are defined with the perfect information.

03:08.810 --> 03:12.560
You cannot think of anything of our own.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.830
There should be no doubt in your mind when you read.

03:16.110 --> 03:22.610
Game to regulation because they are they contain the perfect information and there are no random moves,

03:22.620 --> 03:24.270
no dance move, nothing like that.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.970
So there's always a set of positions.

03:27.360 --> 03:33.330
And we are like in the whole of the game, we are jumping from one position to the other position by

03:33.330 --> 03:34.020
making a move.

03:34.950 --> 03:35.210
Clear.

03:35.430 --> 03:39.300
It's initially we were on some state X, we moved on the state by by making a move.

03:39.720 --> 03:44.400
Now the other plays on the State Y and then he will move again and again.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.190
The game will shift to another position.

03:47.260 --> 03:52.420
And now again, possibly, as John said, with so it's alternating and we are switching positions.

03:53.140 --> 03:55.030
So there's always a finite of positions.

03:55.060 --> 03:58.840
There cannot be an always countable set of positions.

03:59.560 --> 03:59.950
And.

04:01.030 --> 04:01.380
Right.

04:01.990 --> 04:06.710
So the rules of the game set specifically for the both of the players.

04:06.730 --> 04:13.630
So on the basis of that, I on the basis of that, we can classify the games into two parts impartial

04:13.630 --> 04:19.300
games in partisan games, eight impartial games in the desert of what's available from any given position

04:19.300 --> 04:24.250
is the same for both the players right and barred by shill games.

04:24.250 --> 04:30.100
Partisan games is in which each player has a different set of possible moves from a given position.

04:30.910 --> 04:33.100
Okay, so let's talk about chess.

04:35.340 --> 04:38.360
It's just a shell game or partially.

04:40.680 --> 04:45.810
Right, because white moves, because a player moves from white and the second player move from black

04:46.830 --> 04:48.810
but from a particular set.

04:48.900 --> 04:54.600
Both the players do not have the same option of moving into the picture that they both were playing

04:54.600 --> 04:54.870
on.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.850
Same pieces, that there were only one kind of pieces.

05:00.210 --> 05:03.960
And because the first guy was playing white cannot move black pieces.

05:04.230 --> 05:07.380
And that cigarette guy who's playing black cannot move the white pieces.

05:07.770 --> 05:08.020
Right.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.930
But let's say that was not the case.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.930
Each of them were able to play any move on the board.

05:13.230 --> 05:18.660
Then it can be considered as a imbecility because the set of rules.

05:18.930 --> 05:20.370
What each position?

05:21.070 --> 05:22.890
Hey, that's what I was talking about here.

05:22.920 --> 05:27.030
Positions that of rules for each position is same for both the players.

05:27.630 --> 05:30.270
If that is the case, then only it's an impartial game.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.820
Otherwise, it's a partial game.

05:33.470 --> 05:33.710
They.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.110
Always remember.

05:37.180 --> 05:43.510
If we are on the opposition and both the players are able to make the same move, whether it is a chance

05:43.510 --> 05:47.620
of Alice or Bob, but both are able to play the same moves from that position.

05:47.620 --> 05:48.820
There is no exception in that.

05:49.150 --> 05:51.580
If Alice, then this, if Bob, then this.

05:51.820 --> 05:52.510
Nothing like that.

05:53.380 --> 05:55.420
Then only we say them impartially.

05:56.280 --> 05:56.580
Eight.

05:57.630 --> 05:57.990
Okay.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.340
So we.

06:00.300 --> 06:00.970
Oh, no.

06:01.380 --> 06:01.590
Okay.

06:02.230 --> 06:02.550
Say.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.000
Yeah.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.140
So now what we have.

06:08.370 --> 06:09.310
This part is done.

06:09.330 --> 06:14.340
Then the next part is that there are two types of rules of the game.

06:14.940 --> 06:16.920
And the first one is the normal game.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.390
And the second is a misery.

06:18.930 --> 06:20.070
What does this mean, guys?

06:20.490 --> 06:22.410
Normal means, of course, guys.

06:22.410 --> 06:24.750
What will happen at a particular point of time?

06:24.750 --> 06:28.350
Because we have some final set of auditions, right.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.720
And we are always jumping from one person to another.

06:31.230 --> 06:36.950
So at some point of time, we will be reaching a communal position and redefining the dominant position,

06:36.970 --> 06:37.650
the next section.

06:40.620 --> 06:44.970
What is the manipulation when a player is not able to make a move from that position?

06:44.970 --> 06:47.150
It is a terminal position, right?

06:48.030 --> 06:48.300
So.

06:49.220 --> 06:52.430
At some point of time because we have finite number of positions.

06:52.430 --> 06:57.230
At some point of time, we will reach a terminal position from where nobody is able to make a move.

06:58.130 --> 07:00.470
So what happens in normal game is that.

07:01.650 --> 07:03.290
The normal.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.090
In normal.

07:05.090 --> 07:06.050
What happens there?

07:06.050 --> 07:08.930
The last player to move, Vince.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.370
Last year to make a move.

07:13.390 --> 07:13.760
Move.

07:13.840 --> 07:14.320
Vince.

07:15.620 --> 07:15.890
Good.

07:16.460 --> 07:17.980
So let's say I'm Alice.

07:17.990 --> 07:18.620
I give.

07:18.710 --> 07:19.290
I make.

07:19.310 --> 07:20.070
I made a move.

07:20.090 --> 07:23.270
Now, Bob is not able to make a move according to the rules.

07:23.900 --> 07:24.080
Right?

07:24.320 --> 07:28.250
Then Bob will lose in the normal game because I was the last player who made a move.

07:29.330 --> 07:29.630
So.

07:31.050 --> 07:34.590
Who's ever Jon Stewart is and is on the dominant position.

07:35.010 --> 07:35.580
If we lose.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.950
But the opposite happens in the middle.

07:42.860 --> 07:44.480
So what happens in this role?

07:54.100 --> 07:56.950
To make a move, Lewis.

07:57.950 --> 07:58.400
Well, you guys.

07:59.390 --> 08:01.250
So the last player who makes them will lose it.

08:01.250 --> 08:05.800
So we'll be discussing both of these days on the game of name in the name section.

08:06.380 --> 08:10.160
Normal name and the middle name and will derive the conditions.

08:10.310 --> 08:11.690
Isn't that right?

08:11.990 --> 08:14.840
In the next section we'll be discussing about the takeover games.

08:15.170 --> 08:16.040
So see you there.
