WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:01.800
Well, welcome back.

00:02.220 --> 00:03.080
It's time to go.

00:03.120 --> 00:05.970
This Independence Day problem and.

00:07.700 --> 00:08.040
Buddy.

00:08.280 --> 00:08.780
Yippee!

00:09.630 --> 00:09.870
Think.

00:10.590 --> 00:11.310
Try this.

00:12.270 --> 00:13.950
So what is the input that we have got?

00:14.070 --> 00:14.760
We have got.

00:14.940 --> 00:16.020
Let's take an input.

00:17.220 --> 00:20.030
And it's rated normally position eight.

00:20.550 --> 00:21.930
So we have to take a graph first.

00:21.940 --> 00:24.240
So for that, I usually take.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.540
Good to have it, Stig.

00:36.540 --> 00:38.040
The input, of course.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.060
We'll be needing in.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.890
Or I goes from zero to N minus one.

00:44.510 --> 00:47.720
Quickly taking the input to make this artery.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.610
X and this becomes very.

01:00.730 --> 01:04.950
So and I was under 10 minutes when X and Y got it.

01:05.380 --> 01:06.930
Now, what should be the final answer?

01:06.940 --> 01:07.780
Should be simple.

01:09.260 --> 01:09.700
BP.

01:10.010 --> 01:11.370
Let's take anything as a route.

01:11.540 --> 01:12.740
Let's take one of that or not.

01:13.610 --> 01:15.560
But if I'm bringing in black plastic.

01:16.660 --> 01:22.420
Plus if I'm printing it quite so deep one and quite so it is deep even.

01:23.110 --> 01:23.330
Well.

01:23.650 --> 01:30.040
So instead of having this type of thing, let's write a function, BP, which will give me one comma,

01:30.040 --> 01:32.290
one and one comma zero.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.300
That means I'm bringing that.

01:34.930 --> 01:37.840
So I'm either burning it black or white.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.770
And of course, guys, we have to worry about the modular part.

01:41.770 --> 01:42.730
We'll do that later.

01:42.760 --> 01:43.600
It's not a big deal.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.640
So let's take.

01:49.540 --> 01:52.330
Marred by 99 plus seven.

01:53.220 --> 01:53.670
And.

01:55.900 --> 02:01.330
Whenever I'm adding it, I just think Martin simply submitted it.

02:02.230 --> 02:03.520
Yeah, I think that should work.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.060
Full military to be a function.

02:09.140 --> 02:11.180
And Africa's evolution so deep current.

02:11.180 --> 02:13.670
And we have Rwanda be there forever.

02:13.820 --> 02:16.130
And I'm giving your dad the I'm giving it black or white.

02:17.210 --> 02:17.840
So initially.

02:18.710 --> 02:24.110
The answer is, one, we all look for the leaf, not because for the leaf not will never go inside this

02:24.230 --> 02:26.420
fun, which is the child for loop.

02:27.590 --> 02:30.590
So for all the child we are going for the continued.

02:31.500 --> 02:36.480
So what we have is we know that when we perform in the office, this child can be a parent, too, right?

02:36.840 --> 02:40.100
So we have this special condition, the danger of not being able to parent.

02:40.110 --> 02:40.740
We all know that.

02:41.610 --> 02:41.850
Well.

02:43.060 --> 02:49.330
So yeah so here we have entree goes to one child should not be called a parent we have to pass parent

02:49.330 --> 02:55.930
also because we do not know what are the parents of the nurse until unless we perform our DFS then passing

02:55.930 --> 02:58.630
zero as imagining imaginary parent of one.

02:58.630 --> 03:02.890
This should not be a problem it's normally of is eight and yeah.

03:03.190 --> 03:10.160
So here we have two conditions that if paint it means if it is right that means the parent is very different

03:10.160 --> 03:14.170
is one then answer is simply nothing but BP.

03:15.890 --> 03:16.400
Child.

03:18.020 --> 03:19.100
We can be entered zero.

03:19.550 --> 03:20.840
It means again painted black.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.150
And what will be the weight in order?

03:23.150 --> 03:23.930
It will be current.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.090
Let me increase the font.

03:27.950 --> 03:32.180
Well, that means I can paint that I know to be black.

03:32.780 --> 03:33.890
Also, I can be honest.

03:33.900 --> 03:34.580
I know to be.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.070
Right.

03:37.340 --> 03:38.630
And guarantees that it would not.

03:38.630 --> 03:39.980
Of course your deposit would not.

03:40.870 --> 03:41.830
And it won't be.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.600
Plus, it will be multiplication.

03:43.960 --> 03:44.290
Eight.

03:45.400 --> 03:45.630
So.

03:46.090 --> 03:47.830
Okay, let me write it properly.

03:47.950 --> 03:48.400
My daughter.

03:48.400 --> 03:48.940
Understand?

03:49.330 --> 03:49.580
Yeah.

03:49.780 --> 03:53.950
So if I'm bringing a fight, that means it should be multiplied in on.

03:53.950 --> 03:55.060
So what should be multiplied?

03:56.870 --> 03:57.300
Be.

03:58.300 --> 04:04.180
Child painted black Oscar and as a parent plus DP child.

04:05.100 --> 04:09.300
Painted white and bass got into the fitting eight.

04:09.300 --> 04:12.600
So when I'm adding them and I'm multiplying it to the answer.

04:13.830 --> 04:15.380
Let's stick on surf.

04:16.180 --> 04:16.620
Martello.

04:16.950 --> 04:17.190
Well.

04:18.350 --> 04:23.180
And if it is, if I'm bringing it back, then what was the answer?

04:23.570 --> 04:27.350
If I'm doing it black, if I'm just branding it black, that means.

04:29.280 --> 04:29.850
I can.

04:31.370 --> 04:33.260
Being the child needs to be only white.

04:33.530 --> 04:35.330
So that means it depends on the child.

04:35.720 --> 04:36.140
One.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.070
But it is a run rate.

04:40.070 --> 04:42.260
So let's take this on somewhat low here.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.210
Well, that will be for both these lives.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.490
And finally, what we'll do is build on that.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.230
And so let's build this one.

04:49.370 --> 04:49.680
Okay.

04:49.680 --> 04:50.880
So here's another problem.

04:51.800 --> 04:52.500
Well, I don't.

04:52.910 --> 04:53.720
I don't see.

04:56.040 --> 04:56.580
Okay.

04:57.950 --> 04:58.730
Denzel Big.

05:01.320 --> 05:01.580
We?

05:03.720 --> 05:09.570
So we started from envy going deal and minus when we are taking the input, we have DP 110.

05:09.570 --> 05:10.830
We're starting from the first note.

05:10.830 --> 05:14.070
We are we are having to be 100 and.

05:15.810 --> 05:17.970
We are living it white or black.

05:18.090 --> 05:20.790
So if I have a paint, I mean, I'm coloring, right?

05:20.790 --> 05:21.270
That means.

05:22.430 --> 05:28.940
The giant notes can be coloured either white or black will advise the child can only be coloured is

05:29.340 --> 05:31.490
quite so here.

05:31.490 --> 05:36.050
I don't think I need to have a base case because let's see if it's a leaf.

05:36.070 --> 05:38.780
Not even all this volume wouldn't work.

05:39.600 --> 05:39.830
Eight.

05:40.290 --> 05:45.840
If this follow won't work, or if not, that means answer was one and I'm simply running one.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.270
For both the parents, the answer will be one.

05:49.260 --> 05:49.560
Wait.

05:50.700 --> 05:51.510
Let me build this.

05:52.230 --> 05:53.190
So what we are getting.

05:53.730 --> 05:55.320
Is there a problem in this?

05:55.320 --> 05:57.210
Not so very long fight.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.980
And let me copy this.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.330
What we are getting.

06:00.330 --> 06:00.900
We are getting.

06:02.700 --> 06:03.150
Nine.

06:04.210 --> 06:05.680
And Bobby this.

06:09.110 --> 06:10.910
157 holidays.

06:11.060 --> 06:13.100
So this is a working solution.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.590
You can check this and.

06:18.620 --> 06:19.610
It's a medicine.

06:19.640 --> 06:23.780
Ed Gordon, I'll try to give you the next problem, but you should try it.

06:24.500 --> 06:24.830
Okay.

06:25.490 --> 06:25.820
Okay.

06:25.970 --> 06:28.370
So, of course, guys, this is a working solution.

06:28.370 --> 06:30.050
But here's one thing that we have missed.

06:31.070 --> 06:32.660
Or said one thing that we missed.

06:32.690 --> 06:33.140
Memories.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.250
We can easily see that all these are being calculated again and again.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.310
Eight whenever one will be called in that.

06:41.300 --> 06:44.510
The child will be called eight and it sailed through again.

06:44.510 --> 06:46.290
The next day it will be going well.

06:46.310 --> 06:52.280
So there are so we have to use memorization because again and again there are so many goals being met.

06:52.520 --> 06:57.540
If you want to check out how many calls are being made, just take and take a variable increment.

06:57.560 --> 07:01.730
The count they take account and do count plus, plus and check thereby.

07:01.730 --> 07:02.900
Also, many calls are being made.

07:03.380 --> 07:08.810
Of course this is not an optimal solution because it's just a regression or DB is optimizing equation.

07:08.810 --> 07:09.980
So how do we optimize it?

07:10.970 --> 07:11.570
Easy, right?

07:11.750 --> 07:12.800
We take a memo.

07:13.880 --> 07:18.950
Let's take memo one and two by two because it can be either black or white.

07:18.980 --> 07:24.620
We are not storing beer and we don't have to store braiding because every child or so every current

07:24.620 --> 07:26.660
node will have exactly one parent in India.

07:26.930 --> 07:31.680
We all know that with this passing you bypass the stick and I think it's great.

07:32.210 --> 07:33.140
So yeah.

07:33.290 --> 07:35.600
So initially what we'll do is we'll simply set.

07:38.680 --> 07:39.190
I'm said.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.120
Memo minus one size of.

07:44.310 --> 07:49.950
Memo will be sitting at minus one and we all know how we do things.

07:50.530 --> 07:51.030
The memo.

07:51.030 --> 07:53.310
Current and print.

07:54.750 --> 07:57.390
Pull and take it this.

07:58.760 --> 07:59.030
Yeah.

07:59.460 --> 08:01.700
And if you move on, we'll say answer is equal to one.

08:01.730 --> 08:03.350
Otherwise, if answer is not equal to.

08:04.380 --> 08:06.560
Minus one written answer.

08:06.780 --> 08:09.690
Otherwise, Megan set a goal to one into the last part.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.710
Food knowledge, summitry.

08:17.560 --> 08:23.230
And yes, after recording this audition, after trying this, I would like to like.

08:24.350 --> 08:25.760
I want you to try this problem.

08:25.760 --> 08:30.320
Vortex cover from high spin on unlimited eight.

08:31.550 --> 08:38.390
So do do do give this problem a try because you have actually learned how these deep countries work.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.720
But if you try this problem, it will strengthen your priorities, of course.

08:43.730 --> 08:48.350
And of course you can try numerous problems that you want 20 countries to standard of.

08:48.680 --> 08:54.800
What I do is whenever I'm learning a new topic, I just do around ten problems at the medium or hide

08:54.800 --> 08:59.090
from the topic so that I get a good grasp of the topic.

08:59.090 --> 09:00.710
Like how is it actually working?

09:01.220 --> 09:01.520
Eight.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.420
So here are two problems for you.

09:04.420 --> 09:06.820
So it's a correct solution.

09:06.820 --> 09:10.090
We have seen and it's working exactly fine.

09:10.780 --> 09:16.750
Well, for us in the next five guys, I hope you like this solution.
