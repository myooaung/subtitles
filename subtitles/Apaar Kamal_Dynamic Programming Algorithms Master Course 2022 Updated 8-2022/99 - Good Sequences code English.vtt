WEBVTT

00:00.680 --> 00:01.000
Yep.

00:01.040 --> 00:02.750
So let's go to this problem.

00:05.790 --> 00:07.290
Let me copy the input as well.

00:08.390 --> 00:09.700
Let's copy your be good input.

00:10.890 --> 00:11.110
Would.

00:13.810 --> 00:15.340
In Italy, we have an.

00:16.460 --> 00:17.420
Big in.

00:20.980 --> 00:21.370
I'm not a.

00:22.230 --> 00:27.080
And they adequately know what I have to do is let it rip.

00:28.140 --> 00:32.180
So you know that we we do not need this adding.

00:33.170 --> 00:35.270
We do not need this, Harry Reid.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.060
But if you want, I can even formulated it.

00:38.060 --> 00:44.010
Is that the values, the maximum values of all these prime numbers and which is already in this Harry

00:44.720 --> 00:44.920
Reid.

00:45.620 --> 00:45.860
So.

00:46.910 --> 00:50.240
Well, let's take both theories, but let's see.

00:51.780 --> 00:52.380
DP.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.510
DP Right.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.240
But what is the B primary here?

00:59.510 --> 01:00.620
It is the right one.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.740
What is a best earning prime is giving me?

01:04.700 --> 01:06.560
Well, and what should we do?

01:06.620 --> 01:11.570
FLINT Let's let's call it Flint so we know that it's still under the fire only.

01:11.940 --> 01:14.540
But let's take it for granted.

01:14.540 --> 01:15.080
We have five one.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.350
Yeah, many five plus one.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.340
Well and and what's the matter with it?

01:22.340 --> 01:25.220
I always use I always say a constraint in.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.490
And I think this area here.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.180
Keep prime.

01:33.830 --> 01:34.590
And you.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.990
Oh, let me just remove it from here.

01:40.010 --> 01:46.370
Because whatever I whatever the big regret is out there that I have all the Danish ladies, I always

01:46.370 --> 01:48.010
take it up on the keeper.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.840
Now let's go from one down.

01:51.140 --> 01:52.580
And what I need to do.

01:55.470 --> 01:56.970
It's a let's see what I need to do.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.120
Starting from one.

01:59.130 --> 02:02.460
First of all, I need to find out the primary readers of all these values.

02:03.420 --> 02:09.030
What I do is I simply quickly write down a function which is.

02:09.990 --> 02:12.300
Your primary with this if.

02:13.130 --> 02:13.730
Prime.

02:14.970 --> 02:16.590
If he says so, let's.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.490
Let's pass a number and do it.

02:19.490 --> 02:22.160
And this will give me all the brain to dissolve in.

02:22.160 --> 02:28.430
And if you do not know the logic behind this particular function, then you can.

02:28.850 --> 02:30.410
I think you can only.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.240
T or you can easily notice here as well.

02:34.250 --> 02:39.950
But all you can do are different courses, comedy, programming, both maybe.

02:40.550 --> 02:42.060
But it's a very easy thing, right?

02:42.080 --> 02:47.090
If you have dynamic programming, you're trying to understand dynamic programming, then this basic

02:47.090 --> 02:48.860
number theory algorithm.

02:50.160 --> 02:50.940
Is a cakewalk.

02:52.350 --> 02:52.980
So are you.

02:53.780 --> 02:55.080
What do I think?

02:55.380 --> 02:57.090
So give them to me this way.

02:57.240 --> 03:02.910
So instead of let's make it vector it what it will do, it will give me all the parameters of a number

03:02.910 --> 03:03.690
in it.

03:03.870 --> 03:08.440
So I'll start from two because primes start from two and I'll go into a less than equal to N.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.510
We all know this, right?

03:09.510 --> 03:10.830
I'm not explaining this part here.

03:12.260 --> 03:12.890
So let's.

03:14.290 --> 03:15.280
You go, Victor.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.290
What I'll do is if.

03:18.210 --> 03:19.350
And it's diesel by.

03:20.950 --> 03:21.970
Then simply.

03:24.620 --> 03:24.950
Okay.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.620
Then religious public lectures push back.

03:28.960 --> 03:34.630
I wish I came in there with a list and simply remove and.

03:38.980 --> 03:45.370
And B remove all the occurrences, all the powers of I know from it and slash it could do a.

03:47.320 --> 03:47.580
Well.

03:47.890 --> 03:49.240
And finally.

03:49.720 --> 03:49.920
Yeah.

03:49.960 --> 03:53.260
After this loop, it's over and is a prime number.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.610
What I would simply do, if any.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.330
The prime number.

03:57.960 --> 04:01.380
It's pushed back in and I knew, didn't they?

04:02.350 --> 04:02.610
Okay.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.290
Before moving on.

04:04.290 --> 04:05.370
Let's ask this.

04:06.690 --> 04:07.770
And let's see.

04:09.210 --> 04:12.750
We're going to test this for all these numbers, the numbers here.

04:13.030 --> 04:18.240
1 to 10, let's say vegetarian, divisors or let's see.

04:21.180 --> 04:27.750
Prime business and let's call the function, which is give primary visits if primary readers will pass

04:27.760 --> 04:28.390
a do it.

04:31.210 --> 04:32.530
Well, let's suppose they do it.

04:32.920 --> 04:33.430
So this.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.360
Vector will now have prime day with us.

04:39.230 --> 04:41.960
It's bringing out all the prejudices that I have.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.030
And then let's have an for.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.110
Is heated up at.

04:53.770 --> 04:54.040
Okay.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.210
I have not declared this.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.200
Insurance.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.000
No one does not have a primary visa.

05:02.060 --> 05:04.720
The first is one day they can and so on.

05:05.140 --> 05:08.200
Two, three, five, two, three, seven, two, three, two, four.

05:08.890 --> 05:12.010
And also, we can do this for a random number.

05:12.060 --> 05:13.060
Let's, let's let's see.

05:13.070 --> 05:13.810
This is a number.

05:14.380 --> 05:14.860
I've just.

05:15.650 --> 05:15.950
I just.

05:15.950 --> 05:16.790
I didn't remember.

05:16.940 --> 05:17.240
Right.

05:18.140 --> 05:18.770
So this is.

05:18.770 --> 05:23.780
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, ten, 11, 15, integer.

05:23.810 --> 05:26.510
So I'm just saying, we're going to do digits from this.

05:30.400 --> 05:30.670
Okay.

05:30.670 --> 05:36.490
So these are two prime numbers, three into three, five, four, one into two, three, nine, six,

05:36.490 --> 05:37.530
seven, eight.

05:37.540 --> 05:40.600
So this is what this number is made up of.

05:41.550 --> 05:42.390
I hope you're getting it.

05:42.940 --> 05:44.700
Also, let's put a bag here.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.780
And what what is the complexity of this function?

05:49.410 --> 05:54.330
Its complexity is the square root of N because as you can easily see that I'm just running a loop to

05:54.330 --> 05:58.020
square root of when I goes on little by little event.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.240
Otherwise it will break it to.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.480
Now, let me remove this.

06:06.510 --> 06:07.740
Now what we have to simply do.

06:09.170 --> 06:09.830
Let's come back.

06:10.310 --> 06:13.370
Now we have all the primary primary results of any of these numbers.

06:13.760 --> 06:18.710
What I have to do is I have to just find out the maximum value of all, the best training that these

06:18.720 --> 06:19.370
frames can give.

06:19.850 --> 06:23.470
When I founded Maximum Value as simply updating all the prime numbers.

06:24.950 --> 06:25.550
So yeah.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.000
So I'll just go for all the prime.

06:34.550 --> 06:34.820
Yeah.

06:34.910 --> 06:35.210
Let's go.

06:35.210 --> 06:38.150
For all the priming, let's find it fascinating.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.950
It's the best ending that anybody can give.

06:40.970 --> 06:42.710
So initially, let's take it as one.

06:43.370 --> 06:47.900
And best ending is max of ascending coma.

06:52.250 --> 06:52.760
E.

06:53.090 --> 06:54.580
What's said is name deep brain.

06:55.400 --> 06:55.550
It.

06:57.650 --> 07:02.030
It be prime x, whatever will be the best ending.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.770
It will be in this variable.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.290
Once this variable is here.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.620
Now, what I have to do is I simply have to updated my standing for all the frames.

07:11.000 --> 07:11.630
The next step.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.070
But let me copy this only.

07:16.880 --> 07:23.480
And what I'll do is simply say that BP Prime X is equal to the best in.

07:25.060 --> 07:27.640
Eight are instead of equal submission in English.

07:27.790 --> 07:28.420
It is.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.580
Cinemax, the sequel to.

07:34.840 --> 07:42.340
Now equal to to eight because if it was greater than the best ending, let's say the value was greater

07:42.340 --> 07:44.470
than the best earning of some prime extent.

07:44.470 --> 07:47.980
It would already be in best trending because it is all leading the mix of all the pain.

07:48.970 --> 07:52.870
So let's make it equal to best trending and let's move forward.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.530
So right now, what I'm doing is I'm not filling this area.

07:57.670 --> 07:58.720
I don't want to fill this out.

07:59.230 --> 08:03.130
The best ending is a variable and I'm just using that variable to fill this area.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.020
In the end, what I'll do, I simply.

08:06.850 --> 08:10.000
Print out whatever is the best ending that any of the prime can give.

08:11.120 --> 08:11.930
A school.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.520
I'm using the max element function.

08:16.650 --> 08:17.950
But what does Max 11 do?

08:17.960 --> 08:21.570
We just didn't meet the pointer of the maximum element in theory.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.590
I use the max.

08:24.160 --> 08:30.130
I find the maximum value of the brain because the maximum value of deep brain will also be the maximum

08:30.130 --> 08:30.970
value of this area.

08:31.600 --> 08:35.380
And because both of them are kind of using the best ending.

08:36.280 --> 08:40.450
But it is epi, prime coma, deep brain plus.

08:42.610 --> 08:47.030
Wade and whatever point of view didn't really influence it.

08:47.030 --> 08:48.890
And it will give me the best answer.

08:49.400 --> 08:49.850
Let's see.

08:50.880 --> 08:51.260
Okay.

08:51.270 --> 08:57.870
So there's something that I'm missing and that is plus one because I'm taking the good in the element

08:57.870 --> 08:58.200
as well.

08:58.290 --> 08:58.590
Right.

08:58.620 --> 09:03.360
So if I'm using the current element as a new best ending, then the best ending increases by one.

09:04.460 --> 09:04.700
Well.

09:06.020 --> 09:06.820
Oh, yeah.

09:09.350 --> 09:09.710
Right.

09:11.160 --> 09:11.460
Okay.

09:11.460 --> 09:14.660
So there's another issue that is I'm using this one.

09:14.670 --> 09:16.500
Let me quickly go you.

09:21.490 --> 09:21.750
Hmm.

09:21.880 --> 09:28.060
So it's giving me fiber, but it should not give me five because best ending can be zero as well.

09:28.420 --> 09:28.630
Yeah.

09:28.690 --> 09:29.830
No, not answer B.

09:29.830 --> 09:30.170
Correct.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.050
The best ending and B zero as well.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.700
I'm already taking it.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.900
I was already taking it to be one, which is not true.

09:38.890 --> 09:39.670
Otherwise it will be.

09:39.670 --> 09:41.350
One doesn't do well.

09:41.410 --> 09:42.790
So let's not declare this one.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.200
Let's initialize it with zero.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.000
And when will be?

09:47.520 --> 09:53.430
Popping Devaluing the People remix and then we'll improve it by one late night will solve my problem.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.950
Let's go to the previous just case and build it.

09:56.400 --> 10:02.490
Yeah for again I hope you got this and this for the slide to give problem and.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.640
It will give you.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.680
We should think about any repercussions.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.150
It's not always the numbers.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.310
They can be their primary reasons as well.

10:14.240 --> 10:19.790
And as the problem demands for the complexity of this problem, this is going from zero to an.

10:19.790 --> 10:23.960
And in this loop I'm trying to call this function, which is primary reasons, which is square root

10:23.960 --> 10:24.290
of an.

10:25.880 --> 10:32.120
So in the worst case where I can have and squared of n which will work because the time limit is a second

10:32.120 --> 10:32.360
date.

10:33.020 --> 10:40.190
It is an incredible faith in the world of narrative above i it's approximately about seven and it's

10:40.190 --> 10:42.020
a good complexity to make it work.

10:42.740 --> 10:45.260
And there's nothing much we are doing these loops.

10:45.290 --> 10:47.180
These are less than log in loops.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.230
You should know this.

10:48.830 --> 10:55.310
So what I remember the primary results are at most login and they will be less than log in.

10:55.820 --> 10:56.300
Log based.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.560
We will.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.560
So these are all the these are the parts of number 30.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.880
You should have a good grasp of that.

11:07.310 --> 11:11.050
This this was a problem, which was a mixture of number 13 and reprogramming.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.020
Will go.

11:13.990 --> 11:18.360
It wasn't easy problem but yeah I took even in the next four days and.
