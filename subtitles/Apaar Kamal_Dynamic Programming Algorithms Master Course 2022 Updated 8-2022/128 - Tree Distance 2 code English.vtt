WEBVTT

00:00.590 --> 00:00.890
Yeah.

00:00.940 --> 00:01.700
We were here.

00:02.180 --> 00:02.510
So.

00:04.680 --> 00:05.250
Slate.

00:05.700 --> 00:05.970
Yeah.

00:07.360 --> 00:11.170
The first thing is, let's not get confused.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.270
Let's just make these things separate.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.270
And you.

00:16.570 --> 00:22.030
So firstly this afternoon will not be able to it again and again because.

00:23.200 --> 00:27.370
It will be explosive tax rate because if you want to.

00:29.380 --> 00:36.040
I hope you got this right because viavi via a we're dickering again and again for all details before

00:36.060 --> 00:40.570
all data, literally just a geosynthetics only way to find the current them.

00:40.930 --> 00:48.070
And also in this case if we have if current admins in the I'm finally adding these some of the parent

00:48.070 --> 00:48.340
grade.

00:48.350 --> 00:52.840
So I have this some of the parent but they are added one distance apart.

00:52.840 --> 00:57.070
Alternate it is some of parent plus the number of nodes the parent is.

00:58.030 --> 01:02.860
That means the number of the nodes that this laboratory has right now, which is nothing but.

01:03.770 --> 01:05.240
And minus edge of current.

01:06.150 --> 01:06.550
Correct.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.200
Which is?

01:07.200 --> 01:08.680
There's only eight.

01:09.180 --> 01:09.600
And.

01:10.290 --> 01:10.560
Yeah.

01:10.590 --> 01:13.940
Now, let's focus on the new some new some that's going to pass.

01:13.950 --> 01:17.280
So it is some building blocks and minutes, etc..

01:17.460 --> 01:18.030
That's true.

01:18.180 --> 01:18.450
Right.

01:18.450 --> 01:19.950
So this this is correct.

01:20.370 --> 01:24.750
The second part is, I have to add in new some parent.

01:24.750 --> 01:32.040
What I have to add is I have to add these some of other downloads of the current except for the x eight.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.860
So and then what will that some be equal to?

01:34.860 --> 01:37.250
It will be called a g current minus.

01:37.260 --> 01:44.790
If I break the some of the current notes, basically I'm detaching the current to note eight.

01:45.450 --> 01:52.530
I'm detaching the current I know wrong which I'm going to h which is nothing more g x minus x six.

01:54.090 --> 01:55.260
So do you get installed?

01:55.270 --> 01:56.400
The distance of all?

01:56.760 --> 02:03.840
If I wanted to stick around because I wanted some to be propagated downwards, then I will simply subtract

02:03.900 --> 02:04.620
the continents.

02:04.620 --> 02:06.270
And this is nothing with detaching it.

02:07.110 --> 02:09.900
And then we'll just pass the new some parent downwards.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.120
Let me let.

02:13.390 --> 02:13.690
Okay.

02:13.690 --> 02:18.430
So this and and has not been declared so.

02:19.090 --> 02:19.280
Yeah.

02:19.510 --> 02:20.530
The end is over here.

02:21.310 --> 02:25.780
Let's declare an on the top and it's remove the end from here but we want to use it.

02:26.200 --> 02:34.480
The second part is okay, so these are not the values that we expect because yeah, it is six, nine,

02:34.480 --> 02:34.690
five.

02:35.380 --> 02:40.810
The second part is I'm passing this as minus one as in the previous problem, somebody should be positive

02:40.810 --> 02:49.060
zero eight and again, so we have six three, seven, eight eight and again we can see that eight it

02:49.060 --> 02:49.420
is good.

02:49.660 --> 02:50.260
Six is good.

02:50.260 --> 02:52.750
But what about a three and seven?

02:52.810 --> 02:53.020
Eight.

02:53.290 --> 02:54.970
So let's see what we are doing.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.000
This is perfectly fine.

02:58.000 --> 02:58.480
And.

03:01.810 --> 03:02.100
Yeah.

03:02.110 --> 03:05.560
So they should be not minus they should replace it.

03:05.830 --> 03:10.780
It means I want to detest the current rate so I can write it as like this.

03:10.780 --> 03:12.700
There it is, minus and minus.

03:13.090 --> 03:17.710
But instead let's just be tested like this that I want to subtract the Carrington rate.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.170
So let me just quickly explain what is this doing?

03:20.860 --> 03:27.070
So if from build it from some current naught, I want to go to this X naught and we know what do of

03:27.070 --> 03:27.850
current stores.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.450
It stores the distances for what all the other generate.

03:31.750 --> 03:38.620
But now let's say I want to beat, I don't want this answer whatever is for the X because I'm passing

03:38.620 --> 03:40.320
that as a new sum from the rate.

03:40.570 --> 03:42.700
So I will simply subtract in this.

03:42.700 --> 03:46.300
I simply subtract x minus x eight.

03:46.840 --> 03:52.030
That means or I can say subtract explicit x whatever the value was for this.

03:52.630 --> 03:53.860
I just subtracted and.

03:56.020 --> 04:03.060
Subtracted from the total sum so that I can get this sum for all other notes and for all the other of

04:03.070 --> 04:04.930
I have got this idea subtracted from this.

04:04.930 --> 04:09.340
And similarly we'll add that into the news and put it in basic.

04:10.270 --> 04:16.760
This part is very tricky, but it's understandable, and some of you might have already sold it to it.

04:16.780 --> 04:18.280
It just requires some patience.

04:18.730 --> 04:19.970
And I hope you understood this.

04:19.990 --> 04:23.110
We don't have to aggregate it here.

04:23.110 --> 04:30.130
We have to add it because if I are decoding it again and again, again and again, then it will be I'm

04:30.130 --> 04:31.190
doing it for all X.

04:31.210 --> 04:32.410
It doesn't make sense actually.

04:32.410 --> 04:32.680
Right.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.610
So it will just be simple will just add the explicit X.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.830
And the second thing is the last thing is the final left current, which is coming from the parent eight.

04:43.360 --> 04:47.710
What is coming from the parent something and it's coming eight but there are some nodes alternate.

04:47.710 --> 04:54.880
So if I want to add something to then I have to just add the S6 part also eight, which is nothing and

04:54.880 --> 04:55.900
minus its current.

04:56.970 --> 04:58.740
Let me read it again at the beginning.

04:58.740 --> 04:59.830
Correct answers.

05:00.660 --> 05:01.040
Okay.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.060
So right now.

05:06.320 --> 05:06.580
Okay.

05:07.010 --> 05:08.720
So let's move back and.

05:10.530 --> 05:16.050
We have already tried adding some bread and butter and getting there and adding the number of notes

05:16.050 --> 05:17.160
in that subject.

05:17.970 --> 05:19.170
Well, now, let me read it.

05:20.940 --> 05:21.210
Okay.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.490
So we have the correct answer.

05:23.490 --> 05:28.750
And there's just one more thing that's missing, and that is very tricky to find out.

05:28.770 --> 05:32.340
But let me tell you what I know.

05:32.340 --> 05:34.140
We are calculating some sums over distances.

05:34.140 --> 05:34.370
Right.

05:34.380 --> 05:38.940
And the value, the end is very large, which is doing the above right.

05:39.390 --> 05:43.290
So it's quite possible that the answer will exceed int limit.

05:43.980 --> 05:50.410
So far that what we do is we just dig in this long, long and right.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.730
Or you can take a long, long anywhere in the good.

05:55.080 --> 05:55.440
And.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.430
Just feel free to some discord now.

05:59.100 --> 06:03.150
I want to share this and I know it was very tricky when I got confused.

06:04.440 --> 06:08.610
But just don't get confused in pluses and minuses.

06:08.640 --> 06:08.910
Right.

06:09.390 --> 06:10.850
So here I'm just using brackets eight.

06:10.860 --> 06:15.660
But what you can do is you can have some extra another variable say into.

06:16.970 --> 06:19.040
It's a current child.

06:20.090 --> 06:26.900
Values, which is nothing but je x plus n6 which has already been calculated.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.700
I can just subtract.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.170
Getting daily values.

06:32.280 --> 06:38.910
It's so you to take different variables in the formula to answer because you know, it can be very tricky

06:40.020 --> 06:41.460
to see in the next part.

06:41.460 --> 06:49.320
And in the next part what we'll be doing is we'll be solving company queries one to Eastern Square queries

06:49.320 --> 06:49.650
guarding.

06:49.650 --> 06:55.770
But I don't know how much of it will be covered in the underlying programming, but I'll try my best

06:55.770 --> 06:56.970
to go over everything possible.

06:58.260 --> 06:59.070
Well, thank you, everyone.
