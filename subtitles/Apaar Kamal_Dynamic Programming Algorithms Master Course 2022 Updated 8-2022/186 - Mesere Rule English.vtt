00:00.770 --> 00:01.040
Okay.

00:01.040 --> 00:03.050
So in the last section we discussed about.

00:04.610 --> 00:07.390
A simple takeaway game under the normal rule eight.

00:07.430 --> 00:14.750
So in this section we'll be discussing about a simple pick of a game under the Federal eight.

00:14.850 --> 00:15.230
Okay.

00:20.660 --> 00:25.200
Well, what is a rule as we saw that?

00:25.230 --> 00:29.550
What are the major one when the last player who makes a move loses weight?

00:29.940 --> 00:36.240
So if a lot if a player who is making a move loses, then can we define the set of positions, losing

00:36.240 --> 00:37.830
and winning positions accordingly, guys?

00:38.740 --> 00:40.930
It should be an easy task for, you know.

00:41.590 --> 00:47.560
First of all, I would suggest you do pause the video and try it yourself, because there isn't very

00:47.560 --> 00:48.520
much to do in this.

00:49.240 --> 00:55.960
And also, I will be doing it because the video will feed, pause the video and try it yourself first.

00:56.380 --> 00:56.640
I.

00:57.620 --> 00:57.950
Okay.

01:09.380 --> 01:09.640
Eight.

01:15.490 --> 01:15.850
Okay.

01:16.180 --> 01:19.450
So let me just quickly make this area and.

01:21.250 --> 01:25.960
It struck about the same game with the same rules, a normal, simple takeaway game.

01:26.470 --> 01:26.700
Right.

01:27.430 --> 01:30.520
So they just are sliding on the rule that it's the middle.

01:31.660 --> 01:35.830
So if I see zero, what is a zero position?

01:36.340 --> 01:38.830
Is it a winning position or a losing position?

01:39.700 --> 01:40.480
Let me check.

01:45.700 --> 01:46.000
Okay.

01:46.030 --> 01:52.030
So what is a zero guys this said this position zero is will it be a winning position or losing position

01:52.030 --> 01:52.660
and the the given.

01:53.590 --> 01:59.200
So if I am one zero, what does this mean that the previous player who played them move gave me this

01:59.200 --> 02:05.740
particular position and I'm unable to move the one this be a winning position for me because the previous

02:06.370 --> 02:12.460
player who played the previous move lost it because according to the rule, the previous player who

02:12.460 --> 02:16.090
plays it, the last player who plays the plays, any move loses.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.620
So it's a winning position.

02:17.620 --> 02:17.850
No.

02:18.250 --> 02:18.530
Right.

02:18.760 --> 02:23.920
Let's talk about one the from when I get, I'm only able to go to zero, which is a winning position

02:24.370 --> 02:25.660
to end discussed earlier.

02:25.660 --> 02:31.270
If I'm only able to go to some winning positions, then the current will be a losing position for me.

02:31.630 --> 02:36.730
As can also see that if there are only one stones left in the pile, I pick up that stone.

02:37.330 --> 02:41.110
I have no other option and I can only lose both.

02:41.110 --> 02:43.720
I'm the last player to make a move now from two.

02:44.700 --> 02:45.570
I can go to one.

02:46.020 --> 02:46.920
I can go to zero.

02:47.550 --> 02:51.630
Well, one is a losing position and zero is a winning issue.

02:51.850 --> 02:52.670
What should I do?

02:52.680 --> 02:55.920
I should go to one five because it's my chance.

02:56.070 --> 03:01.920
I want the other guy to lose, so I'll give him a losing position from the well, pick up one stone

03:01.920 --> 03:05.760
and give one as a next position to the other guy.

03:06.690 --> 03:08.970
So it's a winning position from three.

03:09.210 --> 03:15.090
I'm able to go to zero, also one or two and do also again, there's at least one losing position,

03:15.090 --> 03:15.390
right?

03:15.900 --> 03:18.060
There should be at least one losing position.

03:19.450 --> 03:19.710
Okay.

03:19.750 --> 03:25.480
So let's say there is let's call them child from a particular node.

03:25.480 --> 03:29.350
I'm able to move on to some child nodes over all these are nodes.

03:30.070 --> 03:32.320
At least one of them is a losing position.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.780
Then the current determining point eight.

03:35.290 --> 03:44.050
So from three I am able to go to 0012 and one is a losing position currently is a winning position again

03:44.050 --> 03:46.570
because of elevation, because one is a losing weight.

03:47.080 --> 03:51.550
Again, five will be a losing position because I'm not able to go to any of the losing positions from

03:51.550 --> 03:51.820
this.

03:51.820 --> 03:55.030
I'm only able to go to two, three, four, which is a winning position.

03:56.030 --> 03:58.320
Right and right.

03:58.340 --> 03:59.420
Let's talk about six.

04:00.650 --> 04:01.040
Okay.

04:02.100 --> 04:02.640
From six.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.280
I'm going to three or four or five, so.

04:06.210 --> 04:06.390
Five.

04:06.450 --> 04:07.410
It's a losing position.

04:08.190 --> 04:15.060
The winning bullish and then similarly losing, winning and losing eight was the pattern that we observe

04:15.060 --> 04:15.300
here.

04:15.690 --> 04:20.760
If dn mod four equals to one, that means it's a losing position.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.840
Otherwise it's a winning position.

04:28.570 --> 04:35.460
Okay, so under normal rule, all dominant positions are losing positions under normal rule.

04:35.610 --> 04:38.460
But in this case, as we see, that zero is a terminal position.

04:38.460 --> 04:41.280
But, you know, it's not a winning position.

04:41.970 --> 04:42.270
Right.

04:43.410 --> 04:43.800
Okay.

04:44.100 --> 04:49.140
Well, what I'm doing over here is I'm converting a takeaway game to a breaking game.

04:49.140 --> 04:51.870
I'm trying to subtract things from you and.

04:53.050 --> 04:58.870
Then generalising the auditions backwards according to the backward induction.

04:59.890 --> 05:06.580
In the next video we'll be looking over some varieties of take over games not only one, two in three

05:07.060 --> 05:10.080
will be considering, let's say one, two, three, four, five.

05:11.320 --> 05:16.310
And we can also consider one, three and four, eight any sort of thinking.

05:16.810 --> 05:22.210
So let's say we have a subtraction game with some set of items that can be subtracted.

05:22.540 --> 05:27.070
We have this set, and by using this we will generalize all winning and losing.

05:27.070 --> 05:27.270
But.

05:28.160 --> 05:28.400
Eight.

05:28.540 --> 05:30.010
So see, in the next five days.

05:30.040 --> 05:30.460
Thank you.
