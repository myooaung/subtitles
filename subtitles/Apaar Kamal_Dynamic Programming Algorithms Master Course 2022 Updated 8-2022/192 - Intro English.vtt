I also we all know there are various advantages to structures that help us to optimize some time complexity.

00:07.430 --> 00:12.250
Similarly, what these data structures can do, they can it can help us.

00:12.260 --> 00:17.930
They can assist us in optimizing the dynamic programming solutions.

00:19.100 --> 00:26.030
So these advantages structures can be like memories and victories, biometrics.

00:26.360 --> 00:31.760
Maybe you can use the you or produce it.

00:32.120 --> 00:38.360
These are some advantages structures which all have their own different structures according to which

00:38.360 --> 00:41.090
they work and they have their own certain set of algorithms.

00:41.660 --> 00:48.800
And those algorithms help us optimize some quality time, some space time, some memory time complexity.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.040
Right?

00:50.180 --> 00:55.640
So basically in the next in the next few videos, what we'll see is will try to optimize the dynamic

00:55.640 --> 01:01.730
programming problem that we have already seen and will try to optimize it further to even reduce more

01:01.730 --> 01:03.140
space time complexity of it.

01:04.060 --> 01:04.230
Good.

01:04.570 --> 01:06.220
So I'll see you in the next part.

01:06.580 --> 01:09.880
And this might be one of the most interesting parts of this course.

01:10.240 --> 01:10.410
Eight.

01:10.870 --> 01:11.410
Oh, yeah.

01:11.470 --> 01:12.580
See you in the next part, everyone.

01:12.670 --> 01:13.150
Thank you.
