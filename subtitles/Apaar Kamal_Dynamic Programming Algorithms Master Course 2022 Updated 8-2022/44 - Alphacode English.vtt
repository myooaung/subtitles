WEBVTT

00:01.020 --> 00:02.190
Everyone welcome.

00:02.820 --> 00:06.900
And in the event the U.S. will code now some partitioning problems.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.180
And those are also very famous problems.

00:09.660 --> 00:11.550
This is one example of such a problem.

00:11.550 --> 00:14.310
And we will see how many parties in problems are there.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.600
We see some various examples and in the assignments you can solve those problems.

00:19.570 --> 00:21.630
So this is a good problem for us.

00:21.640 --> 00:24.010
But called alphacode and.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.080
Very famous as well.

00:26.650 --> 00:32.740
So, listen, we need to synchronize to each other and are discussing ways to encode their messages.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.220
He's a smart, small conversation.

00:36.640 --> 00:42.730
And let's let's just use a very simple code will assign the code one, be the code two.

00:43.030 --> 00:46.320
And so down that being as I understand it.

00:46.660 --> 00:48.310
Well, basically they have mapped.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.590
We keep on writing also.

00:52.360 --> 00:54.190
There is one.

00:55.110 --> 00:59.250
They want to send a message and they have they are encoding their message into.

01:00.680 --> 01:05.810
Numbers, though Bob says that's not a good code.

01:05.840 --> 01:10.060
Suppose I say I knew the word being encoded as, ooh, 5114.

01:10.110 --> 01:11.830
You're going to call it in many different ways.

01:12.200 --> 01:12.460
Eight.

01:13.010 --> 01:16.460
If so, how can 25114 really go in many different ways?

01:17.090 --> 01:25.190
And this you you could but what words would you get other than being you had good we e okay so how is

01:25.640 --> 01:28.880
our we are getting in from this let's see this two is B.

01:29.870 --> 01:30.280
Obviously.

01:31.650 --> 01:33.180
So here we are, partitioning it.

01:33.180 --> 01:33.480
Okay.

01:34.080 --> 01:39.120
Is 2511 or one partition?

01:39.420 --> 01:43.200
It can partition, partition and fold partition.

01:43.500 --> 01:47.260
This is b, e, e and eight.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.310
Now there can be different ways of partitioning it.

01:51.420 --> 01:53.550
Let's see some other ways as well.

01:54.750 --> 01:58.020
So the next what he says is can be be it.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.510
That means all of them are single partitions.

02:00.690 --> 02:05.190
This becomes beed8.

02:07.220 --> 02:10.250
Either one can be violated by all this.

02:10.280 --> 02:14.630
25 is by ee ee ee ee two by 80.

02:15.110 --> 02:22.250
Basically we are partitioning our string here in that case and which is indirectly a number, but it's

02:22.250 --> 02:27.530
a string let's say, and we are partitioning it such that all the partitions lie between one and 26

02:27.830 --> 02:33.350
and we are we are trying to find out various different ways of partitioning it, but it says I think

02:33.380 --> 02:36.620
you would be able to figured out the correct decoding.

02:37.340 --> 02:39.860
And why would you send me the word being anyway?

02:40.580 --> 02:45.530
Okay, so maybe that's a bad example, but if you that if you go to the string of length 5000, the

02:45.550 --> 02:50.610
good returns are different encoding and with that many you would find at least two different ones.

02:50.630 --> 02:50.990
Okay.

02:51.680 --> 02:57.470
So at least as a simple question, how many different according to possible if I if Bob sends him some

02:57.470 --> 02:57.730
words.

02:58.770 --> 03:02.090
But for some reason, Allison's unconvinced.

03:02.090 --> 03:07.010
And she wants a he wants you to decode the strings and tell how many different recordings are possible.

03:07.970 --> 03:14.270
So will not only decode the string, we will also bring all possible recordings to logistic a follow

03:14.270 --> 03:19.220
problem on LS and see how to approach the partitioning problems.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.680
The input would consider multiple inputs.

03:21.890 --> 03:22.190
Okay.

03:22.190 --> 03:23.180
That is an input though.

03:23.210 --> 03:24.230
This is a first input.

03:24.230 --> 03:26.570
Second input for input.

03:26.570 --> 03:33.440
And finally, when we get a zero, the program will terminate and the answers will be within the range

03:33.440 --> 03:35.170
of 60 would sign in detail.

03:35.180 --> 03:36.230
So just remember.

03:37.190 --> 03:39.890
Let's just stick in bed long, long and cool.

03:40.490 --> 03:44.420
And the next season it's this is the example.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.660
Caputo before moving on to the audience and discuss the problem.

03:51.420 --> 03:54.920
So what we will do is in these types of problems, we will simply.

03:56.970 --> 03:57.210
Right.

03:57.660 --> 03:58.310
And we'll see.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.330
In Italy, we're on the zero eight.

04:00.750 --> 04:03.720
Oh, let's call it, I think in Italy.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.190
My eyes over here.

04:06.990 --> 04:10.530
So the two of you are on I and this I can be anywhere in this ring.

04:10.530 --> 04:14.160
We all know what every dining room problem we can imagine.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.780
We are on the bus.

04:16.020 --> 04:16.980
We are on the last row.

04:16.980 --> 04:18.090
We are somewhere in the middle.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.310
The same negative relation hold.

04:21.330 --> 04:22.140
Just think about.

04:22.650 --> 04:23.940
You are somewhere in this thing.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.710
What all options do you have?

04:26.280 --> 04:27.720
And then you can take this character.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.680
You can take this connector only if it is between one and nine.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.940
So you cannot take this character itself if it is a zero character.

04:38.510 --> 04:39.530
I hope you are getting the point.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.230
So let's say it was 20114.

04:42.230 --> 04:45.320
So this zero, we cannot take this zero individually.

04:45.320 --> 04:48.200
We have to take this the zero with the two eight.

04:48.320 --> 04:53.880
So in that case, we just have a normal check that if it is a two good.

04:54.440 --> 04:58.880
Now tell me how many different in the encoding the possible from a plus one.

05:00.230 --> 05:00.490
Right.

05:00.530 --> 05:05.420
So this becomes the API is equal to DP plus one.

05:06.210 --> 05:07.620
And now.

05:08.900 --> 05:15.920
This this A-plus plan is only possible if if this current number will, of course, have a check whenever

05:15.920 --> 05:20.720
you are calling, I plus one will have this check that if the number is between one in nine, that means

05:21.050 --> 05:24.110
this one in nine can convert into any of these single digits.

05:24.350 --> 05:24.650
Eight.

05:24.770 --> 05:28.400
So is what is one BS to go underline?

05:28.880 --> 05:30.680
That means it can be converted.

05:30.770 --> 05:32.240
That is a one option that I have.

05:32.810 --> 05:33.740
The second option is.

05:34.850 --> 05:38.180
Instead of taking one number, what I can do is I can do two numbers.

05:38.990 --> 05:44.330
That means I can make a partition activity sticker number like this and see.

05:44.630 --> 05:45.380
Now tell me.

05:47.010 --> 05:50.670
What is their defending coatings possible from A-plus?

05:51.180 --> 05:52.920
That means of destroying A-plus.

05:54.120 --> 05:58.800
From A to do it to basically what was meant to be functioning a little deeper.

05:58.830 --> 06:01.140
It represents, but often coatings.

06:02.990 --> 06:04.030
Our recordings.

06:05.110 --> 06:05.740
Possible.

06:08.320 --> 06:14.500
In spring I bill and I basically the suffix.

06:15.130 --> 06:22.120
It started I get into the how many things are possible and that we can see itself at the beginning.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.880
Take one character and then we can take one character.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.530
But it will have a simple check.

06:26.530 --> 06:30.580
The check is nothing, but the character should be between one and nine.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.350
And we will get this.

06:32.950 --> 06:36.700
Or we can take two characters with a simple take.

06:36.700 --> 06:45.460
Again, that the body characters come combined are greater than one and less than 26, if any character.

06:45.460 --> 06:45.850
Let's see.

06:46.750 --> 06:47.140
Okay.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.550
Let me give you a quick example.

06:48.580 --> 06:51.820
Let's let's initially I made this partition.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.110
That means I took only two.

06:53.110 --> 06:56.830
And I'm asking how many different ways are there from five and one and four?

06:57.250 --> 07:02.080
I cannot take five in one together because 51 does not represent any of the numbers.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.710
I just need to check if I'm taking some two numbers in a plus one.

07:06.140 --> 07:09.250
They should be between one in 26.

07:10.840 --> 07:16.540
And so these are some small, small things that we can do so that this becomes my new recursive relation.

07:17.290 --> 07:20.300
This function will only be called with the check.

07:20.350 --> 07:22.480
Again, this function will only be called with a check.

07:22.930 --> 07:28.720
So this is kind of an easy problem because there's nothing much that we need to think about it.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.010
We just have to what?

07:30.010 --> 07:31.350
Any dining room problem?

07:31.390 --> 07:33.850
What we have to do is we have to just figure out the options we have.

07:34.390 --> 07:38.500
If it's about taking option, ignore option, find out different.

07:39.580 --> 07:45.910
If there are many different actions that we can take all the actions and combine them.

07:46.990 --> 07:48.940
So this was a very simple problem.

07:48.940 --> 07:51.850
And in this case, let me quickly draw.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.620
Let me be clear.

07:55.640 --> 08:01.880
The streets are -- in which in five different recordings in this show, as you can see, the answer

08:01.880 --> 08:03.890
for this is six.

08:03.980 --> 08:04.220
Right.

08:04.550 --> 08:05.150
It is two.

08:06.120 --> 08:08.880
511482.

08:09.270 --> 08:13.820
I'll start from my let's see how the how medication will go ahead of us.

08:13.830 --> 08:19.230
It will try to take to into the place and then what it will do is it will make a partition here.

08:20.010 --> 08:20.910
One partition is.

08:22.510 --> 08:26.440
Two is already taken, which is kind of represented as be eight.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.480
And I have five and one four.

08:28.810 --> 08:31.930
Basically I have 5114 to be partition.

08:32.650 --> 08:34.300
And it can can be.

08:36.260 --> 08:36.740
23.

08:36.900 --> 08:40.670
So I'm thinking 25 is one that means this is my partition right now.

08:41.150 --> 08:46.790
I'm making this as a partition and the remaining that I have is one, one and four.

08:46.820 --> 08:51.320
Okay, let me write the characters as well.

08:51.770 --> 08:53.450
Now, let's talk about this.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.510
So I cannot take 51 together.

08:56.630 --> 09:00.170
So in this case, what I can do is I can only take five as an individual character.

09:00.830 --> 09:03.770
So if I'm taking five in an individual character, it is eight.

09:04.310 --> 09:10.070
This will give me B, E, and what strings I will be left with 1148.

09:10.370 --> 09:11.630
I cannot take 51 times.

09:12.200 --> 09:15.950
So in this case, I cannot make a S.R.O. which is taking two together.

09:17.550 --> 09:24.900
In this case I can take one which is via E and one for Rosa remain in character.

09:25.290 --> 09:28.980
The second is Y 11, eight towards 11.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.440
Let me quickly check.

09:32.330 --> 09:32.600
Yeah.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.400
11 should be okay.

09:34.850 --> 09:39.080
Well, so v e and I have four as a remaining string.

09:39.530 --> 09:40.580
Eight in the next day.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.240
What will happen?

09:42.560 --> 09:43.200
This be?

09:43.460 --> 09:44.480
This moment will be.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.360
It will try to divide into two parts again.

09:47.840 --> 09:48.290
And.

09:49.850 --> 09:50.430
I won't.

09:50.870 --> 09:51.170
Yeah.

09:51.260 --> 09:52.370
One one for you.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.960
Buy a Viking here.

09:53.990 --> 09:54.740
One for his left.

09:54.740 --> 09:54.860
Here.

09:54.860 --> 09:55.490
For his left.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.050
Emily, what will happen then?

09:57.770 --> 09:59.100
We already home right now.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.910
Only I have this string, which is 114.

10:02.180 --> 10:05.810
As you can see, 114 was already divided into two parts of it here eight.

10:06.200 --> 10:15.710
But it will be the same structure, but this time it will be with B and E, but it is P, e, e and

10:16.430 --> 10:23.600
one for advice it will be b, e e and what I hope we are getting this.

10:24.560 --> 10:28.340
Now you can easily see here, although it is one foot here for one foot and foot.

10:29.720 --> 10:35.990
Basically, what will happen, this substructure of one one foot will repeat, but initially it will

10:36.350 --> 10:39.740
be in the second time it will appear with very.

10:41.320 --> 10:44.170
And this three will further break down.

10:44.230 --> 10:46.690
Let let me break it down because it's not.

10:47.880 --> 10:48.270
Huge.

10:49.350 --> 10:49.650
Yeah.

10:49.960 --> 10:54.100
So now this can be divided into B, E is already there.

10:54.120 --> 10:59.760
So one in four eight and there I can take one individually, which is E and I will have a string for.

11:00.110 --> 11:01.890
Otherwise I can take one in four together.

11:01.890 --> 11:06.320
So which is b e and what should be in eight?

11:06.630 --> 11:07.950
And in this case, what will happen?

11:07.950 --> 11:10.050
I only a single string which is four.

11:10.110 --> 11:14.670
So it will be b e key and four is a b, c, d eight.

11:15.840 --> 11:23.130
And finally, this will be divided into B, C, D and being b, e, d, we have got.

11:23.430 --> 11:25.440
And similarly, this will be for the.

11:26.330 --> 11:27.420
Look down in Dubai.

11:27.650 --> 11:31.520
E What will be remaining and vi.

11:31.640 --> 11:34.940
E And 14 is an eight.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.420
So we have one, two, three here.

11:38.450 --> 11:40.790
Similarly, we'll have Venezia.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.280
This will break down into why a D.

11:44.190 --> 11:46.590
And this before the breakdown in the wiki.

11:47.670 --> 11:48.960
We have all six here eight.

11:49.550 --> 11:57.480
I hope are getting how am I trying to partition it where I'm trying to keep a block and figuring out

11:57.480 --> 11:59.860
the answer for the for the strength route.

12:00.240 --> 12:07.560
So when it whenever we reach on the leave not 11, one and above, we'll just add the number of is will.

12:08.160 --> 12:13.500
So in the next part, what we'll do is we'll quickly code this, but I would strongly suggest that you

12:13.500 --> 12:15.300
call it yourself because it's very easy.

12:15.820 --> 12:22.740
Eight And I hope you understood how this if three unfolds, we always have two options, either one

12:22.740 --> 12:27.180
or two, and we just need to make a check that is the one possible.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.260
Is the two possible.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.500
If both of them are not possible, not go forward, it will return zero.

12:31.650 --> 12:33.620
Otherwise we'll go forward and ask for the number of it.

12:34.700 --> 12:34.960
It.

12:35.940 --> 12:36.960
Those in the next fight.

12:37.110 --> 12:37.620
Thank you.
