WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:00.550
Okay.

00:00.630 --> 00:04.620
So let's move with the hip approach of the knapsack problem.

00:05.570 --> 00:10.760
So this thing offered a number of subjects and problem to what was happening in the subjects and problem

00:11.190 --> 00:14.650
of addressing that element or not bigoted element.

00:14.990 --> 00:20.820
It's in this problem a very similar problem to the substitution problem, because in this also we want

00:20.830 --> 00:23.390
to particular subset of the values that I have.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.880
The how can I pick up a subset of the values that I have, all the values of two options and that will

00:28.880 --> 00:32.000
come in the knapsack or they'll not come in an absolute right.

00:32.360 --> 00:35.060
So let me make a steward, which is.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.360
F coma f off.

00:40.080 --> 00:46.020
It's a XCOM away which says let's get back to the problem months.

00:46.260 --> 00:46.560
Yeah.

00:46.590 --> 00:47.970
The total maximum value.

00:49.410 --> 00:50.040
The mix.

00:50.900 --> 00:51.350
Value.

00:52.770 --> 00:54.120
From the best choice.

00:54.120 --> 00:54.420
Right?

00:54.630 --> 00:56.580
So what we'll say is the max value.

01:03.150 --> 01:03.390
Okay.

01:03.390 --> 01:05.100
Let me write it like this a.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.110
X basically the suffix of the.

01:10.390 --> 01:12.190
Items you can already prefix.

01:12.310 --> 01:12.940
It doesn't matter.

01:13.300 --> 01:19.420
I'm taking suffix here for the max value from the suffix of the items instead of eliminate items.

01:22.510 --> 01:24.070
And we're.

01:25.570 --> 01:30.580
The NAB said gap asset is why it didn't nab sick episodes.

01:33.580 --> 01:33.810
Eight.

01:34.380 --> 01:36.910
So isn't this becoming a very easy problem?

01:37.420 --> 01:43.690
What I have to do is I have to this ExxonMobil will return me the maximum value from some particular

01:43.690 --> 01:44.180
items.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.500
Right now, it is this suffix of all the item because we will be moving backwards.

01:47.500 --> 01:52.290
Or we can also see the prefix of items with an absolute capacities by right.

01:52.300 --> 01:55.060
So with the vocabulary, I want to pick up those items.

01:56.170 --> 01:57.000
But what can I do?

01:58.030 --> 01:58.690
Initially.

01:58.990 --> 02:01.780
Let me quickly write this test case here as well.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.500
We have 45 and we have

02:05.920 --> 02:12.430
18243018430.

02:13.550 --> 02:17.900
252382523.

02:17.960 --> 02:25.940
So this is the size and this is the value and this is the total value of the knapsack and the debt element.

02:26.540 --> 02:26.840
Eight.

02:27.770 --> 02:28.860
But just think about it.

02:29.180 --> 02:31.580
Let's say right now I'm on the end element.

02:31.580 --> 02:37.070
Basically, I'm just saying, tell me, what is the value of F off?

02:37.970 --> 02:38.450
Five.

02:39.390 --> 02:41.250
Because five is the last really rate.

02:41.520 --> 02:46.550
Basically what is the value of five comma this foot eight?

02:46.770 --> 02:47.700
What does this mean?

02:48.800 --> 02:53.560
At the capacity of the bag is four and model elements do I have I have.

02:55.380 --> 03:00.630
Elements from buying to five, eight, basically from the first and next to the fifth index.

03:01.680 --> 03:01.950
Eight.

03:02.700 --> 03:07.880
Five elements from fostering next to fit for the next anime were the value of a perfect five Goma foot.

03:08.400 --> 03:13.800
So what will be the value of five Goma for the thing offered in this absurd sum problem?

03:14.490 --> 03:20.490
I have two options for this fifth element because whenever we are creating some subject upsets always

03:20.490 --> 03:21.390
have two options, right?

03:21.690 --> 03:24.910
And that there will be in this absurd or they will not be in the subject.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.470
So let's see if the fifth element is.

03:29.360 --> 03:29.720
Okay.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.630
Let's say the fifth element is included in this upset.

03:33.050 --> 03:35.690
Next included because it's a01 knapsack right at it.

03:35.690 --> 03:40.100
I include it or I'll exclude it if it is included or predicts excluded.

03:42.010 --> 03:48.140
If I include the groups element in my subset in my knapsack, then what's the condition that's there?

03:48.530 --> 03:53.950
The condition is very simple that this size of the fifth element should be less than the value of the

03:54.370 --> 03:55.360
knapsack that I have.

03:56.380 --> 03:57.100
So basically.

03:58.180 --> 04:01.060
It can only be included in my knapsack if.

04:01.540 --> 04:02.650
Let me write it quickly.

04:03.070 --> 04:08.170
Size of five is less than equal to.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.100
Y, which is four.

04:10.130 --> 04:14.440
So as we can see, how is it possible that means I can included in my knapsack.

04:14.480 --> 04:20.900
So let's including men upset if I'm including a fifth in Minneapolis, then what I want from the other

04:20.900 --> 04:22.100
four items.

04:22.550 --> 04:24.020
What I want from the other four items.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.590
Tell me, what is the maximum value?

04:28.640 --> 04:29.930
From the other four elements.

04:30.520 --> 04:30.770
Right.

04:31.490 --> 04:34.070
And what will be the new value of my knapsack?

04:34.070 --> 04:37.850
Because I've included the last item in my epic.

04:38.040 --> 04:43.640
So the new value in many obstacles for minus two because I've already included it to the NAB six capacity

04:43.640 --> 04:50.300
will reduce and the NAB six capacity will be four minus two plus.

04:50.600 --> 04:54.650
What is a value that I'll get by including the last element?

04:54.710 --> 04:55.130
It is.

04:57.300 --> 05:03.420
I hope you are getting this because of Bible study because what does this African this have been written

05:03.720 --> 05:04.320
that if.

05:06.230 --> 05:08.240
This ability evolution, the maximum value rate.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.190
So we have to maintain the maximum value.

05:11.250 --> 05:17.330
So the maximum value of five gamma four can be either five will be included in my subset if all will

05:17.330 --> 05:17.990
not be included.

05:17.990 --> 05:23.900
If it is included, it is f of or gamma four minus two because the knapsack will reduce.

05:23.900 --> 05:30.380
I picked up a size, I picked up an item and the remaining elements are four and plus three because

05:30.380 --> 05:31.170
of the value.

05:31.190 --> 05:31.430
Right.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.550
And if it is excluded in my set, then what will be the value?

05:34.550 --> 05:37.400
Here it is four comma four.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.390
That means I'm not including the fifth element.

05:39.390 --> 05:43.940
Or tell me what is the best answer from four gamma four and not add anything because I've excluded it

05:43.940 --> 05:45.590
from my set i.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.400
Now again, what will happen?

05:49.410 --> 05:49.580
Now.

05:49.590 --> 05:51.160
Right now we are on the false index.

05:51.180 --> 05:54.450
That means on the fourth item, that means on this item.

05:55.890 --> 05:58.770
If I am on the item, whose side is two and.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.300
Values fail.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.310
Then what I can do is and that I can included, I excluded.

06:04.330 --> 06:07.030
So if I included the my answer will be simple.

06:07.420 --> 06:10.330
And me was the best that you can pick from three.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.980
From the remaining three items and.

06:16.670 --> 06:18.170
What the new value of the knapsack.

06:18.190 --> 06:21.280
So here it was two and I picked up an element of size two.

06:21.290 --> 06:27.620
Only then the value of my knapsack will be zero eight and plus five, because that's what I'm picking

06:27.620 --> 06:27.800
up.

06:28.340 --> 06:34.520
If I don't pick it up, that means it will be simple three comma foot by three over four.

06:34.520 --> 06:39.560
Because tell me if I'm not picking you up, tell me what the best answer from the remaining three elements

06:39.560 --> 06:39.950
and.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.300
But not for the remaining three elements and in their basic values to.

06:47.470 --> 06:54.790
And now again, the scene will be repeated for ever for Goma, that is include the four day limited

06:54.800 --> 06:56.020
to exclude the fourth element.

06:56.440 --> 07:02.890
If I include the fourth element with regard to less, I think there are two means three index minus

07:02.890 --> 07:12.220
one two because NEP six has been reduced because I'm including it and the next one will be f of three

07:12.220 --> 07:13.060
comma four.

07:13.060 --> 07:14.110
Only because.

07:15.540 --> 07:17.640
So you can see one thing is that.

07:18.060 --> 07:19.770
What does this represent?

07:20.280 --> 07:24.480
This represents the maximum value of the knapsack, if I've included.

07:25.670 --> 07:29.600
The fifth element that means included and included.

07:30.320 --> 07:36.140
This represents the value if I've included the fifth element, but excluded the fourth element, this

07:36.140 --> 07:37.610
represents the value.

07:37.610 --> 07:43.310
If I've excluded the fifth element and included the fourth element, and this represents the value in

07:43.310 --> 07:46.520
which I have excluded both the last two element.

07:49.340 --> 07:49.600
Eight.

07:49.940 --> 07:54.620
So now, guys, this thing, this particular tree can go on forever.

07:54.980 --> 07:55.760
Not forever.

07:56.150 --> 07:58.370
It can go until in zero eight.

07:59.150 --> 08:02.180
What I mean is, again, it can be 1 to 2 by trade.

08:02.630 --> 08:05.540
Included are element or not include the same included.

08:05.540 --> 08:08.920
Third element are exclude included, excluding Laura exclude and so on.

08:09.290 --> 08:16.630
But if I want to generalize it, what I can say is that f of x comma y is nothing but includes the x

08:16.640 --> 08:17.080
element.

08:18.050 --> 08:20.300
Include X element.

08:21.400 --> 08:30.520
Only if size of x which is let me right size of x should be less than equal to what they generally include

08:30.520 --> 08:30.760
in there.

08:30.970 --> 08:36.340
If knapsack doesn't have that capacity to include that element and I not included it, even including

08:36.340 --> 08:39.460
it, I'll simply ask what the remaining x minus one elements.

08:39.460 --> 08:41.020
Tell me what the.

08:42.510 --> 08:49.440
Maximum value that you can get if this are the size of my knapsack has been reduced to VI minus ISOFIX.

08:49.980 --> 08:50.330
Correct.

08:50.820 --> 08:52.530
Second is if I'm excluding it.

08:52.590 --> 08:58.830
So if I'm excluding it, tell me what's the maximum value that I can get from the remaining x minus

08:58.830 --> 08:59.390
one element?

08:59.400 --> 09:01.950
But the knapsack remains the same because I'm excluding it.

09:02.910 --> 09:08.130
This is my recursive relation that I'll get in the in the knapsack problem.

09:08.490 --> 09:10.410
And we have two options, right?

09:10.430 --> 09:13.270
So what we want to do is we want to pick up the maximum amount two.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.420
So what we'll do is we'll say maximum of.

09:16.340 --> 09:16.820
These two.

09:19.660 --> 09:27.910
So I hope this is very clear now because this can easily be coded using recursion also in.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.670
But I know it's a purely recursive solution.

09:32.670 --> 09:32.950
Right?

09:33.270 --> 09:34.260
But if I want.

09:35.990 --> 09:38.210
If I want to memorize it, I can also memorize it.

09:38.510 --> 09:40.110
Memorization is the ultimate key.

09:40.130 --> 09:43.910
We all know dynamic programming is nothing but memorization.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.010
This is recursion, pure recursion.

09:46.550 --> 09:49.910
And if I want to memorize it, what all states I have.

09:50.660 --> 09:52.610
Well, in in F of x going away.

09:52.610 --> 09:58.880
So X will start from no one late or it cannot go till zero because neither will the base case.

09:59.540 --> 10:05.060
So basically x is between zero and in and y's between.

10:05.990 --> 10:12.770
Zero and we will never let VI go below zero rate because the negative value of a knapsack doesn't make

10:12.770 --> 10:13.100
sense.

10:14.240 --> 10:21.220
So it is also 2000, which is as low and is also 2000 as is also 2000.

10:21.230 --> 10:24.470
So how many unique dates are possible here?

10:24.980 --> 10:28.850
Unique states that are possible at 2002 2000.

10:30.670 --> 10:33.770
But this is the complexity of my solution, which is and endures.

10:34.850 --> 10:40.760
So in off and endures, we can find out the best answer if we memorize it.

10:41.180 --> 10:46.090
If we don't memorize it, then you can easily realize that this trivial you know it is due to the two

10:46.100 --> 10:51.230
days to the power and in the leaf, not the day, but it will be two days to the power.

10:51.230 --> 10:53.930
2000, which is I don't know.

10:54.290 --> 10:55.190
I don't I don't know.

10:55.190 --> 10:56.110
It is too huge.

10:56.130 --> 10:58.100
8 to 2 days to go to Thailand.

10:58.310 --> 10:58.850
It will be.

10:58.850 --> 11:04.100
But if you memorize it, then the then you can you will easily see that there are some states which

11:04.100 --> 11:06.650
are repeating them, which are repeating themselves.

11:07.100 --> 11:10.340
So if they are repeating themselves, will simply written back and not calculated.

11:10.760 --> 11:13.550
So will save a lot by memorization.

11:14.450 --> 11:17.270
So in the next lecture will simply call it very easy to go.

11:17.430 --> 11:18.590
You can also try it yourself.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.570
And in the next part.

11:21.080 --> 11:21.500
Thank you.
