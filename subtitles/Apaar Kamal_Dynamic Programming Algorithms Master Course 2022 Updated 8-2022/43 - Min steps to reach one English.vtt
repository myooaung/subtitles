00:00.610 --> 00:01.320
Hello, everyone.

00:01.340 --> 00:07.900
Welcome to this problem is of one of the easiest problems you will ever see and it is called Minimum

00:07.900 --> 00:09.100
Steps to reach one.

00:10.360 --> 00:17.480
This will this problem will enhance your thinking about why you applied BP and why not to apply greedy

00:17.500 --> 00:17.590
agreed.

00:18.130 --> 00:23.410
So this is basically it tells you the very thin line between you and people dips what should be preferred

00:23.410 --> 00:27.550
because it will give the exact answer as a greedy can have many cases.

00:27.820 --> 00:34.240
I've already told you that if there are many cases like performing one step, then there are many options.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.760
Then again performing one step, then there are many options.

00:37.150 --> 00:39.430
That is not generally a greedy problem rate.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.620
That is generally a dynamic programming problem.

00:42.430 --> 00:46.120
So you have to think offered by one step at a time.

00:46.330 --> 00:46.980
You have everything.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.750
Think of just one transition, not one.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.430
And then one eight.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.190
So let me start with this problem.

00:55.190 --> 00:56.020
And it's very easy.

00:56.030 --> 01:00.620
It says that you are given a blistering deterrent and you have to reduce it to one by performing the

01:00.620 --> 01:01.340
following steps.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.440
But what I can do is I can reduce it to and minus one, which is the first step.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.380
I can divide it by two and then divide.

01:10.590 --> 01:14.220
If it is divisible by two, then I'm going divided by two divided by three.

01:14.220 --> 01:17.910
Then I then again divided by eight.

01:18.390 --> 01:19.290
Always up.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.390
Just think about this and some of you might be wondering.

01:24.020 --> 01:30.620
It is very easy, greedy problem because we can easily see that I have to go as close as to win as possible.

01:30.920 --> 01:31.150
Right?

01:31.640 --> 01:33.200
So why not?

01:33.500 --> 01:39.530
Let's apply the greedy approach that if it is divisible by three divided by three, otherwise let's

01:39.530 --> 01:40.310
divided by two.

01:40.310 --> 01:43.760
Because if I divided by three it is very close to one.

01:44.090 --> 01:46.730
Look more closer to one, then are divided by two.

01:47.030 --> 01:51.110
If 50,000 are divided by two, then let's subtract one from the last option.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.170
What if you applied this approach?

01:54.470 --> 02:00.290
Like if it is possible, do this are ways to to if it is possible otherwise do one right.

02:00.500 --> 02:01.340
But let's see.

02:01.760 --> 02:02.660
Where will it fail?

02:03.200 --> 02:10.610
Well, firstly, I would strongly suggest you deposit and try to find such cases, but of course will

02:10.610 --> 02:11.000
discuss.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.340
Let's think about a very simple question.

02:14.060 --> 02:18.710
Well, in ten, if I apply the first step that if if it is deposited better identified with three,

02:19.070 --> 02:20.150
it is not divisible by three.

02:20.150 --> 02:22.520
That means I cannot do it by three.

02:22.850 --> 02:26.690
There are only two options left, and then I'll move it to five, which is divided by two.

02:26.810 --> 02:28.610
I didn't bother to name.

02:30.370 --> 02:32.280
Now tell me what if.

02:33.550 --> 02:40.750
Okay, so right now I'm not going on the nine, but just for the sake of greedy, I'm being greedy here.

02:41.050 --> 02:44.380
So if this is not applicable, I apply this right now.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.660
Again, let's four, 5 minutes again, try the same thing.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.430
This is not applicable for fight.

02:48.490 --> 02:50.440
This is also not applicable for fight.

02:50.770 --> 02:51.910
Let's plan minus one.

02:53.510 --> 02:55.790
Full now for not applicable.

02:55.790 --> 02:56.480
Applicable.

02:57.950 --> 02:58.490
And then.

02:59.060 --> 03:00.580
But always.

03:01.190 --> 03:02.240
So how many?

03:02.270 --> 03:03.630
How much did it take?

03:03.650 --> 03:05.870
It took one plus one plus one plus one.

03:05.870 --> 03:07.900
One, two, three, four, four steps.

03:07.920 --> 03:12.850
They have to perform these steps four times in which and convert it to one.

03:13.220 --> 03:13.630
It is.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.300
Is it the best but naught eight.

03:16.520 --> 03:16.890
Why?

03:17.240 --> 03:20.330
Because instead of dividing ten by.

03:21.790 --> 03:22.030
Two.

03:22.180 --> 03:26.710
What I could have done is I could have reduce it to nine and then nine could have directly given me

03:26.710 --> 03:29.410
three and then trigger regularly me giving me one.

03:30.250 --> 03:34.600
So you can see there were four steps involved, but right now you can easily see that there is only

03:35.050 --> 03:36.630
three steps in it.

03:37.010 --> 03:42.700
So creative won't work here if it is the way to do it, but we know that it will not work.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.530
What happens in that in programming?

03:44.530 --> 03:50.410
What we do is we try all the possibilities and choose the best when it is not even programming great.

03:51.700 --> 03:54.820
So it's you can also take on other examples.

03:55.030 --> 03:57.960
I would suggest to you an example of wrongdoing, right?

03:58.000 --> 04:01.090
The example of 21 and 33.

04:01.720 --> 04:06.640
These are some good examples, but I hope you understood the problem in vivo integrity work here.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.370
So how to approach it using dynamic programming?

04:09.790 --> 04:10.370
Very simple.

04:10.930 --> 04:16.330
We just have to worry about ourself and just ask the others that you tell me your best.

04:16.840 --> 04:17.770
I won't do it.

04:17.770 --> 04:18.880
And that will be my best.

04:19.180 --> 04:19.400
Right.

04:19.690 --> 04:24.370
But basically what it means is that effen is equal to nothing but.

04:25.610 --> 04:26.670
If it is resolved.

04:26.810 --> 04:27.970
Two I will.

04:28.310 --> 04:28.550
Okay.

04:28.570 --> 04:31.430
If it is diesel rotary assembly c, f and military.

04:31.430 --> 04:32.660
Give me your best answer.

04:32.690 --> 04:33.200
What is f?

04:33.800 --> 04:36.870
F is telling the minimum steps to one h.

04:36.870 --> 04:38.780
So when it reaches one, it gives me zero.

04:39.260 --> 04:39.520
Well.

04:41.730 --> 04:43.910
Otherwise this isn't three.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.680
Otherwise I'll say okay, not otherwise.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.680
I will also ask and do it.

04:49.680 --> 04:49.930
Okay.

04:49.950 --> 04:51.240
You'll give me your best answer.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.640
I won't do it that again.

04:53.790 --> 04:59.070
I perform one step from going from end to end by to and by to give me this answer wherever it returns

04:59.070 --> 04:59.310
me.

04:59.550 --> 05:00.450
And I won't do it.

05:00.750 --> 05:01.560
And what is the third?

05:01.560 --> 05:02.190
One third.

05:02.220 --> 05:05.100
When it's nothing but f over and minus one contains everything.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.330
Minus one can be the best.

05:06.510 --> 05:13.050
But as we have seen in the case of ten eight, either displacement or whatever is written from all these

05:13.050 --> 05:15.210
three, I take the minimum and it and plus one.

05:16.380 --> 05:17.050
Very direct.

05:17.580 --> 05:24.900
But to let me just analyze it, it says it is equal to a minimum of F and by three, if it is raised

05:24.900 --> 05:28.470
by three plus F and by two, if it is neutral by two.

05:29.610 --> 05:30.390
Not plus.

05:34.430 --> 05:37.400
Eight RF and minus one if nothing.

05:38.810 --> 05:42.260
And finally, plus one because I performed a step here.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.870
Well, this I hope this is very clear.

05:46.020 --> 05:47.580
And this is a very simple problem.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.110
We all can easily solve it.

05:49.470 --> 05:52.770
We all can easily see how it's working.

05:53.310 --> 05:58.170
And if you want me to call it, I can also call it and I can go to you within a minute as well.

05:59.340 --> 06:01.280
Let's start it real quick.

06:03.690 --> 06:03.890
They?

06:05.690 --> 06:08.350
And I hope you can apply the memorization.

06:08.870 --> 06:09.960
It's what I do.

06:10.280 --> 06:10.570
If.

06:11.950 --> 06:12.210
Well.

06:13.620 --> 06:14.210
Instead of it.

06:14.220 --> 06:15.710
I generally prefer it's a.

06:16.820 --> 06:18.680
And B it will dig in.

06:18.690 --> 06:19.940
And what will this do?

06:20.540 --> 06:20.960
Nothing.

06:20.960 --> 06:21.740
It will just see.

06:23.840 --> 06:31.400
Um, well let's say to it's said to be let's say minus.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.060
But it has three parts.

06:35.350 --> 06:38.320
Who or what is true here?

06:38.410 --> 06:39.370
Two is nothing but.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.590
I have to apply those checks has been made so far into.

06:46.550 --> 06:48.170
It's the answer is in the mix.

06:48.790 --> 06:53.240
Initially, let's let's take it as a very big value and we simply say there noncitizen an adequate minimum

06:53.240 --> 06:56.660
upon said Obama if it is reasonable to convert.

06:56.660 --> 06:56.950
Right.

06:56.970 --> 06:58.790
So let me just write the case here.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.420
There are so many cases.

07:05.770 --> 07:07.030
And here we come.

07:07.030 --> 07:07.420
And we're.

07:08.230 --> 07:08.510
Well.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.150
Similarly welcome foreign.

07:10.150 --> 07:10.900
But we.

07:12.180 --> 07:18.390
If it is a diesel battery, just go for and battery and give me the answer.

07:19.420 --> 07:21.610
Well, foreign word to give me the answer.

07:22.000 --> 07:22.780
And of course.

07:24.790 --> 07:26.530
The last one, which is nothing but.

07:28.620 --> 07:29.760
Fourth and minus.

07:30.360 --> 07:35.430
When I return, the answer and what will be on base case whenever I reach one.

07:36.380 --> 07:39.980
If end is one then simply written zero.

07:40.420 --> 07:47.690
We we've already released one and we can easily apply memorization gates when we do applied it, we

07:47.690 --> 07:48.020
apply.

07:49.900 --> 07:50.800
Eagle Getty.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.960
It's a memo in.

07:54.190 --> 08:00.480
And if a more and not equal to minus one point.

08:00.700 --> 08:01.090
Okay.

08:01.660 --> 08:08.860
So let me tell you a very good new way of memorization and it's very interesting thought you can do

08:08.860 --> 08:11.980
is you can call memo in.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.980
With a variable name called Answer.

08:16.820 --> 08:22.310
Basically what you're doing is answer is nothing but memoir, and only it is actually pointing to the

08:22.310 --> 08:23.110
address of memoir.

08:23.150 --> 08:29.030
And so if it is pointing to the address of my win, if anything changes in the answer will change in

08:29.030 --> 08:31.700
the memoir in because it is directly changing in the.

08:33.090 --> 08:34.590
Address offered eight.

08:35.010 --> 08:37.770
It's not a variable and it's not copying something.

08:37.770 --> 08:39.150
It's copying the whole address.

08:39.630 --> 08:44.730
And if you're describing the address, whatever changes in answer will also change in memory.

08:45.520 --> 08:46.990
So what else is answered?

08:46.990 --> 08:53.550
It goes to remember when initially, if answer is not equal to minus, when you're done, answer don't

08:53.550 --> 08:54.110
get confused.

08:54.270 --> 08:57.630
I'm just telling you a new way because I knew it and I thought, I'll share.

08:58.020 --> 09:02.850
It's fine if you go as the old way as well, but you can also learn this in this.

09:03.390 --> 09:07.110
Now we don't have to write memo when it goes to answer read by because.

09:08.940 --> 09:11.650
Onset is nothing but memoir in nature.

09:11.730 --> 09:13.230
Instead of writing my when again and again.

09:13.230 --> 09:13.980
What I've done is.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.220
I've just taken another variable.

09:18.250 --> 09:23.110
Basically, it's a nickname for my moon rate and I'm using their nickname and it's doing the work.

09:23.610 --> 09:28.720
Well, this is one of the easiest ways in which you can add memory and you don't have to worry about

09:28.720 --> 09:29.530
saving your data.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.060
I hope this is very clear.

09:32.540 --> 09:34.250
And in the next part then.

09:35.890 --> 09:36.280
Okay.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.570
Did I miss something?

09:38.050 --> 09:39.070
Okay, I missed this.

09:39.820 --> 09:41.510
And there's one more thing that I missed.

09:41.530 --> 09:44.890
I did not initialize this member minus one.

09:46.910 --> 09:47.820
Um.

09:56.320 --> 09:56.680
Okay.

09:57.370 --> 09:59.140
Another things that I missed, which is.

10:02.950 --> 10:03.220
Yeah.

10:04.060 --> 10:06.120
I thought I just finished in a hurry, but.

10:06.130 --> 10:06.400
No.

10:08.130 --> 10:11.670
Because penalties are far too many things.

10:11.670 --> 10:12.360
But when I.

10:13.330 --> 10:21.150
Myself I am sitting in the I don't take big variables my take just small variables but sometimes if

10:21.190 --> 10:21.460
said it.

10:23.650 --> 10:23.940
Right.

10:24.070 --> 10:29.440
So if it is not this, the right word will take its vintage, initialize it to intermix, will make

10:29.440 --> 10:33.280
it very huge and then we can find the answer.

10:33.740 --> 10:37.120
So if we didn't do, if we go to one, it will admit zero.

10:37.390 --> 10:42.610
Otherwise, whatever minimum I'm getting from all three, it will tell me that.

10:42.610 --> 10:44.860
And simply what I'll do is I'll add one to it.

10:45.890 --> 10:47.930
On the plus equals two, right?

10:48.860 --> 10:49.160
Eight.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.380
It's a we got three from ten.

10:52.130 --> 10:53.840
I hope this is very clear.

10:53.870 --> 10:59.480
I know there are some things that I missed and just about going this because of going in a little hurry.

11:00.790 --> 11:01.840
It's a debate case.

11:02.530 --> 11:03.430
This is important, guys.

11:03.430 --> 11:07.060
You need to make it to a very big venue because we are taking some minimum.

11:07.060 --> 11:14.020
You say you're taking minimum of already be entitled to a very big value and whatever is the minimum

11:14.020 --> 11:14.620
will come here.

11:15.190 --> 11:20.140
And finally, don't forget to rate plus one because this is our transition happening and we have to

11:20.140 --> 11:23.950
take the transition in account and the answer and.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.070
