00:00.640 --> 00:01.300
Hello, everyone.

00:01.510 --> 00:02.080
Welcome.

00:02.590 --> 00:05.470
And now we will solve this problem called magic number.

00:06.070 --> 00:08.800
Also, I've shared with you a list of problems.

00:08.890 --> 00:11.320
It might actually take a lot of time to solve.

00:11.650 --> 00:13.990
But if you want to master this digital.

00:15.080 --> 00:20.330
Then it's recommended that you solve all the problems that I'm sure you will.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.460
It is in the last lecture of the current Section eight.

00:24.910 --> 00:30.010
I'm just solving two or three problems so that you get an idea and how to move on with the digital problems.

00:30.610 --> 00:36.430
And after that I just need to give some retry to the problem that there have been.

00:37.570 --> 00:37.990
And.

00:39.130 --> 00:41.350
Just just go after the problems.

00:42.520 --> 00:46.950
You do problems all day and then if you do it.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.340
So let's do this problem.

00:49.370 --> 00:50.030
Magic number.

00:50.030 --> 00:55.240
This is from educational code forces around it and it's really nice problem.

00:55.790 --> 00:58.700
It's a deep problem of 2200 Tech eight.

00:59.030 --> 01:00.830
But now we all know how to solve this problem.

01:00.830 --> 01:02.570
It's a very, very easy problem for us.

01:02.990 --> 01:03.260
Just.

01:03.260 --> 01:04.400
Just remember one thing.

01:05.620 --> 01:05.800
Yes.

01:05.810 --> 01:07.420
Remember District eight?

01:07.960 --> 01:14.400
From where to from where we start, what all we need and what extra variables that we need to figure

01:14.410 --> 01:17.590
out that it's a correct path or not.

01:17.590 --> 01:17.890
Right.

01:17.950 --> 01:20.380
That means if I from the correct interrupt.

01:20.650 --> 01:22.330
Okay, so let's do this.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.940
Consider the decimal representation of an integer.

01:24.940 --> 01:32.290
Let's call a number the magic if it should be appears in the decimal presentation of the number on even

01:32.290 --> 01:34.000
position and no variance.

01:35.010 --> 01:35.340
Cool.

01:35.370 --> 01:37.390
So this is important.

01:37.800 --> 01:43.230
Note that the number, the digit date would only be on the even position.

01:43.590 --> 01:48.770
So right now here we have seen their starting 112, three, five, seven, eight.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.480
They are digits starting from one.

01:52.690 --> 01:55.210
So on this conversation, we have seven Ford pushing.

01:55.210 --> 01:57.160
We have seven six push and we have seven.

01:57.490 --> 01:58.930
This is a seven magic number.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.060
This is also seven magic number.

02:01.570 --> 02:03.520
And this is also said magic number because.

02:05.570 --> 02:06.610
There's no even abortion.

02:06.620 --> 02:08.060
So it doesn't matter now.

02:08.660 --> 02:09.790
But just remember this.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.660
The second part here is also important.

02:11.790 --> 02:14.810
Generally, people miss this, that it should not be anyway.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.010
It is not.

02:16.250 --> 02:22.160
It is saying that that they should be on this on the even indexes, but it should not also be anywhere

02:22.160 --> 02:24.230
else, even on the all indexes.

02:24.230 --> 02:28.640
Here we can see one, two, three, four, seven, eight.

02:30.540 --> 02:36.390
You find the number of the magic numbers in this segment, A to B that are multiples of him.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.950
So he just added one more thing.

02:38.490 --> 02:43.860
So instead of just finding the magic numbers, what we also have to find we have to find the numbers

02:43.860 --> 02:44.700
are multiples of him.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.320
And we've already seen this rate.

02:46.340 --> 02:52.530
How to find when when I'm moving digit by digit, I'm making numbers digit by digit like me.

02:52.530 --> 02:52.740
Right.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.790
Let's say I'm making this number 159 17.

02:57.060 --> 02:59.920
I want to find out whether it is divisible by seven or not.

02:59.970 --> 03:07.140
Then what I do is when I'm on digit one, I just multiplied by ten at five and again multiplied by ten

03:07.380 --> 03:08.670
and nine.

03:08.670 --> 03:09.480
We all know this, right?

03:09.510 --> 03:13.890
We have already seen this in one of the previous problems multiplied by ten at seven.

03:14.890 --> 03:15.250
And then.

03:15.250 --> 03:15.790
Totally.

03:16.730 --> 03:17.270
Oh, yeah.

03:17.510 --> 03:18.320
Multiplied by ten.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.920
And it hit it.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.500
What will this give me?

03:21.740 --> 03:22.190
It is.

03:23.300 --> 03:27.890
This is being done into ten bus, nine into ten BA 708.

03:28.190 --> 03:35.900
And what will do is in an individual steps will just ignored by seven if total mod by seven is zero.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.770
That means it is divisible by seven.

03:38.920 --> 03:39.850
We have already seen that.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.110
We have already carried this out.

03:42.730 --> 03:44.920
But that shouldn't be an issue now.

03:45.130 --> 03:47.500
He says that answer can be very huge.

03:47.530 --> 03:49.330
You should only find its value.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.510
Modulo ten is to the my plus seven.

03:52.090 --> 03:53.800
Why will the answers be very huge?

03:54.790 --> 03:57.220
Let's say the numbers are if A and B.

03:58.240 --> 03:58.680
I'd.

03:59.690 --> 04:01.210
Less than dentists two night.

04:01.430 --> 04:04.460
Nonsense cannot be huge rated because the range is small to the numbers.

04:04.460 --> 04:06.560
But India Ranges will of course be small.

04:06.950 --> 04:11.870
But here we can see that E is less than equal to the number of digits in a and.

04:12.830 --> 04:13.520
It doesn't matter.

04:13.910 --> 04:15.800
And don't exceed 2000.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.090
But this is important.

04:17.990 --> 04:20.480
He's not saying that the number doesn't increase 2000.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.980
It is not saying this.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.090
This is wrong, right?

04:25.140 --> 04:28.320
It is seeing the number of digits in and which does not exceed total.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.390
It means E and B are less cynical.

04:32.390 --> 04:34.280
Do tend to devour 2000.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.060
I hope this is clear.

04:37.330 --> 04:39.490
I hope now you'll understand.

04:39.490 --> 04:45.190
And via big numbers and strings to this this number as a digit in 2008.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.320
That's why I can't take it as an integer.

04:47.440 --> 04:47.740
Right.

04:48.070 --> 04:51.190
I have to take this number as a string and then formulate my.

04:52.410 --> 04:52.610
Well.

04:53.590 --> 04:54.840
Let's get back to John.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.240
So let's get back to the problem.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.920
And yeah, this is very easy.

05:00.180 --> 05:01.740
Modular Danish by number seven.

05:02.340 --> 05:07.910
We all know how to do this when we are calculating the answer in this stick modulus nothing is eight

05:08.340 --> 05:09.360
because the number is going to be huge.

05:09.360 --> 05:14.400
So we will take mod also we have to take this mod which is the number should be a multiple of and it

05:14.400 --> 05:15.210
should be diesel by.

05:16.020 --> 05:18.060
And this is also important.

05:19.080 --> 05:19.740
And.

05:22.930 --> 05:23.320
Okay.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.350
Anything else that we're missing here?

05:28.230 --> 05:29.340
No, I don't think so.

05:29.640 --> 05:33.810
Wait, so it scored this problem and then.

05:35.410 --> 05:35.680
With.

05:38.090 --> 05:41.750
Hope some of you might be thinking like what else is required in this program?

05:41.750 --> 05:47.540
So as we know, what we do is whenever we start start finding something, then we try to index it past

05:47.540 --> 05:48.500
the index, of course.

05:48.980 --> 05:49.430
And then.

05:50.420 --> 05:58.430
We pass this very broad loss, which kind of is a flag so that it doesn't exceed the last range of the

05:58.430 --> 05:58.730
tree.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.710
You already discussed it.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.280
This is the most important part last.

06:01.820 --> 06:02.990
And what is the third thing?

06:03.450 --> 06:05.750
Third thing is what we need in the problem.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.540
He's saying that the number should be a multiple of them.

06:08.570 --> 06:09.740
So we need to keep.

06:11.030 --> 06:11.980
Marred by two.

06:12.020 --> 06:14.840
Let's call it some mud or let's just call it mud.

06:16.190 --> 06:16.450
Eight.

06:17.870 --> 06:22.580
So it is this more or less will finally tell me whether the numbers do sell by and what not because

06:22.580 --> 06:24.410
we are keeping more individual steps.

06:24.530 --> 06:26.300
And is there anything else that we need to keep?

06:26.990 --> 06:27.320
Yes.

06:27.350 --> 06:27.890
By magic.

06:27.890 --> 06:28.190
Right.

06:29.230 --> 06:32.980
But you're saying that there isn't a similar number on human positions.

06:32.980 --> 06:33.210
Right.

06:33.220 --> 06:33.960
And nowhere else.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.030
So you don't have to give anything here.

06:37.060 --> 06:39.970
What we can simply do is if index is hard.

06:41.590 --> 06:43.480
If the index is art.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.130
Then what to do?

06:46.150 --> 06:49.690
Place all the digits except the eight.

06:50.230 --> 06:58.690
Don't place the place or otherwise if let's say else if index is even in place already and move forward

06:59.190 --> 06:59.830
in rate.

07:00.400 --> 07:08.410
Now they just one tricky thing in this I will not tell you now because when will coordinate and will

07:08.410 --> 07:09.310
try to understand it.

07:09.940 --> 07:15.580
But I but what I suggest is you're possible you try this problem yourself, you call it out and then

07:15.580 --> 07:17.250
come back to the solution.

07:18.550 --> 07:22.120
So let's go to this in the next video and given.
