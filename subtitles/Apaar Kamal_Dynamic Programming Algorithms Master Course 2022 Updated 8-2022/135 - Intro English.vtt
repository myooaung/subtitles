Hello everyone.

00:01.560 --> 00:03.420
Welcome to the Debian graph section.

00:03.960 --> 00:07.770
So firstly you do understand how to apply dynamic programming on graphs.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.310
We first need to understand what are the F-Series?

00:12.520 --> 00:13.210
The FSG.

00:14.140 --> 00:15.640
What our baggage is.

00:18.450 --> 00:24.180
So to understand these two very special, very important topics, because these are actually very important

00:24.180 --> 00:31.050
topics because if you don't if you don't try to go deeper into the idea of history, then and back ages,

00:31.260 --> 00:35.940
you can never understand how to apply dynamic programming on graphs, but to apply deep on graphs.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.310
What we have to do is we have to first converted graph to a three.

00:39.810 --> 00:41.530
We have to convert the graph to a tree.

00:42.150 --> 00:47.490
So when I convert the graph to a tree, there will be some edges which are actually not part of the

00:47.970 --> 00:50.430
tree because the tree has only and means when they are just right.

00:50.580 --> 00:52.680
So m minus and minus one edges.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.480
M is a number of edges in my graph.

00:55.080 --> 00:58.170
These are this will not be a part of my current tree nature.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.340
Those will be the best edges.

01:00.260 --> 01:00.530
Good.

01:00.770 --> 01:06.290
So just giving her a very small introduction, just just telling you on why we need to understand the

01:06.290 --> 01:07.490
offseason packages.

01:08.210 --> 01:10.280
Because we understand this.

01:10.280 --> 01:15.650
Then we will use both of them and apply to find out articulation points.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.140
Articulation points and bridges.

01:19.490 --> 01:21.440
And bridges in the graph.

01:22.010 --> 01:25.670
It will apply the knowledge of the first reason packages.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.540
Find out how to figure out articulation, points and bridges in the graph and this link finding out

01:31.550 --> 01:32.750
articulation points in bridges.

01:32.750 --> 01:37.490
We need two very special terms which are called lowest time.

01:37.910 --> 01:41.510
You will see that in the upcoming videos and the discovery time.

01:42.450 --> 01:45.180
All of this has been explained in the upcoming lectures.

01:46.050 --> 01:51.390
So to find out this Lewis name and the Discovery time, what we want is we want we have to apply dynamic

01:51.390 --> 01:53.080
programming in this way.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.740
So this is solvable only using dynamic programming.

01:56.550 --> 02:00.510
So so let me just tell you how out of this section go.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.990
The section starts from the industries goes to packages.

02:04.410 --> 02:08.730
Using both of them, we figure out what is the lowest time, what is the discovery time?

02:08.760 --> 02:09.690
And then using.

02:10.620 --> 02:16.140
Yeah, because this Lewis time is actually calculated using dynamic programming right there.

02:16.140 --> 02:18.660
You will understand how to apply dynamic programming on graphs.

02:19.050 --> 02:23.030
And after that, after we have figured out Lewis timing discovery, then we'll figure out how to find

02:23.040 --> 02:27.450
out articulation, points and bridges in the graph, which is a very, very important topic.

02:27.960 --> 02:28.210
They.

02:29.270 --> 02:31.760
So I hope you enjoy this section.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.320
And yeah, one more thing.

02:33.530 --> 02:39.440
I haven't made fresh videos of that because I already had some videos on defense on the freeze back

02:39.440 --> 02:42.590
edges, articulation points and bridges by Barrett de Graph.

02:44.390 --> 02:46.430
So I have this course which is called graph 2D.

02:47.390 --> 02:51.020
Similarly, like this dynamic programming goes, we have this graph activity goals as well.

02:51.470 --> 02:57.890
So from Degrassi because I have just picked up a few videos and edited them in the below section and

02:57.890 --> 03:02.060
after that, after you understood the history is back added articulation points and bridges, these

03:02.060 --> 03:04.150
timings and reviewing graphs.

03:04.180 --> 03:09.020
Then we will talk some more problems on Libyan graphs and.

03:10.380 --> 03:11.480
So I hope you like it.

03:11.750 --> 03:12.140
Thank you.
