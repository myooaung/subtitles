WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:00.570
Yep.

00:00.690 --> 00:01.700
So let's good.

00:01.830 --> 00:03.990
This recursive relation that we have formed here.

00:04.380 --> 00:09.810
And believe me, it's the easiest thing to do because we have been already coding recursion from a very

00:09.810 --> 00:10.290
long time.

00:11.520 --> 00:11.820
So.

00:12.930 --> 00:17.580
The only thing that we need to do is we need to just understand how to move down on tree.

00:17.730 --> 00:20.400
And that is also very easy and just normal.

00:21.360 --> 00:21.630
Yeah.

00:21.870 --> 00:23.490
So let me quickly.

00:25.000 --> 00:25.450
Okay.

00:25.750 --> 00:31.360
Let me quickly take this graph, this tree as an input, right?

00:31.720 --> 00:37.420
So maybe for some of you it might be new for those who have done the graph algorithm scores or those

00:37.420 --> 00:42.880
who are actually doing epi for them, this will be the right, you understand?

00:42.880 --> 00:44.230
How am I taking this input?

00:44.650 --> 00:45.760
This is one in five plus one.

00:45.760 --> 00:49.030
Let's take it plus one because one based indexing.

00:50.060 --> 00:55.100
And what we do is we take we take this vector.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.510
Eddie and let's call it in.

00:58.510 --> 01:01.240
And in this world, really just push the edges into the list.

01:02.050 --> 01:04.090
Actually, I'm feeling guilty of, you know.

01:05.670 --> 01:07.050
Not explaining this, but.

01:08.010 --> 01:09.990
This is a dynamic program.

01:10.620 --> 01:11.210
All right.

01:11.220 --> 01:13.680
I've explained all of this in the.

01:14.900 --> 01:15.920
Get off to Texas.

01:17.460 --> 01:24.300
And also it's very easy to understand the edges so and in adjacency list of X let's push back.

01:25.250 --> 01:28.080
By an adjacency list of why.

01:28.110 --> 01:28.940
Let's push back.

01:32.210 --> 01:32.440
It.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.370
So this is normal.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.340
Three that are.

01:39.590 --> 01:40.150
Input.

01:40.160 --> 01:44.450
And so what I do is I see out nothing but deep.

01:45.550 --> 01:46.810
So what are we making?

01:46.810 --> 01:47.230
A rude note.

01:47.230 --> 01:51.540
We can make any of the notes that general ladies go to make one as it rule.

01:51.550 --> 01:59.230
Not because it's easy to understand sometimes when we try to make a tree, when we write it on the copy

01:59.230 --> 02:02.170
and understand it, and we generally start with one, right?

02:02.470 --> 02:05.990
So I'm just thinking, when is the rule not but it won't matter.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.010
You can also take two and go until.

02:08.040 --> 02:08.830
And it.

02:09.100 --> 02:14.320
What I'll do is say the minimum of the b10 comma DP one one.

02:14.590 --> 02:15.550
That means include.

02:15.550 --> 02:18.590
When I don't include one, I'm starting from one.

02:18.610 --> 02:24.610
That means on my DFS, my DP might occasionally start from one and it will be automatically consider

02:24.610 --> 02:28.900
the rule note of the poultry it went into.

02:28.900 --> 02:37.240
DP of DFS Limited DP here, but it is the only thing is incorrect and this is a boolean.

02:38.420 --> 02:39.950
Which is or not.

02:41.600 --> 02:41.900
So.

02:43.210 --> 02:47.440
And also they were moulting when we performed deep entries.

02:47.440 --> 02:53.200
We can just pass the third single parent so that we just move downwards in the direction.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.060
Don't go upwards.

02:55.150 --> 02:59.680
So let me just pass a third value, which is minus one initially, because if one is a rule, none of

02:59.680 --> 03:01.030
the three doesn't have a parent.

03:01.120 --> 03:06.970
So I just pass minus one does anything but some trip fixed or, you know, go over into the office.

03:08.590 --> 03:11.620
So what I'll do is I simply say I'll iterate over all the.

03:13.980 --> 03:19.410
I'd simply trade over all the values and all the additions list of the current node.

03:20.130 --> 03:24.750
And I would say if X is not equal to pairing, that means it is not the pairing.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.630
Note That means now I'm talking about only.

03:28.010 --> 03:28.460
Childhood.

03:28.770 --> 03:29.780
I still hear.

03:30.670 --> 03:33.240
X is only the.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.050
Not.

03:36.120 --> 03:36.280
Eight.

03:36.810 --> 03:37.630
I live vertex.

03:39.050 --> 03:40.040
This is normally a visit.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.660
We're doing more dances.

03:42.350 --> 03:42.620
Yeah.

03:43.530 --> 03:46.860
They are two things that I including it or I'm not including it.

03:47.610 --> 03:51.660
So let's take a BP Eddie.

03:52.430 --> 03:58.430
And let's make enough doses of the Pfizer and DPA zero and DPA.

03:59.930 --> 04:01.490
So let's make the best cases.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.840
The best case is nothing but.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.960
Any note, if I'm not including it.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.480
The Pickering zero is nothing but zero eight.

04:10.990 --> 04:18.010
And okay, so the first thing is that I have already used a boolean area which is take eight.

04:18.280 --> 04:20.380
So instead of zero, let me write it.

04:21.730 --> 04:27.400
And here what I can say is they wyomissing they did because a symbol, right?

04:27.880 --> 04:28.870
Let's say it is a leaf.

04:29.110 --> 04:33.880
And what happens in the leave, not this fall, will not one swallow villain, but we will never go

04:33.880 --> 04:38.530
inside this if case ranked because lethal does not have a chain.

04:39.130 --> 04:46.930
And here what I simply do that simply returned BP current pick it so but in the base because he's you

04:46.930 --> 04:51.640
going to you know have this basically right if or deviant rates because we know the base case is nothing

04:51.640 --> 04:54.890
where they leave note and for the leave not will never going this far.

04:54.940 --> 05:01.150
Look there will be no other day because of whatever it is stored over here will be written they if for

05:01.150 --> 05:03.700
any leaf not if I'm not taking it, it will be zero.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.610
If I'm digging it, it will be one full.

05:06.670 --> 05:07.750
So that's what we wanted.

05:10.120 --> 05:14.470
Now let's go over this for a loop and let's do a DFS.

05:14.470 --> 05:16.720
So what I would simply say is if.

05:17.540 --> 05:17.990
Take.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.660
That's right.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.560
There are other ways to call it also.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.300
I hear all the ways.

05:25.570 --> 05:27.520
Maybe we can use the other way to put it.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.890
But let me quickly go this one less.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.790
If I'm taking it, that means the current.

05:35.370 --> 05:37.900
That means this one, it be cut in one eye.

05:38.310 --> 05:42.150
This one has already been added over here because I'm taking it.

05:43.080 --> 05:46.740
And now what I have to do is nothing but some for the minimum of.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.880
Okay, let me summit.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.130
I'll simply say to be current is nothing.

05:50.130 --> 05:58.740
But the current take is nothing but minimum of epi x.

06:01.220 --> 06:01.840
I figured.

06:02.950 --> 06:03.290
Yeah.

06:03.310 --> 06:10.140
So instead of, you know, writing DP X Comma Zero this way, what I can do is I can call it also eight.

06:10.210 --> 06:14.650
So I can simply say and just tell me what is the it'd be a comma zero.

06:15.710 --> 06:18.830
I'm not taking it and the current becomes the parent of X.

06:19.550 --> 06:25.760
There are some few things that might confuse you because if you're if you don't know the DFS rate,

06:25.970 --> 06:32.670
otherwise, the second guess will be if I'm taking the high note and still carrying this, my parents,

06:33.050 --> 06:37.720
whatever the minimum of them, I simply add them in my typical rate.

06:37.970 --> 06:39.800
And what the second case if I am.

06:40.900 --> 06:41.260
Okay.

06:41.890 --> 06:42.160
Okay.

06:42.160 --> 06:42.530
Sorry.

06:42.550 --> 06:43.690
Yeah, this is.

06:44.660 --> 06:52.580
This should come over here and this should come here because they think if they get one, then this

06:52.580 --> 06:53.090
will happen.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.150
If there is zero, then what will happen?

06:56.200 --> 07:00.130
I'd simply say, tell me minimum of BP.

07:04.110 --> 07:05.710
But it's not many movement this time.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.440
It just a summation of deep explain.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.990
So let me just back.

07:10.650 --> 07:12.900
It is simply X comma, one comma.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.230
But it will be the symbolism.

07:16.230 --> 07:16.500
Right.

07:16.860 --> 07:19.070
And also these we don't have to take this in.

07:19.140 --> 07:25.530
We don't have to take this out in this particular exam, particular code, because this can also be

07:25.530 --> 07:29.100
sorted using by just taking a variable could answer it.

07:29.370 --> 07:30.900
Let me just take a variable answer.

07:32.700 --> 07:33.090
And.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.090
It's the same technique and I submit it and the answer.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.610
Well, so this is normal recursion.

07:39.970 --> 07:42.130
I haven't applied the bee to it.

07:42.700 --> 07:43.900
That is memorization.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.730
But this is normal recursion.

07:46.630 --> 07:51.640
And this will take a huge complexity because for any node, there will be multiple calls happening.

07:52.690 --> 07:54.640
Of course I am doing our DFS, but.

07:56.550 --> 08:01.500
This is not an open solution right now because this is normally coordinated.

08:02.010 --> 08:06.180
I will travel down the aisle, come up again, travel down the tree and then come up.

08:06.180 --> 08:07.410
Then again, travel down the track.

08:07.740 --> 08:11.240
Because I'm not memories do well so wisely.

08:11.250 --> 08:16.100
Let me just build it so that we can see if we are getting any answers.

08:16.110 --> 08:16.470
Okay.

08:17.250 --> 08:18.990
Yeah, let me remove the area.

08:18.990 --> 08:19.620
We don't need it.

08:19.650 --> 08:20.490
This is normal to go.

08:21.990 --> 08:22.380
Oh, here.

08:22.380 --> 08:23.970
You can see we have one for this.

08:25.010 --> 08:30.920
And for my tree, which is let me make my own tree, which is seven nodes.

08:32.690 --> 08:34.790
One, two, one, three.

08:35.030 --> 08:38.990
One, four, two five, three, six, four.

08:39.980 --> 08:40.820
Seven eight.

08:42.950 --> 08:43.240
Yeah.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.980
So here we see the dance industry.

08:45.880 --> 08:51.440
Well, and now what can happen is I can just use memorization to memorize it.

08:52.470 --> 08:55.760
But what I would simply say is if.

08:56.720 --> 08:57.050
Okay.

08:58.370 --> 09:05.660
If my more current IG is not a gold mine isn't here, parent is not the independent variable rate,

09:05.810 --> 09:10.670
but any nordex parent is only one in the duty rate that can be written.

09:10.670 --> 09:12.410
Memo current.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.260
Think this is more of a deep regret.

09:16.260 --> 09:16.820
I've gotten it.

09:16.830 --> 09:21.900
And after this, I will call more of a DFS approach, which will.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.470
Which is also good to learn.

09:25.730 --> 09:28.310
And finally, what I'll do is I simply.

09:29.710 --> 09:30.410
You might.

09:31.720 --> 09:36.580
And before moving on, I just have to make this memo to B minus one.

09:38.300 --> 09:41.780
Ma'am said my move minus one side of.

09:43.330 --> 09:48.790
Later in the next part, what we'll do is we'll call more of our DFS approach to this is a more of a

09:48.790 --> 09:53.860
deep approach and you have to be willing to be, but it will be a different way of using.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.350
DP okay.

09:57.620 --> 09:59.280
So that that was it, guys.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.000
I hope this is very clear to all of us.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.190
And let's meet you in the next part.

10:05.600 --> 10:05.990
Thank you.
