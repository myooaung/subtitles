WEBVTT

00:00.530 --> 00:00.860
I will.

00:01.220 --> 00:03.050
Let's go to this problem and.

00:04.520 --> 00:11.870
I've already taken the input, which is I already pasted the input here and initialized we have taken

00:11.870 --> 00:18.260
the and as an input then I have discussed electric crossing but we know it will be at cross entry because

00:18.260 --> 00:19.790
and are the houses that we have.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.270
And I have taken this at a as an input.

00:23.270 --> 00:29.750
So firstly I feel the first two because that's how will take the input and the secondary then the hydro

00:30.080 --> 00:30.300
pool.

00:30.560 --> 00:34.880
So for all the colours, for all the houses, now I have deep tree crossing.

00:35.840 --> 00:43.550
And in these related infinity base cases, b00 is nothing but a cost of 008.

00:44.120 --> 00:52.380
That means for the zero column eight, all of the values for all the colors will be same for the first

00:52.380 --> 00:52.610
tops.

00:53.350 --> 00:56.540
Well, these are the base cases that of your.

00:56.870 --> 01:01.250
And now let's get rid from the second column.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.760
I generally take D four to be a column eight.

01:04.760 --> 01:12.980
So I just start G from one and G will go to basically JS iterating over all the houses and I will now

01:12.980 --> 01:18.750
be iterating over all the colors because I generally use it as a row variable full.

01:19.190 --> 01:21.410
So in this case, what we'll have is.

01:22.460 --> 01:22.810
Okay.

01:22.820 --> 01:30.150
So before me, before, you know, let's initialize DPA, DPA, DPA.

01:30.230 --> 01:31.400
It will be nothing but.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.710
So they know we don't have any idea.

01:35.730 --> 01:43.230
So what I can do is I can simply say that DP zero d is equal to.

01:44.870 --> 01:45.470
IPRs.

01:47.220 --> 01:47.830
One day.

01:47.850 --> 01:50.920
That means I'm filling all those in the same column.

01:50.990 --> 01:53.100
I I'm filling some max value in this same column.

01:53.660 --> 02:00.840
If it does, it is nothing but intermix because you know, we have to take a minimum of all of them

02:00.840 --> 02:01.230
in the end.

02:01.230 --> 02:01.530
Right.

02:02.130 --> 02:09.030
And now what I can do is that I can simply say, let's run a for a loop again, because this is what

02:09.030 --> 02:09.270
we did.

02:09.270 --> 02:12.000
I read that is there that should not be equal to J.

02:12.920 --> 02:18.780
I can say is I can run another for loop for three and I can call it a-8.

02:18.780 --> 02:20.130
So it's got it dash.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.460
And this will go for all the other three colors again.

02:26.070 --> 02:27.410
And what will happen in this.

02:27.420 --> 02:33.220
I simply say if I is not equal to debt, then only what you do is for the paid.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.850
There is nothing more than minimum of our DP.

02:37.380 --> 02:38.520
I dash.

02:39.860 --> 02:40.640
J minus one.

02:40.640 --> 02:45.950
That is the previous rule and the eight identical grade.

02:46.870 --> 02:48.440
Plus the current cost.

02:48.460 --> 02:49.420
What is the current course?

02:49.450 --> 02:50.920
It is cost 80.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.620
I hope this is very clear.

02:54.160 --> 02:59.260
What I am doing, I not equal to Irish because both of them should not be equal.

03:00.130 --> 03:01.180
Because both of them are.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.950
Because then it's pointless.

03:03.230 --> 03:03.470
They.

03:04.530 --> 03:06.630
So now we can see the vote of the minority.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.730
This is not rigorous, really.

03:09.120 --> 03:13.160
Also, guys, you could have done it in the other format as well.

03:13.170 --> 03:15.420
For example, you can you can say is a deep zero.

03:15.420 --> 03:18.840
There is nothing more than minimum of deep zero.

03:19.470 --> 03:22.290
The minus one goal might be zero.

03:24.280 --> 03:28.180
So the B one and to the minus one.

03:35.060 --> 03:35.270
Right.

03:35.330 --> 03:35.690
So.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.630
And here I is, zero eight.

03:40.020 --> 03:43.530
So although he would have done it in this way for all three.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.120
This is for the zero color.

03:45.450 --> 03:48.250
But all the three colors, you could have just changed it.

03:48.250 --> 03:48.410
Right?

03:48.430 --> 03:49.440
So both of them works.

03:49.650 --> 03:54.960
And in that case, what I'll do is I'll simply remove this or loop as well in our bodies for loops.

03:55.350 --> 03:56.190
I can remove them.

03:56.640 --> 04:00.000
So let me write it below.

04:02.890 --> 04:03.160
Cool.

04:03.310 --> 04:03.730
Here?

04:03.790 --> 04:04.030
Yeah.

04:04.300 --> 04:07.360
So this could have also worked, and the above could have also worked.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.330
So this would have also worked because the complexity is not much.

04:10.630 --> 04:14.650
It will be nothing but three grocery rate and three groceries.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.080
Not not huge.

04:16.090 --> 04:18.850
It is just night outlets coming out.

04:18.850 --> 04:24.280
And in this case, what you could have done is for deep one, you can take zero and you can take two

04:24.550 --> 04:25.660
and cost of one.

04:26.370 --> 04:30.070
And similarly, for two costs of 2G, everyone is correct.

04:30.070 --> 04:38.380
And here you can dig deep zero two minus eight four zero and taking two and one with the zero cost and

04:38.380 --> 04:38.680
so on.

04:39.720 --> 04:42.330
I hope this is very clear to all of you.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.350
Both of them books.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.000
Are you going to recommend this or this?

04:45.510 --> 04:46.530
They will have the same answer.

04:46.830 --> 04:49.560
And finally, what I can do is I can simply sit out.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.380
Minimum of the last three values, which is the.

04:54.820 --> 04:55.330
Zero.

04:56.500 --> 05:06.490
They minus one ISO and minus eight comma DP one and minus one on might be two and minus.

05:08.170 --> 05:08.440
Right.

05:09.040 --> 05:15.400
These are the the last values that means for the last house, whatever painting they can use.

05:15.820 --> 05:19.170
And give me the best ones or.

05:20.170 --> 05:21.820
They can build just a ticket.

05:23.850 --> 05:24.120
Yeah.

05:24.270 --> 05:25.830
And then his answer there.

05:25.830 --> 05:27.840
This is two plus five mystery.

05:28.830 --> 05:30.030
What if I was it?

05:30.300 --> 05:32.400
Accumulated five year and 14 or whatever.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.150
Then I think the answer should be two plus 11 plus three.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.100
211 and three.

05:40.100 --> 05:40.390
Yeah.

05:40.730 --> 05:41.230
216.

05:42.230 --> 05:46.250
So, see, in the next part, guys, and I hope you like this.
