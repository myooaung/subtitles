00:01.050 --> 00:03.220
Everyone, welcome back to the Section.

00:04.170 --> 00:05.970
So here what we have, we have flaws.

00:07.260 --> 00:13.830
The problem statement is that there are no flowers arranged in a row for each eye.

00:13.860 --> 00:18.780
The height and beauty of the white flower from the left is actually any eight eight.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.970
So we have height, edge and beauty.

00:22.010 --> 00:23.630
Of the ideas flow from the left.

00:23.630 --> 00:27.170
So actually the flowers are arranged in a line, basically.

00:28.510 --> 00:28.600
Oh.

00:28.670 --> 00:28.960
Here.

00:29.720 --> 00:30.200
Okay, here.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.560
All the heights are distinct, so it's important to note that all the heights are distinct.

00:34.820 --> 00:37.010
And then I'll give you a follow problem after this.

00:37.010 --> 00:38.360
Where it won't be distinct.

00:38.480 --> 00:43.520
Ain't no DA is pulling out some flowers so that the following condition is met.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.890
So he's actually taking out the flowers.

00:46.220 --> 00:52.190
The height of the remaining flowers, which are not pulled out, are monotonically increasing from left

00:52.190 --> 00:52.580
to right.

00:53.090 --> 00:53.350
Right.

00:53.870 --> 00:54.260
Okay.

00:54.350 --> 00:55.400
The maximum possible.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.140
Some of the result of remaining flowers.

00:57.560 --> 00:57.980
Okay.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.000
So basically.

01:00.360 --> 01:05.560
Thoreau is pulling out some lovers and it's not told how many flowers or which flowers.

01:05.560 --> 01:05.920
Philip.

01:07.190 --> 01:07.710
Pullout.

01:08.150 --> 01:15.620
But these are conditions that whatever he pulls out of the flower, he takes out the remaining flowers

01:15.620 --> 01:16.220
which are there.

01:16.220 --> 01:21.170
They hide should be monitored, organically increase, monotonically increasing means they should be

01:21.170 --> 01:21.980
strictly increasing.

01:21.980 --> 01:26.570
And of course it will always be strictly increasing because all the heights are distinct.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.270
We don't have to do that.

01:28.330 --> 01:30.110
Three trees, nothing like that.

01:31.120 --> 01:34.090
Find the maximum possible some of your remaining followers.

01:34.480 --> 01:38.830
So basically we have to find the maximum possible sum of beauties and not the height.

01:39.790 --> 01:44.020
We have to find the maximum possible sum of beauties of the remaining flowers.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.970
It means the remaining flowers, which are in the monotonically order.

01:48.530 --> 01:49.060
They won't do.

01:49.060 --> 01:50.710
Any artist should have the maximum.

01:52.090 --> 02:01.360
Some of it is a two, for example, this 3142 are the height and then 23 for the other beauties, eight

02:02.050 --> 02:02.440
here.

02:03.010 --> 02:03.280
Okay.

02:03.280 --> 02:11.540
First of all, this problem is kind of related to the longest increasing subsequent problem.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.360
I hope you all have gone through that problem.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.440
It's a very easy problem.

02:14.920 --> 02:20.170
Eight And it's also a very general problem longest in reading, subsequent in the literature that we're

02:20.170 --> 02:22.900
not exactly seen wisely.

02:23.230 --> 02:30.430
What we have to see is we have to find an increasing sequence rate from three one, four, two.

02:30.790 --> 02:32.740
How many increasing sequence can we have?

02:33.040 --> 02:38.560
We're going to have three is increasing sequence one, four, two or we can have three, four is increasing

02:38.560 --> 02:39.040
sequence.

02:39.820 --> 02:41.590
We can have one, four.

02:42.490 --> 02:44.110
We can have one, two.

02:45.550 --> 02:45.870
Eight.

02:46.150 --> 02:47.050
Is there any other?

02:47.350 --> 02:47.830
No.

02:48.700 --> 02:49.000
Eight.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.340
We have these mining reading sequences.

02:52.410 --> 02:53.010
In the.

02:54.290 --> 02:58.100
Above the attrition rate before this above situation.

02:58.100 --> 03:04.080
For this above area, if I take only three as an ingredient sequence, I'll have ten as a beauty.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.900
If I take one, I have to be.

03:05.900 --> 03:08.390
If I take four, I have 30.

03:08.390 --> 03:09.830
And if I do, too, I have 40.

03:10.970 --> 03:19.460
Well, but if I take three fold, then it becomes ten less 38 because I'm digging to lose some of your

03:19.480 --> 03:19.940
raises.

03:20.150 --> 03:20.570
40.

03:21.080 --> 03:26.510
If I take one four, that means it is 20 plus 30, which is give me 50.

03:26.510 --> 03:32.020
And if I take one two, it will give me 20 plus 40, which is 60.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.070
The sum of your days, right?

03:34.370 --> 03:40.070
So what's the maximum among all the beauties that I can have if I only want increasing sequences?

03:40.100 --> 03:41.510
These are including sequences.

03:41.830 --> 03:46.520
If we don't have to worry about the longest in sequence, we have to find an increase in sequence which

03:46.520 --> 03:47.690
gives the maximum beauty.

03:48.350 --> 03:50.000
Well, I hope you are getting this.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.280
How is it kind of related to reading sequences?

03:53.900 --> 03:55.250
What is the maximum we can get.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.870
60 is the maximum.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.880
So 60, isn't it?

03:59.480 --> 04:02.240
Similarly here we can only take one.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.200
Ten will be the answer.

04:03.590 --> 04:07.370
So here the sum of them should be the answer, because all they're all in in increasing order.

04:07.730 --> 04:13.160
And if I have to find the maximum when the number is negative, it means I can take any of these numbers.

04:14.210 --> 04:17.480
I have to take all of these numbers and then I add all of them.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.860
And this is another example on which we can try it.

04:20.870 --> 04:25.970
And I think, well, so this is like an explanation for the problem, guys.

04:26.420 --> 04:28.820
Now let's understand how to solve this problem.

04:28.820 --> 04:36.020
So if if not, I want you to be familiar with that last problem because I am not explaining that part

04:36.020 --> 04:36.290
here.

04:36.890 --> 04:39.410
What is the longest including sequence and how does it work?

04:39.960 --> 04:40.150
Well.

04:40.610 --> 04:44.450
Well, I uses a very standard, dynamic programming problem.

04:45.710 --> 04:50.930
Any reprogramming problem, which gives you an idea about sequences how to apply the new programming

04:50.930 --> 04:52.370
on problems with sequences.

04:52.920 --> 04:57.290
Okay, so now at least what we used to have, we used to have a long list, increasing sequence, and

04:57.290 --> 05:02.540
we had many TV relations alliances already being discussed in the deep section eight.

05:03.250 --> 05:03.640
So.

05:04.880 --> 05:05.210
Yep.

05:06.870 --> 05:07.680
Now.

05:07.740 --> 05:08.090
Okay.

05:08.100 --> 05:13.800
So in L.A. latest, what we had is we had a DVD installation and of course, we'll be discussing kind

05:13.800 --> 05:15.330
of similar to that here.

05:15.600 --> 05:22.350
But if you're new to L.A., I would strongly suggest you look very, very strongly just you do like

05:22.710 --> 05:26.430
go religious first, understand it, deeply understand it, how does it work?

05:26.430 --> 05:34.170
And then come back to this foundation, because it is one step above of L.A. is it will be using kind

05:34.170 --> 05:35.880
of similar dining programming solution.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.670
But here's another step which is height.

05:39.150 --> 05:43.530
And for that, we need to do some calculations made to let me.

05:45.490 --> 05:45.760
Okay.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.400
So let's do this part, right?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.090
Let me copy the N word quickly.

05:49.210 --> 05:50.380
So here we have nine.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.860
2583.

05:56.780 --> 05:57.680
6179.

06:00.030 --> 06:02.640
It's a these these are the agile values.

06:03.510 --> 06:04.070
Is the next one.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.240
It is six it.

06:07.340 --> 06:13.880
8463575.

06:16.300 --> 06:16.870
Well, so.

06:17.730 --> 06:20.740
Earlier we had a temperature, the height values, and this is beauties.

06:21.030 --> 06:23.810
So we're really represented by ice.

06:25.370 --> 06:25.640
Yeah.

06:26.330 --> 06:27.230
Maybe is.

06:28.340 --> 06:28.600
Eight.

06:29.660 --> 06:33.410
So this is the input and the days of Lent nine, of course.

06:33.910 --> 06:37.030
Now, guys, we really try to like.

06:38.720 --> 06:39.980
Makes it over the place.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.350
So here what we'll have is we will have debate.

06:43.220 --> 06:43.790
That means.

06:46.270 --> 06:47.470
The maximum beauty.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.090
Maximum beauty of a sequence.

07:00.510 --> 07:00.960
From.

07:01.740 --> 07:05.250
Let's make some indexes from zero or let's say one.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.920
We're digging one with indexing from 1 to 8.

07:09.340 --> 07:15.480
So here, DPA will represent the third that I'm trying to make and I'll explain it to you.

07:15.490 --> 07:18.610
But if you have understood it, yes, then it becomes very easy for you.

07:19.150 --> 07:24.760
The maximum beauty of a sequence from one do either from the prefix at a delay.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.420
If the sequence, Anthony.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.560
If the sequins aren't.

07:36.970 --> 07:37.390
On.

07:39.120 --> 07:39.410
I.

07:40.340 --> 07:47.150
Well, if this sequence ends and I if it ends on DPA, if it ends on the Iot index rate.

07:47.270 --> 07:51.050
So it is an index, you know, just a pull.

07:51.170 --> 07:54.380
So DBA is a maximum yield of a sequence from a wave, the sequence engine.

07:54.380 --> 07:58.970
And they say, okay, so let's figure out what should be the possible solutions.

07:59.570 --> 07:59.860
Okay.

07:59.860 --> 08:01.580
So let's talk about the first index.

08:01.610 --> 08:02.660
Let me index it.

08:05.870 --> 08:07.550
Right now, I'm just going over the solution.

08:07.550 --> 08:11.180
I think it's I'm just figuring out how does it work?

08:13.340 --> 08:16.410
So for the first ten days ago, March is the maximum beauty.

08:16.460 --> 08:23.650
If the sequence from 1 to 1 ends on one, it should be six because we can only include one element there,

08:23.690 --> 08:24.250
which is six.

08:24.830 --> 08:25.910
The next one is to wait.

08:26.450 --> 08:29.990
Let's come on in next to the four index to what we have.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.880
We have the height of index.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.230
Two is two eight.

08:33.380 --> 08:41.930
So so tell me again, if a sequence ends on index two with height two, is there any other sequence?

08:42.430 --> 08:49.070
Is there any other ending which it provides two Does it extend any other or any other ending extended

08:49.070 --> 08:53.540
the right word that does this to extend any other ending?

08:54.140 --> 08:56.090
You can only extend any other ending.

08:56.090 --> 09:00.790
That means later there was a sequence which ended on one with height one eight.

09:01.070 --> 09:05.810
Then only two can extend this sequence by adding its own beauty value to that one.

09:06.710 --> 09:06.990
Late.

09:07.310 --> 09:09.110
But right now here we can see that.

09:09.410 --> 09:09.840
Yes.

09:09.890 --> 09:11.000
To the left of two.

09:11.480 --> 09:15.230
There is only one element which is four and four is greater than two.

09:15.530 --> 09:17.390
They took two can not extend forward.

09:17.690 --> 09:21.290
If a sequence ended on four, it cannot be extended to two.

09:21.290 --> 09:23.750
Two cannot be added behind four eight.

09:24.180 --> 09:25.910
So what will be the maximum answer?

09:25.910 --> 09:26.630
It will be eight.

09:27.970 --> 09:29.770
Let's talk about index three here.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.100
Index three has a height of five and.

09:34.210 --> 09:35.320
The beauty value of it.

09:36.760 --> 09:43.080
Well, if index three has a height of five, that means then it cannot extend the view.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.670
The sequence which ended on two.

09:46.960 --> 09:52.180
Yes, it can extend a sequence which ended onto can Kennedy extend the sequence which ended on four,

09:52.630 --> 09:53.800
which is on the first index?

09:54.010 --> 10:00.280
Yes, it can also extend that right by beginning because we want monotonically increasing rate.

10:00.280 --> 10:05.410
So two five can be a valid sequence of two heights and four or five can also be a valid sequence of

10:05.740 --> 10:07.010
two, eight, eight.

10:07.990 --> 10:12.070
So again, it extend to in Canada extend for.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.030
Yes, it can extend both.

10:14.860 --> 10:17.470
Now, is this guy five year?

10:17.590 --> 10:18.430
The third index?

10:18.730 --> 10:19.690
It has two options.

10:20.410 --> 10:22.420
And we want the maximum beauty.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.100
So which one should it extend?

10:24.130 --> 10:27.220
Should it extend to and then five?

10:27.250 --> 10:30.190
Or should it extend four and then five?

10:30.760 --> 10:34.300
Of course, it should extend whichever provides him the best ending.

10:34.930 --> 10:39.580
It will only extend the dining, which is the maximum rate which is already providing the maximum,

10:39.910 --> 10:41.500
but two is providing it with it.

10:41.980 --> 10:47.680
The maximum ending which ends on two is eight and which ends on forward is six.

10:48.010 --> 10:49.420
Which one should it extend?

10:49.420 --> 10:52.540
It should extend to five because it.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.600
Is Maxim from six in eight.

10:55.610 --> 10:59.840
So eight plus eight is 6 to 8 plus it is 16.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.160
So we are adding these two values.

11:01.940 --> 11:04.250
Well, because this was a maximum ending.

11:05.690 --> 11:08.280
Eight out of all the available endings.

11:08.300 --> 11:14.990
It has to see that these are the endings in which it can extend what those endings be, whose edge of

11:14.990 --> 11:15.320
jail.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.100
It's quality.

11:17.120 --> 11:17.290
Yeah.

11:17.330 --> 11:18.290
Let me later also.

11:19.740 --> 11:23.270
What we have is days less than I if I'm talking about day.

11:23.480 --> 11:32.020
Then if it's days also less than a day, then only it can extend the value of dpkg.

11:32.060 --> 11:37.880
They the value, the maximum beauty of a sequence which ends on index g.

11:38.630 --> 11:41.780
So the API will be equal to maximum off.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.570
BP is.

11:45.730 --> 11:50.050
Eight and we're days less than I am at today's less than a day.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.130
Also.

11:52.310 --> 11:59.980
Labor's maxim of DVDs, plus its own beauty value, which is I hope there is no problem with this recursive

11:59.990 --> 12:01.760
relation right now.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.650
Similarly, let's move on to the food index.

12:03.650 --> 12:08.870
So here what it has is it has an ending of 8 to 8, can extend five.

12:10.340 --> 12:11.300
It can extend.

12:13.040 --> 12:13.340
Okay.

12:13.340 --> 12:14.240
Let me raise this.

12:17.530 --> 12:18.640
It can extend five.

12:18.970 --> 12:21.730
Yes, it can extend can be extended by two.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.440
It can be extended by four.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.810
Well, what is the best option for it?

12:27.410 --> 12:29.450
If I gives him an ending of 16.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.470
Who gives an ending of it.

12:32.710 --> 12:39.160
And this and the six gives it's the best ending of the food gives it the very best ending of six.

12:39.670 --> 12:41.290
The maximum among them is 16.

12:41.830 --> 12:48.130
Some of you might be wondering that, okay, if it extends by that means if it extends five, that means

12:48.130 --> 12:49.240
five to extend to.

12:49.240 --> 12:49.600
Right.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.850
That means it is kind of extending to.

12:52.150 --> 12:56.290
But as I've already mentioned in the beginning of the series, we don't worry about two transitions.

12:56.770 --> 12:58.870
We only take care of one transition.

12:59.230 --> 13:05.230
That transition take it takes care of the another subsequent transition, right?

13:05.230 --> 13:08.050
So the two transitions are taken into consideration.

13:08.350 --> 13:10.660
Of course, guys will do is back in the end.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.690
You'll understand it very thoroughly.

13:12.700 --> 13:13.480
No problem with that.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.080
Well, so here for it.

13:17.080 --> 13:21.860
What it has is the best ending out of all the available endings too can be a good ending.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.080
Five can be a good ending.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.160
Four can be a good ending.

13:24.910 --> 13:26.920
So the maximum among them is 16.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.660
16 plus four against me.

13:28.960 --> 13:36.400
Wouldn't be the best possible maximum sequence for it is if a sequence ends on it is 20.

13:36.850 --> 13:37.930
I hope you got this point.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.280
Now let's move on to the next part, which is three what?

13:42.280 --> 13:42.790
Three only?

13:42.790 --> 13:45.060
We have one element which is smaller than three bridges.

13:45.310 --> 13:45.590
Two.

13:45.880 --> 13:48.670
The only two can provide a valid ending to three.

13:48.670 --> 13:50.020
So three can only extend two.

13:50.380 --> 13:51.340
It has no option.

13:51.340 --> 13:55.060
It can take it plus six, which will give him 14.

13:55.980 --> 13:56.880
This was about three.

13:56.970 --> 13:57.450
Why not?

13:57.450 --> 13:57.690
Why?

13:57.690 --> 13:58.080
Why not?

13:58.200 --> 13:58.830
Why not forward?

13:58.830 --> 14:01.350
Because all of them are greater than 38.

14:01.650 --> 14:03.900
And of course, guys will trace back each and every.

14:04.870 --> 14:05.350
Index.

14:05.800 --> 14:09.970
Well, now for six guys or six for what can be a good ending.

14:10.950 --> 14:11.980
You can be a good ending.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.750
Five can be a good ending and three can be a good ending and not it is greater than six.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.630
Which of them is giving six the best ending?

14:18.660 --> 14:20.390
It is 16 on five, eight.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.070
So six, 16.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.450
Plus trees 19.

14:25.660 --> 14:26.600
Four six.

14:26.620 --> 14:35.170
The best ending is that the maximum is 19 because it is extending the sequence which ended on five.

14:35.890 --> 14:38.530
That is it index 3147.

14:38.530 --> 14:42.760
Again, we have one before when no one can give you the best ending.

14:42.910 --> 14:43.840
On the left of it.

14:44.140 --> 14:44.390
Why?

14:44.410 --> 14:46.840
Because all of them are greater than one five.

14:46.840 --> 14:47.950
Only or seven.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.690
We can have six as the word ending.

14:50.170 --> 14:51.370
We can also be a good ending.

14:51.370 --> 14:52.450
Five can be a good ending.

14:52.450 --> 14:53.560
One can be a good ending.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.200
Two can be ending in four can be only.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.520
Eight cannot be a good ending.

14:57.520 --> 15:01.660
So what is the maximum it is 1997 is drawn b six.

15:02.350 --> 15:05.670
Well, I hope yours is lead checking that.

15:05.710 --> 15:07.240
How is this answer being formed?

15:08.560 --> 15:10.810
This is 26 and now finally we have nine.

15:10.840 --> 15:15.910
So for nine again, we go back and check what are what are the elements, what are the heights which

15:15.910 --> 15:19.150
are less than nine, although it is a nine on the left of it.

15:19.180 --> 15:24.100
So what's the best ending we get from 26 and 26 plus five is 31.

15:25.070 --> 15:25.310
Was.

15:26.890 --> 15:27.310
Okay.

15:27.340 --> 15:28.470
What should be the final answer?

15:28.480 --> 15:29.260
Should it be?

15:29.380 --> 15:32.140
Should the sequence end on the last element?

15:32.500 --> 15:33.340
Nor should it.

15:33.340 --> 15:34.640
And on the second last element?

15:34.660 --> 15:36.400
No, it cannot anywhere.

15:36.400 --> 15:36.700
Right.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.190
What is the final answer for the whole area?

15:39.700 --> 15:40.780
What is the maximum?

15:41.800 --> 15:44.530
Beauty of the sequence which ended on any of these places.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.240
It can end on any of the places.

15:46.390 --> 15:48.280
It's not necessarily it will end on night.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.730
Of course, we are getting the pollution right now for nine.

15:51.730 --> 15:53.350
The best possible answer for nine.

15:53.350 --> 15:54.750
But it's not necessary.

15:54.820 --> 15:55.300
It can.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.130
It anywhere will.

15:58.070 --> 15:58.490
So.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.440
This is what we the complexity of this.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.780
Let's discuss about this in the next part.

16:04.080 --> 16:10.020
When we call this out will be using advanced resources which had already been introduced introduced

16:10.020 --> 16:12.450
to you in the course in the segment dissection.

16:13.260 --> 16:15.350
You can check it out first.

16:15.750 --> 16:18.030
And in this release, you realize it.

16:18.030 --> 16:19.260
How can use this?

16:19.260 --> 16:24.720
How if you segmented how it becomes so easy for us to put this problem in because.

16:25.740 --> 16:26.730
Okay, I'll explain that.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.110
Don't worry about it.

16:28.940 --> 16:30.440
I hope this trip is fine with you.

16:30.770 --> 16:36.650
And again, just go back and check out Delta Airlines problem if you haven't already at age 31, we

16:36.650 --> 16:37.250
are getting you.

16:37.490 --> 16:37.780
Yeah.

16:37.790 --> 16:38.570
So it's 31.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.760
Well, it stays back, as I said, will trace back to the.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.120
Where did this nine come from?

16:44.150 --> 16:45.650
This nine came from the seven.

16:47.310 --> 16:53.970
This seven came from in a787 as WD value, but only six minus seven is 19.

16:53.970 --> 16:55.160
So which is giving it the 19?

16:55.170 --> 16:55.680
This one.

16:55.980 --> 16:57.630
It came from this.

16:58.140 --> 16:59.310
Now this six.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.040
It has 1990 only 16.

17:01.050 --> 17:04.050
So this comes from this particular location, which is three.

17:04.590 --> 17:05.550
And this three.

17:05.580 --> 17:06.860
It comes from two.

17:08.360 --> 17:13.200
But this is the sequence which has eight plus 1633.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.840
Eight plus eight plus three plus seven plus five.

17:18.140 --> 17:22.340
And the heights are two, three, six, eight, nine, nine.

17:24.380 --> 17:32.150
Always how with 2368293, six, eight and nine flavors from the left and the maximum values 21.

17:33.170 --> 17:35.120
So now where did we get this five days?

17:35.570 --> 17:36.860
Where did we get this five?

17:36.860 --> 17:38.690
So it started from its own location.

17:38.690 --> 17:41.750
Let me market as with some of the color.

17:42.760 --> 17:49.630
And this particular 14 this but this 14 starts from this eight eight.

17:51.020 --> 17:57.680
But this is also coming from this particular bit, which is to aid similarly destroying the destroying

17:57.680 --> 17:59.420
days coming from 16.

18:00.260 --> 18:03.360
And this is individual, right?

18:03.410 --> 18:04.010
It's not coming.

18:04.130 --> 18:05.570
It's not extending anything.

18:06.140 --> 18:08.240
But here, what we can say is this five extends two.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.310
Then this six extends five.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.830
This one extends six.

18:13.990 --> 18:18.430
27 extends six and then nine extends seven eight.

18:18.460 --> 18:23.970
Don't get confused with indexes and heights because both of them up in rotations from one twin will

18:24.550 --> 18:25.870
and they expert will call it out.

18:26.140 --> 18:26.770
Thank you, Grace.
