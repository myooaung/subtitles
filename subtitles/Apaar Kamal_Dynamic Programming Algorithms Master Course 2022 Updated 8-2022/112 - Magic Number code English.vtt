WEBVTT

00:00.670 --> 00:00.900
Yeah.

00:01.000 --> 00:02.370
Let's call this on.

00:02.410 --> 00:03.340
Let me copy.

00:13.220 --> 00:13.780
I'm.

00:15.430 --> 00:15.760
Okay.

00:15.940 --> 00:16.660
You can also do.

00:23.180 --> 00:23.720
No.

00:24.410 --> 00:25.010
And.

00:27.640 --> 00:28.720
Religion this.

00:31.080 --> 00:34.410
So first of all, the numbers are huge.

00:34.750 --> 00:39.780
But in the year 2000, then what we can do is initially we're getting hammered.

00:39.870 --> 00:41.670
Let me quickly again, Mindy.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.670
Big them as global very.

00:48.060 --> 00:51.940
Well and the next ones are in B eight.

00:51.950 --> 00:57.990
So let's it mutates in a comma B we have to take them as a string because they're very huge.

01:00.670 --> 01:01.050
In.

01:03.760 --> 01:07.450
Now there's one thing that we need to take care of.

01:07.480 --> 01:13.150
Let's say if I write a function called Sol, which gives that number of integers which are less than

01:13.150 --> 01:23.740
some particular I say, then the answer will be all B minus all E less smart because we are subtracting

01:23.740 --> 01:25.390
something and then we'll again take moderate.

01:25.930 --> 01:27.610
We need to handle the smallest thing.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.340
Okay, let me quickly write this as well.

01:30.370 --> 01:35.380
Martin's funny nine plus seven release, I hope that's exactly right.

01:35.380 --> 01:37.870
Now we just add more and take more.

01:37.870 --> 01:42.550
This is simple, but here what we have to do is we have to do minus one, e minus one.

01:42.940 --> 01:44.830
But as you all know, is a string.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.690
What is it?

01:46.750 --> 01:49.750
We have to go near this thing because it cannot be stored in an integer.

01:50.390 --> 01:51.780
And how will we do this?

01:51.790 --> 01:52.840
A minus one thing.

01:54.220 --> 01:59.320
Well, what we can do is we can simply subtract a we can simply subtract one from a.

02:00.190 --> 02:02.290
How we can simply subtract one from it.

02:02.860 --> 02:04.090
It's very, very easy.

02:07.270 --> 02:08.320
We open this school.

02:08.530 --> 02:09.460
It's our string.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.740
And it is 10999.

02:12.790 --> 02:13.270
Nine.

02:14.170 --> 02:14.470
Zero.

02:15.190 --> 02:20.500
If I want to subtract one from this string, what I'll do is I started reading backwards if I could

02:20.500 --> 02:28.480
find any non zero digit rate, if there's any non if the if there is zero digit, let's say I'm moving

02:28.480 --> 02:28.960
backwards.

02:29.290 --> 02:31.200
I'll convert all these zeros tonight.

02:31.210 --> 02:39.670
First of all, I or all the continuous zeros that I get from Bec and whenever I find the first non-zero

02:39.670 --> 02:41.220
digit for everybody.

02:41.260 --> 02:45.790
Lewis I'll simply upregulates 86 I simply subtracted back.

02:46.180 --> 02:51.010
But basically and this what will happen this zero will be converted to nine and this nine will be converted

02:51.010 --> 02:51.250
to.

02:52.170 --> 02:52.470
It.

02:53.690 --> 02:55.100
I hope this is clear.

02:55.250 --> 02:55.540
Right.

02:56.060 --> 02:57.040
And, uh.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.720
Anything else that I might miss here.

03:01.820 --> 03:02.630
No, wait.

03:03.410 --> 03:11.030
So I hope this is very clear that how to subject one relative to if there are no dealing zeros exited

03:11.030 --> 03:12.050
1999.

03:12.260 --> 03:16.190
Then what we can do or let's it is it doesn't matter.

03:16.190 --> 03:17.450
We started moving backwards.

03:18.140 --> 03:21.650
So first thing is we are converting all zeros tonight, but there are no zeros.

03:22.220 --> 03:27.700
So if there are no zeros, we'll stop here and just reduce it by one and make it seven in the later.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.700
Let's just call it it.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.340
Not even one lines of code.

03:31.940 --> 03:35.240
What I'll do is let's take and do today and let's make it equal.

03:35.240 --> 03:39.560
To do it by is minus one, because we have just started hitting backwards.

03:40.580 --> 03:46.820
What I'll do is while I is greater than equal to zero and E is equal to.

03:46.820 --> 03:47.360
Equal to.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.980
Zero eight.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.440
But what we're doing is we are moving backwards.

03:52.530 --> 03:54.370
And if it is, it goes to zero.

03:54.420 --> 03:56.880
Just make equals to nine.

03:58.410 --> 04:00.930
I hope this is clear data for all zeros.

04:00.940 --> 04:05.730
It will become night and I lower a minus, meaning it is moving backwards.

04:06.150 --> 04:12.900
Wherever this loop breaks it means I found a non zero number eight we were found a non and above.

04:12.900 --> 04:19.230
What I do is I'll simply say that okay now for this i.e. make it equal to A-minus.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.970
It's a character characteristic I will use.

04:22.970 --> 04:27.590
It will subtract by one and automatically give me the correct character that I need.

04:28.580 --> 04:29.760
It has nothing to do with me.

04:29.790 --> 04:32.910
Every day they deal with heaven because this is a sky correctness.

04:32.910 --> 04:33.390
Objection.

04:34.140 --> 04:34.920
I hope it is clear.

04:35.890 --> 04:36.170
They?

04:38.060 --> 04:42.320
So let's bring day one so that it becomes clear to everyone.

04:45.060 --> 04:45.720
And after.

04:49.280 --> 04:49.690
Okay.

04:49.700 --> 04:50.570
So.

04:51.720 --> 04:52.530
It's just been.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.750
But what I'm doing is great.

04:56.860 --> 04:57.130
Okay.

04:57.220 --> 05:02.980
So why is greater than equal to zero and equals two equals to zero.

05:03.920 --> 05:04.220
Eight.

05:05.130 --> 05:10.400
What I'm doing is I'm asking a question name who is then for me.

05:11.270 --> 05:16.340
This large zero becomes nine and this one becomes 002, zero becomes nine.

05:17.030 --> 05:20.960
The loop breaks and then this first one becomes zero.

05:21.800 --> 05:21.970
Well.

05:22.160 --> 05:25.760
So it becomes nine instead of ten subjected when basically.

05:26.550 --> 05:27.450
I hope this is clear.

05:27.750 --> 05:29.520
No literary dysfunction called solve.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.060
No, no.

05:30.060 --> 05:32.160
We can easily see it instead of minus one.

05:32.160 --> 05:35.760
We can see all B minus all of it because not eight equals three minus.

05:36.730 --> 05:42.760
Well, I also got one more problem, because there's something special about that problem.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.140
And it is called A Lady's From.

05:46.060 --> 05:47.260
You can also see it in the.

05:48.730 --> 05:49.570
Assignment section.

05:50.740 --> 05:51.850
And then you.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.580
You all can solve all the other problems yourself.

05:54.790 --> 05:56.470
After that, you won't be needing much help.

05:59.460 --> 06:07.950
So this it's resolved quickly and we know we need a strong and we always knew testing and.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.300
In all.

06:13.180 --> 06:21.310
So in this we have a string, let's call it underscore two I and will become underscoring very simple.

06:21.820 --> 06:24.190
And it will return whatever it be.

06:24.190 --> 06:26.790
It has it be index.

06:26.800 --> 06:27.820
So index is zero.

06:27.850 --> 06:28.600
Last is.

06:29.530 --> 06:30.840
I true initially.

06:30.850 --> 06:36.100
And the third thing that we were going to pass was that we discussed rate the smart listing.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.530
So initially it will be zero.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.940
Let's write this function also.

06:44.380 --> 06:50.140
Because now we are trying to make the numbers into eggs.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.040
Pool.

06:52.550 --> 06:53.470
Two, three.

06:54.510 --> 06:55.230
One last.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.440
And finally it will be.

06:58.610 --> 07:00.210
I've already taken more to here.

07:00.230 --> 07:00.680
So let me.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.140
Let me take some part.

07:04.200 --> 07:04.960
Are legitimate.

07:05.270 --> 07:05.840
Legitimate?

07:06.360 --> 07:09.480
Well, because I'm adding deserts and digging mud continuously.

07:10.400 --> 07:10.660
Right.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.830
So let's find out, Bill.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.660
And we know how to find this out.

07:14.780 --> 07:20.330
If lost, then it becomes an offer index minus.

07:22.090 --> 07:22.450
Zero.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.090
Otherwise it is right.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.050
We know this very simple.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.450
Next we want answer.

07:28.630 --> 07:28.930
Let.

07:28.930 --> 07:30.760
The answer is initially equal to zero.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.500
And now we have two cases, the first cases.

07:36.010 --> 07:40.980
If we are on the one position and the second is if we are on the on position eight.

07:41.320 --> 07:44.950
If we are on the event, bush in this index should be equal to it because.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.240
It's a zero based index, a distinct zero based index.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.420
So absolute zero represents the first index, platinum.

07:53.450 --> 07:58.880
So of course you won't get confused, but you have reached, you know, you understood the zero base

07:58.880 --> 08:03.560
indexing a very simple if index is.

08:07.450 --> 08:12.070
And that means we are on even position of the number.

08:12.580 --> 08:13.600
Otherwise we are on the.

08:14.830 --> 08:16.210
Odd position.

08:16.780 --> 08:17.080
Well.

08:18.720 --> 08:23.610
So if index is already are on the even position and what we what we have to do we just have to.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.450
Have be in my digits eight.

08:27.890 --> 08:29.570
So what else am I doing?

08:29.580 --> 08:33.790
Assembly's answer plus equals to DP because I'm having only D as my digit.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.130
So last two.

08:36.130 --> 08:38.020
We all know last.

08:39.450 --> 08:40.230
Let's to.

08:40.830 --> 08:41.760
It'll come.

08:42.180 --> 08:43.320
And this will be.

08:45.290 --> 08:54.650
Digital mode made the digital mode play digital mart into ten plus eight and Wal Mart by eight because

08:54.650 --> 08:55.670
we are giving discount.

08:59.410 --> 09:03.410
One thing that we'll lose out here is the thing about it.

09:03.430 --> 09:08.350
What are we losing by not using this value that we have calculated?

09:08.960 --> 09:10.120
Just think about this.

09:10.120 --> 09:10.900
That if.

09:12.620 --> 09:12.890
Yeah.

09:12.920 --> 09:20.180
Just think about this, that if I'm placing a digital D, but it is already greater than in 8000.

09:20.210 --> 09:22.040
Let me quickly give you an example.

09:22.910 --> 09:30.500
It's a digital DS seven and the number is one, two, three, four, five, eight.

09:30.630 --> 09:37.010
So the operation, so it's fine, I'm keeping one or the even positions now I can only keep one or 210.

09:37.220 --> 09:39.500
I can only keep these three values right.

09:39.680 --> 09:46.040
But as the problem suggests that you cannot keep 102, you can only keep seven because these equals

09:46.040 --> 09:47.150
278.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.890
Which seven is greater than two.

09:49.220 --> 09:50.300
Will I be able to keep it?

09:51.060 --> 09:51.380
No.

09:51.980 --> 09:57.990
But let's see if instead of two the number was 18345, then I was, then I will be able to keep seven.

09:57.990 --> 10:01.550
And the second play I will getting my point eight.

10:02.120 --> 10:02.890
This is important.

10:02.900 --> 10:05.720
And what digit is over here, right?

10:06.050 --> 10:07.910
So in this case, this will be equal to it.

10:08.690 --> 10:15.800
So if these less than equal to it, if B is less than or equal to L, it tells the number well we are

10:15.800 --> 10:17.480
going to place, but we're not placing all the numbers.

10:17.480 --> 10:24.560
We are placing only one digit because, you know, okay, so what we can do is we can simply say if

10:25.310 --> 10:29.090
he is less than equals to ten, then only we will place.

10:31.940 --> 10:32.200
Well.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.110
So this is when we place DH.

10:34.280 --> 10:40.930
And this is also very okay with this lost and equals reconstructed.

10:41.540 --> 10:44.930
So if Daisy goes through that, that means again, we are on the last branch.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.110
If it is not, then we are not on the last front.

10:47.610 --> 10:47.780
I have.

10:47.780 --> 10:48.320
This is clear.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.100
Now let's do this for the art positions as well.

10:52.320 --> 10:56.880
So for our positions too, we can keep all the digits except be late.

10:57.370 --> 10:58.160
Four digits.

10:59.300 --> 11:00.470
We'll start from zero.

11:00.680 --> 11:05.090
It will go to Bill and then Bill if dessert.

11:06.090 --> 11:07.430
Is equal to D.

11:07.440 --> 11:11.670
Then I will simply continue because I don't want to keep it otherwise.

11:12.240 --> 11:16.290
Simple index putting here would index plus when it.

11:17.350 --> 11:18.400
Index plus one.

11:19.690 --> 11:22.120
And last.

11:22.570 --> 11:28.900
And if the digit is equal to if in the digital realm placing.

11:29.530 --> 11:30.610
And finally.

11:32.130 --> 11:38.700
Okay so I hope you don't get confused by I'm placing of I'm doing a continue over there because at all

11:38.700 --> 11:39.510
positions.

11:41.090 --> 11:41.480
Cannot.

11:42.190 --> 11:44.140
Please be late.

11:44.750 --> 11:49.160
And finally, what happened is the last thing is a digit more ready to let me pocket this?

11:50.290 --> 11:52.930
Instead and instead of deed, we have digits.

11:54.930 --> 11:56.550
But this is the arbitration case.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.360
And finally, what I'll do is I'll let Andy answer.

12:02.090 --> 12:03.730
Now only one thing remains.

12:03.740 --> 12:04.710
That is a base case.

12:04.760 --> 12:05.780
What is a base case here?

12:05.810 --> 12:07.010
What basic do we need?

12:07.610 --> 12:08.810
This case is very simple.

12:09.150 --> 12:09.530
If.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.340
It's a I'm going through the tree.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.240
I've reached the end.

12:14.140 --> 12:16.270
So if I to the Internet, what index I'm on.

12:18.310 --> 12:21.070
Two indexes equals two and the size.

12:22.380 --> 12:27.000
That means I want a base case like anything is nothing to do of life.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.560
And the last thing is legitimate.

12:30.270 --> 12:31.260
What is a valid number?

12:31.890 --> 12:33.270
The value number is a number.

12:33.630 --> 12:40.130
If it is a multiple of em, that means if it is divisible by am, I am what I can simply say.

12:40.140 --> 12:45.750
I can simply say it is an individual by I am if digit mod is equal to zero because we are already taking

12:45.750 --> 12:47.220
this digit mod and.

12:48.480 --> 12:48.920
Will they?

12:49.590 --> 12:53.940
So this will give me true or false, depending on whether it is a number, a good number or not.

12:54.210 --> 12:59.310
And the second thing, the magic thing that we are handling, it's it's in the implementation, not

12:59.850 --> 13:04.420
in the base case where our position we are not keeping be at an even position.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.900
We are keeping the wherever it is possible.

13:08.270 --> 13:11.090
Well, let me build this might be some errors.

13:12.360 --> 13:12.520
No.

13:12.780 --> 13:13.860
So we have got it.

13:13.950 --> 13:15.390
Let me check the.

13:18.410 --> 13:18.980
The.

13:20.550 --> 13:21.020
Bugs.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.330
Or works.

13:25.910 --> 13:27.460
And this is the last one.

13:27.860 --> 13:30.770
This six books, all this reworking, of course.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.910
I'll check I with the code, but I hope you understood the problem.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.040
It was a 2200 added problem.

13:37.190 --> 13:40.010
It's just because the digital divide is not that common.

13:40.370 --> 13:43.100
But as you have seen that it is very easy to cut.

13:43.310 --> 13:45.770
Of course, there are some economic issues that we need to handle.

13:46.070 --> 13:47.960
We need to keep these things in mind as well.

13:49.580 --> 13:50.120
And.

13:51.280 --> 13:55.150
But I understood that the GDP is not that tough like this.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.850
You just need to do some work over here.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.250
Need to define the state.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.800
And move through the city.

14:03.340 --> 14:08.020
Always remember whatever strategy of defining whatever variables you have begun here.

14:08.620 --> 14:09.240
Let's see.

14:09.250 --> 14:09.580
Okay.

14:09.790 --> 14:11.530
One thing that is leftist memorization.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.230
I will do that.

14:14.590 --> 14:15.230
Don't worry.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.460
Of course you can also try doing memorisation yourself.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.140
Now, just just remember this.

14:22.140 --> 14:28.350
If all the states are increasing, some memory limit actually means if these states are huge, then

14:28.350 --> 14:33.690
always remember that there will be some trick involved which will reduce districts and you just have

14:33.690 --> 14:36.390
to find out the trick like we did in the previous problem.

14:37.530 --> 14:41.700
Let's let's do memorization quickly and more index.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.150
So what is the length of the index?

14:43.170 --> 14:47.340
We can see that index goes to later size, which is 2008.

14:48.060 --> 14:49.890
It's 2000.

14:51.510 --> 14:54.390
What is the second last to just do and what is digit more?

14:54.480 --> 14:55.290
So digit more.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.190
We are always taking it more by.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.150
It will always be less than him.

14:59.430 --> 15:00.660
And what is the land of him?

15:01.050 --> 15:01.860
It is 2000.

15:04.180 --> 15:05.710
So I think this is a doable.

15:06.880 --> 15:07.730
Verse eight.

15:08.260 --> 15:10.240
So let me set it.

15:11.580 --> 15:12.300
Ma'am said.

15:13.130 --> 15:14.240
And moon minus.

15:15.980 --> 15:16.380
Of.

15:19.950 --> 15:21.750
Let's stay with here.

15:31.510 --> 15:34.780
Memo fix last.

15:35.570 --> 15:36.910
It should not.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.670
This is not equal to minus when you're done.

15:44.860 --> 15:45.400
Okay.

15:45.790 --> 15:48.220
And finally, we need to just memorize it.

15:49.570 --> 15:50.250
Have this, folks.

15:53.580 --> 15:53.910
So.

15:53.910 --> 15:54.690
Thank you, everyone.

15:54.750 --> 15:55.380
So in the next.
