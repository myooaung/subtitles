00:00.650 --> 00:01.520
Welcome back, guys.

00:01.640 --> 00:04.220
So here I have a very cool problem for you.

00:04.220 --> 00:06.700
And first of all, I want you to go through this.

00:07.520 --> 00:08.240
And there are.

00:09.240 --> 00:12.600
And types of people in the world, those who understand binary and those who don't.

00:13.350 --> 00:15.960
So is this ten or.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.690
You can convert this to binary, right?

00:21.200 --> 00:22.220
Now let's move on to the.

00:24.600 --> 00:25.150
Problem.

00:25.200 --> 00:31.290
So the problem is very nice and it will give you a deeper dive into what is actually.

00:32.470 --> 00:33.180
Finally.

00:33.610 --> 00:34.630
Excellent intuition.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.460
It's a divide and conquer approach.

00:36.460 --> 00:36.770
Right.

00:36.790 --> 00:39.850
But we are actually using manipulation to code.

00:41.630 --> 00:43.310
Despite eight to.

00:44.660 --> 00:45.950
The problem is very simple.

00:46.580 --> 00:51.710
You are coding this in C++, so do not think of any other language because it will become very easy.

00:54.420 --> 00:56.550
What you have is you have been given tremendous.

00:58.050 --> 01:04.110
Fabianski The fun fact is that all these three are less than equals returning to the power.

01:04.780 --> 01:11.790
15 eight And what you want to do is you want to find out e in to be.

01:13.110 --> 01:14.370
My feet.

01:16.580 --> 01:19.670
So you want to find out this in the report, see how they do it.

01:20.960 --> 01:25.070
So just imagine yourself sitting in an interview and solving this problem.

01:25.070 --> 01:26.180
This was a video.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.950
And try to do this.

01:29.330 --> 01:31.310
So, of course, guys, brute force won't work.

01:31.670 --> 01:34.750
So you can just see out into.

01:34.770 --> 01:36.020
We might see.

01:37.190 --> 01:38.060
Vote by.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.710
By brute force won't work.

01:44.650 --> 01:45.340
Because.

01:48.700 --> 01:53.830
Employees because is often with about 15, we also often do the above 15 range.

01:54.430 --> 02:00.150
If you multiply them even in like even in like inside, or if you're just multiplying them, this,

02:00.370 --> 02:02.770
this is actually exceeding my long, long interchange.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.620
Even on same long, long trains is also being exceeded.

02:05.950 --> 02:12.490
If you multiplied these two values because the range of the new number will go around ten to the poverty

02:12.490 --> 02:17.380
rate which cannot be stored in any format, it can be stored in string eight.

02:17.380 --> 02:20.440
But that will become again a heavier task auditing.

02:21.040 --> 02:25.120
Put it as strings and you have to do that pen and paper job again.

02:26.110 --> 02:28.690
So I'm not asking for a string solution, but a good one.

02:29.930 --> 02:31.790
So how do you do it, guys?

02:34.400 --> 02:41.060
So this one work, we ought to be very clear with this because this is going above the limit of my long,

02:41.060 --> 02:44.210
long unit and it will give me a garbage value to garbage valued.

02:44.210 --> 02:46.970
Marty will be another garbage or you will.

02:47.450 --> 02:49.100
So this is not working the sickness.

02:49.370 --> 02:53.120
Some of you might be thinking the second approach and that is e.

02:53.180 --> 02:54.260
More c.

02:55.240 --> 02:55.800
Into.

02:55.810 --> 02:58.420
We might see, Marty.

02:59.320 --> 03:02.710
That's how we distribute my insight when we're trying to find is.

03:03.130 --> 03:05.020
Again, I used the same reason.

03:05.030 --> 03:05.740
So let's see.

03:06.280 --> 03:06.790
Let's see.

03:07.030 --> 03:07.970
That is equals.

03:07.990 --> 03:12.880
To be is equal to returning above 15 and sees equals return to the above 15 minus one.

03:13.450 --> 03:15.160
It is nine, 14 times eight.

03:16.270 --> 03:16.690
Whatever.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.890
So if you take MOOC.

03:20.790 --> 03:21.090
Okay.

03:21.090 --> 03:23.610
So I think I have just reversed the situation.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.570
So let's say as he was too busy, goes to return to the power.

03:31.350 --> 03:32.700
15 minus one.

03:33.960 --> 03:34.340
Right.

03:34.350 --> 03:36.090
And season ended about 15.

03:36.420 --> 03:41.600
If you take out, then it will be only because C is greater than the immunity guys.

03:41.610 --> 03:42.600
B more c will be.

03:42.630 --> 03:44.970
B only because it is greater than.

03:46.470 --> 03:52.830
Because she's eager to then be ready to what this problem statement converting to what does it actually

03:52.830 --> 03:53.130
become?

03:53.130 --> 03:55.810
It becomes a normal statement that is aimed to be multi.

03:56.890 --> 03:59.950
We're NBA legend and the finances are present and above.

04:00.460 --> 04:04.480
What I mean to say is this march is unnecessary here in this case.

04:05.880 --> 04:09.540
Again for the end, we are offering 15, ten, 12, 15.

04:09.870 --> 04:11.280
Both of them are out of this range.

04:12.150 --> 04:14.220
They can't cannot be multiplied by brute force.

04:15.030 --> 04:16.080
I just want you to.

04:18.460 --> 04:21.010
If if you're not like if you weren't here.

04:21.010 --> 04:27.610
And so this is normal that you are watching this video on the topic of.

04:28.730 --> 04:30.050
Binary multiplication.

04:30.050 --> 04:32.390
So instead of exponential, we have multiplication.

04:32.990 --> 04:35.000
Is this nothing different?

04:35.630 --> 04:35.930
So.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.440
It got a few relatable.

04:39.470 --> 04:42.440
It's like relatable from this to this, you can easily relate.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.500
It is in binary exponential and what happens?

04:49.810 --> 04:53.830
Anyway, let's write a binary multiplication.

04:58.710 --> 04:59.970
Binary x1 intuition.

04:59.970 --> 05:00.690
What does it do?

05:00.690 --> 05:07.560
Is it calculate eight of the power to be and this will get a grid in to be more than will be taken later.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.560
Do not worry about eight.

05:10.270 --> 05:12.320
The counting is in by an exponential action.

05:12.330 --> 05:14.640
It is actually a multiplied by times.

05:16.610 --> 05:18.680
We don't meet environment obligation.

05:18.680 --> 05:24.380
It is A-plus e plus e plus e ratings in both.

05:24.410 --> 05:26.300
What we'll do is we'll simply divide.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.230
Or break.

05:29.260 --> 05:30.340
Being too binary.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.290
Eight and.

05:35.370 --> 05:41.760
The rest of the part will remain seemingly so here in like binary exponential I would actually multiplying

05:41.780 --> 05:46.890
error resulting, but in binding multiplication I will simply add a to the resultant.

05:47.430 --> 05:47.880
Here I am.

05:47.910 --> 05:49.590
So you're saying is it goes to a square.

05:49.830 --> 05:54.390
But in binary multiplication I'll see is equal to 28.

05:54.790 --> 05:55.770
What does that mean?

05:55.770 --> 05:58.500
That if I want to find out e in do.

06:00.010 --> 06:01.930
That is an excellent example to entertain.

06:02.770 --> 06:03.850
So how can this be done?

06:03.850 --> 06:04.570
This can be done.

06:04.590 --> 06:06.190
Is doing do for.

06:07.310 --> 06:09.270
But went 28 plus two into two.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.020
Eight because I've divided ten into bands.

06:13.620 --> 06:14.280
Not a big deal.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.530
Guys divide the next term into binary.

06:16.950 --> 06:22.380
And finally, do they do these multiplications and continuously take mod eight.

06:22.890 --> 06:25.500
So a very easy, a very easy task guys.

06:25.830 --> 06:26.730
So let's call it out.

06:26.730 --> 06:30.030
I don't think much explanation is to do a.

06:31.570 --> 06:31.870
Yeah.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.160
If I want to.

06:35.170 --> 06:37.510
Yeah, this is it.

06:37.510 --> 06:37.660
Me.

06:37.660 --> 06:38.170
Save it.

06:38.380 --> 06:38.980
I saved it.

06:39.100 --> 06:39.880
Yeah, I've saved it.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.460
So let's multiply.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.330
My deep lie.

06:46.890 --> 06:48.630
Let's multiply it into be.

06:49.610 --> 06:53.660
With some with some sort of C instead of this mark and.

06:55.470 --> 06:55.950
At stake.

06:55.950 --> 06:58.350
This is a return as he goes to one guy.

06:58.350 --> 06:59.190
It's not a big deal.

06:59.640 --> 07:04.650
So again, until I have B, then what I need to do is simple.

07:04.860 --> 07:05.370
If.

07:06.710 --> 07:07.100
I don't.

07:07.100 --> 07:08.090
I don't know why I did it.

07:08.110 --> 07:17.470
Is it if B and one then resultant is equal to the the retained plus e not multiply this time is equal

07:17.490 --> 07:18.320
to two into we.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.840
Or instead we can record every ten is a plus equals two.

07:23.240 --> 07:26.390
And this lets you go through to the formalistic.

07:26.390 --> 07:33.650
A very basic example is true to the Republican and let's say the models are very big integer 29 plus

07:33.650 --> 07:33.920
soon.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.930
I choke it, multiply.

07:44.160 --> 07:44.520
Okay.

07:45.070 --> 07:46.650
But these children will not be born.

07:46.650 --> 07:51.780
It will be zero because right now animating things aren't multiplying eight initially zero.

07:52.560 --> 07:52.790
Yeah.

07:52.800 --> 08:00.690
So I've got 20 and it's about 20 right now to march or not work because we're doing it on this party

08:00.690 --> 08:05.370
again, running to 20 will be four and I hope you understood this part.

08:05.790 --> 08:08.580
Now let's do the marvellous part again.

08:08.610 --> 08:11.700
The same thing that they're doing is it go through their own pleasure.

08:12.030 --> 08:15.180
Whenever Ritalin exceeds my limit, let stigma.

08:15.180 --> 08:17.560
And similarly age goes for two in the end.

08:17.590 --> 08:19.830
And it went away exceeded my moral limit.

08:19.860 --> 08:20.760
Let's take it.

08:21.570 --> 08:23.640
Oh, it's sigmoid by the.

08:24.650 --> 08:28.760
Well, why am I doing this vivo exceed my long, long interchange?

08:28.760 --> 08:35.180
Because a very, very good problem is that I'm just adding a resultant rate.

08:35.180 --> 08:45.050
So resultant is becoming resultant plus B of these both resultant and E are less than ten to about 15

08:45.050 --> 08:50.390
because I am continuously taking more if you when they exceed 10 to 15, I'm going to be taking my rate.

08:50.840 --> 08:55.130
If I add both of them, then what will be the range from ten to the above 16?

08:55.610 --> 09:00.800
In the worst case, if I do indeed as often as above 15 range in the wash because they can go to the

09:00.800 --> 09:07.790
end of the word 16 but this standard of 16 is easily storable in my data, in my long longing.

09:10.410 --> 09:15.810
Easily story builds because we are just adding bandages entities and again for the second operation

09:15.810 --> 09:16.920
is very easy.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.700
We're not multiplying anything and so this is doing it.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.560
Of course we are multiplying, but we can also write it as a plus equals two.

09:23.560 --> 09:23.760
We.

09:24.790 --> 09:25.090
Right.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.810
So again, what I'm doing is I'm saying, is it going to be a blessing?

09:29.260 --> 09:34.750
Again, I'm adding two integers of it instead of the 15, so their total range will be less than ten

09:34.750 --> 09:41.590
to the power 16 and then penalty mode will again become less than 10 to 15 Y because t is less than

09:41.620 --> 09:45.700
ten to the power 15 while taking more by C they will again move back.

09:46.330 --> 09:53.140
This is just to give you a brief idea about how does exponential what is what is binary conversion of

09:53.140 --> 09:53.530
a number?

09:54.040 --> 09:55.750
How is this VI loop actually working?

09:55.750 --> 09:59.680
So it's not about multiplication or only about exponential.

10:00.010 --> 10:01.690
This can be used in various places.

10:02.530 --> 10:05.800
In the next topic you will see what is metrics exponential.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.050
So in Dallas we will be using the same thing.

10:08.680 --> 10:11.350
H I just want to give you a very.

10:14.230 --> 10:17.080
Diverse application of binary numbers.

10:17.540 --> 10:25.450
So it's it isn't like a binding numbers are a very big thing and they are kind of give to the humanity

10:25.450 --> 10:29.140
because everything that we see is working in binary.

10:29.860 --> 10:33.070
They may be like hundred, 200 years.

10:33.070 --> 10:36.070
Everything works in quantum's which are not perfect binaries.

10:36.490 --> 10:40.390
But yes, right now this is possible because of binary.

10:40.390 --> 10:40.710
Right.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.020
And yeah, we'll see in the next four days.

10:44.320 --> 10:44.710
Thank you.
