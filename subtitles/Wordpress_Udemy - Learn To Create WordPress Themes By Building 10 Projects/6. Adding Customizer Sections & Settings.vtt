WEBVTT

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.950
This video we're going to create our custom front page along with the showcase and boxes here which

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.960
we'll be able to customize using WP customize or.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.770
All right.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.560
Which is something that we haven't done before so let's go in and create a new file in our theme and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.850
we're going to save it as front page dot peach tree.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.930
All right and if we go and reload it's a blank page automatically because it's working at this file

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.600
for the home page so we can do is copy everything that's in the index page and then paste it in there

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.280
and then we should get the same thing back.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.960
All right.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.130
So we want to edit some stuff here but before we do that we're going to we're going to create our custom

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.000
sections in the customize or so in the Customize.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.270
Here you can see that we have three sections site identity menus and static front page.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.120
And what I'm going to show you how to do is to create your own custom sections.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.790
We're going to have one for the banner and we're going to happen from the boxes.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.570
All right before we do that let's go.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.080
Let's see.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.280
We're going to go back and go into pages and I want to create two new pages one is going to be home

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.580
and that doesn't need any content.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.010
And then another one which will be called Blog which also doesn't need any content.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.070
And then if we go to settings reading We're going to set a static page as the front page.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.980
We're going to choose home and then the post page we're going to choose blog.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.320
OK that way we can have menu items that go to these pages if we go back to the the front end nothing's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.550
changed.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.340
All right so let's go back to the custom Mizer.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.190
OK.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:04.020
And then we're going to go to our two functions P2P file and this is where we're going to do everything

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.380
we're going to add a new section we're going to add a setting and the control.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:19.990
So what we need to do is say function we're going to create a function called business customize.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.190
Underscore register.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.900
Right.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:32.350
And that's going to take in a W.P. under store customized variable.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.240
All right.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.310
And this is where we can put all of our stuff.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.980
Now we're going to need an action to to hook into.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.000
So down here we're going to say add action.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.410
The hook is going to be customize register.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.260
Second parameter is going to be the function that we just created

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.930
.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.680
All right.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.820
OK now we're going to go in here.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.910
And first thing we want to do is create a new section.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.920
Okay so this is going to be the banner section.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.290
So to do that we're going to take that W.P. customized variable.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.130
And then we're going to call a method called ad section

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.930
and that's going to take in section name which will be banner.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.260
And then an array

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.860
and in the Saray we're going to include a title

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:49.260
which will be when you use the the language function here or unsorry localization function and let's

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.990
say banner and then the theme which is going to be business.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.190
Okay we can also have a description

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.190
and we're going to use the ASP print function here

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:19.170
and in here we're going to use our localization function and let's say options

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.810
for home page planner.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.340
Right.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.560
And then another parameter which will be the theme name business.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.870
And next thing we're going to set is the priority

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.180
and we're going to set that to 130.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.420
All right.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:54.490
So that should create the section let's go ahead and save it and it's not showing up yet.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.940
And it's not showing up because we don't have any settings or controls in that section yet.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.770
So let's do that.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.600
We're going to go right under to what we just did and let's do the headings setting.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.210
OK.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.480
So the heading will be the H-1 that displays.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.200
OK.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:32.920
So we're going to take that W.P. customize object and we're going to call add setting.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.670
OK.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.830
And then that's going to take in the setting which will be banner heading.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.070
And then second parameter will be an array.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.780
And we're going to say default OK the default.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:03.120
We're going to use this underscore X and then the default text which will just say Vanner heading

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.780
right.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:16.780
And the next thing we need here the next option is going to be the type and the type can either be option

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.960
or theme maade.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.930
In most cases you're going to choose theme.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.840
All right.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.840
And that's it for the setting now.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.250
This takes care of the setting but we still have no control for it inside the customizes So we need

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.790
to create that as well.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.120
So this will be the heading control

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.690
and I'm just going to copy this actually.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:51.340
Except we want to change this to add control and we want this banner are heading and then down here

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.980
we're going to change this to label and for the label

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.310
say heading.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.900
OK.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:13.750
We also need to specify the section that we want this to be in and the section we wanted to be in is

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.980
the banner section

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.010
.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.590
Okay.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.600
And then we also want to set priority.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.450
This is going to be 20.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.110
All right so it's good and save it and go back and reload.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.370
And now you can see we have a new section called banner.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:46.740
If I click on that you can see we have heading and it's even filled with the default of banner heading

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.640
.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.200
So I'm going to create the rest of these before we go in and they actually show you how to use them

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:53.900
.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.950
So we'll do is let's copy the headings setting and control.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:06.910
And then this next aspect that we want is the text of the banner.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.300
So this will be text setting and text control.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.270
Let's change this to be in a text.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:28.310
Now for the default I'm just going to paste in some content here.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.530
OK.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.610
Type is going to be theme maade that's fine.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:42.940
Change this to ban or text change this to text and that should be good.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.780
So if we save that we go back and reload banner.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.040
Now we have the text option as well.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.580
Next we want the button text in the button you are l.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:09:00.850
Someone to copy what we have right here setting and control.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:06.030
This is going to be for the button.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:15.550
We'll change it to Banner between text and for the default we'll just say sign up

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.350
button text.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.640
Ok let's also do the button you are l

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:42.450
.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:56.020
I'm just going to have this be HGT P test dot com

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.220
All right check it out.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:12.120
All right.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.070
Good.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.440
The last field there we're going to need is the air actually.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:20.410
What is this missing argument to for X online 52.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.480
What is this.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.780
Oh this should have business as well.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.550
OK.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.850
OK so next we need the image.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.850
And this is going to work just a little differently.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:48.600
So I'm going to just copy the selling and control and this is going to be for

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.250
background image selling

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.730
.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.770
Let's change this to banner image.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:17.420
Now for for the default we're going to have to change this to just get rid of this whole thing.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:27.510
And actually we wanted to get blog info because we need to get the exact directory where the images

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.930
will be uploaded and also fetched from.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.740
So we're going to go to template directory

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:49.080
and then we're going to just concatenate on slash m g slash banner dot Jay peg.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.070
OK that's going to be the default image.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.470
Now we'll go down here.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.920
And for our control this is going to work a little differently.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.720
Actually you know I'm going to do is just get rid of everything that's that's in the control

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:13.060
.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:14.780
All right.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.010
Well we're going to do here is we're going to say new W.P. underscore

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:34.630
customized underscore image underscore control and then we're going to pass in W.P. underscore customize

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.150
.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:49.350
And then let's say banner and instead it's be in quotes Bynner underscore image.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:57.010
And then the next parameter will be in the array.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:58.360
Right.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.480
And then in this array will do the label

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.140
background image

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:16.550
.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.180
You need to assign it to a section which will be obviously banner

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:32.360
and then we're also going to add settings and this will just be banner image.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:33.980
All right.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.430
So let's go ahead and save that.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.800
Now we should have that banner Jay Pegge already there

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.930
.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.410
OK which we do.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.300
So let's go back here and reload.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:57.690
And now we have this background image selection you can see that even displays what we have as a default

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.750
.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:05.550
Now what I want to do before we actually implement any of these I want to do the boxes.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.120
OK.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.400
So it's going to be very similar.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.640
We're just going to create a new section.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:15.220
I'm actually going to do a lot of pasting and just to save time.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.710
So let's go

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:24.220
right to the low here and paste this in.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.950
OK we're just adding a new section called boxes just like we did with the banner

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:39.960
and then we're just going to need a bunch of settings and controls.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.070
So let's do the box one.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.960
So pasted in going to go over it.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:54.840
OK so box 1 heading setting that will be this right here.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:03.590
And for a default we're just going to say Box 1 heading and why these are so far over.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.000
All right.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:12.600
And then the type is the mod and then we have the control for Box 1 heading right here we have the text

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:16.080
setting for Box 1.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.880
And then we have the text control.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:23.420
So pretty repetitive but it is necessary.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:30.560
Here we have the icon setting now the icon is going to be just an input for a class.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.910
OK so right here the default is going to be bar chart which will be this icon.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:41.440
So all you have to do is add the correct class name and it'll change that icon.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.070
All right so that's all box one.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:56.190
Next will do box to sew and paste this in a cereal box to heading

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.070
this box to having control.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:13.350
Then we have the box to text setting box to text control

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:20.720
and box to Icon setting and control.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:27.300
OK now we need box three.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.370
All right.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:38.060
So we have box three heading setting and control.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.170
We have box three text

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:48.890
and box three icon which the default is going to be just desktop.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.080
So it's go ahead and save that and go on to reload our custom Mizer.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:58.310
And now we have a box section with all the different fields.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:06.090
Now what I like to do is instead of having functions p p so packed I'm going to just want to cut out

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.650
all of the stuff we just did.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.050
As far as the customize or so from here

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:19.500
all the way down to the ADD action we're going to cut that out.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:26.970
And what we're going to do is create a new folder in our theme called I and see for includes And then

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:35.580
we'll create a new file We're going to call this customize or talk to p p k and paste everything in

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.900
there.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:42.710
Sure we add Pietsch tags.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:52.700
All right I'll save it and then go back to functions and then we just need to require it.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.970
So say require once

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.640
actually was to require and we don't need that.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:12.180
So we'll just say require and then we want get a template directory

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.840
and then slash.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:23.240
I can see slash customize or got ph.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.410
P.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.680
OK let's make sure that everything is still there.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.620
All right good.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.520
So in the next video we're going to show you how to take those fields and all the settings that we just

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.710
created and actually implement them in the front end.
