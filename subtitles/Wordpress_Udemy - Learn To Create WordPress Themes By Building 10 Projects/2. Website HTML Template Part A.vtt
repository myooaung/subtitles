WEBVTT

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.140
All right.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.530
So we're going to get started on the clean cut theme.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.770
First thing we're going to do is start with the H.T. now we're going to create the bootstrap HDMI on

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.890
CSX and then we'll move on to converting it into a WordPress theme.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.160
So Matt get bootstrapped dot com I'm just going to go ahead and download bootstrap

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.020
and we'll open that zip file up and they have a blank folder on my desktop called clean cut HDMI out

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.280
.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.730
That's where we'll be creating the HDMI on site.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:46.150
So what we're going to want to do is create a folder called CSX will also create a folder called japes

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.020
.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.890
And while we're at it let's create the images folder.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.980
OK so we're going to do is get the bootstrap don't see a spring that over to our CSSA file.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.310
Same thing with the bootstrap javascript file.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.810
All right.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.720
And then we're going to create an index page

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.600
.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.870
We'll go ahead and open that up.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.910
And let's also create our style sheet.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.940
So we'll call this style thought CSX and open that up as well.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.230
All right.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.940
So let's get some space age e-mail tags in here.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:46.870
Title and just kind of say clean cut theme we're going to want to bring in the bootstraps DSS as well

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.750
as our custom CSSA file

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.020
cabinets.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.450
Copy that.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:17.190
And actually while we're at it we might as well grab animate Dotsie SS which we're going to use for

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.250
our animations.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.940
OK so let's see.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.780
Download

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.460
Let's save that file

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.820
and then we're just going to cut that and then we'll bring it to our theme.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.270
All right our template folder

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.920
which is

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.870
here.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.760
OK so that'll go in our CSSA folder as well.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.670
All right.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.700
Now for the images you should have an images folder in your project files.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.970
So we have the showcase image the default banner image and then these three smartphone images are going

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.980
to grab all of those and we're going to bring them to the imagery folder.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.070
OK.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.690
So enough to worry about that later on.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.960
All right.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.190
So back to the HVM now.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.440
We're also going to want to include the animate CSSA file

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.210
.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.260
Next think we're going to want is a nav bar so I'm going to go to get bootstrap.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.560
Let's go to getting started.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.250
And then examples and right here starter template.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.830
Just going to look at the source code.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.980
I'm going to grab that now.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.980
Bye.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.070
OK.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.860
Couple of things I want to change now of our inverse to now by default.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.710
That's going to make it white or light gray.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.380
I'm going to keep the nav bar fixed top because I want it to always be displayed.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.190
Project Name.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:14.160
We can change that to clean cut theme and the links I want these to be on the right side.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.040
I'm going to add a class right here called nav bar right.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.310
All right we'll have the home

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.030
we'll have about

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.170
blog

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.650
and some of the stuff might be changed when we actually create theme.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.260
But I think that's good for now so let's take a look

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.050
.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.830
OK so open that up with Chrome.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.740
Looks like it's not seeing the CSX

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.520
Oh let's put a dot right here dot slash.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.310
All right.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.290
So there's our nav bar that looks pretty good.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.150
Now we're going to work on the showcase.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:34.290
So right under the Nav. we're going to create a section and we're going to give this class of Roe and

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.130
also showcase

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.100
.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.040
OK.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.010
Now inside here we're going to have a container

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.210
carrying the container we're going to have a 12 column div

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.400
.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.480
OK then we're going to have a div with the class of showcase content

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.110
and will have an H1

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.800
will have a paragraph from the class of lead.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:40.050
And in here we'll just say a custom word press theme by you.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.820
All right.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.640
And then we're going to have our three buttons.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.500
I'm going to paste those in.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.800
They're not actually buttons they're just links that have the button classes.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.090
All right so let's indent this.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.290
Make it look a little nicer

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.850
.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.090
OK.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.740
So if we take a look at that nothing special yet.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.750
And you can see it's tucked underneath the nav bar will fix that.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.540
Actually we'll fix that right now in the style sheet.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:29.000
Let's say body and we just want to say padding top 50 pixels OK.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.310
And the reason it did that is because we have this set to the Nav. are set to fixed.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.690
So it's always going to be over the content.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.540
OK next we're going to have one of the sections.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.470
So if we look at the actual theme and pull that up real quick

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.840
.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:57.240
OK so we have these these blog posts and what we're going to do is we're going to have this b.s. a with

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.770
the gray background.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.810
This will be Section B and then it'll just switch.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.620
Ok every other section.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.650
So let's go ahead and I'm actually going to just paste this.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.060
OK.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.190
So this is Section A.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:20.400
Basically we have a container with a row and then we have a five column div or six and it's a small

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:20.450
.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:27.810
When it's when the browser is small and then we have the five column over here which has the image.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.950
This one just has the H-2 and the paragraph.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.420
Ok so pretty simple.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.320
And then I'll paste in the next one which will have a class of Section B.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:44.010
Ok same thing it's just the orientations a little different.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.330
And then we'll have one more.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:51.520
This also has s.a and just has a different text and the image is different.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:57.500
OK so we're using the pick one pick two and pick three dot j peg files which you should have in your

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.160
project files.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:05.080
So if we look at it now it should look something like this.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.890
So next is the bottom banner.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:15.350
And I'm going to paste that and right now and I'm not typing it all out just to save some time.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.400
It's nothing really that you guys don't know.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.870
So just doing some pasting in.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.690
So we have a section with the class of banner that has a container.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.540
We have one row here with a six column div with some text.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:37.860
We have another six column div which has a well which has the buttons the way the social media links

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.750
.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.060
All right.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:45.550
So if we save that should look something like that right now obviously this doesn't look very good.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.240
We'll have to style it afterwards.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.590
I just want to get the initial H team out.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.900
So the last part we're going to need here is the footer.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.670
OK so I'll paste that in.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.200
So we're using a foot or tag container.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:08.280
We have a 12 column div here with a UL that has a class of list in line and we just have a paragraph

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.710
with some copyright stuff.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.660
OK so I'll save that reload.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.320
And now the HTL for the index page is complete.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:23.430
So we can now create the About page which will represent the inner pages

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.860
.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:33.760
All right.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:39.260
So let's open that up.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.270
OK and I'm just going to copy what we have in the index.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:47.670
All right.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.320
And then we'll just going to get rid of some stuff.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.600
OK we don't want this showcase.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.720
We don't want.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:04.220
Actually really you know what we all we want here is from the nav bar up and then the footer so we can

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.640
get rid of any everything in between.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.860
OK.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.640
Now we're going to want a titlebar which is going to have the name of the page.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:21.420
Also if there's child pages it'll have a menu with those.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:26.700
So we're going to paste this in Section give the class of Roe and titlebar.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:34.330
It has a six column div with the title and then another six column with whatever that sub nav menu.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:40.850
All right so save that go to about and it should look something like that.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:46.550
So next we're going to have the main content in the sidebar so we're going to paste this in it's a section

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.880
class of row and page.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.500
We have an eight column div that's where the main content goes.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.520
And then a for column div with the side bar.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.260
I'm also using a well class which is a bootstrap class.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:06.300
So if we save that in I can see we have the main content in the sidebar.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:12.770
Now we're also going to have that big area down here with the with the icons and that will be a widget

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.010
.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.490
So we're going to go ahead and paste that in as well.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.860
And this is actually a lot of aged here Miles so if you want to pause the video and kind of copy it

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:28.550
we have a div with the class where using Section 8 to give us that gray background the animation classes

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.480
I'm not going to put in yet.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:36.390
We're going to do that after we have a row with three.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.150
Let's see.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.830
We have six four column divs.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:46.050
Each one has a div with box content left aligned left box icon.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.480
So it is quite a bit of styling here.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.730
So you just want to get that copied.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.230
We have a title we have a paragraph.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.470
And of course we have the icon.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:02.710
All right so that's one two three four five six of those.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.560
OK six four column divs.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.950
So let's save that.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.100
Take a look.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.760
OK so we're not seeing the icons yet because we haven't implemented font.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.400
Awesome which we can do now.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:20.590
Yeah let's do that now.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:24.840
OK.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.050
So we want to click download

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:37.300
and you could use the CD and if you want but I'm just going to get the file so we want to see us and

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.690
we want that file there.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.080
So let's bring that over

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.110
.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.780
And then let's also bring over the fonts folder

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.500
and then we'll go back and we just want to include the CSSA file

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:08.700
area save that reload.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.490
And now we have our icons.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.660
Now obviously they're too small and the styling is incorrect.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.260
But we're going to get to that after.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.020
So now we have the the blog page.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.770
So let's go ahead and create that

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:29.550
.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.390
So the blog Daut aged him out.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:41.300
We'll open that up and we're going to copy what we have in index.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.190
I am going to change a few things.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.090
We don't want this showcase.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.570
So we're going to get rid of that whole section.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.260
OK we will need a titlebar.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.700
So let's get that from the about page

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.020
.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.610
Will just change this to blog.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.490
Then we have our section A's and B's.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.190
So that should be good let's save that.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.870
And that's what the blog page will look like for now.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.110
Oh actually you know what we want to put the matter.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:29.440
The meta info in and the read more so on blog H.T. male Let's go.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.650
We might as well

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.500
know we'll leave the H2 alone we'll just have to read more.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.580
So let's put that down.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.650
We want that on this side.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.900
So right under the paragraph

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:01.150
some bootstrap classes

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.280
.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.210
And I will just say read more and we're going to copy that.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.430
Put that on each of these sections.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:22.640
Right under the paragraph K we're also going to need the matter in Phroso that's going to go under the

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:33.760
H2 space they are in cages to deal with the class of matter.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.770
Right.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.020
All right.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:45.710
So that should be good for the blog page and then for a single that will be the last page will create

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:46.100
here

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:03.560
to HTML and let's open that up

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.900
and then when we copy what we have in the About page

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:23.120
paste that in case we don't want the bottom area here with the icons so we're going to get rid of that

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.640
whole section.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.620
We do want the side bar in sets.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:40.890
Let's change this to post title and then we'll have the post content here we're going to want the meta

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.560
data to go

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.100
right above the content

00:17:52.760 --> 00:18:02.120
.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.210
OK.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.920
And this will also have an image.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:21.680
So let's put the image right above the matter so I will say image source.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.940
See I am g.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.400
Slash.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:30.700
Pick one dog Jay peg.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.130
All right.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:37.860
Let's actually wrap that in a div with the class of post thumbnail

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:46.000
.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:58.470
All right so if we click on read more takes us to the single page which doesn't look very good right

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.170
now but we'll style that in the next video.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.000
All right.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:03.690
Let's see.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:09.020
Let's change the active class in the men you can see we're on the above page with the home is still

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.220
highlighted.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:23.860
So we'll go to about we'll go to the menu and let's take this class active and put it here.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.900
OK will do the same thing on the blog HTML page

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:36.920
.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.470
All right.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.370
So in the next video we're going to do two things we're going to style it.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:49.590
We're also going to add the animation classes so that we can use animate dots ss.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.220
All right so I'll see you in the next video.
