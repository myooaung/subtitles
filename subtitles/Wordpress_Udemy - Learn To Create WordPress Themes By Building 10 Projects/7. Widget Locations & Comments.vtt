00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.690
You guys in the last video I showed you how to create a menu and how to add pages to that menu.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.700
Now what I want to do is I want to show you how to create a widget location theme.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.490
So we're going to have one widget location and that's going to be in the sidebar.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.090
OK.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.480
So let's take a look at index ph P And We have this div here with the class of main.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.130
This basically wraps around the whole thing here.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.760
So what we want to do is we want to go right after the main there the ending div and we're going to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.990
create a div with the class side bar.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.530
All right.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.620
And then what we'll do here is let's just say test.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.070
OK.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.220
So that shows up down here.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.650
Now we want to follow the main div and set up with and then have the side bar float to the right.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.450
So let's go to the style sheet.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.530
And I don't think we oh yeah we do have main right here.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.240
Margin 15 pixels top and bottom that's fine.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:25.670
Let's go ahead and float this to the left and let's set a width of 68 percent.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.410
All right let's see what that gives us.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.200
All right so the reason that this looks really weird is because we didn't clear the flow.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:44.910
So what I'm going to do is we're going to go under the sidebar here and say div class C-L are all right

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.370
and then we'll go.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.740
Our see SS and I already do that.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.220
No I didn't.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.480
So we're going to have a class called C-L are and we're just going to say clear both.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.240
All right.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.410
And then let's add the sidebar class.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:16.540
And that's going to float to the right and we'll set a with of 28 percent.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.220
All right.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.840
Now

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.760
let's see we're going to want to put a container around both of these.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.920
All right because right now Maine has a container inside of it.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.310
But what we want is to take is to remove that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:49.290
and put that above main and then and down here.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.080
All right.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.310
Let's try that.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.610
There we go.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.690
OK.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.920
So now we have the main area and we have a sidebar.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.300
So over here we're going to want to be able to put widgets.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.510
So we're going to go to functions ph P And We need to make it so that we actually can use widgets and

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.350
we want to define what location we want the widgets to be allowed.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.330
So we're going to go down at the very bottom here

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.400
and let's create a function and we're going to call it in net widgets.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.920
And that's going to take in an ID

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.850
and we're going to say register sidebar.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.360
Now we are going to be creating a sidebar widget but just know that no matter where you put it register

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.140
or sidebar is the function that we'll use.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.440
All right even if it's not a side bar even if it's down below or in the head or wherever it may be this

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.220
is what's used to actually register widget locations.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.100
OK that's going to take in an array

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:12.420
and it's going to take a name of that to sidebar and then the ID

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.060
which is usually the same just lowercase and no spaces usually use hyphens.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.100
If there is more than one word.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.880
All right.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:31.340
And then we can also use before widget.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.670
So maybe you want a div a div class

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.060
side widget

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.910
and then we can do after widget.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.090
Actually no this should be an underscore.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:07.500
So after widget that's going to be the ending div and then we can also do before and after title of

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.420
the widget.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.780
OK so we want an H-3 before the title

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.300
right now this isn't going to run yet.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.880
We need to do an action in the hook we want is called widgets in net

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.540
and then we want to put in our function name which is knit widgets.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.200
OK we'll save that.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.810
Now if we go and reload now we have this widgets item on the side and we have a side by location.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:03.750
So let's take the categories widget bring that over.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.890
We can also bring let's say of recent posts we'll bring that over

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.350
and save.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.080
And then if we go to the front end if we reload now we're not going to see anything because we need

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.000
to add it to our template.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.420
So let's go down to our we have the sidebar

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:37.580
and we're going to first check for the widget so it's a THP if.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:47.750
OK so what we're checking is going to be a function call is active sidebar.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.090
And like I said before even if it's not a side bar this is still going to work.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.060
Now the location goes in here in our location happens to be side bar.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.140
All right.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:08.550
And then we're just going to put here dynamic underscore side bar and then the idea of the widget again

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.630
is side bar.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.110
All right I'll save it where you load and there we go.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.920
There are two widgets the categories in the recent post.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:29.130
Now remember we we put the class side widget right here so we can style these using that we say side

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:29.570
with you

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.580
and let's do water

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.250
land having let's say 10 10

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.350
in the margin bottom.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.980
So now if we go and reload now you can see they have a border.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:04.190
Let's do a margin talk to well say margin top 20 pixels

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:19.330
and we go if we wanted to make this look a little better we could say Side widget ally list style none

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.850
.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.370
We could do

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:34.080
wind height two point two Am I could do water bottom

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.710
.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.090
Actually that's two dotted.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.640
And then for the links

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.690
will take away the text decoration

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.750
save and reload.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.020
All right so that looks good.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.660
Now for the pages those are going to be messed up OK if we go to a page.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:13.500
You can see that this is all messed up and that's because in page ph P We still have the container inside

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.570
of main.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:21.150
All right so what we want to do is we can kind of want to just copy what we did what we did in index

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.540
Ficci.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.510
All right we want the sidebar to go right after main and the clear

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.790
K main ends here.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.250
So we want to go there and then container.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.080
We actually want to take that out.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.750
Put that above main.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:53.130
OK make sure that we take the ending div and put that on the outside down here

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.660
.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.180
And let's go ahead and check that out.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.370
OK.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.950
So that looks good.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.220
Single ph P We're also going to have to do that and if we look at a single post.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.230
So let's go there do the same thing.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:24.350
We're going to want this to go right after the main and then we want the container on the outside.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.950
OK we'll take that live here with that down here.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.900
That should do it.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.920
There we go.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.970
All right so all the different formats all the different pages are all set.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.450
They have the sidebar implement it.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.880
And of course if you didn't want the sidebar on one of those you don't have to.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:11:01.660
But since we are if we want to kind of minimize the code a little bit what we could do is put this this

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.470
right here inside the folder.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.820
So if we say cut

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:23.290
save and then on the footer page we add that to the top save and then go into page we get rid of that

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.420
because it's now in the footer.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.240
Same thing with index php.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:35.250
Will get rid of that and it should look the exact same.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.910
All right.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.560
All right so that's good.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.370
That's widgets.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:46.130
Now the one thing that I want to do the one thing left is comments.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.420
OK we want comment functionality.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.110
So this is actually really easy.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:59.170
All we have to do is go to our single dot PDP go where we want the comment which is going to be right

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:08.560
under the and if here and we can just say ph the comments template

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.410
save reload.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.900
And now we have comment functionality.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:27.090
So let's say Great post post comment and there it is.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:27.860
Great post.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.130
It has an avatar.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:35.160
It has the user name the date and also a reply link.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:35.430
All right.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:41.410
Now I realize this doesn't look like the best comments section you've ever seen but that's just because

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.150
it's the default design.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.090
If we take a look at the mock up

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.770
you can see the mock up the separate everything so you can style.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:13:01.760
We have an oh well comment list each ally has a class of comments.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:09.130
We have classes around the author around the v card around the reply.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.290
All right so you can style this however you'd like.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:19.060
Now you can actually replace this whole template by creating a comment dot ph P file and I'm going to

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.430
get into that later on I don't want to do it in this video because this is just pretty much just a very

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.040
basic introductory theme.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:33.940
So the comments are working I'm not going to go ahead and create a custom comment template or anything

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.290
like that.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.340
All right.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.080
So I think that's pretty much it.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:49.440
Like I said there's more we could do we could create a separate template for archived posts.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:54.000
Actually you know what I want to do real quick is the author we have the author's name right here.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.890
I want to make that link and you can click on it and then see all of the author's posts.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:06.460
All right so it's good to index ph P and go to where we have the author right here.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:13.370
And we're just going to add a link around that.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.260
All right.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:29.540
And then in here we're just going to open up ph P and we're going to say get off her posts.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:31.940
You are Al.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:40.000
And then in here we want to pass in another function called get the

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.260
get the author mete out and we want the ID.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.790
So we're going to pass in Heidi.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:50.860
All right.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.060
We'll save that.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:15:01.360
Let's reload and now admin is now a link which I need to change the style because we can't see it.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.000
So it's go to meta

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:13.320
tag and that's going to be color that's going to be white.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:19.530
All right so if I click Add men now that shows us all the posts by admin which are all of them.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:25.990
But if there were multiple users multiple authors that would allow us to see all the polls from that

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.120
particular offer.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.210
All right so we're going to go ahead and wrap this up.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:37.690
Now I realize this isn't the greatest design you've ever seen but the point of this project was to get

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:45.800
you familiar with not just the code but also the structure of the theme what files are included.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:52.210
As you said as you saw there are certain names that we need for the files such as page and single dot

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.380
p.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.790
So hopefully you enjoy this.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:02.680
We'll be using what you've learned in this project and we'll be applying it in future projects and we'll

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.600
also learn more as we go.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:04.900
All right.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.990
So thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next project
