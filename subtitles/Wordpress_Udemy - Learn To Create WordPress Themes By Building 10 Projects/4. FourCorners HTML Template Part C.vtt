00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.860
You guys we are getting there we have the HDMI all done for our age old template.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.870
Now we need to add the CSSA to start to make this come together.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.350
All right.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.440
So we're going to go in our each team for our directory here.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.590
We're going to go into CSSA and then open up app Dotsie ss.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.840
All right so we're going to start from the top and just start with the body and let's make the color

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.580
of our text gray.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.030
And we're going to set the background to light gray.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:50.550
Our links are going to give the hexadecimal value of five a five a five a cane and then we want to style

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:59.200
the hover when we hover over links say color and that's going to be gray.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.530
All right so we have a class of button.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.030
And for that we're going to have this color here

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.130
.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.900
And then let's start with let's go to the top bar

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.880
and then insert the font size to 13 pixels make it a little smaller and also set the color to a dark

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.350
gray.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.000
All right so if we look at the top bar now we're going to want to style these icons up here they're

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
way too small.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.380
We also want to give them a background in space not a little bit.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.750
So it's a dot Tabar dot.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.880
So sure remember we gave that that div a class of social and then thought F.A..

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.290
All right.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.710
So let's make sure the color is dark gray.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.070
We're going to give them a background.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:23.840
Ef 9 if t f 8 K we're also going to give nine pixels of padding.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:36.310
Set the width to thirty five pixels and then I want to align the line to the center.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.530
OK so those looks good.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.940
Now the form has quite a bit of styling song pasted in in fragments.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.730
All right so let me grab the CSSA for just the actual form.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:04.050
OK we're putting a background color and a little darker than in the top bar float left margin with is

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.030
going to be to 40.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.380
All right.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.250
And then for the import the piece that in.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:20.620
OK we're just setting the colors font size height line height padding margin things like that.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:30.000
And then for the button place that in OK we're going to fold it left font size height.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.470
The button is just in is actually an icon.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.090
It's not actual text.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.050
All right so let's save that in reload.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.960
And now our top bar looks pretty good.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:51.000
OK so it looks just like actually we want to want to move these down a little bit.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.790
So remember how we put those in a span tag.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:14.610
So we're going to say top bar span and let's say display block and out of padding top of 10 pixels.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.670
And then there you go.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.550
So our that's our top bar.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.910
So next we have the header.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.990
So for the head or the background it's going to be white.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:40.930
Are you going to give it padding top of 20 pixels and also padding the bottom of 20 pixels and then

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:49.490
border plot which will be gray one pixel solid case.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.630
That's for the head or I'll save it

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.780
.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.800
And let's also add an overflow of audio.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.310
OK.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.140
Now for the menu when I say Daut menu can we go to.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.790
We're going to add margin top 10 pixels.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.080
And let's also float it to the right.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.800
All right now we save that that should move over.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.170
OK.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.670
Now the header should be these should be pushed into the middle like the top bar.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:49.800
I think I forgot the row class so let's go back to the index each now and where we have had or we should

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.580
have a row did great here.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.310
K that acts as a container

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.990
so we reload.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.650
Now that's pushed to the middle.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.920
Now we need to do it to the other age you know pages as well.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.420
So I'm just going to copy this whole header

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.640
and then we'll just open these up

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.130
and just replace the header

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.570
.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.510
A good single

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:51.250
.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.990
All right.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.770
So that's taken care of.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.670
Next thing is going to be.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:04.210
Let's see we have our hair done that's done now post.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:14.790
OK so we want to float left said the width to 100 percent and set the background

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.220
to that and then we're going to take the description

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:33.690
go left and let's add a bunch of padding

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.160
and we're going to set this width to 50 percent

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:55.990
and I'm going to post in a couple other things we have the post description span going to add the styles

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.970
and then the H 3 we're going to add those.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:07:59.840
All right.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:00.990
And then the image

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:13.030
we're going to set to float left and with all the 50 percent.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.570
All right.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.580
And then the button

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.850
space that in K that's for the read button.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.110
Ok we'll save that.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.290
Let's go back and reload and it looks pretty good.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.910
OK the button doesn't work quite right.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.430
Today not had tax

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:42.120
.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.130
See am

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:49.110
.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.290
Each tree read more.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.320
I didn't have the text.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.300
Ok so this should have these buttons should have text of read more

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:12.650
.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:13.630
Here we go.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.830
And you can see they have the hover effect as well.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.380
So that looks good.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.830
Now let's move on to the footer.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:28.150
We'll go back to our C Ss and we're going to paste in some fun styles

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:33.510
.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:41.620
So the main footer itself we have a background color black color of white some padding the icons in

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.570
the footer are going to be white with some margin on the right paragraphs of a line height and A with

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:56.100
H-3 will have a border padding margin and you will have no padding and margin allies will have no bullets

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.160
line.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:07.050
Hate will be 2.2 am and they'll have a border on the bottom reload and there we go.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.130
All right so that does it for the home page.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.070
We click on about.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.590
You can see we have some issues here.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:25.800
I actually want to check out the each team our real quick for about.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.590
OK so let's see

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:44.110
about should not have this post description dev.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.460
So to get rid of that.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.870
OK there we go.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.710
All right so let's style this.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:00.020
This banner area which is this section with the classic title section.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:09.270
So we're going to go to our C Ss and I'm going to just grab this stuff real quick.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.520
OK so Title Section itself background is going to be black.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.120
We get a lot of padding on the top and bottom.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:22.160
Everything's in the center of the H-1 with some margin.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:26.360
The welcome text and the subtext.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.570
Save that.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.200
And there we go.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.830
Now the single page.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.340
I just want to add some margin to the bottom.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:47.970
So we're going to say single page and say large margin bottom 40 pixels

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.840
.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:57.270
See what that show article class single page

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:03.460
.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.570
OK that's good.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:19.540
All right so see the sidebar doesn't look that great so let's add some CSSA for that.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:27.240
OK so we have our well which is going to have a white background some padding sidebar widgets themselves

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.660
have a little bit of styling the list items and the UL.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:34.960
OK.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.880
That looks good.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.010
Now let's look at the blog page.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.040
OK.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.980
So not too bad we're going to fix a couple of things here.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.200
Let's take care of.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.190
We're going to add some margin to the bottom there.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.170
OK.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:13:00.520
Am also going to add some margin auto to the blog post image.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.830
All right.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.640
The matter has a little bit of styling as well so let's go ahead and paste that in.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:07.800
OK.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.910
So we're just selling a with of 100 percent or a lining to the center.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:17.970
That's pretty much it we're adding margin and padding.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.400
Save that.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.140
And there we go.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.130
So that's pretty much it.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.550
Let's look at the gallery.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.990
OK so the gallery we just want to add some margin to the bottom.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:36.980
I'm actually going to add it to where we put in the single page right here.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.180
Let's just add in gallery.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.590
I don't think I added it to the actual HDMI although Oh yes I did.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.590
OK.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.800
So that looks good.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.660
See for the actual image in the gallery I'm going to add some margin to the bottom as well.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:14:04.640
So say gallery image in the bottom of 20 pixel.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.580
All right.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.530
So things are pretty good.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.990
Click on single post that looks good.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:11.280
All right.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.720
I think we're ready to go.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:16.670
And we're ready to turn this into a WordPress theme.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:16.980
All right.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.780
So I will see you in the next video
