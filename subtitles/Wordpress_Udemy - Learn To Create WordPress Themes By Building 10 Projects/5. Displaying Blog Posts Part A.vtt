WEBVTT

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.340
Hey guys in the last part we went ahead and created the theme and added the header or the nav bar so

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.820
all this stuff up here is now dynamic and integrated with wordpress.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.570
But this is all just static aged him now.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.930
All right.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:23.750
So let's go back to our index ph page and go down to where we have this container content div.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.320
And we have these different blog posts.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.450
All right so what are we going to do here is the No.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.500
We have 3 article tags with blog post I'm going to delete two out of the three so that one and that

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.000
one.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.400
All right.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.220
And then I'm just going to cut this these paragraphs down or remove that one and make this one much

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.750
shorter.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.900
Just so we can get it all in the in the page or in view

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.870
.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.380
OK.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.040
So this div is close to that.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.830
So what we want to do is write in this main block div we want to create a post loop.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.420
All right so first thing we'll do is check for posts.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.310
We're going to say if we have posts

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:34.070
and then we're going to end it after the ending article tag.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.520
OK so if there are posts actually we'll put in else as well.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:58.290
And if there isn't then we're going to say p p Teko we're going to use the WP Otto P function and then

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.070
and here we can put the text that we want we'll just say sorry

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.510
no posts are found.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.500
All right.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.070
And then up here we're going to create our while loops so it's Gouraud here.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.630
Open up ph P and put in a while loop.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.060
All right.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.620
We're going to say while I have posts.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.210
All right.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:36.480
And then we want to go and put a colon here and say the underscore post just like that and then down

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.630
under the article tag we're going to end that Waialua.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.110
OK.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.670
So it's going to loop through the post and for every one it finds it's going to spit this out.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.290
All right.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.930
Now we need to make this dynamic.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:06.210
Now for the title what we can do is say ph P the title

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.850
K and for the matter I'm going to just leave the matter for now.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.650
I just want to test it out.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:27.470
So let's go ahead and just replace this paragraph right here with PH P with the contents.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.820
All right we'll save that.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.970
And let's go and reload.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:39.420
OK so let's see we're on the About page let's go back to the home page which we don't have a link for

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.080
.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.460
All right.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.670
And we also want this to go to the home page if I click on it takes us to index each team.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.340
So let's fix that.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.600
We're going to go up here where we have this linked to index each team out.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:03.940
We're going to replace that o c p p u r l and we'll pass in slash case.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.720
OK so now we go and relo we click on here

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.990
is happening.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.540
All right.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.140
So we have to echo it.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.900
OK.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.260
So if we look at these posts we get blog posts one blog post to.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.700
Now you probably don't have these posts.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.310
You probably have the hello world if that's showing up then that's fine.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:46.230
All right if you want to match your content to mine just go ahead and create two posts one blog posts

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.240
one I just have some sample content and then blog post to.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.440
I also have some categories.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.550
If you want to create some categories does it really matter what they are.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.960
Not really we're not really dealing with the specific content.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.350
It's just it's just for a sample content really.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.910
All right so the meta info right here is still static and so is the button.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.730
If I click that it doesn't do anything so let's go ahead and fix that.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.780
So back in our post loop Let's go to where we have P.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.110
Class Matter and was going to separate this a little bit

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.880
K because we need to make some of this stuff dynamic.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.400
All right.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:47.330
So the date and time right here let's get rid of that and then we're going to put in ph P and there

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:54.610
is a couple of things you could use the date but I want to be more specific and have the date and time

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.340
so I'm going to use the time.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.560
All right so if we just keep it like that let's see what it gives us.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.100
OK so it gives us just the time 405 PM.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.610
So I want the data as well so what I want to do is we can format this however we want to I just adding

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.900
some parameters.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.950
All right.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.950
So we want J.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.360
We want the year.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.060
And then we want the time C G call.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.130
OK.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.980
And this pertains to the parameters of the date function.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.070
All right and if you don't know how to format the time you can go to PH P dot net and just search for

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.880
the date function and that should give you all of the formatting options.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.300
All right but we're going to do it like that because now if I reload.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.110
It's going to say the date.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.830
OK the month the day the year and then also the time.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.900
OK.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.920
So that takes care of that.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:05.650
Now we also want the user name of the user that created the post so for that we can just put in ph P

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.970
the offer

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.670
.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.140
And if we go ahead and reload you can see we still get admen because that's the actual user's name.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:26.440
Now we want to be able to click on this name and then have it bring us to all the posts archived from

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.570
that user.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:35.720
OK so that's pretty easy to do as well we just want to put a link around this.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.850
OK and then the link then is say HP Acco

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.400
get author posts you are Al.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.420
And then there we're going to pass in get

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:10.230
get the author meta and then just pass in ID.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:16.510
All right so let's save that and then if we can see that it's now a link we can't see it will have to

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.400
change to.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:25.110
CSS If I click on it it takes us to whatever that user name is author slash author slash and then the

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.130
name and it'll show you all the posts from that user.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:43.310
Let's go into the CSSA real quick and see where we have our meta class which is where is it right here

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:43.630
.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.330
OK so let's grab that

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.830
and we're going to just add on.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.430
OK.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:09:00.060
And then all set color to what increase.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.630
Now that's fixed.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:10.430
Now we can also get the categories that the post is in and we can put those on here as well.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:19.060
So let's go back to the index and we're going to go with C we're going to go right after the ending

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:26.880
a tag of what we just did of the author and let's just put in a pipe character and then open up some

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.390
ph p tags

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.510
actually before the speech tags we're going to say posted in.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.230
And then we want all the categories.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:38.470
All right.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.150
So there's quite a bit of code we need to do here to get this how we want.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.370
First thing we're going to set a category's variable.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.260
We're going to set it to get the category.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:51.990
OK.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:59.960
Now what that's going to do is it's going to give us an array of categories that this post is in.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.690
All right now we can't just take the array and display it so we have to loop through it.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:12.390
So before we do that let's create a variable and we're going to call this separator.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.580
All right.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.640
And we want them to be separate separated by a comma and a space.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:24.340
So we're going to put that and then we're going to initialize a variable called output or just set it

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.500
to nothing for now.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:32.700
All right so now what we need to do is check for categories.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:42.280
OK so say if categories then we want to use a For Each loop.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.860
OK we're going to say for each category as

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:57.800
I'm sorry categories as category.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.120
All right.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.040
And then here we're going to just append to that output variable.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.160
So to append we can use dot equals.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.410
OK.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.920
Now each category is going to have a link as well.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.800
So let's say a graph.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.140
OK we're going to have to do so a little bit of concatenation here.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:26.510
So we'll use dots and then we're going to say get category's link and we need to pass in a parameter

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:26.530
.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:36.860
We're going to say katak can take that category variable and call term underscore ID right and then

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.620
we'll go back into our string.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:48.830
Ok so we want to go right after the double quote here and then we're going to concatenate again.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:54.560
And we're going to say category can't underscore name.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.700
Ok then we want our closing a tag

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.190
in let's see we're also going to add on

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.220
the concatenation gets a little confusing.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.860
Here we want a separator.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.250
All right.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.850
And then down after the if statement here.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.400
We're just going to echo and I'm going to wrap this in the trim function.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:38.070
Make it a little neater when I say output and then the second parameter will be the separator.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.030
Right so let's save that and see what we get.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.310
OK so now you see it says posted in business.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.240
This one is posted in Uncategorized.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:56.240
Now if I click business it takes us to category's slash business and you can see only this post is here

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:56.560
.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.130
This is the only one in business.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.860
OK so that's working perfectly.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.180
Now the last thing we want to do is we want this text to be shorter.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.200
And we also want the read more button to work.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:17.170
So what we can do is go where we put the content and to make it shorter we can just change it to the

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:18.370
excerpt.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:25.060
All right and if we look at that now we have much shorter task now by default.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.770
I think it's 55

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:33.430
55 words but we can change that if we want to go to functions ph

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.600
.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.140
That's a function

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:52.570
excerpt length and all we need to do here is just return a number let's say we wanted 25 and then we

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.000
just need to create a filter.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.650
We're going to say add filter K add action means you're adding something.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.220
Add filter means you're changing something.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:03.760
OK.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:13.260
So we want excerpt length between actually you know what let's call this set X or length.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:17.560
And we'll also add our prefix of EDV.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:17.890
All right.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.610
And then we can actually just take that.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:25.900
Put that here a save it and reload.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:31.720
And now you can see we get 25 right now for the read more to work.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:32.990
That's pretty easy.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:40.760
We're going to go down to where we have the link and we just want to in here save P

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.280
the permalink.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.130
OK then we'll go and reload.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.510
Click on the read more.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.320
That brings us to that particular post.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.300
Now this obviously isn't what we want we want.

All the content here we're going to add comment form and all that good stuff but we're going to get

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.710
to that later.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.060
K we have to actually create a separate template for that.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:16.150
So in the next video we'll do that also show you how we can add a featured image to our posts as well

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.720
.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.440
All right so I'll see you in the next video.
