00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.530
All right guys so we have the H.T. mail for our template.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.410
Now we want to start to style it.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.560
All right so if we go to our style sheet right now we just have the padding top on the body.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.740
So we're going to continue on here.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.650
And you want to style the body as well as all the headings.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.540
OK.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.950
And for those we want to just change the font.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.320
All right.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.470
I'm just going to pieces and we're going to use the lotto or the Ledo font and get that in there.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.360
Next we want the class of lead.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:54.720
I'm just going to set the font size for that image set to 18 pixels and I'll set the font weight to

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.480
400.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.770
All right.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:08.500
So next we have the Showcase area that's going to have all of its text aligned to the center.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:21.510
They will have the color white and for the for the image and the height of the showcase that those are

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.080
going to be dynamic.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.120
So we're going to set those in the Word Press back and.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:34.170
And to be able to customize them we want them to be in the h t m l or in the peach file not in the style

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.530
.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:42.540
All right so what we're going to do here is I'm going to open up index each team now and we're just

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.610
going to put a style tag in the head area and then we'll add showcase

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.480
and we can put the height.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.340
So we'll set that to 700 and then set the background to a u r l.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.910
And and here we want to say Daut slash image slash showcase dot Jay peg.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.590
All right.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.090
And these are going to be customizable in the future.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.710
So let's go ahead and take a look at that.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:30.820
OK so we have our showcase area and go back to the success and let's do the H-1.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.580
So we're going to add some teks shadow.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.840
We're going to change the size and the color

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.660
.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.050
All right.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.960
Let's take a look at that.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.860
OK so that heading looks good.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.920
Now we'll do the lead which is this paragraph right here.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:04.710
So showcase we're going to say P-Dog lead and you just paste this stuff in case same type of formatting

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.900
as the heading just smaller.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.690
Right now I want this to be pushed into the middle more so we're going to take that showcase content

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.120
live

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.120
and we're going to set a width of 50 percent same margin.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:38.480
Auto and let's say in margin top 10 percent.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.250
All right so that just makes it thinner and it pushes it down.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.990
Now these buttons here I think are a little too close together.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.310
So we're going to go ahead and say showcase

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:03.360
showcase a lot between and let's just set a margin right.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:12.030
Twenty pixels right now we don't have the icons here so I will actually want to do that in the index

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.060
page I don't we don't have the font awesome style sheet.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.730
So we're just kind of had that

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.540
.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.630
And then down here where we have these.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.860
OK we already have the Eikon classes so we should be all set.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.120
All right.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.350
So moving along that's good for the showcase.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.720
Now for this we have a section a section B section.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.030
So it's first style section.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.680
We're going to say tatting top and bottom will be 50 and then 0 on the left and right.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:04.280
And we're also going to set the background color to light gray.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.840
All right.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:17.650
And then S. B we can just copy that section b same padding to the background.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.900
Let's see the background color should be white.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.300
Actually no we just don't.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.350
We just won't include it.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:40.440
And we want to set a border on the top and bottom of one pixel solid and light gray.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.770
OK same thing on the bottom.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.950
And then there's also a class of section heading

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:05.620
and I want to just set the margin bottom to 10 pixels.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.030
All right.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.610
So let's look at that.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.300
So Section A and B looks good.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.590
So now for the banner.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.920
OK.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.320
Now the banner is also going to have a custom image.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:27.200
So let's go to our index file and we'll go ahead and just copy that.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.040
Change this to Banner

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.320
and change this to Banner dot j peg.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.630
All right.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.500
And then we also want to add on here.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.520
No repeat.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.160
And then we want to center center.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.060
All right.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.060
And then over here we also have our being our class

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:06.470
and we're going to say padding we're going to do a hundred zero color or be light gray.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.830
And let's say background size cover.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.920
OK.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:22.360
Now for the heading which is an H to set the margin of that is 0.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:32.980
We're going to add some text shadow and also the font size will be 3 m k then for the social buttons

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.200
.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.910
So the banner social buttons

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:48.980
let's say floats right in margin top will be zero.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.610
OK.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.330
Take a look.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.970
That looks good.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.770
Now for the Forder.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:04.000
We're going to set padding 50 on the top and bottom.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.940
Set a background color

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.970
of light gray.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.000
All right.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.410
So that's those are basically all the core styles.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:30.210
Now if we go to a blouse Let's do this titlebar.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.030
So the titlebar

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:45.540
in there will have padding 15 on the top and bottom would say quarter bottom

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.690
and margins.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.080
Actually you know I don't want to do the margin here.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.330
OK.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:10.350
And then for the H one that's in the title we're just going to set the counting and the margin to zero

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.490
.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.290
All right.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.570
So for the sub now we need to style that.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:34.470
So we're going to say Daut sub now and we want to grab the UL and we want to float that to the right

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.490
.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.350
We'll add padding top

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.790
and let's set list style to 9.
