00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.730
All right guys we're getting there in this video we're going to take care of our single post pages.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.610
So let's create a new file in our theme folder and we're going to call this single dot ph p.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.650
And now if I was to click on read more to go to a single post you'll see it's completely blank.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.060
All right.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.840
Now what are you going to do is I'm going to go to the HVM template we created and open up single HVM

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.520
out.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.200
And we're going to grab it's actually before we do that.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.820
Let's open up index ph P And We want this section and we also want to get better and get faster.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.330
So it's paced that and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.820
so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.650
I like that.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.420
All right now we're going to want the while loop to start up at the top because we want the title to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.530
be in the title section.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.590
All right so let's say ph P while

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.510
have posts

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.660
to the post

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.000
and while

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.920
and then let's see in here we're going to want the title.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:53.220
So we'll say ph P for the title and then this here will be the excerpt.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.270
And let's see what that looks like.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.550
OK good.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.520
Now let's go to single age here now and we're going to grab.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:19.070
Let's see this div and there.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.740
Copy that and put that in single ph P right here and see what that looks like.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.980
OK.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.400
So this is all static content.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.290
So what we're going to want to do here

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.840
is let's put in the image first of PH P The Post thumbnail

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.560
that should give us the image OK.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:02.610
And we should probably wrap it in an IF statement to make sure there is actually an image so we can

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.360
do that with.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.100
Has post thumbnail

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:17.520
.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.010
Now the matter I'm going to copy from index P P.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.960
OK that div class matter right here

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.530
and piece that or replace this div.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.900
All right.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.700
And then we'll have our title

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.230
and then we'll have the content

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.910
.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.000
OK so now this stuff is all dynamic.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:08.640
Now for the sidebar we're going to want to check to see if there's a sidebar widget and we're going

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.420
to actually put this above where we have the four column dev like that.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.840
And then it's going to end

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.040
here.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.020
All right.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:28.170
And now what I'm doing is making it so that if there's no side bar widgets enabled then this is going

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.040
to be full with OK the main area will be full with let's see.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.450
So inside of the welded I'm going to take everything out.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.020
And we're just going to paste in our dynamic sidebar function

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:56.390
right now and to make it full with we're going to grab this if statement and go up at the top k where

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.180
we have this a column div and we're going to say if there is a sidebar then this is correct.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.980
We want the eight columns.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.540
All right but if there isn't

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:18.080
then we want 12 columns because we want it to go all the way across.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.820
All right.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.160
And then we can end that.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.300
All right so let's go ahead and take a look reload.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.420
Ok now it goes across the whole thing because there's no sidebars.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:41.570
Now we want this image to be in the middle so let's go to style C Ss and

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.260
see where is it.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.060
Here let's go blog post

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.180
and then we also want a single blog post image

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.450
.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.340
We're going to set margin.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.090
Auto.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:14.350
And what's with to 100 percent.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.030
There we go.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.660
OK.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.280
So that's the single page.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.410
Well actually we need to add the comments section as well so go back to single page P and go down to

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.160
where we have the content.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:41.650
We'll put a line break and then we'll save ph P comments template save k we might as well create our

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.370
common speech file.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.040
We've handled the comments pretty much the same in all of our projects.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.520
We're using a custom template.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.800
And then just styling it a little.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.130
All right.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.830
Now templates very simple this is actually taken from the documentation.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:05.380
OK so if you want to copy that will save it and then I'm going to quickly just add our styles.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:14.020
So let's go to style C Ss down to the bottom and paste in our styles

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.250
.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.600
And now we have our comments section.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.630
Now we're going to do the pages OK if we click the About page it's just showing us index ph P We don't

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:32.680
want that.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:37.400
We want to create a new file and call it page dot HP.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.650
And now that should go blank.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:43.660
OK.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:51.010
And let's copy what we have in single ph P and paste that in.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:58.630
And then we're just going to change a couple things we'll get rid of this post has done now we'll get

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:12.420
rid of the meta div since it's a page and let's change this class to single page type of content.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:19.900
Those can stay Common's template will get rid of that and the sidebar thing this will stay the same

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.020
.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.460
Yeah let's try that.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:26.650
OK.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.170
So there's our About page.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.880
We can actually get rid of this title because we have it up here.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.030
So.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.890
Get rid of that note.

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:39.870
Yeah yeah.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.990
All right.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.150
Services should look the same.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.970
All right so everything's coming together.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.890
So now let's take care of the widgets we have these for widgets we need to add in.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:09:02.840
So let's open up functions that ph P and we'll go right down here and we're going to paste this in.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.670
OK so we have a function called F.C. in widgets passing in an ID we have our first widget which is a

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.770
sidebar before the would you were going to have a div with the class of side widget.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.540
All right the titles will be in H-3.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:23.770
Then we have footer 1 through footer for basically before the widget we'll just have a div and the title

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.250
will have an H-3.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:34.530
OK we're going to use the widgets in Hook in our ADD action down here and we'll save that.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.230
All right.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:42.100
Now before we deal with the footer widget let's let's do the sidebar so if we were to go through the

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.400
about page and you see it's full width because we don't have any sidebar widgets so let's create some

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:55.950
for go to reload and go to appearance widgets and we'll get the categories.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.480
Put that in the sidebar.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.740
Save that and then let's get archives.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:08.950
Save that.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:14.320
Now if we go back and reload now we have our Sidebar widgets.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.540
All right cool.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.160
If we go to a single blog post we should also see them.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.840
Good.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.900
Now for the Forder widgets.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:33.380
Let's go to Forder dot PDP and what we're going to do is just replace this stuff.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:40.330
This will be the first widget I'm going to copy the content here or cut it.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.060
We don't need the title.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:55.870
And what we'll do is we'll go to our back in widget area and bring a text widget to foot our one piece

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.480
that in hopes that's on it.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.560
Paste that in.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.570
So be about us.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.030
All right.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.620
And then in here we're going to paste this in.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.090
OK we're going to check for love.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.400
For one widget if it's there we're going to display it.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.010
All right let's take this next one.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.870
Actually I'm going to copy this and replace that.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:31.900
This is going to be for two and this one here will be for three

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.430
and this one obviously will be for our four.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:46.390
All right now I'm going to copy this I-frame and then delete it delete the hatting

00:11:49.780 --> 00:12:00.230
save it and then let's put a text widget in footer for and that's where our eye frame will go.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.800
All right foot or two is going to have the categories widget

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:18.740
and then four or three will have recent posts.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.060
All right so let's go back and reload.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.620
And now these are coming from our widgets.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.130
So that's going to do it in the next video we're going to create our gallery
