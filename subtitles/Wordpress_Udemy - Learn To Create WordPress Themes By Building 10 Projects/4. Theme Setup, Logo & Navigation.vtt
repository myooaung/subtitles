WEBVTT

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:07.510
Write so now that the team template is done we can now start to convert it into a WordPress theme.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.820
So I have a default installation of wordpress.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.820
And what we're going to do here is we're going to create a new theme folder.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.230
So I have my wordpress installation over here I'm going to go to W.P. content and then themes and let's

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.530
create a new folder and we'll call it my shop all right inside my shop.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.490
We're going to create index P2P file

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:44.050
and we're also going to create a style Daut CSSA file.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.010
OK.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.030
And let's go ahead and put our declaration in in our style CSSA file.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.890
So I'll say the name

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.530
is going to be in my shop.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.790
The author

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.990
can put your name there also.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.440
Or you are out or you are actually

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.630
a description

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.070
and version of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.770
it.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:43.230
So save that and now if I go to the back end here and go to appearance and then theme's you can see

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.000
we have my shop.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.300
All right.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.640
I do have a screen shot that I can pop in there which will be in your project files

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.410
in my shop and just going to paste that in.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.770
All right.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.380
So now we have my shop.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.470
Let's go ahead and activate it obviously right now if I go and reload the front end it's just blank

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.800
.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.400
All right.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.550
So let's open it up.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.650
Open the folder up in Windows

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:32.850
and do what we want to do is also open up the HTL file our age html template that we created which is

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.570
my desk top.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.440
All right.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:47.240
So what's spring over the C Ss and the JSA folder.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.270
Now we have a style dord CSSA in our WordPress site.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:03:00.780
So what I want to do is I'm going to take everything out of the app CSSA folder from our template and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.000
I'm going to put it.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:09.270
I cut that out and I'm going to put it into style dots CSX and save it OK and then we can actually just

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.660
completely delete the see.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.870
SS

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.820
All right.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.060
So now in the index ph P folder we're going to put everything from our index each team mouthfull.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.260
So let's open that up and I'm going to copy everything here and then bring it over to index page.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.500
All right let's save that and if we go to our Web site reload you can see all of our age team is here

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.560
.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.870
OK.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.430
The CEO says this isn't connected yet so we're not seeing that.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.590
But you can see the aged him out.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.990
All right.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:53.760
So let's go to the top of the file and we're going to fix our style sheet declarations and actually

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.940
before we do that we can add our title.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:06.730
So we'll get rid of that and when I say P blog pinfall and in here we're going to put in name

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.650
and then for the style sheets we have foundation.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.500
This one is in the CSSA folder.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:33.380
So what we can do here is say the echo blog and file and in here we want to say template you are Al

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.140
slash CSSA slash Foundation.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.590
And then this one we're going to replace this whole thing here

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.920
with fog and fall

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.130
and here we can put in

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:08.400
a style sheet underscore you l Let's save that reload and I can see that our success is in effect now

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.360
in the head.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:17.730
The last thing we want to put up here is we want to save THP and then we want W.P. underscore head.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:27.960
OK that'll put any extra stuff that is needed into into the head file or into the head tags.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.660
So we're just going to work from the top down the body.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:40.960
We also want to add our body class so we're here let's say DHP go in for the class

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.500
help.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.940
Actually we don't need go

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.130
now for the logo.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.230
We're going to do something that we haven't done yet.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.300
We're going to implement an image and a logo upload from the theme customized.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.950
So in order to do that we need to create a function's file.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:12.010
So in our theme folder let's create a file called functions Daut ph P

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:25.640
and we want to create a function for theme support and we need Pietsch Peter agues here.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:39.240
OK so we're going to say function and we're going to use an M-S prefix for my shop team set up.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.900
All right.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.760
So we're going to say ad

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:54.420
themes support and then and here we want custom custom Dasch logo

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.410
in let's see what else.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:05.240
I think that's good for now so let's create our ADD action

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:23.810
and then here we're going to put after set up theme and then we want mass underscore theme set up.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.680
Save that.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.920
And then let's go to our index page.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.360
And we're going to replace this static image and we're going to open up.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:42.460
So Peter Higgs let's check to see if the function exists.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:55.360
So if function exists the underscore custom underscore will go OK if it exists then we want to run it

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:10.170
right now we can do is go into our backend and in the theme we're going to say customize go to site

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:14.330
identity and now you should have this area here for a logo.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:14.970
All right.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:25.140
And when it clicks like the logo in we're going to find it somewhere it's worth it

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:46.800
and get it right here and select should be able to make this much wider and say Krop image and save

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.310
and publish Snell's go to our front end and reload.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.460
And now we have a logo.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.010
So now let's do the menu.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:04.170
All right so we'll go back to functions of P P and we to go back into the M-S theme set up function

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.220
and we want to set up nav menus.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:19.590
So say register underscore nav menus and in here we're going to have an array

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.410
and let's say primary

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.240
and primary menu.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:48.000
Now save that and go to index ph P and we have our menu right here.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.150
I'm going to just get rid of it completely

00:09:53.830 --> 00:10:01.590
and then we'll do ph P W P and the score Nav. underscore menu.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:07.230
And inside there will have an array

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.700
right.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.050
And let's say theme location

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:27.330
which will be primary and I'm also going to add a container class

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:41.650
and that's going to be on the menu simple and main nav.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.000
OK it's just going to add the classes that we had before.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:57.750
All right now I think yeah that should be good so I'll save it and then let's go to our backend and

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.520
I'm going to go to.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.300
First of all we'll reload.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.060
Now we should have a menu option so click that.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.080
Let's see going to

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.660
get rid of that keep the sample page.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:15.970
All right.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.790
And make sure that you have this primary menu checked.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.570
OK we'll say save menu and reload.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.250
And now we have our menu.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.140
OK and if I click on it you can see the links changed.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.500
You won't see it down here because we don't have that area of the themes set up yet.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.640
It's just static content for now.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.200
But the menu is working the logos there.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:45.870
Last thing I want to do in this video is just before I forget I want to go down into the water and see

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:52.640
right underneath the footer tags would put W.P. underscore Forder.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.600
All right save it.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.390
And that should give us the admin menu up top.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:03.300
All right so in the next video we're going to be working with these widgets.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.280
I'm actually going to show you how to create a custom widget for our showcase area.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:08.550
All right.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.040
So I will see you in the next video
