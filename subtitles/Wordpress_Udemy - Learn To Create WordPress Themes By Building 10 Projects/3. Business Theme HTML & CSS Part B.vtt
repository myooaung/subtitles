WEBVTT

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.170
Make guys in the last video we implemented bootstrapping our age to email template and we created the

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.630
index each team out.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.020
We haven't done the styling yet but we're going to hold off on that for now.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.310
And we just need to create a couple more pages for our template so let's create an example of an inner

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.090
page.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.680
OK so one WordPress this will be just a regular page.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:37.170
So I'm going to call this about dog age Tim Kaine and we're going to open that up.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.730
Is that right.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.990
OK you open that up with sublime and we can also access it from the link about each team.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.420
So what I'm going to do is copy everything that's in the index.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.220
I then it's good and save it.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.210
So we're not going to want the Jumbotron here so let's just completely get rid of that.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.240
OK.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.540
Get hell out of there.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.040
We're also not going to want the boxes.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.430
We don't want this section either.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.510
Get rid of that.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.190
And these two areas the content regions these can stay.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.840
All right.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.960
Now we're going to want that title bar area so let's create a section of it.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.790
Actually I'm just going to copy this

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.400
and paste that in and we're going to get rid of these classes here.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.050
The only class I want is Roe and then titlebar.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:52.050
OK that'll have a container it'll have a 12 column div and in each one K which will have the page name

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.420
.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.410
In this case it be about us.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.280
OK.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.150
Now we're going to need an area for the main content.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.160
So again I'm going to copy this section

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.720
paste that in and we're going to have row and then marketing.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.470
Will have a container.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.760
It's going to have an 8 column div for the main area and then also a side bar column which will be for

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.050
column div.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.660
The main column will just be the content.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.890
So just going to paste in a couple of paragraphs.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.510
I also just put a link here to go to a contact page that doesn't exist.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.830
All right.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:48.600
Now in the fork home which is the sidebar I'm just going to paste a couple of things in here.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.520
OK so we have two divs with the classic side widget.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.600
This one has an H three and a paragraph.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.470
This one is the categories and has an unordered list which has the class of list group.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.040
So let's go and save that and click on about and you can see we have our content and then we have the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.700
sidebar.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.340
Let's also change the active class on the menu.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.090
So that's correct.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.930
We're going to take class active off of the home and put it onto the boat.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.060
OK so now when we see when we visit a boat that's the correct the correct link is highlighted.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.190
So that's pretty easy that's the inner about page.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.850
Now for the blog page let's create that.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:45.120
So we want to create another document here and we're going to call this blog it's called Blog dord HDMI

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.070
.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:56.970
OK and then what we'll do is copy what we have in the About page and then paste that in blog.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.200
All right.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.130
And then let's go up to here.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.480
The change is from about us to blogs

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.890
and the sidebar can stay the same but we're going to change what we have in the 8 column div.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:24.920
All right so we're going to have an article tagged and is going to have the class of post.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.320
Right.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.100
And let's do two columns per article this one will be five.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.320
Call themselves they call him the.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.640
And then do call and the seven.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.260
All right.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.150
Now the five call him Dave will have the image as well as the read more.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:58.010
All right so let's put an image source should already be in there.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.400
It's called Blog 1.8 big.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.220
OK.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.220
And then right under that we're going to have our link.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.310
This is going to go to a page called single dog aged humoral and then we're going to give this a class

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:23.400
of BATNA between primary and then and between walk

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.410
in and the texts will just say read more.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:38.550
All right so now in the 7 column we're going to have our UL with a class of Metta.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.940
OK this is going to be all the meta data.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.970
OK so list item let's say by admin

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.150
and let's see will have the D or same may 11

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.890
.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.190
And then we'll have the category let's say a business.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.640
All right.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.830
And this is going to be a link so we might as well put that in now.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.120
It's going to go anywhere.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.960
Yes.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.660
OK.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.780
Same thing with the author.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.170
All right so that's the meta data.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:41.440
Now under the well we're just going to have a heading and a paragraph or two I'm going to paste in.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.810
All right.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.740
Ends the blog roll obviously we'll have a bunch of posts.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.470
So when we do I'm going to put a divide between each article just to clear everything out.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:07:04.920
So we're going to call it a C O R and then I'll just copy this article and I'm going to just paste it

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:14.460
two more times and then what we'll do is let's change the image.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.740
Ok this one will be blog to dot J peg.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.310
And as this one will be blog three.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.690
All right.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.930
So let's take a look at that.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.640
All right so the image obviously that's looks horrible.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.790
Let me just fix that just for now.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:51.030
So if we go to our CSX and say Article dot post image set the wealth to 100 percent.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.910
There we go.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.380
All right so that's good for now.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.950
The last thing we have is the single page.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:06.930
All right so let's go and create that will create a new file called single

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.320
dot aged him.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:15.720
All right.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.060
And then we'll open that up

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:26.940
and I'm going to copy what we have in blog and paste that in single.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.960
And then what we'll do is what we only want one of these articles.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.570
OK so the first one is right here.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:45.460
So let's grab these two under it and delete them.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.090
OK if we click read more that brings us to single.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.270
Obviously this isn't what we want so

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.320
let's see in the article we don't want to have to call them.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.990
We just want one.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.750
So it seems to put 12 column.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.300
And then we can just get rid of this.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:14.610
All right.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.800
And then in the 12 column div

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:20.760
it's

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.960
actually no we don't even need a call we don't even need this right.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.990
First thing we're going to want here is the image.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:39.090
So it's the image slash blog one dot jpg.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.530
That's the image.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.730
Next we'll have the matter

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.470
.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:58.930
They actually have this copy that from wog.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.260
OK so that's the matter.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:13.500
And then under that will do a line break and then we want some content.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:24.230
So I'm going to grab this text and then here will put a paragraph paste this in a couple times and I'll

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.140
do one more

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.920
.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.330
OK.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.800
And I think that's going to be it.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.920
So save it and go back to single.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.350
And that's good for now.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.590
All right.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:50.670
We're not going to do the comments oh I want to change the active class and the links on both the single

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.230
and the blog page.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:59.070
Okay we just want to take off class active from about and move it to the blog ally

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:05.520
.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:17.760
All right so now we have reached him all done in the next part we're going to add the CSSA and make

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.210
this look a lot better.
