WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.660
OK so in this project we're going to be building a photo gallery theme for wordpress.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.810
Now before we get into anything that has to do with wordpress I want to just create a layout in each

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.350
team.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.040
All right.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.370
And as I said in the introduction we're going to be using the W3 C Ss C as a framework.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:29.880
All right so first thing we're going to do is create a new folder and let's call this and call it photogenic

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.360
underscore HVM now.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.780
OK.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:43.340
And then in there we're going to create a couple of files we're going to create index each team.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.220
We're going to create a style dot CSSA file

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.910
and we're going to have a folder called images.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.680
OK.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.300
And then one more thing we're going to have another aged him age to all file that's going to represent

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.630
the single image once we click on one of the images in the gallery it'll take us here cells called a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.850
single HDMI out.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.730
OK.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.590
So let's open up the index page with Sublime Text or of course whatever you'd like.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.150
And we're going to just get a base.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.850
Each team will structure here.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.760
And the title will say photogenic.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.850
Now since we're using this W3 CSSA framework we have to include that style sheet.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.270
So you're just going to use the CD and hear souls say Link we're l equals stylesheet.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:08.200
And then a Tref is going to be HTP and is going to be from the W three schools website.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:16.550
I want to go to slash lib and then slash W3 dot CSX.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.770
We also want to include our own CSSA file

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.900
select style Dotsie SS.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.770
OK no that's really all we need in the head.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.450
So next thing we want to do is let's create the header.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.490
OK so we're going to use each five header tag and some of the stuff might change and once we are actually

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.710
building the Wordpress theme just to adapt to the Wordpress conventions.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.690
So this hetter we're going to give this class actually if we take a look at the documentation here for

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:09.480
the framework and we go to containers which should have headers radios is what we want.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.680
I want it we want this.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.610
Just going to copy that.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.040
Put that there.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.290
All right.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.240
So let's just make sure that everything is actually working so far.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.150
So we'll open this with chrome and there we go.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.980
So we have our heading now we're going to want to do is we want to use the grid system.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.650
All right so if you use this or if you've used bootstrap or foundation or any one of those C Ss HTL

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.100
frameworks then you know what the grid system is basically it gives us 12 columns across.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.200
Now we can set certain divs or certain elements to span across a certain amount of columns.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.700
All right so if we go to our documentation and we go to the grid you can see here the syntax we need

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.780
which is this.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.170
So what I'm going to do is just copy this row and we're going to put this right in the head or I'm just

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.350
going to replace this for now.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.450
Let's push that over.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.190
And then what we want to do is for this div here we're going to change this to l 9 this is for large

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.650
9 so if it's a certain if the browser is stretched a certain with this will kick in and then medium

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.110
.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.920
This will be if it's if it's smaller but we're going to just put the same for both nine columns and

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.450
then this one here will be three.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.820
All right.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.460
We can get rid of these paragraphs inside of them and this one is going to have the heading.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.980
So this will be an one and this is a photogenic.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.640
And I just want to put a span around the word photo because we're going to make that a different color

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.200
.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.770
OK so that's the heading and then on the other side we're going to have our input and that's going to

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.460
have its own class of W3 input.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:14.870
OK we'll give it a type of text and then we'll give it a placeholder.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.690
And that will save search.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.750
All right so let's take a look at that.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.280
OK.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.480
Alex good.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.140
I do want to bring the search down so let's go to our CSSA file

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.880
which is right here.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.600
Let's see what I want to do.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.010
We're going to say Hetter input.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.790
Let's do Marjan talk.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.190
I'll save 15 pixels.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.500
OK.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.560
There we go.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.410
So that's our hetter.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.780
So next we want the sidebar and then the main area.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.040
So we're going to use the grid for that as well.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.280
So what I'll do is copy what we have here.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.310
We're going to put that down under the header.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.490
OK.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.970
Now as far as the columns we're going to just switch these.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:31.760
This one is going to be three and this one is going to be 9 K because we want the sidebar on the left

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.760
and then we can just get rid of the content inside.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:44.470
OK so four of the three call them we're just going to have a list of categories so let's do ul.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:50.350
And we're going to give it a class of W3 ul.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.670
And then inside that we'll have allies

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.550
with links

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.960
.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.060
This one will say nature.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.300
And these are just going to be categories.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.150
Let's

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:33.990
say people and I'll say abstract.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.100
OK so let's save that.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.360
Take a look.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.300
OK so there's our categories.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.910
Now we want the background to be black and the text to be white.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.860
So it's going our style sheet and just add some coarse styles here.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:08:02.340
So first thing will do the body and we'll give it a background of black and color of white.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.120
Right.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:10.100
And then for the links I want to take I'll take the underline away so we're going to see text decoration

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.130
.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.740
None for our allies.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.500
I don't want to have any bullets.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.630
So we're going to say list style none

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.120
for the input we want the text to be a dark color.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.510
So it's a color.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.900
And that should be good.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.100
Let's save that.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.600
And there we go.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:47.290
Now for the main area we're going to put another grid inside of this one.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.740
All right so we're going to need three images in a row.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.570
OK so what we'll do is let's grab

00:08:59.480 --> 00:08:59.840
this.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.970
Again this row with the with the columns.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:09.460
And we're going to put this inside of you one of the inside of this div.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:18.050
All right so I'll paste that in and then get rid of the content OK and then we're going to change both

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:23.270
of these two four.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:23.790
All right.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:29.060
And then we're going to need one more so I'm going to copy that sat in.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:36.710
OK so that'll be three columns so we need an image inside of there and then also the this the text underneath

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.760
.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.600
Now as far as the images go you should have those in your project files.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.700
I'm going to put them in right now.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.050
OK so these are just some black and white images.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.830
I'll show you them real quick K and they're just named one through 6 J peg.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.240
All right so let's go back to our code editor

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.480
and what we'll do

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:10.280
is let's put in our image tag and we're going to point to each one so this will be source and then that's

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:17.850
going to go to images slash 1 dot pig.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:18.290
All right.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:27.380
And then we also have a paragraph underneath which I'm just going to put some simple text in.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.580
OK so we're going to need to do this for all of our columns

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.550
K and then we're just going to change the number here to this one to three.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.270
So that should give us 3 across.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.510
OK it's not seeing them let's see images source

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:56.020
.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.830
There we go.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.600
OK.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:04.790
Now what we need to do is set the width of these images to 100 percent of their content because right

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.270
now they're there busting out of their container.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:16.610
So in the style sheet we're going to say image and we're going to set the width to 100 percent.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.700
All right let's see what that looks like.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.420
OK.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.280
So that made them all fit nice and neat.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:28.150
So in order for us to get more we're going to have to put in some more rows so what I'll do is I'm just

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.330
going to copy these four divs.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:31.840
I'm sorry.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.310
These three divs.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.670
Will copy those and just put that right underneath.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.010
And then we'll just change the numbers of the file names here to 4 5 and 6.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:53.670
Ok so now we have six images now down at the bottom we just want a simple footer.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:12:03.020
So let's go down there and we're going to go after the last div here and then say footer and then just

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:11.680
put in a paragraph we'll say photogenic and we'll do a coffee right.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.590
Single single symbol 2016.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.240
All right.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.180
So let's save that.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.830
And then in the stylesheet we're going to say.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:45.300
And we're going to do a text align Center put a margin top of 40 pixels in a border top gray and then

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.850
solid one pixel.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.630
All right.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.640
And for let's see

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.890
I want to center the text here as well.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:06.580
So what we're going to do is with each div with the four columns also going to put a class of pick.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:16.170
All right just so each picture div has its own its own class.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:20.670
OK.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:30.170
And then we'll do is in here we'll say the dot pick and let's say text align Center.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:30.450
All right.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.210
So we'll save that.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.980
And now we have our text aligned we also have our footer.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:44.470
So in the next part what we'll do is we will implement the animation and we'll also create our single

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.180
daughter each DML page
