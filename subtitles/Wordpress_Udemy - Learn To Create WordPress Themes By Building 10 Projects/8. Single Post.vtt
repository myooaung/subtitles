00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.290
All right.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.750
So we're almost there almost done what we want to do now is the single page OK.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.320
That's that's all we have left of this theme.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.160
So if I click on one of these it takes us to the correct place but it doesn't look too good.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.340
All right we want this to look like the single aged female page that we created.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.370
So what we need to do is in our photogenic theme folder we're going to create a new file and we're going

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.730
to save it as single dot ph page.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.690
All right.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:37.080
And what we're going to do is go into index ph P and get a copy what we have there pasted in.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.460
All right.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.630
And we want to remove this part right here.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.420
Get template part.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.560
All right this is where we want to put our article that that we created in our single dot age html files

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.880
so let's open that up.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.270
OK and what we want is everything that's in the article tag here.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.310
So we're going to grab that whole thing copy it and then we'll go to single dot page.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.980
We're going to paste it right in the while loop.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.810
Ok so now we need to make these fields dynamic.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.140
OK.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.950
So let's start with the matter since that's at the top.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:27.900
So let's replace 2 pm with PH P for the time.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.290
And then this right here will place with the date.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.490
And this is one of the best things about Wordpress is that the ease of including Pete's dynamic content

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.090
.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.230
All right and then this right here actually that's grab that from content.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.570
HP that's kind of long.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.900
We're going to grab this hold this line right here

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.600
and just replace the name

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:11.610
so that makes the meta data dynamic and then down here we have just a static image we obviously want

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.340
to get rid of that.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.030
Let's copy what we have in content gallery which is

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.600
what grab this whole thing right here.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.820
If Post has post thumbnail which ends right here.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.750
OK I will grab that and we're going to replace this image right here.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.340
OK I'll paste that in.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.430
And we're going to change it from opacity

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.850
to what was it right.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.120
Think it's W3 enemy right.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.350
And we can get rid of the hover thing here.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.820
All right.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.610
And this doesn't need to have a link.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.930
So we're going to get rid of that in that.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.710
OK.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.830
So that looks good.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.630
Now down here for the Back button we're going to change it from index HVM now instead of that we're

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:28.830
going to say HP What was it I think it's echo site underscore you RL That should work.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.270
OK that will take us back.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:39.320
And then we need a dynamic title so we can simply use the title.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.690
And then for the content

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.950
we can do ph P to the content.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.770
All right.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.320
So let's take a look at that.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.050
OK.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.010
So that looks good.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.520
That button works click on either any one of these and you can see it just slides right in.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.730
Perfect.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.000
All right.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.010
So I think that does it for our theme.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.130
It's very simple but I think it's pretty elegant.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.890
And of course if you wanted to add widgets in the side bar you could do that if you want to create regular

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.420
posts you can also do that doesn't have to be photos.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.450
So that's it.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.970
All right.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.860
Thanks for watching.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.720
And I will see you in the next project
