00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.130
You guys in this video are going to show you how to do two things.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.170
To show you how to create a single post.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.070
K if we click read more it goes to the single post.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.550
But it's not what we want.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.380
We want to change that.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.050
And also we want the ability to add an image to a post a featured image also called a thumbnail.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.140
All right so let's start with the thumbnail we're going to first go to functions of P P and we need

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.140
to enable that support for our theme.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.750
So let's go into the ad theme support function and let's say featured image

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:52.290
support and we all we have to do here is say add themes support and then just pass in here post thumbnails

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.790
just like that.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.590
All right.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.070
So save it.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:04.440
And then if we go to a blog post one you'll see down here we have this featured image block.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.540
So I'm going to click on that to set the featured image and we're going to upload some files.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.810
Now you should have a folder called underscore images.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.610
I was just going to go to mine.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.570
All right.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.860
And should have a couple images in there I'm going to choose this phone's image and set that as featured

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.350
.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.220
And then is going to set this to technology for the category.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.700
All right.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.980
And will say update.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:50.030
OK let's go to blog post to set featured image upload and I'm going to grab this surface.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.660
All right.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.840
And let's go ahead and update so if we go to the front end then reload.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.380
You won't see the images we actually have to add that to our theme.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.890
So let's go to index PSAP and find out where you want to put the image.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.220
I'm going to put it in and put it right above the x.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.080
Right.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.910
And we're first going to check for it.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:24.190
So when to p p f has post.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:41.840
All right so if it does then let's just create a div and I'm going to give it a class of post from now

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.800
.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.930
All right.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:56.260
And then we just want to go in here and say ph P that post from now.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.300
OK.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.650
Let's go ahead and save it and go back and reload and now you can see we have the images.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.910
Now they're a little too big.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:15.630
So what we can do here is let's go to ICSA us and I'm going to go to where we have our article styles

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.640
in say article

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.450
Article Daut

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.620
post thumbnail

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.200
.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.280
And then we'll just actually needs to be the image so we're going to say I'm g.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.100
So half the width to 100 percent.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.240
OK so now it takes up 100 percent of the div but the proportion is all out of whack so will say height

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.730
.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.110
I'm going to set height to auto reload.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.150
And now they fit OK that looks good.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.250
So now we want to move on to the single page single post page which is this.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.390
So to do that what we'll do is we'll set a new file and we're going to save it as a single dot ph P

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.810
and are just going to type in the word test and then if we go back to our single post and reload you'll

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.880
see that we're getting that test because this page has now overwritten the index page on the single

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.490
post.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.420
OK you can see the main page still shows it's just when we go to view a single post.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.340
So what we can do here is let's copy everything that we have in the index ph P file.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.650
All right.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.390
Actually you know before we do that I just realized that we haven't split this up into a header in a

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.880
former file and that's what you typically want to do with a WordPress theme.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:59.550
So what I'm going to do is create a new file and save it as hetter dot THAAD and then create another

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.510
one called for her dog THP.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.660
All right so in our index page file let's figure out what we want to bring over to the header.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.980
All right.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:17.100
So we want the actual header the navigation and I think that's it.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.970
So let's start with this nav and go up and we're going to cut everything out and we're going to paste

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.190
it in the header file.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.150
Now down

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:37.470
at the bottom of index ph P We're going to get from the ending HCM I'll tag up to where the footer starts

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.530
.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.130
I'm going to cut that and we're going to put that in our footer file.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.130
OK.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.660
Now if I save index as is and we try to view it you can see that it's all messed up.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.480
So all we need to do is at the top

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:06.720
we're going to say THP get Heller and then at the bottom of course we're going to do get for

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.600
if we go back.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.900
Now everything's back to normal.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:25.170
All right so now we want to do is take everything from index ph P including get header and footer and

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.470
then we're going to paste that into a single ph.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:34.150
We save it and then if we go to a single post we get what we had before.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.390
So let's change a couple things.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.460
So one thing we want to change is we want the hold all the content to show.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.860
So we're going to set the or back to the content.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.350
All right.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.880
And if we reload now we get all the content.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.050
We also don't want the read more link.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.840
So we're going to go ahead and get rid of that

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.510
a reload and now you can see that that's gone.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:11.310
All right so now we just have our single post now the archive pages should should work if we click on

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.370
business.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.290
It's going to show us all the business posts.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:21.150
I click on Add and then it'll show all the posts created by admin and even the search should also works

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.700
of say larm and show these two articles show up.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:33.210
Now all the things they just showed you search and the category and user archive pages we can actually

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.700
customize those we can make those different from the Main Post style.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.600
So that's all we're going to do in the next video
