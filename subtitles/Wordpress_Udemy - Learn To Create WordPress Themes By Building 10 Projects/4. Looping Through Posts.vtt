WEBVTT

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.070
Or it's when the last video we created the two files that are required which are index Pietsch P and

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.040
style that's VSS we created the code.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.280
The common block in our style sheet we also created the base of each team all in the head tags along

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.280
with some of the dynamic code that we can use in wordpress.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.350
We're going to do now is go in the body and I'm going to just add some very basic HDMI cable we're going

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:39.240
to create our tag which is an age to you know five tag and let's put in H1 and in each one I want the

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.710
web site name.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.590
Now remember we use this piece of dynamic code in the title we can actually take that and put that in

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.300
the H-1 as well.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.110
So now if we save that and we look at our front end we get this WordPress dev.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.480
All right.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.260
Now if we wanted to change that we could go to settings in where we have the site title we could change

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:12.360
this to say my web site save it and now that changes to my Web site.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.480
In addition to the name we can also include this tag line.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:28.740
All right so to do that let's go and we'll create a small few small tags and then here we want that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.620
blog info.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.020
But instead of using name we want to use description.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.270
All right now if we go and look at that reload and see if we get just another WordPress site.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.230
OK which is coming from here.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.520
People say the best Web site ever

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.320
and there we go.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.630
All right.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.860
I'm actually not going to put that in small tags.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.310
Let's put it in a spin

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.930
.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.570
OK so let's add more HVM.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:25.440
Here we're going to go under the header and you'll see a div class in the main.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.830
All right.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.100
And what we're going to want to do now is we're going to want to fetch our blog posts and wordpress

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.740
uses something called the loop where the main loop and that is all your blog posts.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.600
It will fetch every blog post that you have.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.090
OK.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.240
And regardless of the category or whatever it may be without specifying any restrictions it's going

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.820
to get every post.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.480
So first thing I'll do is check to see if there are any posts.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.720
So we're going to use an if statement for that and I'm going to use the shorthand.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.740
All right.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.570
Now you could just as well go like this.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.260
OK but I prefer to use this syntax so that we can quickly go in and out of PH p.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.560
All right so we're going to say if you have underscore posts.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.540
OK so that's that's checking to see if there are any posts in wordpress.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.430
All right and we probably want to put in the else here as well.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.380
All right.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.880
If there are no PPOs then we just want to let the user know.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:46.640
Now instead of just spitting out text we're going to use a function we're going to say Echo.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:55.380
WP auto P and what this does is it takes double line breaks and automatically makes them into paragraphs

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.430
.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.160
All right so it's a good function to use when you just want to output text.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.030
OK so we're going to say sorry

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.740
no posts were found.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.850
All right.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.100
And then here let's just say very.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.440
This is just temporary.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.230
Well say post-fight.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.060
All right so let's go and reload and you can see we get posts found.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.900
Now if we go in our back end goal posts in C we have.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.310
Hello world.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:34.500
Let's go ahead and move that to the trash and if we go back and reload we get SARINO posts were found

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.730
.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.220
All right so we know that that's working.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.120
Now let's go into the trash and just restore that

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.120
OK.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.170
Now obviously we don't want to just tell the user that they're there or post we want to display them

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.200
.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.850
So let's go back into here.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.200
Get rid of that and we're going to use a while loop for this.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.180
All right.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.770
Actually we need a speech tag.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.990
OK.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.100
So we're going to say while I have underscore posts.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.020
Ok now with wordpress it we have to use this thing called the post.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:24.050
So right here we're going to say that underscore post which is a little weird as far as the syntax.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.870
I don't I've never really seen this anywhere else aside from WordPress but just know that you have to

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.330
have this as well.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.820
Right.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:39.500
And down here we're going to say and while again this is just using shorthand syntax you could just

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.470
use the curly braces.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.440
What we're gonna do here is when it finds a post we want to get the title.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:06:01.490
So I actually put this in and H-3 handles a Ph P title which is a function.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.230
Go and reload.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.990
And now you can see that it's getting the hello world title.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.880
Now just to just for example let's go ahead and create a post.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.510
And so we'll call this my blog post.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:25.530
And let's just get some sample text.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.680
Ok so I'll go and paste that in.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.910
Let's make this a couple paragraphs

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.800
.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.620
OK then let's publish.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.140
Now if we go on reload you can see it gives us my blog post.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.020
Now to get the actual content will go right under this.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:09.170
And let's say Pietsch P the content K. You can see word Pritt word press makes it really easy in terms

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.490
of the names of the functions.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.540
OK so now that's giving us each blog post content in the splaying.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.720
Now you probably want the date.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.370
OK there's different things that will want to display the date.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.240
Maybe the author categories things like that.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:35.230
So let's go right under the title and we'll put it in the div we'll give it a class of Mella

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:52.890
Karen and let's say created by and then we want the author's name so we can say ph P The author

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.870
crack reload and you can see we get created by admen.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.640
OK that's the user name of the person that created the post.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:18.600
Now if you want the date we can say created by the author on and then we'll say p p the day C see that

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.770
gives us k created by admin on May 13th.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.170
So it gives us the date.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:24.770
All right.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.210
Now you can format the date in a lot of different ways.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.500
If you know ph P and you've worked with the date function you know that there's a lot of different formatting

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.370
options.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.340
So let's take a look here.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.950
So these are all used to format dates.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:52.850
I'm not going to go through all of this because it's a lot there's examples down here.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:58.940
For instance let's grab this.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:07.050
OK we can take that and we can actually put that in the day as a parameter.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:15.020
OK let's see if that gives us and you can see now we get this format with the day the date the time

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:15.560
.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.940
PM or am.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.500
OK so there's a lot of different ways you can format it.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:26.970
One thing that I like to do is I like to use the time instead of the date.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:33.930
Now if you just use the time like that it gives you just that the time doesn't give you the date but

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.500
you can actually format it to give you the day.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:46.310
OK so in here we'll say Jeff lowercase j.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:53.510
Y for the year and then for the time we'll say gee Cole and I say all right.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:10:01.050
And if we take a look at that gives us the date and the time OK so it's all up to you it's all preference

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:01.650
.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.430
So before we go let's just get a little a little bit of styling going here.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:12.120
Now I'm going to add a footer to the bottom here.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:20.280
Put a paragraph in here and we can actually make this dynamic.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.210
Let's do

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.840
a copyright.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.150
And then for the year instead of just typing in the year

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:40.620
we can use the date and then just pass in as a parameter y.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.360
If we look at that.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:57.570
So we get copyright 2016 and then if we want the site name we can just say for log info and pass in

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.350
the name.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.700
All right so now we have a dynamic footer.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:13.320
Now just to add some base styling Let's go to the style sheet and let's do body

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.840
font family.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:26.250
Now the idea of this this whole project actually is not to create some great looking theme I just want

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:31.560
you to get familiar with the code and how themes are set up.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:39.410
It's a font size 15 pixels color.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:47.190
Dark gray say background like.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.680
And then we'll take the header

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:59.270
and let's see let's do background.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.710
We'll make this darker

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.780
and make the color white.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.260
Make sure the each one is white

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.610
and we'll add some padding

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.530
for the body.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:32.490
Let's say margined 0 and paddings 0

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.370
and head or each one.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:47.210
I'm going to set margins 0 0

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.600
and let's say that the line height of the body to 1.7 am

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.080
all right.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:10.230
Now the reason you see this up here this space is because we're logged in as an admin.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:15.530
So even on the front end it knows that it's trying to display the admin bar.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:20.320
Now it's not displaying because we don't have the special function for it to display.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:27.160
So let's go to index ph P and then down right before the body the ending body we're going to say ph

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:34.800
P W.P. underscore for K and if we save that and go back and reload.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.240
Now you can see that we have the admin bar.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:39.910
All right.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.280
I'm actually going to add a little padding to that each one on the bottom

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.240
and then let's add a container div

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:14.700
you see container with will be 10 20 pixels and set margins to zero auto and overflow.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.000
Auto Right.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:25.110
And then we'll go into the header and say div class container

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.800
.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.620
It will do the same thing in the main

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:51.720
and in the folder.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.500
OK so now everything's moved in the middle.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:08.760
And then let's add a little bit of styling to the folder and just copy what we have here in the header

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.250
.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.910
And we'll text aligned to the center

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:23.900
.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.760
All right.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.860
So a little bit of margin to the main div

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:35.290
.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:47.780
OK so now you can see that we have our head or we have our main area where we're looping through the

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.320
block through the post displaying them.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:57.890
And we have our footer now common practice in wordpress is to break the header and footer into their

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:01.140
own files and then include them in the index.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:02.280
So that's what we're going to do.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:11.420
We're going to create a new file call it Hetter dog THP and then create a new file called for her dog

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:20.130
to be OK and then let's go to an index and we want to go from the very top down to where the ending

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.240
header tag is going to cut that.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:34.140
And then we're going to replace it with PH p get underscore hether go to head or ph p place that n save

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:39.570
it and then Same thing with Forder we're going to get from the bottom up to where the footer starts

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.170
.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.420
Cut it out.
