WEBVTT

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.700
All right guys we're going to go ahead and start on the four corners each team template before we get

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.650
into making it into a WordPress theme.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.180
Now we're going to be using a few different libraries for the template reusing foundation as our main

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.990
CSSA framework.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.580
We're also going to use Fonte awesome so that we can have access to some nice clean icons and then we're

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.860
also using something called hover Dotsie SS which is is a small CSSA library that will allow us to create

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.390
hover effects and you can see all the different examples down here.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.400
OK.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.810
So let's go ahead and create a new folder for our template.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.140
OK we're just going to call this

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.050
four corners underscore each team out.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.630
All right.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.370
We're going to create a few things here.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.110
Let's create a CSSA folder.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:06.840
Let's create a javascript folder folder for images.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.090
OK.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.120
And then we're going to go ahead and grab Foundation.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.000
We're going to download it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.380
.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.210
All right.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.390
And we're going to bring over some files so in our CSSA folder we're going to bring Dotsie SS and foundation

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.980
Dotsie SS and then the J.S. folder.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.310
We're going to bring over app Jay as in the vendor folder.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.090
All right.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:50.360
And then for index each team out what we can do is bring that over as well whoops will bring that over

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.080
but we're going to change quite a bit.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.450
All right.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.660
Now for fun.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.170
Awesome.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.380
We're going to grab that as well.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.180
OK we're going to bring over the Fonts folder and then the CSSA file.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.800
And if you want to use the mini fied version that's fine as well.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.120
OK finally we need to grab hover Dotsie SS click download on get hub.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:26.730
Let's go ahead and just download the zip K and then we're just going to grab just the hover dot CSSA

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.830
file and bring it over to our CSSA folder.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.170
All right.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.010
So that should be it for third party libraries.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.890
Now if we open up index each time in the browser it looks like this.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.500
All right so let's go ahead and open with sublime text and we'll change some stuff here the title will

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:55.450
just say four corners theme for template.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.700
So we have our foundation CSSA and our APS-C SS being loaded.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.690
We're also going to want some other stuff here.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.380
OK we're going to want the fun.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.470
Awesome.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.700
We're also going to want hover darts.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.180
Yes yes.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.750
All right.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.170
APS-C this is what we're going to use for our custom styles that we create.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.940
All right.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.080
Now I'm going to go ahead and just get rid of everything in the body.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.390
OK.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.800
You know it's not needed except for the scripts at the bottom I'm going to keep those.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.050
All right.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.410
So if you save this and we look at it we just have a blank page.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.020
All right so clean slate.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.400
So we're going to start with the top bar.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.380
So let's create a div and give it a class of top bar.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.490
All right.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.270
And then in there we're going to have a div with the class of rho.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.970
OK we'll be using the grid system and let's do a three column div.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.530
If we take a look at the finished template

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.320
we have the social icons this is going to be a three column.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.120
This will be three.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.480
There are actually the will be three columns will have four three column divs.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:34.110
So we'll say div class large three columns

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.850
.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.960
And in this a little bit.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.390
And let's copy this three column div three more times.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:56.160
And the first one I'm going to also give the class of social and let's get those icons in there.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.730
So we're going to have a link around them.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.000
So this one will have a class of F.A. are fun.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.790
Awesome.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.260
A dash Facebook will give us the Facebook icon.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.280
All right let's copy this

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:37.130
a change this one here to Twitter this one will be linked in this one will be Google Plus.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.960
And this one will be YouTube right now in this column.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:54.450
Here we're going to have the phone so I'm going to put a spin tag in here we're going to have our icon

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.480
.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:03.140
So it's going to be an eye tag you're We're going to give it a class of a f a dash phone

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:12.120
and will say phone 1 800

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.310
OK in the next one's going to be free in e-mail address.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:31.060
So it's a place that in and change this to envelope for the icon and then changes to e-mail.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:39.400
And then we'll change this phone number to something at something dotcom.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.010
All right.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.890
And then the last one is going to be the search box.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:53.820
So let's put a form here and in the form will have an input with the type of text and we're going to

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.620
give it a name of ass or search given a placeholder

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.120
and just say search.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:17.710
All right and then right next to it we're going to have a button a button type is going to be submit

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:25.850
and which is going to wrap that around in the icon.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:33.790
OK so the icon will be face search.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.900
All right.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.350
So that should be the top bar on.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.850
Take a look at it it's not going to look awesome yet.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:47.160
All right it does have the gray background just because we gave it the class of top bar which is a pre-defined

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.120
Foundation Class.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.540
All right so let's see.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.550
So that ends there.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.670
Now we're going to create our Hetter.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:05.770
So when you use age 2 or five terror tags and so let's see what are we going to do here.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:11.300
We're going to have two columns one for and 1 8.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:21.330
So say div class equals large four columns.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.000
Right.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.240
And then we want in a column right next to it.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.340
OK the four columns for the logo the eight columns for the menu.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.780
So here we're just going to have an H.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:42.000
Three people say four corners and it's actually it's put a link around that

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.130
we want that to go to the home page.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.420
Right.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.330
And then for the menu we're going to have you well with the class of menu

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.720
in let's do allies

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.980
links.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.670
So go to index our age himself

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:12.590
.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.530
All right.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.600
And then we're just going to copy this.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.190
So we'll have home and then we'll have about

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.570
then we'll have a gallery

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:40.450
and we'll have a blog.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.100
All right.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.270
So let's save it for you load as our header does.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.030
Again doesn't look very good but we'll fix that later.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:58.280
So after the header we're going to have our main home page post area.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.680
All right so we're going to wrap these in Article tags.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.160
All right.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:11.340
And then let's do actually let's give it a class of post.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.250
All right.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:21.870
And then we're going to have a div and this is going to have a class of post dash DGSE for a post description

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.560
.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.390
And inside there will have a span and that will have a date

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:39.130
K under the spin will have an age three with the title.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:48.960
After that we'll have a paragraph I'm just going to play some dummy text in K

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:06.050
and then under that paragraph we are going to have an aged three tag and then have a link inside that

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:18.940
and we're going to give this a class of read button or read DTN and also read more between.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:27.450
And we're going to be using a hover Dotsie SS So we want to include a class to add an animation.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:34.260
So each V.R. dash bounce dash out.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.840
And if you look at the documentation for hoverboard see SS you'll see all that stuff all the different

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.600
classes you can use.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.070
All right.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.480
Now let's see after the description.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.970
We're going to have a div with the class of post.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.380
I am g.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.150
And then and here we'll have our image.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:05.970
Now you should have a folder called underscore images in your project files you want to bring that over

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:11.150
to your your template image folder.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.550
So I'm just going to paste in these if we take a look.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.710
Pick one two and three are going to be for the home page.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.560
Post one two and three will be for the blog page.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.490
All right so let's go ahead and put in source equals i g.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.280
Slash

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.350
was a pick.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.480
Pick one.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.090
JPA.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.080
All right so if we go and reload.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.370
That's what it looks like for now.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:54.320
Now we want to copy this article and post it two more times.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.700
OK.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.440
We're going to change the name of the image that one will be too.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:08.330
This one will pick three and we can change the title a little bit.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.890
All right.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.390
Now remember every other one.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:21.780
We want the image to switch sides so all we have to do is the middle article we're going to go to where

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:27.530
I post description is we're going to put in here a class called float.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.270
Right.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:28.620
All right.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.180
And that's all we have to do to make it switch to the other side.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:33.480
All right.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.940
Obviously right now it's not going to but once we do styling.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.520
All right.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.030
So it should look like this.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.350
So far.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:49.320
So let's move along with the index page so down below the last article we're going to we're going to

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.980
put a clear fix class here because we want to clear the floats.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:59.950
And this is a class that foundation provides.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.720
And we want to end the div there too.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.100
All right.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.470
And then we can move on to the footer.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.680
So as a former Lidsky of the class of main for

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.440
right in then and here we're going to have a row

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.420
and we're going to have four or three column Debs.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.460
So day of class.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.970
Say large three columns

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.800
.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:55.970
And we're going to do an H 3 here and I'm just going to copy that.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.970
And then we need three more.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:04.300
Ok this first one is going to be about us.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:13.850
And this is to just going to be a paragraph and some social icons are going to just paste that in.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.110
OK this one here is going to be categories.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:25.240
And I just have an honor an ordered list to paste in.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.200
OK same thing here we have

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.520
one.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.590
This can be recent posts

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.910
and I'm just going to paste another list in

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:49.320
and then this last one is going to be our location and that's going to be a Google map.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.140
I-frame I'm going to just paste that in.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.910
Well OK.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.500
So that looks good.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.840
Let's go ahead and save it and reload.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.860
And now we have our footer down at the bottom.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.760
OK none of this looks very good because we haven't done any custom styling.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:16.530
So what I'd like to do is in the next part we will add the inner pages because we're going to create

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:23.910
the About page gallery page blog page and then a single blog post page and then we'll move onto the

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.750
