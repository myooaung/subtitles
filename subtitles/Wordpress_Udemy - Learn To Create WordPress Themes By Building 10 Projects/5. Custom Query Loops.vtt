00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.270
All right the last video we set up our main post loop for this recent news area.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.250
This is all coming from WordPress.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.400
However down here these are all just static content.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.540
So let's start with the featured stories.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.360
Basically what we wanted to happen is for any posts that are labeled as the featured category or labeled

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.690
in the featured carob category those will show up here.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:35.850
So let's open up index BHP and let's go down to our featured stories area and we're going to want to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.910
go right where the owl is.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.090
We want to go right under that and then we're going to create a while loop with a custom queery and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.390
then spit out a list item for each loop.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.650
OK.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.940
So we only need this one.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.530
We can get rid of these other ones down here.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.670
So right up to here.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.170
All right.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:07.460
And then what we'll do is right here we're going to say THP let's create a variable called featured

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.060
queery.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:18.730
And that's going to be set to new W.P. underscore queery.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.370
And then in here we're going to have an array and it's just going to have one option that's going to

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.670
be a category name.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.370
And then we're going to set that to featured.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.450
OK and then we can do our while loop.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:53.250
So I will say ph P while featured queery have posts and then we want to do

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.090
pre-chewed queery the post

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.670
and then we can end it down here

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.610
.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:27.610
Save it all right now just to make sure it's working let's change the title here to PH P the title.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.640
OK.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:37.320
Now let's go back to the front end and then these titles here should change so let's reload and I can

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.040
see that it has a different title.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.970
And if we scroll through they all have different titles.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.340
So let's do the image.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:56.670
OK so we can copy what we did up in the regular loop for an image which is this the post thumbnail copy

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.210
that

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.610
put that there.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.220
And then for where it says BBDO we can grab the date using the time function

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.340
and then we can grab the X or

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.110
with that here.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.980
Right.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.850
So save that.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.460
Now if we go back and reload you'll notice that the image is too small.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.900
So the reason for that is because we're still using or is it this news thumb.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.750
So what I'm going to do is change this to news large save it and then go into functions P P and we're

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.540
going to create a new image size called News large.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:58.060
And this is actually going to be 790 by 380.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.900
So now we'll go back and there you go.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.440
So notice only the featured images are featured posts should be showing.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.810
OK.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.390
Now for the popular again this consists of creating a custom query.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:26.280
So we're going to go back into index go down to where we have our popular and let's go right under this

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.890
UL

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:41.670
and we're going to create a variable called args and set that to an array K and then in that array we're

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.450
going to have

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:56.790
we'll do order by and we want to order by comment content.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:10.510
OK we also want the posts per page and we're going to set that to three.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.900
All right.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:21.750
And then what we're gonna do is create a variable called popular queery and let's put that to new W.P.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.700
underscore queery and then just pass in the args.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.620
All right and then we can do our while loop.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.570
Let's get rid of all but one of these list items.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:44.500
OK there's only three so we'll get rid of two and then we'll do our while loop.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.020
So say while popular queery have posts

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.360
and then we want to do.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.050
Popular queery the post

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.690
and it down here

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.740
and let's change where we have the image.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.910
We're going to get rid of that and replace it

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.570
with p p.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.300
The Post thumbnail.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.150
OK.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:38.930
And we're going to create a custom size for this called news popular.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.430
All right so let's go create that for I forget

00:06:51.910 --> 00:07:00.870
and this is actually going to be 300 by 150.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.100
Save that.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.030
Now this one actually doesn't have a title.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.750
So I'm going to put that in.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:17.940
So this paragraph we're going to get rid of that and then we're going to do with the title

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.060
and the x or

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:37.340
K title is going to be wrapped in H force and then we also want to link around the title.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.270
OK so the link is going to just go to PH D.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.210
The permalink

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:54.160
.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.680
All right.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.940
And then next to the title I also want to put the number of comments.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.480
So we'll go right after the a

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:16.900
let's do ph P comments underscore number and then we can pass in a couple parameters here.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:23.160
First one is going to be no responses that's if there are none.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.620
Second one will be if there is one response

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.770
and then the third one will be if there's multiple responses which we can use the percent sign as a

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.750
placeholder.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:46.000
OK so let's save that reload and there we go.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.220
So with none of them have any comments yet.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.680
But once they do this will be ordered by the comments.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:55.050
All right.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.500
Awesome.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.180
So the last part we need to do is down here and this is going to be the business post.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.060
OK anything with the category of business.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.160
So let's go back to our index page go down to the last part here

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:19.420
and I'm actually going to put a heading right here and we'll just say new in business

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:25.290
.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:25.590
All right.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:33.180
And then we're going to go right below the UL and actually you want to copy what I have up here with

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.700
featured so this and then even the while loop

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.380
ok will just change this to business

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:54.260
.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.980
OK and then we'll end it

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.850
and get rid of the rest of these allies

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.160
.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:14.600
Okay.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.510
And then for the image let's copy what we have up here

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:26.460
.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.450
OK.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.810
This one has a class.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.360
It says a class of half bottom space.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.370
Actually let's copy what we have up here with the feature.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.090
So this

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.010
all right.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.070
And then the title

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.100
the date

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:04.820
.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.480
Put that right there and then we'll have the excerpt

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.150
.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:20.850
All right.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:21.840
So take a look

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.390
see.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:34.910
Don't I have the correct size News large that needs to be news.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.680
What they call it news thumb.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.280
Yeah.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.090
There we go.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.440
So these are all the business listings.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.050
OK so we have all the flag posts.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:58.680
We have the featured posts the popular posts and then the business posts.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.930
So that's our homepage.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.960
So now if we click one of these posts actually you know what this appear

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.860
these need to have links on that title.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.140
So let's go back to the featured

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.010
in where we have the title.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.560
Let's add a link

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:32.060
.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.970
Wrap that around that.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.880
See what that looks like.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.150
OK.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.320
So other was the feature.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.960
All right so that's fine.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:54.930
Now for the top ones.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:13:02.550
Find the title in all just wrap the link around that as well.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:13.560
Let's do the same thing for popular we already did it and then we need the business ones as well.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:19.450
So it's the title.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:20.580
All right.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.180
So now we can access the single posts.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.640
So if we click on that single post page looks absolutely horrible.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.970
So that's what we'll be working on next.
