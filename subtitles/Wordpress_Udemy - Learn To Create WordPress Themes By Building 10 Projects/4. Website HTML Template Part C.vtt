WEBVTT

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.760
All right and then for the allies

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.600
for the allies you also want to float those to the left and we're going to set a padding right of 15

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.400
and also padding left

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:34.440
and then we'll do water right which will be one pixel like gray solid.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.570
All right.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.250
Now we don't want the last one to have a border.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:50.210
So what we'll do is we'll say sub nav light and then we'll use the pseudo class of the last child.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.690
OK and then we'll just set border to zero.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.820
So take a look at that.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.710
OK that looks good.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:08.830
Now the single page I think they put a class of page around it.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.020
Take a look.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.660
Single what's good to about.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.390
OK.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.750
And you know we have the class of page.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.050
So I want to take that class and just add some padding

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.730
.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.610
So do padding 20.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.180
0.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.540
OK.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.010
And that should also be in effect for those single blog posts.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.920
Yep.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.620
The image here I want data to go 100 percent.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.710
I think we did the class of Postum now.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:03.570
So I want to set post thumbnail image with should be 100 percent.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:12.520
All right so now let's do the metaclass.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.460
I'm just going to paste this in K margin bottom fonts are going to be bold border top border bottom

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.420
and then some padding.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.450
Let's add some margin to the bottom of that image as well.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.010
And I'm actually going to just make sure that that class is only in effect on the page.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:49.880
So it was a margin in the bottom 20 pixels shields to 25 and then set the height to Otto.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.810
All right.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.320
So now for this part here at the bottom there's quite a bit of markup as you saw.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.290
OK so that is this area here we have all these boxed content.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:19.790
So the mark this quite a bit of CSSA as well so I'm going to just paste that in Kerry so starts right

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.470
here.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.240
Box content left a line we have boxed content left align and then the icon.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.220
OK so if you want to just copy that or just get it from the project files we reload.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.490
Now that looks pretty good right now.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.440
The banner should also be on this page.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.470
So let's grab that from the index

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.510
and put that in the About page right above the footer.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.870
OK.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:04.920
Now the

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.550
you know the image isn't showing up because we have that on the index each I'll page up here.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.130
So what I'll do is copy that will also put that in the main stylesheet for now.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.230
So go to air we have banner

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.120
that shows just grab that.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.640
Put that

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.410
up.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.990
We're going to fix the location.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.040
It should be dot dot slash.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.830
OK.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.080
So the blog has it.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.230
Let's see single post doesn't have it.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.420
So we need to put it there as well.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.900
That's right

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:18.710
.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.210
And there we go.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.980
OK.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.610
So this is looking good.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.880
The last thing we're going to do is add the enemy classes.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.460
OK so we want this showcase to fade in.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.220
Now if you want to see other classes you can go to anime don't see SS dot.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.390
We're not exactly sure of the URL.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.990
OK.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.140
So it's this this you are all up here and you can see all the different effects here.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:57.960
If you go to the good hub page it has all the documentation all the different effects and all that.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:06.210
So what we want to do is go to index HDMI I'll go to our showcase just right here and we want to add

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:13.500
the class animated and then whatever the effect in this case it's going to be phased in and that's it

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.330
.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:22.740
So off we go and reload you can see it fades and now it comes in kind of fast if you want to change

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.680
options you can actually do it in the stylesheet.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.020
So if we go to where we have our showcase I think the default is 1 second.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:39.590
So we're going to change it when we say animation duration and we're going to set that to two s

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.770
OK so that slows it down a little bit.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:51.340
Now these Each side is going to come in from for instance this will come in from the left this will

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.770
come in from the right.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.250
Same thing down here so what they do is go to our section A.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:08.260
Inside of our index which is right here and we want to go to this this stive here and say animated.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:20.620
And then when you say fade in left or right and then the other div which is this one here actually you

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:33.790
know what we want to put it on the image so on the image tag we want to add the class animated and fade

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.750
in what is right feed and right.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.820
All right so let's check that out.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.500
OK that looks good.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.990
So the next one we're going to go to this class here.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:56.750
Same thing and say animated fade in the left and then on the image class.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.750
Fade in.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.470
Right.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.010
So you see how easy this is.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.210
And you can do it to virtually any element on your site or application

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.510
.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:32.360
And I did the wrong direction for the middle one section b c so Section B.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:42.750
This one needs to be right and then this one should be left.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.390
There we go.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.530
All right.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.100
So we want the same thing on the blog page.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.110
So let's go to blog page here now

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.390
and add those classes section a

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.450
feed in the left.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.760
It's going to copy that

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:29.850
.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:40.210
This one will be feed in right at the top and then this one will be feed and left OK and then this last

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.620
one

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:51.550
.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.630
All right.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:01.060
Now on the About page we want this part to come in from the bottom and the side bar to come in from

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.380
the right.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.840
So it's go to about in and.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.790
We want this right here.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:18.070
That's going to be phased in the bottom.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.950
Well that and more.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.940
Oh it's feeding up.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.150
You want the direction it's coming in.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.200
There we go.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.670
And then for the side bar

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:47.470
which is right here we're going to attach to this well Div. and this will be feed in left field and

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.740
right

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.590
now

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.290
and then we go Christ.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.220
Now we have our animations.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.020
So that's it for the age template in the next video.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.360
We're going to try to incorporate this into a WordPress theme
