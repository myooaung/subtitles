WEBVTT

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.510
All right so we have our age team now template done now what we want to do is take this and convert

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.670
it into a WordPress theme.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.150
So I have a fresh install of Wordpress here with just the default 2016 theme.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.530
So what we're going to do is go into the Wordpress directory go to W.P. content and then in the themes

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:31.880
folder I'm going to create a new folder in order to call this advanced W.P..

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.980
And there we're going to create a style

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.680
CSSA file and also an index ph file.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.480
OK let's open the stylesheet and then we're going to put our declaration in here so that WordPress can

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.010
see the theme.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.270
We're going to give it a name.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.740
Theme name will be advanced W P and let's give the author

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.150
to offer you our eye

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.440
and a description

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.990
and a version

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.830
.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.360
OK so there's our declaration.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.110
Now I do have a screen shot as well.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.430
So I'm going to go and add that.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.140
Now you should have this stuff in your project files.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.430
So what's the C-Drive I'm using amps.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:08.970
So I want to go to my WDW folder and then W.P. themes content themes and then advance W.P. and just

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.640
going to go and paste this in.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.500
OK it has to be an image called Screen Shot.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.680
P and G.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.750
And now if we go to the back end of word press then we get to appearance and then theme's you can see

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.430
we have the advanced W.P. theme so we're going to go ahead and activate that.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.460
And obviously if we go to the front end reload we just have a blank white page.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.800
All right.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.670
So let's go into index start ph P X you know before we do that let's let's add the styles.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.230
OK so we can go ahead and grab the CSX.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.360
So if we open the style dot CSS from the HVM all template.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.080
And I'm just going to grab all of that.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.200
Copy it

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.890
and paste it right in that style sheet.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.770
OK.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.360
Save all that and then in the index P2P file.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.160
What I'm going to do is copy everything from the index each team I'll file

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.010
and we're going to paste that right in there.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.470
All right so if we save this and we go and reload the front end we're going to see all the HD mouth

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.100
Salak HD mounts not seeing the style sheet though because we don't have to go into the right place so

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.040
we want to go up here we have this link and we want to get rid of this style CSX.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.830
And then I just opened up some peach peach tags and we want to use blague info.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:58.270
And then and here we just want to put a style sheet underscore you are l.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.190
Can I save that.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.530
It's still not working.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.730
Oh I misspelled.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.000
OK.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.120
So now the CSSA is being read.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:21.380
Now all this stuff we're looking at here is this static content in the eight in the index P2P file.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.990
It's not actually coming from WordPress yet.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.380
So let's do a few things here.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.560
So the best thing to do is to just start at the top and work our way down.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.150
So we're going to go into this age team tag right here and we want to put in here the language attributes

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.720
function

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.110
and age like that.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:05:04.050
And let's see we want the title let's get rid of this and we want to say the blog info and here we want

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.230
to put a name

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.790
can also put the character set met a tag.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:21.990
So say metor char set.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.790
You really can use that blog in full function here and just pass in char set.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:44.830
All right now let's see we also want the W.P. head function here so that will save ph PWP underscore

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.350
had

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.450
a.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.230
It looks good.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:59.870
Let's also add a viewport is a metal tag and give it a name of viewport.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:11.420
It will set the content attribute to width equals device with.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.000
And let's see we want to put a comma here and then set initial scale

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.530
and scale are going to set to one point zero.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.620
That just helps with the responsiveness of the theme.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.080
So in the body tag we want our body class function

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.720
body class

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:54.630
all right now for the the logo or the heading here which is this right here this part we're going to

00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:03.710
get rid of the static text and I'm going to say ph P blog info and here what we want is names.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.460
So the same is where we put in the title.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.400
And then is the tag line here.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:22.550
We can also make that dynamic by saying blog info and then pasand description.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.130
OK the search form is pretty easy.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.300
We're going to just take this form tag and add some stuff to it.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.890
Let's say method equals get.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.530
And then we need an action which is where it's submitted.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:47.250
And for that we're going to say ph P and we're going to use the skate u r l function and then we just

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.320
want to parents in the home you are l.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.000
And then just pass in here a slash

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.560
A and then we want to make sure that this input.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.560
Want to add a name attribute and just set that to s.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:05.870
All right.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.790
And that's pretty much it.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.640
The rest would get taken care of by word press.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.710
So let's save that and look at it so far.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:13.920
OK.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:21.330
So we have our logo here which is coming from WordPress same thing with the tag line search.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.850
We can't really tested yet because we don't have any any dynamic content down here.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.450
And I see that we have this white space here.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.780
The reason for that is because we don't have the W.P. for our function yet which is going to put the

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.360
admin menu there.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:45.270
All right so I guess we could go and add that if we go down to the bottom and we're going to go right

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:54.250
after the closing for our tag and we'll just say W.P. underscore footer.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.130
All right.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:01.290
And if we save that and reload nag and see we have our ADD and bar.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:01.620
All right.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.910
So let's go back up

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.160
and now will do is take care of the menu.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.020
OK.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:17.910
So let's go down here to where we have our Navman you know what we're going to do is just get rid of

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:27.900
this whole UL tag and all the allies and we're going to first create a variable called args and we're

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:36.750
going to set that to an array and then this is just arguments that that can be passed into the W.P.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.560
nav menu function.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:45.350
And we're just going to have one for now which is going to be the location of the menu.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.720
So we'll say theme location.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.700
And we're going to set that to primary.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.220
All right.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.330
Now down here

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:09.830
we're going to call W.P. underscore the Nav. underscore menu and then we just want to pass in args.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:18.890
OK so if we go on look at it it is working here but we do want to specify in our functions file the

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:24.460
the different menus different many positions in our theme and we're going to have to.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.820
So let's go and create a new file.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:37.640
We're going to save it as functions DHP and we're going to set a function for theme support

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:57.210
so save function and let's call this say a DVD is a prefix and then team support.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.860
OK.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:03.310
So all of our custom functions will have the EDV prefix.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:13.620
OK now we want to register them now when I use it.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.380
We're going to pass in an array

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:28.980
and we'll put our different positions here so that we have the primary and we can pass that to a readable

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:36.560
name so we'll say primary the menu and then we're going to have another one in the footer and just going

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.230
to put that.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.670
Get that out of the way for now

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:50.530
.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.040
All right.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.290
And then underneath the function we're going to say add action.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:03.180
And in here we want to say after set up theme

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:11.020
and then the function we want to run is a divi underscore theme's support.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.080
All right let's save that reload.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.550
OK so our menu is now here.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.020
If we click on it you'll see the change.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.750
Now you won't see any content change because this is all still just static h T.M..

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:31.260
All right but we do have our menu now by default every page that we have is going to show up here.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.640
All right now your pages might actually be different.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:42.500
You probably don't have our team because I just I did a little bit of work on this WordPress site earlier

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.900
so your links may be a little different.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:51.630
All right now what we can do is if you look under appearance we didn't have a menu option but since

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:57.270
we added this to the functions file if we reload now you have a menu link.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:06.540
Click on that and you'll see that down here in the locations we have primary and Forder because we added

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.640
it in the functions file.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:14.760
So what we'll do is let's check primary in for menu name.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:22.400
Let's just say main menu and you can put whatever pages you like.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:29.340
We're going to put a blog is going to put them all actually just to show you that we we don't have to

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:35.600
have them all leave one unchecked leave RTU unchecked and then save menu.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:40.580
But I'm sorry you need to click this ad to menu and then save menu.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:46.390
And now we go to the front end you see we only have about in sample page.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:53.760
Now I'm going to do is just create a couple pages just so you have the same pages as I do.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:14:04.410
So we have an About page which just says this is the about page in our team page now for this I actually

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.210
want to choose the parent of about.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.260
OK we'll update that.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:16.850
And then let's create a new page and we're going to call this fake hue.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:25.310
OK and this is also going to have the parent of about and you'll see why we're doing this later on.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.810
And then let's see we'll create another page called services

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.220
and that's not going to have a parent.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.960
All right.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.650
And let's add services to the menu.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:46.760
OK.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:51.930
I'm not going to add AFAIK you or our team just yet.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:57.630
OK I'm going to show you how we can use sub menus.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.190
We're going to do that later on.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.670
So let's go ahead and save that.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.190
And then your menu should look like this.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:11.820
All right so we're going to go ahead and stop here we have the now by Don we have the head or done the

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.960
search box and all of our styles.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:23.760
So when the next video we'll move on and we'll start to create our main blog post loop and we'll go
