00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.590
In the last video we created the age team around CSSA for our home page.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.720
Now we want to do is we want to implement the animation which is going to be very simple.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.560
We're using our W3 CSSA framework which has built in animation.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.680
OK so if we take a look at this page.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.420
This is the different types you can have coming in from the top bottom left and right we can fade in

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.720
.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.310
We can zoom and we can spin.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.190
All right so what I want to do is the photos here on the home page.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.780
I want these to fade in.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.270
So what we'll do is take a look right here and this is what we're going to need.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.590
We're going to need this class and we're going to put this on each image.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.630
OK so let's grab this.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:55.140
Copy it and go to our index page and on each image we're going to paste this in

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.570
.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.110
So let's go ahead and try it and I can see that it just feeds in right now on the single page.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.700
We're also going to use an animation.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.570
So let's go ahead and create that.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.600
OK so we're going to open up

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.060
a single dot each team.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.630
We're going to open that with sublime.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.230
All right.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.690
And then what I want to do is I want to link each of these images to that that page.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.240
So actually we'll just link the first one.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:50.050
So let's see we're going to put a tag here that's going to go.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.550
That's going to go to single dot aged him.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.880
You could put it for the rest if you want but it doesn't really matter.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.540
This is just the age to all this isn't the actual theme.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.890
OK.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.960
So now that's going to go to single HTML.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.830
So I'm going to do is copy everything that's an index aged him out and put it in single.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.970
OK.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.700
And then we'll do all this stuff is going to stay the same.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:29.480
The categories what we want to do is empty up this nine column div..

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.220
So we want to get all this.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.250
OK so this is where we're going to put our single image.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.920
So we're going to put in the article tag here.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:55.910
OK and let's give it a class of host and then we're going to have a paragraph with the class of Madoff

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.920
and some of this stuff might change just a little when we actually create that theme.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.160
Boy we're going to do is let's say posted at.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:20.400
And then let's do some kind of time we'll just say 2:00 pm on say 0 3 29

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.380
2016 and then we're going to say bye Brad.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.230
OK.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.360
After that let's put on H.R..

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:50.360
OK and then let's put the actual image.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.890
So we'll just link this to images slash 1. j

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.020
k and we want this to animate.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.230
So we're going to give this class of W3 animate.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.430
Actually let me just check that real quick.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.150
I wanted it to come in from the right.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.360
So

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:26.420
yeah we want that old b w 3 enemy right.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.140
OK so that's the image.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.000
And then under that I won another row.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.380
So this will be W3 row

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:54.990
and then we'll have a column say W3 call and let's do all two cases where we're going to put the back

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.380
button

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.950
and then we'll have a 10 here.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.600
OK now in the two we're just going to have to do a b.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:18.870
Put a line break and then we're going to have a link that's going to go back to index each time out

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.530
.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.680
And we're going to give it a class to formatted as a button.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.230
So that will be W3 PTEN and let's say W3 red

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.350
.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.970
And then on this side we're going to have the photo title

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.580
and also the description K description.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.350
I'm just going to paste this little bit of sample text in.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.450
All right so we'll save that and we'll go back to single.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.460
And there we go we can see the image comes in from the right.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:12.300
Now a couple things I want to do this is to close right here you can see it's there up against each

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.810
other this column in this column.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.670
So we're going to do is we have an article with the class of post.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:26.550
So I'm just going to add some padding to that post class.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.230
So for that I will say padding 20 pixels.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.960
And then I also want to add the class of Pech to that main image.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.490
So right here we'll say pick.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.510
Save that and check it out.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.560
OK.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.570
So now you can see that the photo actually fits in there.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.750
And also we're not right up against the the side column.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.770
So we have the title of the description and the back.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.280
Awesome.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.990
So that's going to be it for the H team l now in the next video are ready to start creating our WordPress

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.320
theme
