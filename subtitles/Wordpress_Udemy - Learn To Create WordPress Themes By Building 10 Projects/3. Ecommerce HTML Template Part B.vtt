WEBVTT

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.620
All right so the aged female version or theme we have the it's all done but we need to do the same.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.730
SS All right.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.930
So let's go ahead and open up at dot CSS and if we take a look at the template we're going to start

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.120
with the core styles.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.300
Now you'll notice that by default the buttons and the links are blue.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.640
I actually want to change that to red.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.070
All right so we're going to do here is we're going to put in a tag in let's say color and it's going

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.270
to be a value of e c to see two f k which will give it that red color.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.570
All right so that's the length.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.850
Now we also want the buttons to have a background color of that

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.380
right.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.160
And I also want to give the buttons a little border at the bottom.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:17.460
So it's a border bottom two three pixels it's two triple three solid.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.470
OK.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.170
Now when I hover over it it turns blue.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.400
Same thing with the length.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.420
So we want to fix that so let's do a hover.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.550
I'm going to fix the color which will be triple three.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.870
And we also want to button

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.550
hover and that's going to be the background.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.130
All right.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.670
Check that.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.840
Hey that's good.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.400
So let's now take care of this menu.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.420
So that's in the header.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:15.690
So we're going to say had our dog in the main Nav. and let's float it to the right and let's to margin

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:25.460
top 30 pixels and let's set the font size a little bigger we'll do 18 pixels.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.910
All right.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.740
And then for the ally tags going to do those

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.000
.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.250
We just want to give up padding right twenty

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.750
reload and there we go.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.090
Let's also give a little margin to the header on the bottom

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.560
.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.960
OK.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.450
So next let's do the Showcase area.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:17.450
So that has a class of showcase and it also has a class of color.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:28.050
OK so first thing we want to text aligned to the center and let's add a padding of 30 pixels and also

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.250
a margin bottom of 20 pixels.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.010
All right.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.600
That looks better.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.760
Now for the products area

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.130
safe products

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.630
columns we're just going to add a margin bottom.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:13.520
Right and let's do product singular and for that we want to text a line to the center I would see so

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:23.950
for the button I want to add a little margin to the top so I'm going to save product bought and margin

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.080
chart and let's do 10 pixels.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.100
All right let's save that reload.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.080
That's starting to look good.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.930
Now for the menu on the right.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.200
I want to add a little bit of a border underneath each list item.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.620
So that has a class of vertical.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.170
So say vertical ally

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.210
for the bottom is to one pixel and will do.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.460
Triple C solid.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.730
Yeah.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.140
All right.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.260
Now I don't want the last one to have a border.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:16.620
So let's copy that and then we're just going to add on to this last child and we'll set this to none

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.520
.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:26.350
Ok that should get rid of the last border and I think we just about there let's do the Forder.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.930
OK or I'm going to give it to you.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:37.040
Background triple three you give it a color of white.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.350
And what else.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.020
Let's align things to the center

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.870
.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.140
Let's give a margin to the top

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.730
and also padding to the top.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.760
You do 20 pixels and I think that's it.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.270
So let's save it right.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.050
No it doesn't look right.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.020
Let's set a height

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.780
of 70.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.480
That's good.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.160
All right.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.040
So not too bad.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.530
Let's take a look at the details

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.660
.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.320
And that looks good about page looks good.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.370
Actually that shouldn't be censored.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.520
I think I have a class in there that I shouldn't see

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.160
.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:58.330
Yeah we have right here product let's take off product.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.770
And

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.080
here we go.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:13.680
All right so are h t m l template is done in the next video we're going to jump into Wordpress and we'll

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.350
start to create a WordPress theme based on this design
