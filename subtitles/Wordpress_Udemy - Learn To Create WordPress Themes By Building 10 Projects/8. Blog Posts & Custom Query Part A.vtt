WEBVTT

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.170
So we have all of our customize or functionality set up.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.090
Now we want to do is be able to display the blog posts.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.770
Ok so we want them on the home page and we also want a custom blog page.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.090
So first thing we'll do is go into the back end and we're going to go to pages.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.350
We're going to create a new page called home no content just the title.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.020
And then we also want another one called Blog.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.280
OK publish that and then we'll go to settings reading and we're going to select a static page for the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.810
home page which will be home post page will be Blog.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.220
All right.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.370
We also want to add that blog page to our menu so we're going to go to appearance menus and just bring

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.050
that over.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.700
All right.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.290
And we also want this custom length that we have for home are going to get rid of that and then we're

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.130
going to bring home over.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.720
All right so we'll save that go back reload.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770
OK we now have home.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.650
I also have blog.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.570
Now right now our index peach just has static HDMI.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.320
That's why we're seeing this.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.810
So what we want to do is we're going to create a new file and we're going to save this as front dash

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.500
page taught THP.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.050
All right.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.280
Now if we go to the front page and reload it's going to go blank because it's looking at this file.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:49.380
So what we'll do is copy what we have in index THP and bring that over to front page save it reload

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.800
.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.390
And now it's back.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.240
All right so the Showcase area is all set.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.570
We want to begin to look down here.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.190
All right so let's go to our front page ph file and go under the showcase where you see the section

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:14.340
a section B and what I'm going to do for now is just keep the first section A and get rid of Section

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.500
B and the second section.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.080
All right.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.550
And we're going to fetch our blog posts.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.940
Now this is going to be a little different than what we've seen before because what we want to do is

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.120
by default if we just put our regular while loop in there it's just going to display that static home

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.640
page that we created.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.800
And that's not what we want we want a a roll of the latest posts so what are we going to do is we're

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:54.660
going to create a variable and let's call its latest blog posts and we're going to send it to new.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.800
We're going to use W.P. underscore queery.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.750
And then we want to pass an array in there.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.720
All right.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:11.280
In this array we can have different options but the option that we want is we want to save posts per

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.700
page and we're going to set out to three.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.580
So no more than three posts are going to display.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.520
Now what we want to do is let's go underneath

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:37.710
and we're going to say if in the past in that latest blog posts have posts we're checking to see if

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.220
it has any posts.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.360
And then what we do is we're going to say while

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.100
the latest blog posts have posts

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:03.680
and then let's put a call in here and they'll say latest blog posts the post.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.060
Ok so you can see it's just like our regular WordPress loop except we're using this latest blog posts

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.630
which comes from this WP queery.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.170
All right.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.980
So we want

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:31.320
to go like that and then down here are going to say p p and while and we also want.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.130
And if

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.980
that's the why is this I never closed this

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.300
OK.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:05:01.490
So down here just to make sure that this is actually working let's just say ph P the title.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.860
All right.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.930
And we don't have any.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.720
I think we only have the default hello world post Yeah.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.270
So that's showing right here.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.560
All right.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.600
So what I'm going to do is just create some posts.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.310
All right so what's new.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.440
Now we're going to need to use an image.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.480
You can see down here we don't have that option for a featured image so let's go to functions ph p.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:35.100
We're going to go right inside this clean cut theme support function.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.550
And we're just going to say add D-Md. support

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.810
and post thumbnails.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.140
OK so now if we go back here reload now we have featured image.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:05.930
So let's click that and let's grab some files Let's see

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.030
should be on the desk.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.050
Clean cut HDMI all you guys will have these images in your images folder.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:24.050
But I'm going to upload these three right here of the smartphone and we're going to choose the first

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.110
one and say set featured image OK.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:37.110
I'm just going to paste sample text then you guys can you can use this or whatever you'd like.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.160
All right now I'm going to put a read more here.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:51.250
See this insert read more tag and put that right there and then paste in some other text.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:58.580
OK because we're going to be using excerpt but I want to be able to target where I want that read more

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.600
.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.700
So I'm going to just put it in there.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.420
All right.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.450
I would see a new car going to have a category here with say web design.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.630
We'll add a couple of categories actually

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.420
it's a mobile

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.750
development.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.150
All right.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.630
I only want to choose one though for now.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.840
OK so that looks good.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.780
Let's go ahead and publish that.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.780
I'm going to add another one.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.520
And you can use the same content.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.990
OK title

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:48.890
and let's go ahead and choose the image and choose the second one that looks good publish and let's

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.790
create one more ups

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.840
and paste that in feature image.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.530
We're going to choose this one and just publish.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.230
All right.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:17.150
So if you go to the front end now and reload you can see right here we're getting the different titles

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.760
.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.220
All right which is coming from

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.370
this right here the title.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.220
So what I want to do is get rid of that and then take this section A.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.080
Let's go ahead and cut that out and put that right in here

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.240
.

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:43.060
OK.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.370
Save that.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:46.820
All right.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:54.650
So now it's getting all of the post but we're getting the same title and content that's because it's

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.470
just static rate here.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:05.030
So what we could do is like the title or just get rid of that to save the title.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.570
And now the title should change.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.740
OK right here for the content.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.700
We can put in THP

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.300
the excerpt

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.500
that changes the content
