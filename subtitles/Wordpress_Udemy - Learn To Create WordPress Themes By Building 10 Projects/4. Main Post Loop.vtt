WEBVTT

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.140
All right.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.900
So we're going to start to work on displaying the posts in our theme.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.130
But the first thing we need to do is actually create some content so I'm in the back end now and I'm

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.680
on the category's page and I'm going to start to create some new categories.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.930
All right.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.590
So create one called business let's say entertainment

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.430
family

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.490
featured which is an important one because that's going to actually be part of our home page is going

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.050
to be the featured posts.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.400
So we want that.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.120
Let's add one called politics

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.250
technology

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.090
and lots to travel.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.280
OK.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.710
So now we want to go to posts now we want to be able to add an image to our posts.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.550
So before we do anything there let's go into functions of P we go into our W.P. news themes support

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.620
function.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:25.230
And we just want to say add themes support and then just pass and post dash thumbnails.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.140
OK so now go back and let's just delete the hello world.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.330
OK and then we're going to start to create some new posts or see new.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.160
And I'm just going to be pasting stuff in just sample content.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.880
You guys are free to just copy it or use your own text or whatever you like.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.130
All right now what we're going to do is we're going to paste in a couple of sentences and then I'm going

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.750
to hit the insert read more tag so that that controls where the content actually gets cut off.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.560
All right and then I'm just going to paste the rest in down here.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.980
All right.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.680
And as far as category I would say entertainment and family.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.510
OK.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:22.200
And then for tags we could just put whatever tag line tag to tag free and then down here we want the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.610
featured image.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:35.620
So if we say set featured image and we need to upload a bunch of stuff here let's see.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.230
OK so you should have a folder with all these images.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.730
I'm just going to grab them all

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.060
and then I'm just going to grab this guitar one here and then set featured image.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.620
OK so that looks good for the first post let's publish.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.110
OK now we'll go add another one

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:11.890
and then we'll get the intro text and then read more and then I'll paste in the rest of it.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.250
OK so this will be business.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:25.610
And then for the image let's grab this one here set featured image and publish.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.590
All right so I'm going to go through and do this probably seven or eight more times because we want

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.930
to have quite a bit of post to work with.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.880
All right so I'll do that.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.420
And then I'll be back.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.430
All right so I am back and I created a bunch of posts here.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.510
So now what we want to do is go to index ph P.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.270
Now the first area that we want to add is this.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.880
This part here this top part and this is going to be just the regular Word Press loop we're not going

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.350
to create a custom query or anything like that.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.540
Just every post that's created is going to show up here.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.280
All right so let's go to an index peach P We want to go under the form and this is that area.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:19.140
So we're going to wants first thing let's put a having parades here and H-2 and let's just call this

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.670
recent news.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.080
OK.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.410
And then where we want to put the loop is right below the you well k because these allies this represents

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.350
one 1 post and we want to loop through and output that.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.550
So we only need that first ally and then we can get rid of the rest here

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:49.210
.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.340
So this is going to shorten the template up quite a bit.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.800
OK so now this ally we need to wrap the Hawai a loop around it.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.530
So say p p while

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:12.180
it's a while have two posts and then we need to do this the post

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.940
and then down here we want to end it

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.280
right now and here is where we can put our dynamic content.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:36.560
So for instance the title we can replace that with PH P is the title.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.360
And just to make sure that it's working let's check it out.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.170
Look at these titles and then we reload.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.380
And now they have the actual post titles.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.160
So that's what we want.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.400
Now this here is Baby Doe.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.770
We actually want to put the date there.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.080
So let's fine that OK right here this age 5.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:05.900
So in here we're going to replace baby doll with p p the tight end.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.930
OK.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.880
Now we want to format this so I'm going to paste this in here.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.230
OK we'll take a look at that.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.740
And you can see we're getting the time at the date and time.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.680
So let's do the image right which is right here.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.300
Now notice this image Oh no it doesn't have a class.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.220
Oh yeah it does have bottom space.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.030
OK remember it has that class half bottom space.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:50.140
So we're going to go ahead and replace this and we're going to say ph P the posts thumbnail.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.190
OK now we're going to want this to be a custom size.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:04.260
So what we can do here is let's pass in a string called news thought OK and we can actually use this

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.340
in our functions file to make it a custom size before we do that.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:16.920
So let's add an array so we can add some options because we want to add a class option case to the club

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.180
.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:24.170
The class is going to be half bottom space.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.030
All right.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.790
And that should do it.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:37.640
Now if we go and check it you can see that the width is correct because it's bound by CSX but the height

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:44.510
is and so what we want to do is create a custom size for this news item so we can go and functions ph

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.910
and right under where we add support for thumbnails.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:59.820
We're going to say add image size and then we're going to pass an unused thumb and then the second parameter

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.500
will be the width which will be 400 and then the height which will be 200.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.210
So let's save that reload.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.120
And now our images of the correct height.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.050
So all of this is dynamic except for this right here.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:23.170
We need to put in the x or so place this paragraph in and actually create a div called X

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:35.120
and then and here we can just say ph P The X sir.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.570
OK we'll go and reload.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.990
And now we have our custom content showing up.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:50.980
All right and see notice that the navigation just automatically works.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:55.980
All right so in the next video we're going to move along and create our custom queries so that we can

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.500
get the featured popular and also the business post.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.840
All right so I'll see you in the next video
