WEBVTT

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.590
All right so in this video we're going to create a custom widget for our theme.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.640
So we have this Showcase area and I just want to create a widget that can take in a title and send text

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.410
and spit it out right here in this widget position.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.450
So if you look at this documentation page this is for the widget API.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.250
Basically what we need to do is create a class that extends W.P. widget and it's going to have a few

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.960
different methods that will have a constructor to call the constructor of the parent class and also

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.170
set up the title and description and then we have the widget method which will output the content of

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.070
the widget.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.750
We have the form method which will output the admin form and then we have the update which will take

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.410
care of updating any fields.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.870
Now we're going to do is we're going to go into the WP content folder and then plug ins and we're going

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:10.530
to create a new folder there and we're going to call it showcase dash what's called showcase dash widget

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.910
because although it is a plug in it's also a widget.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.820
So let's go ahead and create a new file here and this is going to be called same thing showcase widget

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.390
dot HP.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.900
And then one more file.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.890
This is going to be the class file.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.980
So we're going to save it as class Daut

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.280
showcase widget ph Ph.D..

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.190
All right.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.560
So the showcase widget dog page file is going to be the main file but the class is going to be where

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.500
we will do most of the most of the functionality.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.350
All right so what we want to do in this file is we want to open up a comment block ok and go like that

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.560
.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:15.660
And this right here we're going to say plug in a name which will be a showcase widget

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.310
and we're going to do description

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:33.150
simple Showcase area version 1.0.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.900
And let's do one more which will be the offer.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.860
OK.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.270
Now we want to include the class file

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.280
so say conclude and let's put in here.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.570
Class art showcase

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.820
widget ph p.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.300
And then we need to register the widget.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.810
So we want function

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.910
register showcase widget

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:35.250
and then we're going to call the register widget function and pass on to showcase underscore widget

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.670
.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.650
So this needs to be whatever your class name is.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.940
OK so that's what we'll name the class.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.420
And then we just need the ADD action.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:54.300
So actually we're going to say widgets in net and then we just want

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.360
register showcase widget and that's it for this file.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.490
So let's go into the class file now and I'm actually going to grab this from the documentation this

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.180
sample.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.490
Ok I'll paste that in.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.610
We need ph tags though.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.840
Now I don't want this to take forever.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.280
So we're going to be doing some copying and pasting.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.500
First of all I want to change the name of it from my widget to showcase widget and then let's take a

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.060
look at the constructor.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.590
So for now I'm going to just get rid of what's in there and then just paste my code in.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.140
So what we were doing here is we're calling the parent constructor the parent.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.570
Is this W.P. widget class OK.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.770
And then we're just putting in an idea of showcase widget.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.440
We have the name showcase widget and then we have a description down here.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.970
OK in a text domain which can be anything you like I just use text domain.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.610
All right so constructor's pretty simple.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.910
This widget method here.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.870
This will display the front end of the widget.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.230
So we basically need three things we need the title of the widget we need the heading which is this

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.430
here and then we need a field for the text which is that.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.760
So I want to just paste this in real quick.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.820
OK so we have our title.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:35.700
Now we're setting these to the instance K instance heading instance text that that represents what is

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.870
in the database for those values.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.850
All right.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.940
So we're going to stay in the same method and we'll pay some other stuff in.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.750
All right so the args we have before widget after widget.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.960
OK that's in case we want custom tags or whatever we want to go before and after.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.430
We also have them available for the title we have before title after title.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:08.030
So for instance if you wanted to use an H for the title you could do that or H-1 whatever you want.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:14.720
All right and then down here this actually shouldn't be form the sheet the display content.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.710
And I'm going to have a function called Get content.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.070
All right.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.270
We're passing in the heading in the text from up here.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.660
All right.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.470
And then of course we have the after widget.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.930
So before we move on to these let's create this get content

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.560
.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.090
And that takes in the heading and text

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.430
.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.210
Ok let's just paste this in.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.350
And this could have very well just went right here but I liked her.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.600
Kind of separated a little bit.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.210
So what we're doing is we have a variable called output.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:04.590
We're sending it to a template here with the H-1 the text and then we'll just have a button.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.500
OK and then we're just returning the output.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.890
All right.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.390
So that's actually B that's actually going here.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.930
We're calling it.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:19.740
All right so let's go down to the form this represents the back end form where we can actually put the

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.470
heading in the text and stuff like that.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.250
OK let me just paste this part in.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.590
So what we're doing is we're checking to see if there's a title if there is we're setting it the variable

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:37.770
to whatever is in the instance if there's not then we're just going to set it to showcase widget.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:44.920
All right and then we also need to get the heading and the text we're pulling that those from the instance

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:50.250
as well.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:57.060
Now for the actual back end form it's it's a lot of HTML sort I'm going to do is just and the page here

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:03.440
and then continue it right here and then we can put all the aged him out here.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.540
All right so I'm going to go ahead and paste this in.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.130
And it's quite a bit.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.640
You need to pause it.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.680
That's fine.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:16.410
But basically we have a couple of paragraphs and they contain a label for each field and then the input

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:24.120
case you can see for the label we have we can echo out this get field ID.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.480
And what we want is the title.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.390
All right.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:35.400
And then for the input we have an ID same thing get field ID and then the name of the field which is

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:44.070
title and then right here for the name we have get field name title and then for the value we're using

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.680
the title variable.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:50.760
All right we're just escaping it with escape attribute escape after all right.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.970
We're doing the same thing here for the heading and then the same thing for the text.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:09:00.110
Ok so it's really quite simple even though it looks like a lot of code.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.900
So next you want to go to the update method.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.260
This is where when we add a heading and text in the back end and we click save.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.740
This is what saves it.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:18.740
All right so we just grab some code here are then.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:26.580
So we have an instance which equals an block an empty array and then we're saying instance title equals

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.580
whatever is in the new instance k whatever is saved as the title.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.840
Same thing with the heading we're setting it to the new instance heading.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.940
And same with the text and then we're just returning that instance.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:45.550
OK so this will update whatever we put in for the fields in the back and widget form.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.140
All right so let's go ahead and save that and what we'll do.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:58.610
Now make sure both files are saved or go in the back end here and let's reload and then go to plug ins

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:07.180
and you can see right here we have the showcase widget as a description the version the name.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.670
And we're going to click activate.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:10.770
OK.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:15.060
So we click activate and then if we go to appearance

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:24.180
it's whole week oh you know what we didn't set up a widget position yet.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:32.250
So let's go into functions Dopp ph P and our themes folder and we're going to set up our widget locations

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:32.400
.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.650
So I'm going to go down to the bottom of the file and paste this in.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:36.920
All right.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:43.800
So what we're doing here is we have a function called M-S widgets and we have two places where we want

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.250
widgets.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:50.340
One is on the side bar and one is in the showcase for the widget we just created.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:50.730
All right.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:59.720
And we have in our Sidebar we want the div class call out to wrap around the whole widget and then the

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:07.050
title we want to be in H3 right down here we're calling our action on widgets and net and then we're

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:12.470
just inputting the name of our function M-S in widgets.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:20.070
All right so let's save that and go back to the back end and reload and now under appearance we can

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:26.120
now see widgets we click that and see we have the sidebar and the showcase available.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:32.490
And if we go down here you can see our showcase widget which is the plugin we just created.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.960
So let's go ahead and add that to the showcase area.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.280
All right.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:45.150
So we have our title on we're going to do is get rid of the title and for the heading we'll say discount

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:49.450
clothing.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:55.760
And for the text I'm just going to copy what we have here.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.170
OK save that.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:04.230
Go back to actually the front ends not going to change yet because we didn't implement it in the template

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.560
but you can see that the content has saved.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:16.740
So what we need to do now is go into our index P2P file and go down to where we have this showcase area

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.490
.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:22.920
And before we actually show it we want to check to make sure that it's enabled so we're going to save

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:34.650
ph P if and we can use is active sidebar which we've used in past projects and the widget position is

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.120
going to be showcase

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.010
down here will do in END-IF

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.180
.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:55.140
And now we want to do is replace the H-1 paragraph and Button and we want to get rid of that and then

00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:01.530
we're going to save ph P dynamic underscore side bar

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.530
and pass in the name of the position which is showcase.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:14.940
Save that let's go check out the front end and we get discount clothing.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:21.270
So just to make sure that it's actually reading our widget Let's go and change this to discount clothings

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:30.180
and save go to the front end reload and we get discount clothings So we know that this is coming from

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.470
our custom Plug-In.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.780
All right.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:40.800
And we created a plug in that is not only not only able to use it on this theme you can use it anywhere

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.430
.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.460
All right.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:49.770
So in the next video we're going to take care of the sidebar widgets we want this categories to actually

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.170
come from WordPress categories.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.120
All right so we will get into that next
