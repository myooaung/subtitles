WEBVTT

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.390
All right so before we get into coding the Wordpress theme we're going to first just create the H team

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.120
template.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.860
OK just using H TMLC SS and this is a bootstrap theme.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.700
And actually going to take one of the example templates and start from that.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.300
OK so if you go to get bootstrapped dot com and go to getting started and we scroll down actually you

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.960
can click over on examples where we're going to start with this narrow Jumbotron template.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.930
So it's quick on that.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.700
And what we'll do is do a control you so we can see the source code.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.570
And let's go ahead and create our template folder.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.850
OK so I'm just going to call this business actual call it business.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.590
Each team.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.730
All right.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.900
And let's open that up.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.620
And before we actually copy that let's go ahead and download bootstrap

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:16.980
and I will open that up and then we're going to take C Ss actually we'll create our own CSSA folder

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.490
and all we need from here is bootstrap Dotsie ss.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:34.760
We're also going to have a J.S. folder and then we'll bring over bootstrap J.S. cash.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.870
That's all we need from this package.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.540
Now what we'll do is create an index page

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.210
and open that up and what we'll do is grab all of that source code.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.070
They will just grab the entire thing and paste that in.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.090
Now we're going to go through and just remove what we don't need and make a lot more simple than this

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.710
.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.390
Let's get rid of these comments.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:19.080
We don't need these metal tags right here for the title just for now I'm going to change it to just

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.320
business theme.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.280
OK now we need to point to our bootstraps DSS.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:34.030
So we're going to just remove that and we're using the non magnified file so just bootstrapped CSX.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.220
And then the rest of the stuff in the head we can actually just get rid of.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.780
All right.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:48.000
Now we're going to have a custom stylesheet So let's copy this and we'll just change this two style

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.640
dots here.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.890
Yes.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.000
You know we might as well create that now.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.910
So this will be style dot CSS

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.400
limbers will open that up as well.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.100
Now in the body.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.190
Actually before you get to that let's go ahead and download font.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.710
Awesome.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.290
OK so if we click download

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.230
and we open that up what we want from here is the CSSA file so we want that.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.620
Let's bring that over to our project

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.290
and we're also going to take the fonts folder.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.190
OK bring that right over in and that's it.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.010
So we want to also point to that file.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.370
So let's go ahead and copy that.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.270
And let's just change this to font.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.610
Awesome dot CSS

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.140
moving down into the body.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.720
We have our NAV bar here OK for home.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.630
Let's change that to indexed on HDMI now.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:28.280
This one here will be about dot HTML and then this one this contact I'm going to change to blog.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.420
OK.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:36.150
Project Name now we're actually going to use a logo a really simple logo that I created.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.330
So I'm going to just change that to image source.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.490
Let's say I'm Jiyu of a folder called IMT and then logo dot P and G.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.380
OK so let's go at that.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.260
You should have it in your project files.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.190
So I'm going to create a new folder here called the I Am G

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.410
and I'm going to just paste this in.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.520
So now move on to the Jumbotron.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.680
Now this we can just keep that as it is right now.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.130
All right.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.260
Going down we have this we have another row with the class of marketing that just adds some extra padding

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.430
before we do anything else let's just go ahead and save this.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.370
Now if we go and look at it

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.920
OK.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:47.130
So it doesn't look like the example which is or it's this right here.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.230
And the reason for that is this has a custom CSSA file.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.940
If you look at the source code there's a file called Jumbotron narrow CSSA.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.780
We want to click on that and then we just want to copy everything that's in there and go and paste that

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.680
in our style dot CSSA file.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.420
OK now if we save that and go back

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.360
now it looks just like the demo.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.160
All right.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.180
Now that's style CSSA file actually has a lot of code that we don't need.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.860
So I really want to just clean this up.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:29.460
We don't need all the comments for one thing.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.550
I mean you can keep them if you like I just don't like to make it as clean and simple as possible.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.640
You don't really need these comments.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.830
We can actually get rid of these media these these styles here

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:04.260
and since we don't even need this sort of thing from this media tag down we get rid of me and say I

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.820
don't think we need this hurried here either.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.410
All right.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.480
Let's save that and see what we get.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.820
OK.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.960
So we need to just make that narrow.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.030
Let's create a container.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.770
OK there's a class called container and we're just going to settle with two that actually will set a

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:35.500
max with this this template will be completely responsive as well.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.720
So going to the max with 10 20 pixels.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.620
There we go.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:43.090
OK.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.890
I don't want it narrow like like the demo.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.720
So that looks good.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.340
Now this this area here isn't going to be here.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.720
What I want to go here is those three boxes.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.790
All right which will have an icon a heading and a paragraph right which we have right here a heading

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:03.890
in a paragraph.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.630
So what we'll do is go into index each time out.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:14.100
And where we have this row right here remarketing And then what we what we have is two six column divs

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.470
.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:26.720
What we want is three four column divs So let's go ahead and just get rid of those in the house and

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.480
let's change this to four.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.030
Change that to four and then we just need one more of these.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.810
OK.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:45.170
I also want to change the age 4 to age 3.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:48.840
OK.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:55.920
And this row here all the rows I'm going to use a section tag instead of a div just to help organize

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.170
a little better.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:00.660
All right.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.720
Now we're also going to need our icons.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:10.730
So if you've ever used font awesome you know that we use an eye tag and then we need the FAA classes

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.210
so F.A..

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.460
And then to get the actual icon you need that icons class.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.280
In this case it's F.A. bar chart.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.640
And then we want it to be a little bigger so we're going to add F.E. 3.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.110
And then just end the tag.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.080
All right so let's copy that.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:36.590
This one here we're going to change from bar chart to code F-8 code.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:42.930
And then this one here we're going to change it to F.A. desktop

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.450
save and take a look.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:57.330
OK so for some reason the FAA 3 class it's supposed to make it bigger but for some reason the number

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.260
the FAA dash and then the size they don't work by default.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.520
So we're just going to have to add in our own class to make those better.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:05.820
All right.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.730
We'll get to that in a little bit.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:08.190
OK.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.590
Just want to finish the HVM out.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:17.940
So the next area is going to be that that big green area with the heading and the paragraph.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:25.430
So let's go right below this section and then we're going to open another section.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.230
This is going to have a class of row.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:35.170
And we're also going to call this content region wide.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:40.560
All right and this is actually going to be a widget position when we when we build the theme we're also

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.100
going to want some padding so we can create some padding classes.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.040
This is going to be P-T 50.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.980
So padding top 50 and then padding bottom 40

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:59.510
right now in here are going to create or we're going to add a container class

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:14.310
and then rewards or call them class which will be our call M.D 12 because we want to go across the whole

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.200
screen and then we can put our H-1.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:30.440
So say clean strap WordPress theme and then for the paragraph I'm just going to grab that and paste

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.960
it in.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:35.110
All right.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.650
And he noticed that I gave it the class of lead.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.840
This is a bootstrap class that will just make it bigger.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:46.340
OK let's do some indentation here.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:50.130
OK.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.260
Save that.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.590
If we reload.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.970
It doesn't look very good.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.820
OK but that's the age him.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.010
We'll get to the CSSA in a little bit.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.930
So we're going to need the next widget area.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:07.770
I'm actually going to just copy this and we're going to change this to continent region 2.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:16.240
And this is going to have pairing top 40 and padding bottom 40 right in there instead of having one

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.300
12 column div.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.970
We're going to have to we're going to have one that is 5.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:32.640
OK so an image is going to go there and then we'll have another column with seven and that will be where

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.550
we put the list.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.850
OK so here let's put an image tag.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:47.370
And we're going to say source equals I am g slash.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.260
Pick one dot peg.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:51.120
All right.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:55.560
And all of these images will be in your project files on this side.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.780
We're going to have an unordered list.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:09.660
So let's put a heading here we'll just say theme features and then I'm going to just paste in well with

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:14.270
the class of list group and then each ally will have a class of list group.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.470
Item.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.080
All right.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:22.310
And also I put an icon a Czech icon next to each one.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.450
So let's save that and actually need to put the image in that in the correct folder.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:35.190
So it's true that I'm actually going to paste in all the images you should have these in a folder called

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.200
underscore images.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:37.490
All right.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.790
And then just pick one right.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.330
Here is the one that you are putting there.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.890
So let's go ahead and reload.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.570
OK.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.010
So now we have the pick and then we have the list.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.400
Now it's big because we didn't set a with to it.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:55.700
We're going to want to set it to with 100 percent but we'll get to that in a little bit.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:03.080
So after that section we have the footer and the footer just like with the boxes will have three four

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.390
column divs.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:12.050
So I'm actually going to copy what we have in here and put that in the footer.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:12.750
All right.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.650
And then we'll just clear out each each for column div

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:25.910
K so each one will have an H for heading.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:34.830
So I'm just going to say heading and let's put in a paragraph actually before we do that let's add a

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.300
container div here

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:48.270
because we want it to all be pushed towards the middle.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.220
All right.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:57.750
So I'm going to just paste in a paragraph here and then for the next one is going to be just a heading

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:06.780
and then an unordered list and then the last one is going to be a heading and of simple form.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.090
OK so has a name email and a message field.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:21.040
So let's save that and go and reload and then we get our 3 footer for widget areas.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.290
All right so that's the H M L for the index page.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:33.450
No it doesn't look too good yet but we will fix that in the next parts of this lecture we're going to

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.150
create the other pages so we're going to have an inner page for about.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:41.190
And then the blog page and then the single blog page.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.990
All right so we'll get to that next.
