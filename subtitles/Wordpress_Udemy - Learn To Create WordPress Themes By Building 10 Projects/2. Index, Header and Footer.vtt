WEBVTT

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.950
All right so let's go ahead and get started on our bootstrap theme for wordpress.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.540
What I have here is just a default installation of Wordpress I haven't touched anything I haven't created

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.000
any posts or anything like that.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.780
All right so are starting from scratch here I have the Sublime Text and in the sidebar I have my Word

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.380
Press installation and you can see in the themes folder we have just the default themes.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.460
So what I'm going to do now is going to create a new folder in the themes folder and we're going to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.210
call this template word strap.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.600
OK first thing we're going to create is the style dot CSSA file.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.930
Whoops don't want to do that.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.190
And this also acts kind of like a manifest file.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.840
You need to put in our comments up here.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.170
All right.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.810
So let's go ahead and add a theme name

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:12.800
and we want to call this word strap and see we don't need that.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:24.510
Next thing we the author put my name in you can put your own name and it's too off or you or I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:37.290
will just say you want to start com what else description.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:47.660
I'll say simple to strap theme for word press.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.590
OK let's do version this'll be version 1.0.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.200
And I think that should be good.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.180
All right so let's save that and then let's create an index file

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.100
.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.680
All right.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.160
Now it should be able to show under themes.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.600
Now go to parents and then.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.990
You can see we have this word strap.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.930
Now I do have a screen shot file so I'm going to paste that in the theme folder.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.360
OK you can find this in your project files.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.460
Very simple.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.870
Let's go ahead and reload.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.330
OK.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.070
Very simple.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.130
We just have the word word strap.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.340
OK it looks it looks all right.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:53.550
So what we want to do now let's go into index ph P and put some base HTL tags in here.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.410
So for the title there's a word strap.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.890
We're going to need boot straps.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.180
Let's go ahead and get that for you go to get bootstrapped dot com and we'll go ahead and download it

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.480
.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.500
They will open up the zip file.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.410
And let's also open up our theme folder and what we want to do here

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.590
is we want to create a CSSA folder.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.030
And we're going to bring bootstrap got CSSA over.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.460
All right.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:45.970
And then we'll also create a JSE folder and we're going to bring over bootstrap.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.460
Yes.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.710
OK.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.860
So close that up.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.820
Now let's go back into index ph P and we're going to have to include a couple link tags so let's say

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:11.840
link Raul Kikuyus style sheet and let's see href.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.370
Now we want to go in the CSSA folder and then

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.500
bootstrap Dart's the access.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.830
Right.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.620
We also want to make sure we include the main style sheet.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.860
Now to do that to strike gives us a function we can use.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.210
OK so say style sheet.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.360
And then.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:50.730
OK this is where we can use we can put in some ph p tags and we're going to say blog info in here we

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.960
just want to put in a style sheet underscore you Arel.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.530
All right.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.440
And then I'll bring all the system style sheets.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.090
All right.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:12.580
Now what I want to do is grab a nav bar so on the bootstrap Web site let's go to.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.130
Where is it components in the nav bar.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.810
And say let's grab this or we're going to take the whole thing here copy and let's put that in the body

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.550
.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.150
Save it and let's see what we have.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.010
OK we'll go to our front end.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.770
Oh I didn't.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.500
And inactivate So it's going to be the theme.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.040
All right.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.140
Now the reason that it looks like this is because it's not seeing the bootstrap CSSA file.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.720
All right if we look at the source code you can see it's just looking in slashy SS bootstrap but this

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.070
file is actually in the theme folder.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.470
So what we need to do is go back to index P2P And let's go up here.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:17.320
Get rid of that dot and we're going to say ph P the log info and in here we want to pass in template

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.850
underscore directory.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.100
OK.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.700
And then we'll add that each tag.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:31.560
And that's going to go inside of our template directory and then in CSSA so save that go back.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.320
And now it's working ok so we want to change this now bar a little bit.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.100
Let's go down to the nav tag here.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.270
And I just want to indent this

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.550
.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.560
All right.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.330
Now we're going to dumb this down quite a bit.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.250
So starting at the top.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.290
First thing we're going to do is get rid of the fluid.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.740
I want this to just be container.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.840
OK we'll get rid of the comments.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.170
We don't need that.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.620
And then we have this now our head our class.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.020
Let's see this button.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.580
This is for responsiveness.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:19.510
So when it's on a mobile or just a smaller screen in general will have a button that we can click that

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.020
will then show the menu.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.390
So we're going to leave all that stuff for the brand.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.780
Let's change that.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.500
Let's change that to word Strout.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.490
It's actually you know what let's not do words.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:45.460
Let's make this dynamic we want it to reflect whatever we have as the site name and in wordpress.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:56.740
All right so let's see we're going to do each p blog info and then and here we just want to pass in

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.540
the name right.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:10.440
And for the draft for the length let's say ph P blog info.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.160
Here we want to put in you are l

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:26.640
right now this down here is where we're going to implement the W.P. Now Walker class.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.040
So what are you going to do is just get rid of this whole UL

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:43.150
age just like that and then we have our form this is going to be the search form and it's going to be

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:48.240
pretty much completely redone so I'm going to take out everything that's in the form tags

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.420
which ends right here.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:01.310
All right so we get that and then we're going to take out this whole you will as well.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.520
All right so we're left with just this.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:04.840
OK.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.280
So this is the the entire Nav..

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.650
So we'll hold off just for now with that let's see what that looks like.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.100
OK so it's very basic.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.650
We just have our branding.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:24.550
We'll do the will implement the walk or nav or the nav Walker in the next video.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:30.930
But let's just continue on with some of the base some of the basic CML.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:36.750
Next thing we're going to do is we're going to go under where the nav ends and we're going to create

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:49.890
the div and let's give it a class of container and also index.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.480
All right.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.520
And then here we're going to have a row.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.910
OK we're going to use bootstraps grid system

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:04.300
so we have a row and inside there we're going to have a column

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.330
say call Amedee 8.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.260
So that'll be in a column div..

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:21.960
And we're also going to have a 4 column divs going to copy that.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.760
And we're just going to change that to a 4.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.640
This will be the side bar.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:31.480
So inside the 8 column div we're going to have a panel.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:39.540
So say class equals panel and souls sake panel default

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.710
pay and then inside that we're going to have the panel heading

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:09.060
right in the panel heading we'll have an H three we'll give it a class of panel title

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.580
and for the text we're going to say blog posts.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.630
I'm not sure why this isn't indenting automatically It used to.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.430
OK so that's our panel title.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.950
Now we want to go under the heading div and then put the body.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:39.290
So we want div class and the panel body.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.980
So in here is where we're going to have our post loop.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.340
So it's a PH p.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.060
If we're going to do if have hosts

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.990
if have posts use the shorthand syntax

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.770
and then we're going to put in a while.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.320
So say while

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.350
have hosts

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:27.380
we're going to go like that and say the underscore host

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.620
.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.250
Let's do our and while

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:46.170
now we're going to have two columns here we're going to have one for the image and then one for all

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.380
the data.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:47.690
All right.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:58.230
So let's put in a class called row and then we're going to do div class.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.860
So we call and the three

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.630
will just say image here

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.760
and then we'll have our nine columns.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:20.190
So we call em the nine.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.770
And in here it was put in the title say ph.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.220
He actually put this in an H to

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.350
THP echo the underscore title

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.000
save that.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:50.370
OK so here you can see we have our three column div where the image will go.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.300
And then our 9 column with the content.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.090
So we'll get back to adding all the content there in a little bit.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.100
But let's continue on and add the side bar code here.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:03.970
OK.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.920
Now this is going to be a widget area.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:15.270
So what we need to do is create a function that BHP file and we need to register the widgets we want

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.110
which will be just the sidebar.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:24.210
So right here what we'll do is let's say ph P and then we're going to see if there is actually a widget

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.470
active here.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:38.940
So if it is under score active underscore sidebar and then we need the actual digit position which will

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.900
be side bar

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.750
.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:57.890
And then here what we'll do is say H-P dynamic underscore side bar OK.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:06.930
We also need the position which will be side bar OK it doesn't have to be called so I can call it whatever

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.370
you like.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:14.760
All right so save that and let's add the footer real quick.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:22.500
OK so underneath we want to go under the row actually actually I want to go under the whole container

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.700
.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:25.310
All right.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.810
And what we want to do is we want to create another container

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:38.460
.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:38.800
All right.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:45.010
And let's put the horizontal rule here and then we want our footer tags

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.670
.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:57.360
Inside the footer will have a paragraph and let's to a copyright

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:04.130
.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.560
All right.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:13.160
Now I also want to include two things we want.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.060
Jay Querrey and we want the bootstrap javascript file.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:18.380
OK.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:25.780
We're going to put our javascript's right here and actually get a piece and paste in the J.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.870
Querrey which is just going to be the CD and

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.890
also paste in the bootstrap J as.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:40.370
Now we're using this blog info template directory just like we did with the CSSA file.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:46.260
All right so let's save that and reload and they use the wrong symbol for the copyright.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.770
They should actually be an ampersand.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.230
All right.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:17:00.980
So I think before we end this part what I want to do is split this up into a header in a folder file

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.040
.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:10.920
In addition to index pupae so in index P We're going to grab from the very top down to the end of the

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.920
nav so right here.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:19.940
OK we're going to cut that and let's create a new file called hetter dot ph P tops.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:33.480
I keep doing that hetter dot ph P piece that n save it and then it's place inside index ph P We're going

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:40.310
to open up a set of p p tags and we're going to say get the score higher.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.490
All right so that should look the exact same which it does.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.080
And then we're going to do the same thing with Forder.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:56.220
We're going to grab from this container down to the very bottom or cut that out and create a footer

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.820
file

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:07.310
and paste it and save it and then an index ph p.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.650
We just want to say get underscore for k.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.750
Now that should look the exact same good.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:26.430
So that clean thing things up a little bit in the next video we will work on the post-K this post roll

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.740
right here.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.490
Make that look a little better.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.960
We're going to include the meditator and all that.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.990
All right so I will see you in the next video
