00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:07.040
You guys in this video we're going to be working on the category's widget here on the left.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.730
Right now it's just a static.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.800
HTML on the wanted list.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.820
So what we want to do is in the back and if we go to actually you know what we haven't even enabled

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.840
widgets yet so we have to do that first in order to use widgets.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:30.150
We have to include the the initialization code in our functions not P2P files so let's go to functions

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:39.080
P2P and we're going to go down to the bottom here and let's see we have to specify the locations.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:52.100
So I will say widget locations and then function we'll call it in knit widgets and that's going to take

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.720
an ID and then what we want to do is say register or sidebar.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.930
Now this is a WordPress function that you want to you want to use when you're creating any kind of widget

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.430
position even though it's said sidebar it doesn't have to be in the sidebar.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.790
In our case it is but it doesn't have to be.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.130
All right so what we want to do in here is put in an array.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:30.030
So we have to give it a name which will be a bar and an ID

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.130
which will be side bar lower case.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.430
Right.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.370
And then we're going to add action.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.400
OK.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.840
The hook we want is

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.690
widgets in that case.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.290
And then of course we want to put in the function we just created which is that widgets.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:11.400
All right now we still have to register them so we're going to say register widgets we're only going

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.880
to have just the side sidebar in this particular template.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.230
So we want function that's a custom

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.030
register widgets

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.210
and we want to call register widget

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.530
.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.030
OK.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.310
So what we're doing here is we're going to use the categories widget but we're going to we're going

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.770
to take it in and create a custom version of it and put it in our temple in our theme folder.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:59.160
All right so in here will say W.P. underscore and widget underscore categories score custom line and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.010
then we need to add action.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:13.680
Same thing is going to be widgets and that's when we want this to run.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.180
And then we want this in here.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.290
So let's save that.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.190
Now we need to do is in our photogenic theme foliar we're going to create a folder called Widgets.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.460
Okay.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:42.160
And then inside there we're going to create a new file and we're going to save this as class dash W.P.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.290
dash widget

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.520
dash categories and Dot ph P.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.670
OK.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:01.950
And now we're going to do is we're going to go into the core widgets folder which is in the W.P. includes

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:02.790
folder.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.070
OK and then there's the widgets folder we're going to open that and then we want the categories widget

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.120
right here.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.400
And what I'm going to do is just copy everything in it and then paste it into the file that we created

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.940
.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.890
OK.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.850
Now we do want to change the class name remember in our functions file we called it this right here

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.900
.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.350
WP widgets categories custom.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.780
So that's what we want to hear.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.350
All right.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.860
We're going to save that now in order to use this we have to include this file in our functions file

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.880
.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.400
So let's go to the top here.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.050
And the reason that I'm doing this I probably should have told you before is because I knew I want to

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.660
be able to style it this way.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.020
All right.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.540
Because if we don't if we don't edit this file and add the correct class it's not going to look like

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.560
this.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.190
OK.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.080
Actually you know what let's go ahead and just.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.490
Well let me do this first.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.870
So in functions we want to say require of wants

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:21.580
and I will say widgets slash class dasht WP

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.150
widget categories dot ph P.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.480
OK so let's save that and then let's go into our admin area and now you should be able to go to parents

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.140
and then you should see a widgets item okaying and see we have our Sidebar.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.080
So we're going to bring categories over

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.040
and click save.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.960
And then let's go to our front end.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.960
Oh we didn't we didn't put the placeholder in there yet.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:02.380
So we need to go into our dog pee pee and where we have this unordered list right here we're going to

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.670
actually just get rid of that.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.160
And I'm just going to paste this in.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.160
OK so this is how we can add a widget to our code.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:18.670
First thing we're doing is checking for what we're saying is active sidebar the name sidebar.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.400
If it is then we're going to go ahead and call dynamic sidebar and we want the sidebar position.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.970
OK this could actually be anything you want it to be but in our case we named it sidebars.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.460
Let's save that and it's going reload.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.660
And there we go there's the categories widget.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.580
All right if I click on it on one of these it's going to work OK.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:47.060
So it's showing us the images images that are in that particular category.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.460
OK.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.180
So you can see that the appearance of it did change.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.050
That's why we need to put it in our own file here to edit because you never want to edit any of the

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.460
core widget files.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.510
So just to make sure that this is the that it's actually reading it from this file.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.700
Let's go ahead and change something actually you we're going to do is get rid of the title.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.790
I don't want to have the title.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.560
So right here I'm going to just comment this out.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.590
All right we'll save that reload and I can see that the title is gone.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.350
Next thing we want to do is add our class.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:33.870
So we need to find where the UL starts which is right here and what we want to do is just add class

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:42.620
equals W3 to dash you well right now I'll save that and go and reload.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.070
And now it looks like it did before and it works.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.590
All right.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:53.180
And the last thing I want to do is I want a link at the top here that says all photos so we can go back

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.230
to just seeing all of the photos.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:05.150
So we're going to go actually we're going to go right under that well and let's put an ally.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:15.280
OK so this is going to go to slash and then whatever whatever your folders called where NWP themes

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.670
Let's see.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.080
And then here we're going to say all photos

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.420
reload and now we have an all photos link and we can now go back.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:40.570
Now one other thing I want to do is take care of this top this margined right here another reason that

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.850
it's like this is because it's making room for the admin bar which isn't showing in order for that to

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:53.590
show we actually have to call W.P. Forder inside of our FOTR files so let's go there and we're just

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.860
going to say THP W.P. underscore Forder.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.390
OK we'll save that.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:05.250
Reload and now you can see we have our Agyeman bar.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.410
And of course this only shows two people that are logged in as an admin.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.250
Now the very last thing I want to do is make this search part functional.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:20.870
OK right now if we put something in here and I press Enter it's not doing anything.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.690
So we know that that's in the header file so let's go there.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.500
And right now we just have just a simple input.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.530
We actually need to turn this into a form so we're going to put form tags around it

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.890
.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:55.520
We're going to put in a method which is just going to be get a method get and then we need to have an

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.230
action

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:06.310
in the action and we're going to put in some ph p tags and we want to echo.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:18.520
I'm going to say escape you RL and then side there we're going to use the whole New R L function.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.950
And here we just want to pass a parameter of slash

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.600
and that should do it.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.800
One last thing we should give this input give it a name of apps

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.250
for search.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:36.570
OK.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:45.790
So we'll save that 3 load and in here let's say photo to enter and you can see it's giving us photo

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.600
to see photo 3.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.770
And if we just put it in photo it's going to give us all of them.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:55.150
All right.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.920
Well actually one of them isn't.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.530
I thought we had six.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.700
Which ones are we missing.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.530
I must not have named it correctly or it's set to only give us 5.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.200
Oh OK so one of them might put post four.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.280
OK so I'm just going to change that back to Frodo.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.220
OK.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.970
So that's the search widget.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.790
And that's the category widget.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.450
OK the last thing we need to do is the single page.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.070
OK so we'll get to that in the next video.
