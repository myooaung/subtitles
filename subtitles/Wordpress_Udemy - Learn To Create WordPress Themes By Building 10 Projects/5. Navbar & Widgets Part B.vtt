WEBVTT

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.950
Let's save and let's see if those render.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.770
All right good.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.920
So now we have our categories and you can see that now we have the panel around it as well.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.310
All right.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.790
Let's also bring over recent posts

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.180
.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.810
Change that to three.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.070
And also let's bring over recent comments

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.970
.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.680
All right so let's take a look and there they are.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:53.820
Now we have an issue because I want these to show up as list groups which are formatted better than

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.320
this.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.210
They take away the bullet add some padding add some borders.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.830
So what we need to do is kind of create our own version of these widgets inside of our theme folder

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.150
.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.680
OK so what we'll do is inside the theme folder we'll create another folder called widgets

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:23.880
and I'm actually going to go to my folder from within my file manager.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.650
All right.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.080
And then what I'm going to want to do is if we go to W.P. admin.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.770
Actually no the rupee includes and then widgets.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.810
You'll see all of the core widget files here.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.350
All right.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.230
So we want to grab the categories.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.110
The recent comments and the recent posts we're going to copy.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.000
Make sure you don't cut.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.480
Make sure you copy them and we're going to bring them over to our theme folder

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.370
and then widgets.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.130
OK we'll paste those in.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.010
And let's start with the categories 1.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.190
So it's open that up through sublime.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.820
All right.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.870
And what we first thing we want to do is the class name we need to change that.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.880
So what I'll do is put out an underscore and then custom.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.400
OK.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.680
And then what I want to change is the class names for the UL and the allies.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.340
OK I just want to add the bootstrap classes.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.870
So we want to go to right here where we have the UL and we're going to add class

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.680
list group.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.870
Now we also want the list items to have the class of list group item.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.380
But the way that this is set up we can access the list item tags from within here.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.990
So we need to do a little bit of customization in the functions p p files.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:05.100
So let's open that up and what we're going to do is we're going to go underneath when we go to the very

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:14.000
bottom and we're going to create Actually let's add a comment here first I'll say adds

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.620
the list group.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.190
Item

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.490
two categories.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.580
Just so we know what it does.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.900
So function

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.500
call it add new class list

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.760
categories.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.240
And then we pass in a variable

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.890
and say a list is going to equal string replace

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:10.380
or say cat item K that's the original class name we want to change that.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.850
Now we still want to have the cat item class because it needs that but we also want to add on the list

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.520
group item class.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.340
All right.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.220
And then we just need to return a list.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.550
OK so we want to do instead of adding an action here.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.140
We want to add filter.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.550
OK.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.590
Basically the action is used when you want to add something a filter is when you want to change something

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.760
.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.090
Right.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:57.270
So when I say add filter W.P. underscore a list of categories and then we just want the name of our

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.550
function.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.150
OK.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.430
So we're not out of the woods yet with these widgets.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.940
We have to we have to register them.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.490
So before we do that we need to include them up here all require.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.240
So we're going to say require Once

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.710
it's going to be the widgets folder that's in our theme folder and then we just need to include each

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.960
one so class W.P.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:39.980
widgets where we get categories dot ph P.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.700
OK we might as well include all of them.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.440
OK so we at the recent posts

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.380
and we have recent comments

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.570
.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:07.590
OK now we need to register just down the bottom here.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.300
It's a function

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.570
words strapped to register widgets

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.530
.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:35.820
And what we want here is the class names so W.P. underscore just

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.840
recent posts and custom

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.050
.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.520
This one will be recent comments

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.320
and then we'll do our categories

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:10.410
.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.740
Right now we need another add action.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.900
And this is going to be again on widgets in it

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.880
and then we just need the name of the function

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.920
.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:38.300
All right so let's save that in and go and reload cannot declare class recent posts.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.810
Oh did I not add that.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.760
Oh I didn't I didn't change this.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.400
So these should have customers well

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.380
OK.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:00.490
So we have all of our widgets registered in categories.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.990
Now has the list item class so that looks good.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:11.790
We also want to add these classes to these two as well so that instead of the bullet points we have

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.350
it looking like this.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:23.250
So let's go to our recent posts with you and we want to go down.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.730
We want to find the UL tag that we need to change which is right here.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:42.740
OK so we're just going to add a class of list group and then the ally will have a class of list group

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.260
item

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.660
case load that looks good.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.650
Now let's go to the recent comments

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.170
.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.250
And where is it

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.710
right here so we're going to add a class

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:15.400
of list group and then the ally will have a class

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:25.730
of group item save reload and there we go.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:32.320
So now we have some custom widgets OK and obviously you can do whatever you like you could make these

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:38.680
look totally different if you wanted to and it would only affect these widgets when your theme is loaded

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:38.700
.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.640
Casey you're not editing any core WordPress code.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.090
That would be bad.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.520
OK.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.090
Don't want to do that.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.980
So we have our NAV bar set up as well as our Sidebar widgets.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.900
So we're almost there in the next video.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.330
I want to work on the search.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:03.850
We'll put a search box and also the single pages because right now if we click on a post it brings us

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.980
to the right post but we want it to look different than this.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.240
OK we want the image to be bigger and so forth.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.760
OK so I will see you in the next video.
