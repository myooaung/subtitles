WEBVTT

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.160
You guys in this video we're going to work on the Showcase area here to start with and then we'll go

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.380
from there.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.060
So what we're going to do is go to functions not ph P and we're going to have a separate file for the

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.850
customized.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.990
OK.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.360
So what we're going to do here is we're going to say re-acquire.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.990
Actually I want to see required get a template directory

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:47.890
and then we just want to concatenate slash ink slash customize or dot ph p.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.750
All right.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.480
And then we're going to create a folder in our theme called ink and create a file save it as customize

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.940
or dot HP.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.500
All right.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.880
So right here we're going to say p p and then function clean cut underscore

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.580
customize underscore register.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.250
All right.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.220
And then right beneath that function we're going to do an action.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.220
And the hook that we're looking for is customized register.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.540
And then we just want to plug in this function name.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.030
All right.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.310
So first we want to do is add a section.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.720
OK.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.980
So I wanted to just paste this in to save some time.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.510
Basically we're saying we're taking W.P. customize which we actually have to pass in right here.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.130
All right.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.250
And then we're calling add section we're calling it showcase.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.270
Then it takes an array of options.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.960
We have a title which will be showcased description and then we have a priority.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.240
OK which is 130.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.370
I want this to be at the bottom of what's there now.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.540
OK so let's go ahead and save that.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.260
Now I don't know if it's going to show up where we have no fields but if we click customize.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.670
OK.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.970
So it's not showing up yet.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.800
We need to actually add a setting in a control.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.110
All right.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.750
So let's go back in and let's go right underneath.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.810
And I want to add a setting for the heading I saw paste this in.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.490
Basically we're saying W.P. customize ads setting.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.790
We're calling it showcase heading.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.020
The default is just going to be the next clean cut theme and the type is going to be a theme mod.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.940
All right so that that gives us the setting.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.050
But now we need a control.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.840
So we're going to face this soon.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.230
So now we're using AD control.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.520
Same thing showcase heading you wanted to match that.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.610
We have a label.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.060
It's just going to say heading.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.480
And then the section we want is showcase OK which is the one we created.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.080
So if we save that and then go back and reload.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.890
Now we have a showcase section if we click on that.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.690
We have a heading control now for the text is going to be basically the same thing I'm going to copy

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:53.020
the setting and the control here and paste that in and then we'll just change this stuff say text.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.140
And we want to change it to showcase text and the default

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.710
K type is fine.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.580
Want to change this down here to showcase text as well.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.570
Change this to text section showcase.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.050
And we're just going to change priority to 4.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.710
All right so now if we go back and reload now in Showcase we also have the text option.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.600
All right so now we're going to do the image the background image.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.500
We're going to put that up at the top right below where we put the section I am going to paste the send

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.890
.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.300
OK so what we have here is the setting showcase image the default.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:00.160
We want to set that to the default image which is in the template directory and then I add the I Am

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.880
G folder and then a file called showcase start a peg which you should already have in there should be

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.270
included in your theme files or your project files for the control.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.890
We're doing something different instead of just putting in an array.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.860
We're putting in this new WP customize image control.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.670
All right and then down here we have the array with the label section settings and all that.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.190
We have a priority of one.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.750
I want that at the top.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.640
So let's go ahead and save it reload now and showcase.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.580
We have this image option.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.190
Now it's not showing up there and I don't know why.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.390
See.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.010
IMAGE.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.070
Oh I don't have my images in there.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.740
So let me just grab those.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.000
So I'm just pasting in the showcase started jpeg and the banner dot J drag.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.780
So now you can see that we have this default image.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.850
So next is going to be the height of the banner.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.170
So let's do that.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:17.300
I'm going to go right underneath the image control and we're going to paste that in.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.840
So it's a height setting and a height control

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.600
showcase height.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:29.340
The fault is going to be 700 and then down here we have the control.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:37.850
Priority is going to be to save that and that should be it for the showcase section fields.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.000
OK so it should look like this.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.900
Now let's actually implement this.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:57.070
So what we want to do is let's open up head or head or drop each p and we have this in here because

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:04.780
this came from the index h t m l what we want to do is make this dynamic so the showcase height we're

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:20.230
going to get rid of that and in here we want to say ph P go get theme mod and what we're looking for

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.680
is show case height.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.630
OK and then the default that we want here is seven hundred.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:28.980
All right.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:35.050
And then we do want the X for the pixels.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.810
All right.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.550
And then for the image background image here let's copy that.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:46.450
We just did and we'll put that in here.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:53.060
OK we want to change showcase height to showcase image.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:08:04.830
Now for the default we're going to say Get blog info and we're going to pass in template you rl.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.060
And then just concatenate slash.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.550
I am g slash showcase door.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.210
Jay peg.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.420
All right so we'll save that.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.180
Let's go to the front end.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.270
So now we have our background image and we can now change it.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.160
We can also change the height.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:28.030
OK.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.990
So let's say we wanted to change this to 400 that go.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.590
It changes it here.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.410
If we save it and go to the front end it also changes.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.230
OK.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.200
So put that back.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.050
So we have the image and the height.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.840
Now we need to implement the heading text and the text text.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:59.830
So let's go back to actually we want to go to index ph P and go right here and I'm going to paste this

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.270
and get the mod.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:05.020
Cept it's going to be showcase heading.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:18.340
And then for the default text you'll see a clean cut theme and then let's do the text

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.150
I save that

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.150
load and there we go.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.830
So we can now edit the heading the text the image and the height.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.890
So now what we want is the social buttons.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.000
KADISH we should be able to specify our profile or else.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:58.100
So what we're going to do is go back to the custom Isar and we're going to create a whole new section

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.130
.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.470
So let's go right here

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:12.010
and I'm going to pace this in case so this is the social section just called it social priority is 140

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.540
I wanted to go underneath the showcase.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:24.250
And then the first setting and control we want is the Facebook you are all going to paste that in.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:24.650
All right.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:30.640
So basically this is just called Facebook you are l our default is just going to be Facebook dot com

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:35.580
no actual profile and then we have the control.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:36.630
All right.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.800
The next will be Twitter.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.220
So paste that in.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:48.700
It's literally the same exact thing except for using Twitter you r l k.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.550
Same thing with Linked In.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:51.790
It's good.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.190
Place that in.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:56.970
OK.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.700
So I'll save that.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:05.810
And then in the back end here on the Customize are we now have a social section.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.690
Click that and we have our swings.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:08.990
All right.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:14.270
So right now we haven't implemented them in the front end so let's do that.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:23.980
We're going to go to index ph P and go down to where we have all of our social icons here.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:31.610
Now remember if we don't have any text in the as the R L then we don't want the button to show so we

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.000
just need to do a simple IF statement.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.230
All right so let's go to

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:48.610
let's see we're going to go right above the Facebook URL button and we'll say p p f

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.690
get theme mod

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.150
Facebook you are l.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:14.430
And we also want the default here as well which will just be Facebook dot com.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:26.430
So we're going to say if it is not equal to nothing OK then we want this to show.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.120
No I'll just say ph P and F

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:41.330
and we want to go to the eight track which there isn't one here actually.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.430
So we need to create that.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.490
OK so this will be THP echoed get theme maade

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.630
Facebook you are out

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.000
and the default

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:09.980
.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.110
And I also want this to open a new page.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:21.980
So we're going to put the target attribute set that to underscore blank.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.390
OK.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.180
So that takes care of the Facebook.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.490
Now just to make this easy you're going to copy this whole thing we just did from the if statement down

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:37.190
to END-IF copy and then replace these two down here.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.030
OK and then we'll just change this one to Twitter

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:52.140
.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.780
OK.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.630
And then we'll change this one here to Linked In

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:25.890
.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:26.310
All right.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.510
So save that

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.370
and let's go take a look.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.270
OK.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.390
So let's make sure that we can actually change it.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:46.610
Now if I was to just get rid of this totally the hold the button goes away which is what we want.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:46.970
All right.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:53.280
So let's say Facebook dot com slash test save.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.900
Go to the front end.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.660
And that brings us to Facebook dot com slash test.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:14:59.900
All right.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.380
So now we have our social icons set up.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:11.240
Now we're going to want the same functionality in the former our I'm sorry the banner so I'm actually

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.110
going to grab

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.000
this grab from here.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.750
This is the first checking for the Facebook.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:34.250
You are actually going to grab all three of these and copy and then down in the banner we're going to

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:39.090
replace this UL and then we'll just add the US back.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.850
So paste that in.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:47.980
Actually it's not replace the well we're going to just replace all the allies.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:48.380
All right.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.920
And then we simply need to just add ally to each of these

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:04.990
.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:05.930
All right.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.910
Save that.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.700
And there we go.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.740
Now the banner I want on every page.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.200
So instead of just having to add it to every single file.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.810
Let's just put it in the folder.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.260
So I'll grab that.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:27.080
Cut it out and go into photocopy each piece and put it right at the top

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.440
and there we go.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:34.150
OK.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:41.210
Now we still have to implement the customize our options for the folder as well as some of the other

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.570
stuff.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.350
So we're going to do that in the next video.
