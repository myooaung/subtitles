00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.510
You guys welcome to the last video in this project in this video we're going to be adding the custom

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.490
comment functionality.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.220
All right if we go to one of the blog post and go to the bottom you see we have no comment functionality

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.470
.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:25.640
So what we'll do is open up single dot PDP and let's go right under this and if we're going to say ph

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.330
the comments template.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.960
OK so if we save that and we go and reload we have our comment section.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.470
All right so it's a great post post comment and it works.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.820
All right.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.620
Now this will work as far as functionality goes but it doesn't look too good.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.820
So I want to show you how we can customize this.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.600
So what we're going to do is create a new page or a new file and we're going to call this comment start

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.980
p p k if we go back now and reload you'll see there's nothing here.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.490
It's reading from this file.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.830
If we say test reload we get test.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.570
All right so it's up to us to customize how we want this to work.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.080
So let's first of all put each to handle say comments.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.390
All right.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.160
And there's actually some helpful code in the documentation

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.140
for our W.P. list comments.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.880
And this is what we want.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.960
OK so we can create an argument array.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
So I'm going to grab that.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.300
OK.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.780
So obviously most of the stuff we don't need.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.070
But I mean it's not going to hurt us to keep it in there.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.920
You'll see a lot of this is set to now.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.390
But just in case you wanted to change anything later on.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.720
All right.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:11.400
I am going to change the Avatar size to Haiti make it a little bigger but that's really it.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.500
The rest we can kind of leave.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.920
All right.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.180
Now this argument these arguments will get plugged into the W.P. list comments function.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.470
So let's go ahead and do that

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.180
.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.950
OK.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:40.200
We're going to pass in args and comments.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.560
All right so that takes care of the comments generally need to form.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.650
So that can also take some arguments.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.010
See if it's on this page

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.910
.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.490
See that comment form.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.220
That's all we want

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:08.740
.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.270
So down at the bottom here I'm going to grab this code

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.110
paste that in.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.250
This needs a peach tag.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.090
All right so what we're doing is setting another argument array comments args actually let's call this

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.940
form args.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.670
And then down here change this to form args.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.560
OK so we can relate the label of the submit button.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:47.700
What you want in the title reply field comment after comment notes after and then the comment field

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:56.070
itself which in this case they give you a paragraph with the class of comment form comment has a label

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.290
.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.890
I don't think we really want to change anything here.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.950
Let's go ahead and see what this does.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.170
Will save it the load.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.290
OK.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.910
For the textarea I'm just going to add in couple attributes.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:23.190
Calls will set calls to 45 and let's set rows to 8

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.590
.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.400
All right that's good.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.090
The rest of it will do in CSSA.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:43.020
All right so what we're going to do now is go to style C Ss go down to the bottom and I'm going to paste

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.500
this in.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.320
This is going to be the comment body.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.900
Give it a border margin and padding.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:56.650
We also want the matter which is this area here the avatar and then the date and all that stuff paste

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.870
that in.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.990
OK we're going to add a dark background some padding.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:08.530
The image I'm going to float to the left the time I add some margin to that next you want the comment

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.550
.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.810
Body.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.750
No we already did that.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.700
We know that we want the Reply link King and it's going to format that to look like a button.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.700
And then the form itself we need that as well so it's paste that in.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.830
OK we'll get the form input in the text area or just setting with to 100 percent.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.490
We're adding some padding border stuff like that.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.470
So I'd save that and reload.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.770
And there we go.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.120
That looks a lot better.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.350
It's typed something in here actually you know we can do is log out and different.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.180
We're logged out.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.460
Then we also have the name e-mail and Web site fields.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.970
All right so I think that looks pretty good it looks a lot better than the default state.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.920
This is a great article

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.210
.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.870
And and there you go.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.240
All right.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.960
And since we weren't logged in and just it says it's waiting moderation and that that's good it's working

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.180
great.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.870
So that's pretty much it.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.240
Guys we're done.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:35.460
Like I said this isn't the purpose of this project wasn't to build a beautiful theme it was to really

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.550
get you familiar with the different files that we need to create the syntax the different functions

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.870
things like that.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.190
All right.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.460
So hopefully you enjoyed this project and I'll see you in the next one.
