00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.550
You guys in the last video we went ahead and finished up the age html template.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.770
Now we're ready to convert that template into a WordPress theme.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.980
So here we have a fresh installation of WordPress.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.270
I haven't done anything to it at all.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.610
All right.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.780
So use this as our starting point.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.480
And over here you can see I have the folder open up I just called it W.P. themes.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.790
All right.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:31.170
So first thing we need to do is inside of our W.P. content folder we're going to want to create a theme

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.360
inside of the themes folder here.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.900
All right.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.360
So let's say new folder and I want to call this photo genic.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.180
OK now first single going to want to create in here is a style Dotsie SS file.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.740
OK because this is where we need to put all of our theme data.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.690
So if at the top we need to put this in a comment.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.140
So we want to format it like this.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.600
All right.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.380
And then we need a theme name

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.660
which is going to be photogenic.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.400
We don't want that.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.860
And then let's do author.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.990
You can put your own name.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.340
OK next will be author.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.340
You are I.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.120
And you can put whatever you want here.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.510
I'm just going to put edge on X dot com and white keeps you given a semi-colon.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.010
OK.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.230
Next thing will be description.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:54.200
So for the description we'll say photo gallery theme and then will do version.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.240
So at one point all point 0.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.820
And that should be good.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.630
So what I'll do now is save this.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.420
And we should now actually see it inside of our admin area.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:18.010
So it's reload and then go to parents and then themes in each template.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.690
All we need to create an index file of course.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:31.050
So let's create new file and save it as index dot ph P K and then if we go back and reload you can now

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.110
see we have photogenic.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.460
Now I do actually have a screen shot that I want to upload.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.400
So it's open up.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.530
Let's see we're going to want to go to X.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.580
Or wherever your Wordpress installation is.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.100
And what's the word W.P. themes.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.530
We want to go into photogenic and you want when you want to use a screen shot you want to call it screenshot

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.750
dot PNB.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.190
OK.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.740
So that's what I'm putting in there.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.010
And now if we go and reload now we have a little screen shot.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.710
OK so let's go ahead and activate this theme and then if we go to the front end and reload.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.030
Obviously we're not going to get anything.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.460
OK so now we can start to put this together.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.140
So I think the first thing to do here.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.880
One of the easiest is just to put in the style of CSX.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.610
All right so what we'll do is open up the style sheet from each team all template and I'm going to just

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.020
copy everything and then put it right under the comment here.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.950
And I save that in now.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.810
OK.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.190
So that's not still not going to do any thing because we have nothing in our index ph p.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.440
So it's close that.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:57.000
And let's go to index BGB and what we'll do is we'll copy everything that we have in our index h t m

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.750
l file

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.260
and paste that in and save it and then if we're going to reload.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.290
OK.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.420
So it's going to show us all this just static aged him OK.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.850
None of this is coming from WordPress So we're going to solely just convert it from just static markup

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.720
to WordPress.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.910
All right so let's go to the top here.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.160
And first thing we're going to do is we need to include the correct style sheets.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.620
So what we'll do is we're going to leave this one which is the W3 schools see the end and then right

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:47.490
here we're going to take out this style thought SS and we're going to put in here ph P blog info.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:05:00.700
And in here we just want to put in a style sheet underscore you r l k if we save that and then go and

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.670
reload.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.100
Now that style sheets being included.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.770
OK.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.180
We're not seeing the images because there's that the path is wrong but we'll get to that later.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.050
All right so that's the head area.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:22.370
Now another thing we want to put in here is the W.P. head function and that's going to put any any head

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:31.330
to content that we need and like say in extra stylesheet for a WordPress plugin or something like that

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.060
.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.230
So let's say P P and then W.P. underscore head.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:46.540
And that should take care of it and then we also want the the character set so we can go right here

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.740
and say Metta

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.870
char set and we're going to set that to each P..

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:05.590
We're going to use blog in full again and then inside here we just want to put char set.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.650
All right.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.790
And that looks good.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:19.790
Now for the H-1 here I'm actually going to make this dynamic.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.130
So we want to say p p

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.040
log info

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.630
and we want to use name.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.960
All right so let's save that and see what that gives us.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:42.910
All right so let's see what we messed up here.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.990
I said this

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.920
you know oh what's this.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.450
Yeah that needs to have an ending.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.080
Great advance sign.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.290
There we go.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:07.870
OK so WordPress themes and that's going to give us whatever the site name is which we can change inside

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.150
the admin area and don't worry about this.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.530
This spacing up here we'll get to that after.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:16.410
OK.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:22.330
So let's see what else do we need to do here for the body.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.760
We actually want to include the body class function here.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:31.090
So we're going to say ph the body understood for class

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.610
.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.930
Now this stuff I'm going to leave for now the main content for the footer.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:55.150
What I want to do is grab this whatever the name of the blog and put that down here just like that.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.070
OK.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:04.440
Now we're going to want to do is split this up into a header and footer.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:14.740
So what we do is inside our folder here let's create a new file called Hetter dog ph P and also for

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:21.540
dog p p k and then let's figure out what we need to put in the head.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.350
So we want from the very top

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:32.400
and I actually do want to include this side here in the header files so we want to go down to.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.190
I would say this row.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.150
OK.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.100
Because from here down we want that to be in the index.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:53.680
So let's grab all this or cut that out put it inside the head or file save it k and then just bring

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:59.940
this up and then for the footer Let's figure that out.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:09.370
So we're going to want this to be the last div in the index so everything under that saw cut that.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:19.240
Put that in for save it and then inside index let's just bring all this over that.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.270
OK.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.690
So if we reload now you can see that all we're getting is the index file we need to include the header

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.790
and footer in this file.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.000
So let's do that.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.650
And that's extremely easy.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.050
All you need to do is save ph.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.150
Get better.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.470
All right.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.990
And then we're going to do the same thing for the footer.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.310
So this will be good for her.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.290
OK.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:51.610
Now if we go back and reload now it's back to normal.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.420
So let's actually change the name of the site.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:05.160
So if we go to the settings general we're going to change this to photogenic.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.890
OK so now that should change.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.970
And there we go.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.870
So now we have our header and footer and the next video we're going to start to look at the content

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.610
and the post because that's we want the post to be showing in the index.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:21.930
OK.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.630
So we'll get to that next.
