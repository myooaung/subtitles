WEBVTT

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.330
OK so we have our home page and blog page and we're going to start to take care of the single pages

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.520
.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.240
So I want to start with the post.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.060
OK so we click read more.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.480
It brings us to a page like this which you could keep this style with the animation but I rather have

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.960
just a standard single post to lay out.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.490
So what we're going to do is create a new file and let's save that as a single dot.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.900
P p

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.220
Let's go ahead and bring in the header

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.660
and footer

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.750
and then we're going to have our y a loop

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.010
ok and then we're going to have our titlebar so we can grab that from index

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.870
right now instead of just having the word blog is our title since we put this inside the while loop

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.040
we can use the content.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.670
I'm sorry the title as are H-1 so we can say ph be the title.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.200
OK.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.070
Take a look and you can see now we have the actual post-Idol as our title.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:55.990
So now what we'll do is let's go under this section under the title bar and we'll create section give

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.810
it a class.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.940
Actually you know what do is just get it from the HDMI all that we created.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:12.480
So in clean cut each all I'm going to go to single dot HDMI now and let's grab from here

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.380
down to here.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.970
So that section.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.320
OK we're going to post that piece that right here.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.790
And then we're just going to kind of trade the static content for Dynamic Content.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.500
OK.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.560
So we have our thumbnail let's get rid of this and put in a p p post thumbnail

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.280
and for our media content here let's replace the D

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.840
with PH P the time

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:10.050
format that and then we're going to replace the user name here with the author along with the link around

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.260
it.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.400
And that goes to get author posts you Arel and we pass and get the author Mehta as a parameter along

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.590
with the ID.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.060
Now this here will be replaced by the content.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.580
So let's get rid of that

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.850
and then the sidebar stuff will keep that like it is for now.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.870
So let's save that make sure it works OK.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.960
So that looks good.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.670
Aside from not having the comments yet and the static sidebar but this part here is intact.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.900
So what we want to do now is the archive.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.550
So if we were to let's say click on the user it'll bring us to the users post what I want to edit the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.570
title.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.630
So let's create a new file and we're going to save it as archive dot THP.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.980
And I'm going to copy everything that's in the index file.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.750
OK and then we're just going to go up to where we have the H-1

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.940
and we're going to paste in the same code we've been using for the archive title.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.950
Just checking to see for instance if it's a category if it is we're going to use the single cat title

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.870
function and so on.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.290
So let's save that reload.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.230
And now we have the correct type of title.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.610
If I click on a category we get the category name

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.110
now I think that while we're at it we should do the comments.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.490
OK.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.020
So if we go to a single post we want to be able to show a comments area.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:09.500
So let's go to single dot ph P go down to see if we want to go right below the content and let's say

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.160
HP comments template

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.810
save.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.810
Go back and reload and now you have comment functionality.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.370
Let's just post something in here.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.790
OK so that works.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.980
Now it doesn't look too good so we'll style it a little bit before you can style it though.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.410
Going to create a custom layout for our comments.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:42.550
So we're going to create a new file and we're going to save it as comments dot ph P and I just can use

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.380
the standard code we've been using.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.370
OK we have a div with a class of comments of a heading and then we're sending a bunch of arguments this

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.920
is actually from the documentation.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.920
And then we're just going to punch it into W.P. list comments.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.520
Then we have our arguments for the form and then we're going to punch that into comment form so we'll

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.350
save that for you load.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.610
Looks a little different but still not very good.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.640
So we're going to just add some style.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.830
Let's go to our style sheet.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:24.490
Go down to the bottom and we're going to paste the in K so I'll go over it.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.230
We have our comments class.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.940
We have a border padding and margin.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.620
The H-3 has a background of light gray body.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.860
We have a border around the body padding.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.380
The matter has a background of dark gray.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.690
Let's see the mirror image is going to float to the left.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:48.730
We have the time.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.340
We're just going to put a little margin to the left of the time to push it over.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.870
And then the reply link will have a dark gray background.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:03.940
And then we have the input and textarea which will have a 100 percent with and some some border in margin

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.490
.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.110
So let's say that see what it looks like.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.440
Ok that looks a lot better.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.850
So we now have comments.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:20.140
Now let's take care of the sidebar so let's go into functions that P P and we're going to go down here

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.420
and say widget locations.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:35.870
OK so we'll have a function called init underscore widgets.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.820
That's going to take an ID

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.160
and then we want to register sidebar

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.440
pasan a re

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.020
name will be side bar

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:01.990
D

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:13.210
or B also side bar all lowercase and then we're going to do before widget

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.640
.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.310
OK will do that will do after Widger.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.670
And we're going to do before title

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.850
and of course after title

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.420
.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.070
OK so before we.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:09:03.490
Let's take a look at the code so let's go to single ph P And if we look here and what we don't have

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.020
the animation do we.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.090
OK so I want to be able to add some animation here.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.720
So what's actually just leave that for right this second.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:23.170
And we're going to go before widget and we'll have a div give it a class of well also animated

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.820
fade in.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.960
Right.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:34.240
And also sidebar widget.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.130
All right.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:42.630
And then after widget of course we need to close that div and then before title to an H.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:48.480
Very close at age 3 and save.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:54.310
So now back to single dot P P we can actually get rid of this whole thing

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:03.490
and we'll replace it with our dynamic sidebar.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.270
I'll save that.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:14.120
Now we also want it's actually I think that's the only place we want it so far.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:21.130
So if we reload obviously that's gone let's go ahead and add a sidebar widget.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.870
Oh I didn't know the action did I.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:34.870
OK so in functions p p we're just going to do an action.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:44.950
We're going to say widgets in it and then our function name which is in net widgets.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:51.460
And now if we reload you should be able to see the widgets link right here in appearance.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:51.750
All right.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.100
And then what we'll do is take the text widget.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.060
Move that over

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.480
.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.020
And it just grabs and text

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.050
save.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.150
And there we go.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:26.900
So now you can see animate in now that H-3 isn't is and parsing correctly before title each three.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:31.350
Take a look at that.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:32.620
OK.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.510
So that H-3 isn't registering.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.650
Oh I have the quote the double quote.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.780
Outside that's supposed to be like that.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.430
There we go.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.880
OK.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:52.510
So we're pretty much there as far as blog posts go.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:57.620
Aside from being able to have different formats which we'll get to later.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.080
But in the next video we're going to do start to work on the pages.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.800
As you can see if I go to a regular page this is what it looks like.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.850
So that's what we'll do in the next video.
