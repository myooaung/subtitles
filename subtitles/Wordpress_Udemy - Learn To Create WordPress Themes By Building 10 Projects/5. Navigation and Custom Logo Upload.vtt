WEBVTT

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.050
All right guys so we created our H.T. Maol template.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.040
Now we want to turn it into a WordPress theme.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.780
So I have pretty much a default installation default WordPress installation.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.440
I do have a couple of blog posts blog posts one blog post to also create a couple categories.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.340
So I'm going to do is go to my WP content folder and then themes in the themes folder we're going to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.640
create what I want to do that I want to create a new folder

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.480
and we're going to call this business.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.910
OK.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:53.940
And first two files we're going to create is going to be style art style Dotsie SS and of course index

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.550
page.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.570
OK.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.320
So in-style CSX.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.490
We're going to add our comment section up here.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.640
We want a theme name which we're just going to call business theme.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.240
We're going to need author

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.780
say Author.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.540
You are right

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.660
I

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.650
do description

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.280
and version.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.000
All right.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.740
Now one thing to do is open up our HDMI file.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.330
I'm sorry HTML template and I'm going to grab everything that's in that style.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.170
SS OK.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.010
Copy that.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.160
We're going to put it right in here.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.580
Save it.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:23.370
And then let's also take what we have in our index each file name and copy all that paste that in the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.150
index THP file.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.760
OK.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.400
Now we want to bring over some of these files to our theme.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:42.030
OK so let's go to you on the go to your Wordpress installation and we're going to go into themes and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.630
then business.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.730
We're going to bring over the bootstrap and the.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:58.260
Awesome CSSA files into a folder called C-s us in our theme.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:09.320
OK we're also going to bring over foreigns Jay ass and the image folder.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.010
All right.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:19.730
Now to go back to the index aged female file or I'm sorry index page file and save that.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.790
And then let's just make sure we can activate the themes so we're going to go to themes and then we

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.700
have this business theme.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.570
I actually have a screen shot that I'm going to put in there as well which you should have in your program

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.230
files

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.950
just paste that right there in the root.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.700
And now that should show up.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.990
All right so let's go ahead and activate it and if we go to the front end to reload we just see our

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.690
static HVM owl.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.770
All right so let's start to work on this next speech file.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.370
So right here we have this laying equals ECN.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.550
We're going to get rid of that.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:09.370
We're going to make this dynamic by using the language attributes function.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.630
OK.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.370
And then we're going to need the char set.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:30.970
So we're going to just get rid of what we have right here and we're going to say ph P Bulaga info char

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.380
set

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.500
K viewport.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.140
That stuff can stay.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.030
Now for the title we're going to change that.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.100
We're going to save Bulaga info.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.040
Scuse me name

00:04:51.690 --> 00:05:00.870
now for this for the CSSA files this main style Daut CSSA we're going to just replace this with THP

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.840
blog info and we want style sheet.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.510
You are all right.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.470
And then for these two we have to scroll my mouse.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.660
We have to use our template you are out here before we go into the CSSA folder.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:31.710
So we're going to put in our PHP tags and we're going to use blog info again except we're going to use

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.450
template.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.250
You

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.410
we want to we want to do that for bootstrapping for fun.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.390
Awesome.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.680
All right.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:53.130
So let's save that in reload case and you can see it's reading those those CSSA files.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.020
And if we look at our console just to make sure.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.880
All right.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.230
So it's just telling us that these images are there which is fine for now.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:10.190
Now we're also going to need to include the W.P. head function within the each team had.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.330
Her right.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:22.810
And then that should be it for the head area for now in the body tag we want to include the body class

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:23.440
juncture.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.380
So it was safe ph the body class

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.160
now for the menu.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.040
We're going to use that that WP Now Walker class that we used in the past.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.510
So it's

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.340
a we're going to want to put that.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.990
We're going to just grab it here.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.720
Now this will be in your project folder

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.290
.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:07.200
So that's going to go right in the root of the theme.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:16.100
Now we're going to go and create a function's PDP file in our theme.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.580
I keep doing that.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.620
All right.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.730
And we need to require that file

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:45.180
case all they require wants one to require wants WP underscore bootstrapped underscore nav Walker dot

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.500
ph p.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:58.720
So save that let's go back into index and what we're going to do is replace this entire nav tag.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:06.760
OK so we're going to get rid of that and we're going to say going to open up some THP tags.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:13.910
And then in here we're going to say W.P. underscore Nav. underscore menu.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.950
And that's going to take in an array.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:21.580
OK.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.220
And we're going to say theme location

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:35.910
that's going to be set to primary K we're only going to have one menu location in this theme.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.470
Next we'll say depth and

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.270
we're going to set that.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.890
That data to

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.280
carry.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.100
Then we get to container

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.640
that's going to be false

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.630
menu class.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:16.890
Now menu class we're going to use what we did have in the HCM aisle which I forget so I'm going to have

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:23.200
to just look at that real quick.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:36.760
OK so we want this class right here and NAV nav pills and pull right.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.060
So put that right here

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.310
.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.660
OK next let's see we're going to do fall back

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.990
and these need quotes

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:08.220
so far back and the value we want to put here is W.P. underscore bootstrap underscore now.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:14.820
WALKER And then we want to do a double colon and then fall back.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.260
All right.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:23.150
And the last thing we need to include is the walker value.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:33.410
OK this is going to be new WP underscore bootstrap underscore.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.870
Now of Walker and that's a function.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.680
So let's save that and see what we get.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:49.300
OK so there's nothing there right now what we're going to do is go into the back end.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:58.140
And actually before we can do that we need to go back to functions and we're going to set up our theme

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.490
set up function.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.180
So say function business underscore

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.400
theme underscore set up

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:22.630
and let's do the register now have menus

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.380
pass in an array.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.520
And she's going to have one value.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.200
We're going to say primary

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.140
and primary menu

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.200
.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:55.070
And if we go and reload Oh we're going to do the add action

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.290
.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:08.690
OK the hook we want here is after things set up and then the next parameter will just be the name of

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:12.920
this function.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:23.000
Ok so now it's not there oh it's after set up theme not theme set up

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.200
.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.230
OK so now we have a menu's option.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.970
We click on that we wants.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.780
Let's see home and sample page that's good.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:47.260
Now right here theme locations you want to make sure you choose primary menu and save.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.890
Now if we go to the front end and reload there's our menu.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:56.500
OK which works the the active classes also work.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.420
So the next thing we want to do is the logo.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:05.940
Now we've done this before where we've used the W.P. customize or to be able to add a custom logo.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:12.400
So we'll go back to our functions P2P file and go into the business themes setup function

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.850
and all we need to do here.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.450
Very easy we just need to say add Feme support

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:32.630
and we want to pass in here custom load

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.050
.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:45.380
And then in the index file We're going to go to where we want the logo we're going to replace this and

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.790
we're going to replace it with a conditional.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:53.510
We're going to say if so also have an else

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.300
.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:12.020
OK so we're going to check for the custom logo by saying if has custom logo then we want to spit that

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:17.270
out so we'll see p p the custom logo

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.110
else.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:27.700
OK if there is no logo then we want just the the name.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.480
OK so blog in full name

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.250
right.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.510
Let's go back and reload.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.120
Now we don't have an actual logo yet.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:50.600
We don't know we didn't upload one so it's just giving us the name of the name of the site.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:56.750
So let's test it out make sure we can upload a logo we're going to go to customize and site identity

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:56.790
.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:04.130
And you should have this logo area and say select logo and that's see where can I get this

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:13.780
business sieged mail image and logo Binjie.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.940
OK we're going to select that and then I'm just going to crop it.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.210
Crop image save.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.690
Go to the front end reload.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.180
And there we go.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.850
Now there's a space above the header here.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.160
And the reason for that is because that's where the admin menu goes to get that to show up.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:47.830
We're going to go down to the bottom of our aged him now and we're just going to say W.P. for saying

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.590
that we'll add that menu.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:57.690
Now before we end this video I just want to split up the header in the folder into their own files so

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:05.210
let's go and create new file say this is Hetter dot BGP create another one.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.470
And that's going to be FOTR dog page.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.400
Now in the index page let's go ahead and take out what we want to put in the header.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:21.920
So that's going to be from the very top down down to the Stiv right here just above the Jumbotron so

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.260
we're going to cut that and let's replace it with.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.860
It gets better.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:37.970
OK and then we're just going to pace what we have in the header file and then let's go back to index

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:45.000
and let's go from the bottom all the way up to where the footer starts.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.980
OK so we're going to cut that and we're going to replace that with get footer

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:56.870
.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:10.310
OK paste that in the footer save and let's make sure everything's OK which it is.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.550
So we're going to go ahead and start here and in the next video we're going to start to set up our custom

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:22.790
home page and we're going to be using the W.P. customize or to handle the Showcase area as well as these

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.910
boxes.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.720
OK so I'll see you in the next video.
