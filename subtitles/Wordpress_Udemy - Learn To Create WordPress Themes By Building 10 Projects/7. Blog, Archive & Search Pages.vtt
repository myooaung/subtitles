00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.050
The last video we took care of the home page posts which are posts that are in the featured category

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.450
.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.320
So now we want to work on the main blog page which is coming from index start ph P which right now is

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.820
just some static HVM else so let's open up index and first we want to do is up at the top.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.600
We want that banner that that title section.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.520
So let's go right up here right under the header and we're going to create a section and let's give

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.970
it a class actually know what we can do is just copy it from each team.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:50.210
So if we open up blog down each team now and let's just grab it from here.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.560
All right.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.170
So if we save that and take a look at it.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.290
All right.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.030
Let's also grab from our blog page T.M..

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.170
The article with the class of blog post.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.280
So we're going to grab one of those and let's replace the get rid of all these article pose actually

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.440
in the index page Peetie and then we're going to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.220
create our while loop.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.570
Now what I want to do here is I want to basically get all the posts except the featured post so the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.660
ones that are on the home page I don't want to show up here.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:41.400
All right so to do that we're going to say P We're going to create a variable here called No featured

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:52.520
query and set that to new W.P. queery and let's pass in a way.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.960
And what we'll do is say cat.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:06.870
Now we're going we're going to need the category ID and we can get that by going to the categories post

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.680
categories and featured.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.550
And if you look up in the U R L bar you'll see we have I.D. equals three.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.560
So what to do here is just put in minus three.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.800
All right just like that.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.210
And then we want our while loop so will say while

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.950
no featured queery

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.820
have posts

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.950
and then say no featured queery.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.480
It is post

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.720
and while and then we're going to take that article we copy and paste that in just like that.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.980
All right so let's make this dynamic.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.340
We're going to take.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.840
Let's see where we have this did with the class of thumbnail we're going to wrap that in an IF statement

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.870
.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.950
We're going to say if he has post from now

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.990
and have post them now and then we'll going to replace this here with the post from now

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:59.640
on carrying then we have our media area in see for the admin for the user and then they just go ahead

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.690
and grab this

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.760
case so just like look just like we've done in other projects.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.420
We have the author here we're getting the author's name and we're wrapping it in this link which will

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.470
take us to an archive with all the author's posts.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.630
All right so for the day let's replace this.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:33.210
That will give us the date and time and then for our category list.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.160
Going to pace the set.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.660
OK so we're getting categories from this function here and it's an array so we're going to go ahead

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.780
and loop through and then output the categories with a link to the archive.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.770
All right.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.140
Now down here we need the title.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:04.220
So we're going to say ph P the title and we want this to link to the correct post.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.490
We're going to say ph P the permalink

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.460
and this will be the content

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.310
I'm sorry the EXOR

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.200
OK let's save that.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.580
And let's go back to the blog page reload.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.230
OK.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:39.290
So we're not getting the excerpt for some reason P The X are.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.140
All right so something's wrong here.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.220
It looks like it's a never ending loop.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.110
Let's see.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.290
So let's take a look at this.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.930
No Ficci query equals W.P. query cat.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.420
And then we have our while loop.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.890
Oh I put is post.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.990
It should be the post.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.580
All right let's try that.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.070
There we go.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.630
OK.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.010
So now it looks good

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.580
except it's getting pages as well.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.940
When we design pages and check the posts here we have services they put in posts I didn't realize that

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.530
.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.900
All right.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.440
So let's get rid of those

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.800
and then that should fix it.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.490
There we go.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.810
OK.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.710
So for services let's add that as a page

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.420
I was wondering what happened because I remember creating services but I didn't see it in the pages

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.260
.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:01.990
And we can also add that to the menu.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.550
OK so now we have our blog page.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.630
And why would we are here we might as well create our archive and search results page because it's going

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.070
to be very similar to this.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:28.050
So what we can do is copy everything that is in index and let's create a new file called archive Daut

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:36.500
TGP will create a new file called search dog pee pee.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:42.070
All right so in archive we're going to paste the scent and go up to where we have the H-1.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.980
I'm going to replace this paragraph with this.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.810
This is code that we've been using throughout the course for our archives checking to see if it's a

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.180
category or if it's an author archive whatever it is.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.970
And then displaying the correct heading.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:05.760
All right so now for instance if we go and click on this business this category it takes us to the business

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.700
archive.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.060
OK we'll just post that that are in.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.400
Wait a minute this isn't right.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:21.380
Oh we need to fix the while loop because right now it's a custom query.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:30.790
So we're going to get rid of this featured query and then just remove it here and here.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.180
OK.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.860
So it's just a plain old query.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:41.340
And then if we reload or cook and steward again click on business now it only shows us the business

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.280
.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:42.960
All right.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:51.110
And then we'll copy what we have here an archive pasted in search and go up to the banner and we'll

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:59.470
get to change this actually will just take what's in this paragraph and I'll say search results.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.240
Ok so now if we were to let's go to a post

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:17.440
and put in the word hello and then go to our front end and search for polow

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:24.200
.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:25.950
That shouldn't happen

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:33.830
.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.260
That's the test right.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.130
So it's just showing all of our posts.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:53.610
You know what I think they might have gone to the wrong place let's go to Hatter and then go to what

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.450
is our form

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:08.160
right here form method equals get and then oh yeah this let's take that out and we're going to say Acco

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:17.290
escape you are l and then in here I'll put it in home you r l.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.300
And then just in a slash.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.460
I think that should work.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.150
They say hello and enter.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.850
And there we go.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.860
OK.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:35.610
So now the searches is functioning properly and the next video we're going to take care of the single

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.190
post view gave we click read more.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.610
That isn't what we want.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.210
It's showing the index not peach P file.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.120
So we'll get to that next.
