00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.700
They guys in this video we're going to get our age team all template set up.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.250
Now we're going to do a little bit of cheating because this AInc framework actually gives us some really

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.160
nice I guess boiler plate or starter templates that we can use.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.040
And we're not going to have to do a lot of the markup manually.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.410
So what we're going to do is go to the INC Web site and we are going to go to Cookbook and this gives

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.310
you a whole bunch of options to start with.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.990
All right another one that we want is going to be this right here this carousel.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.130
All right so if we want to look at an example of it and this is what it looks like.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.260
All right.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.980
We have does the slider or the navigation down here.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.550
This one also has its own navigation.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:00.600
And then this bottom one is carrousel or just a big slideshow and the image should load in a second

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.070
.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.750
These images are coming from Lorem pixel which is just a free image site.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.020
So they're taking quite a bit to load up.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.430
But we're not going to be using this what we are going to be using this but not we're not going to have

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.450
it this big.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.090
It's going to be in about half the size of this.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.470
All right.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:28.720
So what we'll do is go back and click on source and this is the HVM owl for our age old template.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.270
Now there's a lot of stuff going on here.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.240
There's a lot of javascript there's a lot of referencing to javascript files and CSSA files and everything

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.380
here is pretty much done through the Cdn links.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.980
OK so you can see all the scripts here are being loaded from CD and dog ink dog Sampo or Sapele.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.390
So we're going to keep it that way.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.560
So we don't have to include them all locally and we're just going to copy that and then I have an empty

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.060
folder called W.P. news underscore each DML and we're going to create an index file here

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.310
indexed on HMO.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.250
And let's open that up with sublime

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.290
and then we're just going to paste everything that we just copied OK I will save that.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.790
And let's open that up and there we go.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.690
So we have a lot of the work is already done for us.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.960
Now we are going to want a header.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.340
OK because this doesn't have any kind of head or menu.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.880
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.940
We're going to go into our HMO.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:59.120
Let's change the title here to W.P. news template and we can also get rid of a bunch of stuff.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:08.130
I want this to be as short as possible so let's get rid of things like the description Matt author it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.610
is.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.450
It is a responsive web site so we have the viewport.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.320
Things like that.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.280
So I am going to keep that stuff down.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:26.750
Here we have links to icons and fab cons which you could get rid of but I'm just going to keep it.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:34.010
And then the CSSA files these are being loaded from the CD and we can get rid of this.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.500
We can get rid of this here.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.050
And I'm not interested in that.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.860
These are javascript files loaded from the CD and some styling.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.970
I'm not exactly sure why they put this here but I'll just leave it and get rid of these.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.600
Anything that's in comments

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.790
I'll just shrink this up a little bit.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.670
All right.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.560
We want to keep this as is the navigation and you want to keep all these carrousel script tags

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.760
and yeah that should be good.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:21.060
So let's go ahead and add the head we're going to go up to the top right under the body tag and we're

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:30.290
going to put in a header tag we're to give it a class of ink grade.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:40.430
They want to use the grid system and then we're going to have a div class of vertical space.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.300
And then we're going to have a panel

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.100
.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.240
All right.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.180
A panel is basically this right here this white background with the border.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.580
All right we want it to be in a piano.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.650
And then we're going to have an H-1.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.510
This will be the site name.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:14.010
For now let's just say W.P. news and then we'll have blow open up some small tags and that's where the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:23.000
tag line or the description will go we'll say another word Press website and this obviously this will

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.910
be dynamic when we actually create the template under that we're going to have our navigation.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:37.130
So we're going to say Nav. give it a class of ink dash navigation

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.080
and then side there will have are you well we're also going to give that a class when you were a class

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.350
of menu horizontal

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.840
and black

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.470
OK.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.390
And then we have our allies.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.330
So have a class of active.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.310
OK very similar to bootstrap.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.840
And this will just go to nothing.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.500
For now I'm actually not going to index each team at all

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.370
.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.350
And let me just intent this a little bit

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:46.790
.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.880
All right let's copy this.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.310
Put some other links in here.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.840
Say about and let's say blog.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.810
All right so let's save that and see what it looks like.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.250
All right so that's what we want.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.150
We have our Hetter tagline and menu.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.650
Now under that we're going to want another panel with a search bar.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:25.880
All right so let's go right below the header and let's put it in a form with the class of ink to read

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.700
and then we're going to have a div that the class of ink read

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.330
inside that will have a panel

00:07:49.230 --> 00:08:02.270
in the panel we're going to have a div with a couple of classes control group and also a append button

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.490
.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:17.240
And then here we have another div give it a class of control and then all dash one hundred OK want to

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:31.300
take 100 percent of the width and then we'll have an input text input and it's given a name of S and

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:36.820
let's give it a placeholder.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.700
OK so it's indented a little bit

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:51.440
.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.870
OK take a look.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.650
All right so that's short.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.830
I wanted to extend all the way across.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:17.500
Oh you know what the issue is this form shouldn't be ink grade it should actually be informed.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.500
There we go.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.280
OK.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.490
So that looks good.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:32.150
Now this down here we're going to have we're going to put this into half of color or a half a div and

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.970
then have the popular pose on the other half.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.520
And I also want to put that right here in the middle of these two.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.280
OK.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.770
So bear with me.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:52.140
I'm just going to go down to right here this is where we have the big is that it.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.580
No that's not it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.500
Right here

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:06.950
so let's go from the div down to

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.100
see where it is.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.990
And right here this div I believe know this div

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.600
actually toilettes click on it and then it'll show me which one it ends at.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:22.900
OK.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:29.930
So it's this one.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:37.760
So we're going to cut that out and then we want to be in between these two case we want to be in here

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.900
which I believe is right here.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.360
Let's do a test.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.110
Yeah.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.080
OK.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:11:00.010
So before I pasted in we're going to add some and some of our own lock up.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:06.250
OK we're going to give this a class of AInc grid.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.470
Let's give to the class of panels as well.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.420
OK.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:21.470
And then inside there we're going to create a class of call them group

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.990
.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.610
And inside there we want to have two.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.970
If we were using bootstrap there would be two 6 column divs but they do it a little different.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.710
They do it by I guess percentage.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:45.800
We're going to want to 50 percent divs so half and half the way that we do that is we use a class called

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.260
all Dasch 50.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.040
All right.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.320
All Dasch a hundred would be across the whole page.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.200
So we want all 50 there.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.970
And then we want another one.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.830
This is how the grid system works.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:14.240
I think it's a little different than bootstrap it's let's say test on test 2

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.050
and then we go see how this one has this side.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.530
This one is the side.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:26.730
So we want the slider or the carousel to be in this one.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:34.520
So let's put an H to here and we'll say featured

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.810
stories.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.360
All right then I'm going to paste what I copied down below.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.950
OK so we get this.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:55.250
Oh actually no we don't need this div with the panel vertical space because we have that panel of there

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.290
.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.480
So let's get

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:04.550
it out there and get that out.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:12.900
OK and then we're just going to tab these over.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.540
OK.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:25.570
So let's just see what that gives us and save it.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.750
OK so you can see we get the featured stories takes a minute for the images to load.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.610
It won't be like that when we use when we create our WordPress theme because the images won't be coming

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:43.400
from some remote place they'll be in our WordPress site.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.370
All right.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.920
So we get a little slideshow here.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.370
So this side will be the popular stories.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:14:03.290
So let's go ahead and add that that's going to be in the other all 50 div which is right here.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.960
You put an age to here.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:15.870
Right now the mark up we can actually get from the ink site I believe.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.520
Yeah I want to see how this this article page.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.720
We want this this part here in the on the right.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.220
So let's look at the source and see if we can find where that is.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.920
I believe it's this.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.460
No it's this right here this half gutters.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:43.330
So what we want to do is grab this well right under the related heading.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.920
So go ahead and copy that and then we're going to pass that to right here.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.880
All right let's see what that looks like.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.260
Awesome.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.910
OK we're not going to need that many.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.730
Let's get rid of two of those

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:11.260
.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:16.420
There we go.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:20.240
All right so I think that that's pretty much it for the HVM now.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.160
Now we just need to turn this into a WordPress theme.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.750
We're going to end up doing this.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:32.880
The inner page is the single page is that from within the theme itself as opposed to in this age female

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:33.630
template.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.560
All right so start to work on the word press theme next
