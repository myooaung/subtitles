WEBVTT

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.190
All right.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.540
So our front page is looking good.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.910
Now we're going to move on to the blog page so we don't have a link for our blog.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.410
So let's go create that.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:21.560
We're going to go to menus and taste a blog add to menu and save menu reload if we click on blog.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.790
It's basically just all static content because we put all of our stuff all of our code in our front

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.750
page.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.350
If we look at index BHB it's still just all static.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.650
Right so we're going to have to change this quite a bit.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.480
First off let's get rid of the Jumbotron we're not going to use that we are going to use a section for

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:52.970
a page title and I'm actually going to paste that in case we have a section as a class of titlebar.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.320
And basically we're just putting in each one with the text of blog.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.660
All right.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.850
Now down here these are the three boxes we don't want those either so we're going to get rid of that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.390
entire section.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.830
These here are the widgets but they're still the static content.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.320
What we can do is grab the code from front page

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.140
where we have these.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.770
Copy that and then we'll bring that to index and let's replace these two sections

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.730
.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.910
OK.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.470
So save us take a look.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.320
All right.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:48.500
So we have our titlebar we have our two widgets in our footer widgets now in the middle here somewheres

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.650
where we need our content.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.430
So let's do section class and we'll say row main

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.090
We're going to have a container.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:19.080
And now we're going to have a sidebar but we only want the sidebar if there's sidebar widgets enabled

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.370
.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:32.160
So what we'll do is we'll do an if statement here will say if it is active sidebar and then pass in

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.600
the text sidebar

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.140
then I'll do one else

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.210
and then END-IF.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.990
OK.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.920
So the idea that I that I want to do here is that if there is a sidebar we want a div with 8 columns

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.190
if there is in it we want a div with 12 columns because we want to go across the whole page.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.540
So let's go ahead and do that

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.500
.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.200
So if there's a sidebar to be 8 if there's not

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.360
it'll be 12

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.000
K and then of course we need that div to end

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.150
and then if there's a sidebar again we're going to test

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.810
ok if there is then we're going to want a four column div

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.660
just like that.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.350
So say mean side.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.070
Now since there's no side bar enabled we should get a 12 column div.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.230
OK now we haven't added the sidebar widgets so let's do that real quick.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.470
We'll go to functions and just copy that

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.520
sidebar.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.360
Now I want to use bootstrap panels this is something that we didn't do in the aged hemol theme so I'm

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.700
just going to pieces and you guys can copy it.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.720
We just have a div with the class of panel panel default inside bar widget before the title we have

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.100
panel heading with an H3 with panel title.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.800
So we'll save that.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.390
All right.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.790
Now let's go back into what actually before we do that let's just put in our sidebar

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.930
that okay and then let's focus on the main content now.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.140
So of course we want to check for posts.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.760
So say if I have posts

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.910
then we want our while loop.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.370
So we're going to say p p while

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.370
have posts K and then we get to do the post

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.620
.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.240
All right.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:06:00.430
And then here we'll have our article and then we'll have a class of post.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.460
Actually you know what instead of doing typing this all out was just copy what we have and then the

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.820
each team all file.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.270
Ok so I just want to grab the article

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:39.720
and after the article is just for the class of clear and then we'll close that.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.620
All right now this is obviously just static content.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.860
So let's just see what it looks like first.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.480
OK so that's good.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.800
Now we want to just replace the static content with dynamic stuff.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.980
OK so let's do the image.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.630
Get rid of that and we're going to put a div here

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.750
and I'll give it a class of post thumbnail.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:19.050
And then inside there let's check to see if there is a thumbnail and if there is we'll display it.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.290
OK just paste that in.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:31.140
And then for the read more I'm going to replace that with a tag that goes to the permalink

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.070
edge

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.630
.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.690
All right so that's good.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:55.140
Now down here where we have the matter I'm going to replace the the user here in the link

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.010
with this K we're just going to get author post you are l.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.160
You want to pass in as a parameter.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:13.300
Get the author ID and then the author gave for the date.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.210
This is really easy.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.950
You can just say p of the time

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.830
and then we'll just add some formatting in here

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.980
.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:41.470
And then the categories just place that.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:49.890
This is kind of long we have to get the array and then kind to loop through it.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.740
So let me just paste that in case from here to here.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.110
That gets the categories and displays them then down here.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:05.920
This is the easy part we just need to title it in say ph t the title.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.450
And then here will be

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:19.510
the excerpt.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:21.820
All right.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.210
Let's go ahead and reload.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:31.740
OK so now this is all dynamic we're not seeing the image because we don't have one yet.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:38.110
All right we need to add the ability to actually have an image so let's go to functions ph p.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:47.880
We're going to go up to the the business theme set up function and we just need to add that functionality

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.690
.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:58.560
So add Feme support for post thumbnails

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.790
.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:13.560
Now we can go to our backend and I'm going to go to posts blog post one down here we have the featured

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.810
image and the go ahead set that it's See

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:30.080
I'm going to grab blog one diet Jay peg and set that is the featured image update.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.300
OK we'll do the same thing and blog post to

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.410
set that update.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.720
Now we go to the front end.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.210
We have our images.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.560
The width is correct but we need to set the height to Ahto.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.240
So let's go to our style sheet.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.900
We should have article post image right here.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.500
It will say height auto

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.410
correct.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:16.200
Now we need some space up here so let's go to where we have the title bar.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.940
Should be somewhere in here right here.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:26.610
Well let's just add margin bottom 20 pixels.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.230
OK.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.830
So that looks good.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.090
Now for the sidebar widget Let's do that.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:42.780
Let's go to parents widgets and I'm going to grab the categories and bring that to the sidebar.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.490
And we're also going to bring over the archives

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:53.920
here.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:12:01.870
Now if we reload now we have our Sidebar and you can see that with adjusted correctly.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.340
I want to make these look a little different.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:10.050
I'm going to add some CSSA to make this green and also fix up the allies.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:16.450
So it's going to RCF says I'm just going to add in for my panel testing.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.200
Give it the green background.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.470
All right.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.170
And then the sidebar we're just styling.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:32.670
OK this is for the Alwi will add some padding some border to the bottom actually a border around the

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.590
whole thing.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.120
And there we go.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.360
If we click on technology shows us those post business.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.590
All right so that's working great.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:51.330
Now in the next video we're going to take care of the single view pay because right now it doesn't look

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:51.710
too good.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.460
It looks just like the the blog roll.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:13:00.810
And we'll also take care of the archived posts because when we click on let's say a category we want

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.930
the category name to be a peer.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.300
OK.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.390
So we'll get to that next
