WEBVTT

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.630
It the last video we went ahead and created our index each team l file.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.820
We brought in all the style sheets we need javascript's from Foundation and so on.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.850
So now what I want to do is continue on building some of the inner page some of the inner age HTML pages

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.080
.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.760
So go ahead and create a new document.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.370
We're going to call it about each team.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.220
And this is just going to represent the inner pages of our WordPress theme.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.910
All right so open that up and let's just copy what we have in our index.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.180
HDMI I'll just paste that in.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.560
OK.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.160
Now we're going to leave most of this the top bar the header.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.330
Let's see four.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.990
We're going to get rid of these articles.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.490
Actually you know we'll keep one of them and get rid of the other two.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.230
All right we don't need this clear fix either.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.060
We do need the footer.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.590
OK.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.390
Now right below the header.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.550
We're going to have a title section

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.310
so we're going to give us a class of title section

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.970
and let's put a paragraph here with a class

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:37.450
of say class of welcome or welcome text.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.500
And what does what I'm doing here is this if we go to our WordPress site and we go to about we're going

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.190
to have this bar right here.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.900
So this will just say welcome to.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:02.220
And then we'll have an H-1 say about us and then I'm going to paste in a paragraph here with some dummy

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:11.060
text and it's going to have a class of subtext.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:21.210
All right so that's the title bar and then down here we're going to have two columns.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.330
OK we're going to have the sidebar and then the main area.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.050
So let's create a div with the class of row

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.600
and then we need our column divs.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.500
So we're going to save div class large 8

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.130
columns

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.510
and then we're going to have large four columns.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.570
OK so this here is going to be the main area.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:07.670
So what I'm going to do is copy this whole article section and we're going to paste that in here.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.860
OK.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.920
Instead of the class of post-Reagan we give it a class of single page.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.130
All right.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.700
And then let's see we're not going to need

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.040
the date.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:36.790
CAREY So just have an H three paragraph let me just paste in another one.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.290
OK we're not going to need this read more.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.850
We're not going to have this post image carries so that should be the end of the article.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.280
And then the for column div.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.370
We're going to put the div with the class of wow.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.330
Right.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.390
And then there we're going to have to divide the class of the sidebar widget.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.490
And there'll be a sidebar widget div on every widget that we put in.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.870
All right.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.140
So let's put each three

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.600
and then we'll put them paste in the list

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.580
.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.360
And then we will have underneath that will have another side bar where

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.700
you just indent these

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.400
.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.520
And then this one will be archives

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:09.380
and will just say May 2016.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:29.540
All right so now I have to sidebar widgets and that should be good so save that and go back to our template

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.830
if we could about cases that are about page with no styling.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.930
Now we'll move onto the gallery page

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.210
so it's the.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:55.010
We're going to create a new file here and we're going to call this gallery dog HDMI out and open that

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.630
with Sublime Text.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:05.480
And then let's just put in everything from the About page copy that whole thing and then paste it in

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.100
.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.040
All right.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:16.220
And let's start with the title section which is right here and we're going to change this to gallery

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.390
.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.510
All right.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.990
And then down here we're going to get rid of this whole row

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.550
which ends here.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.310
OK even the sidebar.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:41.600
And then we're going to just paste in this section save it.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.760
OK.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.450
Actually let's just do three.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.080
Or do three images.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.830
OK so that's our gallery and you can see we already have the hover effect because we're using the hover

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.760
dots SS classes.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.990
Ok so now for the blog page

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:14.120
.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.880
Open that up

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:26.310
and we'll just copy what we have a copy that we have in gallery.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.660
OK.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:39.380
So we just want to change title to blog and then this whole section we're going to get rid of the gallery

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.970
and then paste in a blog post so it's an article with the class of blog post.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:56.950
We have a row and then we have our thumbnail then we have a div with the class of Metta.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.550
This is going to have the user name the day things like that.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.220
And we're also using fun awesome icons here.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:10.030
Then we have the title which also has a link to the single blog post.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.250
Then we have the content and that's it.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:24.200
So let's copy that article or post and paste it in two more times and we'll just change.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.490
Let's go to the second one.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:31.750
You know change the age to the image to post to Jay peg.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.610
And then the third post will change the image to post three.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.400
All right.

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:39.160
And then we'll go and take a look at that.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.890
And there's our blog.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.700
OK.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:50.950
Now for the single HDMI all we need to create that that's for the single blog post view.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.330
And I know it can be some extra work to basically create the entire site in just HDMI out.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:06.680
But once you get to the world actually programming the Wordpress theme it makes things a lot easier

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.050
.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.410
You can just take the style sheet and just paste it in.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.050
You don't have to worry about that stuff.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:19.100
Maybe some touch ups at the end but I think in the long run it makes things a lot easier.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:25.880
All right so let's copy what we have in about each team and I think that would be the closest and we

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.210
will paste that in and single.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:30.490
OK.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:38.410
And let's go to where we have the top the title section and this will just be the name of the post.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.650
I'll just say one post one.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.900
This will be an excerpt from The Post.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:54.530
And then down here let's change the class to a single blog post

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:03.200
and then we're going to we can get rid of this

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.390
post description div..

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.320
We don't need that.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.870
OK what we want here now is the image.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.400
So I'll say div class post-lunch now

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.840
and in here we're going to have our image tag

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:47.200
in and underneath that will have our Metta image going to paste that in.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:55.940
OK so same thing we just have a well with the user name the date and the categories and then we have

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.920
our title here than the content.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.720
And that should do it.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.880
We have the sidebar in here as well.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.650
So let's save that and go to single aged him now.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.560
And it should look like that.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:09.910
All right.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.160
So we have all of our pages now.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.790
It's it looks horrendous but we don't have any styling yet.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.600
So that's what we'll be doing in the next part.
