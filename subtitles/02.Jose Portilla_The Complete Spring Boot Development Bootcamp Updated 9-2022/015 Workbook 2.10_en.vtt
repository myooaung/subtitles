00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.330
Welcome to Workbook 2.10 already launched the Starter Project and Task one is to create a plain old

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.480
Java object class for employee objects.

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.290
So we will create a new class called employee.

4
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.430
Java.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.420
And inside we will have three fields.

6
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.230
Create the usual getters and setters.

7
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.950
And we'll create a full constructor.

8
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.940
All right.

9
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.690
For returning the view.

10
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.260
We need to add the following objects to the model so we can just copy this over to our workbook controller.

11
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.260
Um.

12
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.170
Seems I already had these imported.

13
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.400
Convenient.

14
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.170
And now we need to add this employees ArrayList to our model.

15
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.860
So we'll say model dot add attribute.

16
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.460
Was there a specific name we had to give it?

17
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.720
Not really.

18
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.520
I'm just going to call it employees and it's going to map to our employees array list.

19
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.990
All right.

20
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.120
Now under the header and staff of HTML, create a table similar to the following.

21
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.310
So our table is going to have some number of rows and three columns.

22
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.640
We'll go ahead and create a table right under our header.

23
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.450
Uh.

24
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.160
There's going to be one row.

25
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.850
That contains a bunch of headers.

26
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.600
It was three headers to be specific.

27
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.030
Okay.

28
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.640
And the headers are name, age and role.

29
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.300
And now every table road that follows needs to be created using a timely loop.

30
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.940
So here we'll say thiamine for each.

31
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.650
And what thiamine is going to do is it's going to loop through every single employee inside of the staff

32
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.340
list.

33
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.450
So the variable expression grabs the stuff.

34
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.430
ArrayList that's inside of our model.

35
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.140
And if each is going to generate as many rows as there are employees inside of the staff array list

36
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.850
and for each row that it generates, that row is going to have three data cells.

37
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.320
And every data cell is going to display text that equals a field that belongs to the current employee

38
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.000
that's being iterated through.

39
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.820
Think about this like it's a regular for loop.

40
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.270
This will display the age of the current employee that's being iterated through and this will display

41
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.370
the employee dot role.

42
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.720
All right.

43
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.950
I think that's about it.

44
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.830
We should be able to run our code.

45
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.870
Local host, 1880.

46
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.290
And it doesn't seem to work.

47
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.900
Huh?

48
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.120
Silly me.

49
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.640
The model attribute is employees, but I passed in staff.

50
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.940
All right.

51
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.660
So here we have our table.

52
00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.160
The first table row is just a bunch of headers, and every row that follows was generated using a leaf

53
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.800
loop.

54
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.500
Now it expects the following output.

55
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.490
So what we can do is add a border to our table.

56
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.959
We'll say a border is equal to solid and we'll give it a width that spans 100% of our page.

57
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.460
And that's all for Workbook 2.10.
