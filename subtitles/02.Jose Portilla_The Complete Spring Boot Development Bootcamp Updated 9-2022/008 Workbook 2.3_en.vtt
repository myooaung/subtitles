00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.770
Welcome to Workbook 2.3.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.320
I've already gone ahead and launched the Starter Project so we can move right into Task One, which

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.050
is inside the handler method at a speed of 45 as a model attribute.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.790
Simple enough, right over here.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.790
Well, first, we need access to the model.

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.710
Model.

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.430
Model.

8
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.840
And then we can say model DOT at attribute.

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.820
The attribute will have a key of speed that maps to a value of 45.

10
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.600
All right.

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.760
And then inside sign HTML, create a header tag that displays the speed.

12
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.430
Simple enough.

13
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.810
We'll go over to templates.

14
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.000
We'll say h one.

15
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.600
Each one.

16
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.480
And actually, I hope this made you think of a triumph expression, because what we're going to have

17
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.180
to do is say, leave text.

18
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.290
And we're going to set this equal to a text.

19
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.950
And when you're writing a plain old string inside of a of expression, you should remember to wrap it

20
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.080
inside of single quotes.

21
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.800
So the string is going to be speed, colon, empty space.

22
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.660
That's going to be our string.

23
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.160
So we can concatenate this static string with the result of a variable expression by using the plus

24
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.710
symbol, and then we can use a variable expression to grab the speed from our model.

25
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.280
So this should say speed 45.

26
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.020
I'm not going to run the code just yet.

27
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.520
Let's do just a little more.

28
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.930
And then it says Create an image element that displays slow down only if the speed is higher than 60.

29
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.020
So here I can create an image element.

30
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.050
This image element will only display if the speed is higher than 60.

31
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.950
So we'll set it equal to a variable expression.

32
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.760
And we'll say if the speed.

33
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.530
Is higher than 60.

34
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.710
Then we want to display an image from our static folder.

35
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.410
So if you go to static slash images, slash slowdown PNG.

36
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.310
That's what we want to display.

37
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.130
If they're going too fast.

38
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.960
I think that's it.

39
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.300
Use timely for timely fun less give the image a with the 200.

40
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.460
Let's give it a width of 200.

41
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.120
Going back here create an image element that displays the speed limit if the speed is lower than 60.

42
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.280
So I'll just copy the following.

43
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.920
And instead of saying Finally F, f, I will say file if unless, which is going to evaluate the opposite

44
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.760
condition.

45
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.380
And if that happens to be the case, if they're going lower than 60 will display will remind them of

46
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.370
the speed limit.

47
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.610
Okay.

48
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.060
I think we're ready to run our code and run these test cases.

49
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.180
May have been clean.

50
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.320
Spring boots run.

51
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.920
Okay.

52
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.580
It will say local host 80.

53
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.180
80.

54
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.240
Speed of 45 reminds them of the speed limit.

55
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.620
What are what were some other test cases?

56
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.290
What if we put 70?

57
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:43.720
So from our controller, we'll pass in a model attribute of speed that maps to a value of 70.

58
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.120
We run our code.

59
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.160
It tells them to slow down.

60
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.000
Beautiful.
