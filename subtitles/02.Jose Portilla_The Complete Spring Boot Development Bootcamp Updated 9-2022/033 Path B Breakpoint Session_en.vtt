00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.290
All right.

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.670
I'm going to apply some breakpoints, actually, just one breakpoint to the application.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.760
I will go ahead and run this app in debug mode.

4
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.720
All right.

5
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.450
And starting from the very top, I'll make a get request on local host 886 grades.

6
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.800
The first the breakpoint hits and the request goes to the handler method get grades.

7
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.940
The handler method adds an attribute to the model that maps to an array list.

8
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.200
The array list has three objects and if I step over model add attribute using the step over button.

9
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.760
You'll see that the model now contains data.

10
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.000
You can drill into it and you'll notice a key value pair.

11
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.750
The string grades is the key, and the value that it maps to is a grades array list with a size of three

12
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.710
objects.

13
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.780
And right before the handler method redirects the user to the grade's view, it's going to send over

14
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.700
this model data to the grades HTML template.

15
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.750
And inside the final leaf template, the variable expression is going to grab the grade's array list.

16
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.270
It's going to generate as many table rows as there are elements inside of the array list.

17
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.890
And for every grade object that it loops through.

18
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.320
It's going to generate a row that shares the exact same name, the exact same subject, and the exact

19
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.160
same score.

20
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.050
And if I press next.

21
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.810
It will do just that.
