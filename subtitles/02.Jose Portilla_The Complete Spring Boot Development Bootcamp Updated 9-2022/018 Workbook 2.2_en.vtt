00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.860
Welcome to Workbook 2.2.

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.960
Please open the starter project by following this path shown in the course resources.

3
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.910
In this workbook, when a user makes a gift request on an empty path, you're going to display a view

4
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.970
that is populated with data from the model.

5
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.090
First, you're going to use all variable expressions, then you're going to use select expressions as

6
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.920
shown previously in the course.

7
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.120
You're also going to use a model and view in a slightly different way.

8
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.070
There's other methods of using a model in view, and so we want to make sure we're versatile in case

9
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.930
we encounter these in the real world.

10
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.150
As always, you can go to learn the part and that's linked for you in the resources.
