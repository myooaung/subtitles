00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.900
Welcome to work.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.890
Book 1.3.

3
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.830
Your first task was to open up the starter workbook.

4
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.380
So what you would have had to do is go to your spring boots, boot camp resources, go to the intro

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.700
to Spring Boot Section.

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.770
Whether using Intel JVs code doesn't matter, go to Workbook 1.3 starter and open up the starter workbook

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.000
as I already did.

8
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.400
And here it tells us about the MAVEN Package Command, which compiles your code into target, and then

9
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.270
it's going to package all of the compiled code inside of a jar file.

10
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.640
The name of your jar file is determined by what you specify inside of your palm XML.

11
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.470
So here the name of our Jar file is going to be workbook followed by the version number dot Jar Snapshot

12
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.940
refers to something that you're packaging, but it's still under development.

13
00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.540
For our purposes, we're going to assume that our workbook application is stable, it's done, and it's

14
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.830
ready to be released.

15
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.310
So we'll remove Snapshot and we'll just say This is version 0.0.0.1 of our app.

16
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.600
We'll spin up a new terminal and we will package our application into a jar.

17
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.740
Package compiles all of our classes, and then it's going to package all of the compiled code into a

18
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.370
jar.

19
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.650
Here we can see our Jar File workbook followed by the version that we specified inside of POM that XML.

20
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.160
This char file contains all of our application's code and now our application is portable.

21
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.450
So what I can actually do is reveal in Finder if you're using a windows, I believe it's called reveal

22
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.780
in file explorer.

23
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.670
Anyways, what I'm going to do is grab this jar file and place it inside of my desktop.

24
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.340
Next task is to actually run the jar file.

25
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.780
So I'm using a mac.

26
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.250
I'll launch a new terminal.

27
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.470
If you're using Windows, select the command prompt, I will open up a new terminal.

28
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.850
Now the terminal by default, it's going to point to your route directory.

29
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.140
If for some reason it isn't, enter the command CD which stands for a change directory.

30
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.820
If you don't follow it up with anything, it's going to go to your route directory.

31
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.560
And what's followed by the route directory is your desktop.

32
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.910
So now I can say CD desktop.

33
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.910
Our terminal now points to the desktop directory where I can run my jar file here.

34
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.160
I can say Java Jar and I'm going to run the workbook jar.

35
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.800
All right.

36
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.570
And this jar contained our code.

37
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.320
We can see that it contained an embedded HTTP server that is now running on port in 1990.

38
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.410
So I can go back here, make a request on port to 1990, and the embedded HTTP server that's listening

39
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.530
on that port is going to return a response.

40
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.490
Beautiful.

41
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.470
All right.

42
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.730
I think that's about it.

43
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.370
Now, if you're using Windows and it says desktop directory not found as you run this command, then

44
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.610
chances are that your command prompt wasn't pointing to your C drive to begin with.

45
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.200
So you're going to have to specify the whole path by saying CD, start from C, drive your home directory,

46
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.530
slash your whatever your username is, which you can autocomplete using tab slash desktop.

47
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.730
If you try that, then make sure that your command prompt is pointing to desktop before you run the

48
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.400
ensuing Java Dash Jar command.

49
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.270
All right.

50
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.920
I hope you enjoyed the solution.

51
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.870
I'll see you in the next workbook.
