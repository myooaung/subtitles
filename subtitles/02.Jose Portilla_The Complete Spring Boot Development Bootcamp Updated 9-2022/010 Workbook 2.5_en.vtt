00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.740
Welcome to Workbook 2.5.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.710
I already went ahead and launched the Starter Project.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.900
Task one tells us that before we return the leaf template, we need to add data to our model.

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.500
So we'll go back to our handler method, whose name is very generic.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.560
We'll say model dot add attribute.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.190
Um.

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.260
We need to add an attribute with key painting that maps to a value of Mona Lisa.

8
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.870
All right.

9
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.470
And Task two tells us to use the leaf switch to compare the model attribute against two possible cases.

10
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.650
And depending on what the user store is inside the model, we're either going to display Starry Night

11
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.510
or we're going to display Mona Lisa.

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.580
Okay, so what we're going to have to do is create a container div.

13
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.800
Diff.

14
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.710
This container is going to contain two image elements one for Mona Lisa and one for Starry Night.

15
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.980
And this container, this div, is going to decide which element to render depending on what the user

16
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.810
has stored in the model.

17
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:21.530
So we'll use the leaf switch and we're going to use a variable expression to grab the the painting.

18
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.450
And then here we're going to compare the painting that was stored in the model against two possible

19
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.350
cases.

20
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.310
One case is Mona Lisa.

21
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.570
And another case.

22
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.460
Is Starry Night.

23
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.600
Now always remember when you're putting strings inside of some sort of leaf expression.

24
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.610
Use single quotes.

25
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.700
Sometimes even I forget to do it and you can feel free to scold me if I do, but always remember to

26
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.290
add your single quotes.

27
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.880
Anyways, if the case match is Mona Lisa, then this image will render, in which case it's going to

28
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.600
render the following image inside of our static folder.

29
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.820
So the path starts that static.

30
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.770
Then we can just say images or we can start with slash images.

31
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.910
Slash Mona Lisa dot jpeg.

32
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.710
And if the case match is Starry Night, then we'll say source.

33
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.930
Is equal to.

34
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.940
Let me just copy the following.

35
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.360
And I'll say Starry Night.

36
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.070
All right.

37
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.680
I think that's about it.

38
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.150
Yes.

39
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.970
We should give each one a width of 300.

40
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.630
Because I believe the Mona Lisa image is really, really big, unlike the one that you would see in

41
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.350
real life.

42
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.620
Okay, let's run the application.

43
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.550
Local host 1880 beautiful displays.

44
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.950
Mona Lisa I think I have devtools in the palm, so let me put Starry Night now.

45
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.180
Great.

46
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:29.800
All right.

47
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.980
Task three is to.

48
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.040
So we're going to have two developments.

49
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.990
One Div will display Starry Night as well as an image.

50
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.040
Another div will display the Mona Lisa title as well as its respective image.

51
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.690
So we'll have one big overarching div.

52
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.840
That contains our two other divs.

53
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.660
So one container is going to display all of the data that's related to Mona Lisa.

54
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.650
So this div is going to display the Mona Lisa image.

55
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.870
And it will display the title.

56
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.810
Mona Lisa.

57
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.290
And this div is only going to render if there is a case match where the painting that we're grabbing

58
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.170
from the model equals Mona Lisa.

59
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.630
All right.

60
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.640
Now we'll just copy this.

61
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.060
Once more, you can delete this.

62
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.470
And if the painting that was passed in equals Starry Night.

63
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.090
Then this div is going to render, in which case the header is going to be starry night.

64
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.360
And we're going to grab the starry night image.

65
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.850
So just to recap, we have one big container.

66
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:11.130
This container has two underlying containers, and this overarching div is going to determine which

67
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.580
div renders depending on which one has a matching case.

68
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.100
Is it the Mona Lisa or is it the Starry Night?

69
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.830
Let's find out.

70
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.400
In this case, it's the starry night.

71
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.290
If I go back and change this to Mona Lisa.

72
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:35.890
Then this div is going to display its underlying Mona Lisa div because of the case match and that is

73
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.800
all for Workbook 2.5.

74
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.750
I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next one.
