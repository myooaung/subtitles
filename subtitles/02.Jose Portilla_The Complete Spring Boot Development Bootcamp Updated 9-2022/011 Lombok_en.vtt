00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.200
Before we write any more code, let's simplify it using Lombok.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.200
Lombok is a very special dependency that minimizes boilerplate code.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.880
So go ahead and add the Lombok dependency if you don't already have it inside of your port XML file.

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.010
I'm pretty sure I provided it in the starter project and if you're using VS code, there's actually

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.420
another step that we need to employ in order to get Lombok working, you need to install the Lombok

6
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.360
annotation support for VS Code Extension.

7
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.100
And now, depending on when you're watching this video, the names of these extensions can change.

8
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.660
So if you see the exact title that I currently have by Microsoft, perfect, install it.

9
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.510
If this title happened to be renamed to, I don't know, Lombok for code, you know, just user intuition.

10
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.660
All right, now it is time for the real fun.

11
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.460
Please pause and get that installed.

12
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.000
And once you do, we're going to go over to the student class.

13
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.220
And let me just tell you this.

14
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.970
You never, ever have to create another getter and setter again.

15
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.590
So over here, up top, what I can just say is add getter.

16
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.350
And etc., and that will automatically generate all of the getters and setters based on the fields that

17
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.660
this class defines.

18
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.120
So here I can remove all of this boilerplate code.

19
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.210
This looks a lot better.

20
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.180
Now, let's just say that I also wanted to have a complete constructor.

21
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.720
So let's create a constructor using all fields.

22
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.900
And let's just say that I also want it to have an empty constructor.

23
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.980
Well, going forward, we do not have to write any of this code again.

24
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.830
If I want Lombok to auto generate a complete constructor for this class, I can just say all args constructor.

25
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.370
If I want Lombok to generate an empty constructor, then I can just say at no ARGs.

26
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.480
Constructor.

27
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.370
All right.

28
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.140
And this is looking really good.

29
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.479
If you don't believe me that this is actually generating constructors, getters and setters on the fly.

30
00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.740
Let's test it out.

31
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.700
I'm going to create a new student object first using the complete constructor.

32
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.630
And there you go.

33
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.580
I'm going to create a new student object using the empty constructor, and this works as well.

34
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.050
I'm going to call one of the getters that Lombok generates.

35
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.540
Now I will call one of the setters.

36
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.300
And this is looking really good.

37
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.820
Never again do we have to write any boilerplate code.

38
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.890
We can just specify the following annotations and let me just import all of these artifacts at once.

39
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.540
And we're going to replicate this for the grade pod class import.

40
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.010
Lombok Star.

41
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.970
Then we'll do the exact same thing for the course of class.

42
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.810
Let us delete all of these getters and setters because they will be auto generated.

43
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.080
We'll delete these getters and setters as well.

44
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.830
Okay.

45
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.860
Looking good.

46
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.430
Now let's just say you also wanted to override equals and hashCode.

47
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.790
Instead you can just use Lombok and say equals and hashCode.

48
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.810
Waiting for it to autocomplete.

49
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.830
And there you go.

50
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.200
But we're not going to be doing that.

51
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.450
Let's just stick with what we have and.

52
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.140
All right.

53
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.000
Let's move on to the next lesson.
