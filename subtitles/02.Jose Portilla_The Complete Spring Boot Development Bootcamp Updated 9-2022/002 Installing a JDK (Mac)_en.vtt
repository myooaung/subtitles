00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.320
A JDK short for Java Development Kit JDK.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.210
And so the name implies that it's something we need to develop Java applications.

3
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.150
Now there are two things you need to run Java code.

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.220
You need a Java compiler to compile your code and a Java runtime to run the compiled code.

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.520
And that's why a JDK provides a compiler, a runtime and a lot of other things.

6
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.680
So in this video, we're going to install a JDK from something called Amazon Coretta.

7
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.030
All right.

8
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.780
Amazon credit is just a distribution which once installed does the work of setting up a JDK in your

9
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.500
computer.

10
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.760
Basically, all you need to do is install it and it's going to do the heavy lifting.

11
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.350
So to start in this lesson, I need you to click the link in the resources.

12
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.860
I'll give you a couple of seconds to pause the video and do that.

13
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.450
The links should take you to the Amazon Credo page.

14
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.330
We're going to start by scrolling down to the Mac platform.

15
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.840
In choosing the first installer.

16
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.820
You can go ahead and pause the video until you're finished downloading it.

17
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.480
All right.

18
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.030
Once you download your installer, go ahead and open it.

19
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.470
And now just go through every step in the installation wizard.

20
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.040
Here you'd put in your computer password?

21
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.270
Nothing too hard.

22
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.570
And it should take a couple of seconds to install.

23
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.750
There you go.

24
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.980
That was pretty quick.

25
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.800
Now you have a JDK installed in your computer.

26
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.620
We can go ahead and move the installer to trash.

27
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.930
Now to make sure we install the JDK, we can check for it.

28
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.200
Namely, we're going to check for a Java compiler and a Java runtime since we know that's what a JDK

29
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.190
is composed of.

30
00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.210
So to check if the installation worked.

31
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.380
Open the terminal from your launchpad or any way you want.

32
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.780
Really?

33
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.660
But just look for the terminal.

34
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.210
Now the first thing we're going to check for is a compiler.

35
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.730
So right.

36
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.850
Java C, which stands for Java compiler.

37
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.130
Dash version.

38
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.490
And press enter.

39
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.370
If a version shows up and it does, for me that means you have a Java compiler.

40
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.410
This shows me how the job of compiler version 11 and now I write Java Dash version.

41
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.230
This checks for a Java runtime.

42
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.470
And once again, since a version shows up for me, this means my computer does have a working Java runtime

43
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.210
thanks to Amazon curto.

44
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.990
And if all goes well, then you're all set up.

45
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.650
And so in this lesson you installed a JDK.

46
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.680
Now your computer can compile and run code.
