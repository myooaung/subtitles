Courtesy of Lombok.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.840
We never have to write auto pilot again.

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.510
If you remember the challenge from the Beans section, if I were to put a constructor here, let me

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.210
just generate a constructor using all fields.

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.800
Then we wouldn't need auto wire because Spring Boot will automatically inject the relevant dependencies

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800
over here and then it's going to update your fields.

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.260
This is useful when you've got many fields and you don't want to keep saying auto wired.

8
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.920
And if I were to test everything out, everything would still work as intended.

9
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.420
So let me just create a grade.

10
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.970
Beautiful.

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.020
Now.

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.100
This is nothing new.

13
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.320
You already saw this in your challenge, but instead of writing out this ugly constructor, we can just

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.610
go up here and say.

15
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.800
All our eggs.

16
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.270
Constructor.

17
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.270
And it will auto generate the constructor on the fly by virtue of just putting all our constructor.

18
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.790
It's going to take care of dependency injection.

19
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.370
Let us just test it out by making one request.

20
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.930
We're still good.

21
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.350
So wherever we're using auto wired, let me just put an all args constructor instead.

22
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.750
So over here.

23
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.260
And we'll probably need it here as well eventually.

24
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.820
So let's just get it over with.

25
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.530
This.

26
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.140
Put it in the great controller.

27
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.060
So don't forget to remove auto wired.

28
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.810
And in the student controller.

29
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.360
We're going to need this here eventually.

30
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.710
So let's just do it right now.

31
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.220
All right, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.

32
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.940
Remove this.

33
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.060
And looks like we're good.

34
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.680
It's nice that now I don't have to keep putting out a wired every single time.

35
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.930
Add another field.

36
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.790
I can just say all args constructor and it's going to perform the dependency injection behind the scenes.
