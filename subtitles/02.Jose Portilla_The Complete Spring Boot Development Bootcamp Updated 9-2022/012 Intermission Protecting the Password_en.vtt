00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.620
All right.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.660
Before we move on, we have to always consider protecting ourselves against potential attackers.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.380
So when a user is saved, we are sending back the entire user entity that includes the ID, the username

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.700
and the password.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.920
Now, sending back the password, although it's encrypted, is still dangerous.

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.810
We're sending them back the algorithm that we use, the number of rounds, the salt, and we're just

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.100
leaving ourselves vulnerable to an attacker that may get this password.

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.250
There is never, ever, ever a good reason to send back the hashed password.

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.610
And I know what you're thinking.

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.770
Hey, why don't we just put JSON ignore?

11
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.030
That's not going to work because JSON ignore affects the serialization and the serialization process

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.690
as well.

13
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.480
So over here, if we do that, we're going to get a password cannot be blank error message.

14
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.850
So that's not going to work.

15
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.960
And you know what?

16
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.930
We could jump through a lot of hoops and only send back the username, but honestly, I don't even see

17
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.580
the point in sending them back.

18
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:10.020
The user that was created a status of created should be enough to confirm to the user that they were

19
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.100
a registered.

20
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.240
All right.

21
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.030
And this looks beautiful to me.

22
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.090
I just wanted to do this before we move on, because it's really important that you never send people's

23
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.620
passwords over the Web.

24
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.830
That was an oversight on my part, but now it's corrected.
