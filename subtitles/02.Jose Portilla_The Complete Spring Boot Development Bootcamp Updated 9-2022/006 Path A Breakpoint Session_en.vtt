00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.000
Breakpoints allow you to visualize the runtime.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.150
They are important for debugging and we use breakpoints of very extensively in the Java bootcamp and

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.510
you can rest assured we're going to use them again in the spring boot course.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.670
If you're not familiar with breakpoints yet, please visit the helpful resources inside of Appendix

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.050
A and watch the breakpoints lesson that corresponds to your editor.

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.920
First thing I'll do is I will add a breakpoint right over here and then run my application in debug

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.490
mode.

8
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.150
All right.

9
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.810
If I scroll up, I can see that the HTTP server is running on Port 8080.

10
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.330
So back here, the client can make a get request to local host 8080 slash.

11
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.910
Hello.

12
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.820
The Handler method intercepts the get request.

13
00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.960
You can see that it reaches the breakpoint and it's going to respond with a view called some HTML view.

14
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.060
If we continue the runtime.

15
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.270
We get an error.

16
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.860
It says the template might not exist or might not be accessible.

17
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.880
So the HTML template that our handler method is trying to return doesn't exist.

18
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.020
So Spring Boot actually just sends back an exception.

19
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.810
Now, there's one thing I want to point out is that when you're doing your challenges or your workbooks,

20
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.540
you're going to come across error messages like this.

21
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.940
My biggest advice is to ignore all the noise.

22
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.460
Look for the meaningful message that describes what your issue is.

23
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.710
In this case, the error was that it could not resolve the template some HTML view.

24
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.650
Don't be discouraged by all of these logs.

25
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.790
Just make sure to look at what's meaningful.

26
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.220
This is really important for debugging and as far as this breakpoint session goes, that's really it.

27
00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.080
It was only to show you how to visualize the runtime of a spring boot app using VS code and the breakpoint

28
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.440
sessions in the future will rest assured be more meaningful.
