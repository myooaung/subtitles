00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.380
A JDK short for Java Development Kit JDC.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.270
And so the name implies that it's something we need to develop Java applications.

3
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.190
Now there are two things you need to run Java code.

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:22.270
You need a Java compiler to compile your code and a Java runtime to run the compiled code.

5
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.570
And that's why a JDC provides a compiler, a runtime and a lot of other things.

6
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.740
So in this video, we're going to install a JDC from something called Amazon Coretta.

7
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.080
All right.

8
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.830
Amazon credit is just a distribution which once installed does the work of setting up a JDK in your

9
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.550
computer.

10
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.810
Basically, all you need to do is install it and it's going to do the heavy lifting.

11
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.370
So to start in this lesson, I need you to click the link in the resources.

12
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.910
I'll give you a couple of seconds to pause the video and do that.

13
00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.920
The link should take you to the Amazon Credo page.

14
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.990
We're going to scroll down to the Windows platform and choose the first installer.

15
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.930
You can go ahead and pause the video until you're finished downloading it.

16
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.960
Once you download your installer, go ahead and open it, then go through every step in the installation

17
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.970
wizard and it should take a few seconds to install.

18
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.850
Just keep going through all the steps.

19
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.550
And that's all.

20
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.040
Now you have a JDK installed in your computer.

21
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.910
Now to make sure we install the JDK, we can check for it.

22
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.220
Namely, we're going to check for a Java compiler and a Java runtime since we know that's what a JDK

23
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.180
is composed of.

24
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.260
We're going to check for a JDK by looking for the command prompt.

25
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.010
And the first thing we're going to check for is a compiler.

26
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.290
So we're going to write Java C, which stands for Java compiler version.

27
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.740
Then we're going to press enter.

28
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.550
If a version shows up, that means you have a Java compiler.

29
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.880
And this shows me I have a Java compiler, version 11.

30
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.050
So now I'm going to write Java version two, check for a job by runtime.

31
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.950
And once again a version shows up for me, which means I have a working java runtime courtesy of Open

32
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.660
JD.com is on Curto.

33
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.790
If for whatever reason you're getting a command not found message, just try to restart your computer

34
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.020
and you should be fine.

35
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.060
And so in this lesson you installed a JDK.

36
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.120
Now your computer can compile and run code.
