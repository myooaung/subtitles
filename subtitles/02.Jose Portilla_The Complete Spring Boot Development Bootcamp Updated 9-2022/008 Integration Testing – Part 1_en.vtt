00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.870
This lesson, you will set up a class that can run integration tests.

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.540
You'll notice that your project comes with a test class that is annotated with spring boot test.

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.230
The Spring Boot Test annotation is for integration testing because integration testing spans the controller,

4
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.180
the repository, the service.

5
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.070
It's going to need beans.

6
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.520
The spring boot test annotation loads the spring container.

7
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.260
It loads the spring context.

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.330
It will scan your entire application for components and register them as beans.

9
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.880
So at this point, the great controller bean lives inside of the spring container, which means we can

10
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.900
auto wire it.

11
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.820
We're going to auto wire.

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.290
The great controller being.

13
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.990
Inside of a controller variable.

14
00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.030
And now after it loads the spring container, after it loads the spring context, this life cycle method

15
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.370
context loads is going to run here.

16
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.910
We can perform a sanity check and verify that the controller is not null was a being actually injected

17
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:17.590
into the following variable so we can say assert that is assert that deprecated.

18
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.490
Interesting.

19
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.570
Never mind.

20
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:27.480
We'll just say assert not null and we will assert that the controller is not null.

21
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.740
A bean was injected into it.

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.320
All right.

23
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.700
I think it worked.

24
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.110
And it did.

25
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.760
Our test passes, we successfully loaded the spring container and then auto wired the controller been.

26
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.880
Now the next step is to configure the mock MVC.

27
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.620
You need mock MVC in order to mock a get or post request against one of your controllers handler methods.

28
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.140
The beauty about to Mark MVC is that you can test how your app handles web requests without running

29
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.670
or deploying your application.

30
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.390
So what you'll do is you will annotate your class with auto configure mock MVC.

31
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.710
And as the name suggests, this is going to auto configure your mock MVC.

32
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.590
In other words, to be more specific, this will register the mock MVC bean inside of the spring container.

33
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.220
It's going to live as an object inside of the spring context, which means we can auto wire the mock

34
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.260
MVC being right here.

35
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.010
We will.

36
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.940
Auto wire.

37
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.280
The Mock MVC bean.

38
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.270
Into the following variable.

39
00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.870
And after the context loads we can verify that the mock MVC bean is not null assert not null mock MVC.

40
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.350
Both assertions pass, which means that both objects are not null and we're off to a really good start.

41
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.850
Now we don't actually need to auto wire the controller bean.

42
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.580
This was just for demonstration purposes, so remove it.

43
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.350
And that's all.

44
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.060
So to recap, you set up a class that can run integration tests.

45
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.920
Spring Boot test starts up the application by loading the spring boot context and scanning for beans.

46
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.200
You also annotated the class with auto configure mock MVC.

47
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.120
This annotation, as the name suggests, auto configure is your mock MVC.

48
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.960
It's going to register the mock MVC bean inside of the spring container, which is subsequently auto

49
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.530
wired, and now we're ready to use mock MVC in order to make mock requests.

50
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.380
So you soon.
