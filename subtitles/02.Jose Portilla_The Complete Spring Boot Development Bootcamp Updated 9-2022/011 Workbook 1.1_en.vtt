Welcome to Workbook 1.1.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.490
In this workbook, you're going to send a request to Google and Google is going to send back a response

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.810
in the form of a web page.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.340
But in this case, you're not going to just write Google.com as you normally would.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.160
You're actually going to write the full IP address with the port.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.390
Hope you're excited.

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.940

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.810
