As Java developers, we only care about the back end logic.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.850
We don't really care about the front end.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.660
The front end is an interface of buttons, text and images all written in HTML and CSS.

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.100
The HTML is something that will already be given to you by a front end developer.

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.190
Your job is to simply manage how it's presented.

6
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.540
That being said, it doesn't hurt to understand just a teensy bit of HTML as you move forward.

7
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.850
And that's why I provided the HTML cheat sheet.

8
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.540
The cheat sheet is just a bunch of bullet points that briefly explain the fundamental HTML elements.

9
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.300
We're going to use this cheat throughout the course.
