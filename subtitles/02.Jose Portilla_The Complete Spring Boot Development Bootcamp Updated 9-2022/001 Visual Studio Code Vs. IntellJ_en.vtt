00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.630
My two favorite development environments for Spring Boot are VS Code and IntelliJ, Eclipse and NetBeans

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.000
are great as well, but these are my top two.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.900
Between these two I prefer vs code and here's why vs code is more lightweight.

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.020
The download is roughly 250 megabytes, whereas IntelliJ is a two gigabyte download vs code.

5
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.840
Being more lightweight makes it a lot faster.

6
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.980
Now IntelliJ comes with a very rich selection of presets and plugins vs code does not support spring

7
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.240
boot development out of the box.

8
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.330
It's very barebones, but it does allow you to add spring boot and Java extensions as needed.

9
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.010
This flexible extension system is what makes VS Code a very light download and allows you to develop

10
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.710
with unparalleled performance and speed.

11
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.760
I prefer vs code but I also totally understand if you want to use IntelliJ.

12
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.740
It boils down to this choose V's code for its speed or choose ontology for its very rich selection of

13
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.150
presets and plugins.

14
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.780
That's why I'm presenting you with two paths.

15
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:21.050
Choose Path A if you want to use VS Code and choose Path B if you want to use IntelliJ, the paths will

16
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.090
merge in the model view controller section and from there I'll be using VS code.

17
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.940
But if you're an intelligent user, not to worry.

18
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.640
If I ever do something in vs code that might be different in IntelliJ there will be two separate lessons

19
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.280
one for Path A and one for Path B.

20
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.310
You just got to choose the one that corresponds to your editor.

21
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.570
So to recap, both vs code and IntelliJ are excellent choices.

22
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.510
Choose Path A if you want to use vs code and choose path B if you want to use IntelliJ.
