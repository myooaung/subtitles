00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.930
The controller makes up one component of the MVC architecture.

2
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.840
The controller responds to web requests by managing the model and presenting the view.

3
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.200
In this lesson, you will create a controller inside Spring Boot.

4
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.610
Spring Boot uses annotations to create magic.

5
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.640
Annotations create the sensation of magic.

6
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.890
They add logic to an application without you having to add any code.

7
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.200
So in the model of the controller section, you will encounter these for annotations.

8
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.790
Controller get mapping, post mapping and request parameters.

9
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.790
Each annotation magically adds functionality to your Spring Boot app.

10
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.810
This annotation converts a class into a controller, as the name suggests.

11
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.580
So when you annotate a class with ADD controller, it becomes the entry point for all web requests.

12
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.260
In turn, the controller class contains handler methods.

13
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.960
A handler method can respond to a web request.

14
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.520
All right.

15
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.390
First thing we're going to do is inside the grade submission folder, create a new file called Grade

16
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.940
Controller Java.

17
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.620
And what we're going to do is annotate the class with ADD controller.

18
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.360
If you don't annotate the class with controller, spring boot will not see this class and nothing inside

19
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.200
is going to run.

20
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.280
Now recall the controller is the entry point for all web requests, and one type of request that it

21
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.050
can handle is get requests.

22
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.070
A get request is when the user is requesting a resource.

23
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.060
In other words, a get request is when the user wants to get a resource from our Spring Boot app.

24
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.560
The user can make a request from the browser.

25
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.040
The URL that they type must specify the host.

26
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.700
The port.

27
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.990
And the path.

28
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.000
So in the last section, you were actually making get requests the entire time.

29
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.970
The Host and port will send the request to the Spring Boot app.

30
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.000
Once their request reaches the app, the controller is its entry point.

31
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.180
The controller uses the path portion of a request to decide which handler method to run.

32
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.830
The handler method responds by returning a resource.

33
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.150
In this case, it's some type of HTML.

34
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.770
All right.

35
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.810
The next annotation is get mapping.

36
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.550
This annotation magically converts a method into a handler method.

37
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.970
The handler method can respond to get requests.

38
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.200
When you annotate a method with get mapping, it can respond to a get request.

39
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.930
The get mapping annotation receives one argument a path.

40
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.140
This method can respond to get requests made on the path.

41
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.820
Hello.

42
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.930
So inside grade controller java create a method called say hello that returns a string.

43
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.700
Public string say hello.

44
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.080
And the string is going to return is some HTML view.

45
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.590
For the time being.

46
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.100
And now we'll give the method the get mapping annotation.

47
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.930
Wait for autocomplete to show, get mapping, click on it.

48
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.140
And you can see that at auto imports.

49
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.180
And now we want to make sure that this method responds to get requests made on the path.

50
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.350
Hello.

51
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.840
You can go ahead and run your spring boot application.

52
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.750
And then from your browser make a request to local host 8080 slash.

53
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.290
Hello.

54
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.420
And we get an error code.

55
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.200
The user makes a request on the path slash.

56
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.910
Hello.

57
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.180
The controller maps the request to a handler method that matches the path.

58
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.250
The handler method tries responding with a view called some HTML view.

59
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.210
What it does is it actually looks inside the templates folder.

60
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.810
It can't find anything, so it returns an error code.

61
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.650
The controller is the entry point for all web requests.

62
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.970
Once the request reaches the app, the controller is its entry point.

63
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.090
The controller uses the path portion of a request to decide which handler method to run.

64
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.460
The Handler method is the one that responds to the get request.
