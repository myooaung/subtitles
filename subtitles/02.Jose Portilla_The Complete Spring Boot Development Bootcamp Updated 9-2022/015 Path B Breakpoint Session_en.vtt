00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.740
In this breakpoint session.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.550
We're going to start by adding breakpoints inside of get grades.

3
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:08.770
All right.

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.620
And now go ahead and press the debug button.

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.490
We'll wait for the Tomcat server to load and run on Port 88.

6
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.540
All right.

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.500
I will make a get request on local host 88 with path grades.

8
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.090
The Handler method get grades, intercepts, the get request.

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.400
You can see that the method has direct access to the model.

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.170
The model right now is empty.

11
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.340
There's nothing inside of it.

12
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.080
It has a size of zero.

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.150
So we need to give it some data, which is exactly what we're going to do in the next two lines.

14
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:57.600
So I'll step over this breakpoint and this line creates a plain old Java object with a name, score

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.560
and subject.

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.379
And then here we're adding a model attribute where a grade key maps to that grade object.

17
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.410
All right.

18
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.650
The model gets populated with data.

19
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.580
You can click here to expand and you'll notice a key value pair.

20
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.910
The key grade maps to a grade object.
