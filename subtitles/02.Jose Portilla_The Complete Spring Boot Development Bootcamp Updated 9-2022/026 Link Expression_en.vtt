00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.719
Another type of family expression is the link expression.

2
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.890
A variable expression executes on a model attribute in some way.

3
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.510
After binding an object, a selection expression can select one of its fields.

4
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.070
And a link expression specifies a URL endpoint or a path to a resource.

5
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.960
In this lesson, you will use a link expression.

6
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.450
The stylesheet is going to contain all of your CSS.

7
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.280
The stylesheet contains all of your CSS code and as we slowly start templating using, finally the CSS

8
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.990
code really stands in the way.

9
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.290
The purpose of CSS is to style your web page, but as backend developers, we don't really care about

10
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.750
styling font sizes or colors.

11
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.500
CSS falls within the realm of a front end developer's job.

12
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.440
And if you recall, the static folder is a folder that contains static web content such as images,

13
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.480
logos, and in this case it's going to contain some CSS files.

14
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.830
So inside static, what we're going to do is create two style sheets, one for the grades page that

15
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.090
I'm going to call grades style sheet, dot CSS.

16
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.130
And I will create another stylesheet for the form form stylesheet dot CSS.

17
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.030
And now what I can do is remove all of the CSS code from the forum page.

18
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.690
I can remove the following element and paste it inside a form stylesheet.

19
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.930
And I will do the same thing for the grades.

20
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.830
HTML.

21
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.880
CSS.

22
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.200
Remove all of this.

23
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.820
Remove the style element.

24
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.530
And place it inside of grade style sheet.

25
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.420
Now, if I were to actually run the application, I don't know why I stopped it.

26
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.180
If you view the app.

27
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.230
An application looks pretty ugly without any success.

28
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.280
So what we need to do is, quote unquote link each timely template to its respective stylesheet.

29
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.480
And if you were to take a look at the HTML cheat sheet, I will scroll to the link tag.

30
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.550
What this does is it links the current document to an external resource and the belief a ref attribute

31
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.690
when used inside of a link element.

32
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:07.570
What it's going to do is look inside the static folder for an external resource and it uses a link expression

33
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.590
to specify a path to that resource, and REL specifies a relationship between the document and the external

34
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.320
resource.

35
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.400
In this case, the relationship is going to be stylesheet.

36
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.110
So what I'm going to do is in accordance with the.

37
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.640
A cheat sheet, I'll create a link element.

38
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:41.190
We will use the final leaf attribute h ref and we're going to set it equal to a link expression, which

39
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.650
is an add symbol followed by brackets.

40
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.350
And here you would specify usually either a URL endpoint or a path to a resource.

41
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.470
Given this context, we're specifying a path to a resource.

42
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.030
The path is going to automatically start at static.

43
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.120
So we can just say here, grades, stylesheet, CSS.

44
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.510
And now if I were to refresh.

45
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.720
Oh, I forgot to specify their relationship, which is stylesheet.

46
00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.579
This was also in our cheat sheet.

47
00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.350
So now if I were to go back.

48
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.690
And beautiful.

49
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.100
It successfully applies CSS styling to our HTML web page.

50
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.430
We don't have a handler method set up for the form web page just yet, but that's not stopping us from

51
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.770
just taking care of that right now for later.

52
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:44.060
So we will link this HTML document to the form stylesheet using our link expression.

53
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.410
Nice.

54
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:53.090
Now you'll notice the link expression no matter what it specifies a URL endpoint or a path, and that's

55
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.400
totally dependent on how you're using it.

56
00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.790
So if it's used in tandem with a final leaf action attribute, then it's going to be a URL endpoint.

57
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.400
Just for example, if it's used inside of an anchor tag, then it's also going to be a URL endpoint.

58
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.710
In this case, we're specifying a path, so it really just depends on the context.

59
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.600
To recap, you linked each HTML template to a stylesheet.

60
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.600
You have now looked at three types of family expressions.

61
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.720
There is the variable expression which executes on your model attribute in some way the selection expression,

62
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.070
which works in the sense that after binding an object, you can select one of its fields.

63
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:41.320
And the link expression is a an expression that specifies a URL, end point or a path to a resource.

64
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.260
That's really it.
