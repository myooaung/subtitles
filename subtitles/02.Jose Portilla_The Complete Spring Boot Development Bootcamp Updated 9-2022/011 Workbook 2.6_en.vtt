00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.340
Welcome to Workbook 2.6.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.790
I already went ahead and launched the Starter Project.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.880
Task one is inside the Handler method.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.650
We need to add two pieces of data to our model.

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.060
Let's go ahead and do just that.

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.180
All right.

7
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.320
And then here it's saying if the entry budget is greater than or equal to 5000, then blah blah blah

8
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.950
blah blah.

9
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.360
Otherwise display.

10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.990
Sorry, we don't have any cars below 5000.

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.250
So let's start with the F and on less.

12
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.770
We'll create one div, one empty container.

13
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.170
And this dev is going to render if and only if we're going to grab the.

14
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.740
We're going to grab the budget.

15
00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.270
If that budget is greater than or equal to 5000, then disruptive is going to render what's going to

16
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.410
be inside this div.

17
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.310
I have no idea.

18
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.140
Let's just add another diff for now.

19
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.010
And otherwise, if their budget is lower than 5000, let's just copy this.

20
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.310
Then what do we want to tell them?

21
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.190
We want to just say sorry we don't have any cars below 5000.

22
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.160
So here we can just add a paragraph tag.

23
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.380
That says, sorry, we don't have cars below 5000.

24
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.720
Okay.

25
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.110
So we're already done this part.

26
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.500
Now let's finish up this part.

27
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.170
If the budget is bigger than or equal to 5000, what do we do?

28
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.050
Then compare the enter to make against five cases and the case match is going to be displayed.

29
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.440
Hope this made you think of the switch expression.

30
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.680
So here we can add another div.

31
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.640
So if the budget is greater than 5000, this will render.

32
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.680
Now we're here and this is going to determine which paragraph tag renders depending on which one has

33
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.720
a case match.

34
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.460
So we're going to grab the make.

35
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.370
And we're going to compare it.

36
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.970
We're going to compare it against five possible cases.

37
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.090
First.

38
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.370
This will render if the make equals Toyota.

39
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.460
Which is the car that I drive.

40
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.390
Okay.

41
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.370
So the different possible cases are Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford, Honda, and then default.

42
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.710
So we'll say Toyota.

43
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.610
Volkswagen.

44
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.740
Ford.

45
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.770
And Honda.

46
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.080
And this was the default case if it doesn't match any of them.

47
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.250
And then if it's at Toyota, I believe it said, to display a Toyota Corolla, $5,000.

48
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.950
Otherwise, let's just copy them over.

49
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.630
Volkswagen Jetta 6000.

50
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.150
Ford Escape 7000.

51
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.490
Honda Civic 8000.

52
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.760
Otherwise, no cars match or query.

53
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.180
So this was your first nested conditional and final leaf, and I hope it wasn't too hard.

54
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.860
The trick was the first only focus on your F and on lessons.

55
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.620
And then once that was out of the way, assume the F expression was the one that executed this diff

56
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.250
would render.

57
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.390
So your next focus would be to determine what render is inside of this container by comparing the make

58
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.700
against five possible cases.

59
00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.140
All right.

60
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.640
Think that's it?

61
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.010
We should be ready to run our code.

62
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.350
I'll spin up a new terminal.

63
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.020
You're run the application.

64
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.320
We'll say a local host, Eddie Ating.

65
00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.870
I'm just going to zoom in.

66
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.460
And it says, sorry, we don't have any cars below 5000.

67
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.500
Let me go back to my workbook controller.

68
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.670
I'll say 8000 and I'm looking for a Toyota.

69
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.910
What will we get?

70
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.040
Toyota Corolla for 5000.

71
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.800
Beautiful.

72
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.770
I'll go and say Volkswagen.

73
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.990
Volkswagen.

74
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.480
And there is a Volkswagen Jetta available for 6000.

75
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.190
That is all for workbook 2.6.

76
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.250
I will see you in the next one.
