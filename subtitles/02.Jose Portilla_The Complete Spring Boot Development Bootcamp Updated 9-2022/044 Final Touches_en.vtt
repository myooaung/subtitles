00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.540
In this lesson, you will add some final touches.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.990
The constant -1000 is meaningful.

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.200
Instead of writing -1000 every single time, which is a very good way to get bugs.

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.800
We need to define it as a constant and describe its purpose.

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.130
And inside this folder I will create a constant Java file.

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.820
And now here I will declare a public static final.

7
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.950
And.

8
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.870
Equal to -1000.

9
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.220
Final means the constant can never be mutated, and static means you can access the constant without

10
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.440
creating an object of this class.

11
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.580
This was already explained in the Complete Java Development Bootcamp.

12
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.010
In any case, what I'm going to do here.

13
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.750
Is replace the loose number a -1000 with a final constant constants.

14
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.420
And we'll do the same thing all over.

15
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.290
Next thing we're going to do is fix the following anchor tags, form and grades.

16
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.550
Because right now the form and grades, buttons, they don't really lead to anything.

17
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.570
They must be able to make get requests.

18
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.360
So what I'm going to do is give each one of them a thin leaf, a rough attribute, as we did for the

19
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.000
update button file leaf h ref.

20
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.150
Finally h ref.

21
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.320
The first one will make a get request to the relative path slash.

22
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.570
The second one will make a get request to the relative path slash grades.

23
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.810
Which, as you know, will return the grade's view OC.

24
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.100
Now, if I'm inside of the forms page, these buttons should work perfectly.

25
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.300
But inside of the grade's view, these buttons don't actually work because I'm going to have to go inside

26
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.110
a grade XHTML and apply the same changes.

27
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.620
All right.

28
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.800
Now the app is fully functional.

29
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.410
You can submit a grade.

30
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.630
You can update that same grade.

31
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.450
And then if you want to add a new grade, instead of writing out local host 8080 all over again, press

32
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.310
a button that makes it get request to that same path and you can add a new grade.

33
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.810
We'll say her mini.

34
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.250
A-plus arithmetic.

35
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.810
Beautiful.

36
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.070
And actually, on the topic of final touches, one last thing I want to do is I don't like that we're

37
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.470
calling this function twice.

38
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.290
So what I'll say is int.

39
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.980
Index is equal to get grade index at that ID.

40
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.780
And then we'll just pass in the index making this line a lot shorter.

41
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.170
Student grades get index.

42
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.270
And that's it.
