00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.050
The Spring boot devtools dependency accelerates development time.

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.130
I like to use the MAVEN Clean Command at least once to start from a fresh build.

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.860
And then I rely on the spring boot devtools dependency to auto restart the application every time I

4
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.090
make a new change.

5
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.030
So in this lesson we will add the spring boot devtools dependency.

6
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.650
Spring Boot DevTools instruments your application to pick up new changes and restart.

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.680
So what we're going to do is Google Spring Boot Def Tools.

8
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.860
And we will go to the.

9
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.660
No, let's be more specific.

10
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.670
We'll say central maven repo.

11
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.810
Go to the Central Maven repository.

12
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.200
I will choose version 2.6.7 in accordance with my spring boot project.

13
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.519
Click that.

14
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.290
Now here.

15
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.480
I can add the dependency.

16
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.070
Now I can actually remove the version number.

17
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.790
That being said, the version for Spring Boot starters will be 2.6.7 by default.

18
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.460
And what this dependency will do is provide all of the files needed to instrument your application to

19
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.010
always restart when you make a new change.

20
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.330
So let's try it out.

21
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.490
I'll start off with a clean build maven.

22
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.350
Clean spring boots run.

23
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.290
All right.

24
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.290
This time I actually have my Tomcat server running on Port 8080, so I'll go ahead and make a request

25
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.800
there.

26
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.630
Local host, 8080.

27
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.130
Spring.

28
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.160
All right.

29
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.020
And now if you focus on my terminal, if I ever make a change in the back end for now, I'll just add

30
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.160
a print statement.

31
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.350
Notice that it auto restarts.

32
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.880
That's pretty cool, but we don't need to make any changes in the back end right now.

33
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.370
We'll go right into The View and I'll add another header that says.

34
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.540
How are you?

35
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.650
And now I don't have to restart the application because when we make a request on local hosts 80 to

36
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.480
80, it's going to return the updated view.

37
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.880
Beautiful.

38
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.420
So to recap, you added the devtools dependency that picks up new changes and restart your application.

39
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.550
Every now and then.

40
00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.100
I like to start off with a fresh build using Maven clean spring boot to run and then I let DevTools

41
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.330
take care of the rest.
