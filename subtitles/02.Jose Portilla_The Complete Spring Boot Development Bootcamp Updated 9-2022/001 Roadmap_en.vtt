In this section, you will secure your API using basic authentication.

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.280
Basic authentication involves the user sending over their username and password everything they need

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.870
to invoke an operation.

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.660
Now this method of authentication is not safe, it's not recommended and should rarely ever be used

5
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.740
in real life.

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.490
But we will start by implementing basic auth because as the name implies, it's basic and it will allow

7
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.420
us to get familiar with spring security as well as filter chains.

8
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.800
And due to popular demand in Workbook 10.1, you will connect your grade submission API to a database

9
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.080
that's managed by my SQL.

10
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.940
And finally, we will implement the recommended and the popular token based authentication where the

11
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.780
client will authenticate using a JWT token.

12
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.260
Authenticating using a JWT token is much more secure because the payload doesn't contain any sensitive

13
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.160
data and its digital signature is encoded in such a way that is almost impossible to decode.

14
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.060
The section is very exciting and I cannot wait to share it with you.
