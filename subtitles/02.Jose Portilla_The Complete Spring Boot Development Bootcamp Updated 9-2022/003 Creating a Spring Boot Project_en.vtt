00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.680
Spring Boot is the best Java framework for developing web applications.

2
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.120
In this lesson, you're going to create a spring boot project.

3
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.030
The Spring initialize generates a spring boot project.

4
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.440
You can access the spring initialization by going to start dot spring dot IO.

5
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.910
Please pause the video and go to this website.

6
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.430
Now.

7
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.830
IntelliJ also has a spring initialized plugin that you can feel free to look into, but between the

8
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.750
two, I prefer the websites.

9
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.420
As of this recording, the stable version of Spring Boot is 2.6.7.

10
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.440
The versions will be different depending on when you're watching this video.

11
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.930
Just make sure to choose a stable version.

12
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.710
In other words, a version that doesn't precede parentheses.

13
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.210
And the group ID identifies the organization creating the project.

14
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.460
Your group ID should be a fully qualified domain name.

15
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.600
It should include a domain extension like dot com, dot org dot net, followed by the name of the organization.

16
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.580
For this tutorial, I'm going to create a group ID of comm dot l tp four learn the part.

17
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.660
The artifact ID determines the name of your application.

18
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.710
I'm going to call the application.

19
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.080
Hello, Spring.

20
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.460
We will stick with the default jar packaging type.

21
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.060
We're going to discuss packaging in more detail in an upcoming workbook.

22
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.479
I have Java 11 installed, so make sure to choose a Java version that matches the one you have installed.

23
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.780
Dependency is software that your application depends on.

24
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.900
We will discuss dependencies in more detail soon enough.

25
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.820
For now, you don't need to add any dependencies, so simply generate your project.

26
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.850
And it's going to generate into your downloads folder.

27
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.570
I'm going to extract the contents of my zip file.

28
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.180
And move it to desktop.

29
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.420
You can move it to the folder of your choice.

30
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.660
It doesn't really matter.

31
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.470
Now I'm going to go to IntelliJ.

32
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.670
Click on file.

33
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.790
And I will open.

34
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.510
The Halo Spring Project.

35
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.180
To recap, you created a spring boot project using the spring and nebulizer.

36
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.190
Recall that group ID identifies the organization creating the project.

37
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.120
It should be a fully qualified domain name that's completely lowercase.

38
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.910
Artifact ID is the name of your application, and every word that follows is joined by a hyphen.

39
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.510
Always choose jar as the file type to package your application, and a dependency is software that your

40
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.070
application depends on.
