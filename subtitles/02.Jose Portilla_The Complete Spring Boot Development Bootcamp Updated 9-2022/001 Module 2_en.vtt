1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.740
Time to start to module two.

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.400
Spring Boot really shines in the creation of Web services.

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.190
A web service operates on some kind of database in some way, and then what it's going to do is share

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.980
a data with a front end application by sending over data packets in the form of JSON or XML.

5
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.220
And module two of this course is going to focus on the back end portion of web development.

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.330
We will be creating all sorts of Web services and APIs, which is where Spring Boot really shines.

7
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.800
You will master the art of creating a robust back end.
