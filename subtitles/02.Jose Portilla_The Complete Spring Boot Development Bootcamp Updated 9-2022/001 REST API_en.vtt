00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.230
Rest is a set of guidelines that are used to develop APIs.

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.730
An API mediates the interaction of a consumer and a system.

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.400
A rest API is just an API that conforms to a set of guidelines.

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.650
In this lesson, you will learn about rest APIs.

5
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.450
Let's start with a very broad definition of an API.

6
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.440
It is simply a mediator between a consumer and a system.

7
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.159
Imagine that you have a consumer that needs content.

8
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:38.800
The API, what it's going to do is read the consumer's request and if it's valid, it acts as a mediator

9
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.870
by grabbing content from another system and then it produces a response.

10
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.030
No arrests.

11
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.200
API is an API that conforms to a set of guidelines.

12
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.790
First of all, arrest the revolves around the concept of resources.

13
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.870
A resource usually implies a piece of data that you can name.

14
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.280
Examples include employees, contacts, movies or products.

15
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.900
Here.

16
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.090
A database stores a bunch of contacts, and each contact is considered a resource.

17
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.760
Now, if a consumer wants to access a resource, they need to specify a.

18
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.090
U.

19
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.320
R.

20
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.900
I.

21
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.460
The Urry.

22
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.350
The Uniform Resource Identifier identifies the location of a resource.

23
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.240
The following Yuri identifies the location of the contact resource.

24
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.490
John Snow.

25
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:57.380
Also a rest API should define operations that can manipulate resources, get to retrieve a resource

26
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.840
post, creates a resource, put updates a resource and delete.

27
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.310
Deletes a resource.

28
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.610
If a user wants to delete a resource, they need to make a delete request.

29
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.120
The Urry identifies the resource to be deleted.

30
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.810
The API defines an operation that is capable of deleting the resource.

31
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.020
It can use the information provided by the URI to delete the resource in question.

32
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.870
The resource is most often represented using JSON.

33
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.370
If a user wants to access a resource, they will make a get request.

34
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.420
The URI identifies the resource to be accessed.

35
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.070
The API defines an operation that is capable of accessing the resource.

36
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.590
It can use the information provided by the URI to access the resource in question.

37
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.650
And it's going to serialize the data into JSON before sending it back.

38
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.920
JSON represents the data in the form of key value pairs.

39
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.150
A collection is a grouping of resources.

40
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.600
If the user wants to access all of the contacts, they would specify a Yuri and point that requests

41
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.860
all of the contacts.

42
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.010
The API would define an operation that is capable of accessing a collection of contacts, and what it's

43
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.150
going to do is send back the collection in JSON format once again.

44
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.310
When it comes to collections, the JSON starts with a square bracket such that each contact is limited

45
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.420
by a comma.

46
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.470
Perfect.

47
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.960
Let's start putting all of this into practice.
