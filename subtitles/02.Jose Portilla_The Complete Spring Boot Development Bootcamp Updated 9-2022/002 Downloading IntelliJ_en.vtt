00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.080
If you're watching this video, then you chose to follow this course using IntelliJ.

2
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.820
So in this video, we're going to download the intelligence community edition.

3
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.310
You can download Intel for Mac, Windows or Linux.

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.770
I left you a link in the resources folder.

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.440
The resources folder is just a small icon that you'll find close to the lecture title.

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.690
So take a second to pause the video and we will continue.

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.760
Once you're on the download page.

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.830
Download it for whatever operating system you're using.

9
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.550
There's only one download link for Windows, but there is two for Mac.

10
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.410
In that case, what you want to do is go to about this Mac.

11
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.900
And if your chip says Intel, then you would choose the Mac Intel installer.

12
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.739
Mine says AM one, so I'll choose the other installer.

13
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.850
The Ultimate Edition has many extra features for enterprise development that we do not need for this

14
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.570
course.

15
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.340
The community edition has everything that we need, minus all of the bells and whistles.

16
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.940
Okay.

17
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.400
Our download is finished.

18
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.740
And I'm good to go.

19
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.840
Open up IntelliJ.

20
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.550
You can feel free to customize your theme.

21
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.110
I'm going to stick with Mac OS Lite.

22
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.220
I'm going to choose an ID font of 16.

23
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.330
And as far as plug ins go, we're not going to add any more plug ins than what we've already been provided.

24
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.340
And that's really it.

25
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.550
You download it IntelliJ and now we can start using it.
