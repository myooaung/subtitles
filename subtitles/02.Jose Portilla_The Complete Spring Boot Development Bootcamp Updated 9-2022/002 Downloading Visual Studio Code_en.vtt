00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.270
If you're watching this video, then you chose to follow this course using VS code.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.670
So in this lesson we're going to download vs code as well as the Java extension pack.

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.480
If you want to download the code for Mac, Windows or Linux, I left you a link in the resources folder.

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.480
The resources folder is a small icon that you'll find close to the lecture title, so take a second

5
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.960
to pause the video and we will resume once you're on the download page.

6
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.430
Okay.

7
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.630
So download vs code for whatever operating system you're using.

8
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.860
I'm using a mac, so I'll choose this link.

9
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.550
And the download should not take very long.

10
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.350
VS code is very light.

11
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.180
Few seconds left.

12
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.820
All right, once your download is finished, you can go ahead and unzip the package and open it.

13
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.690
Now we're going to be writing a lot of Java code.

14
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.490
So if you want support for testing, debugging, autocomplete, the first thing we're going to do is

15
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.830
download the Java extension pack.

16
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.320
So go to the extensions tab.

17
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.260
In right java ext pack and download the extension pack for java.

18
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.420
I already have it enabled and installed, so I'll give you a couple of seconds for you to do that and

19
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.380
then we can resume.

20
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.730
Okay.

21
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.440
That's really it.

22
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.300
You downloaded vs code and now we can start using it.
