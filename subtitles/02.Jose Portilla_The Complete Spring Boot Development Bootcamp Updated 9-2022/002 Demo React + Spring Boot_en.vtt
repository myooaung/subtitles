00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.650
In this lesson, we'll connect a react front end to a spring boot back end.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.880
Go to your spring boot boot camp resources and if you don't see the React Spring folder, then please

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.370
download the updated resources from GitHub.

4
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.920
And then launch two instances of VS code.

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.500
One instance is going to launch the React front end and the other is going to launch the spring boot

6
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.640
to back end.

7
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.060
So here is our spring boot to back end.

8
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.370
Don't worry about these annotations right now.

9
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.980
We will cover them in the rest API section.

10
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.070
Just know that this is our back end.

11
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:48.110
And when a user makes a request on localhost 88 slash grades, what it's going to do is send back a

12
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.850
list of grades that is serialized into JSON data.

13
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.420
So let's go ahead and run our spring boot back end.

14
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.020
Now, don't worry about what JSON means right now.

15
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.990
We will also cover that in the rest API section.

16
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.970
But just know that JSON is how we can transmit data from one system to another.

17
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.250
So here if I make a request to local host 8080 slash grades.

18
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.810
And here we see Jason, where each object was serialized into a bunch of key value pairs and each set

19
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.290
of key value pairs is delimited by a comma.

20
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.950
So this is JSON.

21
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.780
And JSON is the most popular way of transmitting data to a consumer.

22
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.830
In this case, the consumer is the react front end.

23
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.460
The React front end if we take a look at the code now because this is JavaScript and we don't really

24
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.330
care about frontend development.

25
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.620
The focus of this course will be back end developments.

26
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.810
I'm not going to go into too much detail.

27
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.730
We don't care about JavaScript in this course, but ultimately this is the consumer.

28
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.430
This front end is going to make requests to our spring boot back and it's going to make a request to

29
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.520
local hosts 88 slash grades.

30
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.100
Our back end is going to send back all of this JSON and this JSON data we're going to use to update

31
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.870
the state of the React application, which means over here, what we can do is loop through all of this

32
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.100
JSON data in order to generate the rows and populate this table, which is eventually going to be rendered

33
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.020
by our React application.

34
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.730
So ultimately, this React app makes a request to our spring boot to back end the spring boot.

35
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.900
Back end sends back a bunch of JSON data and we use that JSON data to populate our view, which is eventually

36
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.940
going to be sent back to the client.

37
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.020
Now, in order to run this React application, the first thing you have to do is say NPM install, and

38
00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.430
I'm getting ahead of myself because in order to run this React app, you need to have Node.js installed.

39
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.070
I left this link inside of your resources folder.

40
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.820
Okay.

41
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.780
Once you do.

42
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.110
First thing you gotta say is npm install to install our node modules.

43
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.930
And now ignoring all these deprecation messages, I'll just say end PM, start again.

44
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.950
We just want it to run.

45
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.740
We don't really care about the latest version or anything.

46
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.290
All right.

47
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.190
And this frontend can be accessed on local host 3000 and notice our table gets populated with data that

48
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.340
was released from our spring boot back end.

49
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.170
This is really, really cool.

50
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.940
So the client is making a request to our react front end.

51
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.860
This is the client, our browser and the front end.

52
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.690
What it's going to do is make another request to our back end.

53
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.990
The back end sends back the JSON and it uses that JSON to populate the table with data.

54
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.590
This is how the lifecycle of a request should be.

55
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.019
There are three entities the client, the front end, the back end module.

56
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.840
Two of this course will purely focus on the back end portion of web development.

57
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.570
We will be creating all sorts of web services and APIs, which is where Spring Butcher really shines.

58
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.410
You will master the art of creating a robust back end.

59
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.690
And I cannot wait to see you there.
