00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.000
The only two things I consider worth customizing are the terminal font size, as well as the ability

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.880
to scroll in and out in order to zoom in.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.560
So if you're using windows, go to file than settings.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.010
I'm using a mac, so I'll go to IntelliJ, followed by preferences.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.260
And the first thing you want to check is change font size with command mouse wheel.

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.870
If you're using windows, it may be this might say something else, but anyways, select the option

7
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:34.410
under mouse control so that you can zoom in and out of your file and going back.

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.220
The next thing you want to adjust is the font.

9
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.440
So right now my terminal has a font size of 25.

10
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.010
If you're starting off your default, font size should be something like 14 or 12, which I think is

11
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.820
too small.

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.070
So choose a size that works for you.

13
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.680
I'm going to go with 17.

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.950
I think that's the perfect size.

15
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.730
One more thing you can adjust is the appearance of your editor.

16
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.040
I like to use Mac OS lite.

17
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.160
If you want to use another color theme, by all means, feel free to experiment with them.

18
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.410
Here you can see I have the material UI themes, which is something you have to install.

19
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.280
So if you want access to more cool themes, go on, get more themes.

20
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.810
If you want material UI themes specifically go on material UI and install it accordingly.

21
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.000
But if you were to go back to get more themes, you can scroll through each one and look at the preview,

22
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.110
see which one you like and install.

23
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.750
Anyways, I don't really care too much about themes.

24
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.290
Just make sure you just make sure you enable changing the font size using your mouse and you give your

25
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.270
terminal a nice big font.
