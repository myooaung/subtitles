A bean is an object, nothing more.

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.120
A bean is an object that springs, stores and manages for you.

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.740
In this lesson, you will learn what a bean is.

4
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.720
Let's go over the most common way of creating a been.

5
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.370
A component class is automatically discovered by spring boot.

6
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.020
When you run a spring boot application, it does three things.

7
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.590
One of them is a component scan.

8
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.270
That is, it scans your project for component classes and so any class annotated with component is automatically

9
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.080
discovered.

10
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.460
Spring Boots creates an object out of each component class that it finds.

11
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.200
A spring container also called the application context stores and manages the object for you.

12
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.500
The object lives inside of the spring container.

13
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.470
And that being said, an object that lives inside the sprint container is called a bean.

14
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.370
The spring container stores and manages the object for you.

15
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.570
To recap, you learned what a bean is.

16
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.110
A bean is an object that lives inside of the spring container, also known as the application context.

17
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.350
The spring container manages the object for you.
