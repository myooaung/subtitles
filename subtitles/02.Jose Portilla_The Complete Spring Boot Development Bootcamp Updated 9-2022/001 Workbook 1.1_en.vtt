00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.340
This video will cover the solution for a workbook.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.400
1.1.

3
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.360
Your first task was to ping google.com.

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.370
So back to your if you're using a mac to your terminal, if you're using Windows, your PowerShell or

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.210
command prompt, we're going to ping google.com.

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.720
And what the ping command does is it continuously sends packets of data to a specific IP address.

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.570
And then it tells you how long it took for that data to transmit.

8
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.120
But the purpose of this workbook is to retrieve an IP address that identifies one of Google's servers

9
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.670
and use it to make an HTTP request.

10
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.870
So if we go back to task two, it tells you that that server can listen to HTTP requests made on Port

11
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.410
80.

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.460
So if we go back here, specify the IP address followed by the port where that server is listening.

13
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.520
And it makes a request to Google.

14
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.980
Google sends back a response in the form of a Web page.

15
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.050
And it's worth noting that in real life, no one ever writes the full address.

16
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.870
What you would do is write something like Google.com, Google, Dot, and behind the scenes a DNS server

17
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.150
is going to map this URL to an address.
