00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.020
Welcome to work.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.009
Book 1.3.

3
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.920
Your first task was to open up the starter workbook.

4
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.470
So what you would have had to do is go to your spring boot to boot camp resources, go to the intro

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.790
to Spring Boot Section.

6
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.860
Whether using Intel JVs code doesn't matter, go to Workbook 1.3 starter and open up the starter workbook

7
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.150
as I already did.

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.420
And here it tells us about the MAVEN Package Command, which compiles your code into Target, and then

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.230
it's going to package all of the compiled code inside of a jar file.

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.650
The name of your jar file is determined by what you specify inside of your pom xml.

11
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.430
So here the name of our jar file is going to be workbook followed by the version number dot Jar Snapshot

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.900
refers to something that you're packaging, but it's still under development.

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.500
For our purposes, we're going to assume that our workbook application is stable, it's done and it's

14
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.820
ready to be released.

15
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.300
So we'll remove Snapshot and we'll just say this is version 0.0.0.1 of our app.

16
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.590
We'll spin up a new terminal and we will package our application into a jar.

17
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.280
This is the first time I'm running it, so I'll have to actually write it out.

18
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.850
Maven Rapper Package compiles all of our classes and then it's going to package all of the compiled

19
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.710
code into a jar.

20
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.080
Here we can see our Jar File workbook, followed by the version that we specified inside of XML.

21
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.560
This chart file contains all of our application's code, and now our application is portable.

22
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.850
So what I can actually do is reveal in Finder if you're using a windows, I believe it's called reveal

23
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.340
in file explorer anyways.

24
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.140
What I'm going to do is grab this jar file and place it inside of my desktop.

25
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.870
Okay.

26
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.050
Next task is to actually run the jar file.

27
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.480
So I'm using a mac.

28
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.960
I'll launch a new terminal.

29
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.110
If you're using Windows, select the command prompt.

30
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.170
I will open up a new terminal.

31
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.580
Now the terminal by default, it's going to point to your route directory.

32
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.830
If for some reason it isn't, enter the command CD which stands for a change directory.

33
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.520
If you don't follow it up with anything, it's going to go to your route directory.

34
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.260
And what's followed by the route directory is your desktop.

35
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.610
So now I can say CD desktop.

36
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.610
Our terminal now points to the desktop directory where I can run my jar file here.

37
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.860
I can say Java Jar and I'm going to run the workbook jar.

38
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.500
All right.

39
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.270
And this jar contained our code.

40
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.030
We can see that it contained an embedded HTTP server that is now running on Port 1990.

41
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.110
So I can go back here, make a request on port in 1990, and the embedded HTTP server that's listening

42
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.230
on that port is going to return a response.

43
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.190
Beautiful.

44
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.170
All right.

45
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.430
I think that's about it.

46
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.070
Now, if you're using Windows and it says desktop directory not found as you run this command, then

47
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.310
chances are that your command prompt wasn't pointing to your C drive to begin with.

48
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.900
So you're going to have to specify the whole path by saying CD, start from C, drive your home directory,

49
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.230
slash your whatever your username is, which you can autocomplete using tab slash desktop.

50
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.430
If you try that, then make sure that your command prompt is pointing to desktop before you run the

51
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.100
ensuing Java Jar Command.

52
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.970
All right.

53
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.620
I hope you enjoyed this solution.

54
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.630
I'll see you in the next workbook.
