00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.020
Welcome to Workbook 2.4 in this workbook.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.900
Instead of using time off and on less to conditionally render an image, we're going to use a ternary

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.830
operation.

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.480
So here what we can do is remove the second expression.

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.020
And so what we can do is conditionally assign a value for source depending on what the speed is.

6
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.870
So here we can say, well, since the value four source will be the result of a timely expression,

7
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:35.910
we can say Finally source and the leaf expression will start by grabbing the speed.

8
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.160
And comparing it to a speed of 60.

9
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.540
If it's higher than 60.

10
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.330
Then the sauce is going to equal the following string.

11
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.410
If it's lower than 60, then the source will equal this string.

12
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.410
Speed limit.

13
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.850
PNG will keep the width the same.

14
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.860
Go ahead and run your application.

15
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.340
Refresh the application.

16
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.960
And beautiful speed of 45 reminds them of the speed limit will pass in a speed of 70.

17
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.690
And do we have DevTools in here?

18
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.730
I guess I don't when after we run the application and now fast forward this video until I have.

19
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.900
Beautiful.

20
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.289
So here we are conditionally assigning a string value to source depending on what their speed is.
