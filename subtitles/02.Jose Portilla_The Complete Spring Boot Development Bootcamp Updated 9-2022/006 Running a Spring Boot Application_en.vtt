00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.390
There are many ways to run a spring boot application.

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.300
In this lesson, you will learn to run a spring boot app using MAVEN commands and the run button.

3
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.950
The first question you have to ask yourself is Where does the runtime start?

4
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.520
The entry point of your Spring Boot app is in the application Java file when you run your application.

5
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.130
The runtime starts here and it's the spring boot application annotation that instruments the launch

6
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.660
of a Spring Boot app.

7
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.240
Let's go through the first two MAVEN Command Spring Boot Run.

8
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.720
This command compiles and runs a spring boot application.

9
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.780
When it compiles your code, the compiled classes are going to go to the target folder and then it will

10
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.340
run your compiled code.

11
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.380
Your project should come with a maven wrapper.

12
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.860
We can use the maven wrapper to run Maven commands.

13
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.670
What I'm going to do is open up a new terminal by going to view tool Windows Terminal.

14
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.420
So right now our terminal points to the hello spraying folder and inside hello spraying.

15
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.850
We can access the maven wrapper like so.

16
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.110
If you're using a mac like myself, your maven command must follow a dot slash.

17
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.060
So now from the maven rapper, we can say maven spring boot run.

18
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.900
As you can see, it compiles your code into the target folder.

19
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.410
This is the compiled version of our Spring Java file.

20
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.300
And then it runs your compiled code.

21
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.820
Now a close equivalent to the spring boot run command would be to just press the run button.

22
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.920
Now you might think to yourself, Forget writing Maven commands, I'm just going to use the run button.

23
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.990
Not so fast.

24
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.600
I recommend running your code using this command.

25
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.420
Maven Clean Spring Boot Run.

26
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.410
The way this works is before starting the build, clean will remove compiled classes from the previous

27
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.040
build.

28
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.800
The ensuing goal as before will compile your code into the target folder and then the run the compiled

29
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.370
code.

30
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.390
I can use the up key to access previous terminal commands to our spring boots run command.

31
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.490
We will add a goal of clean.

32
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.130
And if you focus on the target folder as I run this command.

33
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.590
You'll notice that it removes the previously compiled code and then the ensuing goal will recompile

34
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.900
your code into target.

35
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.630
Beautiful.

36
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.560
Now the reason why I like to use Maven clean spring which run is because every now and then it's good

37
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.740
to start from scratch.

38
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.890
Sometimes I would get random bugs that were just solved by running from a fresh build.

39
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.930
So to recap, you learned three different ways to run a spring boot up.

40
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.020
Maven Spring Boot Run compiles your code into target and runs it.

41
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.330
The run button is a close equivalent.

42
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.590
Clean will remove compiled classes from the previous build.

43
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.670
And then Spring Boot to run will compile your code into target and run it.

44
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.750
Throughout this course, you'll notice I'll be using Maven Clean Spring Boot Run.
