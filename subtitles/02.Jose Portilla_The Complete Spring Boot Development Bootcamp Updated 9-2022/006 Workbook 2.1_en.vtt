00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.330
Welcome to Workbook 2.1 using the Spanish laser.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.500
The first thing you have to do is create a new project with the following attributes.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.570
I've already created the project and the interest of time, so we'll just jump right into Task One,

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.500
which is to create a handler method that can handle get requests made by the client on an empty path.

5
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.810
So we'll start by creating a new controller.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.290
We'll just call it workbook controller, dot java.

7
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.479
And we'll make this into a controller that can handle Web requests.

8
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.710
The first thing we have to do is when a client makes a request on an empty path.

9
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.990
We need to map this path to a handler method.

10
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.770
So we'll say public string.

11
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.300
I'll call the handler method, get shows.

12
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.070
And what it's going to do is return a show's HTML.

13
00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.420
That HTML is going to be located inside of the templates folder we'll just say shows that HTML.

14
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.450
But for this to work in order to work with templates, you need to have the file dependency installed.

15
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.100
So what we'll have to do is go to the central maven repo.

16
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.200
I already went there and copy the spring boot starter file leaf dependency.

17
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.030
You don't need to include the version because it's already going to share the same version as every

18
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.170
other spring boot starter.

19
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.980
So we're good there and I think now we're ready to set up our table.

20
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.350
Here it says to use.

21
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.300
Well, seems we missed a step.

22
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.090
We need this in our HTML.

23
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.160
So what I'll do is I'll create the HTML boilerplate thanks to our HTML extension.

24
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.800
If you're using intel, I already showed you how to set up an HTML file.

25
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.850
You can remove all this junk.

26
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.120
No scripts needed.

27
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.990
Only thing we'll keep is the following.

28
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.650
We'll just call this workbook copy and paste the header.

29
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.690
And now we can use the cheat sheet to create a table using the following data.

30
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.250
If you have a look at the cheat sheet, you'll notice there is a table element.

31
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.480
This table element can contain many table rows.

32
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.180
A table a row can contain many header cells, and it can also contain many data cells.

33
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.320
This is all the information we need to start creating.

34
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.970
A table.

35
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.320
A table can contain many table rows.

36
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.790
You'll remember this was the tag for a table rows.

37
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.990
And each row can contain many hetero cells.

38
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.670
We'll just copy this three more times.

39
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.220
And the headers are.

40
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.890
Title episode and rating.

41
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.430
Okay.

42
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.350
Now we'll create another row.

43
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.620
And this one will contain three data cells.

44
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.100
Okay.

45
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.770
The first title is Breaking Bad.

46
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.310
I can't even pronounce this.

47
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.840
And it has a rating of ten.

48
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.190
Okay.

49
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.400
We'll just copy this four more times.

50
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.990
The second title is Attack on Titan.

51
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.200
The title is Hero and it has an impressive 9.9.

52
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.590
I think the third one is also attack on Titan.

53
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.190
Perfect game.

54
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.170
9.9.

55
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.880
And you might be thinking, hey, this process is really tedious.

56
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.430
Do I have to go through this every single time I create a table?

57
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.580
Not really.

58
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.640
Once you really understand how life works and how we can use it to manipulate data that comes from the

59
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:21.050
back end into our view, this process becomes a lot easier as we learn to leverage time loops.

60
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.200
But right now, we'll just have to do it this way until we have expanded our skill sets.

61
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.850
Okay.

62
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.190
I think we're now ready to run our code.

63
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.040
Let me just make sure that everything is good.

64
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.540
Seems to be.

65
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.860
Do we have all of the dependencies installed?

66
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.970
We do.

67
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.370
This points to the show's HTML.

68
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.750
All right, I think we're ready.

69
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.760
Okay.

70
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.020
Let's say a local host, 80, 80, and there is our table, but it's not looking too pretty.

71
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.520
I think there were some instructions on styling.

72
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.010
So here what we can do is say.

73
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.540
What was it again?

74
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.830
The border should be solid.

75
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:28.540
So border equals solid and the width is equal to 100%.

76
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.480
We have def tools so we can just go ahead and refresh.

77
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.470
Beautiful.

78
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.230
See you in the next one.
