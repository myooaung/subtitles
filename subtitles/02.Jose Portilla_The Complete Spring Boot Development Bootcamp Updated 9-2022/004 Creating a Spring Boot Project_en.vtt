00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.680
Spring Boot is the best Java framework for developing web applications.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.130
In this video, you're going to create a spring boot project.

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.610
You actually need to extensions to develop a Springwood application, the extension pack for Java as

4
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.860
well as the spring boot extension pack.

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.360
So go back to the Visual Studio Code marketplace and then look for the spring boot extension pack.

6
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.490
There you have it.

7
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.630
Now I've already installed it, so I'll give you a couple of seconds to do the same.

8
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.440
Okay.

9
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.270
Once you install it, I want you to close the code and reopen it.

10
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.380
All right.

11
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.630
So let's talk about the spring initial riser.

12
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.440
The spring initial riser generates a spring boot project.

13
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.240
The spring boot extension pack includes the spring initial riser.

14
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.900
So from VW's code.

15
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.890
Open the command palette using control shift P for using windows and command shift P for Mac.

16
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.110
And then click on the spring initial riser.

17
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.290
And as of this recording, the most recent stable version of Spring Boot is 2.6.7.

18
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.100
The versions will be different depending on when you're watching this video.

19
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.870
So just choose a stable version.

20
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.460
In other words, choose one that doesn't precede parentheses.

21
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.730
Obviously you will use the Java programming language.

22
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.220
And the group ID identifies the organization creating the project.

23
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.500
Your group ID should be a fully qualified domain name.

24
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.610
It should include a domain extension like dot com, dot org dot net, followed by the name of the organization.

25
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.520
So for this tutorial I'm going to create a group ID of com dot http further in the part.

26
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.110
Now one thing I want to also mention is that the group ID should always be lowercase.

27
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.440
The artifact ID determines the name of your application.

28
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.140
I'm going to call the application.

29
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.130
Hello, Spring.

30
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.440
Collect the group ID.

31
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.110
The artifact ID must be lowercase as well.

32
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.470
And every word that follows must be separated by a hyphen.

33
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.660
We will stick with the default jar packaging type.

34
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.200
We're going to discuss packaging in more detail in an upcoming workbook.

35
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.590
Choose a Java version that matches the one you have installed.

36
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.270
I'm using Java 11, so I'll choose a Java version of 11.

37
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.950
Dependency is software that your application depends on.

38
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.100
We will discuss dependencies in more detail soon enough.

39
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.340
You don't need any dependencies right now.

40
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.360
And now you can generate your project inside the folder of your choice.

41
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.430
I'm going to generate it inside of my desktop directory.

42
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.030
Okay.

43
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.800
Go ahead and press open.

44
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.570
And it opens the project that you generated.

45
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.380
To recap, you created a spring boot project using the spring initial user recall that group ID identifies

46
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.630
the organization creating the project.

47
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.590
It should be a fully qualified domain name that's completely lowercase.

48
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.350
Artifact ID is the name of your application and every word that follows is joined by a hyphen.

49
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.130
Choose Jar as the file type to package your application, and a dependency is software that your application

50
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.060
depends on.
