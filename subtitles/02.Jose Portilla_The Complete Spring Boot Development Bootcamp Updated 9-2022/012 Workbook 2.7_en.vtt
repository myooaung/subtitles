00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.920
Welcome to Workbook 2.7.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.350
I already went ahead and launched the Starter Project.

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.810
Task one is inside the Handler method.

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.330
Before we return the leaf template.

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.910
Add our name as a model attribute.

6
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.010
So we'll say model dot add attribute and a name key will map to our name.

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.100
Second step is to create a paragraph element with a bold font weight that displays our name.

8
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.040
So right here we can create a paragraph element.

9
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:42.790
And the text that our paragraph element will display will be based on a type of expression, a variable

10
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.270
expression, to be more specific, that grabs our name.

11
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.270
And we want to give this paragraph tag a certain style of bold.

12
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.920
Copy that.

13
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.550
Over.

14
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.620
Simple enough.

15
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.590
And Task three is to create an unordered list with five list items so that each list item will display

16
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.240
the name inside the model.

17
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.260
If you go to our HTML cheat sheet, we'll look for unordered list.

18
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:24.460
Here we go and unordered list is specified by UL and list items are specified by ally.

19
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.870
So here we can create an unordered list.

20
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.700
That contains many list items.

21
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.270
All right.

22
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.930
Going back to Workbook 2.7.

23
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.860
And each list item is going to display our name.

24
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.290
So each list item will display text that is based on a timely expression.

25
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.020
And the text that it will display will be the name that we grab through a variable expression.

26
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.210
All right.

27
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.600
Let's run our code.

28
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.220
Go to local host 8080.

29
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.710
We're looking good so far.

30
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.470
Next step is we need to apply a utility method such that each list item displays one more letter than

31
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.490
the previous.

32
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:47.820
So we'll go to our life repo and we'll find a utility method that can return a substring by operating

33
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.760
on our string model attribute name.

34
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.270
And I'm familiar enough with Java to know that this method is going to be called substring.

35
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.360
Here we see the method in the first parameter we can pass in our model attribute.

36
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:11.340
Then it's going to return a string that starts at a particular index and ends at a particular index.

37
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.720
All right, so back into our workbook.

38
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.800
Followed by a pound sign.

39
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.830
Where are we going to grab this utility method from?

40
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.640
This utility method belongs to the strings class.

41
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.580
So we'll say strings.

42
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.590
The utility method that we want to use is called substring, dot substring.

43
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.570
The first thing you have to pass in is your model attribute name.

44
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.550
The second thing you have to pass in is the start index.

45
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:51.380
So we're going to start with the character at Index zero are in this case and the stop index, if this

46
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.760
is just like the substring java expression should be exclusive.

47
00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.980
So if we say 0 to 1, it's only going to grab the character at index zero.

48
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.690
All right, you know what?

49
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.820
Let's just copy this over instead.

50
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.350
And now this method will return a substring that starts at index zero and ends at index two.

51
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.360
So it's going to grab our A and once we get to index to why it's not going to grab that because the

52
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.500
stop index is exclusive.

53
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.560
So we'll say 0102030405.

54
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:35.270
And that should be enough because the letter end would be at index four and then index five is where

55
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.960
it stops.

56
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.970
So we should be good.

57
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.040
I'll refresh.

58
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.480
And we get the results.

59
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.560
That's it for Workbook 2.7.

60
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.210
I'll see you in the next one.
