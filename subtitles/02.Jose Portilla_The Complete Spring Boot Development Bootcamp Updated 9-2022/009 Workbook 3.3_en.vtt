Welcome to Workbook 3.3.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.800
In this workbook, you'll be creating two custom constraint annotations, not just one.

3
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:13.920
You'll create one that is going to check that the user is at least 18, and then you'll create another

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.210
one that will make sure that the username doesn't actually contain any special or uppercase characters.

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.610
As always, the instructions are linked at the resources that learn the part C at the next lecture.
