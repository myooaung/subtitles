There are two places where you can ask questions.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.360
You can ask questions inside the Udemy Q&A, or you can ask questions in the Discord community.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.090
If you ask questions in the Discord community, then you're likely to get a much faster reply because

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.950
it includes me as well as a whole community of students.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.680
But if you don't want your question to be broadcasted, I understand.

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.660
I also checked the Udemy Q&A so you can feel free to ask your questions here as well.
