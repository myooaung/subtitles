Welcome to Workbook 3.2, where we're going to teach you the concept of cross field validation.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.590
So for example, here we can see that individually each of these inputs is technically valid.

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.079
However, we want a first name and a last name.

4
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.510
We don't actually want them to match up.

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.760
So in this case, Ryan and Ryan as both first name and last name is invalid, which means we need to

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.420
use cross field validation to check for this.
