Hi everyone.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,400
My name is Wojciech Lesniak, and welcome to this course, Spring

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,170
Framework: Using Spring Security OAuth2 Login. OAuth2 and OpenID

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,890
Connect make it easy for your users to register and access your

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,150
application without providing their passwords.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,680
That's powerful.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,320
It can significantly improve user experience and make your

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,240
application more secure. In this course, we are going to implement

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,540
user authentication using OAuth2 OpenID Connect with Spring

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,700
Security OAuth2 login and Spring Boot.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,500
Some of the major topics that we will cover include adding

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,220
social login to your existing application,

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,460
completely outsourcing authentication in your application to an

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,320
authorization server, persistent login and logout with OpenID

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,840
Connect, dealing with public clients.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,150
By the end of this course,

17
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,340
you have the skills and knowledge of OAuth2 support in Spring

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,110
Security needed to secure modern day multi and singleâ€‘page

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,280
applications with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,140
Before beginning this course, you should be familiar with the Spring Framework.

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,630
I hope you will join me on this journey to learn OAuth2 login support

22
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:36,000
in Spring Security with the Spring Framework: Using Spring Security OAuth2 logging course, at Pluralsight.
