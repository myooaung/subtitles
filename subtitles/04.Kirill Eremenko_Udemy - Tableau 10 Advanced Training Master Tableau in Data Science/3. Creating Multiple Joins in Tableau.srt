00:00:00,020  -->  00:00:03,720

2

00:00:05,000  -->  00:00:07,980
Hello this is Kirill Eremenko and welcome back

3

00:00:07,980  -->  00:00:07,990

4

00:00:07,990  -->  00:00:11,220
to the advanced course on Tableau and in

5

00:00:11,220  -->  00:00:11,230

6

00:00:11,230  -->  00:00:13,350
today's tutorial we'll be connecting to

7

00:00:13,350  -->  00:00:13,360

8

00:00:13,360  -->  00:00:16,140
our data set for this section. Now we

9

00:00:16,140  -->  00:00:16,150

10

00:00:16,150  -->  00:00:18,960
decided to devote a whole tutorial for

11

00:00:18,960  -->  00:00:18,970

12

00:00:18,970  -->  00:00:21,599
our connection process just because

13

00:00:21,599  -->  00:00:21,609

14

00:00:21,609  -->  00:00:23,489
we're going to be discussing quite a lot

15

00:00:23,489  -->  00:00:23,499

16

00:00:23,499  -->  00:00:25,109
of things. We'll be talking about creating

17

00:00:25,109  -->  00:00:25,119

18

00:00:25,119  -->  00:00:27,419
a dummy column for conducting and join

19

00:00:27,419  -->  00:00:27,429

20

00:00:27,429  -->  00:00:28,589
we'll be talking about conducting

21

00:00:28,589  -->  00:00:28,599

22

00:00:28,599  -->  00:00:30,630
multiple live joins at the same time.

23

00:00:30,630  -->  00:00:30,640

24

00:00:30,640  -->  00:00:32,339
We'll be talking about pivoting our

25

00:00:32,339  -->  00:00:32,349

26

00:00:32,349  -->  00:00:34,020
data and changing metadata and a

27

00:00:34,020  -->  00:00:34,030

28

00:00:34,030  -->  00:00:36,090
couple of things on top of that. So

29

00:00:36,090  -->  00:00:36,100

30

00:00:36,100  -->  00:00:37,650
there's quite a lot of ground to cover

31

00:00:37,650  -->  00:00:37,660

32

00:00:37,660  -->  00:00:39,870
and let's jump straight into it.

33

00:00:39,870  -->  00:00:39,880

34

00:00:39,880  -->  00:00:41,970
First of all we'll connect to our excel

35

00:00:41,970  -->  00:00:41,980

36

00:00:41,980  -->  00:00:45,690
file which is coal terminal. Now as you

37

00:00:45,690  -->  00:00:45,700

38

00:00:45,700  -->  00:00:47,670
can see here there are quite a few tabs

39

00:00:47,670  -->  00:00:47,680

40

00:00:47,680  -->  00:00:50,700
and as we discussed each tab is for a

41

00:00:50,700  -->  00:00:50,710

42

00:00:50,710  -->  00:00:52,350
machine so there's reclaimer 1,

43

00:00:52,350  -->  00:00:52,360

44

00:00:52,360  -->  00:00:55,140
reclaimer 2, stack reclaimer 1, stack

45

00:00:55,140  -->  00:00:55,150

46

00:00:55,150  -->  00:00:58,020
reclaimer 4a, stacker reclaimer 6 and

47

00:00:58,020  -->  00:00:58,030

48

00:00:58,030  -->  00:00:59,130
those are the machines that we need to

49

00:00:59,130  -->  00:00:59,140

50

00:00:59,140  -->  00:01:01,290
analyze. Now how we going to go about

51

00:01:01,290  -->  00:01:01,300

52

00:01:01,300  -->  00:01:04,200
this data? What are the options here?

53

00:01:04,200  -->  00:01:04,210

54

00:01:04,210  -->  00:01:06,600
Well I  wanted to mention that with

55

00:01:06,600  -->  00:01:06,610

56

00:01:06,610  -->  00:01:10,440
visualization often there are many ways

57

00:01:10,440  -->  00:01:10,450

58

00:01:10,450  -->  00:01:12,720
of achieving the desired result.

59

00:01:12,720  -->  00:01:12,730

60

00:01:12,730  -->  00:01:14,310
So we have a business problem to solve

61

00:01:14,310  -->  00:01:14,320

62

00:01:14,320  -->  00:01:16,920
and we have a question to answer but how

63

00:01:16,920  -->  00:01:16,930

64

00:01:16,930  -->  00:01:19,620
we get to that question and what the

65

00:01:19,620  -->  00:01:19,630

66

00:01:19,630  -->  00:01:21,540
actual visualization looks in the end

67

00:01:21,540  -->  00:01:21,550

68

00:01:21,550  -->  00:01:23,760
can vary and it depends on your personal

69

00:01:23,760  -->  00:01:23,770

70

00:01:23,770  -->  00:01:25,440
preferences and dependent approach to

71

00:01:25,440  -->  00:01:25,450

72

00:01:25,450  -->  00:01:29,160
choose and a lot of the time, the way you

73

00:01:29,160  -->  00:01:29,170

74

00:01:29,170  -->  00:01:31,590
choose you structure your data set will

75

00:01:31,590  -->  00:01:31,600

76

00:01:31,600  -->  00:01:33,360
dictate which approach you will be

77

00:01:33,360  -->  00:01:33,370

78

00:01:33,370  -->  00:01:35,160
taking. So let me give you a couple

79

00:01:35,160  -->  00:01:35,170

80

00:01:35,170  -->  00:01:36,960
examples what we could do here is we

81

00:01:36,960  -->  00:01:36,970

82

00:01:36,970  -->  00:01:40,680
could connect to just the one tab for

83

00:01:40,680  -->  00:01:40,690

84

00:01:40,690  -->  00:01:43,020
this machine and start analyzing it

85

00:01:43,020  -->  00:01:43,030

86

00:01:43,030  -->  00:01:44,219
right away so just have that one

87

00:01:44,219  -->  00:01:44,229

88

00:01:44,229  -->  00:01:46,109
connection and then we finish we could

89

00:01:46,109  -->  00:01:46,119

90

00:01:46,119  -->  00:01:47,399
connect to the next machine and do the

91

00:01:47,399  -->  00:01:47,409

92

00:01:47,409  -->  00:01:49,230
analysis again and the next machine doing

93

00:01:49,230  -->  00:01:49,240

94

00:01:49,240  -->  00:01:51,300
analysis again and so on. So that's a valid

95

00:01:51,300  -->  00:01:51,310

96

00:01:51,310  -->  00:01:52,649
approach that's one of the ways you

97

00:01:52,649  -->  00:01:52,659

98

00:01:52,659  -->  00:01:54,359
could do it. The other way you could do

99

00:01:54,359  -->  00:01:54,369

100

00:01:54,369  -->  00:01:57,210
it, you could connect to these machines

101

00:01:57,210  -->  00:01:57,220

102

00:01:57,220  -->  00:01:58,859
separately but then you could blend the

103

00:01:58,859  -->  00:01:58,869

104

00:01:58,869  -->  00:02:01,740
data inside Tableau. Another way is you

105

00:02:01,740  -->  00:02:01,750

106

00:02:01,750  -->  00:02:03,539
could connect to them all together here

107

00:02:03,539  -->  00:02:03,549

108

00:02:03,549  -->  00:02:06,120
and create some joins over here and

109

00:02:06,120  -->  00:02:06,130

110

00:02:06,130  -->  00:02:07,800
that's exactly what we'll be doing in

111

00:02:07,800  -->  00:02:07,810

112

00:02:07,810  -->  00:02:09,389
this. There are other ways as well,

113

00:02:09,389  -->  00:02:09,399

114

00:02:09,399  -->  00:02:12,510
I'll give you another example so here's

115

00:02:12,510  -->  00:02:12,520

116

00:02:12,520  -->  00:02:15,660
here's a the data set that we working

117

00:02:15,660  -->  00:02:15,670

118

00:02:15,670  -->  00:02:16,890
with what you could do is you could

119

00:02:16,890  -->  00:02:16,900

120

00:02:16,900  -->  00:02:19,380
some data manipulations in Excel and

121

00:02:19,380  -->  00:02:19,390

122

00:02:19,390  -->  00:02:21,600
then connect to your data and that

123

00:02:21,600  -->  00:02:21,610

124

00:02:21,610  -->  00:02:24,210
is also valid approach so ultimately

125

00:02:24,210  -->  00:02:24,220

126

00:02:24,220  -->  00:02:27,149
approach you take with data dictates

127

00:02:27,149  -->  00:02:27,159

128

00:02:27,159  -->  00:02:30,059
the pathway that you'll go upon what

129

00:02:30,059  -->  00:02:30,069

130

00:02:30,069  -->  00:02:32,250
your barcode embarked upon in your

131

00:02:32,250  -->  00:02:32,260

132

00:02:32,260  -->  00:02:34,110
visualization process and it also

133

00:02:34,110  -->  00:02:34,120

134

00:02:34,120  -->  00:02:35,729
depends on what you want to achieve on

135

00:02:35,729  -->  00:02:35,739

136

00:02:35,739  -->  00:02:38,130
how you want to get to the end result. In

137

00:02:38,130  -->  00:02:38,140

138

00:02:38,140  -->  00:02:39,809
our case, I'll show you one of the ways

139

00:02:39,809  -->  00:02:39,819

140

00:02:39,819  -->  00:02:41,490
that this problem can be solved and that

141

00:02:41,490  -->  00:02:41,500

142

00:02:41,500  -->  00:02:44,399
is through join. So let's jump straight

143

00:02:44,399  -->  00:02:44,409

144

00:02:44,409  -->  00:02:46,530
into it. How would you conduct a joint

145

00:02:46,530  -->  00:02:46,540

146

00:02:46,540  -->  00:02:47,460
here?

147

00:02:47,460  -->  00:02:47,470

148

00:02:47,470  -->  00:02:48,869
Well first of all let's try to

149

00:02:48,869  -->  00:02:48,879

150

00:02:48,879  -->  00:02:50,009
understand what we're trying to achieve.

151

00:02:50,009  -->  00:02:50,019

152

00:02:50,019  -->  00:02:52,229
So here's our data set and what we're

153

00:02:52,229  -->  00:02:52,239

154

00:02:52,239  -->  00:02:54,149
trying to achieve is we're trying to

155

00:02:54,149  -->  00:02:54,159

156

00:02:54,159  -->  00:02:57,149
join on this date time column and bring

157

00:02:57,149  -->  00:02:57,159

158

00:02:57,159  -->  00:02:58,920
everything into one big table like this.

159

00:02:58,920  -->  00:02:58,930

160

00:02:58,930  -->  00:03:01,379
So let me give you an example, just do

161

00:03:01,379  -->  00:03:01,389

162

00:03:01,389  -->  00:03:03,149
some manipulation in excel and I'll

163

00:03:03,149  -->  00:03:03,159

164

00:03:03,159  -->  00:03:05,520
cancel them out. So here we've got a

165

00:03:05,520  -->  00:03:05,530

166

00:03:05,530  -->  00:03:07,559
reclaimer 1 what we want to do is we

167

00:03:07,559  -->  00:03:07,569

168

00:03:07,569  -->  00:03:09,330
want to take reclaimer 2 and based on

169

00:03:09,330  -->  00:03:09,340

170

00:03:09,340  -->  00:03:11,429
the day time column bring it in here

171

00:03:11,429  -->  00:03:11,439

172

00:03:11,439  -->  00:03:14,099
like that and we want to take this

173

00:03:14,099  -->  00:03:14,109

174

00:03:14,109  -->  00:03:16,259
stacker reclaimer and bring it in here

175

00:03:16,259  -->  00:03:16,269

176

00:03:16,269  -->  00:03:18,270
like that and so you get the point, we're

177

00:03:18,270  -->  00:03:18,280

178

00:03:18,280  -->  00:03:20,580
trying to join all of our tabs on the

179

00:03:20,580  -->  00:03:20,590

180

00:03:20,590  -->  00:03:22,650
daytime column so we have one big table

181

00:03:22,650  -->  00:03:22,660

182

00:03:22,660  -->  00:03:24,599
like this and then from there we will

183

00:03:24,599  -->  00:03:24,609

184

00:03:24,609  -->  00:03:26,879
can create pivot and we'll adjust the

185

00:03:26,879  -->  00:03:26,889

186

00:03:26,889  -->  00:03:29,849
metadata and will create a data

187

00:03:29,849  -->  00:03:29,859

188

00:03:29,859  -->  00:03:31,589
connection that will suit on it,  but the first

189

00:03:31,589  -->  00:03:31,599

190

00:03:31,599  -->  00:03:35,789
step is to create this massive join, so

191

00:03:35,789  -->  00:03:35,799

192

00:03:35,799  -->  00:03:38,520
how would you go about that in Tableau?

193

00:03:38,520  -->  00:03:38,530

194

00:03:38,530  -->  00:03:40,649
Well the first thing that comes to mind

195

00:03:40,649  -->  00:03:40,659

196

00:03:40,659  -->  00:03:42,839
is why don't we take the one of the

197

00:03:42,839  -->  00:03:42,849

198

00:03:42,849  -->  00:03:45,000
tabs for the example the first tab and

199

00:03:45,000  -->  00:03:45,010

200

00:03:45,010  -->  00:03:47,159
use it as the master tab and then we

201

00:03:47,159  -->  00:03:47,169

202

00:03:47,169  -->  00:03:49,050
will join the rest of the tabs using

203

00:03:49,050  -->  00:03:49,060

204

00:03:49,060  -->  00:03:52,469
left joints to that tab and of course

205

00:03:52,469  -->  00:03:52,479

206

00:03:52,479  -->  00:03:54,270
we're going to join not an actual times

207

00:03:54,270  -->  00:03:54,280

208

00:03:54,280  -->  00:03:56,699
button daytime and then we can take

209

00:03:56,699  -->  00:03:56,709

210

00:03:56,709  -->  00:03:59,580
another tab SR1 for instance, and do the

211

00:03:59,580  -->  00:03:59,590

212

00:03:59,590  -->  00:04:03,149
same thing, right there we go.

213

00:04:03,149  -->  00:04:03,159

214

00:04:03,159  -->  00:04:06,270
But two things jump into mind in regards

215

00:04:06,270  -->  00:04:06,280

216

00:04:06,280  -->  00:04:08,490
to this approach right away first of all

217

00:04:08,490  -->  00:04:08,500

218

00:04:08,500  -->  00:04:11,280
it's doesn't look symmetric right? You're

219

00:04:11,280  -->  00:04:11,290

220

00:04:11,290  -->  00:04:13,349
using one of the tabs as the master tab

221

00:04:13,349  -->  00:04:13,359

222

00:04:13,359  -->  00:04:14,610
and the rest of the tabs are kind of

223

00:04:14,610  -->  00:04:14,620

224

00:04:14,620  -->  00:04:16,529
auxiliary tabs that are being joined to

225

00:04:16,529  -->  00:04:16,539

226

00:04:16,539  -->  00:04:18,240
it, so it doesn't look symmetrical,

227

00:04:18,240  -->  00:04:18,250

228

00:04:18,250  -->  00:04:20,039
doesn't appear symmetrical but generally

229

00:04:20,039  -->  00:04:20,049

230

00:04:20,049  -->  00:04:21,930
speaking that's not a problem. If, if

231

00:04:21,930  -->  00:04:21,940

232

00:04:21,940  -->  00:04:23,939
everything is else is correct that's a

233

00:04:23,939  -->  00:04:23,949

234

00:04:23,949  -->  00:04:25,290
completely valid approach and you can

235

00:04:25,290  -->  00:04:25,300

236

00:04:25,300  -->  00:04:27,060
conduct enjoying that way but the other

237

00:04:27,060  -->  00:04:27,070

238

00:04:27,070  -->  00:04:28,709
thing the more important thing that

239

00:04:28,709  -->  00:04:28,719

240

00:04:28,719  -->  00:04:30,210
comes to mind is

241

00:04:30,210  -->  00:04:30,220

242

00:04:30,220  -->  00:04:32,310
what if there is missing data in the

243

00:04:32,310  -->  00:04:32,320

244

00:04:32,320  -->  00:04:34,410
daytime column over here? As you can see

245

00:04:34,410  -->  00:04:34,420

246

00:04:34,420  -->  00:04:36,480
we're doing a left join, assuming that

247

00:04:36,480  -->  00:04:36,490

248

00:04:36,490  -->  00:04:39,360
they might be missing data in these

249

00:04:39,360  -->  00:04:39,370

250

00:04:39,370  -->  00:04:41,790
columns but here that all of the hours

251

00:04:41,790  -->  00:04:41,800

252

00:04:41,800  -->  00:04:44,160
are definitely present and so you will

253

00:04:44,160  -->  00:04:44,170

254

00:04:44,170  -->  00:04:47,310
never get a situation when SR1 has a

255

00:04:47,310  -->  00:04:47,320

256

00:04:47,320  -->  00:04:50,550
daytime that it wants to join to only

257

00:04:50,550  -->  00:04:50,560

258

00:04:50,560  -->  00:04:52,920
wants to use to join but that daytime is

259

00:04:52,920  -->  00:04:52,930

260

00:04:52,930  -->  00:04:55,050
not present RL1 but that might not be

261

00:04:55,050  -->  00:04:55,060

262

00:04:55,060  -->  00:04:57,030
the case. Let's look at our data what

263

00:04:57,030  -->  00:04:57,040

264

00:04:57,040  -->  00:04:59,670
you will see here is as I go through the

265

00:04:59,670  -->  00:04:59,680

266

00:04:59,680  -->  00:05:02,460
tabs you will notice that the number of

267

00:05:02,460  -->  00:05:02,470

268

00:05:02,470  -->  00:05:04,410
records in each tab change and you can

269

00:05:04,410  -->  00:05:04,420

270

00:05:04,420  -->  00:05:07,470
see that just simply by observing this

271

00:05:07,470  -->  00:05:07,480

272

00:05:07,480  -->  00:05:09,960
scroll bar over here as you can see it

273

00:05:09,960  -->  00:05:09,970

274

00:05:09,970  -->  00:05:11,850
will change when I jump from one tab

275

00:05:11,850  -->  00:05:11,860

276

00:05:11,860  -->  00:05:13,200
to another, that's by the way that's a

277

00:05:13,200  -->  00:05:13,210

278

00:05:13,210  -->  00:05:15,900
handy trick just to observe if the

279

00:05:15,900  -->  00:05:15,910

280

00:05:15,910  -->  00:05:19,530
number of rows in tabs is the same but

281

00:05:19,530  -->  00:05:19,540

282

00:05:19,540  -->  00:05:20,910
otherwise you can also see right away

283

00:05:20,910  -->  00:05:20,920

284

00:05:20,920  -->  00:05:23,130
that here the data starts from six of

285

00:05:23,130  -->  00:05:23,140

286

00:05:23,140  -->  00:05:25,500
September and everywhere else it starts

287

00:05:25,500  -->  00:05:25,510

288

00:05:25,510  -->  00:05:27,480
from first of September so we don't

289

00:05:27,480  -->  00:05:27,490

290

00:05:27,490  -->  00:05:30,659
there is no guarantee that all of the

291

00:05:30,659  -->  00:05:30,669

292

00:05:30,669  -->  00:05:32,610
data is present in every single tab for

293

00:05:32,610  -->  00:05:32,620

294

00:05:32,620  -->  00:05:35,909
the date time field and in order to

295

00:05:35,909  -->  00:05:35,919

296

00:05:35,919  -->  00:05:38,310
avoid losing any data you know join what

297

00:05:38,310  -->  00:05:38,320

298

00:05:38,320  -->  00:05:39,120
we're going to do is we're going to

299

00:05:39,120  -->  00:05:39,130

300

00:05:39,130  -->  00:05:41,610
create a dummy column that we will use

301

00:05:41,610  -->  00:05:41,620

302

00:05:41,620  -->  00:05:44,610
as our master column for the join and

303

00:05:44,610  -->  00:05:44,620

304

00:05:44,620  -->  00:05:46,140
this is how you do it, all you have to do

305

00:05:46,140  -->  00:05:46,150

306

00:05:46,150  -->  00:05:48,000
is create a new sheet and this one we'll

307

00:05:48,000  -->  00:05:48,010

308

00:05:48,010  -->  00:05:50,790
call timeline and in this tab I will

309

00:05:50,790  -->  00:05:50,800

310

00:05:50,800  -->  00:05:53,460
just create one single column and I'll

311

00:05:53,460  -->  00:05:53,470

312

00:05:53,470  -->  00:05:55,020
call it daytime and I'll just copy the

313

00:05:55,020  -->  00:05:55,030

314

00:05:55,030  -->  00:05:58,860
first row from here. So that is our very

315

00:05:58,860  -->  00:05:58,870

316

00:05:58,870  -->  00:06:00,870
starting point and we already know that

317

00:06:00,870  -->  00:06:00,880

318

00:06:00,880  -->  00:06:02,190
we're dealing with the whole month

319

00:06:02,190  -->  00:06:02,200

320

00:06:02,200  -->  00:06:04,140
September so we want every single hour

321

00:06:04,140  -->  00:06:04,150

322

00:06:04,150  -->  00:06:06,150
in September, so what we want to do is

323

00:06:06,150  -->  00:06:06,160

324

00:06:06,160  -->  00:06:09,570
want to take this value and we want to

325

00:06:09,570  -->  00:06:09,580

326

00:06:09,580  -->  00:06:11,850
add time and we just want to add one

327

00:06:11,850  -->  00:06:11,860

328

00:06:11,860  -->  00:06:13,740
hour so this is how you do it in Excel

329

00:06:13,740  -->  00:06:13,750

330

00:06:13,750  -->  00:06:16,469
and that adds exactly one hour and so

331

00:06:16,469  -->  00:06:16,479

332

00:06:16,479  -->  00:06:18,120
now if I drag this down, you'll see that

333

00:06:18,120  -->  00:06:18,130

334

00:06:18,130  -->  00:06:21,600
every time it adds one hour to the cell

335

00:06:21,600  -->  00:06:21,610

336

00:06:21,610  -->  00:06:24,000
before. So that way

337

00:06:24,000  -->  00:06:24,010

338

00:06:24,010  -->  00:06:26,040
what we can do is we want to get to

339

00:06:26,040  -->  00:06:26,050

340

00:06:26,050  -->  00:06:30,960
about thirty or thirty first, 30th of

341

00:06:30,960  -->  00:06:30,970

342

00:06:30,970  -->  00:06:33,450
September right? So there's 26th of

343

00:06:33,450  -->  00:06:33,460

344

00:06:33,460  -->  00:06:36,390
September, there's 2nd of October so we

345

00:06:36,390  -->  00:06:36,400

346

00:06:36,400  -->  00:06:37,860
just want to get rid of October we know

347

00:06:37,860  -->  00:06:37,870

348

00:06:37,870  -->  00:06:39,800
we're not dealing with October

349

00:06:39,800  -->  00:06:39,810

350

00:06:39,810  -->  00:06:42,170
and there we go, 30th of  September.

351

00:06:42,170  -->  00:06:42,180

352

00:06:42,180  -->  00:06:44,180
What we just did is we create a column

353

00:06:44,180  -->  00:06:44,190

354

00:06:44,190  -->  00:06:46,310
that definitely has all the values that

355

00:06:46,310  -->  00:06:46,320

356

00:06:46,320  -->  00:06:48,470
we need and one more thing that you

357

00:06:48,470  -->  00:06:48,480

358

00:06:48,480  -->  00:06:49,940
might want to do is copy the whole

359

00:06:49,940  -->  00:06:49,950

360

00:06:49,950  -->  00:06:53,420
column and paste special as just values so

361

00:06:53,420  -->  00:06:53,430

362

00:06:53,430  -->  00:06:54,830
you don't have those formulas in there

363

00:06:54,830  -->  00:06:54,840

364

00:06:54,840  -->  00:06:55,400
anymore.

365

00:06:55,400  -->  00:06:55,410

366

00:06:55,410  -->  00:06:57,560
Now if we save this and just go back to

367

00:06:57,560  -->  00:06:57,570

368

00:06:57,570  -->  00:07:01,280
Tableau, all you have to do is you

369

00:07:01,280  -->  00:07:01,290

370

00:07:01,290  -->  00:07:03,020
probably need to close Tableau because if

371

00:07:03,020  -->  00:07:03,030

372

00:07:03,030  -->  00:07:05,390
you update this it doesn't always pick

373

00:07:05,390  -->  00:07:05,400

374

00:07:05,400  -->  00:07:08,780
up the new tabs right away. So just if

375

00:07:08,780  -->  00:07:08,790

376

00:07:08,790  -->  00:07:11,870
you quickly close Tableau and open it

377

00:07:11,870  -->  00:07:11,880

378

00:07:11,880  -->  00:07:14,390
up again and now if we connect the

379

00:07:14,390  -->  00:07:14,400

380

00:07:14,400  -->  00:07:17,210
connection again, you will see that the

381

00:07:17,210  -->  00:07:17,220

382

00:07:17,220  -->  00:07:19,640
new tab has appeared timeline, now we can

383

00:07:19,640  -->  00:07:19,650

384

00:07:19,650  -->  00:07:21,980
use this tab to conduct our join, so

385

00:07:21,980  -->  00:07:21,990

386

00:07:21,990  -->  00:07:24,710
there's RL1, RL2 as you can see

387

00:07:24,710  -->  00:07:24,720

388

00:07:24,720  -->  00:07:27,379
automatically it's joining on daytime so

389

00:07:27,379  -->  00:07:27,389

390

00:07:27,389  -->  00:07:29,420
let's just add a few more in or will

391

00:07:29,420  -->  00:07:29,430

392

00:07:29,430  -->  00:07:32,270
actually hold on them in as there you

393

00:07:32,270  -->  00:07:32,280

394

00:07:32,280  -->  00:07:32,960
go.

395

00:07:32,960  -->  00:07:32,970

396

00:07:32,970  -->  00:07:39,260
So make some space and let's just make

397

00:07:39,260  -->  00:07:39,270

398

00:07:39,270  -->  00:07:45,050
them left all them left joins there we

399

00:07:45,050  -->  00:07:45,060

400

00:07:45,060  -->  00:07:50,510
go. So that is our timeline that is how

401

00:07:50,510  -->  00:07:50,520

402

00:07:50,520  -->  00:07:52,670
we connect your data set, so down here

403

00:07:52,670  -->  00:07:52,680

404

00:07:52,680  -->  00:07:55,730
you can see all the data that will

405

00:07:55,730  -->  00:07:55,740

406

00:07:55,740  -->  00:07:58,430
be working with and already there is

407

00:07:58,430  -->  00:07:58,440

408

00:07:58,440  -->  00:08:00,650
quite a lot of field now. What we want to

409

00:08:00,650  -->  00:08:00,660

410

00:08:00,660  -->  00:08:02,420
do is want to bring them all into one

411

00:08:02,420  -->  00:08:02,430

412

00:08:02,430  -->  00:08:04,909
format and what we want is we want to

413

00:08:04,909  -->  00:08:04,919

414

00:08:04,919  -->  00:08:09,290
date and we want them and just a value

415

00:08:09,290  -->  00:08:09,300

416

00:08:09,300  -->  00:08:12,590
so I value for the nominal or actual

417

00:08:12,590  -->  00:08:12,600

418

00:08:12,600  -->  00:08:15,020
tons and also we want of course the

419

00:08:15,020  -->  00:08:15,030

420

00:08:15,030  -->  00:08:17,779
description which machine that is for. So

421

00:08:17,779  -->  00:08:17,789

422

00:08:17,789  -->  00:08:19,670
first thing we want to do is as you can

423

00:08:19,670  -->  00:08:19,680

424

00:08:19,680  -->  00:08:21,650
see here let's go to the metadata so

425

00:08:21,650  -->  00:08:21,660

426

00:08:21,660  -->  00:08:24,710
here what you can see is that all of

427

00:08:24,710  -->  00:08:24,720

428

00:08:24,720  -->  00:08:26,779
them have an indication which sheet they

429

00:08:26,779  -->  00:08:26,789

430

00:08:26,789  -->  00:08:27,710
came from,

431

00:08:27,710  -->  00:08:27,720

432

00:08:27,720  -->  00:08:30,740
except for this nominal capacity and

433

00:08:30,740  -->  00:08:30,750

434

00:08:30,750  -->  00:08:33,199
these actual tons for RL1, so let's go

435

00:08:33,199  -->  00:08:33,209

436

00:08:33,209  -->  00:08:34,550
ahead. We can see that they're from RL1

437

00:08:34,550  -->  00:08:35,050

438

00:08:35,050  -->  00:08:36,469
here let's go ahead and just type

439

00:08:36,469  -->  00:08:36,479

440

00:08:36,479  -->  00:08:38,990
that in so that we don't lose this

441

00:08:38,990  -->  00:08:39,000

442

00:08:39,000  -->  00:08:42,199
information and that will be a bit more

443

00:08:42,199  -->  00:08:42,209

444

00:08:42,209  -->  00:08:43,279
convenient for us

445

00:08:43,279  -->  00:08:43,289

446

00:08:43,289  -->  00:08:45,740
good, now if we go back to the table, we

447

00:08:45,740  -->  00:08:45,750

448

00:08:45,750  -->  00:08:47,660
know we already have a date time column

449

00:08:47,660  -->  00:08:47,670

450

00:08:47,670  -->  00:08:49,970
which is this one which we are working

451

00:08:49,970  -->  00:08:49,980

452

00:08:49,980  -->  00:08:51,680
with. Let's get rid of all the other day

453

00:08:51,680  -->  00:08:51,690

454

00:08:51,690  -->  00:08:53,180
times columns.

455

00:08:53,180  -->  00:08:53,190

456

00:08:53,190  -->  00:08:56,540
So that day time we don't need I'm just

457

00:08:56,540  -->  00:08:56,550

458

00:08:56,550  -->  00:08:59,420
going to hold down control and select all

459

00:08:59,420  -->  00:08:59,430

460

00:08:59,430  -->  00:09:04,070
the daytimes I can find and if I right

461

00:09:04,070  -->  00:09:04,080

462

00:09:04,080  -->  00:09:06,320
click and press hide they'll, they'll go

463

00:09:06,320  -->  00:09:06,330

464

00:09:06,330  -->  00:09:07,130
away.

465

00:09:07,130  -->  00:09:07,140

466

00:09:07,140  -->  00:09:10,490
So let's see if we have any more looks

467

00:09:10,490  -->  00:09:10,500

468

00:09:10,500  -->  00:09:12,770
like we're only left with values now, all

469

00:09:12,770  -->  00:09:12,780

470

00:09:12,780  -->  00:09:14,660
we have to do is create a pivot and to

471

00:09:14,660  -->  00:09:14,670

472

00:09:14,670  -->  00:09:15,260
do that,

473

00:09:15,260  -->  00:09:15,270

474

00:09:15,270  -->  00:09:19,280
just select all of the value rows the

475

00:09:19,280  -->  00:09:19,290

476

00:09:19,290  -->  00:09:21,440
measures and right click and click pivot

477

00:09:21,440  -->  00:09:21,450

478

00:09:21,450  -->  00:09:24,050
and there you go it's as simple as that.

479

00:09:24,050  -->  00:09:24,060

480

00:09:24,060  -->  00:09:25,880
Now we have a daytime column, we've got a

481

00:09:25,880  -->  00:09:25,890

482

00:09:25,890  -->  00:09:28,370
pivot field name and we've got a pivot

483

00:09:28,370  -->  00:09:28,380

484

00:09:28,380  -->  00:09:30,080
field value, so once again we talked

485

00:09:30,080  -->  00:09:30,090

486

00:09:30,090  -->  00:09:32,060
about this in the basic Tableau course,

487

00:09:32,060  -->  00:09:32,070

488

00:09:32,070  -->  00:09:33,710
they should be you should be pretty

489

00:09:33,710  -->  00:09:33,720

490

00:09:33,720  -->  00:09:35,630
comfortable with this right now if not

491

00:09:35,630  -->  00:09:35,640

492

00:09:35,640  -->  00:09:37,880
please revise the basic course in

493

00:09:37,880  -->  00:09:37,890

494

00:09:37,890  -->  00:09:41,000
Tableau otherwise this is how we create

495

00:09:41,000  -->  00:09:41,010

496

00:09:41,010  -->  00:09:43,790
our data connection and finally we can

497

00:09:43,790  -->  00:09:43,800

498

00:09:43,800  -->  00:09:46,010
change the names of these fields in our

499

00:09:46,010  -->  00:09:46,020

500

00:09:46,020  -->  00:09:49,220
metadata. Let's change the field name, pivot

501

00:09:49,220  -->  00:09:49,230

502

00:09:49,230  -->  00:09:55,550
virtual names to machine and pivot field

503

00:09:55,550  -->  00:09:55,560

504

00:09:55,560  -->  00:09:57,410
values. We're going to change to tons

505

00:09:57,410  -->  00:09:57,420

506

00:09:57,420  -->  00:09:59,960
because we know that its measured in

507

00:09:59,960  -->  00:09:59,970

508

00:09:59,970  -->  00:10:01,760
tons.

509

00:10:01,760  -->  00:10:01,770

510

00:10:01,770  -->  00:10:04,130
Alright so that is our connection, let's

511

00:10:04,130  -->  00:10:04,140

512

00:10:04,140  -->  00:10:06,050
go back to the table as you can see here

513

00:10:06,050  -->  00:10:06,060

514

00:10:06,060  -->  00:10:07,220
we've got the day time,

515

00:10:07,220  -->  00:10:07,230

516

00:10:07,230  -->  00:10:08,570
We've got the machine which also

517

00:10:08,570  -->  00:10:08,580

518

00:10:08,580  -->  00:10:11,630
specifies whether it's actual tons or

519

00:10:11,630  -->  00:10:11,640

520

00:10:11,640  -->  00:10:16,430
its or it is nominal capacity and we've

521

00:10:16,430  -->  00:10:16,440

522

00:10:16,440  -->  00:10:18,710
got the measure. Hope you found this

523

00:10:18,710  -->  00:10:18,720

524

00:10:18,720  -->  00:10:21,020
tutorial useful and picked up a few new

525

00:10:21,020  -->  00:10:21,030

526

00:10:21,030  -->  00:10:23,000
skills and we'll pick up from here in

527

00:10:23,000  -->  00:10:23,010

528

00:10:23,010  -->  00:10:24,260
the next tutorial. I look forward to

529

00:10:24,260  -->  00:10:24,270

530

00:10:24,270  -->  00:10:29,750
seeing you then.
