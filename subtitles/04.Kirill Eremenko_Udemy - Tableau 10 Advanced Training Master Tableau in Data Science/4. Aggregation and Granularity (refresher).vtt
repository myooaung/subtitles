00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.650
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06.650  -->  00:00:06.660

3

00:00:06.660  -->  00:00:08.059
course in Tableau. In today's tutorial

4

00:00:08.059  -->  00:00:08.069

5

00:00:08.069  -->  00:00:09.860
we're going to have a quick refresher of

6

00:00:09.860  -->  00:00:09.870

7

00:00:09.870  -->  00:00:12.259
the concepts of aggregation and

8

00:00:12.259  -->  00:00:12.269

9

00:00:12.269  -->  00:00:14.270
granularity because we're going to be

10

00:00:14.270  -->  00:00:14.280

11

00:00:14.280  -->  00:00:16.640
using them quite a lot in level of

12

00:00:16.640  -->  00:00:16.650

13

00:00:16.650  -->  00:00:18.290
detailed calculations, we're going to

14

00:00:18.290  -->  00:00:18.300

15

00:00:18.300  -->  00:00:19.790
be using those terms, going to be talking

16

00:00:19.790  -->  00:00:19.800

17

00:00:19.800  -->  00:00:21.769
about aggregation, we're going to talk

18

00:00:21.769  -->  00:00:21.779

19

00:00:21.779  -->  00:00:24.740
about granularity and so it's just a

20

00:00:24.740  -->  00:00:24.750

21

00:00:24.750  -->  00:00:26.630
good idea to quickly refresh our

22

00:00:26.630  -->  00:00:26.640

23

00:00:26.640  -->  00:00:27.950
knowledge on those topics.

24

00:00:27.950  -->  00:00:27.960

25

00:00:27.960  -->  00:00:30.200
Alright so let's get started, here we've

26

00:00:30.200  -->  00:00:30.210

27

00:00:30.210  -->  00:00:31.189
got our chart that we've already

28

00:00:31.189  -->  00:00:31.199

29

00:00:31.199  -->  00:00:33.440
prepared and what I'm going to do is I'm

30

00:00:33.440  -->  00:00:33.450

31

00:00:33.450  -->  00:00:36.830
just going to take profit and drag it

32

00:00:36.830  -->  00:00:36.840

33

00:00:36.840  -->  00:00:39.319
into label and so here you can see that

34

00:00:39.319  -->  00:00:39.329

35

00:00:39.329  -->  00:00:42.619
the profits for the cities have appeared

36

00:00:42.619  -->  00:00:42.629

37

00:00:42.629  -->  00:00:45.260
and we know that our data set isn't

38

00:00:45.260  -->  00:00:45.270

39

00:00:45.270  -->  00:00:47.479
actually at the city level. Our data set

40

00:00:47.479  -->  00:00:47.489

41

00:00:47.489  -->  00:00:50.840
is if I look at out, view data, a data set is

42

00:00:50.840  -->  00:00:50.850

43

00:00:50.850  -->  00:00:53.720
not even an order level it's actually at

44

00:00:53.720  -->  00:00:53.730

45

00:00:53.730  -->  00:00:56.689
item level so here every single row

46

00:00:56.689  -->  00:00:56.699

47

00:00:56.699  -->  00:01:00.080
doesn't represent a city even though on

48

00:01:00.080  -->  00:01:00.090

49

00:01:00.090  -->  00:01:02.689
our chart we see cities every single row

50

00:01:02.689  -->  00:01:02.699

51

00:01:02.699  -->  00:01:05.600
represents an item of an order and then

52

00:01:05.600  -->  00:01:05.610

53

00:01:05.610  -->  00:01:07.969
so in a city you might have multiple

54

00:01:07.969  -->  00:01:07.979

55

00:01:07.979  -->  00:01:09.950
orders and in each order you might have

56

00:01:09.950  -->  00:01:09.960

57

00:01:09.960  -->  00:01:12.590
multiple items and but at the same time

58

00:01:12.590  -->  00:01:12.600

59

00:01:12.600  -->  00:01:14.450
Tableau is showing us the profit per

60

00:01:14.450  -->  00:01:14.460

61

00:01:14.460  -->  00:01:16.190
city so for instance here's the profit

62

00:01:16.190  -->  00:01:16.200

63

00:01:16.200  -->  00:01:19.310
for Rock Springs it was minus 5,602

64

00:01:19.310  -->  00:01:19.320

65

00:01:19.320  -->  00:01:21.440
and bear in mind this is for all the

66

00:01:21.440  -->  00:01:21.450

67

00:01:21.450  -->  00:01:24.140
years in our data set. We've got several

68

00:01:24.140  -->  00:01:24.150

69

00:01:24.150  -->  00:01:27.230
years, so we've got order date it's got

70

00:01:27.230  -->  00:01:27.240

71

00:01:27.240  -->  00:01:29.060
multiple years here so that's another

72

00:01:29.060  -->  00:01:29.070

73

00:01:29.070  -->  00:01:31.609
level of information that is present in

74

00:01:31.609  -->  00:01:31.619

75

00:01:31.619  -->  00:01:34.670
our data set so Tableau is adding up all

76

00:01:34.670  -->  00:01:34.680

77

00:01:34.680  -->  00:01:36.740
the items so the profit for all the

78

00:01:36.740  -->  00:01:36.750

79

00:01:36.750  -->  00:01:38.780
items for all of the orders for all the

80

00:01:38.780  -->  00:01:38.790

81

00:01:38.790  -->  00:01:41.030
years for the city and is showing us

82

00:01:41.030  -->  00:01:41.040

83

00:01:41.040  -->  00:01:43.639
this total over here and now if I take,

84

00:01:43.639  -->  00:01:43.649

85

00:01:43.649  -->  00:01:45.260
remove city from here and just leave it

86

00:01:45.260  -->  00:01:45.270

87

00:01:45.270  -->  00:01:47.960
at state now Tableau is showing

88

00:01:47.960  -->  00:01:47.970

89

00:01:47.970  -->  00:01:49.399
something else, it's showing us the total

90

00:01:49.399  -->  00:01:49.409

91

00:01:49.409  -->  00:01:52.340
profit for all the items or all of the

92

00:01:52.340  -->  00:01:52.350

93

00:01:52.350  -->  00:01:55.639
orders across all the cities across all

94

00:01:55.639  -->  00:01:55.649

95

00:01:55.649  -->  00:01:59.090
of the years in each individual state, so

96

00:01:59.090  -->  00:01:59.100

97

00:01:59.100  -->  00:02:01.039
it's adding it up at state level. So as

98

00:02:01.039  -->  00:02:01.049

99

00:02:01.049  -->  00:02:03.109
you can see I can take out state as well

100

00:02:03.109  -->  00:02:03.119

101

00:02:03.119  -->  00:02:06.020
now it's showing us the total profit for

102

00:02:06.020  -->  00:02:06.030

103

00:02:06.030  -->  00:02:08.690
just the whole the US for across all the

104

00:02:08.690  -->  00:02:08.700

105

00:02:08.700  -->  00:02:09.760
times

106

00:02:09.760  -->  00:02:09.770

107

00:02:09.770  -->  00:02:11.740
across all of the items in all the

108

00:02:11.740  -->  00:02:11.750

109

00:02:11.750  -->  00:02:13.600
orders and all the cities in all of the

110

00:02:13.600  -->  00:02:13.610

111

00:02:13.610  -->  00:02:16.180
states so that's how it works and it's

112

00:02:16.180  -->  00:02:16.190

113

00:02:16.190  -->  00:02:17.620
so here as you can see this

114

00:02:17.620  -->  00:02:17.630

115

00:02:17.630  -->  00:02:20.890
visualization right now is the least

116

00:02:20.890  -->  00:02:20.900

117

00:02:20.900  -->  00:02:22.930
granular, so the level of granularity is

118

00:02:22.930  -->  00:02:22.940

119

00:02:22.940  -->  00:02:26.260
very low but level of aggregation is

120

00:02:26.260  -->  00:02:26.270

121

00:02:26.270  -->  00:02:28.510
very high, aggregation and granularity

122

00:02:28.510  -->  00:02:28.520

123

00:02:28.520  -->  00:02:30.580
they are the opposite of each other. So

124

00:02:30.580  -->  00:02:30.590

125

00:02:30.590  -->  00:02:32.800
if I increase, if I add state now,

126

00:02:32.800  -->  00:02:32.810

127

00:02:32.810  -->  00:02:35.980
granularity has increased, aggregation

128

00:02:35.980  -->  00:02:35.990

129

00:02:35.990  -->  00:02:39.280
has decreased, if I add city granularity

130

00:02:39.280  -->  00:02:39.290

131

00:02:39.290  -->  00:02:41.830
has increased even further, aggregation has

132

00:02:41.830  -->  00:02:41.840

133

00:02:41.840  -->  00:02:44.530
decreased once again and that is the

134

00:02:44.530  -->  00:02:44.540

135

00:02:44.540  -->  00:02:46.630
concept of aggregation and granularity and

136

00:02:46.630  -->  00:02:46.640

137

00:02:46.640  -->  00:02:50.440
how does Tableau know at which level to

138

00:02:50.440  -->  00:02:50.450

139

00:02:50.450  -->  00:02:52.600
aggregate the information. How does it know

140

00:02:52.600  -->  00:02:52.610

141

00:02:52.610  -->  00:02:55.210
that we want to see the profits for the

142

00:02:55.210  -->  00:02:55.220

143

00:02:55.220  -->  00:02:56.860
city or in this case?

144

00:02:56.860  -->  00:02:56.870

145

00:02:56.870  -->  00:02:58.870
Well Tableau what Tableau does is it

146

00:02:58.870  -->  00:02:58.880

147

00:02:58.880  -->  00:03:01.390
looks at the dimensions that you have

148

00:03:01.390  -->  00:03:01.400

149

00:03:01.400  -->  00:03:04.180
here. So the concept is that measures is

150

00:03:04.180  -->  00:03:04.190

151

00:03:04.190  -->  00:03:06.640
what gets aggregated and dimensions

152

00:03:06.640  -->  00:03:06.650

153

00:03:06.650  -->  00:03:09.010
specify the level at which the

154

00:03:09.010  -->  00:03:09.020

155

00:03:09.020  -->  00:03:10.480
aggregation happens, so the level of

156

00:03:10.480  -->  00:03:10.490

157

00:03:10.490  -->  00:03:12.460
aggregation or you can also talk

158

00:03:12.460  -->  00:03:12.470

159

00:03:12.470  -->  00:03:15.430
about as a level of granularity. So that

160

00:03:15.430  -->  00:03:15.440

161

00:03:15.440  -->  00:03:17.020
is how Tableau understand these things

162

00:03:17.020  -->  00:03:17.030

163

00:03:17.030  -->  00:03:20.560
and the way you can add to the

164

00:03:20.560  -->  00:03:20.570

165

00:03:20.570  -->  00:03:22.660
visualization is you can use either the

166

00:03:22.660  -->  00:03:22.670

167

00:03:22.670  -->  00:03:25.449
columns, the rows, the detail, the label,

168

00:03:25.449  -->  00:03:25.459

169

00:03:25.459  -->  00:03:27.730
the size and the color but not the

170

00:03:27.730  -->  00:03:27.740

171

00:03:27.740  -->  00:03:29.770
tooltip in order to change the

172

00:03:29.770  -->  00:03:29.780

173

00:03:29.780  -->  00:03:31.960
aggregation granularity so if you take a

174

00:03:31.960  -->  00:03:31.970

175

00:03:31.970  -->  00:03:35.050
dimension and you drag it into one of

176

00:03:35.050  -->  00:03:35.060

177

00:03:35.060  -->  00:03:38.560
those items that I mentioned then what

178

00:03:38.560  -->  00:03:38.570

179

00:03:38.570  -->  00:03:39.670
will happen is that will change the

180

00:03:39.670  -->  00:03:39.680

181

00:03:39.680  -->  00:03:41.740
aggregation granularity. So that was a

182

00:03:41.740  -->  00:03:41.750

183

00:03:41.750  -->  00:03:43.630
very quick refresher aggregation

184

00:03:43.630  -->  00:03:43.640

185

00:03:43.640  -->  00:03:44.920
granularity and that should be

186

00:03:44.920  -->  00:03:44.930

187

00:03:44.930  -->  00:03:45.640
sufficient.

188

00:03:45.640  -->  00:03:45.650

189

00:03:45.650  -->  00:03:47.410
I look forward to you on the next trial

190

00:03:47.410  -->  00:03:47.420

191

00:03:47.420  -->  00:03:54.370
and until then, happy analyzing.
