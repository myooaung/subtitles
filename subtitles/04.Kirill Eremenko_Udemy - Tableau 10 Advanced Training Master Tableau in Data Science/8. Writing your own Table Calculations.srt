00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,680
Welcome back to the advanced course in

2

00:00:06,680  -->  00:00:10,459
Tableau! Today, we will learn a new and

3

00:00:10,459  -->  00:00:10,469

4

00:00:10,469  -->  00:00:12,830
very important skill, we will learn how to

5

00:00:12,830  -->  00:00:12,840

6

00:00:12,840  -->  00:00:15,919
write our own table calculations and by

7

00:00:15,919  -->  00:00:15,929

8

00:00:15,929  -->  00:00:18,859
right i mean create formulas for our own

9

00:00:18,859  -->  00:00:18,869

10

00:00:18,869  -->  00:00:21,109
table calculations but before we do, it

11

00:00:21,109  -->  00:00:21,119

12

00:00:21,119  -->  00:00:23,090
has just occurred to me that I still

13

00:00:23,090  -->  00:00:23,100

14

00:00:23,100  -->  00:00:26,300
have not explained these gaps in our

15

00:00:26,300  -->  00:00:26,310

16

00:00:26,310  -->  00:00:28,339
visuals. You're probably sitting there

17

00:00:28,339  -->  00:00:28,349

18

00:00:28,349  -->  00:00:30,769
wondering when is Kirill going to

19

00:00:30,769  -->  00:00:30,779

20

00:00:30,779  -->  00:00:33,170
explain why we have gaps in our

21

00:00:33,170  -->  00:00:33,180

22

00:00:33,180  -->  00:00:35,750
visualization? What do they mean? Well

23

00:00:35,750  -->  00:00:35,760

24

00:00:35,760  -->  00:00:37,910
let's talk about that quickly for a

25

00:00:37,910  -->  00:00:37,920

26

00:00:37,920  -->  00:00:40,790
couple seconds, so what is going on here?

27

00:00:40,790  -->  00:00:40,800

28

00:00:40,800  -->  00:00:42,740
Well, you can see that this machine

29

00:00:42,740  -->  00:00:42,750

30

00:00:42,750  -->  00:00:44,299
doesn't have any gaps. This machine

31

00:00:44,299  -->  00:00:44,309

32

00:00:44,309  -->  00:00:46,190
doesn't have any gaps either and this is

33

00:00:46,190  -->  00:00:46,200

34

00:00:46,200  -->  00:00:49,340
because these machines are rl1 and rl2

35

00:00:49,340  -->  00:00:49,350

36

00:00:49,350  -->  00:00:51,709
they're reclaimers. So reclaimer one,

37

00:00:51,709  -->  00:00:51,719

38

00:00:51,719  -->  00:00:53,810
reclaimer two. All they do is always

39

00:00:53,810  -->  00:00:53,820

40

00:00:53,820  -->  00:00:58,729
they collect call and then they send it

41

00:00:58,729  -->  00:00:58,739

42

00:00:58,739  -->  00:01:01,369
off to the ship's whereas these machines

43

00:01:01,369  -->  00:01:01,379

44

00:01:01,379  -->  00:01:05,719
over here these are srs, sr1 4a and 6, SR

45

00:01:05,719  -->  00:01:05,729

46

00:01:05,729  -->  00:01:08,359
stands for stacker reclaimer and as we

47

00:01:08,359  -->  00:01:08,369

48

00:01:08,369  -->  00:01:11,060
were told in the assignment, sometimes

49

00:01:11,060  -->  00:01:11,070

50

00:01:11,070  -->  00:01:14,600
stackers are as told to stack whole

51

00:01:14,600  -->  00:01:14,610

52

00:01:14,610  -->  00:01:16,940
sometimes stackers are called told to

53

00:01:16,940  -->  00:01:16,950

54

00:01:16,950  -->  00:01:19,340
reclaim call. So basically what this

55

00:01:19,340  -->  00:01:19,350

56

00:01:19,350  -->  00:01:21,530
means is that this machine for the

57

00:01:21,530  -->  00:01:21,540

58

00:01:21,540  -->  00:01:23,390
start, from the start of the month

59

00:01:23,390  -->  00:01:23,400

60

00:01:23,400  -->  00:01:26,630
all the way up until somewhere around 13th

61

00:01:26,630  -->  00:01:26,640

62

00:01:26,640  -->  00:01:30,649
of September it was reclaiming call and

63

00:01:30,649  -->  00:01:30,659

64

00:01:30,659  -->  00:01:35,240
then it was told to go and stack coal, so

65

00:01:35,240  -->  00:01:35,250

66

00:01:35,250  -->  00:01:37,100
it was put on a different job and that's

67

00:01:37,100  -->  00:01:37,110

68

00:01:37,110  -->  00:01:38,359
why we don't have any data because

69

00:01:38,359  -->  00:01:38,369

70

00:01:38,369  -->  00:01:42,109
in our analysis were only analyzing the

71

00:01:42,109  -->  00:01:42,119

72

00:01:42,119  -->  00:01:45,950
utilization of reclaimers and then once

73

00:01:45,950  -->  00:01:45,960

74

00:01:45,960  -->  00:01:48,740
again it returned back to being a

75

00:01:48,740  -->  00:01:48,750

76

00:01:48,750  -->  00:01:50,300
reclaimer. Same thing happened here

77

00:01:50,300  -->  00:01:50,310

78

00:01:50,310  -->  00:01:52,429
it was so this machine was stacking cold

79

00:01:52,429  -->  00:01:52,439

80

00:01:52,439  -->  00:01:54,020
and was reclaiming called it was stacking

81

00:01:54,020  -->  00:01:54,030

82

00:01:54,030  -->  00:01:55,700
coal again those are reclaiming coal and that

83

00:01:55,700  -->  00:01:55,710

84

00:01:55,710  -->  00:01:58,700
is basically how you explain these gaps

85

00:01:58,700  -->  00:01:58,710

86

00:01:58,710  -->  00:02:00,440
and the why they're here and also why this

87

00:02:00,440  -->  00:02:00,450

88

00:02:00,450  -->  00:02:04,429
indicator is here. It has 312 null values,

89

00:02:04,429  -->  00:02:04,439

90

00:02:04,439  -->  00:02:07,609
that is exactly the reason that we don't

91

00:02:07,609  -->  00:02:07,619

92

00:02:07,619  -->  00:02:10,100
have any data for these machines for

93

00:02:10,100  -->  00:02:10,110

94

00:02:10,110  -->  00:02:12,199
those times. So we can now get rid of

95

00:02:12,199  -->  00:02:12,209

96

00:02:12,209  -->  00:02:13,580
this indicator all you have to do

97

00:02:13,580  -->  00:02:13,590

98

00:02:13,590  -->  00:02:15,740
is right click and click hide indicator

99

00:02:15,740  -->  00:02:15,750

100

00:02:15,750  -->  00:02:19,520
so that it is not bothering us anymore.

101

00:02:19,520  -->  00:02:19,530

102

00:02:19,530  -->  00:02:21,619
Okay, so that's great let's say this

103

00:02:21,619  -->  00:02:21,629

104

00:02:21,629  -->  00:02:26,030
worksheet and we'll call it analysis and

105

00:02:26,030  -->  00:02:26,040

106

00:02:26,040  -->  00:02:29,750
so what we have here is that sheet we

107

00:02:29,750  -->  00:02:29,760

108

00:02:29,760  -->  00:02:31,339
don't need anymore let's go ahead and

109

00:02:31,339  -->  00:02:31,349

110

00:02:31,349  -->  00:02:33,259
delete the sheet we don't need this

111

00:02:33,259  -->  00:02:33,269

112

00:02:33,269  -->  00:02:36,020
sheet anymore as well so let's go ahead

113

00:02:36,020  -->  00:02:36,030

114

00:02:36,030  -->  00:02:38,690
and delete that and now let's do some

115

00:02:38,690  -->  00:02:38,700

116

00:02:38,700  -->  00:02:40,490
more testing on our table calculations

117

00:02:40,490  -->  00:02:40,500

118

00:02:40,500  -->  00:02:43,670
so we learn how to create and write our

119

00:02:43,670  -->  00:02:43,680

120

00:02:43,680  -->  00:02:45,979
own table calculations. Very very

121

00:02:45,979  -->  00:02:45,989

122

00:02:45,989  -->  00:02:47,360
powerful skill to have

123

00:02:47,360  -->  00:02:47,370

124

00:02:47,370  -->  00:02:49,580
so right click that and click duplicate

125

00:02:49,580  -->  00:02:49,590

126

00:02:49,590  -->  00:02:52,190
sheets so we can have a copy of it and

127

00:02:52,190  -->  00:02:52,200

128

00:02:52,200  -->  00:02:54,710
we'll just rename this to table calyx

129

00:02:54,710  -->  00:02:54,720

130

00:02:54,720  -->  00:02:58,190
testing two. Alright off we go

131

00:02:58,190  -->  00:02:58,200

132

00:02:58,200  -->  00:03:00,110
what do we have here? We've got our table

133

00:03:00,110  -->  00:03:00,120

134

00:03:00,120  -->  00:03:01,940
calculation at the bottom we've got it here

135

00:03:01,940  -->  00:03:01,950

136

00:03:01,950  -->  00:03:03,319
so let's open it up.

137

00:03:03,319  -->  00:03:03,329

138

00:03:03,329  -->  00:03:05,990
This is a quick table calculation and we've

139

00:03:05,990  -->  00:03:06,000

140

00:03:06,000  -->  00:03:09,110
learned a lot and I mean like a lot a

141

00:03:09,110  -->  00:03:09,120

142

00:03:09,120  -->  00:03:11,330
lot about quick Tableau calculations. We

143

00:03:11,330  -->  00:03:11,340

144

00:03:11,340  -->  00:03:13,819
know how to create them, we know how to

145

00:03:13,819  -->  00:03:13,829

146

00:03:13,829  -->  00:03:15,979
work with them over here, we know how to

147

00:03:15,979  -->  00:03:15,989

148

00:03:15,989  -->  00:03:18,979
select which computation method we want

149

00:03:18,979  -->  00:03:18,989

150

00:03:18,989  -->  00:03:21,800
to use but now the time has come to

151

00:03:21,800  -->  00:03:21,810

152

00:03:21,810  -->  00:03:23,900
actually start writing this calculate

153

00:03:23,900  -->  00:03:23,910

154

00:03:23,910  -->  00:03:26,629
table calculations ourself to start

155

00:03:26,629  -->  00:03:26,639

156

00:03:26,639  -->  00:03:29,059
creating formulas for them. So we've

157

00:03:29,059  -->  00:03:29,069

158

00:03:29,069  -->  00:03:30,890
already started talking about table

159

00:03:30,890  -->  00:03:30,900

160

00:03:30,900  -->  00:03:32,750
calculation formulas and that was when

161

00:03:32,750  -->  00:03:32,760

162

00:03:32,760  -->  00:03:34,670
we looked at this table calculation that

163

00:03:34,670  -->  00:03:34,680

164

00:03:34,680  -->  00:03:36,650
we've saved over here as you can see the

165

00:03:36,650  -->  00:03:36,660

166

00:03:36,660  -->  00:03:38,870
formula was created for us is quite

167

00:03:38,870  -->  00:03:38,880

168

00:03:38,880  -->  00:03:40,940
complex but not worry we're going to

169

00:03:40,940  -->  00:03:40,950

170

00:03:40,950  -->  00:03:43,640
start small we're going to perform baby

171

00:03:43,640  -->  00:03:43,650

172

00:03:43,650  -->  00:03:47,479
steps to get to things like this and

173

00:03:47,479  -->  00:03:47,489

174

00:03:47,489  -->  00:03:49,370
let's create our very first table

175

00:03:49,370  -->  00:03:49,380

176

00:03:49,380  -->  00:03:50,930
calculation. So we're going to start from

177

00:03:50,930  -->  00:03:50,940

178

00:03:50,940  -->  00:03:51,710
scratch

179

00:03:51,710  -->  00:03:51,720

180

00:03:51,720  -->  00:03:53,449
we're going to right-click and will say

181

00:03:53,449  -->  00:03:53,459

182

00:03:53,459  -->  00:03:57,110
create calculated field and here we will

183

00:03:57,110  -->  00:03:57,120

184

00:03:57,120  -->  00:04:01,400
call it let's call it my first table

185

00:04:01,400  -->  00:04:01,410

186

00:04:01,410  -->  00:04:06,140
calculation and here what you want to do

187

00:04:06,140  -->  00:04:06,150

188

00:04:06,150  -->  00:04:07,610
is in the drop-down you want to select

189

00:04:07,610  -->  00:04:07,620

190

00:04:07,620  -->  00:04:10,220
formulas relating to table calculations

191

00:04:10,220  -->  00:04:10,230

192

00:04:10,230  -->  00:04:12,379
so that kind of limits the formulas are

193

00:04:12,379  -->  00:04:12,389

194

00:04:12,389  -->  00:04:13,940
looking at it's very convenient that way

195

00:04:13,940  -->  00:04:13,950

196

00:04:13,950  -->  00:04:16,279
and here they are. So let we're gonna

197

00:04:16,279  -->  00:04:16,289

198

00:04:16,289  -->  00:04:17,750
go through them in this tutorial and

199

00:04:17,750  -->  00:04:17,760

200

00:04:17,760  -->  00:04:19,819
understand the groups of formulas that

201

00:04:19,819  -->  00:04:19,829

202

00:04:19,829  -->  00:04:22,490
you have here and is the top ones are

203

00:04:22,490  -->  00:04:22,500

204

00:04:22,500  -->  00:04:24,080
very easy to start with they are

205

00:04:24,080  -->  00:04:24,090

206

00:04:24,090  -->  00:04:25,880
actually the simpler one so let's go

207

00:04:25,880  -->  00:04:25,890

208

00:04:25,890  -->  00:04:26,550
ahead and start

209

00:04:26,550  -->  00:04:26,560

210

00:04:26,560  -->  00:04:29,400
them. So what we want to do here is we

211

00:04:29,400  -->  00:04:29,410

212

00:04:29,410  -->  00:04:32,820
want to use this formula which is first

213

00:04:32,820  -->  00:04:32,830

214

00:04:32,830  -->  00:04:35,220
and what it does is return the number of

215

00:04:35,220  -->  00:04:35,230

216

00:04:35,230  -->  00:04:37,500
rows from the current role to the first

217

00:04:37,500  -->  00:04:37,510

218

00:04:37,510  -->  00:04:39,629
row in the partition let's go ahead and

219

00:04:39,629  -->  00:04:39,639

220

00:04:39,639  -->  00:04:42,180
just put this formula in here just say

221

00:04:42,180  -->  00:04:42,190

222

00:04:42,190  -->  00:04:45,629
first brackets and nothing else and as

223

00:04:45,629  -->  00:04:45,639

224

00:04:45,639  -->  00:04:49,740
you can see this options up, came up

225

00:04:49,740  -->  00:04:49,750

226

00:04:49,750  -->  00:04:52,290
here and it will allow you to specify

227

00:04:52,290  -->  00:04:52,300

228

00:04:52,300  -->  00:04:54,990
the direction of computation by default

229

00:04:54,990  -->  00:04:55,000

230

00:04:55,000  -->  00:04:58,680
it will normally be automatic so it will

231

00:04:58,680  -->  00:04:58,690

232

00:04:58,690  -->  00:05:02,940
normally go fall back to across and

233

00:05:02,940  -->  00:05:02,950

234

00:05:02,950  -->  00:05:04,530
let's see how that works out so I'll

235

00:05:04,530  -->  00:05:04,540

236

00:05:04,540  -->  00:05:06,840
click ok and we'll take this my first

237

00:05:06,840  -->  00:05:06,850

238

00:05:06,850  -->  00:05:09,030
table calculation and we'll replace it over

239

00:05:09,030  -->  00:05:09,040

240

00:05:09,040  -->  00:05:11,550
here and will also replace it over here

241

00:05:11,550  -->  00:05:11,560

242

00:05:11,560  -->  00:05:13,740
by holding down control. So what you can

243

00:05:13,740  -->  00:05:13,750

244

00:05:13,750  -->  00:05:17,190
see now is 0-1 minus 2 minus 3 minus 4

245

00:05:17,190  -->  00:05:17,200

246

00:05:17,200  -->  00:05:18,780
minus 5 and so on.

247

00:05:18,780  -->  00:05:18,790

248

00:05:18,790  -->  00:05:20,460
What is that? Well it is basically

249

00:05:20,460  -->  00:05:20,470

250

00:05:20,470  -->  00:05:23,580
telling us if this is the first bar

251

00:05:23,580  -->  00:05:23,590

252

00:05:23,590  -->  00:05:26,520
how far away is the every second bar

253

00:05:26,520  -->  00:05:26,530

254

00:05:26,530  -->  00:05:28,650
every next bar so let's go ahead back in

255

00:05:28,650  -->  00:05:28,660

256

00:05:28,660  -->  00:05:32,520
the table calculation. So if we click on

257

00:05:32,520  -->  00:05:32,530

258

00:05:32,530  -->  00:05:34,200
this formula it'll bring up the formula

259

00:05:34,200  -->  00:05:34,210

260

00:05:34,210  -->  00:05:36,570
and says returns a number of rows from

261

00:05:36,570  -->  00:05:36,580

262

00:05:36,580  -->  00:05:38,700
the current row to the first row in the

263

00:05:38,700  -->  00:05:38,710

264

00:05:38,710  -->  00:05:42,180
partition and here it even gives you an

265

00:05:42,180  -->  00:05:42,190

266

00:05:42,190  -->  00:05:44,460
example so as you can see it's negative

267

00:05:44,460  -->  00:05:44,470

268

00:05:44,470  -->  00:05:46,500
and that is because this is the top row

269

00:05:46,500  -->  00:05:46,510

270

00:05:46,510  -->  00:05:48,750
and as you go down through the table,  you

271

00:05:48,750  -->  00:05:48,760

272

00:05:48,760  -->  00:05:51,330
going further away from that row and

273

00:05:51,330  -->  00:05:51,340

274

00:05:51,340  -->  00:05:53,520
therefore that Tableau just works that way

275

00:05:53,520  -->  00:05:53,530

276

00:05:53,530  -->  00:05:56,820
that it's concerning them negative. Alright, let's

277

00:05:56,820  -->  00:05:56,830

278

00:05:56,830  -->  00:05:59,340
fix this up and change table calculation and

279

00:05:59,340  -->  00:05:59,350

280

00:05:59,350  -->  00:06:01,050
it's quite handy that the table

281

00:06:01,050  -->  00:06:01,060

282

00:06:01,060  -->  00:06:02,670
calculations already in there for us.

283

00:06:02,670  -->  00:06:02,680

284

00:06:02,680  -->  00:06:04,710
Let's see what happens with that as well.

285

00:06:04,710  -->  00:06:04,720

286

00:06:04,720  -->  00:06:06,450
So we're going to select Tableau

287

00:06:06,450  -->  00:06:06,460

288

00:06:06,460  -->  00:06:08,820
calculations and let's say index returns

289

00:06:08,820  -->  00:06:08,830

290

00:06:08,830  -->  00:06:10,469
the index of the current row in the

291

00:06:10,469  -->  00:06:10,479

292

00:06:10,479  -->  00:06:12,870
partition that's great let's put this in

293

00:06:12,870  -->  00:06:12,880

294

00:06:12,880  -->  00:06:13,560
here.

295

00:06:13,560  -->  00:06:13,570

296

00:06:13,570  -->  00:06:17,879
Okay, click apply alright so you see that

297

00:06:17,879  -->  00:06:17,889

298

00:06:17,889  -->  00:06:20,010
this time the table calculation has been

299

00:06:20,010  -->  00:06:20,020

300

00:06:20,020  -->  00:06:23,820
adjusted for us as I said you might want

301

00:06:23,820  -->  00:06:23,830

302

00:06:23,830  -->  00:06:26,400
to just drag it in here but if you see

303

00:06:26,400  -->  00:06:26,410

304

00:06:26,410  -->  00:06:28,529
that it has been adjusted for you then

305

00:06:28,529  -->  00:06:28,539

306

00:06:28,539  -->  00:06:30,510
there's no need to do that. So here it's

307

00:06:30,510  -->  00:06:30,520

308

00:06:30,520  -->  00:06:32,310
telling you the index which makes sense

309

00:06:32,310  -->  00:06:32,320

310

00:06:32,320  -->  00:06:34,320
right first second third and so on

311

00:06:34,320  -->  00:06:34,330

312

00:06:34,330  -->  00:06:35,580
let's go ahead and

313

00:06:35,580  -->  00:06:35,590

314

00:06:35,590  -->  00:06:38,190
click edit again index what else do we

315

00:06:38,190  -->  00:06:38,200

316

00:06:38,200  -->  00:06:41,550
have here. Table calculations last.

317

00:06:41,550  -->  00:06:41,560

318

00:06:41,560  -->  00:06:43,260
Well, it's kind of like first so there's

319

00:06:43,260  -->  00:06:43,270

320

00:06:43,270  -->  00:06:45,510
no point in doing that just just

321

00:06:45,510  -->  00:06:45,520

322

00:06:45,520  -->  00:06:47,850
calculates how much to the last row.

323

00:06:47,850  -->  00:06:47,860

324

00:06:47,860  -->  00:06:51,270
Lookup returns the value of the given

325

00:06:51,270  -->  00:06:51,280

326

00:06:51,280  -->  00:06:53,640
expression in the target row specified

327

00:06:53,640  -->  00:06:53,650

328

00:06:53,650  -->  00:06:55,680
as a relative offset from the current

329

00:06:55,680  -->  00:06:55,690

330

00:06:55,690  -->  00:06:58,590
row or you can use first and last to

331

00:06:58,590  -->  00:06:58,600

332

00:06:58,600  -->  00:07:00,840
specify an offset from first and last.

333

00:07:00,840  -->  00:07:00,850

334

00:07:00,850  -->  00:07:03,450
That's interesting let's look at look

335

00:07:03,450  -->  00:07:03,460

336

00:07:03,460  -->  00:07:05,910
up because as you remember lookup was

337

00:07:05,910  -->  00:07:05,920

338

00:07:05,920  -->  00:07:08,040
used you know idle capacity percent

339

00:07:08,040  -->  00:07:08,050

340

00:07:08,050  -->  00:07:10,290
calculation. Let's type it in here

341

00:07:10,290  -->  00:07:10,300

342

00:07:10,300  -->  00:07:14,370
look up and we want, what expression do we

343

00:07:14,370  -->  00:07:14,380

344

00:07:14,380  -->  00:07:19,230
want? Well let's say some of tons and

345

00:07:19,230  -->  00:07:19,240

346

00:07:19,240  -->  00:07:23,100
then we want offset let's say two. So two

347

00:07:23,100  -->  00:07:23,110

348

00:07:23,110  -->  00:07:25,080
bars away from the current one and we'll

349

00:07:25,080  -->  00:07:25,090

350

00:07:25,090  -->  00:07:27,750
click apply and click okay. So what is this

351

00:07:27,750  -->  00:07:27,760

352

00:07:27,760  -->  00:07:30,210
showing us? It's showing us the sum for

353

00:07:30,210  -->  00:07:30,220

354

00:07:30,220  -->  00:07:31,980
tons for two bars away from our

355

00:07:31,980  -->  00:07:31,990

356

00:07:31,990  -->  00:07:33,930
current bar. So there's our current bar

357

00:07:33,930  -->  00:07:33,940

358

00:07:33,940  -->  00:07:36,450
or that that's where we are now and now

359

00:07:36,450  -->  00:07:36,460

360

00:07:36,460  -->  00:07:39,810
two bars away would mean going to the

361

00:07:39,810  -->  00:07:39,820

362

00:07:39,820  -->  00:07:41,190
right going to this bar. So there you go

363

00:07:41,190  -->  00:07:41,200

364

00:07:41,200  -->  00:07:43,260
seven to eight seven to eight and for

365

00:07:43,260  -->  00:07:43,270

366

00:07:43,270  -->  00:07:45,090
this bar it's that bar for this bar it's

367

00:07:45,090  -->  00:07:45,100

368

00:07:45,100  -->  00:07:47,280
that bar and for this bar it's already

369

00:07:47,280  -->  00:07:47,290

370

00:07:47,290  -->  00:07:49,140
that bar. So it's two bars to the right.

371

00:07:49,140  -->  00:07:49,150

372

00:07:49,150  -->  00:07:51,060
That's good so as you can see the whole

373

00:07:51,060  -->  00:07:51,070

374

00:07:51,070  -->  00:07:53,640
chart kind of shifted to the left a

375

00:07:53,640  -->  00:07:53,650

376

00:07:53,650  -->  00:07:55,680
little bit. Right? So it would like from

377

00:07:55,680  -->  00:07:55,690

378

00:07:55,690  -->  00:07:57,390
this chart to this chart shift it to the

379

00:07:57,390  -->  00:07:57,400

380

00:07:57,400  -->  00:07:59,160
left by two bars.

381

00:07:59,160  -->  00:07:59,170

382

00:07:59,170  -->  00:08:01,200
Alright, great and that's now you can see

383

00:08:01,200  -->  00:08:01,210

384

00:08:01,210  -->  00:08:03,240
why the table calculations because you

385

00:08:03,240  -->  00:08:03,250

386

00:08:03,250  -->  00:08:06,930
are referring to rows and all these bars

387

00:08:06,930  -->  00:08:06,940

388

00:08:06,940  -->  00:08:08,580
actually represent rows.

389

00:08:08,580  -->  00:08:08,590

390

00:08:08,590  -->  00:08:10,080
So you're referring to

391

00:08:10,080  -->  00:08:10,090

392

00:08:10,090  -->  00:08:11,760
different rows from this row you're

393

00:08:11,760  -->  00:08:11,770

394

00:08:11,770  -->  00:08:14,280
able to call information from this row

395

00:08:14,280  -->  00:08:14,290

396

00:08:14,290  -->  00:08:16,860
from this row from row number four from

397

00:08:16,860  -->  00:08:16,870

398

00:08:16,870  -->  00:08:19,590
day number 4 you're able to call

399

00:08:19,590  -->  00:08:19,600

400

00:08:19,600  -->  00:08:22,230
information for a day number six which

401

00:08:22,230  -->  00:08:22,240

402

00:08:22,240  -->  00:08:24,420
is a separate row in this aggregated

403

00:08:24,420  -->  00:08:24,430

404

00:08:24,430  -->  00:08:28,770
table. So now if we go back to our table

405

00:08:28,770  -->  00:08:28,780

406

00:08:28,780  -->  00:08:31,530
calculation. We'll click Edit and let's look

407

00:08:31,530  -->  00:08:31,540

408

00:08:31,540  -->  00:08:33,930
at another one where our table

409

00:08:33,930  -->  00:08:33,940

410

00:08:33,940  -->  00:08:34,830
calculations.

411

00:08:34,830  -->  00:08:34,840

412

00:08:34,840  -->  00:08:38,040
Alright, so we did look up previous value

413

00:08:38,040  -->  00:08:38,050

414

00:08:38,050  -->  00:08:41,640
so it's pretty much just look at the

415

00:08:41,640  -->  00:08:41,650

416

00:08:41,650  -->  00:08:43,470
previous value nothing nothing special

417

00:08:43,470  -->  00:08:43,480

418

00:08:43,480  -->  00:08:46,590
there. Rank, so rank is also quick table

419

00:08:46,590  -->  00:08:46,600

420

00:08:46,600  -->  00:08:48,680
calculation you can find it there

421

00:08:48,680  -->  00:08:48,690

422

00:08:48,690  -->  00:08:52,370
it will tell you how this result. How this

423

00:08:52,370  -->  00:08:52,380

424

00:08:52,380  -->  00:08:56,120
specific row or row in your

425

00:08:56,120  -->  00:08:56,130

426

00:08:56,130  -->  00:08:58,100
aggregated table. Remember that table

427

00:08:58,100  -->  00:08:58,110

428

00:08:58,110  -->  00:08:59,450
calculations always remember this a

429

00:08:59,450  -->  00:08:59,460

430

00:08:59,460  -->  00:09:02,120
table calculations are working or being

431

00:09:02,120  -->  00:09:02,130

432

00:09:02,130  -->  00:09:04,340
calculated on an aggregated level. So

433

00:09:04,340  -->  00:09:04,350

434

00:09:04,350  -->  00:09:05,600
once your data has been aggregated

435

00:09:05,600  -->  00:09:05,610

436

00:09:05,610  -->  00:09:08,000
for this view then only the table

437

00:09:08,000  -->  00:09:08,010

438

00:09:08,010  -->  00:09:10,100
calculations are applied after that. So,

439

00:09:10,100  -->  00:09:10,110

440

00:09:10,110  -->  00:09:11,810
basically what rank will tell you how

441

00:09:11,810  -->  00:09:11,820

442

00:09:11,820  -->  00:09:15,890
does your aggregated row rank among all

443

00:09:15,890  -->  00:09:15,900

444

00:09:15,900  -->  00:09:17,810
other rows that you want to search among?

445

00:09:17,810  -->  00:09:17,820

446

00:09:17,820  -->  00:09:19,580
But we're not gonna go about talk about

447

00:09:19,580  -->  00:09:19,590

448

00:09:19,590  -->  00:09:22,250
rank right now running average these are

449

00:09:22,250  -->  00:09:22,260

450

00:09:22,260  -->  00:09:24,920
good ones. So running average, I never

451

00:09:24,920  -->  00:09:24,930

452

00:09:24,930  -->  00:09:26,770
understood that. Let's start with running

453

00:09:26,780  -->  00:09:26,790

454

00:09:26,790  -->  00:09:29,830
running a sum, right? So running sum, you

455

00:09:29,840  -->  00:09:29,850

456

00:09:29,850  -->  00:09:31,130
should be familiar of running sum

457

00:09:31,130  -->  00:09:31,140

458

00:09:31,140  -->  00:09:36,050
running some there it is. So running sum

459

00:09:36,050  -->  00:09:36,060

460

00:09:36,060  -->  00:09:41,150
of some tons right or and remember is so

461

00:09:41,150  -->  00:09:41,160

462

00:09:41,160  -->  00:09:43,460
if I specify just tons here, what am I

463

00:09:43,460  -->  00:09:43,470

464

00:09:43,470  -->  00:09:45,440
going to get? I'm going to get an error

465

00:09:45,440  -->  00:09:45,450

466

00:09:45,450  -->  00:09:47,300
why is that? Well because you can't say

467

00:09:47,300  -->  00:09:47,310

468

00:09:47,310  -->  00:09:49,970
running sum of tons is not being

469

00:09:49,970  -->  00:09:49,980

470

00:09:49,980  -->  00:09:54,140
calculated at the level of the data it's

471

00:09:54,140  -->  00:09:54,150

472

00:09:54,150  -->  00:09:56,030
not being calculated every single row

473

00:09:56,030  -->  00:09:56,040

474

00:09:56,040  -->  00:09:57,440
is having a data, is being calculated

475

00:09:57,440  -->  00:09:57,450

476

00:09:57,450  -->  00:10:00,770
at this aggregated level so at this new

477

00:10:00,770  -->  00:10:00,780

478

00:10:00,780  -->  00:10:02,960
table which is an aggregated table and

479

00:10:02,960  -->  00:10:02,970

480

00:10:02,970  -->  00:10:04,910
in order the aggregated table doesn't

481

00:10:04,910  -->  00:10:04,920

482

00:10:04,920  -->  00:10:06,710
have tons. The aggregated table only has

483

00:10:06,710  -->  00:10:06,720

484

00:10:06,720  -->  00:10:08,900
aggregate values and aggregated valves

485

00:10:08,900  -->  00:10:08,910

486

00:10:08,910  -->  00:10:11,210
are like some of tons, so let's let's

487

00:10:11,210  -->  00:10:11,220

488

00:10:11,220  -->  00:10:14,210
let's drive this point home. This sum of

489

00:10:14,210  -->  00:10:14,220

490

00:10:14,220  -->  00:10:16,850
tons is what you see here right?

491

00:10:16,850  -->  00:10:16,860

492

00:10:16,860  -->  00:10:18,950
So there you go, those are sum of tons.

493

00:10:18,950  -->  00:10:18,960

494

00:10:18,960  -->  00:10:20,450
Now you want to apply a table

495

00:10:20,450  -->  00:10:20,460

496

00:10:20,460  -->  00:10:23,120
calculation to those sums of tons right?

497

00:10:23,120  -->  00:10:23,130

498

00:10:23,130  -->  00:10:26,060
So on top of your aggregated table.

499

00:10:26,060  -->  00:10:26,070

500

00:10:26,070  -->  00:10:27,980
That's very important to understand,

501

00:10:27,980  -->  00:10:27,990

502

00:10:27,990  -->  00:10:30,080
that's how table calculations work. So I

503

00:10:30,080  -->  00:10:30,090

504

00:10:30,090  -->  00:10:31,760
want the running sum, sum of tons

505

00:10:31,760  -->  00:10:31,770

506

00:10:31,770  -->  00:10:35,060
click ok and this is exactly what we saw

507

00:10:35,060  -->  00:10:35,070

508

00:10:35,070  -->  00:10:37,520
previously remember when we did an area

509

00:10:37,520  -->  00:10:37,530

510

00:10:37,530  -->  00:10:39,890
chart feels like so long ago doesn't it?

511

00:10:39,890  -->  00:10:39,900

512

00:10:39,900  -->  00:10:41,870
We've learned so much and had so many

513

00:10:41,870  -->  00:10:41,880

514

00:10:41,880  -->  00:10:43,790
tutorials but that isn't that is a good

515

00:10:43,790  -->  00:10:43,800

516

00:10:43,800  -->  00:10:45,650
thing that means that we're going we're

517

00:10:45,650  -->  00:10:45,660

518

00:10:45,660  -->  00:10:47,450
being very thorough with these table

519

00:10:47,450  -->  00:10:47,460

520

00:10:47,460  -->  00:10:48,650
calculations and by the end of this

521

00:10:48,650  -->  00:10:48,660

522

00:10:48,660  -->  00:10:51,230
section you know pretty much everything

523

00:10:51,230  -->  00:10:51,240

524

00:10:51,240  -->  00:10:53,300
or at least eighty percent of what there

525

00:10:53,300  -->  00:10:53,310

526

00:10:53,310  -->  00:10:55,460
is to know about table calculations.

527

00:10:55,460  -->  00:10:55,470

528

00:10:55,470  -->  00:10:58,160
Alright, so we basically recreated the

529

00:10:58,160  -->  00:10:58,170

530

00:10:58,170  -->  00:11:00,079
quick table calculations for

531

00:11:00,079  -->  00:11:00,089

532

00:11:00,089  -->  00:11:03,019
running total and that was as simple as

533

00:11:03,019  -->  00:11:03,029

534

00:11:03,029  -->  00:11:05,150
using one for now. So let's go back into

535

00:11:05,150  -->  00:11:05,160

536

00:11:05,160  -->  00:11:08,179
our oops, wrong one.

537

00:11:08,179  -->  00:11:08,189

538

00:11:08,189  -->  00:11:10,639
There is my first table calculation, edit,

539

00:11:10,639  -->  00:11:10,649

540

00:11:10,649  -->  00:11:13,160
ok running sum what are the table

541

00:11:13,160  -->  00:11:13,170

542

00:11:13,170  -->  00:11:15,319
calculations that we have? Oh I promise to

543

00:11:15,319  -->  00:11:15,329

544

00:11:15,329  -->  00:11:17,239
talk a little bit about running average,

545

00:11:17,239  -->  00:11:17,249

546

00:11:17,249  -->  00:11:19,519
never understood that like why would you

547

00:11:19,519  -->  00:11:19,529

548

00:11:19,529  -->  00:11:20,929
want a running average like a moving

549

00:11:20,929  -->  00:11:20,939

550

00:11:20,939  -->  00:11:24,350
average is one thing or moving

551

00:11:24,350  -->  00:11:24,360

552

00:11:24,360  -->  00:11:25,040
average

553

00:11:25,040  -->  00:11:25,050

554

00:11:25,050  -->  00:11:27,049
where was it? We'll get to it in a second

555

00:11:27,049  -->  00:11:27,059

556

00:11:27,059  -->  00:11:29,480
but a running average, the way it's

557

00:11:29,480  -->  00:11:29,490

558

00:11:29,490  -->  00:11:32,929
defined here is in Tableau is returns are

559

00:11:32,929  -->  00:11:32,939

560

00:11:32,939  -->  00:11:34,340
running average of the given expression

561

00:11:34,340  -->  00:11:34,350

562

00:11:34,350  -->  00:11:36,439
for the first row in the program from

563

00:11:36,439  -->  00:11:36,449

564

00:11:36,449  -->  00:11:38,030
the first row in position to the current

565

00:11:38,030  -->  00:11:38,040

566

00:11:38,040  -->  00:11:39,530
also you can't control where it starts.

567

00:11:39,530  -->  00:11:39,540

568

00:11:39,540  -->  00:11:40,999
It will always start at the first row so

569

00:11:40,999  -->  00:11:41,009

570

00:11:41,009  -->  00:11:43,369
all these running functions they start

571

00:11:43,369  -->  00:11:43,379

572

00:11:43,379  -->  00:11:45,829
at the first row and up to the control.

573

00:11:45,829  -->  00:11:45,839

574

00:11:45,839  -->  00:11:47,179
So i'll show you the running average

575

00:11:47,179  -->  00:11:47,189

576

00:11:47,189  -->  00:11:49,040
just just for fun.

577

00:11:49,040  -->  00:11:49,050

578

00:11:49,050  -->  00:11:50,869
You'll see what it what it looks like so

579

00:11:50,869  -->  00:11:50,879

580

00:11:50,879  -->  00:11:54,980
click OK and always we talked averages

581

00:11:54,980  -->  00:11:54,990

582

00:11:54,990  -->  00:11:57,530
of representatives as line. This average it

583

00:11:57,530  -->  00:11:57,540

584

00:11:57,540  -->  00:12:00,379
because the further you go the more rows

585

00:12:00,379  -->  00:12:00,389

586

00:12:00,389  -->  00:12:02,449
that it includes right? So from here, we'll

587

00:12:02,449  -->  00:12:02,459

588

00:12:02,459  -->  00:12:04,309
include all of those rows from here

589

00:12:04,309  -->  00:12:04,319

590

00:12:04,319  -->  00:12:06,019
include all those rows from here we

591

00:12:06,019  -->  00:12:06,029

592

00:12:06,029  -->  00:12:07,759
could all rows. As you go further down,

593

00:12:07,759  -->  00:12:07,769

594

00:12:07,769  -->  00:12:09,949
its kind of stabilizes so all of these

595

00:12:09,949  -->  00:12:09,959

596

00:12:09,959  -->  00:12:12,650
if you even get bars that are like out

597

00:12:12,650  -->  00:12:12,660

598

00:12:12,660  -->  00:12:13,610
of the norm,

599

00:12:13,610  -->  00:12:13,620

600

00:12:13,620  -->  00:12:15,139
they won't they'll have less and less

601

00:12:15,139  -->  00:12:15,149

602

00:12:15,149  -->  00:12:17,059
impact as you go to the right.

603

00:12:17,059  -->  00:12:17,069

604

00:12:17,069  -->  00:12:19,340
Very rare you would apply something like

605

00:12:19,340  -->  00:12:19,350

606

00:12:19,350  -->  00:12:21,049
this. It has very limited scope of

607

00:12:21,049  -->  00:12:21,059

608

00:12:21,059  -->  00:12:21,860
applications.

609

00:12:21,860  -->  00:12:21,870

610

00:12:21,870  -->  00:12:24,350
Maybe in some specific kind of research

611

00:12:24,350  -->  00:12:24,360

612

00:12:24,360  -->  00:12:26,960
or specific industry task where you know

613

00:12:26,960  -->  00:12:26,970

614

00:12:26,970  -->  00:12:28,759
you're running average, otherwise it's

615

00:12:28,759  -->  00:12:28,769

616

00:12:28,769  -->  00:12:29,929
not something that you would be using

617

00:12:29,929  -->  00:12:29,939

618

00:12:29,939  -->  00:12:31,280
very often.

619

00:12:31,280  -->  00:12:31,290

620

00:12:31,290  -->  00:12:33,379
Alright let's go back in here my first

621

00:12:33,379  -->  00:12:33,389

622

00:12:33,389  -->  00:12:34,850
table calculation, so that's the running

623

00:12:34,850  -->  00:12:34,860

624

00:12:34,860  -->  00:12:38,239
average what else do we have running

625

00:12:38,239  -->  00:12:38,249

626

00:12:38,249  -->  00:12:40,970
average running count so runnings make

627

00:12:40,970  -->  00:12:40,980

628

00:12:40,980  -->  00:12:41,960
sense right?

629

00:12:41,960  -->  00:12:41,970

630

00:12:41,970  -->  00:12:43,489
Running counts basic accounting records

631

00:12:43,489  -->  00:12:43,499

632

00:12:43,499  -->  00:12:45,559
up to the current one that's probably a

633

00:12:45,559  -->  00:12:45,569

634

00:12:45,569  -->  00:12:48,079
good one to have a look at what I did

635

00:12:48,079  -->  00:12:48,089

636

00:12:48,089  -->  00:12:50,600
there is I double-clicked it.

637

00:12:50,600  -->  00:12:50,610

638

00:12:50,610  -->  00:12:54,499
There we go so that's better, so if you

639

00:12:54,499  -->  00:12:54,509

640

00:12:54,509  -->  00:12:56,059
that good

641

00:12:56,059  -->  00:12:56,069

642

00:12:56,069  -->  00:13:00,949
okay I think I lost I have an extra one

643

00:13:00,949  -->  00:13:00,959

644

00:13:00,959  -->  00:13:03,319
there extra racket, so running count is

645

00:13:03,319  -->  00:13:03,329

646

00:13:03,329  -->  00:13:05,329
basically number of records as it

647

00:13:05,329  -->  00:13:05,339

648

00:13:05,339  -->  00:13:07,280
increases. Alright so we're done with the

649

00:13:07,280  -->  00:13:07,290

650

00:13:07,290  -->  00:13:09,259
running ones. Let's move on to something

651

00:13:09,259  -->  00:13:09,269

652

00:13:09,269  -->  00:13:11,490
more interesting.

653

00:13:11,490  -->  00:13:11,500

654

00:13:11,500  -->  00:13:15,270
So script pool, we won't be talking about

655

00:13:15,270  -->  00:13:15,280

656

00:13:15,280  -->  00:13:16,830
this but all the ones that start with

657

00:13:16,830  -->  00:13:16,840

658

00:13:16,840  -->  00:13:19,320
script they're basically that allow you

659

00:13:19,320  -->  00:13:19,330

660

00:13:19,330  -->  00:13:21,480
to integrate R with Tableau. There's a

661

00:13:21,480  -->  00:13:21,490

662

00:13:21,490  -->  00:13:23,130
few more steps that you have to take

663

00:13:23,130  -->  00:13:23,140

664

00:13:23,140  -->  00:13:26,430
conduct, you have to load up a package

665

00:13:26,430  -->  00:13:26,440

666

00:13:26,440  -->  00:13:30,120
and R, you have to execute it like like

667

00:13:30,120  -->  00:13:30,130

668

00:13:30,130  -->  00:13:31,680
you have to set up your computer or your

669

00:13:31,680  -->  00:13:31,690

670

00:13:31,690  -->  00:13:35,130
server for in order to be able to work

671

00:13:35,130  -->  00:13:35,140

672

00:13:35,140  -->  00:13:37,170
with Tableau with R. But we're not going

673

00:13:37,170  -->  00:13:37,180

674

00:13:37,180  -->  00:13:38,730
to be worried about that right? Now we're

675

00:13:38,730  -->  00:13:38,740

676

00:13:38,740  -->  00:13:41,280
just going to continue of the rest

677

00:13:41,280  -->  00:13:41,290

678

00:13:41,290  -->  00:13:45,030
size so tell you how many rows they are

679

00:13:45,030  -->  00:13:45,040

680

00:13:45,040  -->  00:13:48,690
in your partition so it doesn't really

681

00:13:48,690  -->  00:13:48,700

682

00:13:48,700  -->  00:13:52,830
matter. So total, it gives you the total

683

00:13:52,830  -->  00:13:52,840

684

00:13:52,840  -->  00:13:55,620
so it kind of gives you the total for

685

00:13:55,620  -->  00:13:55,630

686

00:13:55,630  -->  00:13:58,770
all everything that you see so if we say

687

00:13:58,770  -->  00:13:58,780

688

00:13:58,780  -->  00:14:04,170
here total and we click OK you'll see

689

00:14:04,170  -->  00:14:04,180

690

00:14:04,180  -->  00:14:06,630
that the number is always the same

691

00:14:06,630  -->  00:14:06,640

692

00:14:06,640  -->  00:14:10,530
because it is it's just a total you can

693

00:14:10,530  -->  00:14:10,540

694

00:14:10,540  -->  00:14:11,940
you can just visualize it as one number.

695

00:14:11,940  -->  00:14:11,950

696

00:14:11,950  -->  00:14:14,520
Its total of this sum, so it's basically

697

00:14:14,520  -->  00:14:14,530

698

00:14:14,530  -->  00:14:17,970
the sum all this sum and it is 25

699

00:14:17,970  -->  00:14:17,980

700

00:14:17,980  -->  00:14:23,100
million tons in this case and alright,

701

00:14:23,100  -->  00:14:23,110

702

00:14:23,110  -->  00:14:26,070
so now let's move on to the

703

00:14:26,070  -->  00:14:26,080

704

00:14:26,080  -->  00:14:30,000
finally the fun ones at the end table

705

00:14:30,000  -->  00:14:30,010

706

00:14:30,010  -->  00:14:31,410
calculation.

707

00:14:31,410  -->  00:14:31,420

708

00:14:31,420  -->  00:14:33,660
Alright so here you see window and

709

00:14:33,660  -->  00:14:33,670

710

00:14:33,670  -->  00:14:37,290
window is often misinterpreted. Window

711

00:14:37,290  -->  00:14:37,300

712

00:14:37,300  -->  00:14:39,810
doesn't mean so let's let's look at one

713

00:14:39,810  -->  00:14:39,820

714

00:14:39,820  -->  00:14:43,050
let's look at window average right? Let's

715

00:14:43,050  -->  00:14:43,060

716

00:14:43,060  -->  00:14:47,430
replace this with window average, what is

717

00:14:47,430  -->  00:14:47,440

718

00:14:47,440  -->  00:14:50,400
window average do? Where is it?

719

00:14:50,400  -->  00:14:50,410

720

00:14:50,410  -->  00:14:52,500
There it is, so returns the average of the

721

00:14:52,500  -->  00:14:52,510

722

00:14:52,510  -->  00:14:55,020
expression within the window and window

723

00:14:55,020  -->  00:14:55,030

724

00:14:55,030  -->  00:14:57,240
is often confused and I was guilty of

725

00:14:57,240  -->  00:14:57,250

726

00:14:57,250  -->  00:14:59,070
this myself. When I was first starting with

727

00:14:59,070  -->  00:14:59,080

728

00:14:59,080  -->  00:15:01,440
Tableau, it's not the window that you're

729

00:15:01,440  -->  00:15:01,450

730

00:15:01,450  -->  00:15:03,360
looking at. It's not this window of

731

00:15:03,360  -->  00:15:03,370

732

00:15:03,370  -->  00:15:06,510
Tableau. It's not the window of your tab.

733

00:15:06,510  -->  00:15:06,520

734

00:15:06,520  -->  00:15:08,790
It's actually the window that you

735

00:15:08,790  -->  00:15:08,800

736

00:15:08,800  -->  00:15:10,470
specify so it's it's kind of like an

737

00:15:10,470  -->  00:15:10,480

738

00:15:10,480  -->  00:15:14,850
interval or a subset of your

739

00:15:14,850  -->  00:15:14,860

740

00:15:14,860  -->  00:15:17,130
rows that you want to work with. That's

741

00:15:17,130  -->  00:15:17,140

742

00:15:17,140  -->  00:15:19,620
all it says, so window is a subset overall.

743

00:15:19,620  -->  00:15:19,630

744

00:15:19,630  -->  00:15:21,420
So the window is defined as an offset

745

00:15:21,420  -->  00:15:21,430

746

00:15:21,430  -->  00:15:24,030
from the current row or you can offset

747

00:15:24,030  -->  00:15:24,040

748

00:15:24,040  -->  00:15:26,700
from the first and last rows. It started

749

00:15:26,700  -->  00:15:26,710

750

00:15:26,710  -->  00:15:28,170
and omitted the entire petition is just.

751

00:15:28,170  -->  00:15:28,180

752

00:15:28,180  -->  00:15:31,890
So let's say we want the window average

753

00:15:31,890  -->  00:15:31,900

754

00:15:31,900  -->  00:15:34,590
and let's say we don't want a window.

755

00:15:34,590  -->  00:15:34,600

756

00:15:34,600  -->  00:15:36,300
We'll just say the whole partition if you

757

00:15:36,300  -->  00:15:36,310

758

00:15:36,310  -->  00:15:38,100
leave it like this what will happen is

759

00:15:38,100  -->  00:15:38,110

760

00:15:38,110  -->  00:15:40,500
it will calculate the average for the

761

00:15:40,500  -->  00:15:40,510

762

00:15:40,510  -->  00:15:41,700
whole partition as you can see the

763

00:15:41,700  -->  00:15:41,710

764

00:15:41,710  -->  00:15:44,010
values same for every single bar. It is

765

00:15:44,010  -->  00:15:44,020

766

00:15:44,020  -->  00:15:47,430
847,625. So it's the average of the sums

767

00:15:47,430  -->  00:15:47,440

768

00:15:47,440  -->  00:15:48,960
or the average of the values you see

769

00:15:48,960  -->  00:15:48,970

770

00:15:48,970  -->  00:15:51,030
here. Now let's go ahead and change it

771

00:15:51,030  -->  00:15:51,040

772

00:15:51,040  -->  00:15:56,490
again and it's alright so window average

773

00:15:56,490  -->  00:15:56,500

774

00:15:56,500  -->  00:15:59,070
but now let's say I want the average for

775

00:15:59,070  -->  00:15:59,080

776

00:15:59,080  -->  00:16:01,470
a certain number of all bars relative to

777

00:16:01,470  -->  00:16:01,480

778

00:16:01,480  -->  00:16:05,880
the current bar. So sum tons minus 20, so

779

00:16:05,880  -->  00:16:05,890

780

00:16:05,890  -->  00:16:07,050
let's use the same example they have

781

00:16:07,050  -->  00:16:07,060

782

00:16:07,060  -->  00:16:10,050
here. So minus two is where I want to

783

00:16:10,050  -->  00:16:10,060

784

00:16:10,060  -->  00:16:12,090
start to two bars to the left of the

785

00:16:12,090  -->  00:16:12,100

786

00:16:12,100  -->  00:16:13,800
current one or two rows before the

787

00:16:13,800  -->  00:16:13,810

788

00:16:13,810  -->  00:16:16,050
current one and I want to end at the

789

00:16:16,050  -->  00:16:16,060

790

00:16:16,060  -->  00:16:19,260
final row so the current one so that

791

00:16:19,260  -->  00:16:19,270

792

00:16:19,270  -->  00:16:21,720
internals three rows 2 to the left and

793

00:16:21,720  -->  00:16:21,730

794

00:16:21,730  -->  00:16:24,060
then include the current one, click ok

795

00:16:24,060  -->  00:16:24,070

796

00:16:24,070  -->  00:16:27,450
and what does that remind us of. That

797

00:16:27,450  -->  00:16:27,460

798

00:16:27,460  -->  00:16:30,360
reminds us a lot of the moving average,

799

00:16:30,360  -->  00:16:30,370

800

00:16:30,370  -->  00:16:32,550
because it is the moving average. So what

801

00:16:32,550  -->  00:16:32,560

802

00:16:32,560  -->  00:16:34,860
are we doing here, we saying what is the

803

00:16:34,860  -->  00:16:34,870

804

00:16:34,870  -->  00:16:37,710
average for the window which is

805

00:16:37,710  -->  00:16:37,720

806

00:16:37,720  -->  00:16:39,870
construction of these three bars? So 520

807

00:16:39,870  -->  00:16:39,880

808

00:16:39,880  -->  00:16:42,480
plus 515 plus 518, if you take the

809

00:16:42,480  -->  00:16:42,490

810

00:16:42,490  -->  00:16:44,340
average of those three you'll get

811

00:16:44,340  -->  00:16:44,350

812

00:16:44,350  -->  00:16:47,070
517,661 and you you can check that on your

813

00:16:47,070  -->  00:16:47,080

814

00:16:47,080  -->  00:16:49,830
calculator if you like and then what is

815

00:16:49,830  -->  00:16:49,840

816

00:16:49,840  -->  00:16:51,810
going on in the next one over here, what

817

00:16:51,810  -->  00:16:51,820

818

00:16:51,820  -->  00:16:53,640
is that? That is the average for this

819

00:16:53,640  -->  00:16:53,650

820

00:16:53,650  -->  00:16:55,380
window. You see that's that's called a

821

00:16:55,380  -->  00:16:55,390

822

00:16:55,390  -->  00:16:58,740
window then this one is average for two

823

00:16:58,740  -->  00:16:58,750

824

00:16:58,750  -->  00:17:00,570
to the left and the current one for this

825

00:17:00,570  -->  00:17:00,580

826

00:17:00,580  -->  00:17:01,290
window.

827

00:17:01,290  -->  00:17:01,300

828

00:17:01,300  -->  00:17:04,200
This is average for this window and that

829

00:17:04,200  -->  00:17:04,210

830

00:17:04,210  -->  00:17:06,420
is how a moving average works and that

831

00:17:06,420  -->  00:17:06,430

832

00:17:06,430  -->  00:17:08,250
is why it's called a moving average

833

00:17:08,250  -->  00:17:08,260

834

00:17:08,260  -->  00:17:10,710
because as you move through your

835

00:17:10,710  -->  00:17:10,720

836

00:17:10,720  -->  00:17:12,300
data set as you move through your

837

00:17:12,300  -->  00:17:12,310

838

00:17:12,310  -->  00:17:14,790
timeline it moves with you, so let me go

839

00:17:14,790  -->  00:17:14,800

840

00:17:14,800  -->  00:17:16,860
ahead and change that quickly so if I

841

00:17:16,860  -->  00:17:16,870

842

00:17:16,870  -->  00:17:19,590
want to change this from let's say I

843

00:17:19,590  -->  00:17:19,600

844

00:17:19,600  -->  00:17:21,420
don't want to get to be a minus 2

845

00:17:21,420  -->  00:17:21,430

846

00:17:21,430  -->  00:17:24,000
anymore I wanted to be a minus 7, so 7

847

00:17:24,000  -->  00:17:24,010

848

00:17:24,010  -->  00:17:25,860
bars to the left and then include the

849

00:17:25,860  -->  00:17:25,870

850

00:17:25,870  -->  00:17:27,300
current bar as well.

851

00:17:27,300  -->  00:17:27,310

852

00:17:27,310  -->  00:17:29,100
What is that doing? So let's take this

853

00:17:29,100  -->  00:17:29,110

854

00:17:29,110  -->  00:17:31,050
one for example what it's saying is take

855

00:17:31,050  -->  00:17:31,060

856

00:17:31,060  -->  00:17:33,300
this current bar and seven bars left

857

00:17:33,300  -->  00:17:33,310

858

00:17:33,310  -->  00:17:37,170
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 so if you take seven bars and

859

00:17:37,170  -->  00:17:37,180

860

00:17:37,180  -->  00:17:39,540
include this one that is your window and

861

00:17:39,540  -->  00:17:39,550

862

00:17:39,550  -->  00:17:43,830
that 728,520 is the average for those

863

00:17:43,830  -->  00:17:43,840

864

00:17:43,840  -->  00:17:46,710
bars or for those rows. Now if I take

865

00:17:46,710  -->  00:17:46,720

866

00:17:46,720  -->  00:17:50,070
this one or let's say this one then the

867

00:17:50,070  -->  00:17:50,080

868

00:17:50,080  -->  00:17:52,830
window for this one is these eight bars

869

00:17:52,830  -->  00:17:52,840

870

00:17:52,840  -->  00:17:58,440
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and the value here is 728,949.

871

00:17:58,440  -->  00:17:58,450

872

00:17:58,450  -->  00:18:01,260
So as you can see, as you move along your

873

00:18:01,260  -->  00:18:01,270

874

00:18:01,270  -->  00:18:03,630
window moves with you. You move window

875

00:18:03,630  -->  00:18:03,640

876

00:18:03,640  -->  00:18:04,800
keeps moving and that's why it's called

877

00:18:04,800  -->  00:18:04,810

878

00:18:04,810  -->  00:18:07,380
a moving average. So average of those

879

00:18:07,380  -->  00:18:07,390

880

00:18:07,390  -->  00:18:09,630
gets goes over there, average of those

881

00:18:09,630  -->  00:18:09,640

882

00:18:09,640  -->  00:18:11,790
goes over there and you can you also

883

00:18:11,790  -->  00:18:11,800

884

00:18:11,800  -->  00:18:13,740
have a moving average here in your table

885

00:18:13,740  -->  00:18:13,750

886

00:18:13,750  -->  00:18:17,520
calculations. So edit table calculation

887

00:18:17,520  -->  00:18:17,530

888

00:18:17,530  -->  00:18:20,820
or basically if you want to add we can't

889

00:18:20,820  -->  00:18:20,830

890

00:18:20,830  -->  00:18:22,290
edit that one. If you want to add it,

891

00:18:22,290  -->  00:18:22,300

892

00:18:22,300  -->  00:18:23,790
table calculation, quick table

893

00:18:23,790  -->  00:18:23,800

894

00:18:23,800  -->  00:18:25,470
calculation you, you do have a moving

895

00:18:25,470  -->  00:18:25,480

896

00:18:25,480  -->  00:18:28,020
average here but we did right now is we

897

00:18:28,020  -->  00:18:28,030

898

00:18:28,030  -->  00:18:29,970
recreated the table calculation.

899

00:18:29,970  -->  00:18:29,980

900

00:18:29,980  -->  00:18:31,980
Ok so this has been a very long tutorial.

901

00:18:31,980  -->  00:18:31,990

902

00:18:31,990  -->  00:18:35,850
We're getting to the end of it.

903

00:18:35,850  -->  00:18:35,860

904

00:18:35,860  -->  00:18:38,640
Those are table calculation functions. I

905

00:18:38,640  -->  00:18:38,650

906

00:18:38,650  -->  00:18:40,890
hope this is useful and now you know how

907

00:18:40,890  -->  00:18:40,900

908

00:18:40,900  -->  00:18:43,500
to create basic table calculations are

909

00:18:43,500  -->  00:18:43,510

910

00:18:43,510  -->  00:18:44,850
right formulas for them.

911

00:18:44,850  -->  00:18:44,860

912

00:18:44,860  -->  00:18:46,530
What we'll do in the next tutorial is we

913

00:18:46,530  -->  00:18:46,540

914

00:18:46,540  -->  00:18:49,710
will finally start applying all these

915

00:18:49,710  -->  00:18:49,720

916

00:18:49,720  -->  00:18:51,690
skills and knowledge we've learned to

917

00:18:51,690  -->  00:18:51,700

918

00:18:51,700  -->  00:18:55,020
our visualization to resolve the

919

00:18:55,020  -->  00:18:55,030

920

00:18:55,030  -->  00:18:57,210
challenge to find the answer to the

921

00:18:57,210  -->  00:18:57,220

922

00:18:57,220  -->  00:18:59,490
question that has been posted and I look

923

00:18:59,490  -->  00:18:59,500

924

00:18:59,500  -->  00:19:00,420
forward to seeing you in the next

925

00:19:00,420  -->  00:19:00,430

926

00:19:00,430  -->  00:19:00,990
tutorial.

927

00:19:00,990  -->  00:19:01,000

928

00:19:01,000  -->  00:19:07,680
Until then, happy Analyzing.
