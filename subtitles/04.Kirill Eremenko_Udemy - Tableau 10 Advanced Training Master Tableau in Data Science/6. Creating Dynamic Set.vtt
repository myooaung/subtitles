00:00:03.200  -->  00:00:07.130
Welcome back to the advanced course on

2

00:00:07.130  -->  00:00:09.290
Tableau and today we're talking about

3

00:00:09.290  -->  00:00:12.919
dynamic sets and we already discussed

4

00:00:12.919  -->  00:00:14.599
that static sets have the disadvantage

5

00:00:14.599  -->  00:00:17.570
that they are hard-coded and they cannot

6

00:00:17.570  -->  00:00:19.610
adjust as our data changes and they

7

00:00:19.610  -->  00:00:22.520
cannot adjust as the conditions of our

8

00:00:22.520  -->  00:00:25.880
analysis change. But dynamic sets don't

9

00:00:25.880  -->  00:00:27.530
have the disadvantage, so let's go ahead

10

00:00:27.530  -->  00:00:31.700
and create this same set but for the top

11

00:00:31.700  -->  00:00:33.860
10 startups but we'll make it a dynamic

12

00:00:33.860  -->  00:00:35.570
one. So we're going to go back to the

13

00:00:35.570  -->  00:00:39.050
growth tab that we have here and as you

14

00:00:39.050  -->  00:00:41.120
recall when we created the statics set,

15

00:00:41.120  -->  00:00:44.750
we selected the categories that we want

16

00:00:44.750  -->  00:00:47.540
or the names of the companies and we

17

00:00:47.540  -->  00:00:49.640
created click this button create set

18

00:00:49.640  -->  00:00:50.329
over here.

19

00:00:50.329  -->  00:00:52.310
Well if you want to create a dynamic set

20

00:00:52.310  -->  00:00:56.149
you can't create it from the visual itself.

21

00:00:56.149  -->  00:00:59.660
You have to go through the field name so

22

00:00:59.660  -->  00:01:02.420
let's go ahead and do that. First, we need

23

00:01:02.420  -->  00:01:04.820
to identify the dimension we're going to

24

00:01:04.820  -->  00:01:06.350
create the set form and let's create

25

00:01:06.350  -->  00:01:09.139
this set for ID. We could create it for name

26

00:01:09.139  -->  00:01:12.020
just like we did with the previous set

27

00:01:12.020  -->  00:01:15.289
but ID's a bit safer because it is

28

00:01:15.289  -->  00:01:17.780
definitely a unique field. So right-click

29

00:01:17.780  -->  00:01:23.569
ID and select create, select set, now here

30

00:01:23.569  -->  00:01:25.789
what we're doing is we're selecting the

31

00:01:25.789  -->  00:01:27.920
dimension we're creating this set for.

32

00:01:27.920  -->  00:01:31.850
The condition of this categories of this

33

00:01:31.850  -->  00:01:33.679
dimension being in and out of the set

34

00:01:33.679  -->  00:01:35.060
can be different and that's what we're

35

00:01:35.060  -->  00:01:36.529
going to specify now. They can actually

36

00:01:36.529  -->  00:01:38.899
involve measures that's exactly what

37

00:01:38.899  -->  00:01:40.490
we'll need. So let's give this second

38

00:01:40.490  -->  00:01:41.719
name, we'll call it

39

00:01:41.719  -->  00:01:52.150
top 10 startups by growth dynamic set

40

00:01:52.150  -->  00:01:54.490
and here you can do first thing you can

41

00:01:54.490  -->  00:01:56.830
do right away you can maybe select the

42

00:01:56.830  -->  00:01:59.080
ones that you want in this set so that

43

00:01:59.080  -->  00:02:00.610
would be similar to what we did before

44

00:02:00.610  -->  00:02:03.670
but the only difference is that we could

45

00:02:03.670  -->  00:02:05.710
think we can then later adjust very

46

00:02:05.710  -->  00:02:07.840
easily which startups would go in, which

47

00:02:07.840  -->  00:02:09.820
startups don't go in, but we won't be

48

00:02:09.820  -->  00:02:12.040
doing that. Here in the general tab, we'll

49

00:02:12.040  -->  00:02:14.260
select use all and that we'll make sure

50

00:02:14.260  -->  00:02:16.150
that everything we have in our data

51

00:02:16.150  -->  00:02:18.220
all the categories are participating in

52

00:02:18.220  -->  00:02:20.380
the creation of the set. If you leave it

53

00:02:20.380  -->  00:02:23.110
on this and then you for some reason you

54

00:02:23.110  -->  00:02:26.140
get a few more categories so if you even

55

00:02:26.140  -->  00:02:27.760
select all here but then you get a few

56

00:02:27.760  -->  00:02:30.130
more categories they won't fall into

57

00:02:30.130  -->  00:02:32.260
your into the creation of your set and

58

00:02:32.260  -->  00:02:34.270
that might cause a problem. So the best

59

00:02:34.270  -->  00:02:36.190
thing we can do here is click use all.

60

00:02:36.190  -->  00:02:39.700
Now we can specify the condition that

61

00:02:39.700  -->  00:02:44.050
tells us whether or not and a company

62

00:02:44.050  -->  00:02:45.940
falls into this set. We could specify

63

00:02:45.940  -->  00:02:48.370
condition here but for the first set

64

00:02:48.370  -->  00:02:50.410
that we'll create, we'll use this top tab

65

00:02:50.410  -->  00:02:53.920
over here which is a very convenient. So

66

00:02:53.920  -->  00:02:59.260
here you can select by field top 10 and

67

00:02:59.260  -->  00:03:01.540
select the 2015 growth percentage.

68

00:03:01.540  -->  00:03:03.610
Aggregation once again doesn't matter,

69

00:03:03.610  -->  00:03:07.480
and click OK and right away that has

70

00:03:07.480  -->  00:03:10.690
created a new set for us. There it is top 10

71

00:03:10.690  -->  00:03:14.200
startups by growth dynamic set. Now let's

72

00:03:14.200  -->  00:03:16.720
go and see how we can use this new set.

73

00:03:16.720  -->  00:03:18.640
Let's go back to a tree map and let's

74

00:03:18.640  -->  00:03:21.880
take out our old set and put in our new

75

00:03:21.880  -->  00:03:24.250
set. As you can see, the result is exactly

76

00:03:24.250  -->  00:03:26.590
the same but we have a major advantage

77

00:03:26.590  -->  00:03:29.620
now. Now we can control our visual by

78

00:03:29.620  -->  00:03:31.300
controlling the set. If you right-click

79

00:03:31.300  -->  00:03:34.030
on the set and click edit set and then

80

00:03:34.030  -->  00:03:36.670
go to top instead of 10 we can simply

81

00:03:36.670  -->  00:03:39.850
specify five and the visual adjust can

82

00:03:39.850  -->  00:03:42.070
specify three and the visual will adjust

83

00:03:42.070  -->  00:03:45.100
again and so now we might want to change

84

00:03:45.100  -->  00:03:46.989
the name of the set from top 10 to just

85

00:03:46.989  -->  00:03:49.510
top startups because we can very

86

00:03:49.510  -->  00:03:52.269
conveniently change the number of

87

00:03:52.269  -->  00:03:54.489
startups and top startups by growth that

88

00:03:54.489  -->  00:03:57.130
we're looking at. So let's click OK and

89

00:03:57.130  -->  00:03:59.110
that was the first example of how to

90

00:03:59.110  -->  00:04:01.810
create a dynamic set using the top tab

91

00:04:01.810  -->  00:04:03.459
now let's go ahead and create another

92

00:04:03.459  -->  00:04:05.560
one using the other tabs

93

00:04:05.560  -->  00:04:08.530
calculation. I'm going to create a new sheet and

94

00:04:08.530  -->  00:04:11.980
I will call it scatterplot and here as you

95

00:04:11.980  -->  00:04:14.050
recall the venture capital fund wants to

96

00:04:14.050  -->  00:04:16.600
look at two characteristics of the

97

00:04:16.600  -->  00:04:18.790
startups that it's considering for

98

00:04:18.790  -->  00:04:20.530
investment. It wants to look at revenue

99

00:04:20.530  -->  00:04:23.560
and expenses and that's on top of the

100

00:04:23.560  -->  00:04:25.000
growth that we've already started

101

00:04:25.000  -->  00:04:27.190
looking at. So let's go ahead and drag

102

00:04:27.190  -->  00:04:29.800
revenue and expenses into our chart. We'll

103

00:04:29.800  -->  00:04:31.990
put revenue on the horizontal axis and

104

00:04:31.990  -->  00:04:35.830
expenses on the vertical axis and now we

105

00:04:35.830  -->  00:04:37.660
don't want aggregation we want just the

106

00:04:37.660  -->  00:04:39.250
scatterplot, so to do that we're going to

107

00:04:39.250  -->  00:04:41.350
go to analysis and we'll uncheck

108

00:04:41.350  -->  00:04:44.500
aggregate measures and there we go so

109

00:04:44.500  -->  00:04:48.880
that is our scatterplot. For now let's

110

00:04:48.880  -->  00:04:50.919
focus on revenue, as you can see revenue

111

00:04:50.919  -->  00:04:52.300
varies from just over million

112

00:04:52.300  -->  00:04:57.070
to just over 16 million for the year.

113

00:04:57.070  -->  00:04:59.710
Let's say the venture capital fund has a

114

00:04:59.710  -->  00:05:02.260
cut off and they only want to look at

115

00:05:02.260  -->  00:05:07.150
other companies that have revenue or

116

00:05:07.150  -->  00:05:09.640
about 9 million let's say they want to

117

00:05:09.640  -->  00:05:11.620
look at companies with that had revenue

118

00:05:11.620  -->  00:05:13.780
over 9 million so the companies on the right over

119

00:05:13.780  -->  00:05:14.530
here.

120

00:05:14.530  -->  00:05:18.700
How can we create a visualization that

121

00:05:18.700  -->  00:05:21.220
represents that? well right away we just

122

00:05:21.220  -->  00:05:23.050
want to create a set so once again we

123

00:05:23.050  -->  00:05:24.970
want to create a set for ID so that's

124

00:05:24.970  -->  00:05:26.410
the dimension that will be creating a

125

00:05:26.410  -->  00:05:28.990
set for because it's at the level of the

126

00:05:28.990  -->  00:05:33.430
company. We want to create set we want to

127

00:05:33.430  -->  00:05:36.070
use all once again and then want to add

128

00:05:36.070  -->  00:05:38.650
a condition so this time we don't we

129

00:05:38.650  -->  00:05:42.340
can't say the top number of companies

130

00:05:42.340  -->  00:05:44.229
because we don't know how many will fall

131

00:05:44.229  -->  00:05:46.630
into that we actually have a curve point which

132

00:05:46.630  -->  00:05:49.539
is nine million. So let's say condition

133

00:05:49.539  -->  00:05:56.680
where by field 2015 revenue some doesn't

134

00:05:56.680  -->  00:05:58.240
matter which aggregation we use once

135

00:05:58.240  -->  00:05:59.979
again because we're at the most granular

136

00:05:59.979  -->  00:06:03.070
level is greater than and then just here

137

00:06:03.070  -->  00:06:06.910
will type in our 9 million and will

138

00:06:06.910  -->  00:06:09.820
click ok. So we've created our set. We

139

00:06:09.820  -->  00:06:12.370
didn't get a name so let's quickly give

140

00:06:12.370  -->  00:06:15.400
it a name so this is going to be high

141

00:06:15.400  -->  00:06:18.030
revenue.

142

00:06:18.030  -->  00:06:22.080
Click apply and there's our set. So now

143

00:06:22.080  -->  00:06:24.780
we can drag it onto color and right away

144

00:06:24.780  -->  00:06:27.810
we can see the companies that have high

145

00:06:27.810  -->  00:06:29.550
revenue. So let's make this look a bit

146

00:06:29.550  -->  00:06:33.660
better instead of shapes we're going to

147

00:06:33.660  -->  00:06:37.110
use circles and maybe give this to these

148

00:06:37.110  -->  00:06:39.210
circles a bit of some some transparency

149

00:06:39.210  -->  00:06:42.930
and maybe increase the size a little bit.

150

00:06:42.930  -->  00:06:45.420
There we go so right away on the right

151

00:06:45.420  -->  00:06:47.460
here we see the companies that the

152

00:06:47.460  -->  00:06:50.130
venture capital fund might be interested

153

00:06:50.130  -->  00:06:51.990
in and if they want to change the

154

00:06:51.990  -->  00:06:54.240
condition we can very quickly do it we

155

00:06:54.240  -->  00:06:58.050
just right click and click edit set and

156

00:06:58.050  -->  00:07:00.270
here let's say they now want to consider

157

00:07:00.270  -->  00:07:02.820
only companies that had over 10 million

158

00:07:02.820  -->  00:07:04.110
dollars in revenue

159

00:07:04.110  -->  00:07:06.660
just click apply as you can see the set

160

00:07:06.660  -->  00:07:08.730
very quickly change. So that's how you

161

00:07:08.730  -->  00:07:10.680
create dynamic sets those are two ways

162

00:07:10.680  -->  00:07:13.770
we looked at using the top tab and using

163

00:07:13.770  -->  00:07:16.980
a calculation and in the next tutorial,

164

00:07:16.980  -->  00:07:20.370
we will learn how to combine sets. I look

165

00:07:20.370  -->  00:07:31.819
forward to see you next time.
