00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.769
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06.769  -->  00:00:06.779

3

00:00:06.779  -->  00:00:08.839
course in Tableau. Today we're starting the

4

00:00:08.839  -->  00:00:08.849

5

00:00:08.849  -->  00:00:11.839
section on animations. To get the data

6

00:00:11.839  -->  00:00:11.849

7

00:00:11.849  -->  00:00:12.259
set,

8

00:00:12.259  -->  00:00:12.269

9

00:00:12.269  -->  00:00:17.700
you need to go to superdatascience.com/tableau-advanced and if you

10

00:00:17.720  -->  00:00:17.730

11

00:00:17.730  -->  00:00:19.580
scroll down to the bottom here in

12

00:00:19.580  -->  00:00:19.590

13

00:00:19.590  -->  00:00:22.160
section 5 animations you will see quite

14

00:00:22.160  -->  00:00:22.170

15

00:00:22.170  -->  00:00:24.529
a few files so you got the challenge and

16

00:00:24.529  -->  00:00:24.539

17

00:00:24.539  -->  00:00:27.230
you've got four datasets which all have

18

00:00:27.230  -->  00:00:27.240

19

00:00:27.240  -->  00:00:30.620
been taken from the worldbank.org

20

00:00:30.620  -->  00:00:30.630

21

00:00:30.630  -->  00:00:31.640
website.

22

00:00:31.640  -->  00:00:31.650

23

00:00:31.650  -->  00:00:34.970
Alright now that we have the datasets,

24

00:00:34.970  -->  00:00:34.980

25

00:00:34.980  -->  00:00:37.970
let's open up the challenge and see what

26

00:00:37.970  -->  00:00:37.980

27

00:00:37.980  -->  00:00:40.310
it says here. You have been hired by the

28

00:00:40.310  -->  00:00:40.320

29

00:00:40.320  -->  00:00:42.799
World Bank as a Tableau developer, your

30

00:00:42.799  -->  00:00:42.809

31

00:00:42.809  -->  00:00:44.270
first assignment is to deliver an

32

00:00:44.270  -->  00:00:44.280

33

00:00:44.280  -->  00:00:46.040
animated dashboard showing how

34

00:00:46.040  -->  00:00:46.050

35

00:00:46.050  -->  00:00:47.750
population's of countries across the

36

00:00:47.750  -->  00:00:47.760

37

00:00:47.760  -->  00:00:50.180
world have been in developing over the

38

00:00:50.180  -->  00:00:50.190

39

00:00:50.190  -->  00:00:52.369
past 50 years specifically the

40

00:00:52.369  -->  00:00:52.379

41

00:00:52.379  -->  00:00:53.900
stakeholders of this assignment are

42

00:00:53.900  -->  00:00:53.910

43

00:00:53.910  -->  00:00:55.729
interested to see overall trends

44

00:00:55.729  -->  00:00:55.739

45

00:00:55.739  -->  00:00:57.889
infertility life expectancy and

46

00:00:57.889  -->  00:00:57.899

47

00:00:57.899  -->  00:01:00.200
population in addition to overall trends

48

00:01:00.200  -->  00:01:00.210

49

00:01:00.210  -->  00:01:02.090
they would like to be able to drill into

50

00:01:02.090  -->  00:01:02.100

51

00:01:02.100  -->  00:01:04.009
individual countries.

52

00:01:04.009  -->  00:01:04.019

53

00:01:04.019  -->  00:01:06.200
Ok so that's a challenge and the

54

00:01:06.200  -->  00:01:06.210

55

00:01:06.210  -->  00:01:07.910
interesting bit is that this time is

56

00:01:07.910  -->  00:01:07.920

57

00:01:07.920  -->  00:01:10.640
going to be a bit different to what we

58

00:01:10.640  -->  00:01:10.650

59

00:01:10.650  -->  00:01:12.679
usually expect. I'm actually going to

60

00:01:12.679  -->  00:01:12.689

61

00:01:12.689  -->  00:01:16.039
show you the end result first and it

62

00:01:16.039  -->  00:01:16.049

63

00:01:16.049  -->  00:01:17.510
won't be the end result the one that

64

00:01:17.510  -->  00:01:17.520

65

00:01:17.520  -->  00:01:19.999
we'll create but it will be what we will

66

00:01:19.999  -->  00:01:20.009

67

00:01:20.009  -->  00:01:22.340
be replicating so let me bring up a

68

00:01:22.340  -->  00:01:22.350

69

00:01:22.350  -->  00:01:25.880
browser to explain what I mean. So here

70

00:01:25.880  -->  00:01:25.890

71

00:01:25.890  -->  00:01:27.530
I've got a TED talk by the way if you

72

00:01:27.530  -->  00:01:27.540

73

00:01:27.540  -->  00:01:29.060
haven't been to this website ted.com,

74

00:01:29.060  -->  00:01:29.070

75

00:01:29.070  -->  00:01:31.700
definitely check it out. It's got amazing

76

00:01:31.700  -->  00:01:31.710

77

00:01:31.710  -->  00:01:34.340
very inspiring talks on all different

78

00:01:34.340  -->  00:01:34.350

79

00:01:34.350  -->  00:01:38.060
subjects and science, on literature, on

80

00:01:38.060  -->  00:01:38.070

81

00:01:38.070  -->  00:01:40.310
psychology, on everything and just very

82

00:01:40.310  -->  00:01:40.320

83

00:01:40.320  -->  00:01:42.950
short talks that people share great

84

00:01:42.950  -->  00:01:42.960

85

00:01:42.960  -->  00:01:45.289
information and here we've got Hans

86

00:01:45.289  -->  00:01:45.299

87

00:01:45.299  -->  00:01:49.010
Rosling. In 2006, he shared the best

88

00:01:49.010  -->  00:01:49.020

89

00:01:49.020  -->  00:01:51.590
stats you've ever seen so he had some

90

00:01:51.590  -->  00:01:51.600

91

00:01:51.600  -->  00:01:53.480
very interesting visualizations of

92

00:01:53.480  -->  00:01:53.490

93

00:01:53.490  -->  00:01:56.970
different demographic and

94

00:01:56.970  -->  00:01:56.980

95

00:01:56.980  -->  00:02:00.060
different types of data sets and they

96

00:02:00.060  -->  00:02:00.070

97

00:02:00.070  -->  00:02:03.120
were very very forward-thinking for that

98

00:02:03.120  -->  00:02:03.130

99

00:02:03.130  -->  00:02:04.980
time and I'm just going to show you a

100

00:02:04.980  -->  00:02:04.990

101

00:02:04.990  -->  00:02:06.810
bit of his presentation so just going to

102

00:02:06.810  -->  00:02:06.820

103

00:02:06.820  -->  00:02:08.880
click play now and will be about two

104

00:02:08.880  -->  00:02:08.890

105

00:02:08.890  -->  00:02:10.440
minutes long and you will see the

106

00:02:10.440  -->  00:02:10.450

107

00:02:10.450  -->  00:02:12.960
dashboard that we will be recreating so

108

00:02:12.960  -->  00:02:12.970

109

00:02:12.970  -->  00:02:14.670
that you know what will be aspiring

110

00:02:14.670  -->  00:02:14.680

111

00:02:14.680  -->  00:02:17.880
towards. So here we go, because my

112

00:02:17.880  -->  00:02:17.890

113

00:02:17.890  -->  00:02:20.550
students what they said when they looked

114

00:02:20.550  -->  00:02:20.560

115

00:02:20.560  -->  00:02:22.530
upon the world and I asked them what do

116

00:02:22.530  -->  00:02:22.540

117

00:02:22.540  -->  00:02:24.390
you really think about the world and

118

00:02:24.390  -->  00:02:24.400

119

00:02:24.400  -->  00:02:26.520
while I first discovered that the

120

00:02:26.520  -->  00:02:26.530

121

00:02:26.530  -->  00:02:29.850
textbook was tenting mainly and and they

122

00:02:29.850  -->  00:02:29.860

123

00:02:29.860  -->  00:02:32.250
said the world is still we and them and

124

00:02:32.250  -->  00:02:32.260

125

00:02:32.260  -->  00:02:34.830
we is Western world and them is third

126

00:02:34.830  -->  00:02:34.840

127

00:02:34.840  -->  00:02:37.410
world and what do you mean with Western

128

00:02:37.410  -->  00:02:37.420

129

00:02:37.420  -->  00:02:39.480
world I said. Well that's long life in

130

00:02:39.480  -->  00:02:39.490

131

00:02:39.490  -->  00:02:41.700
small family, and third world is short

132

00:02:41.700  -->  00:02:41.710

133

00:02:41.710  -->  00:02:44.790
life in large family so this is what I

134

00:02:44.790  -->  00:02:44.800

135

00:02:44.800  -->  00:02:47.280
could display here I put fertility rate

136

00:02:47.280  -->  00:02:47.290

137

00:02:47.290  -->  00:02:50.700
here, number of children per woman 1,2,3,4

138

00:02:50.700  -->  00:02:50.710

139

00:02:50.710  -->  00:02:52.950
up to about eight children per woman. We

140

00:02:52.950  -->  00:02:52.960

141

00:02:52.960  -->  00:02:55.050
have very good data since 1962, 1960

142

00:02:55.050  -->  00:02:55.060

143

00:02:55.060  -->  00:02:57.600
about on the size of

144

00:02:57.600  -->  00:02:57.610

145

00:02:57.610  -->  00:02:59.520
families in all country. The error margin

146

00:02:59.520  -->  00:02:59.530

147

00:02:59.530  -->  00:03:01.770
is narrow. Here I put life expectancy at

148

00:03:01.770  -->  00:03:01.780

149

00:03:01.780  -->  00:03:04.440
birth from 30 years in some countries up

150

00:03:04.440  -->  00:03:04.450

151

00:03:04.450  -->  00:03:07.680
to about 70 years and 1962 that was

152

00:03:07.680  -->  00:03:07.690

153

00:03:07.690  -->  00:03:09.330
really a group of countries here that

154

00:03:09.330  -->  00:03:09.340

155

00:03:09.340  -->  00:03:11.460
was industrialized countries and they

156

00:03:11.460  -->  00:03:11.470

157

00:03:11.470  -->  00:03:14.490
had small families and long lives and

158

00:03:14.490  -->  00:03:14.500

159

00:03:14.500  -->  00:03:16.110
these were the developing countries they

160

00:03:16.110  -->  00:03:16.120

161

00:03:16.120  -->  00:03:18.000
had large families and they had

162

00:03:18.000  -->  00:03:18.010

163

00:03:18.010  -->  00:03:20.070
relatively short lives. Now what has

164

00:03:20.070  -->  00:03:20.080

165

00:03:20.080  -->  00:03:22.470
happened in 1962, we want to see the

166

00:03:22.470  -->  00:03:22.480

167

00:03:22.480  -->  00:03:24.840
change of the students right? It's still

168

00:03:24.840  -->  00:03:24.850

169

00:03:24.850  -->  00:03:26.790
two types of countries or have these

170

00:03:26.790  -->  00:03:26.800

171

00:03:26.800  -->  00:03:28.350
developing countries got smaller

172

00:03:28.350  -->  00:03:28.360

173

00:03:28.360  -->  00:03:30.300
families and they live here or have they

174

00:03:30.300  -->  00:03:30.310

175

00:03:30.310  -->  00:03:32.370
got longer lives and live up there.

176

00:03:32.370  -->  00:03:32.380

177

00:03:32.380  -->  00:03:34.050
Let's see we stop the world and this is

178

00:03:34.050  -->  00:03:34.060

179

00:03:34.060  -->  00:03:35.940
all you and statistic that has been

180

00:03:35.940  -->  00:03:35.950

181

00:03:35.950  -->  00:03:37.320
available. Here we go

182

00:03:37.320  -->  00:03:37.330

183

00:03:37.330  -->  00:03:38.790
can you see there, it shine out there

184

00:03:38.790  -->  00:03:38.800

185

00:03:38.800  -->  00:03:40.290
moving games better health care

186

00:03:40.290  -->  00:03:40.300

187

00:03:40.300  -->  00:03:42.270
improving their or the green Latin

188

00:03:42.270  -->  00:03:42.280

189

00:03:42.280  -->  00:03:43.800
American countries they are moving

190

00:03:43.800  -->  00:03:43.810

191

00:03:43.810  -->  00:03:45.750
towards smaller families. Your yellow

192

00:03:45.750  -->  00:03:45.760

193

00:03:45.760  -->  00:03:47.550
ones here are the Arabic countries and

194

00:03:47.550  -->  00:03:47.560

195

00:03:47.560  -->  00:03:49.620
they get larger families but they no

196

00:03:49.620  -->  00:03:49.630

197

00:03:49.630  -->  00:03:51.479
longer life but not larger families. The

198

00:03:51.479  -->  00:03:51.489

199

00:03:51.489  -->  00:03:53.040
Africans are the green down here but

200

00:03:53.040  -->  00:03:53.050

201

00:03:53.050  -->  00:03:54.660
still remain here. This is India,

202

00:03:54.660  -->  00:03:54.670

203

00:03:54.670  -->  00:03:56.850
Indonesia is moving on pretty fast and

204

00:03:56.850  -->  00:03:56.860

205

00:03:56.860  -->  00:03:58.860
in the eighties here you have Bangladesh,

206

00:03:58.860  -->  00:03:58.870

207

00:03:58.870  -->  00:04:01.140
still among the African comfort there. But

208

00:04:01.140  -->  00:04:01.150

209

00:04:01.150  -->  00:04:02.729
now Bangladesh, it's a miracle that

210

00:04:02.729  -->  00:04:02.739

211

00:04:02.739  -->  00:04:05.130
happens in the eighties. The Oman start to

212

00:04:05.130  -->  00:04:05.140

213

00:04:05.140  -->  00:04:07.110
promote family planning and they move up

214

00:04:07.110  -->  00:04:07.120

215

00:04:07.120  -->  00:04:07.690
into that

216

00:04:07.690  -->  00:04:07.700

217

00:04:07.700  -->  00:04:10.000
corner and in nineties, we have the

218

00:04:10.000  -->  00:04:10.010

219

00:04:10.010  -->  00:04:12.640
terrible HIV epidemic that takes down

220

00:04:12.640  -->  00:04:12.650

221

00:04:12.650  -->  00:04:14.740
the life expectancy of the African

222

00:04:14.740  -->  00:04:14.750

223

00:04:14.750  -->  00:04:16.900
countries and all the rest of the world

224

00:04:16.900  -->  00:04:16.910

225

00:04:16.910  -->  00:04:19.300
moves up into the corner where we have

226

00:04:19.300  -->  00:04:19.310

227

00:04:19.310  -->  00:04:21.699
long lives and small family and we have

228

00:04:21.699  -->  00:04:21.709

229

00:04:21.709  -->  00:04:35.380
a completely new world.

230

00:04:35.380  -->  00:04:35.390

231

00:04:35.390  -->  00:04:37.840
Let me make a comparison directly

232

00:04:37.840  -->  00:04:37.850

233

00:04:37.850  -->  00:04:40.270
between, so there we go,

234

00:04:40.270  -->  00:04:40.280

235

00:04:40.280  -->  00:04:42.520
how was that pretty inspiring wasn't it?

236

00:04:42.520  -->  00:04:42.530

237

00:04:42.530  -->  00:04:44.800
In fact one of the students of the basic

238

00:04:44.800  -->  00:04:44.810

239

00:04:44.810  -->  00:04:46.900
Tableau course actually suggested this

240

00:04:46.900  -->  00:04:46.910

241

00:04:46.910  -->  00:04:49.600
video so thanks a lot for that and in

242

00:04:49.600  -->  00:04:49.610

243

00:04:49.610  -->  00:04:51.220
our section here we're going to be

244

00:04:51.220  -->  00:04:51.230

245

00:04:51.230  -->  00:04:53.350
recreating that visual and more we're

246

00:04:53.350  -->  00:04:53.360

247

00:04:53.360  -->  00:04:55.030
actually going to update because this

248

00:04:55.030  -->  00:04:55.040

249

00:04:55.040  -->  00:04:58.210
visualization was created some 2006 and

250

00:04:58.210  -->  00:04:58.220

251

00:04:58.220  -->  00:05:00.850
it's 2015 now. So we have quite a bit

252

00:05:00.850  -->  00:05:00.860

253

00:05:00.860  -->  00:05:03.700
more years of data which we will add

254

00:05:03.700  -->  00:05:03.710

255

00:05:03.710  -->  00:05:05.890
into that. So there we go, that's what we

256

00:05:05.890  -->  00:05:05.900

257

00:05:05.900  -->  00:05:09.010
will be creating and we will start right

258

00:05:09.010  -->  00:05:09.020

259

00:05:09.020  -->  00:05:11.890
in the next tutorial of this section. I look

260

00:05:11.890  -->  00:05:11.900

261

00:05:11.900  -->  00:05:13.000
forward to seeing you next time and

262

00:05:13.000  -->  00:05:13.010

263

00:05:13.010  -->  00:05:19.570
until then, happy analyzing.
