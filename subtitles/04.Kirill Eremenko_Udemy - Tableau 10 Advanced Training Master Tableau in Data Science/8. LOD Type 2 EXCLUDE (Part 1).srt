00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,829
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06,829  -->  00:00:06,839

3

00:00:06,839  -->  00:00:08,509
course in Tableau. In today's tutorial

4

00:00:08,509  -->  00:00:08,519

5

00:00:08,519  -->  00:00:11,360
we're going to talk about the LOD or

6

00:00:11,360  -->  00:00:11,370

7

00:00:11,370  -->  00:00:14,720
level of detail calculation which is

8

00:00:14,720  -->  00:00:14,730

9

00:00:14,730  -->  00:00:17,779
type 2 exclude. So let's dive straight

10

00:00:17,779  -->  00:00:17,789

11

00:00:17,789  -->  00:00:20,210
into it. We're going to take our map,

12

00:00:20,210  -->  00:00:20,220

13

00:00:20,220  -->  00:00:23,450
I'm going to duplicate our map and here

14

00:00:23,450  -->  00:00:23,460

15

00:00:23,460  -->  00:00:28,250
we're going to say LOD exclude and

16

00:00:28,250  -->  00:00:28,260

17

00:00:28,260  -->  00:00:30,980
here we'll just say part 1 and I'll

18

00:00:30,980  -->  00:00:30,990

19

00:00:30,990  -->  00:00:34,850
explain why its part 1 in a second and

20

00:00:34,850  -->  00:00:34,860

21

00:00:34,860  -->  00:00:37,010
well there will be two parts. So we'll

22

00:00:37,010  -->  00:00:37,020

23

00:00:37,020  -->  00:00:40,069
actually see see it as we create it. Alright

24

00:00:40,069  -->  00:00:40,079

25

00:00:40,079  -->  00:00:41,630
so what we're going to do well we're

26

00:00:41,630  -->  00:00:41,640

27

00:00:41,640  -->  00:00:44,840
going to go to a higher level of

28

00:00:44,840  -->  00:00:44,850

29

00:00:44,850  -->  00:00:47,000
granularity. We're going to go to the

30

00:00:47,000  -->  00:00:47,010

31

00:00:47,010  -->  00:00:50,479
level of granularity of one individual

32

00:00:50,479  -->  00:00:50,489

33

00:00:50,489  -->  00:00:52,850
City and right away here we're going to

34

00:00:52,850  -->  00:00:52,860

35

00:00:52,860  -->  00:00:55,459
we're just going to keep profit as the

36

00:00:55,459  -->  00:00:55,469

37

00:00:55,469  -->  00:00:58,549
so we keep sum of profit as color and

38

00:00:58,549  -->  00:00:58,559

39

00:00:58,559  -->  00:00:59,689
here we're going to just quickly adjust

40

00:00:59,689  -->  00:00:59,699

41

00:00:59,699  -->  00:01:01,549
color going to set the transparency to

42

00:01:01,549  -->  00:01:01,559

43

00:01:01,559  -->  00:01:04,039
80% and so that we can see points that fall

44

00:01:04,039  -->  00:01:04,049

45

00:01:04,049  -->  00:01:07,760
behind each other and we'll also add a

46

00:01:07,760  -->  00:01:07,770

47

00:01:07,770  -->  00:01:12,200
border so that we can actually see our

48

00:01:12,200  -->  00:01:12,210

49

00:01:12,210  -->  00:01:13,490
points better.

50

00:01:13,490  -->  00:01:13,500

51

00:01:13,500  -->  00:01:15,590
Alright so what do we want to do? Well

52

00:01:15,590  -->  00:01:15,600

53

00:01:15,600  -->  00:01:19,370
what we want to do is we want to look at

54

00:01:19,370  -->  00:01:19,380

55

00:01:19,380  -->  00:01:22,039
the profit. So let's say we want to work

56

00:01:22,039  -->  00:01:22,049

57

00:01:22,049  -->  00:01:25,370
at the level of detail or level of

58

00:01:25,370  -->  00:01:25,380

59

00:01:25,380  -->  00:01:27,200
granularity or level of aggregation.

60

00:01:27,200  -->  00:01:27,210

61

00:01:27,210  -->  00:01:30,950
So our visualization should stay at this

62

00:01:30,950  -->  00:01:30,960

63

00:01:30,960  -->  00:01:33,560
level at the level of City but what we

64

00:01:33,560  -->  00:01:33,570

65

00:01:33,570  -->  00:01:36,200
want to do is we want to in a formula go

66

00:01:36,200  -->  00:01:36,210

67

00:01:36,210  -->  00:01:40,310
back to this level of State and from

68

00:01:40,310  -->  00:01:40,320

69

00:01:40,320  -->  00:01:42,920
here we want to extract these values so

70

00:01:42,920  -->  00:01:42,930

71

00:01:42,930  -->  00:01:45,710
we want to, let me just cancel that we want

72

00:01:45,710  -->  00:01:45,720

73

00:01:45,720  -->  00:01:52,190
to extract the sum of all of the sales

74

00:01:52,190  -->  00:01:52,200

75

00:01:52,200  -->  00:01:54,469
of all the profit for each individual

76

00:01:54,469  -->  00:01:54,479

77

00:01:54,479  -->  00:01:57,560
State. So we want to take the sum of

78

00:01:57,560  -->  00:01:57,570

79

00:01:57,570  -->  00:01:59,870
for this state, the sum of profit

80

00:01:59,870  -->  00:01:59,880

81

00:01:59,880  -->  00:02:01,700
for this state, for this state and we

82

00:02:01,700  -->  00:02:01,710

83

00:02:01,710  -->  00:02:04,490
will need that number back brought back

84

00:02:04,490  -->  00:02:04,500

85

00:02:04,500  -->  00:02:07,789
to our level of granularity

86

00:02:07,789  -->  00:02:07,799

87

00:02:07,799  -->  00:02:11,150
for City. Why we need that number we'll

88

00:02:11,150  -->  00:02:11,160

89

00:02:11,160  -->  00:02:12,840
find out in a bit but

90

00:02:12,840  -->  00:02:12,850

91

00:02:12,850  -->  00:02:15,000
now we know that that is our task. We

92

00:02:15,000  -->  00:02:15,010

93

00:02:15,010  -->  00:02:17,820
want to get to that number so even

94

00:02:17,820  -->  00:02:17,830

95

00:02:17,830  -->  00:02:18,840
though we're at the level of granularity

96

00:02:18,840  -->  00:02:18,850

97

00:02:18,850  -->  00:02:22,530
of City. How do we find out the profit

98

00:02:22,530  -->  00:02:22,540

99

00:02:22,540  -->  00:02:25,410
for the actual State? So let's say this

100

00:02:25,410  -->  00:02:25,420

101

00:02:25,420  -->  00:02:26,790
let's have a look here for North Dakota, a

102

00:02:26,790  -->  00:02:26,800

103

00:02:26,800  -->  00:02:29,280
total profit so sum of profit across

104

00:02:29,280  -->  00:02:29,290

105

00:02:29,290  -->  00:02:33,150
all items, in all orders, in all cities,

106

00:02:33,150  -->  00:02:33,160

107

00:02:33,160  -->  00:02:37,350
across all of the years is 7,002 dollars.

108

00:02:37,350  -->  00:02:37,360

109

00:02:37,360  -->  00:02:39,480
So how do we get that value seven

110

00:02:39,480  -->  00:02:39,490

111

00:02:39,490  -->  00:02:41,550
thousand and two dollars to this level

112

00:02:41,550  -->  00:02:41,560

113

00:02:41,560  -->  00:02:43,380
of granularity? How would we bring it

114

00:02:43,380  -->  00:02:43,390

115

00:02:43,390  -->  00:02:47,100
back? So that we can work with it at this

116

00:02:47,100  -->  00:02:47,110

117

00:02:47,110  -->  00:02:49,290
level of granularity. How do we display it

118

00:02:49,290  -->  00:02:49,300

119

00:02:49,300  -->  00:02:50,040
here?

120

00:02:50,040  -->  00:02:50,050

121

00:02:50,050  -->  00:02:51,630
Well that's what we're going to do and

122

00:02:51,630  -->  00:02:51,640

123

00:02:51,640  -->  00:02:54,570
for that we're going to need the exclude

124

00:02:54,570  -->  00:02:54,580

125

00:02:54,580  -->  00:02:58,590
level of detail calculation. So let's

126

00:02:58,590  -->  00:02:58,600

127

00:02:58,600  -->  00:03:01,500
quickly again create two

128

00:03:01,500  -->  00:03:01,510

129

00:03:01,510  -->  00:03:04,020
visualization side-by-side, so here we've

130

00:03:04,020  -->  00:03:04,030

131

00:03:04,030  -->  00:03:07,140
got just the normal profit right so this

132

00:03:07,140  -->  00:03:07,150

133

00:03:07,150  -->  00:03:08,370
one we're not going to change this is

134

00:03:08,370  -->  00:03:08,380

135

00:03:08,380  -->  00:03:10,170
going to be the visualization without

136

00:03:10,170  -->  00:03:10,180

137

00:03:10,180  -->  00:03:12,390
the level of detail calculation and here

138

00:03:12,390  -->  00:03:12,400

139

00:03:12,400  -->  00:03:14,820
we've got just the normal profit and

140

00:03:14,820  -->  00:03:14,830

141

00:03:14,830  -->  00:03:15,930
again it's not what we're looking for

142

00:03:15,930  -->  00:03:15,940

143

00:03:15,940  -->  00:03:17,880
this is just a profit for every single

144

00:03:17,880  -->  00:03:17,890

145

00:03:17,890  -->  00:03:19,800
City and this time it's very evident

146

00:03:19,800  -->  00:03:19,810

147

00:03:19,810  -->  00:03:21,690
that this is not what we're looking for

148

00:03:21,690  -->  00:03:21,700

149

00:03:21,700  -->  00:03:24,660
because in every State we want this

150

00:03:24,660  -->  00:03:24,670

151

00:03:24,670  -->  00:03:27,270
value to be the same across all the

152

00:03:27,270  -->  00:03:27,280

153

00:03:27,280  -->  00:03:29,850
Cities alright, so in North Dakota we

154

00:03:29,850  -->  00:03:29,860

155

00:03:29,860  -->  00:03:32,130
want 7,000 what was it

156

00:03:32,130  -->  00:03:32,140

157

00:03:32,140  -->  00:03:34,920
let's go back to this one here we want

158

00:03:34,920  -->  00:03:34,930

159

00:03:34,930  -->  00:03:38,370
7,002 dollars for this City, 7,002 dollars

160

00:03:38,370  -->  00:03:38,380

161

00:03:38,380  -->  00:03:40,440
for this City and 7,002 dollars for the

162

00:03:40,440  -->  00:03:40,450

163

00:03:40,450  -->  00:03:41,880
City. So each City should have the same

164

00:03:41,880  -->  00:03:41,890

165

00:03:41,890  -->  00:03:43,620
value as we can see that's not the case

166

00:03:43,620  -->  00:03:43,630

167

00:03:43,630  -->  00:03:45,930
so this is not the correct calculation.

168

00:03:45,930  -->  00:03:45,940

169

00:03:45,940  -->  00:03:49,260
So how do we do that? Well let's start

170

00:03:49,260  -->  00:03:49,270

171

00:03:49,270  -->  00:03:51,300
creating a level of detail calculation

172

00:03:51,300  -->  00:03:51,310

173

00:03:51,310  -->  00:03:53,670
we're going to create click here click

174

00:03:53,670  -->  00:03:53,680

175

00:03:53,680  -->  00:03:56,010
create calculated field, again we can

176

00:03:56,010  -->  00:03:56,020

177

00:03:56,020  -->  00:03:58,320
called LOD normally would call it

178

00:03:58,320  -->  00:03:58,330

179

00:03:58,330  -->  00:04:01,710
something like LOD state profit. In our

180

00:04:01,710  -->  00:04:01,720

181

00:04:01,720  -->  00:04:03,930
case I'm going to say be more explicit,

182

00:04:03,930  -->  00:04:03,940

183

00:04:03,940  -->  00:04:08,070
I'm going to say exclude, so this is the type of LOD what

184

00:04:08,070  -->  00:04:08,080

185

00:04:08,080  -->  00:04:09,990
we're using exclude and then state

186

00:04:09,990  -->  00:04:10,000

187

00:04:10,000  -->  00:04:13,080
profit is what we're after the final

188

00:04:13,080  -->  00:04:13,090

189

00:04:13,090  -->  00:04:15,690
result. So here again we going to start with

190

00:04:15,690  -->  00:04:15,700

191

00:04:15,700  -->  00:04:18,660
cur.. curly braces and similar syntax

192

00:04:18,660  -->  00:04:18,670

193

00:04:18,670  -->  00:04:20,700
to include but in this case we're going

194

00:04:20,700  -->  00:04:20,710

195

00:04:20,710  -->  00:04:23,379
to use the exclude keyword.

196

00:04:23,379  -->  00:04:23,389

197

00:04:23,389  -->  00:04:25,209
What do you want to explain? This is the

198

00:04:25,209  -->  00:04:25,219

199

00:04:25,219  -->  00:04:27,610
this is the interesting part. So we get,

200

00:04:27,610  -->  00:04:27,620

201

00:04:27,620  -->  00:04:29,739
we know that we are at the level of

202

00:04:29,739  -->  00:04:29,749

203

00:04:29,749  -->  00:04:34,269
detail of a City right and the way to

204

00:04:34,269  -->  00:04:34,279

205

00:04:34,279  -->  00:04:36,820
think about it more generic let's, let's

206

00:04:36,820  -->  00:04:36,830

207

00:04:36,830  -->  00:04:39,249
go back to the basics. The way to think

208

00:04:39,249  -->  00:04:39,259

209

00:04:39,259  -->  00:04:41,559
about it is look at all of the

210

00:04:41,559  -->  00:04:41,569

211

00:04:41,569  -->  00:04:43,659
dimensions, dimensions are these ones, the

212

00:04:43,659  -->  00:04:43,669

213

00:04:43,669  -->  00:04:45,730
blue ones look at all of the dimensions

214

00:04:45,730  -->  00:04:45,740

215

00:04:45,740  -->  00:04:47,980
that you have on your visualization. So

216

00:04:47,980  -->  00:04:47,990

217

00:04:47,990  -->  00:04:50,050
for this visualization and that's it's

218

00:04:50,050  -->  00:04:50,060

219

00:04:50,060  -->  00:04:51,999
not consider that I just opened this one

220

00:04:51,999  -->  00:04:52,009

221

00:04:52,009  -->  00:04:53,619
because we don't care about this other

222

00:04:53,619  -->  00:04:53,629

223

00:04:53,629  -->  00:04:54,700
visualization we don't care about

224

00:04:54,700  -->  00:04:54,710

225

00:04:54,710  -->  00:04:56,439
anything else we care about this

226

00:04:56,439  -->  00:04:56,449

227

00:04:56,449  -->  00:04:58,510
visualization look at everything all the

228

00:04:58,510  -->  00:04:58,520

229

00:04:58,520  -->  00:05:01,779
blue items how many dimensions you have,

230

00:05:01,779  -->  00:05:01,789

231

00:05:01,789  -->  00:05:04,059
country, state, city and don't treat them

232

00:05:04,059  -->  00:05:04,069

233

00:05:04,069  -->  00:05:06,309
as all together treat them as separate

234

00:05:06,309  -->  00:05:06,319

235

00:05:06,319  -->  00:05:08,559
right? They could have been a gender &amp;

236

00:05:08,559  -->  00:05:08,569

237

00:05:08,569  -->  00:05:13,629
region and category and ship mode. It

238

00:05:13,629  -->  00:05:13,639

239

00:05:13,639  -->  00:05:14,740
could be you could have lots of

240

00:05:14,740  -->  00:05:14,750

241

00:05:14,750  -->  00:05:18,100
different dimensions. So I'm going back

242

00:05:18,100  -->  00:05:18,110

243

00:05:18,110  -->  00:05:19,510
to the basics and trying to make this as

244

00:05:19,510  -->  00:05:19,520

245

00:05:19,520  -->  00:05:22,360
generic as possible so that you will see

246

00:05:22,360  -->  00:05:22,370

247

00:05:22,370  -->  00:05:23,980
that we don't have to work with

248

00:05:23,980  -->  00:05:23,990

249

00:05:23,990  -->  00:05:25,540
geographies. You can apply the same

250

00:05:25,540  -->  00:05:25,550

251

00:05:25,550  -->  00:05:29,110
principles with any type of dimensions.

252

00:05:29,110  -->  00:05:29,120

253

00:05:29,120  -->  00:05:30,670
So in this case, we have three dimensions

254

00:05:30,670  -->  00:05:30,680

255

00:05:30,680  -->  00:05:33,700
country, state and city that govern the

256

00:05:33,700  -->  00:05:33,710

257

00:05:33,710  -->  00:05:36,820
granularity of our visualization. That is

258

00:05:36,820  -->  00:05:36,830

259

00:05:36,830  -->  00:05:38,950
what's happening here. The green stuff,

260

00:05:38,950  -->  00:05:38,960

261

00:05:38,960  -->  00:05:41,230
don't mind the longitude latitude

262

00:05:41,230  -->  00:05:41,240

263

00:05:41,240  -->  00:05:43,149
there, they're a bit specific. The green

264

00:05:43,149  -->  00:05:43,159

265

00:05:43,159  -->  00:05:45,129
stuff here some profit that is measure

266

00:05:45,129  -->  00:05:45,139

267

00:05:45,139  -->  00:05:47,529
those measures they are the items that

268

00:05:47,529  -->  00:05:47,539

269

00:05:47,539  -->  00:05:50,200
get aggregated. So they don't so measures

270

00:05:50,200  -->  00:05:50,210

271

00:05:50,210  -->  00:05:53,260
don't impact your granularity and

272

00:05:53,260  -->  00:05:53,270

273

00:05:53,270  -->  00:05:57,579
aggregation level they just they are the

274

00:05:57,579  -->  00:05:57,589

275

00:05:57,589  -->  00:06:00,579
numbers that get aggregated. What impacts

276

00:06:00,579  -->  00:06:00,589

277

00:06:00,589  -->  00:06:02,499
your aggregation and granularity level

278

00:06:02,499  -->  00:06:02,509

279

00:06:02,509  -->  00:06:05,469
is your or are your dimensions so in this

280

00:06:05,469  -->  00:06:05,479

281

00:06:05,479  -->  00:06:06,670
case we've got three of them country,

282

00:06:06,670  -->  00:06:06,680

283

00:06:06,680  -->  00:06:08,920
state and city.  What we want to do is we

284

00:06:08,920  -->  00:06:08,930

285

00:06:08,930  -->  00:06:11,649
want to basically go back take this

286

00:06:11,649  -->  00:06:11,659

287

00:06:11,659  -->  00:06:14,740
visualization and remove city, go to this

288

00:06:14,740  -->  00:06:14,750

289

00:06:14,750  -->  00:06:17,200
visualization, grab this number,

290

00:06:17,200  -->  00:06:17,210

291

00:06:17,210  -->  00:06:19,389
grab the sum of profit and then go back

292

00:06:19,389  -->  00:06:19,399

293

00:06:19,399  -->  00:06:21,909
and bring it back to this visualization.

294

00:06:21,909  -->  00:06:21,919

295

00:06:21,919  -->  00:06:23,409
That's what we're going to do. So

296

00:06:23,409  -->  00:06:23,419

297

00:06:23,419  -->  00:06:25,480
basically what we want to do is we want

298

00:06:25,480  -->  00:06:25,490

299

00:06:25,490  -->  00:06:28,540
to exclude this blue item from

300

00:06:28,540  -->  00:06:28,550

301

00:06:28,550  -->  00:06:30,159
our visualization. This blue item is called

302

00:06:30,159  -->  00:06:30,169

303

00:06:30,169  -->  00:06:33,030
city, that's what we're going to say here

304

00:06:33,030  -->  00:06:33,040

305

00:06:33,040  -->  00:06:36,660
City and then we're going to put a colon

306

00:06:36,660  -->  00:06:36,670

307

00:06:36,670  -->  00:06:40,290
because that's the syntax. So we're

308

00:06:40,290  -->  00:06:40,300

309

00:06:40,300  -->  00:06:43,350
saying use the same level of aggregation

310

00:06:43,350  -->  00:06:43,360

311

00:06:43,360  -->  00:06:47,970
as a visualization but exclude city if

312

00:06:47,970  -->  00:06:47,980

313

00:06:47,980  -->  00:06:50,250
that item is present if that dimension

314

00:06:50,250  -->  00:06:50,260

315

00:06:50,260  -->  00:06:52,980
is present in our aggregation. Good so

316

00:06:52,980  -->  00:06:52,990

317

00:06:52,990  -->  00:06:54,840
that's what Tableau will do and then what

318

00:06:54,840  -->  00:06:54,850

319

00:06:54,850  -->  00:06:57,780
it wants to do for their or what we want

320

00:06:57,780  -->  00:06:57,790

321

00:06:57,790  -->  00:07:00,150
it to do is we want to take the sum of

322

00:07:00,150  -->  00:07:00,160

323

00:07:00,160  -->  00:07:03,930
profit one take the sum of profit

324

00:07:03,930  -->  00:07:03,940

325

00:07:03,940  -->  00:07:06,570
after we've gone so after Tableau does

326

00:07:06,570  -->  00:07:06,580

327

00:07:06,580  -->  00:07:08,160
this in the background take the sum of

328

00:07:08,160  -->  00:07:08,170

329

00:07:08,170  -->  00:07:11,100
profit. Great, you've grabbed it now bring

330

00:07:11,100  -->  00:07:11,110

331

00:07:11,110  -->  00:07:13,680
it back to this visualization. That's

332

00:07:13,680  -->  00:07:13,690

333

00:07:13,690  -->  00:07:16,470
what this expression means and click Ok

334

00:07:16,470  -->  00:07:16,480

335

00:07:16,480  -->  00:07:18,900
you can see calculations valid and now

336

00:07:18,900  -->  00:07:18,910

337

00:07:18,910  -->  00:07:20,970
what we want to do is we're going to

338

00:07:20,970  -->  00:07:20,980

339

00:07:20,980  -->  00:07:23,580
replace our sum of profit with our

340

00:07:23,580  -->  00:07:23,590

341

00:07:23,590  -->  00:07:26,520
level of detail exclusive and this is

342

00:07:26,520  -->  00:07:26,530

343

00:07:26,530  -->  00:07:27,960
the interesting part.

344

00:07:27,960  -->  00:07:27,970

345

00:07:27,970  -->  00:07:30,690
This is or second interesting part this

346

00:07:30,690  -->  00:07:30,700

347

00:07:30,700  -->  00:07:32,310
is where we'll see something familiar,

348

00:07:32,310  -->  00:07:32,320

349

00:07:32,320  -->  00:07:35,340
so let's drag it into here,

350

00:07:35,340  -->  00:07:35,350

351

00:07:35,350  -->  00:07:38,430
yep do you see what happened? Do you see that

352

00:07:38,430  -->  00:07:38,440

353

00:07:38,440  -->  00:07:42,480
the ATTR appeared and let's drag it into

354

00:07:42,480  -->  00:07:42,490

355

00:07:42,490  -->  00:07:44,970
here as well so replace that. Again,

356

00:07:44,970  -->  00:07:44,980

357

00:07:44,980  -->  00:07:48,990
ATTR appeared once more. So first let's

358

00:07:48,990  -->  00:07:49,000

359

00:07:49,000  -->  00:07:51,420
quickly check that the visualization is

360

00:07:51,420  -->  00:07:51,430

361

00:07:51,430  -->  00:07:54,690
now correct right? So if I zoom in, I like

362

00:07:54,690  -->  00:07:54,700

363

00:07:54,700  -->  00:07:57,330
that how the both map zoom in, so you're

364

00:07:57,330  -->  00:07:57,340

365

00:07:57,340  -->  00:07:59,520
controlling it's very handy I think.

366

00:07:59,520  -->  00:07:59,530

367

00:07:59,530  -->  00:08:01,170
You're controlling two maps at the same

368

00:08:01,170  -->  00:08:01,180

369

00:08:01,180  -->  00:08:04,980
time, very cool. Anyway, so let's go to

370

00:08:04,980  -->  00:08:04,990

371

00:08:04,990  -->  00:08:06,960
North Dakota you can see that here now

372

00:08:06,960  -->  00:08:06,970

373

00:08:06,970  -->  00:08:09,450
all of them have this 7,002 and even

374

00:08:09,450  -->  00:08:09,460

375

00:08:09,460  -->  00:08:10,710
though this one's not showing, you can just

376

00:08:10,710  -->  00:08:10,720

377

00:08:10,720  -->  00:08:13,770
right-click and not annotates just say

378

00:08:13,770  -->  00:08:13,780

379

00:08:13,780  -->  00:08:16,080
all the show from mark label it wasn't

380

00:08:16,080  -->  00:08:16,090

381

00:08:16,090  -->  00:08:17,430
showing because it's like overlapping

382

00:08:17,430  -->  00:08:17,440

383

00:08:17,440  -->  00:08:19,020
but there that's better. So you can see

384

00:08:19,020  -->  00:08:19,030

385

00:08:19,030  -->  00:08:22,410
that they all have 7,002 right or you can

386

00:08:22,410  -->  00:08:22,420

387

00:08:22,420  -->  00:08:24,780
you get the same color as opposed to

388

00:08:24,780  -->  00:08:24,790

389

00:08:24,790  -->  00:08:26,760
here. There are different or you can

390

00:08:26,760  -->  00:08:26,770

391

00:08:26,770  -->  00:08:29,040
scroll over to California and you can

392

00:08:29,040  -->  00:08:29,050

393

00:08:29,050  -->  00:08:31,440
see that over here all of them have

394

00:08:31,440  -->  00:08:31,450

395

00:08:31,450  -->  00:08:35,820
the same value which is 29,715,

396

00:08:35,820  -->  00:08:35,830

397

00:08:35,830  -->  00:08:39,510
the LOD exclude state profit, so this

398

00:08:39,510  -->  00:08:39,520

399

00:08:39,520  -->  00:08:41,040
shows us that we have achieved the

400

00:08:41,040  -->  00:08:41,050

401

00:08:41,050  -->  00:08:43,020
result that we wanted and every single

402

00:08:43,020  -->  00:08:43,030

403

00:08:43,030  -->  00:08:45,960
state we have been able to

404

00:08:45,960  -->  00:08:45,970

405

00:08:45,970  -->  00:08:48,030
capture the profit of the state and

406

00:08:48,030  -->  00:08:48,040

407

00:08:48,040  -->  00:08:50,819
bring it down to this more detailed

408

00:08:50,819  -->  00:08:50,829

409

00:08:50,829  -->  00:08:53,160
visualization which includes city and

410

00:08:53,160  -->  00:08:53,170

411

00:08:53,170  -->  00:08:56,040
display it there. So that's, that's a great

412

00:08:56,040  -->  00:08:56,050

413

00:08:56,050  -->  00:08:58,319
result congratulations on that. The only

414

00:08:58,319  -->  00:08:58,329

415

00:08:58,329  -->  00:09:01,290
question we have left is why is this

416

00:09:01,290  -->  00:09:01,300

417

00:09:01,300  -->  00:09:04,230
ATTR applied here? Well the answer is

418

00:09:04,230  -->  00:09:04,240

419

00:09:04,240  -->  00:09:06,569
actually rather simple, the answer is that

420

00:09:06,569  -->  00:09:06,579

421

00:09:06,579  -->  00:09:10,679
ATTR is applied because we need a level

422

00:09:10,679  -->  00:09:10,689

423

00:09:10,689  -->  00:09:14,280
we need some aggregation to occur so the

424

00:09:14,280  -->  00:09:14,290

425

00:09:14,290  -->  00:09:18,090
way Tableau works is we have a level of

426

00:09:18,090  -->  00:09:18,100

427

00:09:18,100  -->  00:09:20,970
granularity or level of detail for our

428

00:09:20,970  -->  00:09:20,980

429

00:09:20,980  -->  00:09:23,220
visualization and then all measures

430

00:09:23,220  -->  00:09:23,230

431

00:09:23,230  -->  00:09:26,730
should be aggregated at that level but

432

00:09:26,730  -->  00:09:26,740

433

00:09:26,740  -->  00:09:29,189
now there's a bit of a conundrum because

434

00:09:29,189  -->  00:09:29,199

435

00:09:29,199  -->  00:09:33,389
the LOD this few, this measure that

436

00:09:33,389  -->  00:09:33,399

437

00:09:33,399  -->  00:09:36,480
we're using LOD exclude state profit so

438

00:09:36,480  -->  00:09:36,490

439

00:09:36,490  -->  00:09:38,999
this measure actually comes from a

440

00:09:38,999  -->  00:09:39,009

441

00:09:39,009  -->  00:09:43,259
higher level of aggregation so from the

442

00:09:43,259  -->  00:09:43,269

443

00:09:43,269  -->  00:09:45,569
lower level of granularity it's coming

444

00:09:45,569  -->  00:09:45,579

445

00:09:45,579  -->  00:09:47,009
it's coming from this state

446

00:09:47,009  -->  00:09:47,019

447

00:09:47,019  -->  00:09:49,439
visualization so I'm just going to

448

00:09:49,439  -->  00:09:49,449

449

00:09:49,449  -->  00:09:51,629
remove city here so it's coming from

450

00:09:51,629  -->  00:09:51,639

451

00:09:51,639  -->  00:09:54,090
here right so and the thing is that

452

00:09:54,090  -->  00:09:54,100

453

00:09:54,100  -->  00:09:56,759
there's no point and there's no meaning

454

00:09:56,759  -->  00:09:56,769

455

00:09:56,769  -->  00:10:00,569
in aggregating this value 7,002

456

00:10:00,569  -->  00:10:00,579

457

00:10:00,579  -->  00:10:03,269
at the, at the city level

458

00:10:03,269  -->  00:10:03,279

459

00:10:03,279  -->  00:10:06,090
because it doesn't come so you when you

460

00:10:06,090  -->  00:10:06,100

461

00:10:06,100  -->  00:10:07,530
can when you aggregate, you aggregate

462

00:10:07,530  -->  00:10:07,540

463

00:10:07,540  -->  00:10:09,240
something like they say in the city

464

00:10:09,240  -->  00:10:09,250

465

00:10:09,250  -->  00:10:12,299
there's 50 orders, then you aggregate

466

00:10:12,299  -->  00:10:12,309

467

00:10:12,309  -->  00:10:14,519
them and you get a value that's what

468

00:10:14,519  -->  00:10:14,529

469

00:10:14,529  -->  00:10:17,189
aggregation is. That's when you use a sum

470

00:10:17,189  -->  00:10:17,199

471

00:10:17,199  -->  00:10:20,280
or average or a maximum or minimum sum

472

00:10:20,280  -->  00:10:20,290

473

00:10:20,290  -->  00:10:21,660
one of those functions but when

474

00:10:21,660  -->  00:10:21,670

475

00:10:21,670  -->  00:10:24,389
something is coming from a higher level

476

00:10:24,389  -->  00:10:24,399

477

00:10:24,399  -->  00:10:26,699
of aggregation so it is something is

478

00:10:26,699  -->  00:10:26,709

479

00:10:26,709  -->  00:10:29,340
already, even more aggregated than

480

00:10:29,340  -->  00:10:29,350

481

00:10:29,350  -->  00:10:30,929
your view so it's coming from the state

482

00:10:30,929  -->  00:10:30,939

483

00:10:30,939  -->  00:10:34,379
level to the city level then there is no

484

00:10:34,379  -->  00:10:34,389

485

00:10:34,389  -->  00:10:37,199
meaning in aggregating it because it is

486

00:10:37,199  -->  00:10:37,209

487

00:10:37,209  -->  00:10:41,850
unique for that this value 7,002 is it's

488

00:10:41,850  -->  00:10:41,860

489

00:10:41,860  -->  00:10:43,769
just that one value is unique for this

490

00:10:43,769  -->  00:10:43,779

491

00:10:43,779  -->  00:10:46,710
city it's you it's so this city doesn't

492

00:10:46,710  -->  00:10:46,720

493

00:10:46,720  -->  00:10:49,769
have more than one state that it belongs

494

00:10:49,769  -->  00:10:49,779

495

00:10:49,779  -->  00:10:52,319
to right only belongs to one state. Each

496

00:10:52,319  -->  00:10:52,329

497

00:10:52,329  -->  00:10:54,210
one of these any city belongs to only

498

00:10:54,210  -->  00:10:54,220

499

00:10:54,220  -->  00:10:56,100
one state so by default it will just get

500

00:10:56,100  -->  00:10:56,110

501

00:10:56,110  -->  00:10:57,660
that one value and there's no point in

502

00:10:57,660  -->  00:10:57,670

503

00:10:57,670  -->  00:10:59,129
doing the sum and that's what the

504

00:10:59,129  -->  00:10:59,470

505

00:10:59,470  -->  00:11:03,510
ATTR is telling us it's just saying that

506

00:11:03,510  -->  00:11:03,520

507

00:11:03,520  -->  00:11:05,940
ok cool we're just going to take the

508

00:11:05,940  -->  00:11:05,950

509

00:11:05,950  -->  00:11:07,680
value that we get from here and we just

510

00:11:07,680  -->  00:11:07,690

511

00:11:07,690  -->  00:11:10,710
going to apply it to the cities and

512

00:11:10,710  -->  00:11:10,720

513

00:11:10,720  -->  00:11:11,970
that's why when we were talking about

514

00:11:11,970  -->  00:11:11,980

515

00:11:11,980  -->  00:11:14,640
the ATTR that's why I mentioned that what

516

00:11:14,640  -->  00:11:14,650

517

00:11:14,650  -->  00:11:17,040
it does it actually applies or pastes the

518

00:11:17,040  -->  00:11:17,050

519

00:11:17,050  -->  00:11:20,460
value and it's so, this is similar to the

520

00:11:20,460  -->  00:11:20,470

521

00:11:20,470  -->  00:11:22,890
example when previously in our ATTR

522

00:11:22,890  -->  00:11:22,900

523

00:11:22,900  -->  00:11:25,110
investigation we took for the states.

524

00:11:25,110  -->  00:11:25,120

525

00:11:25,120  -->  00:11:28,050
What we did is we took country right we

526

00:11:28,050  -->  00:11:28,060

527

00:11:28,060  -->  00:11:30,030
took country and we put it into a

528

00:11:30,030  -->  00:11:30,040

529

00:11:30,040  -->  00:11:33,120
tooltip same thing ATTR of country was

530

00:11:33,120  -->  00:11:33,130

531

00:11:33,130  -->  00:11:35,550
applied because country actually comes

532

00:11:35,550  -->  00:11:35,560

533

00:11:35,560  -->  00:11:38,520
from here. Country comes from here

534

00:11:38,520  -->  00:11:38,530

535

00:11:38,530  -->  00:11:41,910
and it's a higher level of aggregation

536

00:11:41,910  -->  00:11:41,920

537

00:11:41,920  -->  00:11:45,690
and therefore there's no point in doing

538

00:11:45,690  -->  00:11:45,700

539

00:11:45,700  -->  00:11:47,400
a sum or anything but in this case it

540

00:11:47,400  -->  00:11:47,410

541

00:11:47,410  -->  00:11:48,900
was it wasn't even a measured with the

542

00:11:48,900  -->  00:11:48,910

543

00:11:48,910  -->  00:11:51,510
damage the only differences that now

544

00:11:51,510  -->  00:11:51,520

545

00:11:51,520  -->  00:11:53,940
we're dealing with measures it and

546

00:11:53,940  -->  00:11:53,950

547

00:11:53,950  -->  00:11:55,260
therefore might be a bit confusing but

548

00:11:55,260  -->  00:11:55,270

549

00:11:55,270  -->  00:11:56,820
principles the same that we're taking

550

00:11:56,820  -->  00:11:56,830

551

00:11:56,830  -->  00:11:59,400
something from a higher from an even

552

00:11:59,400  -->  00:11:59,410

553

00:11:59,410  -->  00:12:03,450
higher level of aggregation and

554

00:12:03,450  -->  00:12:03,460

555

00:12:03,460  -->  00:12:06,210
therefore ATTR is applied and I'll

556

00:12:06,210  -->  00:12:06,220

557

00:12:06,220  -->  00:12:08,940
demonstrate to you that it's is just the

558

00:12:08,940  -->  00:12:08,950

559

00:12:08,950  -->  00:12:11,820
way the Tableau specifies or and helps

560

00:12:11,820  -->  00:12:11,830

561

00:12:11,830  -->  00:12:12,990
you understand what's going on.

562

00:12:12,990  -->  00:12:13,000

563

00:12:13,000  -->  00:12:15,960
You can simply here just select measure

564

00:12:15,960  -->  00:12:15,970

565

00:12:15,970  -->  00:12:19,710
and changes this to sum and change this to

566

00:12:19,710  -->  00:12:19,720

567

00:12:19,720  -->  00:12:21,780
sum as well and nothing will change.

568

00:12:21,780  -->  00:12:21,790

569

00:12:21,790  -->  00:12:24,030
Why? Because well yes you are performing

570

00:12:24,030  -->  00:12:24,040

571

00:12:24,040  -->  00:12:25,590
an aggregation but you only have one

572

00:12:25,590  -->  00:12:25,600

573

00:12:25,600  -->  00:12:27,600
value your only summing across one

574

00:12:27,600  -->  00:12:27,610

575

00:12:27,610  -->  00:12:31,050
value which is 7,002 for the let's say

576

00:12:31,050  -->  00:12:31,060

577

00:12:31,060  -->  00:12:33,660
for this city, Mandan, the value 7,002,

578

00:12:33,660  -->  00:12:33,670

579

00:12:33,670  -->  00:12:36,780
and you summing 7,002, that's

580

00:12:36,780  -->  00:12:36,790

581

00:12:36,790  -->  00:12:38,310
it. There's no other value take the

582

00:12:38,310  -->  00:12:38,320

583

00:12:38,320  -->  00:12:41,070
average nothing will change again. So

584

00:12:41,070  -->  00:12:41,080

585

00:12:41,080  -->  00:12:45,180
therefore ATTR is applied because if

586

00:12:45,180  -->  00:12:45,190

587

00:12:45,190  -->  00:12:48,450
this value is coming from a higher level

588

00:12:48,450  -->  00:12:48,460

589

00:12:48,460  -->  00:12:50,790
of aggregation. Ok so hopefully that

590

00:12:50,790  -->  00:12:50,800

591

00:12:50,800  -->  00:12:52,620
makes sense?

592

00:12:52,620  -->  00:12:52,630

593

00:12:52,630  -->  00:12:54,810
It might say you take some time to get

594

00:12:54,810  -->  00:12:54,820

595

00:12:54,820  -->  00:12:57,930
used to ATTR but at least now we know

596

00:12:57,930  -->  00:12:57,940

597

00:12:57,940  -->  00:13:01,020
where it comes from and how it works and

598

00:13:01,020  -->  00:13:01,030

599

00:13:01,030  -->  00:13:04,740
also we have successfully applied our

600

00:13:04,740  -->  00:13:04,750

601

00:13:04,750  -->  00:13:08,310
level of detail calculation which is

602

00:13:08,310  -->  00:13:08,320

603

00:13:08,320  -->  00:13:10,800
exclude, now for now this was part one

604

00:13:10,800  -->  00:13:10,810

605

00:13:10,810  -->  00:13:12,090
because we only

606

00:13:12,090  -->  00:13:12,100

607

00:13:12,100  -->  00:13:14,999
got those values and this is quite a

608

00:13:14,999  -->  00:13:15,009

609

00:13:15,009  -->  00:13:18,030
useless visualization for at this stage

610

00:13:18,030  -->  00:13:18,040

611

00:13:18,040  -->  00:13:20,129
so what's the point of having this

612

00:13:20,129  -->  00:13:20,139

613

00:13:20,139  -->  00:13:23,009
profit for the state at level the city.

614

00:13:23,009  -->  00:13:23,019

615

00:13:23,019  -->  00:13:26,280
Well in part two, we will see how to

616

00:13:26,280  -->  00:13:26,290

617

00:13:26,290  -->  00:13:28,530
actually how we're going to use it in

618

00:13:28,530  -->  00:13:28,540

619

00:13:28,540  -->  00:13:31,050
our visualization. How we actually to

620

00:13:31,050  -->  00:13:31,060

621

00:13:31,060  -->  00:13:34,019
make this formula useful to give us

622

00:13:34,019  -->  00:13:34,029

623

00:13:34,029  -->  00:13:36,420
insights and I look forward to next time.

624

00:13:36,420  -->  00:13:36,430

625

00:13:36,430  -->  00:13:43,529
Until then, happy analyzing!
