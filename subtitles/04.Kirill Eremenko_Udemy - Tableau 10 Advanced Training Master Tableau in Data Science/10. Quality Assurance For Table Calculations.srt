00:00:02,850  -->  00:00:07,039
Welcome back to the advanced course on

2

00:00:07,039  -->  00:00:07,049

3

00:00:07,049  -->  00:00:09,170
Tableau. In the previous tutorials we did

4

00:00:09,170  -->  00:00:09,180

5

00:00:09,180  -->  00:00:11,299
most of the groundwork and created this

6

00:00:11,299  -->  00:00:11,309

7

00:00:11,309  -->  00:00:13,220
wonderful visual which will help us

8

00:00:13,220  -->  00:00:13,230

9

00:00:13,230  -->  00:00:15,619
identify which machines require

10

00:00:15,619  -->  00:00:15,629

11

00:00:15,629  -->  00:00:19,220
servicing and maintenance. Now, in today's

12

00:00:19,220  -->  00:00:19,230

13

00:00:19,230  -->  00:00:21,890
tutorial we're going to look at a few

14

00:00:21,890  -->  00:00:21,900

15

00:00:21,900  -->  00:00:23,510
quality assurance steps that we can take

16

00:00:23,510  -->  00:00:23,520

17

00:00:23,520  -->  00:00:26,450
to make sure that the insights that

18

00:00:26,450  -->  00:00:26,460

19

00:00:26,460  -->  00:00:27,770
we're going to be conveying are

20

00:00:27,770  -->  00:00:27,780

21

00:00:27,780  -->  00:00:30,529
definitely correct. For instance, I'll

22

00:00:30,529  -->  00:00:30,539

23

00:00:30,539  -->  00:00:32,299
show you an example, like here you can

24

00:00:32,299  -->  00:00:32,309

25

00:00:32,309  -->  00:00:34,220
see right away that this machine does

26

00:00:34,220  -->  00:00:34,230

27

00:00:34,230  -->  00:00:37,040
look like it requires maintenance. This

28

00:00:37,040  -->  00:00:37,050

29

00:00:37,050  -->  00:00:38,509
machine probably doesn't require

30

00:00:38,509  -->  00:00:38,519

31

00:00:38,519  -->  00:00:41,360
maintenance. This machine does spike over

32

00:00:41,360  -->  00:00:41,370

33

00:00:41,370  -->  00:00:43,099
the ten percent line it does look like it

34

00:00:43,099  -->  00:00:43,109

35

00:00:43,109  -->  00:00:44,239
requires maintenance but we'll talk

36

00:00:44,239  -->  00:00:44,249

37

00:00:44,249  -->  00:00:47,959
about that separately. But also here you

38

00:00:47,959  -->  00:00:47,969

39

00:00:47,969  -->  00:00:49,639
can see that these machines they're

40

00:00:49,639  -->  00:00:49,649

41

00:00:49,649  -->  00:00:52,819
green sr1 and sr4 a and the red

42

00:00:52,819  -->  00:00:52,829

43

00:00:52,829  -->  00:00:54,799
they do spike over the ten percent line

44

00:00:54,799  -->  00:00:54,809

45

00:00:54,809  -->  00:00:56,090
you can see that here and you can see

46

00:00:56,090  -->  00:00:56,100

47

00:00:56,100  -->  00:00:56,809
that here.

48

00:00:56,809  -->  00:00:56,819

49

00:00:56,819  -->  00:01:01,369
However it does feel somewhat not normal

50

00:01:01,369  -->  00:01:01,379

51

00:01:01,379  -->  00:01:04,009
like this spike doesn't feel that it is

52

00:01:04,009  -->  00:01:04,019

53

00:01:04,019  -->  00:01:07,039
entirely attributed to the fact that

54

00:01:07,039  -->  00:01:07,049

55

00:01:07,049  -->  00:01:09,170
mission the machine is underperforming

56

00:01:09,170  -->  00:01:09,180

57

00:01:09,180  -->  00:01:11,450
and requires maintenance it looks like

58

00:01:11,450  -->  00:01:11,460

59

00:01:11,460  -->  00:01:13,760
there might be a chance that this spike

60

00:01:13,760  -->  00:01:13,770

61

00:01:13,770  -->  00:01:15,590
is an irregularity just like this one

62

00:01:15,590  -->  00:01:15,600

63

00:01:15,600  -->  00:01:17,389
caused by the fact that we don't have

64

00:01:17,389  -->  00:01:17,399

65

00:01:17,399  -->  00:01:19,219
any data here and we don't have any

66

00:01:19,219  -->  00:01:19,229

67

00:01:19,229  -->  00:01:21,980
data here. So the lack of data for

68

00:01:21,980  -->  00:01:21,990

69

00:01:21,990  -->  00:01:24,950
these periods might somehow be causing

70

00:01:24,950  -->  00:01:24,960

71

00:01:24,960  -->  00:01:27,289
the spike and therefore we have to

72

00:01:27,289  -->  00:01:27,299

73

00:01:27,299  -->  00:01:29,120
investigate this further to understand

74

00:01:29,120  -->  00:01:29,130

75

00:01:29,130  -->  00:01:32,029
maybe we need to somehow fix our charts

76

00:01:32,029  -->  00:01:32,039

77

00:01:32,039  -->  00:01:35,419
so that these spikes go away and we report

78

00:01:35,419  -->  00:01:35,429

79

00:01:35,429  -->  00:01:39,050
only the true faulty machines or the

80

00:01:39,050  -->  00:01:39,060

81

00:01:39,060  -->  00:01:41,840
true truly underperforming machines that

82

00:01:41,840  -->  00:01:41,850

83

00:01:41,850  -->  00:01:43,190
require maintenance.

84

00:01:43,190  -->  00:01:43,200

85

00:01:43,200  -->  00:01:45,349
Alright so to understand this better

86

00:01:45,349  -->  00:01:45,359

87

00:01:45,359  -->  00:01:46,910
what's going on here and here.

88

00:01:46,910  -->  00:01:46,920

89

00:01:46,920  -->  00:01:50,120
Let's go to the data so here's the coal

90

00:01:50,120  -->  00:01:50,130

91

00:01:50,130  -->  00:01:52,429
terminal data and let's find one of

92

00:01:52,429  -->  00:01:52,439

93

00:01:52,439  -->  00:01:53,779
these machines. So let's start with this

94

00:01:53,779  -->  00:01:53,789

95

00:01:53,789  -->  00:01:56,480
green one for instance SR1 and this

96

00:01:56,480  -->  00:01:56,490

97

00:01:56,490  -->  00:02:00,169
happened at 12am. So let's go ahead and

98

00:02:00,169  -->  00:02:00,179

99

00:02:00,179  -->  00:02:03,620
find that one SR1 and if I just scroll

100

00:02:03,620  -->  00:02:03,630

101

00:02:03,630  -->  00:02:05,510
down so I might zoom in a bit so we can

102

00:02:05,510  -->  00:02:05,520

103

00:02:05,520  -->  00:02:09,230
see better, September 17.

104

00:02:09,230  -->  00:02:09,240

105

00:02:09,240  -->  00:02:12,020
There we go, SR1 so as you can see here

106

00:02:12,020  -->  00:02:12,030

107

00:02:12,030  -->  00:02:15,050
what's going on is that we don't have

108

00:02:15,050  -->  00:02:15,060

109

00:02:15,060  -->  00:02:16,190
any data

110

00:02:16,190  -->  00:02:16,200

111

00:02:16,200  -->  00:02:17,960
for September's 16th right? So it only

112

00:02:17,960  -->  00:02:17,970

113

00:02:17,970  -->  00:02:20,360
starts September 12, so basically what

114

00:02:20,360  -->  00:02:20,370

115

00:02:20,370  -->  00:02:22,369
we're seeing in our visual I'll just add

116

00:02:22,369  -->  00:02:22,379

117

00:02:22,379  -->  00:02:25,190
some rows here as we see all this blank

118

00:02:25,190  -->  00:02:25,200

119

00:02:25,200  -->  00:02:27,740
space in fact I'll just add a bit more rows.

120

00:02:27,740  -->  00:02:27,750

121

00:02:27,750  -->  00:02:30,320
So we're seeing this blank, this blanks

122

00:02:30,320  -->  00:02:30,330

123

00:02:30,330  -->  00:02:31,729
and there's a lot more blanks because is

124

00:02:31,729  -->  00:02:31,739

125

00:02:31,739  -->  00:02:35,960
there's basically 13, 14, 15, 4 days

126

00:02:35,960  -->  00:02:35,970

127

00:02:35,970  -->  00:02:40,220
missing so 4 times 24 bars are missing

128

00:02:40,220  -->  00:02:40,230

129

00:02:40,230  -->  00:02:44,839
or from this chart. So how does this spike

130

00:02:44,839  -->  00:02:44,849

131

00:02:44,849  -->  00:02:46,970
come to be. Well what's happening is

132

00:02:46,970  -->  00:02:46,980

133

00:02:46,980  -->  00:02:48,860
we're applying a moving average right

134

00:02:48,860  -->  00:02:48,870

135

00:02:48,870  -->  00:02:50,539
but we're applying the moving average to

136

00:02:50,539  -->  00:02:50,549

137

00:02:50,549  -->  00:02:52,699
idle capacity so let's perform these

138

00:02:52,699  -->  00:02:52,709

139

00:02:52,709  -->  00:02:55,039
calculations here as well and this is

140

00:02:55,039  -->  00:02:55,049

141

00:02:55,049  -->  00:02:57,020
actually the second thing that we wanted

142

00:02:57,020  -->  00:02:57,030

143

00:02:57,030  -->  00:02:58,880
to talk about in this tutorial how to

144

00:02:58,880  -->  00:02:58,890

145

00:02:58,890  -->  00:03:01,280
perform quality assurance on your Tableau

146

00:03:01,280  -->  00:03:01,290

147

00:03:01,290  -->  00:03:02,300
calculations.

148

00:03:02,300  -->  00:03:02,310

149

00:03:02,310  -->  00:03:03,680
Well basically we're going to recreate

150

00:03:03,680  -->  00:03:03,690

151

00:03:03,690  -->  00:03:06,229
the Tableau calculation now in our data

152

00:03:06,229  -->  00:03:06,239

153

00:03:06,239  -->  00:03:08,660
over here. So to start off with let's

154

00:03:08,660  -->  00:03:08,670

155

00:03:08,670  -->  00:03:10,460
recreate the table calculation somewhere

156

00:03:10,460  -->  00:03:10,470

157

00:03:10,470  -->  00:03:13,339
at the start. We'll say this is going to

158

00:03:13,339  -->  00:03:13,349

159

00:03:13,349  -->  00:03:17,360
be 0% difference right so how is

160

00:03:17,360  -->  00:03:17,370

161

00:03:17,370  -->  00:03:19,039
the percent difference calculated? We

162

00:03:19,039  -->  00:03:19,049

163

00:03:19,049  -->  00:03:22,520
have to take actual tons minus nominal

164

00:03:22,520  -->  00:03:22,530

165

00:03:22,530  -->  00:03:27,319
capacity and divide it by normal capacity and I'm

166

00:03:27,319  -->  00:03:27,329

167

00:03:27,329  -->  00:03:28,910
just going to copy this down a little

168

00:03:28,910  -->  00:03:28,920

169

00:03:28,920  -->  00:03:32,210
bit and then what we did is we took the

170

00:03:32,210  -->  00:03:32,220

171

00:03:32,220  -->  00:03:36,440
positive to send difference and we said

172

00:03:36,440  -->  00:03:36,450

173

00:03:36,450  -->  00:03:40,759
this is going to be the percent

174

00:03:40,759  -->  00:03:40,769

175

00:03:40,769  -->  00:03:45,650
difference times minus one. So just make it

176

00:03:45,650  -->  00:03:45,660

177

00:03:45,660  -->  00:03:48,289
positive and then we applied an

178

00:03:48,289  -->  00:03:48,299

179

00:03:48,299  -->  00:03:50,599
eight-hour moving average to the

180

00:03:50,599  -->  00:03:50,609

181

00:03:50,609  -->  00:03:52,190
positive percent difference. So let's say

182

00:03:52,190  -->  00:03:52,200

183

00:03:52,200  -->  00:03:56,059
MA here and what we're going to do is

184

00:03:56,059  -->  00:03:56,069

185

00:03:56,069  -->  00:03:57,259
let's say let's take this one for

186

00:03:57,259  -->  00:03:57,269

187

00:03:57,269  -->  00:04:00,979
instance, we'll say average of these bars.

188

00:04:00,979  -->  00:04:00,989

189

00:04:00,989  -->  00:04:02,210
So I'm going to select eight

190

00:04:02,210  -->  00:04:02,220

191

00:04:02,220  -->  00:04:04,789
values here, the first this current one

192

00:04:04,789  -->  00:04:04,799

193

00:04:04,799  -->  00:04:06,470
and the seven previous ones as you

194

00:04:06,470  -->  00:04:06,480

195

00:04:06,480  -->  00:04:08,150
remember in our data that's what we

196

00:04:08,150  -->  00:04:08,160

197

00:04:08,160  -->  00:04:09,199
did.

198

00:04:09,199  -->  00:04:09,209

199

00:04:09,209  -->  00:04:12,979
So there we go, that's our average. Now

200

00:04:12,979  -->  00:04:12,989

201

00:04:12,989  -->  00:04:15,440
I'm going to copy this up, so here you

202

00:04:15,440  -->  00:04:15,450

203

00:04:15,450  -->  00:04:17,089
can see that's our average for those bars,

204

00:04:17,089  -->  00:04:17,099

205

00:04:17,099  -->  00:04:18,979
here you can see that's our average and

206

00:04:18,979  -->  00:04:18,989

207

00:04:18,989  -->  00:04:21,650
I've copied here what is taking its

208

00:04:21,650  -->  00:04:21,660

209

00:04:21,660  -->  00:04:23,510
taking of the wrong values in fact if I

210

00:04:23,510  -->  00:04:23,520

211

00:04:23,520  -->  00:04:25,730
start copying further is gonna

212

00:04:25,730  -->  00:04:25,740

213

00:04:25,740  -->  00:04:27,529
incorrect reference because there is

214

00:04:27,529  -->  00:04:27,539

215

00:04:27,539  -->  00:04:29,629
nothing to take into account so the

216

00:04:29,629  -->  00:04:29,639

217

00:04:29,639  -->  00:04:32,300
these ones we can calculate a moving

218

00:04:32,300  -->  00:04:32,310

219

00:04:32,310  -->  00:04:34,129
average for these ones because we just

220

00:04:34,129  -->  00:04:34,139

221

00:04:34,139  -->  00:04:36,920
don't have enough bars to calculate the

222

00:04:36,920  -->  00:04:36,930

223

00:04:36,930  -->  00:04:38,420
moving average. So let's leave them for

224

00:04:38,420  -->  00:04:38,430

225

00:04:38,430  -->  00:04:38,839
now,

226

00:04:38,839  -->  00:04:38,849

227

00:04:38,849  -->  00:04:41,989
now let's copy this further down so as

228

00:04:41,989  -->  00:04:41,999

229

00:04:41,999  -->  00:04:43,610
you can see as I'm copying down the

230

00:04:43,610  -->  00:04:43,620

231

00:04:43,620  -->  00:04:45,230
moving average is running along with the

232

00:04:45,230  -->  00:04:45,240

233

00:04:45,240  -->  00:04:46,459
data and that's why it's called the

234

00:04:46,459  -->  00:04:46,469

235

00:04:46,469  -->  00:04:48,499
moving average so I'm just going to copy

236

00:04:48,499  -->  00:04:48,509

237

00:04:48,509  -->  00:04:52,159
it all the way down to our gap so it

238

00:04:52,159  -->  00:04:52,169

239

00:04:52,169  -->  00:04:54,260
went all the way down to 12th of September

240

00:04:54,260  -->  00:04:54,270

241

00:04:54,270  -->  00:04:56,029
and it stopped here. So now what will

242

00:04:56,029  -->  00:04:56,039

243

00:04:56,039  -->  00:04:58,550
happen if I copy this information or

244

00:04:58,550  -->  00:04:58,560

245

00:04:58,560  -->  00:05:00,170
these formulas for the 17th of

246

00:05:00,170  -->  00:05:00,180

247

00:05:00,180  -->  00:05:01,939
September and then I just gotta keep

248

00:05:01,939  -->  00:05:01,949

249

00:05:01,949  -->  00:05:04,309
copying them down like that. So obviously

250

00:05:04,309  -->  00:05:04,319

251

00:05:04,319  -->  00:05:05,959
this is calculated correctly. It's taking

252

00:05:05,959  -->  00:05:05,969

253

00:05:05,969  -->  00:05:07,999
these two values into account. This is

254

00:05:07,999  -->  00:05:08,009

255

00:05:08,009  -->  00:05:09,769
calculated correctly as well, however,

256

00:05:09,769  -->  00:05:09,779

257

00:05:09,779  -->  00:05:12,920
this this average is taking these blanks

258

00:05:12,920  -->  00:05:12,930

259

00:05:12,930  -->  00:05:15,800
and then the value into its calculation.

260

00:05:15,800  -->  00:05:15,810

261

00:05:15,810  -->  00:05:17,990
This this average is only taking two

262

00:05:17,990  -->  00:05:18,000

263

00:05:18,000  -->  00:05:20,059
values and then it taking six blanks. This

264

00:05:20,059  -->  00:05:20,069

265

00:05:20,069  -->  00:05:25,459
this next value here is taking three

266

00:05:25,459  -->  00:05:25,469

267

00:05:25,469  -->  00:05:28,129
values and it's taking four blank a 5

268

00:05:28,129  -->  00:05:28,139

269

00:05:28,139  -->  00:05:30,110
blanks into account. So as you can see,

270

00:05:30,110  -->  00:05:30,120

271

00:05:30,120  -->  00:05:33,890
the first eight bars here will be the

272

00:05:33,890  -->  00:05:33,900

273

00:05:33,900  -->  00:05:35,929
first eight averages that we calculate

274

00:05:35,929  -->  00:05:35,939

275

00:05:35,939  -->  00:05:37,909
or the first seven averages there will

276

00:05:37,909  -->  00:05:37,919

277

00:05:37,919  -->  00:05:42,260
be taking at least one blank value into

278

00:05:42,260  -->  00:05:42,270

279

00:05:42,270  -->  00:05:43,850
account their calculations. So therefore

280

00:05:43,850  -->  00:05:43,860

281

00:05:43,860  -->  00:05:45,230
the only kind of calculating correctly

282

00:05:45,230  -->  00:05:45,240

283

00:05:45,240  -->  00:05:47,809
and as you can see here we get the 0.136.

284

00:05:47,809  -->  00:05:47,819

285

00:05:47,819  -->  00:05:49,760
Let's see what we have in our chart.

286

00:05:49,760  -->  00:05:49,770

287

00:05:49,770  -->  00:05:52,790
On our chart we have 0.136, you can sit

288

00:05:52,790  -->  00:05:52,800

289

00:05:52,800  -->  00:05:56,450
over here so 0.136 how did we get that?

290

00:05:56,450  -->  00:05:56,460

291

00:05:56,460  -->  00:05:58,700
Well that is exactly because of the

292

00:05:58,700  -->  00:05:58,710

293

00:05:58,710  -->  00:06:01,459
blanks our average is actually equal to

294

00:06:01,459  -->  00:06:01,469

295

00:06:01,469  -->  00:06:04,189
the value on during that hour. So

296

00:06:04,189  -->  00:06:04,199

297

00:06:04,199  -->  00:06:05,749
therefore such an average is just

298

00:06:05,749  -->  00:06:05,759

299

00:06:05,759  -->  00:06:09,889
displaying the value of the percent

300

00:06:09,889  -->  00:06:09,899

301

00:06:09,899  -->  00:06:11,420
difference the percent difference

302

00:06:11,420  -->  00:06:11,430

303

00:06:11,430  -->  00:06:13,219
that we calculated for the idle capacity

304

00:06:13,219  -->  00:06:13,229

305

00:06:13,229  -->  00:06:15,350
for that specific hour and that's not

306

00:06:15,350  -->  00:06:15,360

307

00:06:15,360  -->  00:06:17,420
what we want. It doesn't fit our criteria,

308

00:06:17,420  -->  00:06:17,430

309

00:06:17,430  -->  00:06:20,089
it's not an average for 8 hours. In fact we

310

00:06:20,089  -->  00:06:20,099

311

00:06:20,099  -->  00:06:22,040
can calculate an average for 8 hours here

312

00:06:22,040  -->  00:06:22,050

313

00:06:22,050  -->  00:06:25,429
because we don't have the data. Similar

314

00:06:25,429  -->  00:06:25,439

315

00:06:25,439  -->  00:06:27,800
situations apply at the start, as we

316

00:06:27,800  -->  00:06:27,810

317

00:06:27,810  -->  00:06:29,089
discussed that you cannot

318

00:06:29,089  -->  00:06:29,099

319

00:06:29,099  -->  00:06:31,040
calculate the average because you just

320

00:06:31,040  -->  00:06:31,050

321

00:06:31,050  -->  00:06:33,920
simply don't have the data and the

322

00:06:33,920  -->  00:06:33,930

323

00:06:33,930  -->  00:06:35,779
similar situation applies here and here.

324

00:06:35,779  -->  00:06:35,789

325

00:06:35,789  -->  00:06:37,309
So here we just got lucky that the

326

00:06:37,309  -->  00:06:37,319

327

00:06:37,319  -->  00:06:38,380
averages were there,

328

00:06:38,380  -->  00:06:38,390

329

00:06:38,390  -->  00:06:40,600
idle capacity for that hours was very low

330

00:06:40,600  -->  00:06:40,610

331

00:06:40,610  -->  00:06:41,980
and therefore the average is low but

332

00:06:41,980  -->  00:06:41,990

333

00:06:41,990  -->  00:06:44,800
here in contrast we can see that the

334

00:06:44,800  -->  00:06:44,810

335

00:06:44,810  -->  00:06:47,710
idle capacity here was above ten percent

336

00:06:47,710  -->  00:06:47,720

337

00:06:47,720  -->  00:06:49,690
and therefore the average is above ten

338

00:06:49,690  -->  00:06:49,700

339

00:06:49,700  -->  00:06:51,520
percent. So we definitely don't want to

340

00:06:51,520  -->  00:06:51,530

341

00:06:51,530  -->  00:06:53,110
include things like this in our analysis

342

00:06:53,110  -->  00:06:53,120

343

00:06:53,120  -->  00:06:55,990
and we need to exclude them from this

344

00:06:55,990  -->  00:06:56,000

345

00:06:56,000  -->  00:06:58,480
report. So how do you do

346

00:06:58,480  -->  00:06:58,490

347

00:06:58,490  -->  00:07:00,520
that? First thing we want to do is want

348

00:07:00,520  -->  00:07:00,530

349

00:07:00,530  -->  00:07:04,780
to go into our formula so idle capacity

350

00:07:04,780  -->  00:07:04,790

351

00:07:04,790  -->  00:07:06,730
moving average and let's click edit over

352

00:07:06,730  -->  00:07:06,740

353

00:07:06,740  -->  00:07:10,330
here. Now we've got this window average

354

00:07:10,330  -->  00:07:10,340

355

00:07:10,340  -->  00:07:13,720
formula here, what we want to do is you

356

00:07:13,720  -->  00:07:13,730

357

00:07:13,730  -->  00:07:15,850
want to add a condition saying that if

358

00:07:15,850  -->  00:07:15,860

359

00:07:15,860  -->  00:07:18,010
there's not enough bars is not enough data

360

00:07:18,010  -->  00:07:18,020

361

00:07:18,020  -->  00:07:21,160
don't calculate the window average. So

362

00:07:21,160  -->  00:07:21,170

363

00:07:21,170  -->  00:07:24,130
how can we add that into our formula? Let

364

00:07:24,130  -->  00:07:24,140

365

00:07:24,140  -->  00:07:25,030
me bring it up again.

366

00:07:25,030  -->  00:07:25,040

367

00:07:25,040  -->  00:07:27,160
So there we go we're going to just add a

368

00:07:27,160  -->  00:07:27,170

369

00:07:27,170  -->  00:07:29,050
simple if condition, so we're going to

370

00:07:29,050  -->  00:07:29,060

371

00:07:29,060  -->  00:07:32,080
add another table calculation so we're

372

00:07:32,080  -->  00:07:32,090

373

00:07:32,090  -->  00:07:34,420
going to go into our table calculations

374

00:07:34,420  -->  00:07:34,430

375

00:07:34,430  -->  00:07:38,530
and we're going to find window which one

376

00:07:38,530  -->  00:07:38,540

377

00:07:38,540  -->  00:07:40,480
do we need? We need window count, this one.

378

00:07:40,480  -->  00:07:40,490

379

00:07:40,490  -->  00:07:42,970
So we're going to say if window count

380

00:07:42,970  -->  00:07:42,980

381

00:07:42,980  -->  00:07:45,370
here you also need an aggregation so why

382

00:07:45,370  -->  00:07:45,380

383

00:07:45,380  -->  00:07:47,200
don't we just use exactly the one that

384

00:07:47,200  -->  00:07:47,210

385

00:07:47,210  -->  00:07:49,120
we are aggregating? So we're going to say

386

00:07:49,120  -->  00:07:49,130

387

00:07:49,130  -->  00:07:51,520
if in our window,

388

00:07:51,520  -->  00:07:51,530

389

00:07:51,530  -->  00:07:53,170
we're going to calculate the number of

390

00:07:53,170  -->  00:07:53,180

391

00:07:53,180  -->  00:07:56,200
of these observations of or of these

392

00:07:56,200  -->  00:07:56,210

393

00:07:56,210  -->  00:07:58,870
values that we've derived in a given

394

00:07:58,870  -->  00:07:58,880

395

00:07:58,880  -->  00:08:01,300
window and that's windows gonna be

396

00:08:01,300  -->  00:08:01,310

397

00:08:01,310  -->  00:08:03,760
exactly the same as we're using here so

398

00:08:03,760  -->  00:08:03,770

399

00:08:03,770  -->  00:08:06,010
we're going to say, in this window seven

400

00:08:06,010  -->  00:08:06,020

401

00:08:06,020  -->  00:08:07,360
bars to the left and then include the

402

00:08:07,360  -->  00:08:07,370

403

00:08:07,370  -->  00:08:11,470
current bar right? If the count of these

404

00:08:11,470  -->  00:08:11,480

405

00:08:11,480  -->  00:08:15,010
values that have been derived is an is

406

00:08:15,010  -->  00:08:15,020

407

00:08:15,020  -->  00:08:18,910
equal to eight so if it is exactly eight

408

00:08:18,910  -->  00:08:18,920

409

00:08:18,920  -->  00:08:22,090
then only we want the calculation right?

410

00:08:22,090  -->  00:08:22,100

411

00:08:22,100  -->  00:08:26,050
So then we'll say then we want this

412

00:08:26,050  -->  00:08:26,060

413

00:08:26,060  -->  00:08:27,820
calculation so I'll just put a capital

414

00:08:27,820  -->  00:08:27,830

415

00:08:27,830  -->  00:08:33,700
if here right so that's the case else if

416

00:08:33,700  -->  00:08:33,710

417

00:08:33,710  -->  00:08:35,860
that's not the case then we want to say

418

00:08:35,860  -->  00:08:35,870

419

00:08:35,870  -->  00:08:38,380
no we don't want any values and then

420

00:08:38,380  -->  00:08:38,390

421

00:08:38,390  -->  00:08:40,210
we'll say and so what is going on here

422

00:08:40,210  -->  00:08:40,220

423

00:08:40,220  -->  00:08:42,520
we're saying calculate the number of

424

00:08:42,520  -->  00:08:42,530

425

00:08:42,530  -->  00:08:45,700
these values in the specified window,

426

00:08:45,700  -->  00:08:45,710

427

00:08:45,710  -->  00:08:47,470
there we go. So that's calculating them

428

00:08:47,470  -->  00:08:47,480

429

00:08:47,480  -->  00:08:49,600
the number of values in the specified

430

00:08:49,600  -->  00:08:49,610

431

00:08:49,610  -->  00:08:52,100
window. I might switch to excel that might

432

00:08:52,100  -->  00:08:52,110

433

00:08:52,110  -->  00:08:54,920
be easier to explain there, so we're

434

00:08:54,920  -->  00:08:54,930

435

00:08:54,930  -->  00:08:57,319
saying let's say for this bar for this

436

00:08:57,319  -->  00:08:57,329

437

00:08:57,329  -->  00:09:00,440
one here calculate the number of values

438

00:09:00,440  -->  00:09:00,450

439

00:09:00,450  -->  00:09:02,060
in this window so in this window there's

440

00:09:02,060  -->  00:09:02,070

441

00:09:02,070  -->  00:09:06,680
eight, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 8 and in that case, if it is

442

00:09:06,680  -->  00:09:06,690

443

00:09:06,690  -->  00:09:10,130
equal to 8 then return the average for

444

00:09:10,130  -->  00:09:10,140

445

00:09:10,140  -->  00:09:14,329
those bars otherwise return 0. You can

446

00:09:14,329  -->  00:09:14,339

447

00:09:14,339  -->  00:09:16,370
basically can replace the herd bars with

448

00:09:16,370  -->  00:09:16,380

449

00:09:16,380  -->  00:09:20,269
rows so in this case calculate the

450

00:09:20,269  -->  00:09:20,279

451

00:09:20,279  -->  00:09:23,990
number of values in these in this window

452

00:09:23,990  -->  00:09:24,000

453

00:09:24,000  -->  00:09:26,569
rows there's eight so return the average.

454

00:09:26,569  -->  00:09:26,579

455

00:09:26,579  -->  00:09:28,610
For this one on the other hand, what will

456

00:09:28,610  -->  00:09:28,620

457

00:09:28,620  -->  00:09:31,699
happen is there's a window so how many

458

00:09:31,699  -->  00:09:31,709

459

00:09:31,709  -->  00:09:33,350
values do we have in this window? We have

460

00:09:33,350  -->  00:09:33,360

461

00:09:33,360  -->  00:09:36,139
no no no no no we only have three values.

462

00:09:36,139  -->  00:09:36,149

463

00:09:36,149  -->  00:09:38,810
So on there's three values three does

464

00:09:38,810  -->  00:09:38,820

465

00:09:38,820  -->  00:09:40,790
not equal eight this condition will be

466

00:09:40,790  -->  00:09:40,800

467

00:09:40,800  -->  00:09:41,870
false

468

00:09:41,870  -->  00:09:41,880

469

00:09:41,880  -->  00:09:43,280
that means that this will not be

470

00:09:43,280  -->  00:09:43,290

471

00:09:43,290  -->  00:09:45,170
executed this will be executed and will

472

00:09:45,170  -->  00:09:45,180

473

00:09:45,180  -->  00:09:47,240
return all, so let's go ahead and click

474

00:09:47,240  -->  00:09:47,250

475

00:09:47,250  -->  00:09:49,370
ok and just watch how what happens to

476

00:09:49,370  -->  00:09:49,380

477

00:09:49,380  -->  00:09:53,480
this bar over here. You can see it got

478

00:09:53,480  -->  00:09:53,490

479

00:09:53,490  -->  00:09:54,230
cut off

480

00:09:54,230  -->  00:09:54,240

481

00:09:54,240  -->  00:09:57,139
so as the red one as the green was on

482

00:09:57,139  -->  00:09:57,149

483

00:09:57,149  -->  00:09:58,579
all everything at the start time is

484

00:09:58,579  -->  00:09:58,589

485

00:09:58,589  -->  00:10:00,769
going to press control zed for you to see

486

00:10:00,769  -->  00:10:00,779

487

00:10:00,779  -->  00:10:02,870
how everything returns and I'm going to

488

00:10:02,870  -->  00:10:02,880

489

00:10:02,880  -->  00:10:04,970
press control Y, to redo the calculation.

490

00:10:04,970  -->  00:10:04,980

491

00:10:04,980  -->  00:10:07,550
So basically we're getting rid of these

492

00:10:07,550  -->  00:10:07,560

493

00:10:07,560  -->  00:10:09,680
average that that are supposed to be

494

00:10:09,680  -->  00:10:09,690

495

00:10:09,690  -->  00:10:11,210
there because we don't have enough data

496

00:10:11,210  -->  00:10:11,220

497

00:10:11,220  -->  00:10:13,550
to calculate them correctly and that is

498

00:10:13,550  -->  00:10:13,560

499

00:10:13,560  -->  00:10:14,540
important,

500

00:10:14,540  -->  00:10:14,550

501

00:10:14,550  -->  00:10:17,389
by doing this as you can see we're right

502

00:10:17,389  -->  00:10:17,399

503

00:10:17,399  -->  00:10:19,639
away saying that this machine is no

504

00:10:19,639  -->  00:10:19,649

505

00:10:19,649  -->  00:10:22,730
longer and longer has an average that is

506

00:10:22,730  -->  00:10:22,740

507

00:10:22,740  -->  00:10:24,439
above the ten percent line and now this

508

00:10:24,439  -->  00:10:24,449

509

00:10:24,449  -->  00:10:26,360
machine also doesn't have an average

510

00:10:26,360  -->  00:10:26,370

511

00:10:26,370  -->  00:10:28,069
about ten percent of line and it's a

512

00:10:28,069  -->  00:10:28,079

513

00:10:28,079  -->  00:10:30,680
completely different. A report that we're

514

00:10:30,680  -->  00:10:30,690

515

00:10:30,690  -->  00:10:32,269
going to create in this case, we were

516

00:10:32,269  -->  00:10:32,279

517

00:10:32,279  -->  00:10:33,829
going to say this machine requires

518

00:10:33,829  -->  00:10:33,839

519

00:10:33,839  -->  00:10:36,079
servicing this machine this machine and

520

00:10:36,079  -->  00:10:36,089

521

00:10:36,089  -->  00:10:39,740
this machine right but if we do the

522

00:10:39,740  -->  00:10:39,750

523

00:10:39,750  -->  00:10:42,319
calculation properly it's only this

524

00:10:42,319  -->  00:10:42,329

525

00:10:42,329  -->  00:10:44,569
machine and this machine that look like

526

00:10:44,569  -->  00:10:44,579

527

00:10:44,579  -->  00:10:46,250
they require servicing and these three

528

00:10:46,250  -->  00:10:46,260

529

00:10:46,260  -->  00:10:49,040
don't. So that is an important step in

530

00:10:49,040  -->  00:10:49,050

531

00:10:49,050  -->  00:10:51,050
quality assurance. First of all,

532

00:10:51,050  -->  00:10:51,060

533

00:10:51,060  -->  00:10:52,910
calculating the moving averages

534

00:10:52,910  -->  00:10:52,920

535

00:10:52,920  -->  00:10:54,500
correctly because if you don't have

536

00:10:54,500  -->  00:10:54,510

537

00:10:54,510  -->  00:10:56,389
sufficient data you have to tell

538

00:10:56,389  -->  00:10:56,399

539

00:10:56,399  -->  00:10:58,250
Tableau not to calculate the moving

540

00:10:58,250  -->  00:10:58,260

541

00:10:58,260  -->  00:11:00,350
average on the certain bars or certain

542

00:11:00,350  -->  00:11:00,360

543

00:11:00,360  -->  00:11:01,410
rows

544

00:11:01,410  -->  00:11:01,420

545

00:11:01,420  -->  00:11:04,740
and finally also another quality assurance

546

00:11:04,740  -->  00:11:04,750

547

00:11:04,750  -->  00:11:06,480
check that since we've already got this

548

00:11:06,480  -->  00:11:06,490

549

00:11:06,490  -->  00:11:08,970
up and running what we can do is we can

550

00:11:08,970  -->  00:11:08,980

551

00:11:08,980  -->  00:11:12,300
take a random bar or a random row let's

552

00:11:12,300  -->  00:11:12,310

553

00:11:12,310  -->  00:11:15,480
say let's say 10th of September at

554

00:11:15,480  -->  00:11:15,490

555

00:11:15,490  -->  00:11:18,210
midnight and we can look at the average

556

00:11:18,210  -->  00:11:18,220

557

00:11:18,220  -->  00:11:21,360
here so 0.0342  and let's have a look

558

00:11:21,360  -->  00:11:21,370

559

00:11:21,370  -->  00:11:24,420
at what happened here at one-tenth of

560

00:11:24,420  -->  00:11:24,430

561

00:11:24,430  -->  00:11:27,210
September at midnight and we just want

562

00:11:27,210  -->  00:11:27,220

563

00:11:27,220  -->  00:11:29,070
to compare and make sure that the value

564

00:11:29,070  -->  00:11:29,080

565

00:11:29,080  -->  00:11:31,260
we see in Excel that the one that we

566

00:11:31,260  -->  00:11:31,270

567

00:11:31,270  -->  00:11:34,140
just calculated is exactly the same as

568

00:11:34,140  -->  00:11:34,150

569

00:11:34,150  -->  00:11:37,050
what we will see here. So there we go,

570

00:11:37,050  -->  00:11:37,060

571

00:11:37,060  -->  00:11:43,830
0.0034  what did we see in Excel 0.0034

572

00:11:43,830  -->  00:11:43,840

573

00:11:43,840  -->  00:11:46,290
so that means that our calculation

574

00:11:46,290  -->  00:11:46,300

575

00:11:46,300  -->  00:11:47,820
is correct and that's a good way of

576

00:11:47,820  -->  00:11:47,830

577

00:11:47,830  -->  00:11:50,460
conducting a quality assurance check on

578

00:11:50,460  -->  00:11:50,470

579

00:11:50,470  -->  00:11:52,680
your table calculations simply by going

580

00:11:52,680  -->  00:11:52,690

581

00:11:52,690  -->  00:11:56,400
back into excel and re-creating those

582

00:11:56,400  -->  00:11:56,410

583

00:11:56,410  -->  00:12:00,390
table calculations from scratch. It does

584

00:12:00,390  -->  00:12:00,400

585

00:12:00,400  -->  00:12:02,010
take time it is a bit of a tedious task

586

00:12:02,010  -->  00:12:02,020

587

00:12:02,020  -->  00:12:04,590
but you only have to do it for one of

588

00:12:04,590  -->  00:12:04,600

589

00:12:04,600  -->  00:12:06,690
your elements of your data so you

590

00:12:06,690  -->  00:12:06,700

591

00:12:06,700  -->  00:12:08,010
don't have to do it for all of your

592

00:12:08,010  -->  00:12:08,020

593

00:12:08,020  -->  00:12:10,890
machines just do it for one because it

594

00:12:10,890  -->  00:12:10,900

595

00:12:10,900  -->  00:12:12,570
works for this machine will work for the

596

00:12:12,570  -->  00:12:12,580

597

00:12:12,580  -->  00:12:15,330
rest of them but it will also save you

598

00:12:15,330  -->  00:12:15,340

599

00:12:15,340  -->  00:12:18,210
from errors and table calculations can

600

00:12:18,210  -->  00:12:18,220

601

00:12:18,220  -->  00:12:20,400
be complex especially when you're piling

602

00:12:20,400  -->  00:12:20,410

603

00:12:20,410  -->  00:12:21,780
many on top of each other like we're

604

00:12:21,780  -->  00:12:21,790

605

00:12:21,790  -->  00:12:23,460
doing now we already have two layers of

606

00:12:23,460  -->  00:12:23,470

607

00:12:23,470  -->  00:12:24,810
table calculations,

608

00:12:24,810  -->  00:12:24,820

609

00:12:24,820  -->  00:12:27,150
plus we've just added a condition so you

610

00:12:27,150  -->  00:12:27,160

611

00:12:27,160  -->  00:12:29,070
want to make sure that your table

612

00:12:29,070  -->  00:12:29,080

613

00:12:29,080  -->  00:12:30,870
calculations are correct. It's better to

614

00:12:30,870  -->  00:12:30,880

615

00:12:30,880  -->  00:12:34,020
spend a bit more time but get everything

616

00:12:34,020  -->  00:12:34,030

617

00:12:34,030  -->  00:12:36,360
right so that you report the correct

618

00:12:36,360  -->  00:12:36,370

619

00:12:36,370  -->  00:12:37,290
thing.

620

00:12:37,290  -->  00:12:37,300

621

00:12:37,300  -->  00:12:39,360
Ok so that's how you conduct quality

622

00:12:39,360  -->  00:12:39,370

623

00:12:39,370  -->  00:12:41,400
assurance for your table calculations

624

00:12:41,400  -->  00:12:41,410

625

00:12:41,410  -->  00:12:43,530
and that is how we fixed up all moving

626

00:12:43,530  -->  00:12:43,540

627

00:12:43,540  -->  00:12:45,900
average and this brings us to the end of

628

00:12:45,900  -->  00:12:45,910

629

00:12:45,910  -->  00:12:49,080
today's tutorial. Next time we're going

630

00:12:49,080  -->  00:12:49,090

631

00:12:49,090  -->  00:12:51,300
to start deriving insight from a

632

00:12:51,300  -->  00:12:51,310

633

00:12:51,310  -->  00:12:54,030
data. We're getting very close to punching

634

00:12:54,030  -->  00:12:54,040

635

00:12:54,040  -->  00:12:57,480
this report out and deriving this these

636

00:12:57,480  -->  00:12:57,490

637

00:12:57,490  -->  00:12:59,370
insights to the client, I look forward

638

00:12:59,370  -->  00:12:59,380

639

00:12:59,380  -->  00:13:00,330
to seeing you next time.

640

00:13:00,330  -->  00:13:00,340

641

00:13:00,340  -->  00:13:06,900
Until then, happy analyzing.
