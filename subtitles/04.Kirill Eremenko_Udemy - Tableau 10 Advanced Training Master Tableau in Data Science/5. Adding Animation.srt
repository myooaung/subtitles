00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,559
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06,559  -->  00:00:06,569

3

00:00:06,569  -->  00:00:08,480
course on Tableau. In the previous

4

00:00:08,480  -->  00:00:08,490

5

00:00:08,490  -->  00:00:10,520
tutorial we built this beautiful-looking

6

00:00:10,520  -->  00:00:10,530

7

00:00:10,530  -->  00:00:13,610
visualization for country demographic

8

00:00:13,610  -->  00:00:13,620

9

00:00:13,620  -->  00:00:15,770
data and today we're finally going

10

00:00:15,770  -->  00:00:15,780

11

00:00:15,780  -->  00:00:18,740
to add the animation to see all of this

12

00:00:18,740  -->  00:00:18,750

13

00:00:18,750  -->  00:00:20,929
progress in action over the past 50-plus

14

00:00:20,929  -->  00:00:20,939

15

00:00:20,939  -->  00:00:23,660
years. So adding animations in Tableau

16

00:00:23,660  -->  00:00:23,670

17

00:00:23,670  -->  00:00:25,849
is actually very very simple. To start

18

00:00:25,849  -->  00:00:25,859

19

00:00:25,859  -->  00:00:27,830
off, we're going to remove year from

20

00:00:27,830  -->  00:00:27,840

21

00:00:27,840  -->  00:00:29,870
filter because we are going to build our

22

00:00:29,870  -->  00:00:29,880

23

00:00:29,880  -->  00:00:32,179
visualization or our animation based on

24

00:00:32,179  -->  00:00:32,189

25

00:00:32,189  -->  00:00:33,950
different year, so let's get it out of

26

00:00:33,950  -->  00:00:33,960

27

00:00:33,960  -->  00:00:36,200
filter and now we're just going to take

28

00:00:36,200  -->  00:00:36,210

29

00:00:36,210  -->  00:00:38,389
a year and we're going to drag it into

30

00:00:38,389  -->  00:00:38,399

31

00:00:38,399  -->  00:00:40,760
this tab which we haven't used before

32

00:00:40,760  -->  00:00:40,770

33

00:00:40,770  -->  00:00:43,280
which is called pages and once you drag

34

00:00:43,280  -->  00:00:43,290

35

00:00:43,290  -->  00:00:47,029
it into there, that pretty much builds

36

00:00:47,029  -->  00:00:47,039

37

00:00:47,039  -->  00:00:49,610
your animation right there. So you can

38

00:00:49,610  -->  00:00:49,620

39

00:00:49,620  -->  00:00:52,160
see a time line up here's and this is

40

00:00:52,160  -->  00:00:52,170

41

00:00:52,170  -->  00:00:54,410
actually a series of pages so for us

42

00:00:54,410  -->  00:00:54,420

43

00:00:54,420  -->  00:00:56,240
it's a timeline because we are using

44

00:00:56,240  -->  00:00:56,250

45

00:00:56,250  -->  00:00:58,549
year and bear in mind that the in this

46

00:00:58,549  -->  00:00:58,559

47

00:00:58,559  -->  00:01:01,130
case in our case year is recognized as a

48

00:01:01,130  -->  00:01:01,140

49

00:01:01,140  -->  00:01:04,729
string. It's not a date and you can tell

50

00:01:04,729  -->  00:01:04,739

51

00:01:04,739  -->  00:01:06,200
by this indicate over here which says

52

00:01:06,200  -->  00:01:06,210

53

00:01:06,210  -->  00:01:09,440
ABC and yet we're still able to create

54

00:01:09,440  -->  00:01:09,450

55

00:01:09,450  -->  00:01:11,780
this animation because Tableau does

56

00:01:11,780  -->  00:01:11,790

57

00:01:11,790  -->  00:01:13,789
require pages and pages can be

58

00:01:13,789  -->  00:01:13,799

59

00:01:13,799  -->  00:01:15,140
practically anything.

60

00:01:15,140  -->  00:01:15,150

61

00:01:15,150  -->  00:01:17,960
Well in our case, we are using years and

62

00:01:17,960  -->  00:01:17,970

63

00:01:17,970  -->  00:01:19,820
here you can control the animation you

64

00:01:19,820  -->  00:01:19,830

65

00:01:19,830  -->  00:01:22,010
can move zoom through the different

66

00:01:22,010  -->  00:01:22,020

67

00:01:22,020  -->  00:01:23,359
years and you can see how it's changing

68

00:01:23,359  -->  00:01:23,369

69

00:01:23,369  -->  00:01:25,219
as I click to the right or I can go back

70

00:01:25,219  -->  00:01:25,229

71

00:01:25,229  -->  00:01:28,609
to the left and that's changing

72

00:01:28,609  -->  00:01:28,619

73

00:01:28,619  -->  00:01:31,670
animation and also you can just let it

74

00:01:31,670  -->  00:01:31,680

75

00:01:31,680  -->  00:01:33,200
play by itself so I can just click play

76

00:01:33,200  -->  00:01:33,210

77

00:01:33,210  -->  00:01:36,080
and it will be changing slowly one step

78

00:01:36,080  -->  00:01:36,090

79

00:01:36,090  -->  00:01:38,270
at a time. You can control the speed you

80

00:01:38,270  -->  00:01:38,280

81

00:01:38,280  -->  00:01:40,880
can make it a change slower so here you

82

00:01:40,880  -->  00:01:40,890

83

00:01:40,890  -->  00:01:43,399
can see that it's changing very slowly

84

00:01:43,399  -->  00:01:43,409

85

00:01:43,409  -->  00:01:44,719
and that's if you want to analyze the

86

00:01:44,719  -->  00:01:44,729

87

00:01:44,729  -->  00:01:47,359
data in a lot of detail and finally

88

00:01:47,359  -->  00:01:47,369

89

00:01:47,369  -->  00:01:49,039
you can put on the maximum speed and

90

00:01:49,039  -->  00:01:49,049

91

00:01:49,049  -->  00:01:51,440
it's changing very quickly. So there you

92

00:01:51,440  -->  00:01:51,450

93

00:01:51,450  -->  00:01:53,780
go you can see how the animation works

94

00:01:53,780  -->  00:01:53,790

95

00:01:53,790  -->  00:01:57,410
very impressive isn't it? So that's how

96

00:01:57,410  -->  00:01:57,420

97

00:01:57,420  -->  00:01:58,999
the countries are changing and you can

98

00:01:58,999  -->  00:01:59,009

99

00:01:59,009  -->  00:02:00,889
look at individual countries for

100

00:02:00,889  -->  00:02:00,899

101

00:02:00,899  -->  00:02:03,319
instance this big red circle is China

102

00:02:03,319  -->  00:02:03,329

103

00:02:03,329  -->  00:02:05,990
and you can see it started over here

104

00:02:05,990  -->  00:02:06,000

105

00:02:06,000  -->  00:02:10,550
with fertility rate of 5.75 and

106

00:02:10,550  -->  00:02:10,560

107

00:02:10,560  -->  00:02:13,200
life expectancy of 43 years only

108

00:02:13,200  -->  00:02:13,210

109

00:02:13,210  -->  00:02:16,950
back in 1960 and and you can

110

00:02:16,950  -->  00:02:16,960

111

00:02:16,960  -->  00:02:20,640
see how it's moving through this grid

112

00:02:20,640  -->  00:02:20,650

113

00:02:20,650  -->  00:02:24,810
and finally it gets to 2013 where life

114

00:02:24,810  -->  00:02:24,820

115

00:02:24,820  -->  00:02:27,960
expectancy for fertility rate is 1.6 so

116

00:02:27,960  -->  00:02:27,970

117

00:02:27,970  -->  00:02:33,630
1.6 children per family and 75 years of

118

00:02:33,630  -->  00:02:33,640

119

00:02:33,640  -->  00:02:36,030
life expectancy, great improvement in

120

00:02:36,030  -->  00:02:36,040

121

00:02:36,040  -->  00:02:38,520
terms of life expectancy and this is

122

00:02:38,520  -->  00:02:38,530

123

00:02:38,530  -->  00:02:41,310
exactly what we were after. We wanted to

124

00:02:41,310  -->  00:02:41,320

125

00:02:41,320  -->  00:02:44,250
see how this what the tendencies or

126

00:02:44,250  -->  00:02:44,260

127

00:02:44,260  -->  00:02:46,080
trends are in the world in terms of

128

00:02:46,080  -->  00:02:46,090

129

00:02:46,090  -->  00:02:50,100
fertility and life expectancy. So the

130

00:02:50,100  -->  00:02:50,110

131

00:02:50,110  -->  00:02:51,870
other thing we can also see here is of

132

00:02:51,870  -->  00:02:51,880

133

00:02:51,880  -->  00:02:53,250
course population, you can see how the

134

00:02:53,250  -->  00:02:53,260

135

00:02:53,260  -->  00:02:55,200
bubble is growing for instance let's

136

00:02:55,200  -->  00:02:55,210

137

00:02:55,210  -->  00:02:57,570
look at the bubble China, you can see how

138

00:02:57,570  -->  00:02:57,580

139

00:02:57,580  -->  00:03:01,050
it's growing with time so it got much

140

00:03:01,050  -->  00:03:01,060

141

00:03:01,060  -->  00:03:03,720
bigger towards the end and that is

142

00:03:03,720  -->  00:03:03,730

143

00:03:03,730  -->  00:03:06,810
talking to the population of the country

144

00:03:06,810  -->  00:03:06,820

145

00:03:06,820  -->  00:03:09,960
and finally the other dimension that we

146

00:03:09,960  -->  00:03:09,970

147

00:03:09,970  -->  00:03:12,840
have here is the color which is telling

148

00:03:12,840  -->  00:03:12,850

149

00:03:12,850  -->  00:03:15,870
us which region these countries are from

150

00:03:15,870  -->  00:03:15,880

151

00:03:15,880  -->  00:03:19,170
and we've got Asia, we've got Europe, Latin

152

00:03:19,170  -->  00:03:19,180

153

00:03:19,180  -->  00:03:22,710
America, America, South Southern Africa,

154

00:03:22,710  -->  00:03:22,720

155

00:03:22,720  -->  00:03:26,610
Northern Africa and and so on, and in a

156

00:03:26,610  -->  00:03:26,620

157

00:03:26,620  -->  00:03:28,440
way what you have here on this

158

00:03:28,440  -->  00:03:28,450

159

00:03:28,450  -->  00:03:30,660
two-dimensional picture this is very

160

00:03:30,660  -->  00:03:30,670

161

00:03:30,670  -->  00:03:32,610
exciting actually on this

162

00:03:32,610  -->  00:03:32,620

163

00:03:32,620  -->  00:03:35,370
two-dimensional picture what you have is

164

00:03:35,370  -->  00:03:35,380

165

00:03:35,380  -->  00:03:38,850
five dimensions of information. You have

166

00:03:38,850  -->  00:03:38,860

167

00:03:38,860  -->  00:03:41,400
fertility rate, life expectancy right?

168

00:03:41,400  -->  00:03:41,410

169

00:03:41,410  -->  00:03:43,560
Then you have population which is the

170

00:03:43,560  -->  00:03:43,570

171

00:03:43,570  -->  00:03:46,170
size that's three, then you actually have

172

00:03:46,170  -->  00:03:46,180

173

00:03:46,180  -->  00:03:47,940
a fourth dimension which is the color

174

00:03:47,940  -->  00:03:47,950

175

00:03:47,950  -->  00:03:49,560
and that is which region they're coming

176

00:03:49,560  -->  00:03:49,570

177

00:03:49,570  -->  00:03:52,320
from and finally animation allows you to

178

00:03:52,320  -->  00:03:52,330

179

00:03:52,330  -->  00:03:54,960
add a fifth dimension to your visual and

180

00:03:54,960  -->  00:03:54,970

181

00:03:54,970  -->  00:03:58,020
that is the year so as you're

182

00:03:58,020  -->  00:03:58,030

183

00:03:58,030  -->  00:04:01,020
progressing through years you're you're

184

00:04:01,020  -->  00:04:01,030

185

00:04:01,030  -->  00:04:04,290
seeing the fifth dimension which is time

186

00:04:04,290  -->  00:04:04,300

187

00:04:04,300  -->  00:04:07,290
and that is pretty cool. So now we're

188

00:04:07,290  -->  00:04:07,300

189

00:04:07,300  -->  00:04:09,000
going to fix up just a couple more

190

00:04:09,000  -->  00:04:09,010

191

00:04:09,010  -->  00:04:11,910
things that we're going to fix up the

192

00:04:11,910  -->  00:04:11,920

193

00:04:11,920  -->  00:04:15,780
axis here so we're going to fix it at

194

00:04:15,780  -->  00:04:15,790

195

00:04:15,790  -->  00:04:19,410
eight and make it start at one and this

196

00:04:19,410  -->  00:04:19,420

197

00:04:19,420  -->  00:04:23,370
axis we're going to fix it at let's say

198

00:04:23,370  -->  00:04:23,380

199

00:04:23,380  -->  00:04:26,640
85 and we'll make a start 30.

200

00:04:26,640  -->  00:04:26,650

201

00:04:26,650  -->  00:04:30,659
And now if we move everything to left, it

202

00:04:30,659  -->  00:04:30,669

203

00:04:30,669  -->  00:04:32,159
kind of fits in a bit better so let's

204

00:04:32,159  -->  00:04:32,169

205

00:04:32,169  -->  00:04:33,360
play that again.

206

00:04:33,360  -->  00:04:33,370

207

00:04:33,370  -->  00:04:39,990
There you go pretty cool isn't it?

208

00:04:39,990  -->  00:04:40,000

209

00:04:40,000  -->  00:04:42,570
So as we discussed the nulls are

210

00:04:42,570  -->  00:04:42,580

211

00:04:42,580  -->  00:04:45,120
attributed to the fact that some

212

00:04:45,120  -->  00:04:45,130

213

00:04:45,130  -->  00:04:46,620
countries don't have data for some years

214

00:04:46,620  -->  00:04:46,630

215

00:04:46,630  -->  00:04:48,719
and you can check that in your actual

216

00:04:48,719  -->  00:04:48,729

217

00:04:48,729  -->  00:04:50,189
data sources so we're just going to

218

00:04:50,189  -->  00:04:50,199

219

00:04:50,199  -->  00:04:51,930
right-click and hide indicated so it's

220

00:04:51,930  -->  00:04:51,940

221

00:04:51,940  -->  00:04:55,409
not ruining our visual and let's play it

222

00:04:55,409  -->  00:04:55,419

223

00:04:55,419  -->  00:04:56,760
one more time. I'll show you another

224

00:04:56,760  -->  00:04:56,770

225

00:04:56,770  -->  00:05:00,300
quick trick here so we can say loop

226

00:05:00,300  -->  00:05:00,310

227

00:05:00,310  -->  00:05:03,810
playback and that way it will continue

228

00:05:03,810  -->  00:05:03,820

229

00:05:03,820  -->  00:05:05,580
playing out once it's finished it will

230

00:05:05,580  -->  00:05:05,590

231

00:05:05,590  -->  00:05:07,080
continue playing you don't really need

232

00:05:07,080  -->  00:05:07,090

233

00:05:07,090  -->  00:05:08,820
that in this visual but you might need

234

00:05:08,820  -->  00:05:08,830

235

00:05:08,830  -->  00:05:11,400
it in other visuals and just that's one

236

00:05:11,400  -->  00:05:11,410

237

00:05:11,410  -->  00:05:14,340
additional control that you can apply

238

00:05:14,340  -->  00:05:14,350

239

00:05:14,350  -->  00:05:16,529
here, so I'm just going to switch that

240

00:05:16,529  -->  00:05:16,539

241

00:05:16,539  -->  00:05:18,990
off and one more trick that I'll show

242

00:05:18,990  -->  00:05:19,000

243

00:05:19,000  -->  00:05:21,450
you here is you can play it backwards so

244

00:05:21,450  -->  00:05:21,460

245

00:05:21,460  -->  00:05:23,460
once it gets the end if you like you can

246

00:05:23,460  -->  00:05:23,470

247

00:05:23,470  -->  00:05:25,560
play it backwards and you'll see the

248

00:05:25,560  -->  00:05:25,570

249

00:05:25,570  -->  00:05:28,620
trends all going the opposite way and

250

00:05:28,620  -->  00:05:28,630

251

00:05:28,630  -->  00:05:31,230
one more thing that we might want to add

252

00:05:31,230  -->  00:05:31,240

253

00:05:31,240  -->  00:05:33,510
to this visualization is indication of

254

00:05:33,510  -->  00:05:33,520

255

00:05:33,520  -->  00:05:35,939
what year it is because people be looking

256

00:05:35,939  -->  00:05:35,949

257

00:05:35,949  -->  00:05:38,010
here not here and they might want to see

258

00:05:38,010  -->  00:05:38,020

259

00:05:38,020  -->  00:05:40,529
what year the visualizations currently

260

00:05:40,529  -->  00:05:40,539

261

00:05:40,539  -->  00:05:42,510
going through, so what we're going to do is

262

00:05:42,510  -->  00:05:42,520

263

00:05:42,520  -->  00:05:44,909
we're going to right-click and we'll

264

00:05:44,909  -->  00:05:44,919

265

00:05:44,919  -->  00:05:47,879
select annotate and will click area and

266

00:05:47,879  -->  00:05:47,889

267

00:05:47,889  -->  00:05:51,629
here we will say insert and here we will

268

00:05:51,629  -->  00:05:51,639

269

00:05:51,639  -->  00:05:55,800
say page name. So this is the name of our

270

00:05:55,800  -->  00:05:55,810

271

00:05:55,810  -->  00:05:57,600
page and we're going to insert here and

272

00:05:57,600  -->  00:05:57,610

273

00:05:57,610  -->  00:06:00,089
maybe make it quite large making a 72

274

00:06:00,089  -->  00:06:00,099

275

00:06:00,099  -->  00:06:02,670
and we don't want it black once again, we

276

00:06:02,670  -->  00:06:02,680

277

00:06:02,680  -->  00:06:08,610
want this color and make it bigger put

278

00:06:08,610  -->  00:06:08,620

279

00:06:08,620  -->  00:06:12,960
it in the top someone like that and we

280

00:06:12,960  -->  00:06:12,970

281

00:06:12,970  -->  00:06:14,790
want to get rid of this border. We don't

282

00:06:14,790  -->  00:06:14,800

283

00:06:14,800  -->  00:06:15,990
want the border so we're going to right

284

00:06:15,990  -->  00:06:16,000

285

00:06:16,000  -->  00:06:17,730
click format,

286

00:06:17,730  -->  00:06:17,740

287

00:06:17,740  -->  00:06:20,939
none there we go so let's see how this

288

00:06:20,939  -->  00:06:20,949

289

00:06:20,949  -->  00:06:22,560
changes maybe this is a big big let's

290

00:06:22,560  -->  00:06:22,570

291

00:06:22,570  -->  00:06:26,339
make it the next size down 48. That's too

292

00:06:26,339  -->  00:06:26,349

293

00:06:26,349  -->  00:06:31,320
small, so let's make this 64.

294

00:06:31,320  -->  00:06:31,330

295

00:06:31,330  -->  00:06:34,980
There we go, now let's see how this

296

00:06:34,980  -->  00:06:34,990

297

00:06:34,990  -->  00:06:38,610
changes as we play our visualization

298

00:06:38,610  -->  00:06:38,620

299

00:06:38,620  -->  00:06:40,890
that button there you go so you can see

300

00:06:40,890  -->  00:06:40,900

301

00:06:40,900  -->  00:06:44,610
that the year is changing and if you

302

00:06:44,610  -->  00:06:44,620

303

00:06:44,620  -->  00:06:46,620
want to analyze it in a bit of a more

304

00:06:46,620  -->  00:06:46,630

305

00:06:46,630  -->  00:06:49,290
slower version then you can actually see

306

00:06:49,290  -->  00:06:49,300

307

00:06:49,300  -->  00:06:52,080
every single year and other people see

308

00:06:52,080  -->  00:06:52,090

309

00:06:52,090  -->  00:06:54,000
the year and then they can see how the

310

00:06:54,000  -->  00:06:54,010

311

00:06:54,010  -->  00:06:55,590
countries are changing so they can

312

00:06:55,590  -->  00:06:55,600

313

00:06:55,600  -->  00:06:57,870
reference that here if they ever need to.

314

00:06:57,870  -->  00:06:57,880

315

00:06:57,880  -->  00:06:59,490
So that is how you create basic

316

00:06:59,490  -->  00:06:59,500

317

00:06:59,500  -->  00:07:01,200
animation in Tableau, that's that's the

318

00:07:01,200  -->  00:07:01,210

319

00:07:01,210  -->  00:07:03,510
first starting point for us. In one of

320

00:07:03,510  -->  00:07:03,520

321

00:07:03,520  -->  00:07:04,740
the next tutorials in this section I

322

00:07:04,740  -->  00:07:04,750

323

00:07:04,750  -->  00:07:06,510
will show you how to add advanced

324

00:07:06,510  -->  00:07:06,520

325

00:07:06,520  -->  00:07:08,969
features to this visualization to make

326

00:07:08,969  -->  00:07:08,979

327

00:07:08,979  -->  00:07:13,140
its interpretation more useful and more

328

00:07:13,140  -->  00:07:13,150

329

00:07:13,150  -->  00:07:15,390
intuitive for the people that are going

330

00:07:15,390  -->  00:07:15,400

331

00:07:15,400  -->  00:07:17,040
to be looking at it so that they can

332

00:07:17,040  -->  00:07:17,050

333

00:07:17,050  -->  00:07:20,219
extract more insights from it, and there

334

00:07:20,219  -->  00:07:20,229

335

00:07:20,229  -->  00:07:21,689
we go that's all for today. I look

336
