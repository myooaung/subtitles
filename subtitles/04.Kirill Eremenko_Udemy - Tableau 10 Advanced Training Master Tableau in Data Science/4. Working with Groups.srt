1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:05,000

2

00:00:05,000  -->  00:00:06,839
Welcome back to the advanced course on

3

00:00:06,839  -->  00:00:08,540
Tableau. In the previous tutorial we

4

00:00:08,540  -->  00:00:08,550

5

00:00:08,550  -->  00:00:10,040
loaded up our data, created some

6

00:00:10,040  -->  00:00:10,050

7

00:00:10,050  -->  00:00:12,620
folders, organized our workspace and

8

00:00:12,620  -->  00:00:12,630

9

00:00:12,630  -->  00:00:15,020
today we're finally starting today we're

10

00:00:15,020  -->  00:00:15,030

11

00:00:15,030  -->  00:00:17,480
talking about groups. Now groups are a

12

00:00:17,480  -->  00:00:17,490

13

00:00:17,490  -->  00:00:19,550
feature in Tableau. I wanted to say

14

00:00:19,550  -->  00:00:19,560

15

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:21,349
powerful feature but the thing is that

16

00:00:21,349  -->  00:00:21,359

17

00:00:21,359  -->  00:00:23,599
in this course and even in this section

18

00:00:23,599  -->  00:00:23,609

19

00:00:23,609  -->  00:00:25,490
we're going to learn much more powerful

20

00:00:25,490  -->  00:00:25,500

21

00:00:25,500  -->  00:00:27,890
tools that we have at our disposal so

22

00:00:27,890  -->  00:00:27,900

23

00:00:27,900  -->  00:00:29,779
let's just go ahead and call groups a

24

00:00:29,779  -->  00:00:29,789

25

00:00:29,789  -->  00:00:31,700
feature because as you'll see they're

26

00:00:31,700  -->  00:00:31,710

27

00:00:31,710  -->  00:00:32,810
very easy

28

00:00:32,810  -->  00:00:32,820

29

00:00:32,820  -->  00:00:34,220
they're pretty straightforward and

30

00:00:34,220  -->  00:00:34,230

31

00:00:34,230  -->  00:00:36,709
they're essential to know and sometimes

32

00:00:36,709  -->  00:00:36,719

33

00:00:36,719  -->  00:00:39,410
use and we will learn all about them in

34

00:00:39,410  -->  00:00:39,420

35

00:00:39,420  -->  00:00:41,030
today's tutorial. So let's go ahead and

36

00:00:41,030  -->  00:00:41,040

37

00:00:41,040  -->  00:00:44,119
get started and right away we've got a

38

00:00:44,119  -->  00:00:44,129

39

00:00:44,129  -->  00:00:48,080
very unique situation. Here, what we can

40

00:00:48,080  -->  00:00:48,090

41

00:00:48,090  -->  00:00:50,810
see is in our dimensions and this might

42

00:00:50,810  -->  00:00:50,820

43

00:00:50,820  -->  00:00:52,340
not be the case for you if you're doing

44

00:00:52,340  -->  00:00:52,350

45

00:00:52,350  -->  00:00:54,470
this tutorial bit later despite might be

46

00:00:54,470  -->  00:00:54,480

47

00:00:54,480  -->  00:00:57,020
different but just observe in that case

48

00:00:57,020  -->  00:00:57,030

49

00:00:57,030  -->  00:01:00,110
what I have in my Tableau right now if

50

00:01:00,110  -->  00:01:00,120

51

00:01:00,120  -->  00:01:01,220
you go through dimensions you can see

52

00:01:01,220  -->  00:01:01,230

53

00:01:01,230  -->  00:01:03,110
they're all blue except for year founded,

54

00:01:03,110  -->  00:01:03,120

55

00:01:03,120  -->  00:01:04,880
it some, for some reason it is highlighted in

56

00:01:04,880  -->  00:01:04,890

57

00:01:04,890  -->  00:01:07,219
green and as you recall from our

58

00:01:07,219  -->  00:01:07,229

59

00:01:07,229  -->  00:01:09,830
standard course in Tableau dimensions

60

00:01:09,830  -->  00:01:09,840

61

00:01:09,840  -->  00:01:11,480
should be blue and measures should be

62

00:01:11,480  -->  00:01:11,490

63

00:01:11,490  -->  00:01:13,219
green so you can see that measures are

64

00:01:13,219  -->  00:01:13,229

65

00:01:13,229  -->  00:01:15,350
in green here and what this looks like

66

00:01:15,350  -->  00:01:15,360

67

00:01:15,360  -->  00:01:21,260
is a type conversion error by Tableau,

68

00:01:21,260  -->  00:01:21,270

69

00:01:21,270  -->  00:01:23,870
type analysis error by Tableau and

70

00:01:23,870  -->  00:01:23,880

71

00:01:23,880  -->  00:01:27,170
obviously if it's something in here it

72

00:01:27,170  -->  00:01:27,180

73

00:01:27,180  -->  00:01:28,819
should be a dimension so that should be

74

00:01:28,819  -->  00:01:28,829

75

00:01:28,829  -->  00:01:30,410
in blue or it should actually be in

76

00:01:30,410  -->  00:01:30,420

77

00:01:30,420  -->  00:01:32,719
measures and if you drag it onto the

78

00:01:32,719  -->  00:01:32,729

79

00:01:32,729  -->  00:01:33,890
chart, you'll see that it's actually in

80

00:01:33,890  -->  00:01:33,900

81

00:01:33,900  -->  00:01:38,810
green and it is being seen as a measure.

82

00:01:38,810  -->  00:01:38,820

83

00:01:38,820  -->  00:01:41,030
So let's go ahead and fix that, we'll just

84

00:01:41,030  -->  00:01:41,040

85

00:01:41,040  -->  00:01:42,560
take your fun and drag it into

86

00:01:42,560  -->  00:01:42,570

87

00:01:42,570  -->  00:01:45,710
measures and now it's in here but we

88

00:01:45,710  -->  00:01:45,720

89

00:01:45,720  -->  00:01:47,510
actually wanted to be a dimension

90

00:01:47,510  -->  00:01:47,520

91

00:01:47,520  -->  00:01:50,840
because these are the years so when the

92

00:01:50,840  -->  00:01:50,850

93

00:01:50,850  -->  00:01:51,980
companies were found we're not going to be

94

00:01:51,980  -->  00:01:51,990

95

00:01:51,990  -->  00:01:53,569
adding them up or anything. This is more like

96

00:01:53,569  -->  00:01:53,579

97

00:01:53,579  -->  00:01:55,730
a categorical variable for us so we now

98

00:01:55,730  -->  00:01:55,740

99

00:01:55,740  -->  00:01:57,170
we're just gonna drag it back and now

100

00:01:57,170  -->  00:01:57,180

101

00:01:57,180  -->  00:01:59,240
you can see that it's in blue. So there

102

00:01:59,240  -->  00:01:59,250

103

00:01:59,250  -->  00:02:01,249
you go that was a very unique situation

104

00:02:01,249  -->  00:02:01,259

105

00:02:01,259  -->  00:02:03,410
that's like I guess seeing a white

106

00:02:03,410  -->  00:02:03,420

107

00:02:03,420  -->  00:02:04,429
rhinoceros.

108

00:02:04,500  -->  00:02:06,679
Alright let's take a year founded and

109

00:02:06,679  -->  00:02:06,689

110

00:02:06,689  -->  00:02:09,830
drag it into columns, now what we're

111

00:02:09,830  -->  00:02:09,840

112

00:02:09,840  -->  00:02:12,380
going to do is we're going to, we want to

113

00:02:12,380  -->  00:02:12,390

114

00:02:12,390  -->  00:02:13,790
find out how many companies

115

00:02:13,790  -->  00:02:13,800

116

00:02:13,800  -->  00:02:15,200
were founded in each of these

117

00:02:15,200  -->  00:02:15,210

118

00:02:15,210  -->  00:02:18,560
years. So let's go and look for number of

119

00:02:18,560  -->  00:02:18,570

120

00:02:18,570  -->  00:02:21,770
records and drag it into rows and right

121

00:02:21,770  -->  00:02:21,780

122

00:02:21,780  -->  00:02:23,510
away we get a bar chart. That's exactly

123

00:02:23,510  -->  00:02:23,520

124

00:02:23,520  -->  00:02:26,240
what we wanted to see, so as you can see

125

00:02:26,240  -->  00:02:26,250

126

00:02:26,250  -->  00:02:28,760
that the venture capital fund is

127

00:02:28,760  -->  00:02:28,770

128

00:02:28,770  -->  00:02:31,250
analyzing a thousand companies most of

129

00:02:31,250  -->  00:02:31,260

130

00:02:31,260  -->  00:02:31,760
which were founded in 2009 and

131

00:02:31,760  -->  00:02:32,260

132

00:02:32,260  -->  00:02:37,970
onwards and it's still a few were

133

00:02:37,970  -->  00:02:37,980

134

00:02:37,980  -->  00:02:40,400
founded in other previous years.

135

00:02:40,400  -->  00:02:40,410

136

00:02:40,410  -->  00:02:43,400
So now what you might want to do is say

137

00:02:43,400  -->  00:02:43,410

138

00:02:43,410  -->  00:02:46,130
that you want to analyze all of these

139

00:02:46,130  -->  00:02:46,140

140

00:02:46,140  -->  00:02:48,680
together like it it's there so

141

00:02:48,680  -->  00:02:48,690

142

00:02:48,690  -->  00:02:50,180
insignificant that there's no point in

143

00:02:50,180  -->  00:02:50,190

144

00:02:50,190  -->  00:02:51,740
analyzing them separately and for the

145

00:02:51,740  -->  00:02:51,750

146

00:02:51,750  -->  00:02:53,300
purpose of your analysis you want to put

147

00:02:53,300  -->  00:02:53,310

148

00:02:53,310  -->  00:02:54,920
them together you want to put them

149

00:02:54,920  -->  00:02:54,930

150

00:02:54,930  -->  00:02:57,740
together in a group and that is when

151

00:02:57,740  -->  00:02:57,750

152

00:02:57,750  -->  00:03:00,050
groups come into play. So groups are ways

153

00:03:00,050  -->  00:03:00,060

154

00:03:00,060  -->  00:03:04,370
you can combine elements of your

155

00:03:04,370  -->  00:03:04,380

156

00:03:04,380  -->  00:03:06,800
dimension so in this specific case we're

157

00:03:06,800  -->  00:03:06,810

158

00:03:06,810  -->  00:03:08,540
looking at a dimension which is called year

159

00:03:08,540  -->  00:03:08,550

160

00:03:08,550  -->  00:03:11,810
founded and we want to group these

161

00:03:11,810  -->  00:03:11,820

162

00:03:11,820  -->  00:03:19,010
elements  1,9 1999 to 2008. So if you

163

00:03:19,010  -->  00:03:19,020

164

00:03:19,020  -->  00:03:22,250
want to group these years into one group

165

00:03:22,250  -->  00:03:22,260

166

00:03:22,260  -->  00:03:25,430
within this dimension. So basically what that

167

00:03:25,430  -->  00:03:25,440

168

00:03:25,440  -->  00:03:27,110
means is you have to have a dimension to

169

00:03:27,110  -->  00:03:27,120

170

00:03:27,120  -->  00:03:30,290
create a group and now if we select them

171

00:03:30,290  -->  00:03:30,300

172

00:03:30,300  -->  00:03:32,150
or actually need to select the years

173

00:03:32,150  -->  00:03:32,160

174

00:03:32,160  -->  00:03:35,300
themselves and then we put our mouse

175

00:03:35,300  -->  00:03:35,310

176

00:03:35,310  -->  00:03:38,180
over it over any one of them. What you'll

177

00:03:38,180  -->  00:03:38,190

178

00:03:38,190  -->  00:03:40,130
see is in the tooltip you have this

179

00:03:40,130  -->  00:03:40,140

180

00:03:40,140  -->  00:03:43,940
paperclip icon and it says group members.

181

00:03:43,940  -->  00:03:43,950

182

00:03:43,950  -->  00:03:46,430
So let's go ahead and click that. Right

183

00:03:46,430  -->  00:03:46,440

184

00:03:46,440  -->  00:03:47,810
away what you can see is that they have been

185

00:03:47,810  -->  00:03:47,820

186

00:03:47,820  -->  00:03:49,550
combined together and the sum, the total

187

00:03:49,550  -->  00:03:49,560

188

00:03:49,560  -->  00:03:53,600
for those years has been represented

189

00:03:53,600  -->  00:03:53,610

190

00:03:53,610  -->  00:03:56,510
here. So if I right-click now and I

191

00:03:56,510  -->  00:03:56,520

192

00:03:56,520  -->  00:03:59,720
change the name so added alias and I say

193

00:03:59,720  -->  00:03:59,730

194

00:03:59,730  -->  00:04:07,910
before 2009 then now I have a new

195

00:04:07,910  -->  00:04:07,920

196

00:04:07,920  -->  00:04:11,840
element in my dimension and in fact I

197

00:04:11,840  -->  00:04:11,850

198

00:04:11,850  -->  00:04:13,370
have a new dimension so if you look here

199

00:04:13,370  -->  00:04:13,380

200

00:04:13,380  -->  00:04:15,500
this is the old dimension hasn't changed

201

00:04:15,500  -->  00:04:15,510

202

00:04:15,510  -->  00:04:17,270
with this is the new dimension so if I

203

00:04:17,270  -->  00:04:17,280

204

00:04:17,280  -->  00:04:19,580
take the old dimension and drag it instead of

205

00:04:19,580  -->  00:04:19,590

206

00:04:19,590  -->  00:04:20,900
the new dimension we still have the old

207

00:04:20,900  -->  00:04:20,910

208

00:04:20,910  -->  00:04:23,150
chart but now I have a new dimension

209

00:04:23,150  -->  00:04:23,160

210

00:04:23,160  -->  00:04:26,240
which no longer has these years which

211

00:04:26,240  -->  00:04:26,250

212

00:04:26,250  -->  00:04:27,350
only has

213

00:04:27,350  -->  00:04:27,360

214

00:04:27,360  -->  00:04:29,929
a year or a category which represents

215

00:04:29,929  -->  00:04:29,939

216

00:04:29,939  -->  00:04:31,969
all these years. If I drag it here you

217

00:04:31,969  -->  00:04:31,979

218

00:04:31,979  -->  00:04:35,270
will see exactly what I mean that we

219

00:04:35,270  -->  00:04:35,280

220

00:04:35,280  -->  00:04:37,309
only have this category here and now

221

00:04:37,309  -->  00:04:37,319

222

00:04:37,319  -->  00:04:39,140
basically we're working with a new

223

00:04:39,140  -->  00:04:39,150

224

00:04:39,150  -->  00:04:41,450
dimension which only has one two three

225

00:04:41,450  -->  00:04:41,460

226

00:04:41,460  -->  00:04:44,240
four five six seven characters. Now let's

227

00:04:44,240  -->  00:04:44,250

228

00:04:44,250  -->  00:04:45,890
say you wanted to fix up this group,

229

00:04:45,890  -->  00:04:45,900

230

00:04:45,900  -->  00:04:48,439
let's say you wanted to include 2009 in

231

00:04:48,439  -->  00:04:48,449

232

00:04:48,449  -->  00:04:50,839
the group and have 2010 onwards

233

00:04:50,839  -->  00:04:50,849

234

00:04:50,849  -->  00:04:53,600
separately. You can easily do that if you

235

00:04:53,600  -->  00:04:53,610

236

00:04:53,610  -->  00:04:55,909
right-click the group and click edit

237

00:04:55,909  -->  00:04:55,919

238

00:04:55,919  -->  00:05:00,709
group, you can expand this group here and

239

00:05:00,709  -->  00:05:00,719

240

00:05:00,719  -->  00:05:03,230
then just take 2009 and drag it into the

241

00:05:03,230  -->  00:05:03,240

242

00:05:03,240  -->  00:05:06,649
group or alternatively if you drag it

243

00:05:06,649  -->  00:05:06,659

244

00:05:06,659  -->  00:05:08,510
out so you can select here you can

245

00:05:08,510  -->  00:05:08,520

246

00:05:08,520  -->  00:05:11,119
select add to this group and will be

247

00:05:11,119  -->  00:05:11,129

248

00:05:11,129  -->  00:05:14,360
added, then you click apply and there you

249

00:05:14,360  -->  00:05:14,370

250

00:05:14,370  -->  00:05:16,550
go now you just have to of course change

251

00:05:16,550  -->  00:05:16,560

252

00:05:16,560  -->  00:05:19,459
the name of the group because it's not

253

00:05:19,459  -->  00:05:19,469

254

00:05:19,469  -->  00:05:26,600
before 2009, it's a before maybe 2009 and

255

00:05:26,600  -->  00:05:26,610

256

00:05:26,610  -->  00:05:28,010
before.

257

00:05:28,010  -->  00:05:28,020

258

00:05:28,020  -->  00:05:32,959
Alright, so that's how you can create a

259

00:05:32,959  -->  00:05:32,969

260

00:05:32,969  -->  00:05:36,110
group using your chart. Now let's look at

261

00:05:36,110  -->  00:05:36,120

262

00:05:36,120  -->  00:05:37,730
another type of group, when would you

263

00:05:37,730  -->  00:05:37,740

264

00:05:37,740  -->  00:05:40,159
want to create a group? Here we'll just

265

00:05:40,159  -->  00:05:40,169

266

00:05:40,169  -->  00:05:43,820
call this years and this one will call

267

00:05:43,820  -->  00:05:43,830

268

00:05:43,830  -->  00:05:50,089
industries. So here let's look at

269

00:05:50,089  -->  00:05:50,099

270

00:05:50,099  -->  00:05:53,779
industry and we'll put it into rows and

271

00:05:53,779  -->  00:05:53,789

272

00:05:53,789  -->  00:05:55,670
we want to see the total number of

273

00:05:55,670  -->  00:05:55,680

274

00:05:55,680  -->  00:05:58,189
columns or let's say we want to see the

275

00:05:58,189  -->  00:05:58,199

276

00:05:58,199  -->  00:05:59,659
total number of employees in each

277

00:05:59,659  -->  00:05:59,669

278

00:05:59,669  -->  00:06:03,740
industry so we click total over there

279

00:06:03,740  -->  00:06:03,750

280

00:06:03,750  -->  00:06:06,649
and let's say we don't want to look at

281

00:06:06,649  -->  00:06:06,659

282

00:06:06,659  -->  00:06:08,390
sum of employees, we want to look at

283

00:06:08,390  -->  00:06:08,400

284

00:06:08,400  -->  00:06:10,550
the average, average number of employees

285

00:06:10,550  -->  00:06:10,560

286

00:06:10,560  -->  00:06:12,499
in these companies and let's sort it by

287

00:06:12,499  -->  00:06:12,509

288

00:06:12,509  -->  00:06:16,879
number of employees like that. So what

289

00:06:16,879  -->  00:06:16,889

290

00:06:16,889  -->  00:06:18,439
when would we want to create a group

291

00:06:18,439  -->  00:06:18,449

292

00:06:18,449  -->  00:06:22,189
here, well let's say that your industries

293

00:06:22,189  -->  00:06:22,199

294

00:06:22,199  -->  00:06:26,749
here we've got IT services, we've got software

295

00:06:26,749  -->  00:06:26,759

296

00:06:26,759  -->  00:06:29,600
and it was one more somewhere here

297

00:06:29,600  -->  00:06:29,610

298

00:06:29,610  -->  00:06:33,589
computer and hardware so we've got three

299

00:06:33,589  -->  00:06:33,599

300

00:06:33,599  -->  00:06:35,480
in industries which are kind of related

301

00:06:35,480  -->  00:06:35,490

302

00:06:35,490  -->  00:06:39,709
to IT in general. So how about we combine

303

00:06:39,709  -->  00:06:39,719

304

00:06:39,719  -->  00:06:40,640
them into 1

305

00:06:40,640  -->  00:06:40,650

306

00:06:40,650  -->  00:06:42,800
industry. We create a group for that, so

307

00:06:42,800  -->  00:06:42,810

308

00:06:42,810  -->  00:06:45,260
we can do it through the chart so once

309

00:06:45,260  -->  00:06:45,270

310

00:06:45,270  -->  00:06:48,590
again if we select them and we bring all

311

00:06:48,590  -->  00:06:48,600

312

00:06:48,600  -->  00:06:50,629
you have to press control just like them, we

313

00:06:50,629  -->  00:06:50,639

314

00:06:50,639  -->  00:06:52,520
bring up on mouse, we can use this icon

315

00:06:52,520  -->  00:06:52,530

316

00:06:52,530  -->  00:06:55,340
over here or we can go to the industry

317

00:06:55,340  -->  00:06:55,350

318

00:06:55,350  -->  00:06:58,909
dimension and right click it. We go to

319

00:06:58,909  -->  00:06:58,919

320

00:06:58,919  -->  00:07:02,270
create and then go to group and here we

321

00:07:02,270  -->  00:07:02,280

322

00:07:02,280  -->  00:07:05,120
want to select the industries that were

323

00:07:05,120  -->  00:07:05,130

324

00:07:05,130  -->  00:07:10,820
looking for IT services, software and

325

00:07:10,820  -->  00:07:10,830

326

00:07:10,830  -->  00:07:13,430
where was other one computer hardware.

327

00:07:13,430  -->  00:07:13,440

328

00:07:13,440  -->  00:07:16,490
Right so we want to group them and this

329

00:07:16,490  -->  00:07:16,500

330

00:07:16,500  -->  00:07:19,159
one will call it information technology,

331

00:07:19,159  -->  00:07:19,169

332

00:07:19,169  -->  00:07:26,060
click enter and then click apply and now

333

00:07:26,060  -->  00:07:26,070

334

00:07:26,070  -->  00:07:27,800
as you can see nothing has changed here

335

00:07:27,800  -->  00:07:27,810

336

00:07:27,810  -->  00:07:29,240
but that's because we've just created a

337

00:07:29,240  -->  00:07:29,250

338

00:07:29,250  -->  00:07:30,890
new group and we still have to drag it

339

00:07:30,890  -->  00:07:30,900

340

00:07:30,900  -->  00:07:34,279
onto our road shelf. Once again, let's

341

00:07:34,279  -->  00:07:34,289

342

00:07:34,289  -->  00:07:37,460
order that and now we should see that we

343

00:07:37,460  -->  00:07:37,470

344

00:07:37,470  -->  00:07:39,890
have information technology and once

345

00:07:39,890  -->  00:07:39,900

346

00:07:39,900  -->  00:07:41,180
again if we want to add another element

347

00:07:41,180  -->  00:07:41,190

348

00:07:41,190  -->  00:07:43,040
let's say telecommunications very easy

349

00:07:43,040  -->  00:07:43,050

350

00:07:43,050  -->  00:07:46,580
to do you just go to industry group and

351

00:07:46,580  -->  00:07:46,590

352

00:07:46,590  -->  00:07:49,010
edit group and then you find the one you

353

00:07:49,010  -->  00:07:49,020

354

00:07:49,020  -->  00:07:51,860
want to add so here we're looking for

355

00:07:51,860  -->  00:07:51,870

356

00:07:51,870  -->  00:07:53,960
telecommunications and then you just add

357

00:07:53,960  -->  00:07:53,970

358

00:07:53,970  -->  00:07:56,480
to your group and click apply.

359

00:07:56,480  -->  00:07:56,490

360

00:07:56,490  -->  00:07:59,060
Alright so we've learned how to create

361

00:07:59,060  -->  00:07:59,070

362

00:07:59,070  -->  00:08:00,620
groups and how they work

363

00:08:00,620  -->  00:08:00,630

364

00:08:00,630  -->  00:08:02,450
let me show you one more quick thing

365

00:08:02,450  -->  00:08:02,460

366

00:08:02,460  -->  00:08:04,129
because this is an advanced course and I

367

00:08:04,129  -->  00:08:04,139

368

00:08:04,139  -->  00:08:06,740
really want you guys to understand

369

00:08:06,740  -->  00:08:06,750

370

00:08:06,750  -->  00:08:09,020
everything to the depths of the depths

371

00:08:09,020  -->  00:08:09,030

372

00:08:09,030  -->  00:08:12,170
that you that how Tableau works so let's

373

00:08:12,170  -->  00:08:12,180

374

00:08:12,180  -->  00:08:16,189
drag average employees onto a label and

375

00:08:16,189  -->  00:08:16,199

376

00:08:16,199  -->  00:08:18,980
let me just format this quickly so we

377

00:08:18,980  -->  00:08:18,990

378

00:08:18,990  -->  00:08:21,230
can see a bit better and a bit more.

379

00:08:21,230  -->  00:08:21,240

380

00:08:21,240  -->  00:08:23,510
Right so those are average employees

381

00:08:23,510  -->  00:08:23,520

382

00:08:23,520  -->  00:08:26,300
right now in each of the industries. Now

383

00:08:26,300  -->  00:08:26,310

384

00:08:26,310  -->  00:08:30,469
when we group there's always when you're

385

00:08:30,469  -->  00:08:30,479

386

00:08:30,479  -->  00:08:32,449
grouping something that is calculating

387

00:08:32,449  -->  00:08:32,459

388

00:08:32,459  -->  00:08:35,060
average is always a risk or concern

389

00:08:35,060  -->  00:08:35,070

390

00:08:35,070  -->  00:08:36,769
maybe the grouping is going to count

391

00:08:36,769  -->  00:08:36,779

392

00:08:36,779  -->  00:08:40,399
average of averages so let's take two

393

00:08:40,399  -->  00:08:40,409

394

00:08:40,409  -->  00:08:42,890
more for example here let's take

395

00:08:42,890  -->  00:08:42,900

396

00:08:42,900  -->  00:08:45,170
construction and environmental services

397

00:08:45,170  -->  00:08:45,180

398

00:08:45,180  -->  00:08:47,269
right so when we, when I group them,

399

00:08:47,269  -->  00:08:47,279

400

00:08:47,279  -->  00:08:50,269
right now if I if I turn them into group,

401

00:08:50,269  -->  00:08:50,279

402

00:08:50,279  -->  00:08:51,890
will this

403

00:08:51,890  -->  00:08:51,900

404

00:08:51,900  -->  00:08:54,770
resulting category would it have the

405

00:08:54,770  -->  00:08:54,780

406

00:08:54,780  -->  00:08:56,600
average of averages all the average be

407

00:08:56,600  -->  00:08:56,610

408

00:08:56,610  -->  00:08:58,190
calculated correctly so what I mean is

409

00:08:58,190  -->  00:08:58,200

410

00:08:58,200  -->  00:09:00,890
right now there might be 10 companies in

411

00:09:00,890  -->  00:09:00,900

412

00:09:00,900  -->  00:09:03,920
this sector and there might be 5

413

00:09:03,920  -->  00:09:03,930

414

00:09:03,930  -->  00:09:05,690
companies in this sector. So the average

415

00:09:05,690  -->  00:09:05,700

416

00:09:05,700  -->  00:09:07,520
for those five companies is this for the

417

00:09:07,520  -->  00:09:07,530

418

00:09:07,530  -->  00:09:09,170
average for those 10 companies is this

419

00:09:09,170  -->  00:09:09,180

420

00:09:09,180  -->  00:09:12,410
when I group them will Tableau take the

421

00:09:12,410  -->  00:09:12,420

422

00:09:12,420  -->  00:09:14,510
average of these two values or will be

423

00:09:14,510  -->  00:09:14,520

424

00:09:14,520  -->  00:09:16,190
able to take the average of the 15

425

00:09:16,190  -->  00:09:16,200

426

00:09:16,200  -->  00:09:18,170
values? The correct approach would be to

427

00:09:18,170  -->  00:09:18,180

428

00:09:18,180  -->  00:09:20,060
take the average of the 15 values,

429

00:09:20,060  -->  00:09:20,070

430

00:09:20,070  -->  00:09:21,470
let's go ahead and see what Tableau does.

431

00:09:21,470  -->  00:09:21,480

432

00:09:21,480  -->  00:09:24,980
So I'm going to click group and I get

433

00:09:24,980  -->  00:09:24,990

434

00:09:24,990  -->  00:09:30,230
61.1 so let me bring up a calculator and

435

00:09:30,230  -->  00:09:30,240

436

00:09:30,240  -->  00:09:34,010
here we will see what would have

437

00:09:34,010  -->  00:09:34,020

438

00:09:34,020  -->  00:09:37,760
happened. So if I click control z and

439

00:09:37,760  -->  00:09:37,770

440

00:09:37,770  -->  00:09:44,270
now I take 57.9 plus 78.0 divide it by 2 so

441

00:09:44,270  -->  00:09:44,280

442

00:09:44,280  -->  00:09:46,370
this is what the average of averages

443

00:09:46,370  -->  00:09:46,380

444

00:09:46,380  -->  00:09:49,880
would be 67.95. Now if you group them,

445

00:09:49,880  -->  00:09:49,890

446

00:09:49,890  -->  00:09:53,270
we get 61.1 so what that is telling us

447

00:09:53,270  -->  00:09:53,280

448

00:09:53,280  -->  00:09:56,480
is that Tableau is smart. It's not taking

449

00:09:56,480  -->  00:09:56,490

450

00:09:56,490  -->  00:09:58,040
the average of those two averages, it's

451

00:09:58,040  -->  00:09:58,050

452

00:09:58,050  -->  00:09:59,990
actually taking the correct average

453

00:09:59,990  -->  00:10:00,000

454

00:10:00,000  -->  00:10:02,930
number of employees for all the companies

455

00:10:02,930  -->  00:10:02,940

456

00:10:02,940  -->  00:10:05,270
in these two industries and that is

457

00:10:05,270  -->  00:10:05,280

458

00:10:05,280  -->  00:10:07,730
important to understand and also

459

00:10:07,730  -->  00:10:07,740

460

00:10:07,740  -->  00:10:09,980
important to know because that will give

461

00:10:09,980  -->  00:10:09,990

462

00:10:09,990  -->  00:10:11,870
you confidence when you are using groups

463

00:10:11,870  -->  00:10:11,880

464

00:10:11,880  -->  00:10:14,060
that what you essentially done just now

465

00:10:14,060  -->  00:10:14,070

466

00:10:14,070  -->  00:10:16,430
what we've done here is not just put

467

00:10:16,430  -->  00:10:16,440

468

00:10:16,440  -->  00:10:18,950
together the result of aggregation of

469

00:10:18,950  -->  00:10:18,960

470

00:10:18,960  -->  00:10:20,630
the two groups who have actually changed

471

00:10:20,630  -->  00:10:20,640

472

00:10:20,640  -->  00:10:24,260
the metadata. We've changed we haven't

473

00:10:24,260  -->  00:10:24,270

474

00:10:24,270  -->  00:10:25,550
changed the data because we can't

475

00:10:25,550  -->  00:10:25,560

476

00:10:25,560  -->  00:10:27,380
actually choose whatever we do here

477

00:10:27,380  -->  00:10:27,390

478

00:10:27,390  -->  00:10:29,480
doesn't change the data set itself but

479

00:10:29,480  -->  00:10:29,490

480

00:10:29,490  -->  00:10:31,820
we have changed the data the Tableau is

481

00:10:31,820  -->  00:10:31,830

482

00:10:31,830  -->  00:10:34,730
working with, so now in Tableau's

483

00:10:34,730  -->  00:10:34,740

484

00:10:34,740  -->  00:10:36,860
perception these two industries are

485

00:10:36,860  -->  00:10:36,870

486

00:10:36,870  -->  00:10:38,720
actually one industry and all the

487

00:10:38,720  -->  00:10:38,730

488

00:10:38,730  -->  00:10:41,990
companies so 5 plus 10 to 15 companies

489

00:10:41,990  -->  00:10:42,000

490

00:10:42,000  -->  00:10:43,520
belong to that industry and any

491

00:10:43,520  -->  00:10:43,530

492

00:10:43,530  -->  00:10:45,440
aggregations that you do will be done

493

00:10:45,440  -->  00:10:45,450

494

00:10:45,450  -->  00:10:47,810
correctly. So that is why Tableau has

495

00:10:47,810  -->  00:10:47,820

496

00:10:47,820  -->  00:10:49,790
61.1 here.

497

00:10:49,790  -->  00:10:49,800

498

00:10:49,800  -->  00:10:51,530
Alright so that's all for today that's

499

00:10:51,530  -->  00:10:51,540

500

00:10:51,540  -->  00:10:53,090
how you work with groups and that's how

501

00:10:53,090  -->  00:10:53,100

502

00:10:53,100  -->  00:10:55,400
you can use them to adjust your metadata

503

00:10:55,400  -->  00:10:55,410

504

00:10:55,410  -->  00:10:58,040
if that is required and in the next

505

00:10:58,040  -->  00:10:58,050

510

00:11:01,290  -->  00:11:02,600
time and until then,
