00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,140

00:00:05,300  -->  00:00:07,150
Hello this is Kirill and welcome back

3

00:00:07,200  -->  00:00:07,210

4

00:00:07,210  -->  00:00:09,629
to the advanced course on Tableau and

5

00:00:09,629  -->  00:00:09,639

6

00:00:09,639  -->  00:00:11,340
today we're going to build this

7

00:00:11,340  -->  00:00:11,350

8

00:00:11,350  -->  00:00:13,650
visualization. So as we discussed we're

9

00:00:13,650  -->  00:00:13,660

10

00:00:13,660  -->  00:00:15,990
going to use the population data set as

11

00:00:15,990  -->  00:00:16,000

12

00:00:16,000  -->  00:00:18,359
our primary data set for the blend in

13

00:00:18,359  -->  00:00:18,369

14

00:00:18,369  -->  00:00:20,760
Tableau and for that to happen we have

15

00:00:20,760  -->  00:00:20,770

16

00:00:20,770  -->  00:00:24,810
to use our first field in this dashboard

17

00:00:24,810  -->  00:00:24,820

18

00:00:24,820  -->  00:00:28,230
from this data set. So let's go ahead and

19

00:00:28,230  -->  00:00:28,240

20

00:00:28,240  -->  00:00:30,270
take population and we know that we want

21

00:00:30,270  -->  00:00:30,280

22

00:00:30,280  -->  00:00:32,040
population to be the size of the bubble

23

00:00:32,040  -->  00:00:32,050

24

00:00:32,050  -->  00:00:34,709
so let's drag it into size. Okay as you

25

00:00:34,709  -->  00:00:34,719

26

00:00:34,719  -->  00:00:36,899
can see there's a a blue indicator here,

27

00:00:36,899  -->  00:00:36,909

28

00:00:36,909  -->  00:00:38,310
telling us that this is now the

29

00:00:38,310  -->  00:00:38,320

30

00:00:38,320  -->  00:00:40,470
primary data source. Now that's great now

31

00:00:40,470  -->  00:00:40,480

32

00:00:40,480  -->  00:00:41,970
let's move on to the next one, fertility

33

00:00:41,970  -->  00:00:41,980

34

00:00:41,980  -->  00:00:44,759
rate let's connect to this data source

35

00:00:44,759  -->  00:00:44,769

36

00:00:44,769  -->  00:00:47,340
let's initiate the blend by clicking

37

00:00:47,340  -->  00:00:47,350

38

00:00:47,350  -->  00:00:49,950
these two indicators here and from this

39

00:00:49,950  -->  00:00:49,960

40

00:00:49,960  -->  00:00:52,079
data set we want the fertility rate and

41

00:00:52,079  -->  00:00:52,089

42

00:00:52,089  -->  00:00:54,450
we wanted to be on the horizontal axis.

43

00:00:54,450  -->  00:00:54,460

44

00:00:54,460  -->  00:00:56,729
Perfect let's move on to the next one.

45

00:00:56,729  -->  00:00:56,739

46

00:00:56,739  -->  00:00:58,799
Life expectancy at birth,

47

00:00:58,799  -->  00:00:58,809

48

00:00:58,809  -->  00:01:00,629
now from here we want the life

49

00:01:00,629  -->  00:01:00,639

50

00:01:00,639  -->  00:01:02,669
expectancy at birth indicator, I'm not

51

00:01:02,669  -->  00:01:02,679

52

00:01:02,679  -->  00:01:04,170
going to click these indicators to show

53

00:01:04,170  -->  00:01:04,180

54

00:01:04,180  -->  00:01:06,090
you what will happen if I drag it into

55

00:01:06,090  -->  00:01:06,100

56

00:01:06,100  -->  00:01:08,130
the vertical axis. We get an error

57

00:01:08,130  -->  00:01:08,140

58

00:01:08,140  -->  00:01:09,840
telling us that the blend has not been

59

00:01:09,840  -->  00:01:09,850

60

00:01:09,850  -->  00:01:11,880
initiated and that's because as you

61

00:01:11,880  -->  00:01:11,890

62

00:01:11,890  -->  00:01:14,400
remember the plan would only be

63

00:01:14,400  -->  00:01:14,410

64

00:01:14,410  -->  00:01:16,320
initiated automatically if you actually

65

00:01:16,320  -->  00:01:16,330

66

00:01:16,330  -->  00:01:18,000
use one of these fields in your

67

00:01:18,000  -->  00:01:18,010

68

00:01:18,010  -->  00:01:19,920
visualization. If that's not the case,

69

00:01:19,920  -->  00:01:19,930

70

00:01:19,930  -->  00:01:22,260
then you have to initiate the blend

71

00:01:22,260  -->  00:01:22,270

72

00:01:22,270  -->  00:01:23,190
yourself.

73

00:01:23,190  -->  00:01:23,200

74

00:01:23,200  -->  00:01:25,350
There we go that fixed up the error and

75

00:01:25,350  -->  00:01:25,360

76

00:01:25,360  -->  00:01:28,410
finally to this data set, the metadata

77

00:01:28,410  -->  00:01:28,420

78

00:01:28,420  -->  00:01:31,050
for countries we want the region and we

79

00:01:31,050  -->  00:01:31,060

80

00:01:31,060  -->  00:01:33,450
wanted it to be color. So let's drag it or

81

00:01:33,450  -->  00:01:33,460

82

00:01:33,460  -->  00:01:35,400
first let's initiate the blend and drag

83

00:01:35,400  -->  00:01:35,410

84

00:01:35,410  -->  00:01:38,070
region into color. Perfect now we've got

85

00:01:38,070  -->  00:01:38,080

86

00:01:38,080  -->  00:01:40,650
some colors for different regions and

87

00:01:40,650  -->  00:01:40,660

88

00:01:40,660  -->  00:01:43,620
this is all aggregated data. What we want

89

00:01:43,620  -->  00:01:43,630

90

00:01:43,630  -->  00:01:47,100
is a mark for every single country, so

91

00:01:47,100  -->  00:01:47,110

92

00:01:47,110  -->  00:01:48,420
let's go ahead and go back to our

93

00:01:48,420  -->  00:01:48,430

94

00:01:48,430  -->  00:01:51,330
original data set and here we're going

95

00:01:51,330  -->  00:01:51,340

96

00:01:51,340  -->  00:01:54,390
to take country name so you can annotate

97

00:01:54,390  -->  00:01:54,400

98

00:01:54,400  -->  00:01:56,040
country code, country name but we're going to

99

00:01:56,040  -->  00:01:56,050

100

00:01:56,050  -->  00:01:58,170
country name and we're going to drag it

101

00:01:58,170  -->  00:01:58,180

102

00:01:58,180  -->  00:02:01,110
into detail. Now this gives us lots of

103

00:02:01,110  -->  00:02:01,120

104

00:02:01,120  -->  00:02:04,800
marks and what is going on right now is

105

00:02:04,800  -->  00:02:04,810

106

00:02:04,810  -->  00:02:07,680
a not exactly what we want because here

107

00:02:07,680  -->  00:02:07,690

108

00:02:07,690  -->  00:02:09,600
you can see life expectancy at birth and

109

00:02:09,600  -->  00:02:09,610

110

00:02:09,610  -->  00:02:11,970
it's thousands of years and I hope you,

111

00:02:11,970  -->  00:02:12,470

112

00:02:12,470  -->  00:02:13,800
we wish, we must be live that long

113

00:02:13,800  -->  00:02:13,810

114

00:02:13,810  -->  00:02:15,840
but that's not the case and that is

115

00:02:15,840  -->  00:02:15,850

116

00:02:15,850  -->  00:02:16,510
because

117

00:02:16,510  -->  00:02:16,520

118

00:02:16,520  -->  00:02:18,640
the data has been summed for all of

119

00:02:18,640  -->  00:02:18,650

120

00:02:18,650  -->  00:02:20,950
the years and that's very easy to fix so

121

00:02:20,950  -->  00:02:20,960

122

00:02:20,960  -->  00:02:21,970
what we're going to do is we're going to

123

00:02:21,970  -->  00:02:21,980

124

00:02:21,980  -->  00:02:23,560
take a year and will drag it into

125

00:02:23,560  -->  00:02:23,570

126

00:02:23,570  -->  00:02:25,210
filters and we'll just select one year.

127

00:02:25,210  -->  00:02:25,220

128

00:02:25,220  -->  00:02:27,460
So let's start with 1960 and click OK,

129

00:02:27,460  -->  00:02:27,470

130

00:02:27,470  -->  00:02:29,500
and there we go now our data set is

131

00:02:29,500  -->  00:02:29,510

132

00:02:29,510  -->  00:02:31,990
correct. So a couple more things that we

133

00:02:31,990  -->  00:02:32,000

134

00:02:32,000  -->  00:02:34,360
need to do is of course fix up the size

135

00:02:34,360  -->  00:02:34,370

136

00:02:34,370  -->  00:02:36,190
and the mark we're using so instead of

137

00:02:36,190  -->  00:02:36,200

138

00:02:36,200  -->  00:02:38,530
empty circles are going to use filled

139

00:02:38,530  -->  00:02:38,540

140

00:02:38,540  -->  00:02:40,780
circles and we're going to increase the

141

00:02:40,780  -->  00:02:40,790

142

00:02:40,790  -->  00:02:43,480
size here a bit but as you can see as we

143

00:02:43,480  -->  00:02:43,490

144

00:02:43,490  -->  00:02:45,250
increase the size the tiny bubbles are

145

00:02:45,250  -->  00:02:45,260

146

00:02:45,260  -->  00:02:46,840
not getting that much bigger but the big

147

00:02:46,840  -->  00:02:46,850

148

00:02:46,850  -->  00:02:49,390
ones are really growing. So to fix that

149

00:02:49,390  -->  00:02:49,400

150

00:02:49,400  -->  00:02:53,080
what you want to do is go into this menu

151

00:02:53,080  -->  00:02:53,090

152

00:02:53,090  -->  00:02:54,640
here into this legend click the

153

00:02:54,640  -->  00:02:54,650

154

00:02:54,650  -->  00:02:57,520
drop-down and select edit sizes and

155

00:02:57,520  -->  00:02:57,530

156

00:02:57,530  -->  00:02:59,320
instead of saying automatically saved by

157

00:02:59,320  -->  00:02:59,330

158

00:02:59,330  -->  00:03:02,710
range and then increase this one a bit

159

00:03:02,710  -->  00:03:02,720

160

00:03:02,720  -->  00:03:04,330
on the left and click apply.

161

00:03:04,330  -->  00:03:04,340

162

00:03:04,340  -->  00:03:06,340
That's way too much just look at this

163

00:03:06,340  -->  00:03:06,350

164

00:03:06,350  -->  00:03:07,900
bubble over here and you can see how it

165

00:03:07,900  -->  00:03:07,910

166

00:03:07,910  -->  00:03:09,610
changes so that's way too much,

167

00:03:09,610  -->  00:03:09,620

168

00:03:09,620  -->  00:03:11,530
that's way too little but maybe that

169

00:03:11,530  -->  00:03:11,540

170

00:03:11,540  -->  00:03:14,350
should be about right maybe a bit, a bit

171

00:03:14,350  -->  00:03:14,360

172

00:03:14,360  -->  00:03:15,730
smaller than that.

173

00:03:15,730  -->  00:03:15,740

174

00:03:15,740  -->  00:03:19,270
Ok so that is looking a bit better maybe

175

00:03:19,270  -->  00:03:19,280

176

00:03:19,280  -->  00:03:22,090
make the big ones also a bit smaller now

177

00:03:22,090  -->  00:03:22,100

178

00:03:22,100  -->  00:03:23,800
it's too small.

179

00:03:23,800  -->  00:03:23,810

180

00:03:23,810  -->  00:03:25,690
That was actually better, alright so play

181

00:03:25,690  -->  00:03:25,700

182

00:03:25,700  -->  00:03:26,920
around with that and see what you're

183

00:03:26,920  -->  00:03:26,930

184

00:03:26,930  -->  00:03:27,850
comfortable with.

185

00:03:27,850  -->  00:03:27,860

186

00:03:27,860  -->  00:03:29,949
Next we want of you can see here that

187

00:03:29,949  -->  00:03:29,959

188

00:03:29,959  -->  00:03:32,170
they're kind of merging together and we

189

00:03:32,170  -->  00:03:32,180

190

00:03:32,180  -->  00:03:34,240
don't want that so we're going to give

191

00:03:34,240  -->  00:03:34,250

192

00:03:34,250  -->  00:03:37,930
us some transparency make it a 75 and

193

00:03:37,930  -->  00:03:37,940

194

00:03:37,940  -->  00:03:40,510
we're going to give it a border so black

195

00:03:40,510  -->  00:03:40,520

196

00:03:40,520  -->  00:03:42,130
is too rough,

197

00:03:42,130  -->  00:03:42,140

198

00:03:42,140  -->  00:03:44,260
usually I go not this black and not the

199

00:03:44,260  -->  00:03:44,270

200

00:03:44,270  -->  00:03:46,270
somewhere like either this one or this

201

00:03:46,270  -->  00:03:46,280

202

00:03:46,280  -->  00:03:46,960
one.

203

00:03:46,960  -->  00:03:46,970

204

00:03:46,970  -->  00:03:48,160
In this case I'm going to use this one.

205

00:03:48,160  -->  00:03:48,170

206

00:03:48,170  -->  00:03:51,220
So it still stands out, but it's not that

207

00:03:51,220  -->  00:03:51,230

208

00:03:51,230  -->  00:03:54,220
blunt. It's a bit gray, so that looks

209

00:03:54,220  -->  00:03:54,230

210

00:03:54,230  -->  00:03:57,070
good what else do I want to do and

211

00:03:57,070  -->  00:03:57,080

212

00:03:57,080  -->  00:03:58,630
finally want to change the colors, right?

213

00:03:58,630  -->  00:03:58,640

214

00:03:58,640  -->  00:04:01,870
So I've got some thoughts already I want

215

00:04:01,870  -->  00:04:01,880

216

00:04:01,880  -->  00:04:04,390
like Europe to be blue, like Latin

217

00:04:04,390  -->  00:04:04,400

218

00:04:04,400  -->  00:04:07,780
America to be orange, Middle East

219

00:04:07,780  -->  00:04:07,790

220

00:04:07,790  -->  00:04:12,490
let's select a maybe this but I want to

221

00:04:12,490  -->  00:04:12,500

222

00:04:12,500  -->  00:04:14,860
change it to more of this type of yellow,

223

00:04:14,860  -->  00:04:14,870

224

00:04:14,870  -->  00:04:20,949
North America maybe green, South Asia Brown,

225

00:04:20,949  -->  00:04:20,959

226

00:04:20,959  -->  00:04:22,440
can see brown,

227

00:04:22,440  -->  00:04:22,450

228

00:04:22,450  -->  00:04:26,700
Sub Saharan Africa maybe always make it

229

00:04:26,700  -->  00:04:26,710

230

00:04:26,710  -->  00:04:30,600
blue this blue, and finally East Asia

231

00:04:30,600  -->  00:04:30,610

232

00:04:30,610  -->  00:04:33,300
we're going to make it red here, click

233

00:04:33,300  -->  00:04:33,310

234

00:04:33,310  -->  00:04:35,370
apply and one final thing that we want

235

00:04:35,370  -->  00:04:35,380

236

00:04:35,380  -->  00:04:37,380
to do is go to analysis and uncheck

237

00:04:37,380  -->  00:04:37,390

238

00:04:37,390  -->  00:04:39,120
aggregate measures and even though that

239

00:04:39,120  -->  00:04:39,130

240

00:04:39,130  -->  00:04:41,640
doesn't do anything because we are at

241

00:04:41,640  -->  00:04:41,650

242

00:04:41,650  -->  00:04:44,310
the highest level of granularity at the

243

00:04:44,310  -->  00:04:44,320

244

00:04:44,320  -->  00:04:46,350
level of country, we still want to do

245

00:04:46,350  -->  00:04:46,360

246

00:04:46,360  -->  00:04:49,800
that just as a good practice kind of

247

00:04:49,800  -->  00:04:49,810

248

00:04:49,810  -->  00:04:51,630
approach so that the next person that's

249

00:04:51,630  -->  00:04:51,640

250

00:04:51,640  -->  00:04:53,250
looking at your dashboard he can right

251

00:04:53,250  -->  00:04:53,260

252

00:04:53,260  -->  00:04:56,490
away see that it's not aggregated these

253

00:04:56,490  -->  00:04:56,500

254

00:04:56,500  -->  00:04:59,160
measures are not aggregated and so there

255

00:04:59,160  -->  00:04:59,170

256

00:04:59,170  -->  00:05:01,920
we go the visualization is practically

257

00:05:01,920  -->  00:05:01,930

258

00:05:01,930  -->  00:05:02,610
ready.

259

00:05:02,610  -->  00:05:02,620

260

00:05:02,620  -->  00:05:05,820
It literally took us under 5 or 6

261

00:05:05,820  -->  00:05:05,830

262

00:05:05,830  -->  00:05:07,920
minutes to create all of that and that's

263

00:05:07,920  -->  00:05:07,930

264

00:05:07,930  -->  00:05:10,770
because we are at that advanced level of

265

00:05:10,770  -->  00:05:10,780

266

00:05:10,780  -->  00:05:12,900
Tableau we understand very very well

267

00:05:12,900  -->  00:05:12,910

268

00:05:12,910  -->  00:05:15,210
exactly what we're doing and that was

269

00:05:15,210  -->  00:05:15,220

270

00:05:15,220  -->  00:05:16,080
very fast.

271

00:05:16,080  -->  00:05:16,090

272

00:05:16,090  -->  00:05:18,210
The last thing that we have to do is add an

273

00:05:18,210  -->  00:05:18,220

274

00:05:18,220  -->  00:05:20,910
animation to this visual and we will do

275

00:05:20,910  -->  00:05:20,920

276

00:05:20,920  -->  00:05:22,530
that in the next tutorial. I look forward

277

00:05:22,530  -->  00:05:22,540

278

00:05:22,540  -->  00:05:24,000
to seeing you next time and until then,

279

00:05:24,000  -->  00:05:24,010

280

00:05:24,010  -->  00:05:30,360
happy analyzing.
