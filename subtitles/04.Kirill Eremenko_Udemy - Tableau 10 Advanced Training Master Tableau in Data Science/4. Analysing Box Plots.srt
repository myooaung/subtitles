00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,710
Welcome back to the advanced course on

2

00:00:06,710  -->  00:00:06,720

3

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:08,810
Tableau. In the previous tutorial we

4

00:00:08,810  -->  00:00:08,820

5

00:00:08,820  -->  00:00:11,030
created these our beautiful four box

6

00:00:11,030  -->  00:00:11,040

7

00:00:11,040  -->  00:00:14,330
plots and today we're going to learn how

8

00:00:14,330  -->  00:00:14,340

9

00:00:14,340  -->  00:00:16,039
to analyze them, we've got quite a lot of

10

00:00:16,039  -->  00:00:16,049

11

00:00:16,049  -->  00:00:17,779
ground to cover so let's jump straight

12

00:00:17,779  -->  00:00:17,789

13

00:00:17,789  -->  00:00:18,859
into it.

14

00:00:18,859  -->  00:00:18,869

15

00:00:18,869  -->  00:00:21,050
First off, I'd like to make sure that

16

00:00:21,050  -->  00:00:21,060

17

00:00:21,060  -->  00:00:23,480
everybody's on the same page and

18

00:00:23,480  -->  00:00:23,490

19

00:00:23,490  -->  00:00:26,570
therefore let's look at how exactly

20

00:00:26,570  -->  00:00:26,580

21

00:00:26,580  -->  00:00:29,750
box plots work. So I'm going to bring up a

22

00:00:29,750  -->  00:00:29,760

23

00:00:29,760  -->  00:00:32,299
slide that I have prepared very excited

24

00:00:32,299  -->  00:00:32,309

25

00:00:32,309  -->  00:00:33,049
about this.

26

00:00:33,049  -->  00:00:33,059

27

00:00:33,059  -->  00:00:35,030
Alright so let's say you have an access,

28

00:00:35,030  -->  00:00:35,040

29

00:00:35,040  -->  00:00:37,010
it can be vertical, horizontal in all

30

00:00:37,010  -->  00:00:37,020

31

00:00:37,020  -->  00:00:39,080
cases vertical so let's stick with that

32

00:00:39,080  -->  00:00:39,090

33

00:00:39,090  -->  00:00:41,479
and you have a certain number of

34

00:00:41,479  -->  00:00:41,489

35

00:00:41,489  -->  00:00:43,760
observations that you can plot on this

36

00:00:43,760  -->  00:00:43,770

37

00:00:43,770  -->  00:00:47,000
axis so there are 10 observations now in

38

00:00:47,000  -->  00:00:47,010

39

00:00:47,010  -->  00:00:49,010
order to create an a box plot what you'd have

40

00:00:49,010  -->  00:00:49,020

41

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:50,959
to do is you have to physically count

42

00:00:50,959  -->  00:00:50,969

43

00:00:50,969  -->  00:00:53,330
the number of observations so 1 2 3 up

44

00:00:53,330  -->  00:00:53,340

45

00:00:53,340  -->  00:00:56,360
to 10 and then take the middle between

46

00:00:56,360  -->  00:00:56,370

47

00:00:56,370  -->  00:00:58,250
them so in our case there's an even

48

00:00:58,250  -->  00:00:58,260

49

00:00:58,260  -->  00:01:00,590
number of observations so there is no

50

00:01:00,590  -->  00:01:00,600

51

00:01:00,600  -->  00:01:03,500
one middle observation. The middle ones

52

00:01:03,500  -->  00:01:03,510

53

00:01:03,510  -->  00:01:05,630
are five and six so we're going to put a

54

00:01:05,630  -->  00:01:05,640

55

00:01:05,640  -->  00:01:08,929
line exactly between fit the fifth and

56

00:01:08,929  -->  00:01:08,939

57

00:01:08,939  -->  00:01:10,670
the sixth observation.

58

00:01:10,670  -->  00:01:10,680

59

00:01:10,680  -->  00:01:12,380
Now what we're going to do is we're

60

00:01:12,380  -->  00:01:12,390

61

00:01:12,390  -->  00:01:15,080
going to do the same thing for the top

62

00:01:15,080  -->  00:01:15,090

63

00:01:15,090  -->  00:01:18,200
five. Here we've counted we have five

64

00:01:18,200  -->  00:01:18,210

65

00:01:18,210  -->  00:01:20,149
observations the middle one is number

66

00:01:20,149  -->  00:01:20,159

67

00:01:20,159  -->  00:01:22,219
three. We put a line through that one,

68

00:01:22,219  -->  00:01:22,229

69

00:01:22,229  -->  00:01:24,050
now let's do the exact same thing for

70

00:01:24,050  -->  00:01:24,060

71

00:01:24,060  -->  00:01:27,289
the bottom half 1,2,3,4,5 this is the middle

72

00:01:27,289  -->  00:01:27,299

73

00:01:27,299  -->  00:01:29,149
one over here so we put a line through

74

00:01:29,149  -->  00:01:29,159

75

00:01:29,159  -->  00:01:31,999
it. Now if we replace these lines with

76

00:01:31,999  -->  00:01:32,009

77

00:01:32,009  -->  00:01:34,819
the box we are slowly starting to create

78

00:01:34,819  -->  00:01:34,829

79

00:01:34,829  -->  00:01:37,249
our box plot now all we have to do is

80

00:01:37,249  -->  00:01:37,259

81

00:01:37,259  -->  00:01:40,340
plot the whiskers so the whisker goes

82

00:01:40,340  -->  00:01:40,350

83

00:01:40,350  -->  00:01:42,140
all the way up to the top one over here

84

00:01:42,140  -->  00:01:42,150

85

00:01:42,150  -->  00:01:44,179
and the other whisker goes all the way

86

00:01:44,179  -->  00:01:44,189

87

00:01:44,189  -->  00:01:46,880
up to the bottom one here and elements

88

00:01:46,880  -->  00:01:46,890

89

00:01:46,890  -->  00:01:49,160
of the books plug have their own names.

90

00:01:49,160  -->  00:01:49,170

91

00:01:49,170  -->  00:01:51,200
This is the minimum. This is the first

92

00:01:51,200  -->  00:01:51,210

93

00:01:51,210  -->  00:01:53,899
quartile or the lower quartile. This is

94

00:01:53,899  -->  00:01:53,909

95

00:01:53,909  -->  00:01:56,810
the median. This is the upper quartile,

96

00:01:56,810  -->  00:01:56,820

97

00:01:56,820  -->  00:01:58,880
the third quartile and this is the

98

00:01:58,880  -->  00:01:58,890

99

00:01:58,890  -->  00:02:01,130
maximum and just make sure you don't get

100

00:02:01,130  -->  00:02:01,140

101

00:02:01,140  -->  00:02:03,050
confused here this is not the mean. This

102

00:02:03,050  -->  00:02:03,060

103

00:02:03,060  -->  00:02:05,539
is the median and that's because of the

104

00:02:05,539  -->  00:02:05,549

105

00:02:05,549  -->  00:02:08,449
way we've constructed, so that is how a

106

00:02:08,449  -->  00:02:08,459

107

00:02:08,459  -->  00:02:11,510
box plot gets built so basically it's

108

00:02:11,510  -->  00:02:11,520

109

00:02:11,520  -->  00:02:13,460
about counting the number of records and

110

00:02:13,460  -->  00:02:13,470

111

00:02:13,470  -->  00:02:16,250
breaking it up into four quartile. So

112

00:02:16,250  -->  00:02:16,260

113

00:02:16,260  -->  00:02:19,220
every single quartile has an equal

114

00:02:19,220  -->  00:02:19,230

115

00:02:19,230  -->  00:02:22,130
number of records in it. Now let's look

116

00:02:22,130  -->  00:02:22,140

117

00:02:22,140  -->  00:02:24,140
at another example. Here we've got another

118

00:02:24,140  -->  00:02:24,150

119

00:02:24,150  -->  00:02:28,130
axis. We've got our observations and

120

00:02:28,130  -->  00:02:28,140

121

00:02:28,140  -->  00:02:29,660
let's do the same thing so that's our

122

00:02:29,660  -->  00:02:29,670

123

00:02:29,670  -->  00:02:32,090
median that is going to be our first

124

00:02:32,090  -->  00:02:32,100

125

00:02:32,100  -->  00:02:35,630
quartile that is our third quartile now

126

00:02:35,630  -->  00:02:35,640

127

00:02:35,640  -->  00:02:38,390
for connecting that's our box and now

128

00:02:38,390  -->  00:02:38,400

129

00:02:38,400  -->  00:02:40,850
what we can do here is if we measure the

130

00:02:40,850  -->  00:02:40,860

131

00:02:40,860  -->  00:02:42,890
distance between the third quartile and

132

00:02:42,890  -->  00:02:42,900

133

00:02:42,900  -->  00:02:44,180
the first quartile it's called the

134

00:02:44,180  -->  00:02:44,190

135

00:02:44,190  -->  00:02:45,949
interquartile range.

136

00:02:45,949  -->  00:02:45,959

137

00:02:45,959  -->  00:02:47,780
Well the way we can start box plots is we

138

00:02:47,780  -->  00:02:47,790

139

00:02:47,790  -->  00:02:50,690
want to make sure that our analysis is

140

00:02:50,690  -->  00:02:50,700

141

00:02:50,700  -->  00:02:52,010
not affected by outliers.

142

00:02:52,010  -->  00:02:52,020

143

00:02:52,020  -->  00:02:54,890
So if any observation falls too far away

144

00:02:54,890  -->  00:02:54,900

145

00:02:54,900  -->  00:02:57,199
then we want to exclude from the

146

00:02:57,199  -->  00:02:57,209

147

00:02:57,209  -->  00:02:59,000
construction of the box plot and how do

148

00:02:59,000  -->  00:02:59,010

149

00:02:59,010  -->  00:03:00,949
we determine if and observations too far

150

00:03:00,949  -->  00:03:00,959

151

00:03:00,959  -->  00:03:01,280
away?

152

00:03:01,280  -->  00:03:01,290

153

00:03:01,290  -->  00:03:03,350
Well you need to take one and a half

154

00:03:03,350  -->  00:03:03,360

155

00:03:03,360  -->  00:03:07,040
times the interquartile range and that

156

00:03:07,040  -->  00:03:07,050

157

00:03:07,050  -->  00:03:08,660
is going to be a cut-off point. So if an

158

00:03:08,660  -->  00:03:08,670

159

00:03:08,670  -->  00:03:11,060
observation falls further than that then

160

00:03:11,060  -->  00:03:11,070

161

00:03:11,070  -->  00:03:13,070
you shouldn't included in the box plot

162

00:03:13,070  -->  00:03:13,080

163

00:03:13,080  -->  00:03:15,710
and it's considered an outlier so in

164

00:03:15,710  -->  00:03:15,720

165

00:03:15,720  -->  00:03:17,390
this case our box plot is going to look

166

00:03:17,390  -->  00:03:17,400

167

00:03:17,400  -->  00:03:20,390
like this and that separate dot out there

168

00:03:20,390  -->  00:03:20,400

169

00:03:20,400  -->  00:03:22,400
is considered to be an outlier.

170

00:03:22,400  -->  00:03:22,410

171

00:03:22,410  -->  00:03:24,110
Alright so that's how box plots are

172

00:03:24,110  -->  00:03:24,120

173

00:03:24,120  -->  00:03:26,420
constructed, now let's have a look at a

174

00:03:26,420  -->  00:03:26,430

175

00:03:26,430  -->  00:03:29,660
few sample use cases of box plots. So

176

00:03:29,660  -->  00:03:29,670

177

00:03:29,670  -->  00:03:31,729
here I've got a horizontal axis and for

178

00:03:31,729  -->  00:03:31,739

179

00:03:31,739  -->  00:03:32,900
a change going to be looking at

180

00:03:32,900  -->  00:03:32,910

181

00:03:32,910  -->  00:03:35,210
horizontal box plots and to make things

182

00:03:35,210  -->  00:03:35,220

183

00:03:35,220  -->  00:03:35,990
interesting

184

00:03:35,990  -->  00:03:36,000

185

00:03:36,000  -->  00:03:38,390
let's say we're analyzing sales

186

00:03:38,390  -->  00:03:38,400

187

00:03:38,400  -->  00:03:41,690
representatives and their daily sales so

188

00:03:41,690  -->  00:03:41,700

189

00:03:41,700  -->  00:03:42,770
what would you rather? Would you rather

190

00:03:42,770  -->  00:03:42,780

191

00:03:42,780  -->  00:03:46,250
have your observations plotted like this?

192

00:03:46,250  -->  00:03:46,260

193

00:03:46,260  -->  00:03:47,509
Or would you rather have your

194

00:03:47,509  -->  00:03:47,519

195

00:03:47,519  -->  00:03:49,610
observations plot like this? In both

196

00:03:49,610  -->  00:03:49,620

197

00:03:49,620  -->  00:03:52,009
cases, the median is the same it is a

198

00:03:52,009  -->  00:03:52,019

199

00:03:52,019  -->  00:03:55,039
thousand dollars. Now this is where we

200

00:03:55,039  -->  00:03:55,049

201

00:03:55,049  -->  00:03:57,800
can look at a box plot and if we create

202

00:03:57,800  -->  00:03:57,810

203

00:03:57,810  -->  00:04:00,620
the boxplot for the first example you'll

204

00:04:00,620  -->  00:04:00,630

205

00:04:00,630  -->  00:04:02,570
see that it is quite compact like that.

206

00:04:02,570  -->  00:04:02,580

207

00:04:02,580  -->  00:04:07,160
The second box plot is much more wider,

208

00:04:07,160  -->  00:04:07,170

209

00:04:07,170  -->  00:04:09,620
so what does that tell us? That tells us

210

00:04:09,620  -->  00:04:09,630

211

00:04:09,630  -->  00:04:13,070
that the variance in the first box plot

212

00:04:13,070  -->  00:04:13,080

213

00:04:13,080  -->  00:04:16,219
is lower. So you have a more chances of

214

00:04:16,219  -->  00:04:16,229

215

00:04:16,229  -->  00:04:18,440
being closer to the median, you can only

216

00:04:18,440  -->  00:04:18,450

217

00:04:18,450  -->  00:04:20,690
from the observation that we have you

218

00:04:20,690  -->  00:04:20,700

219

00:04:20,700  -->  00:04:22,460
are only going to be somewhere between

220

00:04:22,460  -->  00:04:22,470

221

00:04:22,470  -->  00:04:25,490
these two whiskers and more likely you

222

00:04:25,490  -->  00:04:25,500

223

00:04:25,500  -->  00:04:26,840
actually going to be inside

224

00:04:26,840  -->  00:04:26,850

225

00:04:26,850  -->  00:04:29,780
the second and third quartiles groups

226

00:04:29,780  -->  00:04:29,790

227

00:04:29,790  -->  00:04:32,540
and therefore you're more likely to be

228

00:04:32,540  -->  00:04:32,550

229

00:04:32,550  -->  00:04:34,970
next to the median here. You have more

230

00:04:34,970  -->  00:04:34,980

231

00:04:34,980  -->  00:04:37,160
room to go up but you also have more

232

00:04:37,160  -->  00:04:37,170

233

00:04:37,170  -->  00:04:38,840
room to go down, so that basically means

234

00:04:38,840  -->  00:04:38,850

235

00:04:38,850  -->  00:04:41,480
that the risk is higher or the

236

00:04:41,480  -->  00:04:41,490

237

00:04:41,490  -->  00:04:44,930
volatility is higher and your sales reps

238

00:04:44,930  -->  00:04:44,940

239

00:04:44,940  -->  00:04:48,200
can bring, they do bring a median back

240

00:04:48,200  -->  00:04:48,210

241

00:04:48,210  -->  00:04:50,120
over a thousand dollars that's a per day

242

00:04:50,120  -->  00:04:50,130

243

00:04:50,130  -->  00:04:52,670
but at the same time it can it can

244

00:04:52,670  -->  00:04:52,680

245

00:04:52,680  -->  00:04:55,640
really vary. It can be anywhere on the

246

00:04:55,640  -->  00:04:55,650

247

00:04:55,650  -->  00:04:57,860
right, anywhere on the left, so you have

248

00:04:57,860  -->  00:04:57,870

249

00:04:57,870  -->  00:05:00,530
more certainty with a more compact box plot,

250

00:05:00,530  -->  00:05:00,540

251

00:05:00,540  -->  00:05:03,920
you have less certainty with a wider

252

00:05:03,920  -->  00:05:03,930

253

00:05:03,930  -->  00:05:07,160
boxplot even given the same median and

254

00:05:07,160  -->  00:05:07,170

255

00:05:07,170  -->  00:05:10,130
the way to think about it or another way

256

00:05:10,130  -->  00:05:10,140

257

00:05:10,140  -->  00:05:11,870
to think about it is in terms of

258

00:05:11,870  -->  00:05:11,880

259

00:05:11,880  -->  00:05:13,910
distribution so this distribution is

260

00:05:13,910  -->  00:05:13,920

261

00:05:13,920  -->  00:05:16,520
narrower this distribution is wider so

262

00:05:16,520  -->  00:05:16,530

263

00:05:16,530  -->  00:05:18,470
if we talk in terms of standard

264

00:05:18,470  -->  00:05:18,480

265

00:05:18,480  -->  00:05:21,320
deviations, standard deviation is here is

266

00:05:21,320  -->  00:05:21,330

267

00:05:21,330  -->  00:05:23,180
all which is also measure of variance

268

00:05:23,180  -->  00:05:23,190

269

00:05:23,190  -->  00:05:25,850
right? So here the standard deviation is

270

00:05:25,850  -->  00:05:25,860

271

00:05:25,860  -->  00:05:28,850
higher or larger, here it's smaller so

272

00:05:28,850  -->  00:05:28,860

273

00:05:28,860  -->  00:05:30,950
you have a more narrow distribution and

274

00:05:30,950  -->  00:05:30,960

275

00:05:30,960  -->  00:05:32,810
you're more likely to actually hit the

276

00:05:32,810  -->  00:05:32,820

277

00:05:32,820  -->  00:05:35,180
nail on the head here whereas here you

278

00:05:35,180  -->  00:05:35,190

279

00:05:35,190  -->  00:05:36,770
can either go left or right which is

280

00:05:36,770  -->  00:05:36,780

281

00:05:36,780  -->  00:05:38,300
more uncertain.

282

00:05:38,300  -->  00:05:38,310

283

00:05:38,310  -->  00:05:40,400
Ok let's have a look at another example,

284

00:05:40,400  -->  00:05:40,410

285

00:05:40,410  -->  00:05:42,950
can you tell me right away what do you

286

00:05:42,950  -->  00:05:42,960

287

00:05:42,960  -->  00:05:45,590
think is this a good box plot or bad box

288

00:05:45,590  -->  00:05:45,600

289

00:05:45,600  -->  00:05:46,160
plot.

290

00:05:46,160  -->  00:05:46,170

291

00:05:46,170  -->  00:05:48,080
Let's say we're also measuring sales and

292

00:05:48,080  -->  00:05:48,090

293

00:05:48,090  -->  00:05:51,260
now its vertical axis and of course

294

00:05:51,260  -->  00:05:51,270

295

00:05:51,270  -->  00:05:52,340
would be better for your great work

296

00:05:52,340  -->  00:05:52,350

297

00:05:52,350  -->  00:05:55,070
compactor like this but is this a good

298

00:05:55,070  -->  00:05:55,080

299

00:05:55,080  -->  00:05:58,430
box plot or a bad box plot and given

300

00:05:58,430  -->  00:05:58,440

301

00:05:58,440  -->  00:06:00,620
that the minimum and the maximum are

302

00:06:00,620  -->  00:06:00,630

303

00:06:00,630  -->  00:06:03,260
fixed and in essence the question we are

304

00:06:03,260  -->  00:06:03,270

305

00:06:03,270  -->  00:06:06,290
asking is is this box plot better than

306

00:06:06,290  -->  00:06:06,300

307

00:06:06,300  -->  00:06:08,630
this box plot and if you think of it in

308

00:06:08,630  -->  00:06:08,640

309

00:06:08,640  -->  00:06:10,310
terms of median the median here is

310

00:06:10,310  -->  00:06:10,320

311

00:06:10,320  -->  00:06:12,950
higher than the median here and it makes

312

00:06:12,950  -->  00:06:12,960

313

00:06:12,960  -->  00:06:14,900
sounds obvious of course this box plot

314

00:06:14,900  -->  00:06:14,910

315

00:06:14,910  -->  00:06:17,180
is preferable to this box plot, so

316

00:06:17,180  -->  00:06:17,190

317

00:06:17,190  -->  00:06:19,580
basically if if your media minimum and

318

00:06:19,580  -->  00:06:19,590

319

00:06:19,590  -->  00:06:21,980
maximum fixed you want your box the part

320

00:06:21,980  -->  00:06:21,990

321

00:06:21,990  -->  00:06:23,750
of the box part of the box but you want

322

00:06:23,750  -->  00:06:23,760

323

00:06:23,760  -->  00:06:27,860
to be as a higher or as closer as more

324

00:06:27,860  -->  00:06:27,870

325

00:06:27,870  -->  00:06:32,420
closer to your desired result of the as

326

00:06:32,420  -->  00:06:32,430

327

00:06:32,430  -->  00:06:34,070
possible so here we're talking about

328

00:06:34,070  -->  00:06:34,080

329

00:06:34,080  -->  00:06:36,710
sales so the larger sales or higher

330

00:06:36,710  -->  00:06:36,720

331

00:06:36,720  -->  00:06:38,810
sales are better, so we want the box to

332

00:06:38,810  -->  00:06:38,820

333

00:06:38,820  -->  00:06:39,530
be higher

334

00:06:39,530  -->  00:06:39,540

335

00:06:39,540  -->  00:06:42,350
not lower but that is the obvious answer.

336

00:06:42,350  -->  00:06:42,360

337

00:06:42,360  -->  00:06:45,410
How do how do we think of it in terms of

338

00:06:45,410  -->  00:06:45,420

339

00:06:45,420  -->  00:06:47,780
distributions and how do we think of it

340

00:06:47,780  -->  00:06:47,790

341

00:06:47,790  -->  00:06:50,510
exactly why this is the case, so if we

342

00:06:50,510  -->  00:06:50,520

343

00:06:50,520  -->  00:06:52,340
plot them out sideways so this is the

344

00:06:52,340  -->  00:06:52,350

345

00:06:52,350  -->  00:06:55,460
good box plot. This is the bad box plot.

346

00:06:55,460  -->  00:06:55,470

347

00:06:55,470  -->  00:06:59,150
Let's plot the observations that make

348

00:06:59,150  -->  00:06:59,160

349

00:06:59,160  -->  00:07:01,490
these boxplots happen, so this these are

350

00:07:01,490  -->  00:07:01,500

351

00:07:01,500  -->  00:07:03,320
10 observations in this case and these

352

00:07:03,320  -->  00:07:03,330

353

00:07:03,330  -->  00:07:05,630
are 10 observations in this case. How

354

00:07:05,630  -->  00:07:05,640

355

00:07:05,640  -->  00:07:07,700
do we see them in terms of distributions?

356

00:07:07,700  -->  00:07:07,710

357

00:07:07,710  -->  00:07:10,910
And for me personally this is the part

358

00:07:10,910  -->  00:07:10,920

359

00:07:10,920  -->  00:07:12,320
that drives this point home.

360

00:07:12,320  -->  00:07:12,330

361

00:07:12,330  -->  00:07:14,510
This is what makes things click, so I'm

362

00:07:14,510  -->  00:07:14,520

363

00:07:14,520  -->  00:07:17,390
going to plot the distribution here and

364

00:07:17,390  -->  00:07:17,400

365

00:07:17,400  -->  00:07:21,260
this here you can see that this is a

366

00:07:21,260  -->  00:07:21,270

367

00:07:21,270  -->  00:07:23,480
right skewed distribution and by the way

368

00:07:23,480  -->  00:07:23,490

369

00:07:23,490  -->  00:07:26,570
right skewed is because the tails on the

370

00:07:26,570  -->  00:07:26,580

371

00:07:26,580  -->  00:07:28,460
right not we don't look at the hump we

372

00:07:28,460  -->  00:07:28,470

373

00:07:28,470  -->  00:07:30,170
look at the tail with the tail is and

374

00:07:30,170  -->  00:07:30,180

375

00:07:30,180  -->  00:07:33,950
that is how we is to define whether it's

376

00:07:33,950  -->  00:07:33,960

377

00:07:33,960  -->  00:07:36,050
a right skewed or left skewed distribution.

378

00:07:36,050  -->  00:07:36,060

379

00:07:36,060  -->  00:07:39,500
So this is a right skewed distribution and if

380

00:07:39,500  -->  00:07:39,510

381

00:07:39,510  -->  00:07:42,050
you think of it in this sense, what it's

382

00:07:42,050  -->  00:07:42,060

383

00:07:42,060  -->  00:07:45,080
telling us is that if you throw a random

384

00:07:45,080  -->  00:07:45,090

385

00:07:45,090  -->  00:07:48,200
observation another one observation on

386

00:07:48,200  -->  00:07:48,210

387

00:07:48,210  -->  00:07:50,900
to this chart then it is more likely to

388

00:07:50,900  -->  00:07:50,910

389

00:07:50,910  -->  00:07:53,480
end up in this area in this more dense

390

00:07:53,480  -->  00:07:53,490

391

00:07:53,490  -->  00:07:56,090
area than it is on in this tale part

392

00:07:56,090  -->  00:07:56,100

393

00:07:56,100  -->  00:07:58,190
right because uh that's how

394

00:07:58,190  -->  00:07:58,200

395

00:07:58,200  -->  00:07:59,960
distributions work. There are more

396

00:07:59,960  -->  00:07:59,970

397

00:07:59,970  -->  00:08:02,540
observations here, so you got your mean

398

00:08:02,540  -->  00:08:02,550

399

00:08:02,550  -->  00:08:04,580
median mode in in this part of the chart

400

00:08:04,580  -->  00:08:04,590

401

00:08:04,590  -->  00:08:05,870
not in this part of the chart so you

402

00:08:05,870  -->  00:08:05,880

403

00:08:05,880  -->  00:08:08,840
throw a random variable here. It is more

404

00:08:08,840  -->  00:08:08,850

405

00:08:08,850  -->  00:08:11,900
likely to end up here and here on

406

00:08:11,900  -->  00:08:11,910

407

00:08:11,910  -->  00:08:15,890
this other side if you throw a random

408

00:08:15,890  -->  00:08:15,900

409

00:08:15,900  -->  00:08:18,710
variable into this environment into this

410

00:08:18,710  -->  00:08:18,720

411

00:08:18,720  -->  00:08:21,350
example then what will happen is it more

412

00:08:21,350  -->  00:08:21,360

413

00:08:21,360  -->  00:08:24,290
likely end up on the right side so this

414

00:08:24,290  -->  00:08:24,300

415

00:08:24,300  -->  00:08:25,940
is a left skewed distribution the tails

416

00:08:25,940  -->  00:08:25,950

417

00:08:25,950  -->  00:08:28,100
on the left but most of the observations

418

00:08:28,100  -->  00:08:28,110

419

00:08:28,110  -->  00:08:30,410
are concentrated over here so if you

420

00:08:30,410  -->  00:08:30,420

421

00:08:30,420  -->  00:08:32,510
throw another random variable it will

422

00:08:32,510  -->  00:08:32,520

423

00:08:32,520  -->  00:08:34,820
most likely end up here and which is

424

00:08:34,820  -->  00:08:34,830

425

00:08:34,830  -->  00:08:36,560
good for us because the sales higher. So

426

00:08:36,560  -->  00:08:36,570

427

00:08:36,570  -->  00:08:41,780
that is how I personally think of box

428

00:08:41,780  -->  00:08:41,790

429

00:08:41,790  -->  00:08:45,320
plots sometimes because you know like

430

00:08:45,320  -->  00:08:45,330

431

00:08:45,330  -->  00:08:47,210
distributions we're used to them and

432

00:08:47,210  -->  00:08:47,220

433

00:08:47,220  -->  00:08:49,970
they've got a lot of mathematics behind

434

00:08:49,970  -->  00:08:49,980

435

00:08:49,980  -->  00:08:50,940
them.

436

00:08:50,940  -->  00:08:50,950

437

00:08:50,950  -->  00:08:52,740
They got standard deviations things like that.

438

00:08:52,740  -->  00:08:52,750

439

00:08:52,750  -->  00:08:54,480
Box plots are also also great but

440

00:08:54,480  -->  00:08:54,490

441

00:08:54,490  -->  00:08:57,870
they're simpler things I think and when

442

00:08:57,870  -->  00:08:57,880

443

00:08:57,880  -->  00:08:59,370
you think of them in terms of distributions

444

00:08:59,370  -->  00:08:59,380

445

00:08:59,380  -->  00:09:01,620
it makes a lot of sense that why a box

446

00:09:01,620  -->  00:09:01,630

447

00:09:01,630  -->  00:09:04,710
plot which is which looks like this is

448

00:09:04,710  -->  00:09:04,720

449

00:09:04,720  -->  00:09:07,140
worse if you want to be on the right of

450

00:09:07,140  -->  00:09:07,150

451

00:09:07,150  -->  00:09:08,790
axis than a box plot that looks like

452

00:09:08,790  -->  00:09:08,800

453

00:09:08,800  -->  00:09:09,660
that.

454

00:09:09,660  -->  00:09:09,670

455

00:09:09,670  -->  00:09:13,410
Ok so that is how box plots work, let's go

456

00:09:13,410  -->  00:09:13,420

457

00:09:13,420  -->  00:09:15,990
jump back into Tableau and see what

458

00:09:15,990  -->  00:09:16,000

459

00:09:16,000  -->  00:09:18,390
analysis we can drive from there.

460

00:09:18,390  -->  00:09:18,400

461

00:09:18,400  -->  00:09:20,430
Alright so there's our chart, what can we

462

00:09:20,430  -->  00:09:20,440

463

00:09:20,440  -->  00:09:22,290
see from this chart knowing that

464

00:09:22,290  -->  00:09:22,300

465

00:09:22,300  -->  00:09:23,970
everything we know now?

466

00:09:23,970  -->  00:09:23,980

467

00:09:23,980  -->  00:09:26,250
Well right away we can see outliers here

468

00:09:26,250  -->  00:09:26,260

469

00:09:26,260  -->  00:09:28,800
and here so what this means is that in

470

00:09:28,800  -->  00:09:28,810

471

00:09:28,810  -->  00:09:30,240
these three states in New South Wales,

472

00:09:30,240  -->  00:09:30,250

473

00:09:30,250  -->  00:09:33,030
Queensland and Victoria. They are companies

474

00:09:33,030  -->  00:09:33,040

475

00:09:33,040  -->  00:09:35,550
that are underperforming in terms of the

476

00:09:35,550  -->  00:09:35,560

477

00:09:35,560  -->  00:09:37,560
overall performance in that specific

478

00:09:37,560  -->  00:09:37,570

479

00:09:37,570  -->  00:09:40,200
state. Then in Queensland there are companies

480

00:09:40,200  -->  00:09:40,210

481

00:09:40,210  -->  00:09:42,360
that are over performing. Also if you put

482

00:09:42,360  -->  00:09:42,370

483

00:09:42,370  -->  00:09:43,920
your mouse over the box plot, you will

484

00:09:43,920  -->  00:09:43,930

485

00:09:43,930  -->  00:09:45,870
get some information which directly

486

00:09:45,870  -->  00:09:45,880

487

00:09:45,880  -->  00:09:48,660
relates to the five points that we

488

00:09:48,660  -->  00:09:48,670

489

00:09:48,670  -->  00:09:51,210
discussed about boxplots so the minimum

490

00:09:51,210  -->  00:09:51,220

491

00:09:51,220  -->  00:09:53,610
the lower quartile the medium the upper

492

00:09:53,610  -->  00:09:53,620

493

00:09:53,620  -->  00:09:58,530
quartile and the maximum and if you use

494

00:09:58,530  -->  00:09:58,540

495

00:09:58,540  -->  00:10:00,690
this information you can compare the box

496

00:10:00,690  -->  00:10:00,700

497

00:10:00,700  -->  00:10:02,340
plots among each other and for instance

498

00:10:02,340  -->  00:10:02,350

499

00:10:02,350  -->  00:10:04,080
we can say that this box plot has the

500

00:10:04,080  -->  00:10:04,090

501

00:10:04,090  -->  00:10:06,060
highest median which is eight percent.

502

00:10:06,060  -->  00:10:06,070

503

00:10:06,070  -->  00:10:07,890
This one is also eight percentage, you can

504

00:10:07,890  -->  00:10:07,900

505

00:10:07,900  -->  00:10:09,750
visually see that see that it's lower

506

00:10:09,750  -->  00:10:09,760

507

00:10:09,760  -->  00:10:13,200
than this box plot comes in a third so

508

00:10:13,200  -->  00:10:13,210

509

00:10:13,210  -->  00:10:15,630
this state has a third median which is

510

00:10:15,630  -->  00:10:15,640

511

00:10:15,640  -->  00:10:17,760
six percent and this one has a four

512

00:10:17,760  -->  00:10:17,770

513

00:10:17,770  -->  00:10:21,750
percent and finally let's talk about the

514

00:10:21,750  -->  00:10:21,760

515

00:10:21,760  -->  00:10:24,690
variance and the sizes of the box plots.

516

00:10:24,690  -->  00:10:24,700

517

00:10:24,700  -->  00:10:26,700
You can see that this box plot here and

518

00:10:26,700  -->  00:10:26,710

519

00:10:26,710  -->  00:10:29,520
this box plot here they are pretty big

520

00:10:29,520  -->  00:10:29,530

521

00:10:29,530  -->  00:10:31,650
compared to these two box plots and

522

00:10:31,650  -->  00:10:31,660

523

00:10:31,660  -->  00:10:33,000
that means that the variance here is

524

00:10:33,000  -->  00:10:33,010

525

00:10:33,010  -->  00:10:35,910
much greater so there's less certainty

526

00:10:35,910  -->  00:10:35,920

527

00:10:35,920  -->  00:10:38,610
that the like a random company thrown

528

00:10:38,610  -->  00:10:38,620

529

00:10:38,620  -->  00:10:41,160
into this one of these states will be

530

00:10:41,160  -->  00:10:41,170

531

00:10:41,170  -->  00:10:43,980
performing at the median net profit

532

00:10:43,980  -->  00:10:43,990

533

00:10:43,990  -->  00:10:45,570
margin and bear in mind when we say

534

00:10:45,570  -->  00:10:45,580

535

00:10:45,580  -->  00:10:48,060
random company we're not taking into

536

00:10:48,060  -->  00:10:48,070

537

00:10:48,070  -->  00:10:50,010
account all the amazing things about our

538

00:10:50,010  -->  00:10:50,020

539

00:10:50,020  -->  00:10:51,450
specific company. We're not taking into

540

00:10:51,450  -->  00:10:51,460

541

00:10:51,460  -->  00:10:54,390
account the product differentiation that

542

00:10:54,390  -->  00:10:54,400

543

00:10:54,400  -->  00:10:56,370
we can offer the amazing customer

544

00:10:56,370  -->  00:10:56,380

545

00:10:56,380  -->  00:10:58,590
service that we deliver and all those

546

00:10:58,590  -->  00:10:58,600

547

00:10:58,600  -->  00:11:00,480
great things. We're just saying if we

548

00:11:00,480  -->  00:11:00,490

549

00:11:00,490  -->  00:11:03,079
throw in a random company that

550

00:11:03,079  -->  00:11:03,089

551

00:11:03,089  -->  00:11:07,040
performs comparability to the companies

552

00:11:07,040  -->  00:11:07,050

553

00:11:07,050  -->  00:11:09,079
in that specific state and you know it's

554

00:11:09,079  -->  00:11:09,089

555

00:11:09,089  -->  00:11:10,910
working its performing about some around

556

00:11:10,910  -->  00:11:10,920

557

00:11:10,920  -->  00:11:13,610
average with sort of certain level

558

00:11:13,610  -->  00:11:13,620

559

00:11:13,620  -->  00:11:16,579
variants where will it end up? So it is

560

00:11:16,579  -->  00:11:16,589

561

00:11:16,589  -->  00:11:18,619
likely to end up in this box but because

562

00:11:18,619  -->  00:11:18,629

563

00:11:18,629  -->  00:11:21,170
the box is so big there is more

564

00:11:21,170  -->  00:11:21,180

565

00:11:21,180  -->  00:11:24,739
uncertainty as to where it will be

566

00:11:24,739  -->  00:11:24,749

567

00:11:24,749  -->  00:11:26,989
performing in this specific state. So

568

00:11:26,989  -->  00:11:26,999

569

00:11:26,999  -->  00:11:28,939
basically we're kind of assessing the

570

00:11:28,939  -->  00:11:28,949

571

00:11:28,949  -->  00:11:30,829
business environment in each of these

572

00:11:30,829  -->  00:11:30,839

573

00:11:30,839  -->  00:11:33,139
states, if in Western Australia once

574

00:11:33,139  -->  00:11:33,149

575

00:11:33,149  -->  00:11:34,850
again there is more uncertainty where

576

00:11:34,850  -->  00:11:34,860

577

00:11:34,860  -->  00:11:37,040
your company will end up in terms of net

578

00:11:37,040  -->  00:11:37,050

579

00:11:37,050  -->  00:11:38,989
profit margin because the box plot is quite

580

00:11:38,989  -->  00:11:38,999

581

00:11:38,999  -->  00:11:41,780
large. Here the box plots are smaller and

582

00:11:41,780  -->  00:11:41,790

583

00:11:41,790  -->  00:11:43,160
as you remember what we just discussed

584

00:11:43,160  -->  00:11:43,170

585

00:11:43,170  -->  00:11:45,410
which one is better?

586

00:11:45,410  -->  00:11:45,420

587

00:11:45,420  -->  00:11:46,850
Let's say here would you rather have

588

00:11:46,850  -->  00:11:46,860

589

00:11:46,860  -->  00:11:48,619
this box here? Would you have it up at

590

00:11:48,619  -->  00:11:48,629

591

00:11:48,629  -->  00:11:50,660
the top? You would rather have it up the

592

00:11:50,660  -->  00:11:50,670

593

00:11:50,670  -->  00:11:52,699
top because a higher profit, profit

594

00:11:52,699  -->  00:11:52,709

595

00:11:52,709  -->  00:11:55,100
margin is better for us. So this is not

596

00:11:55,100  -->  00:11:55,110

597

00:11:55,110  -->  00:11:58,730
the best setup in this specific state,

598

00:11:58,730  -->  00:11:58,740

599

00:11:58,740  -->  00:12:00,019
it could have been better if this box

600

00:12:00,019  -->  00:12:00,029

601

00:12:00,029  -->  00:12:02,389
hadn't had been higher at the top would

602

00:12:02,389  -->  00:12:02,399

603

00:12:02,399  -->  00:12:03,889
have been better on the other hand in

604

00:12:03,889  -->  00:12:03,899

605

00:12:03,899  -->  00:12:05,929
Victoria you can see that the box part

606

00:12:05,929  -->  00:12:05,939

607

00:12:05,939  -->  00:12:07,910
of the box plot is at the top

608

00:12:07,910  -->  00:12:07,920

609

00:12:07,920  -->  00:12:09,829
meaning that the setup in this business

610

00:12:09,829  -->  00:12:09,839

611

00:12:09,839  -->  00:12:12,379
environment is actually pretty good.

612

00:12:12,379  -->  00:12:12,389

613

00:12:12,389  -->  00:12:13,939
You can see that the box plot is quite

614

00:12:13,939  -->  00:12:13,949

615

00:12:13,949  -->  00:12:16,100
compact. Meaning that there is less

616

00:12:16,100  -->  00:12:16,110

617

00:12:16,110  -->  00:12:18,650
uncertainty in terms of where a random

618

00:12:18,650  -->  00:12:18,660

619

00:12:18,660  -->  00:12:20,299
company went end up in terms of net

620

00:12:20,299  -->  00:12:20,309

621

00:12:20,309  -->  00:12:22,910
profit margin and also you can see that

622

00:12:22,910  -->  00:12:22,920

623

00:12:22,920  -->  00:12:25,730
the median well of course the median is

624

00:12:25,730  -->  00:12:25,740

625

00:12:25,740  -->  00:12:27,559
higher than these two other states but

626

00:12:27,559  -->  00:12:27,569

627

00:12:27,569  -->  00:12:29,689
also you can see that the box part of

628

00:12:29,689  -->  00:12:29,699

629

00:12:29,699  -->  00:12:32,660
the box plot is closer to where we want

630

00:12:32,660  -->  00:12:32,670

631

00:12:32,670  -->  00:12:35,090
to be to the top and as we discussed

632

00:12:35,090  -->  00:12:35,100

633

00:12:35,100  -->  00:12:36,980
that's a good thing. It's better than if

634

00:12:36,980  -->  00:12:36,990

635

00:12:36,990  -->  00:12:39,619
this box part was lower,

636

00:12:39,619  -->  00:12:39,629

637

00:12:39,629  -->  00:12:41,569
so there we go that's how you analyze

638

00:12:41,569  -->  00:12:41,579

639

00:12:41,579  -->  00:12:43,460
box plots and what can we conclude from

640

00:12:43,460  -->  00:12:43,470

641

00:12:43,470  -->  00:12:45,499
here. Well we can say that out of these

642

00:12:45,499  -->  00:12:45,509

643

00:12:45,509  -->  00:12:47,239
three states and since we already

644

00:12:47,239  -->  00:12:47,249

645

00:12:47,249  -->  00:12:50,509
working in or the businesses operating

646

00:12:50,509  -->  00:12:50,519

647

00:12:50,519  -->  00:12:52,160
yourself well out of these three states

648

00:12:52,160  -->  00:12:52,170

649

00:12:52,170  -->  00:12:55,369
it's obvious that this state Victoria is

650

00:12:55,369  -->  00:12:55,379

651

00:12:55,379  -->  00:12:58,160
the better one in terms of expansion in

652

00:12:58,160  -->  00:12:58,170

653

00:12:58,170  -->  00:13:00,949
terms of business environment and this

654

00:13:00,949  -->  00:13:00,959

655

00:13:00,959  -->  00:13:03,559
analysis has been performed based on

656

00:13:03,559  -->  00:13:03,569

657

00:13:03,569  -->  00:13:06,439
competitor research. Now that's not the

658

00:13:06,439  -->  00:13:06,449

659

00:13:06,449  -->  00:13:08,840
end of our challenge, we of course have

660

00:13:08,840  -->  00:13:08,850

661

00:13:08,850  -->  00:13:12,829
to analyze the economies of these states

662

00:13:12,829  -->  00:13:12,839

663

00:13:12,839  -->  00:13:14,480
we have to analyze how the industries

664

00:13:14,480  -->  00:13:14,490

665

00:13:14,490  -->  00:13:15,140
are performing

666

00:13:15,140  -->  00:13:15,150

667

00:13:15,150  -->  00:13:17,030
and other populations are growing

668

00:13:17,030  -->  00:13:17,040

669

00:13:17,040  -->  00:13:18,590
things like that so we will definitely

670

00:13:18,590  -->  00:13:18,600

671

00:13:18,600  -->  00:13:20,900
get to that. This was like the very first

672

00:13:20,900  -->  00:13:20,910

673

00:13:20,910  -->  00:13:23,240
stage and what we want to do now is we want

674
