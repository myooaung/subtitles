00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.720
Hello and welcome to the advanced course

2

00:00:02.720  -->  00:00:02.730

3

00:00:02.730  -->  00:00:04.940
in Tableau. I'm super excited that you

4

00:00:04.940  -->  00:00:04.950

5

00:00:04.950  -->  00:00:07.070
decided to join. A lot of students who

6

00:00:07.070  -->  00:00:07.080

7

00:00:07.080  -->  00:00:09.410
had completed my basic course on Tableau,

8

00:00:09.410  -->  00:00:09.420

9

00:00:09.420  -->  00:00:11.509
later got in touch to tell me about

10

00:00:11.509  -->  00:00:11.519

11

00:00:11.519  -->  00:00:13.430
their successes and how that course had

12

00:00:13.430  -->  00:00:13.440

13

00:00:13.440  -->  00:00:16.670
helped them get a job or promotion or

14

00:00:16.670  -->  00:00:16.680

15

00:00:16.680  -->  00:00:19.040
pass an interview or an exam and that is

16

00:00:19.040  -->  00:00:19.050

17

00:00:19.050  -->  00:00:20.210
simply amazing.

18

00:00:20.210  -->  00:00:20.220

19

00:00:20.220  -->  00:00:22.849
It is incredibly rewarding to know that

20

00:00:22.849  -->  00:00:22.859

21

00:00:22.859  -->  00:00:24.920
through these courses I can help you

22

00:00:24.920  -->  00:00:24.930

23

00:00:24.930  -->  00:00:27.320
with your careers and that is also the

24

00:00:27.320  -->  00:00:27.330

25

00:00:27.330  -->  00:00:29.120
reason why I have developed this

26

00:00:29.120  -->  00:00:29.130

27

00:00:29.130  -->  00:00:32.209
advanced class. Here we'll be coming off a

28

00:00:32.209  -->  00:00:32.219

29

00:00:32.219  -->  00:00:34.069
few additional topics and we'll be

30

00:00:34.069  -->  00:00:34.079

31

00:00:34.079  -->  00:00:36.709
diving into depth and that will help you

32

00:00:36.709  -->  00:00:36.719

33

00:00:36.719  -->  00:00:39.260
develop that expertise in Tableau which

34

00:00:39.260  -->  00:00:39.270

35

00:00:39.270  -->  00:00:41.780
you have already started growing and

36

00:00:41.780  -->  00:00:41.790

37

00:00:41.790  -->  00:00:44.240
that is a great thing because demand for

38

00:00:44.240  -->  00:00:44.250

39

00:00:44.250  -->  00:00:45.920
Tableau is constantly growing in the

40

00:00:45.920  -->  00:00:45.930

41

00:00:45.930  -->  00:00:48.650
world and it is not currently completely

42

00:00:48.650  -->  00:00:48.660

43

00:00:48.660  -->  00:00:51.170
met so you can meet that demand by

44

00:00:51.170  -->  00:00:51.180

45

00:00:51.180  -->  00:00:53.540
developing these advanced skills. But do

46

00:00:53.540  -->  00:00:53.550

47

00:00:53.550  -->  00:00:55.400
bear in mind that this is an advanced

48

00:00:55.400  -->  00:00:55.410

49

00:00:55.410  -->  00:00:57.709
course and we are discussing more

50

00:00:57.709  -->  00:00:57.719

51

00:00:57.719  -->  00:00:59.720
complex topics. So if you haven't yet

52

00:00:59.720  -->  00:00:59.730

53

00:00:59.730  -->  00:01:01.760
completed my basic course then make sure

54

00:01:01.760  -->  00:01:01.770

55

00:01:01.770  -->  00:01:04.100
to do that first because we will be

56

00:01:04.100  -->  00:01:04.110

57

00:01:04.110  -->  00:01:05.810
building on some of the knowledge that

58

00:01:05.810  -->  00:01:05.820

59

00:01:05.820  -->  00:01:09.830
we develop in that course. And finally

60

00:01:09.830  -->  00:01:09.840

61

00:01:09.840  -->  00:01:11.690
some of the lectures in this course

62

00:01:11.690  -->  00:01:11.700

63

00:01:11.700  -->  00:01:14.120
might seem a bit more complex than what

64

00:01:14.120  -->  00:01:14.130

65

00:01:14.130  -->  00:01:16.850
we're used to but that is because we are

66

00:01:16.850  -->  00:01:16.860

67

00:01:16.860  -->  00:01:19.340
discussing advanced topics. So make sure

68

00:01:19.340  -->  00:01:19.350

69

00:01:19.350  -->  00:01:21.530
to pace yourself and at the end of the

70

00:01:21.530  -->  00:01:21.540

71

00:01:21.540  -->  00:01:24.020
course everything that you do will be a

72

00:01:24.020  -->  00:01:24.030

73

00:01:24.030  -->  00:01:26.420
hundred percent worth the effort and now

74

00:01:26.420  -->  00:01:26.430

75

00:01:26.430  -->  00:01:28.039
let's have a quick overview of the

76

00:01:28.039  -->  00:01:28.049

77

00:01:28.049  -->  00:01:29.330
section of the course so you can

78

00:01:29.330  -->  00:01:29.340

79

00:01:29.340  -->  00:01:31.190
navigate it better.

80

00:01:31.190  -->  00:01:31.200

81

00:01:31.200  -->  00:01:33.260
Welcome to the inside part of the course,

82

00:01:33.260  -->  00:01:33.270

83

00:01:33.270  -->  00:01:35.929
amazing to have you on board and let's

84

00:01:35.929  -->  00:01:35.939

85

00:01:35.939  -->  00:01:38.149
quickly run through the sections that

86

00:01:38.149  -->  00:01:38.159

87

00:01:38.159  -->  00:01:39.319
await you ahead.

88

00:01:39.319  -->  00:01:39.329

89

00:01:39.329  -->  00:01:41.179
Alright, so section one is the

90

00:01:41.179  -->  00:01:41.189

91

00:01:41.189  -->  00:01:43.280
introduction which is this lecture

92

00:01:43.280  -->  00:01:43.290

93

00:01:43.290  -->  00:01:45.800
that we're having right now and then

94

00:01:45.800  -->  00:01:45.810

95

00:01:45.810  -->  00:01:47.600
starting from section 2, we dive straight

96

00:01:47.600  -->  00:01:47.610

97

00:01:47.610  -->  00:01:49.910
into the nitty-gritty and advanced

98

00:01:49.910  -->  00:01:49.920

99

00:01:49.920  -->  00:01:52.580
topics of Tableau. Now the first thing I

100

00:01:52.580  -->  00:01:52.590

101

00:01:52.590  -->  00:01:54.319
should mention is that this course has

102

00:01:54.319  -->  00:01:54.329

103

00:01:54.329  -->  00:01:57.649
four sections. The sections are named

104

00:01:57.649  -->  00:01:57.659

105

00:01:57.659  -->  00:02:00.289
section two groups and sets, section of

106

00:02:00.289  -->  00:02:00.299

107

00:02:00.299  -->  00:02:02.389
three advanced table calculations,

108

00:02:02.389  -->  00:02:02.399

109

00:02:02.399  -->  00:02:05.389
section four advanced data prep plus

110

00:02:05.389  -->  00:02:05.399

111

00:02:05.399  -->  00:02:07.999
analytics and Tableau and section 5

112

00:02:07.999  -->  00:02:08.009

113

00:02:08.009  -->  00:02:10.070
creating animations in Tableau. So those

114

00:02:10.070  -->  00:02:10.080

115

00:02:10.080  -->  00:02:11.540
are the four main sections, we've got the

116

00:02:11.540  -->  00:02:11.550

117

00:02:11.550  -->  00:02:12.530
conclusion at the end.

118

00:02:12.530  -->  00:02:12.540

119

00:02:12.540  -->  00:02:15.440
The main thing that I wanted to mention

120

00:02:15.440  -->  00:02:15.450

121

00:02:15.450  -->  00:02:17.209
is that these sections are completely

122

00:02:17.209  -->  00:02:17.219

123

00:02:17.219  -->  00:02:19.429
independent, so you don't have to take

124

00:02:19.429  -->  00:02:19.439

125

00:02:19.439  -->  00:02:21.890
them in order. If there is a pressing

126

00:02:21.890  -->  00:02:21.900

127

00:02:21.900  -->  00:02:24.229
need for you to for instance learn about

128

00:02:24.229  -->  00:02:24.239

129

00:02:24.239  -->  00:02:25.910
advanced table calculations because you

130

00:02:25.910  -->  00:02:25.920

131

00:02:25.920  -->  00:02:29.330
needed on a job or a project then go for

132

00:02:29.330  -->  00:02:29.340

133

00:02:29.340  -->  00:02:30.949
it. Go and dive straight into this

134

00:02:30.949  -->  00:02:30.959

135

00:02:30.959  -->  00:02:32.960
section and then take the rest of the

136

00:02:32.960  -->  00:02:32.970

137

00:02:32.970  -->  00:02:36.619
sections at your leisure, when you're

138

00:02:36.619  -->  00:02:36.629

139

00:02:36.629  -->  00:02:38.839
ready for them. It doesn't matter in

140

00:02:38.839  -->  00:02:38.849

141

00:02:38.849  -->  00:02:40.190
which order you take them. The sections

142

00:02:40.190  -->  00:02:40.200

143

00:02:40.200  -->  00:02:41.990
are completely independent and that is

144

00:02:41.990  -->  00:02:42.000

145

00:02:42.000  -->  00:02:43.849
because they are quite large section

146

00:02:43.849  -->  00:02:43.859

147

00:02:43.859  -->  00:02:46.220
some of them go up to 2 over 2 hours

148

00:02:46.220  -->  00:02:46.230

149

00:02:46.230  -->  00:02:50.390
long with 13 or 14 tutorials so I

150

00:02:50.390  -->  00:02:50.400

151

00:02:50.400  -->  00:02:51.770
completely understand that will take your

152

00:02:51.770  -->  00:02:51.780

153

00:02:51.780  -->  00:02:54.589
time to go through them. Therefore take

154

00:02:54.589  -->  00:02:54.599

155

00:02:54.599  -->  00:02:57.319
them in any order as you wish

156

00:02:57.319  -->  00:02:57.329

157

00:02:57.329  -->  00:02:59.629
and as maybe you have requirements to

158

00:02:59.629  -->  00:02:59.639

159

00:02:59.639  -->  00:03:00.949
do so and now we're just going to go

160

00:03:00.949  -->  00:03:00.959

161

00:03:00.959  -->  00:03:02.750
through them and I will explain what

162

00:03:02.750  -->  00:03:02.760

163

00:03:02.760  -->  00:03:04.429
we're studying in each of these sections.

164

00:03:04.429  -->  00:03:04.439

165

00:03:04.439  -->  00:03:07.309
So section two, groups and sets

166

00:03:07.309  -->  00:03:07.319

167

00:03:07.319  -->  00:03:09.379
it's um it's a section where we talk

168

00:03:09.379  -->  00:03:09.389

169

00:03:09.389  -->  00:03:11.750
about what groups are and what sets

170

00:03:11.750  -->  00:03:11.760

171

00:03:11.760  -->  00:03:14.539
are in Tableau and I show you how to as

172

00:03:14.539  -->  00:03:14.549

173

00:03:14.549  -->  00:03:16.399
you can see create static sets, dynamics

174

00:03:16.399  -->  00:03:16.409

175

00:03:16.409  -->  00:03:18.619
sets, combined sets. I used sets of

176

00:03:18.619  -->  00:03:18.629

177

00:03:18.629  -->  00:03:20.569
parameters and basically everything

178

00:03:20.569  -->  00:03:20.579

179

00:03:20.579  -->  00:03:24.710
about sets and also we learn everything

180

00:03:24.710  -->  00:03:24.720

181

00:03:24.720  -->  00:03:28.009
about sets on a real example from the

182

00:03:28.009  -->  00:03:28.019

183

00:03:28.019  -->  00:03:30.830
real world we talk about analyzing

184

00:03:30.830  -->  00:03:30.840

185

00:03:30.840  -->  00:03:34.369
startups and helping a venture

186

00:03:34.369  -->  00:03:34.379

187

00:03:34.379  -->  00:03:36.890
capitalist fund assess which startups

188

00:03:36.890  -->  00:03:36.900

189

00:03:36.900  -->  00:03:38.509
and want to invest. So a pretty pretty

190

00:03:38.509  -->  00:03:38.519

191

00:03:38.519  -->  00:03:41.210
cool example it's quite a quick section

192

00:03:41.210  -->  00:03:41.220

193

00:03:41.220  -->  00:03:42.649
so it's not that long as you can see

194

00:03:42.649  -->  00:03:42.659

195

00:03:42.659  -->  00:03:46.009
tutorials aren't on average they aren't

196

00:03:46.009  -->  00:03:46.019

197

00:03:46.019  -->  00:03:48.050
that as long as on average in the whole

198

00:03:48.050  -->  00:03:48.060

199

00:03:48.060  -->  00:03:50.180
of the course. Although, there is a 15

200

00:03:50.180  -->  00:03:50.190

201

00:03:50.190  -->  00:03:52.009
minute tutorial over here so brace

202

00:03:52.009  -->  00:03:52.019

203

00:03:52.019  -->  00:03:54.379
yourself for that but otherwise a very

204

00:03:54.379  -->  00:03:54.389

205

00:03:54.389  -->  00:03:56.929
powerful tool in your arsenal sete

206

00:03:56.929  -->  00:03:56.939

207

00:03:56.939  -->  00:04:00.679
definitely a worthwhile this section to

208

00:04:00.679  -->  00:04:00.689

209

00:04:00.689  -->  00:04:04.280
learn and to take them takeaways on

210

00:04:04.280  -->  00:04:04.290

211

00:04:04.290  -->  00:04:05.030
board.

212

00:04:05.030  -->  00:04:05.040

213

00:04:05.040  -->  00:04:06.949
Alright, so advanced table calculations.

214

00:04:06.949  -->  00:04:06.959

215

00:04:06.959  -->  00:04:09.319
This is one of the biggest sections of

216

00:04:09.319  -->  00:04:09.329

217

00:04:09.329  -->  00:04:11.839
the course. This one or the other one I'm

218

00:04:11.839  -->  00:04:11.849

219

00:04:11.849  -->  00:04:13.189
not sure which one is exactly the

220

00:04:13.189  -->  00:04:13.199

221

00:04:13.199  -->  00:04:15.469
biggest one but this one is one of the

222

00:04:15.469  -->  00:04:15.479

223

00:04:15.479  -->  00:04:17.779
major sections of the course, very

224

00:04:17.779  -->  00:04:17.789

225

00:04:17.789  -->  00:04:20.569
in-depth the tours are very long, very

226

00:04:20.569  -->  00:04:20.579

227

00:04:20.579  -->  00:04:23.060
some of the topics are very complex so

228

00:04:23.060  -->  00:04:23.070

229

00:04:23.070  -->  00:04:25.100
are and I will mention this again in the

230

00:04:25.100  -->  00:04:25.110

231

00:04:25.110  -->  00:04:26.000
intro.

232

00:04:26.000  -->  00:04:26.010

233

00:04:26.010  -->  00:04:28.700
Make sure to brace yourself these or

234

00:04:28.700  -->  00:04:28.710

235

00:04:28.710  -->  00:04:30.860
pace yourself probably I should say. These

236

00:04:30.860  -->  00:04:30.870

237

00:04:30.870  -->  00:04:34.400
topics that we discussed may seem a bit

238

00:04:34.400  -->  00:04:34.410

239

00:04:34.410  -->  00:04:36.380
more complex than usual but they are

240

00:04:36.380  -->  00:04:36.390

241

00:04:36.390  -->  00:04:41.750
definitely very powerful when you come

242

00:04:41.750  -->  00:04:41.760

243

00:04:41.760  -->  00:04:43.430
to the point when you will be needing

244

00:04:43.430  -->  00:04:43.440

245

00:04:43.440  -->  00:04:44.930
and recording them in your work and plus

246

00:04:44.930  -->  00:04:44.940

247

00:04:44.940  -->  00:04:46.550
it will give you that extra flexibility

248

00:04:46.550  -->  00:04:46.560

249

00:04:46.560  -->  00:04:49.490
and this is one of those topics that

250

00:04:49.490  -->  00:04:49.500

251

00:04:49.500  -->  00:04:53.210
takes you that separates a you know

252

00:04:53.210  -->  00:04:53.220

253

00:04:53.220  -->  00:04:55.010
somebody who knows Tableau from somebody

254

00:04:55.010  -->  00:04:55.020

255

00:04:55.020  -->  00:04:58.160
who is advanced in Tableau, so definitely

256

00:04:58.160  -->  00:04:58.170

257

00:04:58.170  -->  00:05:00.770
check out this section as well advanced

258

00:05:00.770  -->  00:05:00.780

259

00:05:00.780  -->  00:05:03.680
table calculations. Next section four, it

260

00:05:03.680  -->  00:05:03.690

261

00:05:03.690  -->  00:05:05.630
is so big. It is

262

00:05:05.630  -->  00:05:05.640

263

00:05:05.640  -->  00:05:07.790
in by the number of tutorials is the

264

00:05:07.790  -->  00:05:07.800

265

00:05:07.800  -->  00:05:10.400
biggest ones got 14 tutorials in here

266

00:05:10.400  -->  00:05:10.410

267

00:05:10.410  -->  00:05:12.200
and it's the biggest one because it's a

268

00:05:12.200  -->  00:05:12.210

269

00:05:12.210  -->  00:05:14.000
combined section. So here we discuss two

270

00:05:14.000  -->  00:05:14.010

271

00:05:14.010  -->  00:05:16.370
topics. We talk about advanced data

272

00:05:16.370  -->  00:05:16.380

273

00:05:16.380  -->  00:05:18.770
preparation and analytics in Tableau. So

274

00:05:18.770  -->  00:05:18.780

275

00:05:18.780  -->  00:05:20.480
in terms of analytics, you will learn

276

00:05:20.480  -->  00:05:20.490

277

00:05:20.490  -->  00:05:24.350
box plots, trend lines and forecasting. So

278

00:05:24.350  -->  00:05:24.360

279

00:05:24.360  -->  00:05:26.150
you've got a box plot, so here you've got

280

00:05:26.150  -->  00:05:26.160

281

00:05:26.160  -->  00:05:28.070
trend lines here and you got forecasting

282

00:05:28.070  -->  00:05:28.080

283

00:05:28.080  -->  00:05:30.290
and in between you will learn advanced

284

00:05:30.290  -->  00:05:30.300

285

00:05:30.300  -->  00:05:31.730
data preparations, so things like pivot

286

00:05:31.730  -->  00:05:31.740

287

00:05:31.740  -->  00:05:35.270
and splits, advanced pivots, advanced

288

00:05:35.270  -->  00:05:35.280

289

00:05:35.280  -->  00:05:38.360
blending so we've got advanced time

290

00:05:38.360  -->  00:05:38.370

291

00:05:38.370  -->  00:05:40.190
series blending here. So quite an

292

00:05:40.190  -->  00:05:40.200

293

00:05:40.200  -->  00:05:43.130
interesting section a very technical and

294

00:05:43.130  -->  00:05:43.140

295

00:05:43.140  -->  00:05:45.710
it, the take.. takeaways from here

296

00:05:45.710  -->  00:05:45.720

297

00:05:45.720  -->  00:05:49.220
you'll be able to apply in a different

298

00:05:49.220  -->  00:05:49.230

299

00:05:49.230  -->  00:05:52.340
scenarios that will help you speed up

300

00:05:52.340  -->  00:05:52.350

301

00:05:52.350  -->  00:05:53.960
your work in Tableau in general

302

00:05:53.960  -->  00:05:53.970

303

00:05:53.970  -->  00:05:55.550
especially when it comes to data

304

00:05:55.550  -->  00:05:55.560

305

00:05:55.560  -->  00:05:57.590
preparation and analytics will help you

306

00:05:57.590  -->  00:05:57.600

307

00:05:57.600  -->  00:05:59.180
do that

308

00:05:59.180  -->  00:05:59.190

309

00:05:59.190  -->  00:06:01.730
ad-hoc analytics side of things that you

310

00:06:01.730  -->  00:06:01.740

311

00:06:01.740  -->  00:06:03.350
can do in Tableau. A lot of people forget

312

00:06:03.350  -->  00:06:03.360

313

00:06:03.360  -->  00:06:05.090
that Tableau is not just a visualization

314

00:06:05.090  -->  00:06:05.100

315

00:06:05.100  -->  00:06:07.490
tool. It also has analytics capability.

316

00:06:07.490  -->  00:06:07.500

317

00:06:07.500  -->  00:06:09.020
Oh by the way, I forgot to mention in

318

00:06:09.020  -->  00:06:09.030

319

00:06:09.030  -->  00:06:11.900
section 3 we've got really really

320

00:06:11.900  -->  00:06:11.910

321

00:06:11.910  -->  00:06:14.270
interesting data set. We're talking about

322

00:06:14.270  -->  00:06:14.280

323

00:06:14.280  -->  00:06:17.450
a call terminal so how a call is

324

00:06:17.450  -->  00:06:17.460

325

00:06:17.460  -->  00:06:19.430
prepared to be shipped after its

326

00:06:19.430  -->  00:06:19.440

327

00:06:19.440  -->  00:06:22.370
celebrate by train so I that is one of

328

00:06:22.370  -->  00:06:22.380

329

00:06:22.380  -->  00:06:27.110
the most fascinating business challenges

330

00:06:27.110  -->  00:06:27.120

331

00:06:27.120  -->  00:06:28.880
I have ever created for my students so

332

00:06:28.880  -->  00:06:28.890

333

00:06:28.890  -->  00:06:31.010
even just for that you should check out

334

00:06:31.010  -->  00:06:31.020

335

00:06:31.020  -->  00:06:33.230
this section. It is pretty incredible got

336

00:06:33.230  -->  00:06:33.240

337

00:06:33.240  -->  00:06:35.150
some good great photos in there in this

338

00:06:35.150  -->  00:06:35.160

339

00:06:35.160  -->  00:06:38.120
project brief. I'm sure you will really

340

00:06:38.120  -->  00:06:38.130

341

00:06:38.130  -->  00:06:39.620
like it and you'll say wow

342

00:06:39.620  -->  00:06:39.630

343

00:06:39.630  -->  00:06:41.750
our by the end of the tutorial and in

344

00:06:41.750  -->  00:06:41.760

345

00:06:41.760  -->  00:06:44.930
here we've got a some statistical data

346

00:06:44.930  -->  00:06:44.940

347

00:06:44.940  -->  00:06:46.610
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics,  so we are

348

00:06:46.610  -->  00:06:46.620

349

00:06:46.620  -->  00:06:48.620
dealing with population trends and we're

350

00:06:48.620  -->  00:06:48.630

351

00:06:48.630  -->  00:06:50.930
dealing with different industries so

352

00:06:50.930  -->  00:06:50.940

353

00:06:50.940  -->  00:06:53.660
also some interesting data data, if

354

00:06:53.660  -->  00:06:53.670

355

00:06:53.670  -->  00:06:56.030
you are up if you're working in the

356

00:06:56.030  -->  00:06:56.040

357

00:06:56.040  -->  00:06:59.060
world over retail and finally if we

358

00:06:59.060  -->  00:06:59.070

359

00:06:59.070  -->  00:07:01.310
scroll down here we will see the section

360

00:07:01.310  -->  00:07:01.320

361

00:07:01.320  -->  00:07:03.860
on animations. So I've left the best for

362

00:07:03.860  -->  00:07:03.870

363

00:07:03.870  -->  00:07:06.230
last and this is gonna be a fun and

364

00:07:06.230  -->  00:07:06.240

365

00:07:06.240  -->  00:07:08.120
quick section where you will learn how

366

00:07:08.120  -->  00:07:08.130

367

00:07:08.130  -->  00:07:10.460
to create animations in Tableau and

368

00:07:10.460  -->  00:07:10.470

369

00:07:10.470  -->  00:07:12.350
also you'll see that animations are not

370

00:07:12.350  -->  00:07:12.360

371

00:07:12.360  -->  00:07:14.600
just a really cool feature in Tableau,

372

00:07:14.600  -->  00:07:14.610

373

00:07:14.610  -->  00:07:17.090
but actually allow you to visualize an

374

00:07:17.090  -->  00:07:17.100

375

00:07:17.100  -->  00:07:20.000
extra dimension and allow you to really

376

00:07:20.000  -->  00:07:20.010

377

00:07:20.010  -->  00:07:22.100
while your audience and give them more

378

00:07:22.100  -->  00:07:22.110

379

00:07:22.110  -->  00:07:24.560
flexibility around how they interact

380

00:07:24.560  -->  00:07:24.570

381

00:07:24.570  -->  00:07:27.110
with your dashboard. So this is a quick

382

00:07:27.110  -->  00:07:27.120

383

00:07:27.120  -->  00:07:28.910
section and in fact we will actually

384

00:07:28.910  -->  00:07:28.920

385

00:07:28.920  -->  00:07:31.700
build the visualization within the first

386

00:07:31.700  -->  00:07:31.710

387

00:07:31.710  -->  00:07:33.170
three tutorials and you will be

388

00:07:33.170  -->  00:07:33.180

389

00:07:33.180  -->  00:07:35.630
surprised at how quick and efficient

390

00:07:35.630  -->  00:07:35.640

391

00:07:35.640  -->  00:07:38.540
this functionality is in tableau and at

392

00:07:38.540  -->  00:07:38.550

393

00:07:38.550  -->  00:07:40.580
the end we've got the conclusion so

394

00:07:40.580  -->  00:07:40.590

395

00:07:40.590  -->  00:07:42.080
we've got the course overview where we

396

00:07:42.080  -->  00:07:42.090

397

00:07:42.090  -->  00:07:43.850
talk about these sections one more time

398

00:07:43.850  -->  00:07:43.860

399

00:07:43.860  -->  00:07:45.530
so you can always come back and

400

00:07:45.530  -->  00:07:45.540

401

00:07:45.540  -->  00:07:48.740
reference what you have learned and at

402

00:07:48.740  -->  00:07:48.750

403

00:07:48.750  -->  00:07:50.960
the very end we've got a special bonus

404

00:07:50.960  -->  00:07:50.970

405

00:07:50.970  -->  00:07:53.720
so this is my way of saying thank you to

406

00:07:53.720  -->  00:07:53.730

407

00:07:53.730  -->  00:07:56.030
you for taking this course so make sure

408

00:07:56.030  -->  00:07:56.040

409

00:07:56.040  -->  00:07:59.000
to check out that lecture. So there we go

410

00:07:59.000  -->  00:07:59.010

411

00:07:59.010  -->  00:08:00.530
those are the sections for this course

412

00:08:00.530  -->  00:08:00.540

413

00:08:00.540  -->  00:08:03.110
and one more thing to finish off i would

414

00:08:03.110  -->  00:08:03.120

415

00:08:03.120  -->  00:08:04.820
like to mention where to get the data

416

00:08:04.820  -->  00:08:04.830

417

00:08:04.830  -->  00:08:06.860
sets, this time around you need to go to

418

00:08:06.860  -->  00:08:06.870

419

00:08:06.870  -->  00:08:10.130
superdatascience.com/tableau-advanced

420

00:08:10.130  -->  00:08:10.140

421

00:08:10.140  -->  00:08:13.250
and if you scroll down

422

00:08:13.250  -->  00:08:13.260

423

00:08:13.260  -->  00:08:15.800
here you will see all of the data sets

424

00:08:15.800  -->  00:08:15.810

425

00:08:15.810  -->  00:08:17.750
for all the sections of these are the

426

00:08:17.750  -->  00:08:17.760

427

00:08:17.760  -->  00:08:19.790
main four sections and also you'll

428

00:08:19.790  -->  00:08:19.800

429

00:08:19.800  -->  00:08:21.290
notice that this time I've included this

430

00:08:21.290  -->  00:08:21.300

431

00:08:21.300  -->  00:08:23.690
challenges. So you've got a challenge for

432

00:08:23.690  -->  00:08:23.700

433

00:08:23.700  -->  00:08:25.340
every one of these sections and that is

434

00:08:25.340  -->  00:08:25.350

435

00:08:25.350  -->  00:08:27.620
because the sections are structured like

436

00:08:27.620  -->  00:08:27.630

437

00:08:27.630  -->  00:08:30.410
missions so this is your mission brief

438

00:08:30.410  -->  00:08:30.420

439

00:08:30.420  -->  00:08:32.719
and once you read it off you go straight

440

00:08:32.719  -->  00:08:32.729

441

00:08:32.729  -->  00:08:34.700
into the challenge.

442

00:08:34.700  -->  00:08:34.710

443

00:08:34.710  -->  00:08:37.580
It's um it's a way to combine learning

444

00:08:37.580  -->  00:08:37.590

445

00:08:37.590  -->  00:08:39.920
with a fun experience and I really do

446

00:08:39.920  -->  00:08:39.930

447

00:08:39.930  -->  00:08:42.140
hope that you have a lot of fun along

448

00:08:42.140  -->  00:08:42.150

449

00:08:42.150  -->  00:08:44.840
the way that is how this course is

450

00:08:44.840  -->  00:08:44.850

451

00:08:44.850  -->  00:08:46.400
designed. So I look forward to seeing in

452

00:08:46.400  -->  00:08:46.410

453

00:08:46.410  -->  00:08:48.440
the first tutorial and until then, happy

454

00:08:48.440  -->  00:08:48.450

455

00:08:48.450  -->  00:08:54.080
analyzing.
