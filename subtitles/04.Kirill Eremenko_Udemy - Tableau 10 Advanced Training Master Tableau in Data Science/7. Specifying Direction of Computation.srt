00:00:02,620  -->  00:00:06,929
Welcome back to the advanced course on

2

00:00:06,929  -->  00:00:06,939

3

00:00:06,939  -->  00:00:09,030
Tableau. In today's tutorial, we will talk

4

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:09,040

5

00:00:09,040  -->  00:00:11,220
about the direction of computation for

6

00:00:11,220  -->  00:00:11,230

7

00:00:11,230  -->  00:00:13,589
your table calculations. As you recall,

8

00:00:13,589  -->  00:00:13,599

9

00:00:13,599  -->  00:00:16,049
previously in order to get to the

10

00:00:16,049  -->  00:00:16,059

11

00:00:16,059  -->  00:00:18,210
direction of computation we would click

12

00:00:18,210  -->  00:00:18,220

13

00:00:18,220  -->  00:00:20,490
this drop-down and then would select

14

00:00:20,490  -->  00:00:20,500

15

00:00:20,500  -->  00:00:22,350
compute using and would either select

16

00:00:22,350  -->  00:00:22,360

17

00:00:22,360  -->  00:00:24,659
across or table down or we could go into

18

00:00:24,659  -->  00:00:24,669

19

00:00:24,669  -->  00:00:27,510
the table calculation and selected from

20

00:00:27,510  -->  00:00:27,520

21

00:00:27,520  -->  00:00:29,850
here. So compute using and currently it's

22

00:00:29,850  -->  00:00:29,860

23

00:00:29,860  -->  00:00:32,819
set to down now I would like to bring

24

00:00:32,819  -->  00:00:32,829

25

00:00:32,829  -->  00:00:34,380
your attention to the following fact

26

00:00:34,380  -->  00:00:34,390

27

00:00:34,390  -->  00:00:37,500
that this is an implicit way of

28

00:00:37,500  -->  00:00:37,510

29

00:00:37,510  -->  00:00:39,900
specifying the direction of computation

30

00:00:39,900  -->  00:00:39,910

31

00:00:39,910  -->  00:00:42,060
and in order to explain a bit better

32

00:00:42,060  -->  00:00:42,070

33

00:00:42,070  -->  00:00:43,979
what I mean, allow me to show you an

34

00:00:43,979  -->  00:00:43,989

35

00:00:43,989  -->  00:00:44,880
example,

36

00:00:44,880  -->  00:00:44,890

37

00:00:44,890  -->  00:00:46,380
so what I'm going to do now is I'm going

38

00:00:46,380  -->  00:00:46,390

39

00:00:46,390  -->  00:00:49,139
to right click the tab and say duplicate

40

00:00:49,139  -->  00:00:49,149

41

00:00:49,149  -->  00:00:52,049
sheet. Now on this copy of the sheet what

42

00:00:52,049  -->  00:00:52,059

43

00:00:52,059  -->  00:00:53,669
I'm going to do is click this button at

44

00:00:53,669  -->  00:00:53,679

45

00:00:53,679  -->  00:00:56,069
the top which is swap and what it will

46

00:00:56,069  -->  00:00:56,079

47

00:00:56,079  -->  00:00:58,380
do is it will swap the rows with the

48

00:00:58,380  -->  00:00:58,390

49

00:00:58,390  -->  00:00:59,790
columns so basically rows will become

50

00:00:59,790  -->  00:00:59,800

51

00:00:59,800  -->  00:01:01,709
columns, columns will become rows.

52

00:01:01,709  -->  00:01:01,719

53

00:01:01,719  -->  00:01:04,079
Let's go ahead and do that. Once you

54

00:01:04,079  -->  00:01:04,089

55

00:01:04,089  -->  00:01:06,630
click that swap button you can see the

56

00:01:06,630  -->  00:01:06,640

57

00:01:06,640  -->  00:01:09,030
same chart but now it's kind of an

58

00:01:09,030  -->  00:01:09,040

59

00:01:09,040  -->  00:01:12,510
inside and that is because the whole

60

00:01:12,510  -->  00:01:12,520

61

00:01:12,520  -->  00:01:15,450
table was flipped around in terms of

62

00:01:15,450  -->  00:01:15,460

63

00:01:15,460  -->  00:01:18,120
rows and columns and what you will

64

00:01:18,120  -->  00:01:18,130

65

00:01:18,130  -->  00:01:20,520
notice now is if you click the table

66

00:01:20,520  -->  00:01:20,530

67

00:01:20,530  -->  00:01:22,710
calculation and you go into edit table

68

00:01:22,710  -->  00:01:22,720

69

00:01:22,720  -->  00:01:24,930
calculation you will notice that it has

70

00:01:24,930  -->  00:01:24,940

71

00:01:24,940  -->  00:01:27,780
changed from table down to table across,

72

00:01:27,780  -->  00:01:27,790

73

00:01:27,790  -->  00:01:32,010
now why is that? Why has it changed to

74

00:01:32,010  -->  00:01:32,020

75

00:01:32,020  -->  00:01:33,750
table across? Well that is because

76

00:01:33,750  -->  00:01:33,760

77

00:01:33,760  -->  00:01:35,910
Tableau is smart it knows that

78

00:01:35,910  -->  00:01:35,920

79

00:01:35,920  -->  00:01:39,120
everything that used to be down on this

80

00:01:39,120  -->  00:01:39,130

81

00:01:39,130  -->  00:01:41,760
table or on in this visual has now

82

00:01:41,760  -->  00:01:41,770

83

00:01:41,770  -->  00:01:43,830
become across has become sideways so up

84

00:01:43,830  -->  00:01:43,840

85

00:01:43,840  -->  00:01:46,290
and down is now sideways and if you're

86

00:01:46,290  -->  00:01:46,300

87

00:01:46,300  -->  00:01:47,730
going to turn your head to the right you

88

00:01:47,730  -->  00:01:47,740

89

00:01:47,740  -->  00:01:50,070
can see the same table but it's just

90

00:01:50,070  -->  00:01:50,080

91

00:01:50,080  -->  00:01:52,650
it's that it's upside down. The blue used

92

00:01:52,650  -->  00:01:52,660

93

00:01:52,660  -->  00:01:54,990
to be at the top and it's also on its

94

00:01:54,990  -->  00:01:55,000

95

00:01:55,000  -->  00:01:58,050
side and well Tableau is smart so it's

96

00:01:58,050  -->  00:01:58,060

97

00:01:58,060  -->  00:02:00,390
changed that direction of computation

98

00:02:00,390  -->  00:02:00,400

99

00:02:00,400  -->  00:02:02,730
for us and that is what I mean when I

100

00:02:02,730  -->  00:02:02,740

101

00:02:02,740  -->  00:02:04,530
say that it is an implicit way to

102

00:02:04,530  -->  00:02:04,540

103

00:02:04,540  -->  00:02:06,690
specify your table calculation, so you're

104

00:02:06,690  -->  00:02:06,700

105

00:02:06,700  -->  00:02:08,609
basically telling Tableau in this

106

00:02:08,609  -->  00:02:08,619

107

00:02:08,619  -->  00:02:11,160
construction of our table. I want to

108

00:02:11,160  -->  00:02:11,170

109

00:02:11,170  -->  00:02:14,220
calculate the field downwards but then

110

00:02:14,220  -->  00:02:14,230

111

00:02:14,230  -->  00:02:15,990
when your construction of your table

112

00:02:15,990  -->  00:02:16,000

113

00:02:16,000  -->  00:02:19,080
changes like it did here, Tableau has to

114

00:02:19,080  -->  00:02:19,090

115

00:02:19,090  -->  00:02:21,030
automatically adjust and guess what you

116

00:02:21,030  -->  00:02:21,040

117

00:02:21,040  -->  00:02:23,820
were actually after and change your

118

00:02:23,820  -->  00:02:23,830

119

00:02:23,830  -->  00:02:26,370
Tableau calculation in the background and

120

00:02:26,370  -->  00:02:26,380

121

00:02:26,380  -->  00:02:28,440
so here my question to you is, Do you

122

00:02:28,440  -->  00:02:28,450

123

00:02:28,450  -->  00:02:31,200
really want to rely on Tableau adjusting

124

00:02:31,200  -->  00:02:31,210

125

00:02:31,210  -->  00:02:33,060
your table calculation for you every

126

00:02:33,060  -->  00:02:33,070

127

00:02:33,070  -->  00:02:35,850
single time something changes? It is kind

128

00:02:35,850  -->  00:02:35,860

129

00:02:35,860  -->  00:02:40,290
of a risky bet because maybe one day

130

00:02:40,290  -->  00:02:40,300

131

00:02:40,300  -->  00:02:43,170
your table calculation or your table

132

00:02:43,170  -->  00:02:43,180

133

00:02:43,180  -->  00:02:45,900
might change in a way that Tableau won't

134

00:02:45,900  -->  00:02:45,910

135

00:02:45,910  -->  00:02:48,150
adjust to table calculation and your table

136

00:02:48,150  -->  00:02:48,160

137

00:02:48,160  -->  00:02:50,640
calculation will therefore show

138

00:02:50,640  -->  00:02:50,650

139

00:02:50,650  -->  00:02:52,800
incorrect results. So in order to

140

00:02:52,800  -->  00:02:52,810

141

00:02:52,810  -->  00:02:55,800
minimize this risk or actually get rid

142

00:02:55,800  -->  00:02:55,810

143

00:02:55,810  -->  00:02:56,699
of it completely

144

00:02:56,699  -->  00:02:56,709

145

00:02:56,709  -->  00:02:59,160
the best way is to specify your table

146

00:02:59,160  -->  00:02:59,170

147

00:02:59,170  -->  00:03:01,800
calculations explicitly and now I'll

148

00:03:01,800  -->  00:03:01,810

149

00:03:01,810  -->  00:03:03,570
show you how to do that with your quick

150

00:03:03,570  -->  00:03:03,580

151

00:03:03,580  -->  00:03:04,979
table calculations like the one we see

152

00:03:04,979  -->  00:03:04,989

153

00:03:04,989  -->  00:03:08,790
here and with your table calculations

154

00:03:08,790  -->  00:03:08,800

155

00:03:08,800  -->  00:03:12,479
which are saved in your measures. By the

156

00:03:12,479  -->  00:03:12,489

157

00:03:12,489  -->  00:03:14,910
way, this is a calculated field which we

158

00:03:14,910  -->  00:03:14,920

159

00:03:14,920  -->  00:03:17,550
dragged here so if you put your mouse

160

00:03:17,550  -->  00:03:17,560

161

00:03:17,560  -->  00:03:19,740
over it says idle capacity percent pause

162

00:03:19,740  -->  00:03:19,750

163

00:03:19,750  -->  00:03:23,490
but at the same time it is reflected as

164

00:03:23,490  -->  00:03:23,500

165

00:03:23,500  -->  00:03:25,830
a table calculation and the control is

166

00:03:25,830  -->  00:03:25,840

167

00:03:25,840  -->  00:03:27,420
separate you'll see what I mean just now

168

00:03:27,420  -->  00:03:27,430

169

00:03:27,430  -->  00:03:29,729
when we change this one not necessarily

170

00:03:29,729  -->  00:03:29,739

171

00:03:29,739  -->  00:03:31,830
will your idle capacity percent change

172

00:03:31,830  -->  00:03:31,840

173

00:03:31,840  -->  00:03:34,860
so it is important to keep track of

174

00:03:34,860  -->  00:03:34,870

175

00:03:34,870  -->  00:03:36,660
these things and I'll explain what the

176

00:03:36,660  -->  00:03:36,670

177

00:03:36,670  -->  00:03:39,300
best way up to go about that is as well

178

00:03:39,300  -->  00:03:39,310

179

00:03:39,310  -->  00:03:41,009
but towards the end of this tutorial. So

180

00:03:41,009  -->  00:03:41,019

181

00:03:41,019  -->  00:03:44,130
to start off with, how can we make sure

182

00:03:44,130  -->  00:03:44,140

183

00:03:44,140  -->  00:03:46,620
that we specify explicitly the direction

184

00:03:46,620  -->  00:03:46,630

185

00:03:46,630  -->  00:03:48,660
of computation? Well it's pretty simple

186

00:03:48,660  -->  00:03:48,670

187

00:03:48,670  -->  00:03:52,680
if you go into your drop down here and

188

00:03:52,680  -->  00:03:52,690

189

00:03:52,690  -->  00:03:54,240
it's like computer using you'll see that

190

00:03:54,240  -->  00:03:54,250

191

00:03:54,250  -->  00:03:56,880
among all other options table

192

00:03:56,880  -->  00:03:56,890

193

00:03:56,890  -->  00:03:58,830
cross, table down and combinations and

194

00:03:58,830  -->  00:03:58,840

195

00:03:58,840  -->  00:04:00,180
pains and cells and so on.

196

00:04:00,180  -->  00:04:00,190

197

00:04:00,190  -->  00:04:02,580
You've got fields here at the bottom so

198

00:04:02,580  -->  00:04:02,590

199

00:04:02,590  -->  00:04:04,319
here we've got daytime which is this

200

00:04:04,319  -->  00:04:04,329

201

00:04:04,329  -->  00:04:06,030
field and machine which is this field

202

00:04:06,030  -->  00:04:06,040

203

00:04:06,040  -->  00:04:07,890
and same thing if we're going to edit

204

00:04:07,890  -->  00:04:07,900

205

00:04:07,900  -->  00:04:11,460
table calculation, you'll once again see

206

00:04:11,460  -->  00:04:11,470

207

00:04:11,470  -->  00:04:13,560
that from this drop-down you can select

208

00:04:13,560  -->  00:04:13,570

209

00:04:13,570  -->  00:04:15,630
your daytime or you can set your machine

210

00:04:15,630  -->  00:04:15,640

211

00:04:15,640  -->  00:04:19,860
and in this specific case we know that

212

00:04:19,860  -->  00:04:19,870

213

00:04:19,870  -->  00:04:22,620
daytime is our horizontal axis. Machine

214

00:04:22,620  -->  00:04:22,630

215

00:04:22,630  -->  00:04:25,740
is our vertical axis, so if you want to

216

00:04:25,740  -->  00:04:25,750

217

00:04:25,750  -->  00:04:27,870
to do the table calculation, let's say

218

00:04:27,870  -->  00:04:27,880

219

00:04:27,880  -->  00:04:29,640
across for to start with you

220

00:04:29,640  -->  00:04:29,650

221

00:04:29,650  -->  00:04:31,290
would like to do the table calculation

222

00:04:31,290  -->  00:04:31,300

223

00:04:31,300  -->  00:04:33,390
across, then instead of saying table

224

00:04:33,390  -->  00:04:33,400

225

00:04:33,400  -->  00:04:37,020
across it is better to say daytime. Click

226

00:04:37,020  -->  00:04:37,030

227

00:04:37,030  -->  00:04:38,999
apply, and there you can see the same

228

00:04:38,999  -->  00:04:39,009

229

00:04:39,009  -->  00:04:41,129
result that we solve for table across

230

00:04:41,129  -->  00:04:41,139

231

00:04:41,139  -->  00:04:44,700
because the calculation has been

232

00:04:44,700  -->  00:04:44,710

233

00:04:44,710  -->  00:04:48,570
performed across data, now if we want our

234

00:04:48,570  -->  00:04:48,580

235

00:04:48,580  -->  00:04:50,760
actual true result that we're after if

236

00:04:50,760  -->  00:04:50,770

237

00:04:50,770  -->  00:04:52,890
we click machine and we click apply

238

00:04:52,890  -->  00:04:52,900

239

00:04:52,900  -->  00:04:57,689
which you'll see here is that now we

240

00:04:57,689  -->  00:04:57,699

241

00:04:57,699  -->  00:04:59,460
have the correct result and this is the

242

00:04:59,460  -->  00:04:59,470

243

00:04:59,470  -->  00:05:01,230
same as table down but in this case it's

244

00:05:01,230  -->  00:05:01,240

245

00:05:01,240  -->  00:05:03,270
using the machine field and we can click

246

00:05:03,270  -->  00:05:03,280

247

00:05:03,280  -->  00:05:07,740
ok and if we now duplicate the sheet

248

00:05:07,740  -->  00:05:07,750

249

00:05:07,750  -->  00:05:11,250
again and we transpose it or swap it

250

00:05:11,250  -->  00:05:11,260

251

00:05:11,260  -->  00:05:14,939
around and now we go into the table

252

00:05:14,939  -->  00:05:14,949

253

00:05:14,949  -->  00:05:17,100
calculation, you will see that it is

254

00:05:17,100  -->  00:05:17,110

255

00:05:17,110  -->  00:05:19,469
still machine. So this is an explicit

256

00:05:19,469  -->  00:05:19,479

257

00:05:19,479  -->  00:05:23,159
specification of your computation

258

00:05:23,159  -->  00:05:23,169

259

00:05:23,169  -->  00:05:26,040
direction and Tableau respect that and

260

00:05:26,040  -->  00:05:26,050

261

00:05:26,050  -->  00:05:29,460
it will keep that regardless of how you

262

00:05:29,460  -->  00:05:29,470

263

00:05:29,470  -->  00:05:31,170
use this table calculation because it

264

00:05:31,170  -->  00:05:31,180

265

00:05:31,180  -->  00:05:32,730
doesn't have to guess anything. It knows

266

00:05:32,730  -->  00:05:32,740

267

00:05:32,740  -->  00:05:34,560
you telling it exactly what you want you

268

00:05:34,560  -->  00:05:34,570

269

00:05:34,570  -->  00:05:37,800
want to calculate it across this field

270

00:05:37,800  -->  00:05:37,810

271

00:05:37,810  -->  00:05:38,670
machine.

272

00:05:38,670  -->  00:05:38,680

273

00:05:38,680  -->  00:05:40,620
Ok so let's go back to our sheet, we can

274

00:05:40,620  -->  00:05:40,630

275

00:05:40,630  -->  00:05:44,100
actually delete this one so we don't we

276

00:05:44,100  -->  00:05:44,110

277

00:05:44,110  -->  00:05:46,320
don't get flooded with sheets. We'll

278

00:05:46,320  -->  00:05:46,330

279

00:05:46,330  -->  00:05:48,689
delete that on a bit later so there we

280

00:05:48,689  -->  00:05:48,699

281

00:05:48,699  -->  00:05:51,510
go so that's our original sheet, we've

282

00:05:51,510  -->  00:05:51,520

283

00:05:51,520  -->  00:05:53,850
changed this calculation but what you

284

00:05:53,850  -->  00:05:53,860

285

00:05:53,860  -->  00:05:55,920
will notice now is if I right click this,

286

00:05:55,920  -->  00:05:55,930

287

00:05:55,930  -->  00:05:58,290
it isn't reflected as a table

288

00:05:58,290  -->  00:05:58,300

289

00:05:58,300  -->  00:06:00,029
calculation here. It is a calculated

290

00:06:00,029  -->  00:06:00,039

291

00:06:00,039  -->  00:06:02,760
field, so it is using a table calculation

292

00:06:02,760  -->  00:06:02,770

293

00:06:02,770  -->  00:06:04,560
but it is reflected as a calculated

294

00:06:04,560  -->  00:06:04,570

295

00:06:04,570  -->  00:06:06,149
field and only becomes a table

296

00:06:06,149  -->  00:06:06,159

297

00:06:06,159  -->  00:06:07,770
calculation once I drag it into the

298

00:06:07,770  -->  00:06:07,780

299

00:06:07,780  -->  00:06:10,230
chart like what we did here. So in order

300

00:06:10,230  -->  00:06:10,240

301

00:06:10,240  -->  00:06:13,020
to change the table calculations so what

302

00:06:13,020  -->  00:06:13,030

303

00:06:13,030  -->  00:06:14,520
I'm trying to do now is I want to

304

00:06:14,520  -->  00:06:14,530

305

00:06:14,530  -->  00:06:16,830
specify that I want to calculate across

306

00:06:16,830  -->  00:06:16,840

307

00:06:16,840  -->  00:06:19,830
this specific field. I want to specify

308

00:06:19,830  -->  00:06:19,840

309

00:06:19,840  -->  00:06:21,510
that in my table calculation that is

310

00:06:21,510  -->  00:06:21,520

311

00:06:21,520  -->  00:06:23,820
saved. This wasn't the saved one. This was

312

00:06:23,820  -->  00:06:23,830

313

00:06:23,830  -->  00:06:26,070
the one that I see in the visual so how

314

00:06:26,070  -->  00:06:26,080

315

00:06:26,080  -->  00:06:27,510
do I specify that in the table

316

00:06:27,510  -->  00:06:27,520

317

00:06:27,520  -->  00:06:29,070
calculation? Well, you have to go to the

318

00:06:29,070  -->  00:06:29,080

319

00:06:29,080  -->  00:06:32,879
table calculation itself and go to edit

320

00:06:32,879  -->  00:06:32,889

321

00:06:32,889  -->  00:06:36,149
and here you will see that this is the

322

00:06:36,149  -->  00:06:36,159

323

00:06:36,159  -->  00:06:38,640
table calculation because it is using

324

00:06:38,640  -->  00:06:38,650

325

00:06:38,650  -->  00:06:41,129
table calculation formulas. We'll talk

326

00:06:41,129  -->  00:06:41,139

327

00:06:41,139  -->  00:06:42,510
more about these in the coming tutorials

328

00:06:42,510  -->  00:06:42,520

329

00:06:42,520  -->  00:06:43,320
in

330

00:06:43,320  -->  00:06:43,330

331

00:06:43,330  -->  00:06:45,330
this section but I'll quickly give you a

332

00:06:45,330  -->  00:06:45,340

333

00:06:45,340  -->  00:06:47,790
hint. So if you look at these formulas

334

00:06:47,790  -->  00:06:47,800

335

00:06:47,800  -->  00:06:50,369
like look up right, so that is the table

336

00:06:50,369  -->  00:06:50,379

337

00:06:50,379  -->  00:06:52,379
calculation, table formula here and if

338

00:06:52,379  -->  00:06:52,389

339

00:06:52,389  -->  00:06:54,390
you click the drop-down you go to table

340

00:06:54,390  -->  00:06:54,400

341

00:06:54,400  -->  00:06:56,580
calculation and all these formulas that

342

00:06:56,580  -->  00:06:56,590

343

00:06:56,590  -->  00:06:58,439
you see here which we once again we'll

344

00:06:58,439  -->  00:06:58,449

345

00:06:58,449  -->  00:07:00,839
discuss in the coming tutorials of this

346

00:07:00,839  -->  00:07:00,849

347

00:07:00,849  -->  00:07:01,589
section

348

00:07:01,589  -->  00:07:01,599

349

00:07:01,599  -->  00:07:04,709
these are table calculation formulas and

350

00:07:04,709  -->  00:07:04,719

351

00:07:04,719  -->  00:07:06,390
in this case the one that has been used

352

00:07:06,390  -->  00:07:06,400

353

00:07:06,400  -->  00:07:08,909
is look up. This formula has been

354

00:07:08,909  -->  00:07:08,919

355

00:07:08,919  -->  00:07:11,760
generated automatically for us and it is

356

00:07:11,760  -->  00:07:11,770

357

00:07:11,770  -->  00:07:14,100
using a table calculation formula and

358

00:07:14,100  -->  00:07:14,110

359

00:07:14,110  -->  00:07:17,369
therefore this is a Tableau a saved Tableau

360

00:07:17,369  -->  00:07:17,379

361

00:07:17,379  -->  00:07:20,700
calculation. Now for saved table

362

00:07:20,700  -->  00:07:20,710

363

00:07:20,710  -->  00:07:22,950
calculations, you'll see here a comment

364

00:07:22,950  -->  00:07:22,960

365

00:07:22,960  -->  00:07:24,779
which says how there is also being

366

00:07:24,779  -->  00:07:24,789

367

00:07:24,789  -->  00:07:26,550
computer? Results are computed a long

368

00:07:26,550  -->  00:07:26,560

369

00:07:26,560  -->  00:07:29,610
table down. So as you can tell even

370

00:07:29,610  -->  00:07:29,620

371

00:07:29,620  -->  00:07:31,559
though we change the computation method

372

00:07:31,559  -->  00:07:31,569

373

00:07:31,569  -->  00:07:34,950
here, it hasn't changed in the saved

374

00:07:34,950  -->  00:07:34,960

375

00:07:34,960  -->  00:07:36,990
table calculation that is important to

376

00:07:36,990  -->  00:07:37,000

377

00:07:37,000  -->  00:07:39,510
keep in mind. Sometimes people get this

378

00:07:39,510  -->  00:07:39,520

379

00:07:39,520  -->  00:07:42,179
wrong and they fix it up here or they

380

00:07:42,179  -->  00:07:42,189

381

00:07:42,189  -->  00:07:44,100
make changes to the table calculation

382

00:07:44,100  -->  00:07:44,110

383

00:07:44,110  -->  00:07:45,659
has been displayed but it's not actually

384

00:07:45,659  -->  00:07:45,669

385

00:07:45,669  -->  00:07:47,730
making changes to the save table

386

00:07:47,730  -->  00:07:47,740

387

00:07:47,740  -->  00:07:49,860
calculation so be careful of that. What we're

388

00:07:49,860  -->  00:07:49,870

389

00:07:49,870  -->  00:07:51,089
going to do now is we're going to update

390

00:07:51,089  -->  00:07:51,099

391

00:07:51,099  -->  00:07:54,059
this to make sure it's reflecting the

392

00:07:54,059  -->  00:07:54,069

393

00:07:54,069  -->  00:07:57,570
explicit specification of the

394

00:07:57,570  -->  00:07:57,580

395

00:07:57,580  -->  00:08:00,689
computation direction. So let's go and

396

00:08:00,689  -->  00:08:00,699

397

00:08:00,699  -->  00:08:02,730
click this button here default table

398

00:08:02,730  -->  00:08:02,740

399

00:08:02,740  -->  00:08:05,999
calculation. This is here specifically

400

00:08:05,999  -->  00:08:06,009

401

00:08:06,009  -->  00:08:07,829
for those reasons. It was only present

402

00:08:07,829  -->  00:08:07,839

403

00:08:07,839  -->  00:08:09,839
when you use table calculations and this

404

00:08:09,839  -->  00:08:09,849

405

00:08:09,849  -->  00:08:12,059
is exactly what it's for. It's for you to

406

00:08:12,059  -->  00:08:12,069

407

00:08:12,069  -->  00:08:15,240
be able to change your computation. So as

408

00:08:15,240  -->  00:08:15,250

409

00:08:15,250  -->  00:08:16,649
you can see, those that's the pretty much

410

00:08:16,649  -->  00:08:16,659

411

00:08:16,659  -->  00:08:19,110
only menu here and here we can specify

412

00:08:19,110  -->  00:08:19,120

413

00:08:19,120  -->  00:08:21,869
either daytime there for this table will

414

00:08:21,869  -->  00:08:21,879

415

00:08:21,879  -->  00:08:24,959
be there cross or we can specify the

416

00:08:24,959  -->  00:08:24,969

417

00:08:24,969  -->  00:08:26,939
machine which will be down for this

418

00:08:26,939  -->  00:08:26,949

419

00:08:26,949  -->  00:08:28,920
table. So let's go ahead and specify down,

420

00:08:28,920  -->  00:08:28,930

421

00:08:28,930  -->  00:08:32,880
click OK , click apply, click OK and now we

422

00:08:32,880  -->  00:08:32,890

423

00:08:32,890  -->  00:08:35,159
have actually fixed up our table

424

00:08:35,159  -->  00:08:35,169

425

00:08:35,169  -->  00:08:36,990
calculation the one that is saved and

426

00:08:36,990  -->  00:08:37,000

427

00:08:37,000  -->  00:08:39,779
good practice or a good habit to develop

428

00:08:39,779  -->  00:08:39,789

429

00:08:39,789  -->  00:08:41,969
is that once you've saved fixed up your

430

00:08:41,969  -->  00:08:41,979

431

00:08:41,979  -->  00:08:44,639
table calculation that is saved. It is a

432

00:08:44,639  -->  00:08:44,649

433

00:08:44,649  -->  00:08:46,019
good idea to update the table

434

00:08:46,019  -->  00:08:46,029

435

00:08:46,029  -->  00:08:48,360
calculation in your view so to do that

436

00:08:48,360  -->  00:08:48,370

437

00:08:48,370  -->  00:08:51,569
just drag the field that is here and

438

00:08:51,569  -->  00:08:51,579

439

00:08:51,579  -->  00:08:54,240
replace it again and what that does

440

00:08:54,240  -->  00:08:54,250

441

00:08:54,250  -->  00:08:56,670
sometimes is it gets rid of your reference

442

00:08:56,670  -->  00:08:56,680

443

00:08:56,680  -->  00:08:58,620
line, but that's not a problem. Just add

444

00:08:58,620  -->  00:08:58,630

445

00:08:58,630  -->  00:09:01,740
the reference line again so constant and

446

00:09:01,740  -->  00:09:01,750

447

00:09:01,750  -->  00:09:04,800
0.1 and we're doing that because once

448

00:09:04,800  -->  00:09:04,810

449

00:09:04,810  -->  00:09:06,510
you update your table calculation here,

450

00:09:06,510  -->  00:09:06,520

451

00:09:06,520  -->  00:09:10,350
it's not necessarily will be updated in

452

00:09:10,350  -->  00:09:10,360

453

00:09:10,360  -->  00:09:12,720
your view because as you noticed it it

454

00:09:12,720  -->  00:09:12,730

455

00:09:12,730  -->  00:09:13,740
doesn't work the better the other way

456

00:09:13,740  -->  00:09:13,750

457

00:09:13,750  -->  00:09:15,180
around backwards backwards when she

458

00:09:15,180  -->  00:09:15,190

459

00:09:15,190  -->  00:09:16,560
updated here does not be here so they

460

00:09:16,560  -->  00:09:16,570

461

00:09:16,570  -->  00:09:18,660
kind of separate it's always a good idea

462

00:09:18,660  -->  00:09:18,670

463

00:09:18,670  -->  00:09:20,910
to want to update your table calculation

464

00:09:20,910  -->  00:09:20,920

465

00:09:20,920  -->  00:09:22,680
here, if you do want updated in the

466

00:09:22,680  -->  00:09:22,690

467

00:09:22,690  -->  00:09:25,410
specific view, then do drag it back in

468

00:09:25,410  -->  00:09:25,420

469

00:09:25,420  -->  00:09:27,990
here and update your table calculation.

470

00:09:27,990  -->  00:09:28,000

471

00:09:28,000  -->  00:09:30,570
So there we go, that is how you

472

00:09:30,570  -->  00:09:30,580

473

00:09:30,580  -->  00:09:33,000
explicitly specify the direction of

474

00:09:33,000  -->  00:09:33,010

475

00:09:33,010  -->  00:09:35,190
computation for your table calculations

476

00:09:35,190  -->  00:09:35,200

477

00:09:35,200  -->  00:09:36,690
whether they are quick table

478

00:09:36,690  -->  00:09:36,700

479

00:09:36,700  -->  00:09:38,430
calculations present just in the view

480

00:09:38,430  -->  00:09:38,440

481

00:09:38,440  -->  00:09:41,430
in your view or they are actually saved

482

00:09:41,430  -->  00:09:41,440

483

00:09:41,440  -->  00:09:43,650
table calculations which are present in

484

00:09:43,650  -->  00:09:43,660

485

00:09:43,660  -->  00:09:45,630
your measures. Hope you found this

486

00:09:45,630  -->  00:09:45,640

487

00:09:45,640  -->  00:09:47,400
tutorial useful and I highly recommend

488

00:09:47,400  -->  00:09:47,410

489

00:09:47,410  -->  00:09:49,230
using this method wherever you can

490

00:09:49,230  -->  00:09:49,240

491

00:09:49,240  -->  00:09:52,199
because it will save you from any

492

00:09:52,199  -->  00:09:52,209

493

00:09:52,209  -->  00:09:54,449
potential errors that might occur when

494

00:09:54,449  -->  00:09:54,459

495

00:09:54,459  -->  00:09:57,840
you don't use explicit specification and

496

00:09:57,840  -->  00:09:57,850

497

00:09:57,850  -->  00:09:59,040
I look forward to seeing you in the next

498

00:09:59,040  -->  00:09:59,050

499

00:09:59,050  -->  00:09:59,699
tutorial.

500

00:09:59,699  -->  00:09:59,709

501

00:09:59,709  -->  00:10:06,450
Until then, Happy Analyzing!
