00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.619
Welcome back to the advanced course in

2

00:00:06.619  -->  00:00:06.629

3

00:00:06.629  -->  00:00:08.419
Tableau by now we're getting very

4

00:00:08.419  -->  00:00:08.429

5

00:00:08.429  -->  00:00:11.180
comfortable with working with sets we've

6

00:00:11.180  -->  00:00:11.190

7

00:00:11.190  -->  00:00:13.070
done a couple of tutorials on them and

8

00:00:13.070  -->  00:00:13.080

9

00:00:13.080  -->  00:00:14.780
we've already learned even how to

10

00:00:14.780  -->  00:00:14.790

11

00:00:14.790  -->  00:00:17.000
combine sets to achieve results like that.

12

00:00:17.000  -->  00:00:17.010

13

00:00:17.010  -->  00:00:19.640
And today we're going to learn how to

14

00:00:19.640  -->  00:00:19.650

15

00:00:19.650  -->  00:00:22.189
use parameters to control our set.

16

00:00:22.189  -->  00:00:22.199

17

00:00:22.199  -->  00:00:24.470
It's going to be quite a powerful

18

00:00:24.470  -->  00:00:24.480

19

00:00:24.480  -->  00:00:26.060
combination when you put those two

20

00:00:26.060  -->  00:00:26.070

21

00:00:26.070  -->  00:00:28.099
together and we're going to start by

22

00:00:28.099  -->  00:00:28.109

23

00:00:28.109  -->  00:00:29.929
remembering about that said that we

24

00:00:29.929  -->  00:00:29.939

25

00:00:29.939  -->  00:00:32.420
created a while ago for growth. So here

26

00:00:32.420  -->  00:00:32.430

27

00:00:32.430  -->  00:00:34.370
it is the dynamic set that we created,

28

00:00:34.370  -->  00:00:34.380

29

00:00:34.380  -->  00:00:38.270
top start ups by growth dynamic set and

30

00:00:38.270  -->  00:00:38.280

31

00:00:38.280  -->  00:00:41.569
as you recall we even apply to our tree

32

00:00:41.569  -->  00:00:41.579

33

00:00:41.579  -->  00:00:45.410
map so here as we change the set the

34

00:00:45.410  -->  00:00:45.420

35

00:00:45.420  -->  00:00:47.630
tree map changes. So how about we go and

36

00:00:47.630  -->  00:00:47.640

37

00:00:47.640  -->  00:00:49.190
create a parameter that will allow the

38

00:00:49.190  -->  00:00:49.200

39

00:00:49.200  -->  00:00:51.860
user to change the set so right now in

40

00:00:51.860  -->  00:00:51.870

41

00:00:51.870  -->  00:00:54.619
order to change the specification of the

42

00:00:54.619  -->  00:00:54.629

43

00:00:54.629  -->  00:00:57.049
set, we have to go into edit set and we

44

00:00:57.049  -->  00:00:57.059

45

00:00:57.059  -->  00:01:01.939
have to set the value over here. But now

46

00:01:01.939  -->  00:01:01.949

47

00:01:01.949  -->  00:01:03.709
we'll create a parameter so the user

48

00:01:03.709  -->  00:01:03.719

49

00:01:03.719  -->  00:01:05.450
will be able to toggle it over here and

50

00:01:05.450  -->  00:01:05.460

51

00:01:05.460  -->  00:01:07.160
adjust that set, so let's go ahead and do

52

00:01:07.160  -->  00:01:07.170

53

00:01:07.170  -->  00:01:09.170
that. We're going to right click here and

54

00:01:09.170  -->  00:01:09.180

55

00:01:09.180  -->  00:01:12.050
select create a parameter and we're

56

00:01:12.050  -->  00:01:12.060

57

00:01:12.060  -->  00:01:15.800
going to call this parameter growth

58

00:01:15.800  -->  00:01:15.810

59

00:01:15.810  -->  00:01:19.340
leaders. So that's how many we want to

60

00:01:19.340  -->  00:01:19.350

61

00:01:19.350  -->  00:01:22.249
look at and we'll get a current value of

62

00:01:22.249  -->  00:01:22.259

63

00:01:22.259  -->  00:01:26.480
10 and of course not float it's an

64

00:01:26.480  -->  00:01:26.490

65

00:01:26.490  -->  00:01:29.480
integer so it's a whole number, display

66

00:01:29.480  -->  00:01:29.490

67

00:01:29.490  -->  00:01:31.940
automatic so I want to give it a range,

68

00:01:31.940  -->  00:01:31.950

69

00:01:31.950  -->  00:01:35.990
so let's say the person that's looking

70

00:01:35.990  -->  00:01:36.000

71

00:01:36.000  -->  00:01:38.030
at this dashboard can say that this

72

00:01:38.030  -->  00:01:38.040

73

00:01:38.040  -->  00:01:40.249
parameter can range from 5 all the way

74

00:01:40.249  -->  00:01:40.259

75

00:01:40.259  -->  00:01:43.639
up to a hundred and four natural step of

76

00:01:43.639  -->  00:01:43.649

77

00:01:43.649  -->  00:01:46.580
one, so if we click OK.

78

00:01:46.580  -->  00:01:46.590

79

00:01:46.590  -->  00:01:49.130
I know as you can see we have less space

80

00:01:49.130  -->  00:01:49.140

81

00:01:49.140  -->  00:01:52.490
because I knew tab has appeared here with

82

00:01:52.490  -->  00:01:52.500

83

00:01:52.500  -->  00:01:55.670
parameters and let's go ahead and put

84

00:01:55.670  -->  00:01:55.680

85

00:01:55.680  -->  00:01:58.069
this parameter onto our sheet and we

86

00:01:58.069  -->  00:01:58.079

87

00:01:58.079  -->  00:02:01.700
will click show parameter control so

88

00:02:01.700  -->  00:02:01.710

89

00:02:01.710  -->  00:02:03.679
here the person can change the parameter

90

00:02:03.679  -->  00:02:03.689

91

00:02:03.689  -->  00:02:04.969
but as you can see for now it does

92

00:02:04.969  -->  00:02:04.979

93

00:02:04.979  -->  00:02:06.770
absolutely nothing because it's not

94

00:02:06.770  -->  00:02:06.780

95

00:02:06.780  -->  00:02:08.270
connected to anything. Let's connect it to

96

00:02:08.270  -->  00:02:08.280

97

00:02:08.280  -->  00:02:10.070
our set,

98

00:02:10.070  -->  00:02:10.080

99

00:02:10.080  -->  00:02:11.869
so this is the center connecting to the

100

00:02:11.869  -->  00:02:11.879

101

00:02:11.879  -->  00:02:12.890
dynamic set

102

00:02:12.890  -->  00:02:12.900

103

00:02:12.900  -->  00:02:16.339
and we'll click edit set and in the top

104

00:02:16.339  -->  00:02:16.349

105

00:02:16.349  -->  00:02:18.170
here instead of a number

106

00:02:18.170  -->  00:02:18.180

107

00:02:18.180  -->  00:02:20.390
we're going to select our parameter. Here

108

00:02:20.390  -->  00:02:20.400

109

00:02:20.400  -->  00:02:23.270
it is growth leaders, click apply

110

00:02:23.270  -->  00:02:23.280

111

00:02:23.280  -->  00:02:25.100
ok and as you can see right away

112

00:02:25.100  -->  00:02:25.110

113

00:02:25.110  -->  00:02:27.110
everything is changing so as we change

114

00:02:27.110  -->  00:02:27.120

115

00:02:27.120  -->  00:02:30.199
the parameter we are able to control our

116

00:02:30.199  -->  00:02:30.209

117

00:02:30.209  -->  00:02:33.619
visualization. The number of leaders that

118

00:02:33.619  -->  00:02:33.629

119

00:02:33.629  -->  00:02:34.849
are being displayed as you can see the

120

00:02:34.849  -->  00:02:34.859

121

00:02:34.859  -->  00:02:37.039
minimum is five, the maximum is a hundred

122

00:02:37.039  -->  00:02:37.049

123

00:02:37.049  -->  00:02:39.229
and this controls our tree map. We're not

124

00:02:39.229  -->  00:02:39.239

125

00:02:39.239  -->  00:02:40.759
going to worry about the fact that the

126

00:02:40.759  -->  00:02:40.769

127

00:02:40.769  -->  00:02:44.839
tree map formatting is affected by the

128

00:02:44.839  -->  00:02:44.849

129

00:02:44.849  -->  00:02:47.539
number of growth. It is that we select

130

00:02:47.539  -->  00:02:47.549

131

00:02:47.549  -->  00:02:48.920
because that's not going to be our

132

00:02:48.920  -->  00:02:48.930

133

00:02:48.930  -->  00:02:51.890
concern. Our main focus was that now we

134

00:02:51.890  -->  00:02:51.900

135

00:02:51.900  -->  00:02:53.599
are controlling, we have a parameter that

136

00:02:53.599  -->  00:02:53.609

137

00:02:53.609  -->  00:02:56.960
can control this set with and now we're

138

00:02:56.960  -->  00:02:56.970

139

00:02:56.970  -->  00:02:59.629
going to go ahead and create parameters

140

00:02:59.629  -->  00:02:59.639

141

00:02:59.639  -->  00:03:02.030
that will control our other two sets

142

00:03:02.030  -->  00:03:02.040

143

00:03:02.040  -->  00:03:04.039
which reason the scatterplot and those

144

00:03:04.039  -->  00:03:04.049

145

00:03:04.049  -->  00:03:05.960
are the high revenue and low expensive

146

00:03:05.960  -->  00:03:05.970

147

00:03:05.970  -->  00:03:07.789
sets. So let's go ahead and create those

148

00:03:07.789  -->  00:03:07.799

149

00:03:07.799  -->  00:03:10.819
parameters. Parameter this one we'll call

150

00:03:10.819  -->  00:03:10.829

151

00:03:10.829  -->  00:03:17.720
our revenue cut off and we'll give it a

152

00:03:17.720  -->  00:03:17.730

153

00:03:17.730  -->  00:03:19.280
current value doesn't really matter

154

00:03:19.280  -->  00:03:19.290

155

00:03:19.290  -->  00:03:23.030
let's give it a current value of 10

156

00:03:23.030  -->  00:03:23.040

157

00:03:23.040  -->  00:03:27.289
million as it is right now and we won't

158

00:03:27.289  -->  00:03:27.299

159

00:03:27.299  -->  00:03:30.500
touch that for now so range minimum,

160

00:03:30.500  -->  00:03:30.510

161

00:03:30.510  -->  00:03:33.020
maximum you can get these from a field

162

00:03:33.020  -->  00:03:33.030

163

00:03:33.030  -->  00:03:34.939
so if you click set from field and

164

00:03:34.939  -->  00:03:34.949

165

00:03:34.949  -->  00:03:39.170
select 2015 revenue they will populate

166

00:03:39.170  -->  00:03:39.180

167

00:03:39.180  -->  00:03:41.030
automatically you just change this one to 0

168

00:03:41.030  -->  00:03:41.040

169

00:03:41.040  -->  00:03:44.869
and also we don't want to be a flawed

170

00:03:44.869  -->  00:03:44.879

171

00:03:44.879  -->  00:03:47.330
because nobody's going to specify up to a

172

00:03:47.330  -->  00:03:47.340

173

00:03:47.340  -->  00:03:50.869
decimal points that kind of level so

174

00:03:50.869  -->  00:03:50.879

175

00:03:50.879  -->  00:03:53.330
we'll just change it to an integer, just

176

00:03:53.330  -->  00:03:53.340

177

00:03:53.340  -->  00:03:56.629
for aesthetics and we'll click OK and

178

00:03:56.629  -->  00:03:56.639

179

00:03:56.639  -->  00:04:00.080
also we will create a perimeter this

180

00:04:00.080  -->  00:04:00.090

181

00:04:00.090  -->  00:04:02.869
time for expenses so we'll call it

182

00:04:02.869  -->  00:04:02.879

183

00:04:02.879  -->  00:04:07.729
expenses cut off. This one will be

184

00:04:07.729  -->  00:04:07.739

185

00:04:07.739  -->  00:04:12.890
we'll set it at five million and range

186

00:04:12.890  -->  00:04:12.900

187

00:04:12.900  -->  00:04:15.830
once again minimum maximum we'll set it

188

00:04:15.830  -->  00:04:15.840

189

00:04:15.840  -->  00:04:19.670
from my field 2015 expenses put this to 0

190

00:04:19.670  -->  00:04:19.680

191

00:04:19.680  -->  00:04:21.830
and then changes this to integer.

192

00:04:21.830  -->  00:04:21.840

193

00:04:21.840  -->  00:04:25.939
Okay so that looks good, now let's embed

194

00:04:25.939  -->  00:04:25.949

195

00:04:25.949  -->  00:04:28.670
these parameters into our set and this

196

00:04:28.670  -->  00:04:28.680

197

00:04:28.680  -->  00:04:29.960
is actually going to be a bit different

198

00:04:29.960  -->  00:04:29.970

199

00:04:29.970  -->  00:04:32.780
and I'll show you why. So if I click and

200

00:04:32.780  -->  00:04:32.790

201

00:04:32.790  -->  00:04:34.820
it's set for high revenue you'll recall

202

00:04:34.820  -->  00:04:34.830

203

00:04:34.830  -->  00:04:37.159
that we didn't use the top tab, we

204

00:04:37.159  -->  00:04:37.169

205

00:04:37.169  -->  00:04:38.330
actually the condition and in the

206

00:04:38.330  -->  00:04:38.340

207

00:04:38.340  -->  00:04:39.920
condition you can't select a parameter

208

00:04:39.920  -->  00:04:39.930

209

00:04:39.930  -->  00:04:40.610
here.

210

00:04:40.610  -->  00:04:40.620

211

00:04:40.620  -->  00:04:42.590
So what we need to do is we need to

212

00:04:42.590  -->  00:04:42.600

213

00:04:42.600  -->  00:04:44.120
create a formula. And the formulas here

214

00:04:44.120  -->  00:04:44.130

215

00:04:44.130  -->  00:04:46.040
are very simple so just make sure you

216

00:04:46.040  -->  00:04:46.050

217

00:04:46.050  -->  00:04:49.159
don't type in if or anything like

218

00:04:49.159  -->  00:04:49.169

219

00:04:49.169  -->  00:04:50.600
that, because that will just complicate the

220

00:04:50.600  -->  00:04:50.610

221

00:04:50.610  -->  00:04:53.150
form or what you need to put in here is

222

00:04:53.150  -->  00:04:53.160

223

00:04:53.160  -->  00:04:55.909
expression that you would normally put

224

00:04:55.909  -->  00:04:55.919

225

00:04:55.919  -->  00:04:57.350
inside and if. So whatever you would

226

00:04:57.350  -->  00:04:57.360

227

00:04:57.360  -->  00:05:00.020
normally put in here, that's what you

228

00:05:00.020  -->  00:05:00.030

229

00:05:00.030  -->  00:05:01.610
need to type in the formula and it's

230

00:05:01.610  -->  00:05:01.620

231

00:05:01.620  -->  00:05:04.940
like a specific thing how these

232

00:05:04.940  -->  00:05:04.950

233

00:05:04.950  -->  00:05:07.310
conditions inside sets work. So let's

234

00:05:07.310  -->  00:05:07.320

235

00:05:07.320  -->  00:05:13.400
type it in. We want to check that 2015, let's

236

00:05:13.400  -->  00:05:13.410

237

00:05:13.410  -->  00:05:17.600
type in revenue, better 2015 revenue is

238

00:05:17.600  -->  00:05:17.610

239

00:05:17.610  -->  00:05:21.770
greater than revenue cut off and you'll

240

00:05:21.770  -->  00:05:21.780

241

00:05:21.780  -->  00:05:23.779
see that it errors out right away for us

242

00:05:23.779  -->  00:05:23.789

243

00:05:23.789  -->  00:05:25.580
because I didn't put an aggregation.

244

00:05:25.580  -->  00:05:25.590

245

00:05:25.590  -->  00:05:28.640
Let's put an aggregation here, because it

246

00:05:28.640  -->  00:05:28.650

247

00:05:28.650  -->  00:05:31.730
doesn't really matter for us in this

248

00:05:31.730  -->  00:05:31.740

249

00:05:31.740  -->  00:05:33.740
particular case for us because we're

250

00:05:33.740  -->  00:05:33.750

251

00:05:33.750  -->  00:05:36.770
working this set is created the most

252

00:05:36.770  -->  00:05:36.780

253

00:05:36.780  -->  00:05:39.800
granular level at the level of ID. This

254

00:05:39.800  -->  00:05:39.810

255

00:05:39.810  -->  00:05:41.719
aggregation will be equal to the value

256

00:05:41.719  -->  00:05:41.729

257

00:05:41.729  -->  00:05:44.540
under under lying it but in other cases

258

00:05:44.540  -->  00:05:44.550

259

00:05:44.550  -->  00:05:46.640
you will need an aggregation so that's

260

00:05:46.640  -->  00:05:46.650

261

00:05:46.650  -->  00:05:48.860
why it's asking for one and you don't

262

00:05:48.860  -->  00:05:48.870

263

00:05:48.870  -->  00:05:50.870
need an aggregation for parameter so

264

00:05:50.870  -->  00:05:50.880

265

00:05:50.880  -->  00:05:52.129
once you click apply,

266

00:05:52.129  -->  00:05:52.139

267

00:05:52.139  -->  00:05:55.129
you've got that set modified and if we

268

00:05:55.129  -->  00:05:55.139

269

00:05:55.139  -->  00:05:57.170
do the revenue cut off and we show

270

00:05:57.170  -->  00:05:57.180

271

00:05:57.180  -->  00:06:00.050
proper control. Now if we move it around, as

272

00:06:00.050  -->  00:06:00.060

273

00:06:00.060  -->  00:06:02.120
you can see our visualization adjusts.

274

00:06:02.120  -->  00:06:02.130

275

00:06:02.130  -->  00:06:04.279
That's perfect, that's exactly what we

276

00:06:04.279  -->  00:06:04.289

277

00:06:04.289  -->  00:06:04.940
want

278

00:06:04.940  -->  00:06:04.950

279

00:06:04.950  -->  00:06:08.659
and finally what we want is a parameter

280

00:06:08.659  -->  00:06:08.669

281

00:06:08.669  -->  00:06:14.600
for our expenses. So let's edit the set

282

00:06:14.600  -->  00:06:14.610

283

00:06:14.610  -->  00:06:16.490
here and by the way you might want to

284

00:06:16.490  -->  00:06:16.500

285

00:06:16.500  -->  00:06:18.500
pause this video just to practice and do

286

00:06:18.500  -->  00:06:18.510

287

00:06:18.510  -->  00:06:21.140
it yourself and see how I did it but

288

00:06:21.140  -->  00:06:21.150

289

00:06:21.150  -->  00:06:23.870
otherwise all we have to do is just type

290

00:06:23.870  -->  00:06:23.880

291

00:06:23.880  -->  00:06:29.029
in sum and then expenses 2015. This time

292

00:06:29.029  -->  00:06:29.039

293

00:06:29.039  -->  00:06:31.790
is gonna have to be of course less

294

00:06:31.790  -->  00:06:31.800

295

00:06:31.800  -->  00:06:32.600
than

296

00:06:32.600  -->  00:06:32.610

297

00:06:32.610  -->  00:06:36.320
expenses cut off and if we click apply, click

298

00:06:36.320  -->  00:06:36.330

299

00:06:36.330  -->  00:06:40.459
OK and then we show parameter control, now

300

00:06:40.459  -->  00:06:40.469

301

00:06:40.469  -->  00:06:42.920
if we talk about this one as you can see

302

00:06:42.920  -->  00:06:42.930

303

00:06:42.930  -->  00:06:45.200
once again we're changing our

304

00:06:45.200  -->  00:06:45.210

305

00:06:45.210  -->  00:06:48.290
visualization on the fly which is very

306

00:06:48.290  -->  00:06:48.300

307

00:06:48.300  -->  00:06:50.659
very powerful. So that's all, that's how

308

00:06:50.659  -->  00:06:50.669

309

00:06:50.669  -->  00:06:52.969
you create parameters to control your

310

00:06:52.969  -->  00:06:52.979

311

00:06:52.979  -->  00:06:56.540
sets as you can see it's a useful tool

312

00:06:56.540  -->  00:06:56.550

313

00:06:56.550  -->  00:06:58.850
that you now have in your arsenal

314

00:06:58.850  -->  00:06:58.860

315

00:06:58.860  -->  00:07:01.070
we're working with Tableau and in the

316

00:07:01.070  -->  00:07:01.080

317

00:07:01.080  -->  00:07:02.990
next tutorial we're going to finally

318

00:07:02.990  -->  00:07:03.000

319

00:07:03.000  -->  00:07:04.760
take it to the next level.

320

00:07:04.760  -->  00:07:04.770

321

00:07:04.770  -->  00:07:06.529
We're going to put all this together and

322

00:07:06.529  -->  00:07:06.539

323

00:07:06.539  -->  00:07:10.700
create a wonderful-looking dashboard and

324

00:07:10.700  -->  00:07:10.710

325

00:07:10.710  -->  00:07:12.080
I look forward to seeing you next time.

326

00:07:12.080  -->  00:07:12.090

327

00:07:12.090  -->  00:07:18.439
Until then, happy analyzing.
