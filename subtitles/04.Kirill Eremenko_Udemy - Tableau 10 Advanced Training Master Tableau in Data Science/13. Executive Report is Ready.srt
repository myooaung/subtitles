00:00:01,689  -->  00:00:07,200
Welcome back to the advanced course on

2

00:00:07,200  -->  00:00:07,210

3

00:00:07,210  -->  00:00:09,539
Tableau and in today's tutorial

4

00:00:09,539  -->  00:00:09,549

5

00:00:09,549  -->  00:00:11,819
finally the executive report is ready

6

00:00:11,819  -->  00:00:11,829

7

00:00:11,829  -->  00:00:14,129
and we're going to go through it.

8

00:00:14,129  -->  00:00:14,139

9

00:00:14,139  -->  00:00:15,930
However before we do, I would like to ask

10

00:00:15,930  -->  00:00:15,940

11

00:00:15,940  -->  00:00:17,519
you for a favor.

12

00:00:17,519  -->  00:00:17,529

13

00:00:17,529  -->  00:00:18,630
I know we're not finished with the

14

00:00:18,630  -->  00:00:18,640

15

00:00:18,640  -->  00:00:20,760
course yet but I would like to ask you

16

00:00:20,760  -->  00:00:20,770

17

00:00:20,770  -->  00:00:21,750
to leave a review.

18

00:00:21,750  -->  00:00:21,760

19

00:00:21,760  -->  00:00:23,220
It's very easy to do you just need to

20

00:00:23,220  -->  00:00:23,230

21

00:00:23,230  -->  00:00:25,800
click this button up in the top right

22

00:00:25,800  -->  00:00:25,810

23

00:00:25,810  -->  00:00:28,050
corner of your screen and select the

24

00:00:28,050  -->  00:00:28,060

25

00:00:28,060  -->  00:00:29,640
number of stars you think the course

26

00:00:29,640  -->  00:00:29,650

27

00:00:29,650  -->  00:00:31,980
deserves and perhaps type up a short

28

00:00:31,980  -->  00:00:31,990

29

00:00:31,990  -->  00:00:34,439
message for me if you like, if not,

30

00:00:34,439  -->  00:00:34,449

31

00:00:34,449  -->  00:00:36,239
select a number of stars will be

32

00:00:36,239  -->  00:00:36,249

33

00:00:36,249  -->  00:00:38,250
totally sufficient. I'll be really happy if

34

00:00:38,250  -->  00:00:38,260

35

00:00:38,260  -->  00:00:39,899
you can do that and the reason I'm

36

00:00:39,899  -->  00:00:39,909

37

00:00:39,909  -->  00:00:41,220
asking you now is that although we

38

00:00:41,220  -->  00:00:41,230

39

00:00:41,230  -->  00:00:43,319
haven't finished with the course yet, a lot of

40

00:00:43,319  -->  00:00:43,329

41

00:00:43,329  -->  00:00:45,059
students for whatever reasons don't get

42

00:00:45,059  -->  00:00:45,069

43

00:00:45,069  -->  00:00:46,229
to the very end of the course and

44

00:00:46,229  -->  00:00:46,239

45

00:00:46,239  -->  00:00:48,270
therefore forget to leave a review but

46

00:00:48,270  -->  00:00:48,280

47

00:00:48,280  -->  00:00:49,349
at the same time I would really

48

00:00:49,349  -->  00:00:49,359

49

00:00:49,359  -->  00:00:51,299
appreciate if you could give me some

50

00:00:51,299  -->  00:00:51,309

51

00:00:51,309  -->  00:00:53,790
feedback on how you felt the course went,

52

00:00:53,790  -->  00:00:53,800

53

00:00:53,800  -->  00:00:55,469
how I went for the materials and more

54

00:00:55,469  -->  00:00:55,479

55

00:00:55,479  -->  00:00:57,569
importantly your review will help other

56

00:00:57,569  -->  00:00:57,579

57

00:00:57,579  -->  00:00:59,579
students decide for themselves whether

58

00:00:59,579  -->  00:00:59,589

59

00:00:59,589  -->  00:01:01,139
this course is where their while or not.

60

00:01:01,139  -->  00:01:01,149

61

00:01:01,149  -->  00:01:02,910
So I would be very happy if you could do

62

00:01:02,910  -->  00:01:02,920

63

00:01:02,920  -->  00:01:04,860
that for me today and now let's get on

64

00:01:04,860  -->  00:01:04,870

65

00:01:04,870  -->  00:01:06,840
with the show. So I'm going to jump into

66

00:01:06,840  -->  00:01:06,850

67

00:01:06,850  -->  00:01:08,490
full-screen mode just like you would

68

00:01:08,490  -->  00:01:08,500

69

00:01:08,500  -->  00:01:10,530
during a presentation and you do that by

70

00:01:10,530  -->  00:01:10,540

71

00:01:10,540  -->  00:01:14,280
clicking f7 and so on this first page of

72

00:01:14,280  -->  00:01:14,290

73

00:01:14,290  -->  00:01:17,400
our storyline what we have is a summary.

74

00:01:17,400  -->  00:01:17,410

75

00:01:17,410  -->  00:01:19,590
Here we've got the five machines that we

76

00:01:19,590  -->  00:01:19,600

77

00:01:19,600  -->  00:01:22,020
were analyzing. A reclaimer one and two

78

00:01:22,020  -->  00:01:22,030

79

00:01:22,030  -->  00:01:26,010
and stack reclaim is 14a and 6 and we

80

00:01:26,010  -->  00:01:26,020

81

00:01:26,020  -->  00:01:28,110
are comparing the idle capacity in

82

00:01:28,110  -->  00:01:28,120

83

00:01:28,120  -->  00:01:30,900
percentage terms to the threshold of ten

84

00:01:30,900  -->  00:01:30,910

85

00:01:30,910  -->  00:01:33,000
percent and also what we're talking

86

00:01:33,000  -->  00:01:33,010

87

00:01:33,010  -->  00:01:35,820
about is the 8-hour moving average. So

88

00:01:35,820  -->  00:01:35,830

89

00:01:35,830  -->  00:01:38,370
what would you do with this first slide?

90

00:01:38,370  -->  00:01:38,380

91

00:01:38,380  -->  00:01:40,230
Well sometimes during the presentation,

92

00:01:40,230  -->  00:01:40,240

93

00:01:40,240  -->  00:01:42,090
this would be sufficient for you to

94

00:01:42,090  -->  00:01:42,100

95

00:01:42,100  -->  00:01:43,290
present your findings.

96

00:01:43,290  -->  00:01:43,300

97

00:01:43,300  -->  00:01:45,750
Perhaps you would just talk about what

98

00:01:45,750  -->  00:01:45,760

99

00:01:45,760  -->  00:01:48,000
you were able to investigate through

100

00:01:48,000  -->  00:01:48,010

101

00:01:48,010  -->  00:01:50,310
your data mining process and that

102

00:01:50,310  -->  00:01:50,320

103

00:01:50,320  -->  00:01:52,710
would be sufficient information for the

104

00:01:52,710  -->  00:01:52,720

105

00:01:52,720  -->  00:01:55,080
executives to proceed with the business

106

00:01:55,080  -->  00:01:55,090

107

00:01:55,090  -->  00:01:57,390
decisions. Here you would highlight that

108

00:01:57,390  -->  00:01:57,400

109

00:01:57,400  -->  00:02:00,000
machine number one has exceeded the

110

00:02:00,000  -->  00:02:00,010

111

00:02:00,010  -->  00:02:01,740
threshold several times and it does

112

00:02:01,740  -->  00:02:01,750

113

00:02:01,750  -->  00:02:03,420
require maintenance. Also, you would

114

00:02:03,420  -->  00:02:03,430

115

00:02:03,430  -->  00:02:05,790
identify the upward trend that you were

116

00:02:05,790  -->  00:02:05,800

117

00:02:05,800  -->  00:02:08,969
able to establish. Next you'd say that

118

00:02:08,969  -->  00:02:08,979

119

00:02:08,979  -->  00:02:11,100
machine RL2 is performing fine

120

00:02:11,100  -->  00:02:11,110

121

00:02:11,110  -->  00:02:13,410
and does not require any service add to

122

00:02:13,410  -->  00:02:13,420

123

00:02:13,420  -->  00:02:15,360
the stage. Machine

124

00:02:15,360  -->  00:02:15,370

125

00:02:15,370  -->  00:02:17,130
SR1 is also performing fine and

126

00:02:17,130  -->  00:02:17,140

127

00:02:17,140  -->  00:02:18,630
perhaps they would ask a question about

128

00:02:18,630  -->  00:02:18,640

129

00:02:18,640  -->  00:02:21,330
what this gap means and you would easily

130

00:02:21,330  -->  00:02:21,340

131

00:02:21,340  -->  00:02:22,979
explain it because we do know that this

132

00:02:22,979  -->  00:02:22,989

133

00:02:22,989  -->  00:02:25,410
gap was attributed to the fact that the

134

00:02:25,410  -->  00:02:25,420

135

00:02:25,420  -->  00:02:27,570
machine was working on another job. Then

136

00:02:27,570  -->  00:02:27,580

137

00:02:27,580  -->  00:02:30,089
you would highlight this trend in a

138

00:02:30,089  -->  00:02:30,099

139

00:02:30,099  -->  00:02:33,149
machine 4A saying that this is a very

140

00:02:33,149  -->  00:02:33,159

141

00:02:33,159  -->  00:02:35,759
important finding and even though the

142

00:02:35,759  -->  00:02:35,769

143

00:02:35,769  -->  00:02:37,410
machine does not exceed the ten percent

144

00:02:37,410  -->  00:02:37,420

145

00:02:37,420  -->  00:02:39,180
threshold and any given point in time

146

00:02:39,180  -->  00:02:39,190

147

00:02:39,190  -->  00:02:42,119
what in reality is happening, it is

148

00:02:42,119  -->  00:02:42,129

149

00:02:42,129  -->  00:02:45,600
coming near a very dangerous point in its

150

00:02:45,600  -->  00:02:45,610

151

00:02:45,610  -->  00:02:48,449
service life and that if a maintenance

152

00:02:48,449  -->  00:02:48,459

153

00:02:48,459  -->  00:02:50,729
is not undertaken and then it might

154

00:02:50,729  -->  00:02:50,739

155

00:02:50,739  -->  00:02:52,289
break down in the coming months. So

156

00:02:52,289  -->  00:02:52,299

157

00:02:52,299  -->  00:02:54,030
basically you're predicting ahead of

158

00:02:54,030  -->  00:02:54,040

159

00:02:54,040  -->  00:02:57,660
time using data that this machine might

160

00:02:57,660  -->  00:02:57,670

161

00:02:57,670  -->  00:03:00,030
break down in the next week or so and

162

00:03:00,030  -->  00:03:00,040

163

00:03:00,040  -->  00:03:01,890
you can already tell that just by

164

00:03:01,890  -->  00:03:01,900

165

00:03:01,900  -->  00:03:04,170
looking at this trend, something very

166

00:03:04,170  -->  00:03:04,180

167

00:03:04,180  -->  00:03:05,670
interesting, something that you would not

168

00:03:05,670  -->  00:03:05,680

169

00:03:05,680  -->  00:03:08,430
be able to find unless you looked at the

170

00:03:08,430  -->  00:03:08,440

171

00:03:08,440  -->  00:03:11,789
data. So this in itself demonstrates the

172

00:03:11,789  -->  00:03:11,799

173

00:03:11,799  -->  00:03:14,069
power of data mining and finally you

174

00:03:14,069  -->  00:03:14,079

175

00:03:14,079  -->  00:03:16,319
talk about machine SR6 and you'll say that

176

00:03:16,319  -->  00:03:16,329

177

00:03:16,329  -->  00:03:18,839
it did exceed the threshold but from

178

00:03:18,839  -->  00:03:18,849

179

00:03:18,849  -->  00:03:21,240
your further investigations into the

180

00:03:21,240  -->  00:03:21,250

181

00:03:21,250  -->  00:03:25,140
data it appears that this increase does

182

00:03:25,140  -->  00:03:25,150

183

00:03:25,150  -->  00:03:27,990
look like a planned increase. So it's a

184

00:03:27,990  -->  00:03:28,000

185

00:03:28,000  -->  00:03:30,240
sacrifice of visualization to increase

186

00:03:30,240  -->  00:03:30,250

187

00:03:30,250  -->  00:03:31,860
the utilization of machine RL2

188

00:03:31,860  -->  00:03:31,870

189

00:03:31,870  -->  00:03:35,069
because they are on one line. So and from

190

00:03:35,069  -->  00:03:35,079

191

00:03:35,079  -->  00:03:37,080
there perhaps you would want to still

192

00:03:37,080  -->  00:03:37,090

193

00:03:37,090  -->  00:03:39,449
published this report to let's say

194

00:03:39,449  -->  00:03:39,459

195

00:03:39,459  -->  00:03:41,460
Tableau server for the executives to

196

00:03:41,460  -->  00:03:41,470

197

00:03:41,470  -->  00:03:43,830
explore at their own leisure and that is

198

00:03:43,830  -->  00:03:43,840

199

00:03:43,840  -->  00:03:46,500
why we have the rest of these pages in

200

00:03:46,500  -->  00:03:46,510

201

00:03:46,510  -->  00:03:47,939
our storyline. So let's go through them

202

00:03:47,939  -->  00:03:47,949

203

00:03:47,949  -->  00:03:51,180
next you move on to the reclaimer so you

204

00:03:51,180  -->  00:03:51,190

205

00:03:51,190  -->  00:03:52,860
want to separate reclaimers from stacker

206

00:03:52,860  -->  00:03:52,870

207

00:03:52,870  -->  00:03:55,800
reclaimers in your storyline and you have

208

00:03:55,800  -->  00:03:55,810

209

00:03:55,810  -->  00:03:58,080
this traditional slide. Here you talk

210

00:03:58,080  -->  00:03:58,090

211

00:03:58,090  -->  00:03:59,970
about reclaimer one, so we've got a map

212

00:03:59,970  -->  00:03:59,980

213

00:03:59,980  -->  00:04:01,650
a very nice and convenient map over here

214

00:04:01,650  -->  00:04:01,660

215

00:04:01,660  -->  00:04:04,409
which tells us where exactly reclaimer

216

00:04:04,409  -->  00:04:04,419

217

00:04:04,419  -->  00:04:06,089
one is located and you've got the

218

00:04:06,089  -->  00:04:06,099

219

00:04:06,099  -->  00:04:08,699
transfer and you've got some verbiage or

220

00:04:08,699  -->  00:04:08,709

221

00:04:08,709  -->  00:04:10,710
some text explaining exactly what

222

00:04:10,710  -->  00:04:10,720

223

00:04:10,720  -->  00:04:12,869
happened to reclaim one. Now I won't go

224

00:04:12,869  -->  00:04:12,879

225

00:04:12,879  -->  00:04:14,939
through this text right now, won't read

226

00:04:14,939  -->  00:04:14,949

227

00:04:14,949  -->  00:04:17,189
through it but feel free to pause the

228

00:04:17,189  -->  00:04:17,199

229

00:04:17,199  -->  00:04:18,900
video if you'd like to read through this

230

00:04:18,900  -->  00:04:18,910

231

00:04:18,910  -->  00:04:21,479
text. This is my interpretation of what i

232

00:04:21,479  -->  00:04:21,489

233

00:04:21,489  -->  00:04:24,510
found in the data. Also, I have added a disclaimer

234

00:04:24,510  -->  00:04:24,520

235

00:04:24,520  -->  00:04:27,360
here because all of these findings they

236

00:04:27,360  -->  00:04:27,370

237

00:04:27,370  -->  00:04:28,830
are completely not really

238

00:04:28,830  -->  00:04:28,840

239

00:04:28,840  -->  00:04:32,580
related to DBCT. This is a mock-up

240

00:04:32,580  -->  00:04:32,590

241

00:04:32,590  -->  00:04:35,490
data set just to practice our skills in

242

00:04:35,490  -->  00:04:35,500

243

00:04:35,500  -->  00:04:37,950
Tableau, so just making sure that anybody

244

00:04:37,950  -->  00:04:37,960

245

00:04:37,960  -->  00:04:40,020
was reading this report is

246

00:04:40,020  -->  00:04:40,030

247

00:04:40,030  -->  00:04:42,420
definitely aware of that. So then we

248

00:04:42,420  -->  00:04:42,430

249

00:04:42,430  -->  00:04:44,820
move onto RL2, so you can see how the

250

00:04:44,820  -->  00:04:44,830

251

00:04:44,830  -->  00:04:46,710
highlighting changed and once again the

252

00:04:46,710  -->  00:04:46,720

253

00:04:46,720  -->  00:04:49,320
text changed. Then we move onto stacker

254

00:04:49,320  -->  00:04:49,330

255

00:04:49,330  -->  00:04:51,810
reclaimers. These are different machines

256

00:04:51,810  -->  00:04:51,820

257

00:04:51,820  -->  00:04:53,460
that can perform two types of tasks

258

00:04:53,460  -->  00:04:53,470

259

00:04:53,470  -->  00:04:55,890
by the way that's what the rails would look

260

00:04:55,890  -->  00:04:55,900

261

00:04:55,900  -->  00:05:00,780
like at a coal terminal then we talk

262

00:05:00,780  -->  00:05:00,790

263

00:05:00,790  -->  00:05:02,430
about stacker reclaimer one,

264

00:05:02,430  -->  00:05:02,440

265

00:05:02,440  -->  00:05:06,210
stacker reclaimer 4a and finally stacker

266

00:05:06,210  -->  00:05:06,220

267

00:05:06,220  -->  00:05:10,469
reclaimer 6. So it is a bit different

268

00:05:10,469  -->  00:05:10,479

269

00:05:10,479  -->  00:05:12,840
this type of presentation it is a bit

270

00:05:12,840  -->  00:05:12,850

271

00:05:12,850  -->  00:05:14,580
different to what we are used to

272

00:05:14,580  -->  00:05:14,590

273

00:05:14,590  -->  00:05:17,969
normally I am a strong advocate of just

274

00:05:17,969  -->  00:05:17,979

275

00:05:17,979  -->  00:05:20,580
pictures, just images, just graphs and so

276

00:05:20,580  -->  00:05:20,590

277

00:05:20,590  -->  00:05:22,770
you say the text you are the presenter

278

00:05:22,770  -->  00:05:22,780

279

00:05:22,780  -->  00:05:24,960
you are the focus of the attention of

280

00:05:24,960  -->  00:05:24,970

281

00:05:24,970  -->  00:05:25,980
your audience

282

00:05:25,980  -->  00:05:25,990

283

00:05:25,990  -->  00:05:27,810
the slides are there just to assist you

284

00:05:27,810  -->  00:05:27,820

285

00:05:27,820  -->  00:05:30,900
but when would you write up so much text

286

00:05:30,900  -->  00:05:30,910

287

00:05:30,910  -->  00:05:32,730
you would write up so much text in cases

288

00:05:32,730  -->  00:05:32,740

289

00:05:32,740  -->  00:05:35,490
when you are letting your audience

290

00:05:35,490  -->  00:05:35,500

291

00:05:35,500  -->  00:05:37,770
autonomously go through your report and

292

00:05:37,770  -->  00:05:37,780

293

00:05:37,780  -->  00:05:39,420
that is in this case if you're

294

00:05:39,420  -->  00:05:39,430

295

00:05:39,430  -->  00:05:41,310
publishing it to Tableau server and you

296

00:05:41,310  -->  00:05:41,320

297

00:05:41,320  -->  00:05:43,500
want to the executives to be able to

298

00:05:43,500  -->  00:05:43,510

299

00:05:43,510  -->  00:05:45,870
later go through this report on at their

300

00:05:45,870  -->  00:05:45,880

301

00:05:45,880  -->  00:05:48,510
own ledger and read what you had to say

302

00:05:48,510  -->  00:05:48,520

303

00:05:48,520  -->  00:05:51,300
sometimes sometimes you are required to

304

00:05:51,300  -->  00:05:51,310

305

00:05:51,310  -->  00:05:52,710
create reports that reports like that.

306

00:05:52,710  -->  00:05:52,720

307

00:05:52,720  -->  00:05:54,390
They can be in PowerPoint, they can be in

308

00:05:54,390  -->  00:05:54,400

309

00:05:54,400  -->  00:05:56,760
Tableau, they can be in other systems,

310

00:05:56,760  -->  00:05:56,770

311

00:05:56,770  -->  00:05:59,159
they can be online and there will be

312

00:05:59,159  -->  00:05:59,169

313

00:05:59,169  -->  00:06:00,930
times when you will be required to write

314

00:06:00,930  -->  00:06:00,940

315

00:06:00,940  -->  00:06:03,270
up text so it is also a good skill to

316

00:06:03,270  -->  00:06:03,280

317

00:06:03,280  -->  00:06:03,960
have.

318

00:06:03,960  -->  00:06:03,970

319

00:06:03,970  -->  00:06:05,490
So I really hope that you enjoyed this

320

00:06:05,490  -->  00:06:05,500

321

00:06:05,500  -->  00:06:07,529
section and picked up a lot of great

322

00:06:07,529  -->  00:06:07,539

323

00:06:07,539  -->  00:06:09,570
knowledge and skills and just as a quick

324

00:06:09,570  -->  00:06:09,580

325

00:06:09,580  -->  00:06:11,610
reminder, please leave a review for this

326

00:06:11,610  -->  00:06:11,620

327

00:06:11,620  -->  00:06:13,620
course if you have enjoyed the materials

328

00:06:13,620  -->  00:06:13,630

329

00:06:13,630  -->  00:06:15,779
so far and I look forward to seeing you

330

00:06:15,779  -->  00:06:15,789

331

00:06:15,789  -->  00:06:21,660
in the next section.
