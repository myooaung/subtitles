00:00:05.500  -->  00:00:07.519
Welcome back to the advanced course in

3

00:00:07.519  -->  00:00:07.529

4

00:00:07.529  -->  00:00:09.650
Tableau. This is Kirill Eremenko and I'm

5

00:00:09.650  -->  00:00:09.660

6

00:00:09.660  -->  00:00:12.230
super excited to have you here and in

7

00:00:12.230  -->  00:00:12.240

8

00:00:12.240  -->  00:00:13.370
the previous tutorial we talked about

9

00:00:13.370  -->  00:00:13.380

10

00:00:13.380  -->  00:00:15.980
groups we found out why we need to use

11

00:00:15.980  -->  00:00:15.990

12

00:00:15.990  -->  00:00:18.380
them and when we can use them and today

13

00:00:18.380  -->  00:00:18.390

14

00:00:18.390  -->  00:00:20.570
we're going to talk about sets and right

15

00:00:20.570  -->  00:00:20.580

16

00:00:20.580  -->  00:00:22.040
off the bat, I wanted to mention an

17

00:00:22.040  -->  00:00:22.050

18

00:00:22.050  -->  00:00:23.900
important thing and that is that sets

19

00:00:23.900  -->  00:00:23.910

20

00:00:23.910  -->  00:00:26.089
are not groups. Even though they might

21

00:00:26.089  -->  00:00:26.099

22

00:00:26.099  -->  00:00:28.550
appear to be similar, they have different

23

00:00:28.550  -->  00:00:28.560

24

00:00:28.560  -->  00:00:30.950
use cases and they work differently and

25

00:00:30.950  -->  00:00:30.960

26

00:00:30.960  -->  00:00:33.410
quite a lot of people get them confused

27

00:00:33.410  -->  00:00:33.420

28

00:00:33.420  -->  00:00:35.389
and mixed up and don't really understand

29

00:00:35.389  -->  00:00:35.399

30

00:00:35.399  -->  00:00:36.830
what the differences are even though

31

00:00:36.830  -->  00:00:36.840

32

00:00:36.840  -->  00:00:39.020
they're very trivial differences but

33

00:00:39.020  -->  00:00:39.030

34

00:00:39.030  -->  00:00:39.860
don't worry

35

00:00:39.860  -->  00:00:39.870

36

00:00:39.870  -->  00:00:42.680
in this section I will make sure that by

37

00:00:42.680  -->  00:00:42.690

38

00:00:42.690  -->  00:00:44.810
the end of it you are a hundred percent

39

00:00:44.810  -->  00:00:44.820

40

00:00:44.820  -->  00:00:47.959
confident what the differences are, how

41

00:00:47.959  -->  00:00:47.969

42

00:00:47.969  -->  00:00:49.910
they work differently and when you would

43

00:00:49.910  -->  00:00:49.920

44

00:00:49.920  -->  00:00:51.650
use a group and when you would use a set

45

00:00:51.650  -->  00:00:51.660

46

00:00:51.660  -->  00:00:54.680
so let's dive straight in. There are two

47

00:00:54.680  -->  00:00:54.690

48

00:00:54.690  -->  00:00:57.319
ways of creating sets in Tableau and one

49

00:00:57.319  -->  00:00:57.329

50

00:00:57.329  -->  00:00:59.330
is a static way the other one is a

51

00:00:59.330  -->  00:00:59.340

52

00:00:59.340  -->  00:01:01.130
dynamic way. In today's tutorial we're

53

00:01:01.130  -->  00:01:01.140

54

00:01:01.140  -->  00:01:02.990
going to look at the static way of

55

00:01:02.990  -->  00:01:03.000

56

00:01:03.000  -->  00:01:05.390
creating sets, so here we've got our

57

00:01:05.390  -->  00:01:05.400

58

00:01:05.400  -->  00:01:08.420
chart of industries and as you recall we

59

00:01:08.420  -->  00:01:08.430

60

00:01:08.430  -->  00:01:11.179
grouped our industry so we created a few

61

00:01:11.179  -->  00:01:11.189

62

00:01:11.189  -->  00:01:12.770
groups of industries. Let's go ahead and

63

00:01:12.770  -->  00:01:12.780

64

00:01:12.780  -->  00:01:14.660
look at those groups, if we right-click

65

00:01:14.660  -->  00:01:14.670

66

00:01:14.670  -->  00:01:17.510
and click edit group here you'll see

67

00:01:17.510  -->  00:01:17.520

68

00:01:17.520  -->  00:01:19.940
that we have two groups. We have a group

69

00:01:19.940  -->  00:01:19.950

70

00:01:19.950  -->  00:01:21.649
for information technology and we have a

71

00:01:21.649  -->  00:01:21.659

72

00:01:21.659  -->  00:01:25.100
group for construction room and and

73

00:01:25.100  -->  00:01:25.110

74

00:01:25.110  -->  00:01:26.660
environmental services so this one we

75

00:01:26.660  -->  00:01:26.670

76

00:01:26.670  -->  00:01:29.179
created just to prove, as a proof of

77

00:01:29.179  -->  00:01:29.189

78

00:01:29.189  -->  00:01:31.429
concept so let's get rid of that one and we'll

79

00:01:31.429  -->  00:01:31.439

80

00:01:31.439  -->  00:01:33.770
click ungroup, we'll click apply

81

00:01:33.770  -->  00:01:33.780

82

00:01:33.780  -->  00:01:35.690
so just as a quick reminder what is

83

00:01:35.690  -->  00:01:35.700

84

00:01:35.700  -->  00:01:37.520
going on in Tableau right now.

85

00:01:37.520  -->  00:01:37.530

86

00:01:37.530  -->  00:01:40.789
Well what we did by creating this group

87

00:01:40.789  -->  00:01:40.799

88

00:01:40.799  -->  00:01:42.800
is we changed the metadata. We can change

89

00:01:42.800  -->  00:01:42.810

90

00:01:42.810  -->  00:01:45.380
the data itself but we changed how

91

00:01:45.380  -->  00:01:45.390

92

00:01:45.390  -->  00:01:49.010
Tableau perceives the data and why using

93

00:01:49.010  -->  00:01:49.020

94

00:01:49.020  -->  00:01:50.929
this field industry and then group in

95

00:01:50.929  -->  00:01:50.939

96

00:01:50.939  -->  00:01:52.969
brackets what we're doing is we're

97

00:01:52.969  -->  00:01:52.979

98

00:01:52.979  -->  00:01:55.340
telling Tableau that in that when you

99

00:01:55.340  -->  00:01:55.350

100

00:01:55.350  -->  00:01:57.859
look at the data, there is no longer

101

00:01:57.859  -->  00:01:57.869

102

00:01:57.869  -->  00:02:01.609
for there's all these four categories in

103

00:02:01.609  -->  00:02:01.619

104

00:02:01.619  -->  00:02:04.819
the in the industry they don't exist

105

00:02:04.819  -->  00:02:04.829

106

00:02:04.829  -->  00:02:05.600
anymore.

107

00:02:05.600  -->  00:02:05.610

108

00:02:05.610  -->  00:02:08.449
We only have one new category to replace

109

00:02:08.449  -->  00:02:08.459

110

00:02:08.459  -->  00:02:09.380
them which is called information

111

00:02:09.380  -->  00:02:09.390

112

00:02:09.390  -->  00:02:11.029
technology so basically any records that

113

00:02:11.029  -->  00:02:11.039

114

00:02:11.039  -->  00:02:13.110
used to fall in either of these

115

00:02:13.110  -->  00:02:13.120

116

00:02:13.120  -->  00:02:15.059
now all fall under information

117

00:02:15.059  -->  00:02:15.069

118

00:02:15.069  -->  00:02:17.460
technology. Alright so that's how a group

119

00:02:17.460  -->  00:02:17.470

120

00:02:17.470  -->  00:02:19.949
works, now let's say you don't actually

121

00:02:19.949  -->  00:02:19.959

122

00:02:19.959  -->  00:02:24.420
want to put all these four groups in you

123

00:02:24.420  -->  00:02:24.430

124

00:02:24.430  -->  00:02:25.740
don't wanna merge them together. So

125

00:02:25.740  -->  00:02:25.750

126

00:02:25.750  -->  00:02:27.240
basically group merge them together you

127

00:02:27.240  -->  00:02:27.250

128

00:02:27.250  -->  00:02:29.220
don't want to merge them but you do want

129

00:02:29.220  -->  00:02:29.230

130

00:02:29.230  -->  00:02:32.100
to signify that they are somehow related

131

00:02:32.100  -->  00:02:32.110

132

00:02:32.110  -->  00:02:36.899
and be able to quickly just refer to

133

00:02:36.899  -->  00:02:36.909

134

00:02:36.909  -->  00:02:38.819
them in your analysis and a simple

135

00:02:38.819  -->  00:02:38.829

136

00:02:38.829  -->  00:02:41.640
example is let's say in this chart you

137

00:02:41.640  -->  00:02:41.650

138

00:02:41.650  -->  00:02:45.059
want to look at them. Just filter out

139

00:02:45.059  -->  00:02:45.069

140

00:02:45.069  -->  00:02:47.130
does those specific four groups, so let's

141

00:02:47.130  -->  00:02:47.140

142

00:02:47.140  -->  00:02:51.360
rename this tab to industries group.

143

00:02:51.360  -->  00:02:51.370

144

00:02:51.370  -->  00:02:54.539
So here, this means that we will

145

00:02:54.539  -->  00:02:54.549

146

00:02:54.549  -->  00:02:57.539
look we're talking about groups and

147

00:02:57.539  -->  00:02:57.549

148

00:02:57.549  -->  00:03:01.020
let's duplicate the sheet and this one

149

00:03:01.020  -->  00:03:01.030

150

00:03:01.030  -->  00:03:06.210
we'll call it industries sets and now

151

00:03:06.210  -->  00:03:06.220

152

00:03:06.220  -->  00:03:08.880
we'll get rid of groups so we'll get rid

153

00:03:08.880  -->  00:03:08.890

154

00:03:08.890  -->  00:03:11.819
of this filled with group and we'll

155

00:03:11.819  -->  00:03:11.829

156

00:03:11.829  -->  00:03:13.440
replace it with the normal industry

157

00:03:13.440  -->  00:03:13.450

158

00:03:13.450  -->  00:03:15.180
field which doesn't have the groups

159

00:03:15.180  -->  00:03:15.190

160

00:03:15.190  -->  00:03:17.430
anymore and will order it again. So now

161

00:03:17.430  -->  00:03:17.440

162

00:03:17.440  -->  00:03:20.370
you can see we have our old fields or

163

00:03:20.370  -->  00:03:20.380

164

00:03:20.380  -->  00:03:22.620
our old categories telecommunication IT

165

00:03:22.620  -->  00:03:22.630

166

00:03:22.630  -->  00:03:26.970
services software and computer hardware.

167

00:03:26.970  -->  00:03:26.980

168

00:03:26.980  -->  00:03:28.740
Now let's say we want to look at just

169

00:03:28.740  -->  00:03:28.750

170

00:03:28.750  -->  00:03:30.300
these four, we don't look at all the

171

00:03:30.300  -->  00:03:30.310

172

00:03:30.310  -->  00:03:31.409
industry we just want to look at those

173

00:03:31.409  -->  00:03:31.419

174

00:03:31.419  -->  00:03:33.119
four. How would you go about it normally?

175

00:03:33.119  -->  00:03:33.129

176

00:03:33.129  -->  00:03:35.220
Well you take your industry field, you'll

177

00:03:35.220  -->  00:03:35.230

178

00:03:35.230  -->  00:03:38.069
hold down control, put into filter and you

179

00:03:38.069  -->  00:03:38.079

180

00:03:38.079  -->  00:03:40.559
would click none and then you would find

181

00:03:40.559  -->  00:03:40.569

182

00:03:40.569  -->  00:03:42.900
the ones you want computer hardware, IT

183

00:03:42.900  -->  00:03:42.910

184

00:03:42.910  -->  00:03:45.960
services, telecommunication and software.

185

00:03:45.960  -->  00:03:45.970

186

00:03:45.970  -->  00:03:48.330
You click ok and there you are so you

187

00:03:48.330  -->  00:03:48.340

188

00:03:48.340  -->  00:03:50.819
have those four that you were looking for.

189

00:03:50.819  -->  00:03:50.829

190

00:03:50.829  -->  00:03:53.039
Ok so that's one way to do it now let's

191

00:03:53.039  -->  00:03:53.049

192

00:03:53.049  -->  00:03:54.089
say you

193

00:03:54.089  -->  00:03:54.099

194

00:03:54.099  -->  00:03:55.140
let's say you don't want that anymore.

195

00:03:55.140  -->  00:03:55.150

196

00:03:55.150  -->  00:03:56.729
Let's say you want to look at all the

197

00:03:56.729  -->  00:03:56.739

198

00:03:56.739  -->  00:03:58.619
industries but you want to color just

199

00:03:58.619  -->  00:03:58.629

200

00:03:58.629  -->  00:04:01.890
those four alone so in order to do that

201

00:04:01.890  -->  00:04:01.900

202

00:04:01.900  -->  00:04:03.390
what you would do is you take industry

203

00:04:03.390  -->  00:04:03.400

204

00:04:03.400  -->  00:04:05.580
drag it into color. You'd go in to color

205

00:04:05.580  -->  00:04:05.590

206

00:04:05.590  -->  00:04:08.250
you go edit colors and you would get

207

00:04:08.250  -->  00:04:08.260

208

00:04:08.260  -->  00:04:10.830
take all of these and give them one

209

00:04:10.830  -->  00:04:10.840

210

00:04:10.840  -->  00:04:12.869
color and then you would find the ones

211

00:04:12.869  -->  00:04:12.879

212

00:04:12.879  -->  00:04:15.509
you're after computer hardware, ID

213

00:04:15.509  -->  00:04:15.519

214

00:04:15.519  -->  00:04:17.699
service allocation software and you give

215

00:04:17.699  -->  00:04:17.709

216

00:04:17.709  -->  00:04:19.409
a different color you click apply.

217

00:04:19.409  -->  00:04:19.419

218

00:04:19.419  -->  00:04:21.539
So there you go there highlighted for

219

00:04:21.539  -->  00:04:21.549

220

00:04:21.549  -->  00:04:23.219
you and now you can actually see them

221

00:04:23.219  -->  00:04:23.229

222

00:04:23.229  -->  00:04:25.170
and they're not merged notice that

223

00:04:25.170  -->  00:04:25.180

224

00:04:25.180  -->  00:04:26.210
they're not merged

225

00:04:26.210  -->  00:04:26.220

226

00:04:26.220  -->  00:04:27.950
what you wanted is you just wanted to

227

00:04:27.950  -->  00:04:27.960

228

00:04:27.960  -->  00:04:30.170
highlight them. Now as you can see, all

229

00:04:30.170  -->  00:04:30.180

230

00:04:30.180  -->  00:04:33.170
these processes are quite tedious and to

231

00:04:33.170  -->  00:04:33.180

232

00:04:33.180  -->  00:04:35.480
redo them every time or different charts

233

00:04:35.480  -->  00:04:35.490

234

00:04:35.490  -->  00:04:37.730
might take some someone quite a lot of

235

00:04:37.730  -->  00:04:37.740

236

00:04:37.740  -->  00:04:39.590
your time and instead of doing analysis

237

00:04:39.590  -->  00:04:39.600

238

00:04:39.600  -->  00:04:41.060
you're actually just doing this

239

00:04:41.060  -->  00:04:41.070

240

00:04:41.070  -->  00:04:43.490
repetitive task. Well in Tableau there's

241

00:04:43.490  -->  00:04:43.500

242

00:04:43.500  -->  00:04:46.640
a much faster way you can do this and so

243

00:04:46.640  -->  00:04:46.650

244

00:04:46.650  -->  00:04:48.020
that you can replicate it very quickly

245

00:04:48.020  -->  00:04:48.030

246

00:04:48.030  -->  00:04:50.930
and that is where we introduce set. So

247

00:04:50.930  -->  00:04:50.940

248

00:04:50.940  -->  00:04:52.850
let's get rid of this color from here

249

00:04:52.850  -->  00:04:52.860

250

00:04:52.860  -->  00:04:55.700
now and let's select the industries

251

00:04:55.700  -->  00:04:55.710

252

00:04:55.710  -->  00:04:57.200
that were interested in so software,

253

00:04:57.200  -->  00:04:57.210

254

00:04:57.210  -->  00:05:00.050
telecommunications, IT services and

255

00:05:00.050  -->  00:05:00.060

256

00:05:00.060  -->  00:05:02.270
computer hardware and now if you put

257

00:05:02.270  -->  00:05:02.280

258

00:05:02.280  -->  00:05:04.040
your mouse next to one of them what

259

00:05:04.040  -->  00:05:04.050

260

00:05:04.050  -->  00:05:05.930
you'll see is next to the group icon

261

00:05:05.930  -->  00:05:05.940

262

00:05:05.940  -->  00:05:08.390
you have a create set. So let's go ahead and

263

00:05:08.390  -->  00:05:08.400

264

00:05:08.400  -->  00:05:10.730
click that, create a set and let's give

265

00:05:10.730  -->  00:05:10.740

266

00:05:10.740  -->  00:05:14.030
it a name. We'll call it information

267

00:05:14.030  -->  00:05:14.040

268

00:05:14.040  -->  00:05:20.810
technology set and we'll click okay. So

269

00:05:20.810  -->  00:05:20.820

270

00:05:20.820  -->  00:05:23.060
nothing changed in our chart but what

271

00:05:23.060  -->  00:05:23.070

272

00:05:23.070  -->  00:05:25.040
you can see here down down at the bottom

273

00:05:25.040  -->  00:05:25.050

274

00:05:25.050  -->  00:05:27.830
a new tab over here. It's called sets and we

275

00:05:27.830  -->  00:05:27.840

276

00:05:27.840  -->  00:05:29.960
have an information technology set so

277

00:05:29.960  -->  00:05:29.970

278

00:05:29.970  -->  00:05:31.970
let's do the following thing. Let's take

279

00:05:31.970  -->  00:05:31.980

280

00:05:31.980  -->  00:05:34.730
this set and drag it into filters and

281

00:05:34.730  -->  00:05:34.740

282

00:05:34.740  -->  00:05:36.800
what you'll see right away is that we're

283

00:05:36.800  -->  00:05:36.810

284

00:05:36.810  -->  00:05:38.810
left with exactly the industries we're

285

00:05:38.810  -->  00:05:38.820

286

00:05:38.820  -->  00:05:39.830
interested in.

287

00:05:39.830  -->  00:05:39.840

288

00:05:39.840  -->  00:05:42.680
Ok interesting so let's take it out and

289

00:05:42.680  -->  00:05:42.690

290

00:05:42.690  -->  00:05:45.680
let's take this set and drag it on to color and

291

00:05:45.680  -->  00:05:45.690

292

00:05:45.690  -->  00:05:47.120
once again which you can see is right

293

00:05:47.120  -->  00:05:47.130

294

00:05:47.130  -->  00:05:47.960
away

295

00:05:47.960  -->  00:05:47.970

296

00:05:47.970  -->  00:05:49.820
we've got the industries that were

297

00:05:49.820  -->  00:05:49.830

298

00:05:49.830  -->  00:05:51.440
interested in they're highlighted for us

299

00:05:51.440  -->  00:05:51.450

300

00:05:51.450  -->  00:05:55.730
and in color we have this in out type of

301

00:05:55.730  -->  00:05:55.740

302

00:05:55.740  -->  00:05:59.060
field that has appeared so we click on

303

00:05:59.060  -->  00:05:59.070

304

00:05:59.070  -->  00:06:01.490
color now and click edit you'll see that

305

00:06:01.490  -->  00:06:01.500

306

00:06:01.500  -->  00:06:03.770
there's only two categories. One

307

00:06:03.770  -->  00:06:03.780

308

00:06:03.780  -->  00:06:05.840
category is in another category is out,

309

00:06:05.840  -->  00:06:05.850

310

00:06:05.850  -->  00:06:07.580
and basically what they're saying is

311

00:06:07.580  -->  00:06:07.590

312

00:06:07.590  -->  00:06:10.370
that the in category represents all

313

00:06:10.370  -->  00:06:10.380

314

00:06:10.380  -->  00:06:13.820
records that do fall into our set. The

315

00:06:13.820  -->  00:06:13.830

316

00:06:13.830  -->  00:06:16.700
way we define the set was it includes a

317

00:06:16.700  -->  00:06:16.710

318

00:06:16.710  -->  00:06:18.920
software telecommunications, IT services

319

00:06:18.920  -->  00:06:18.930

320

00:06:18.930  -->  00:06:20.510
and computer hardware. So in your record

321

00:06:20.510  -->  00:06:20.520

322

00:06:20.520  -->  00:06:23.090
that falls into that set will be in the

323

00:06:23.090  -->  00:06:23.100

324

00:06:23.100  -->  00:06:25.850
in the category, anything that doesn't fall into

325

00:06:25.850  -->  00:06:25.860

326

00:06:25.860  -->  00:06:28.130
those industries will be in the out

327

00:06:28.130  -->  00:06:28.140

328

00:06:28.140  -->  00:06:30.080
category. So now we once again you can

329

00:06:30.080  -->  00:06:30.090

330

00:06:30.090  -->  00:06:33.409
change around the colors if you like and

331

00:06:33.409  -->  00:06:33.419

332

00:06:33.419  -->  00:06:35.510
you can control them that way so that's

333

00:06:35.510  -->  00:06:35.520

334

00:06:35.520  -->  00:06:37.730
a very trivial example of using sets and

335

00:06:37.730  -->  00:06:37.740

336

00:06:37.740  -->  00:06:39.119
you can really see how quickly

337

00:06:39.119  -->  00:06:39.129

338

00:06:39.129  -->  00:06:41.639
we are able to perform analysis. Let's

339

00:06:41.639  -->  00:06:41.649

340

00:06:41.649  -->  00:06:42.719
look at another example.

341

00:06:42.719  -->  00:06:42.729

342

00:06:42.729  -->  00:06:44.579
So I'm going to create a new sheet and

343

00:06:44.579  -->  00:06:44.589

344

00:06:44.589  -->  00:06:46.619
this one we'll call growth. As you

345

00:06:46.619  -->  00:06:46.629

346

00:06:46.629  -->  00:06:49.679
remember from our challenge, the board of

347

00:06:49.679  -->  00:06:49.689

348

00:06:49.689  -->  00:06:52.079
directors want to analyze the top

349

00:06:52.079  -->  00:06:52.089

350

00:06:52.089  -->  00:06:55.679
growing companies. So let's take the

351

00:06:55.679  -->  00:06:55.689

352

00:06:55.689  -->  00:06:58.409
names of companies and we will drag them

353

00:06:58.409  -->  00:06:58.419

354

00:06:58.419  -->  00:07:01.799
into rows and now we'll take growth and

355

00:07:01.799  -->  00:07:01.809

356

00:07:01.809  -->  00:07:03.659
we'll drag it into our label or the main

357

00:07:03.659  -->  00:07:03.669

358

00:07:03.669  -->  00:07:06.869
part of our chart and we want to sort

359

00:07:06.869  -->  00:07:06.879

360

00:07:06.879  -->  00:07:10.169
this by the growth. So we want the top

361

00:07:10.169  -->  00:07:10.179

362

00:07:10.179  -->  00:07:11.790
growths at the top. So before I do that

363

00:07:11.790  -->  00:07:11.800

364

00:07:11.800  -->  00:07:14.489
i'll just change the format so you can

365

00:07:14.489  -->  00:07:14.499

366

00:07:14.499  -->  00:07:15.809
see a bit better.

367

00:07:15.809  -->  00:07:15.819

368

00:07:15.819  -->  00:07:19.169
There we go and I don't want to be bold,

369

00:07:19.169  -->  00:07:19.179

370

00:07:19.179  -->  00:07:22.769
good. Now let's sort this field name, if

371

00:07:22.769  -->  00:07:22.779

372

00:07:22.779  -->  00:07:26.429
you click on name, we could sort and we

373

00:07:26.429  -->  00:07:26.439

374

00:07:26.439  -->  00:07:29.850
click descending field growth so we do

375

00:07:29.850  -->  00:07:29.860

376

00:07:29.860  -->  00:07:32.549
want by growth 20-15 percent. It doesn't

377

00:07:32.549  -->  00:07:32.559

378

00:07:32.559  -->  00:07:34.019
matter what aggregation you choose because

379

00:07:34.019  -->  00:07:34.029

380

00:07:34.029  -->  00:07:35.850
we are looking at the most granular

381

00:07:35.850  -->  00:07:35.860

382

00:07:35.860  -->  00:07:38.939
level so the role level and therefore

383

00:07:38.939  -->  00:07:38.949

384

00:07:38.949  -->  00:07:41.219
whether we choose sum average or

385

00:07:41.219  -->  00:07:41.229

386

00:07:41.229  -->  00:07:43.919
maximum going to be the same click ok

387

00:07:43.919  -->  00:07:43.929

388

00:07:43.929  -->  00:07:46.379
and here you can see they are being sorted.

389

00:07:46.379  -->  00:07:46.389

390

00:07:46.389  -->  00:07:48.779
So now before we continue actually,

391

00:07:48.779  -->  00:07:48.789

392

00:07:48.789  -->  00:07:50.850
I wanted to give you a quick tip right

393

00:07:50.850  -->  00:07:50.860

394

00:07:50.860  -->  00:07:54.269
away so what I might put it like a

395

00:07:54.269  -->  00:07:54.279

396

00:07:54.279  -->  00:07:56.879
yellow star here because these tips are

397

00:07:56.879  -->  00:07:56.889

398

00:07:56.889  -->  00:07:58.769
very handy look like Tableau hacks that

399

00:07:58.769  -->  00:07:58.779

400

00:07:58.779  -->  00:08:01.109
will benefit you in any kind of project

401

00:08:01.109  -->  00:08:01.119

402

00:08:01.119  -->  00:08:03.600
that you do. So here what we want to do

403

00:08:03.600  -->  00:08:03.610

404

00:08:03.610  -->  00:08:06.089
is you can see that growth is

405

00:08:06.089  -->  00:08:06.099

406

00:08:06.099  -->  00:08:09.569
represented by a like a number with

407

00:08:09.569  -->  00:08:09.579

408

00:08:09.579  -->  00:08:11.519
decimals instead of a percentage

409

00:08:11.519  -->  00:08:11.529

410

00:08:11.529  -->  00:08:13.559
let's change that, but the way we

411

00:08:13.559  -->  00:08:13.569

412

00:08:13.569  -->  00:08:15.449
normally do it is through formatting

413

00:08:15.449  -->  00:08:15.459

414

00:08:15.459  -->  00:08:18.329
right? We right-click and we click on the

415

00:08:18.329  -->  00:08:18.339

416

00:08:18.339  -->  00:08:20.699
label and we click format here but what

417

00:08:20.699  -->  00:08:20.709

418

00:08:20.709  -->  00:08:22.799
you can do is you can change it for the

419

00:08:22.799  -->  00:08:22.809

420

00:08:22.809  -->  00:08:24.719
field itself, so whenever you use that

421

00:08:24.719  -->  00:08:24.729

422

00:08:24.729  -->  00:08:27.209
field, it's always represented as a

423

00:08:27.209  -->  00:08:27.219

424

00:08:27.219  -->  00:08:28.379
percentage and that's exactly what we

425

00:08:28.379  -->  00:08:28.389

426

00:08:28.389  -->  00:08:31.109
want. So let's click the drop-down and

427

00:08:31.109  -->  00:08:31.119

428

00:08:31.119  -->  00:08:34.860
we'll go to change the default

429

00:08:34.860  -->  00:08:34.870

430

00:08:34.870  -->  00:08:38.189
properties number format and here if you

431

00:08:38.189  -->  00:08:38.199

432

00:08:38.199  -->  00:08:40.019
change percentage and let's get rid of

433

00:08:40.019  -->  00:08:40.029

434

00:08:40.029  -->  00:08:42.300
the decimals you see that we've changed

435

00:08:42.300  -->  00:08:42.310

436

00:08:42.310  -->  00:08:44.490
it and as you'll see further down it

437

00:08:44.490  -->  00:08:44.500

438

00:08:44.500  -->  00:08:46.170
will always be like this and if you ever

439

00:08:46.170  -->  00:08:46.180

440

00:08:46.180  -->  00:08:48.179
want to change it or like change in one

441

00:08:48.179  -->  00:08:48.189

442

00:08:48.189  -->  00:08:49.590
specific case then you can go through

443

00:08:49.590  -->  00:08:49.600

444

00:08:49.600  -->  00:08:51.629
the format option and so on but by

445

00:08:51.629  -->  00:08:51.639

446

00:08:51.639  -->  00:08:52.710
default it will be a percentage

447

00:08:52.710  -->  00:08:52.720

448

00:08:52.720  -->  00:08:55.920
which is very handy. So how do we select

449

00:08:55.920  -->  00:08:55.930

450

00:08:55.930  -->  00:08:58.379
the top 10 growths. Well let's select the

451

00:08:58.379  -->  00:08:58.389

452

00:08:58.389  -->  00:09:01.439
top 10 companies here and create a set

453

00:09:01.439  -->  00:09:01.449

454

00:09:01.449  -->  00:09:09.150
and will say top 10 startups by growth.

455

00:09:09.150  -->  00:09:09.160

456

00:09:09.160  -->  00:09:12.240
Ok click ok so now we've got a new set

457

00:09:12.240  -->  00:09:12.250

458

00:09:12.250  -->  00:09:15.150
and let's see how we can use it in other

459

00:09:15.150  -->  00:09:15.160

460

00:09:15.160  -->  00:09:17.579
tabs that we create another worksheet that we create. So

461

00:09:17.579  -->  00:09:17.589

462

00:09:17.589  -->  00:09:20.249
great so great a worksheet and here

463

00:09:20.249  -->  00:09:20.259

464

00:09:20.259  -->  00:09:22.410
we'll say tree map. Let's say we want to

465

00:09:22.410  -->  00:09:22.420

466

00:09:22.420  -->  00:09:24.480
tree map all the option and growing

467

00:09:24.480  -->  00:09:24.490

468

00:09:24.490  -->  00:09:27.240
companies and to create a tree map. We're

469

00:09:27.240  -->  00:09:27.250

470

00:09:27.250  -->  00:09:29.249
going to take ID or name doesn't really

471

00:09:29.249  -->  00:09:29.259

472

00:09:29.259  -->  00:09:32.699
matter. Put it into detail and then take

473

00:09:32.699  -->  00:09:32.709

474

00:09:32.709  -->  00:09:35.220
growth percentage and put it into size,

475

00:09:35.220  -->  00:09:35.230

476

00:09:35.230  -->  00:09:37.110
by the way I just wanted to mention as

477

00:09:37.110  -->  00:09:37.120

478

00:09:37.120  -->  00:09:38.400
well that I'm doing a lot of these

479

00:09:38.400  -->  00:09:38.410

480

00:09:38.410  -->  00:09:40.290
things very quickly because we discussed

481

00:09:40.290  -->  00:09:40.300

482

00:09:40.300  -->  00:09:42.480
a lot of this most of this we discussed

483

00:09:42.480  -->  00:09:42.490

484

00:09:42.490  -->  00:09:45.660
in the basic course on Tableau so if you

485

00:09:45.660  -->  00:09:45.670

486

00:09:45.670  -->  00:09:47.610
feel that you aren't keeping up then

487

00:09:47.610  -->  00:09:47.620

488

00:09:47.620  -->  00:09:49.499
perhaps you might want to revisit the

489

00:09:49.499  -->  00:09:49.509

490

00:09:49.509  -->  00:09:52.499
basic course and just refresh some of

491

00:09:52.499  -->  00:09:52.509

492

00:09:52.509  -->  00:09:54.540
the knowledge because we have so much to

493

00:09:54.540  -->  00:09:54.550

494

00:09:54.550  -->  00:09:56.759
cover in this course we can't afford to

495

00:09:56.759  -->  00:09:56.769

496

00:09:56.769  -->  00:09:59.970
just discuss the basic things that we've

497

00:09:59.970  -->  00:09:59.980

498

00:09:59.980  -->  00:10:01.139
already talked about.

499

00:10:01.139  -->  00:10:01.149

500

00:10:01.149  -->  00:10:04.079
Ok so we've created this tree map, lets

501

00:10:04.079  -->  00:10:04.089

502

00:10:04.089  -->  00:10:05.519
get some color I'm going to hold down

503

00:10:05.519  -->  00:10:05.529

504

00:10:05.529  -->  00:10:08.939
control and drag this into color and now I

505

00:10:08.939  -->  00:10:08.949

506

00:10:08.949  -->  00:10:11.579
want to only look at the top 10 right, so

507

00:10:11.579  -->  00:10:11.589

508

00:10:11.589  -->  00:10:13.799
let's make it even more interesting I'm

509

00:10:13.799  -->  00:10:13.809

510

00:10:13.809  -->  00:10:15.299
going to take the name I'm going to drag

511

00:10:15.299  -->  00:10:15.309

512

00:10:15.309  -->  00:10:19.049
into label. I'm going to drag the growth

513

00:10:19.049  -->  00:10:19.059

514

00:10:19.059  -->  00:10:21.269
into label as well. As you can see, I

515

00:10:21.269  -->  00:10:21.279

516

00:10:21.279  -->  00:10:23.100
can't see anything because there's no

517

00:10:23.100  -->  00:10:23.110

518

00:10:23.110  -->  00:10:24.720
there's no space I only want to look at

519

00:10:24.720  -->  00:10:24.730

520

00:10:24.730  -->  00:10:26.400
the top 10. How would I do it? I'll do it

521

00:10:26.400  -->  00:10:26.410

522

00:10:26.410  -->  00:10:28.410
through a filter but in this case I have

523

00:10:28.410  -->  00:10:28.420

524

00:10:28.420  -->  00:10:31.049
a set which I can drag into a filter and

525

00:10:31.049  -->  00:10:31.059

526

00:10:31.059  -->  00:10:33.569
there we go. Viola! That quick and if i

527

00:10:33.569  -->  00:10:33.579

528

00:10:33.579  -->  00:10:36.809
click font and give it a 12 a good old

529

00:10:36.809  -->  00:10:36.819

530

00:10:36.819  -->  00:10:40.410
12 making a bit bigger in size. So as you

531

00:10:40.410  -->  00:10:40.420

532

00:10:40.420  -->  00:10:43.199
can see that was that quick very very

533

00:10:43.199  -->  00:10:43.209

534

00:10:43.209  -->  00:10:45.840
simple. So that's how sets work and

535

00:10:45.840  -->  00:10:45.850

536

00:10:45.850  -->  00:10:47.579
that's how they can help you speed up

537

00:10:47.579  -->  00:10:47.589

538

00:10:47.589  -->  00:10:50.699
your analysis in Tableau and help you

539

00:10:50.699  -->  00:10:50.709

540

00:10:50.709  -->  00:10:53.879
avoid doing a lot of repetitive tasks.

541

00:10:53.879  -->  00:10:53.889

542

00:10:53.889  -->  00:10:56.160
The only drawback of this type of set is

543

00:10:56.160  -->  00:10:56.170

544

00:10:56.170  -->  00:10:59.460
that it is static. It is hard-coded so it

545

00:10:59.460  -->  00:10:59.470

546

00:10:59.470  -->  00:11:01.230
means that it won't change as your

547

00:11:01.230  -->  00:11:01.240

548

00:11:01.240  -->  00:11:03.870
data changes. It won't adjust, so let's

549

00:11:03.870  -->  00:11:03.880

550

00:11:03.880  -->  00:11:05.460
right-click on the set and click edit

551

00:11:05.460  -->  00:11:05.470

552

00:11:05.470  -->  00:11:05.890
set

553

00:11:05.890  -->  00:11:05.900

554

00:11:05.900  -->  00:11:08.950
and what you'll see here is that the

555

00:11:08.950  -->  00:11:08.960

556

00:11:08.960  -->  00:11:11.650
names of these top 10 growers are

557

00:11:11.650  -->  00:11:11.660

558

00:11:11.660  -->  00:11:14.590
actually hard-coded into the set. You can

559

00:11:14.590  -->  00:11:14.600

560

00:11:14.600  -->  00:11:16.750
delete some of them if you want and it

561

00:11:16.750  -->  00:11:16.760

562

00:11:16.760  -->  00:11:18.970
won't be the top 10 will be less but

563

00:11:18.970  -->  00:11:18.980

564

00:11:18.980  -->  00:11:20.530
there are two problems with this first

565

00:11:20.530  -->  00:11:20.540

566

00:11:20.540  -->  00:11:22.660
of all if you want to refresh this

567

00:11:22.660  -->  00:11:22.670

568

00:11:22.670  -->  00:11:24.490
analysis later on if you get new

569

00:11:24.490  -->  00:11:24.500

570

00:11:24.500  -->  00:11:26.920
data or if you want to do this same

571

00:11:26.920  -->  00:11:26.930

572

00:11:26.930  -->  00:11:28.660
analysis next year, it's not just a

573

00:11:28.660  -->  00:11:28.670

574

00:11:28.670  -->  00:11:31.090
matter of pointing at a different field

575

00:11:31.090  -->  00:11:31.100

576

00:11:31.100  -->  00:11:33.340
and everything automatically fixing

577

00:11:33.340  -->  00:11:33.350

578

00:11:33.350  -->  00:11:35.080
itself up. You will actually have to go

579

00:11:35.080  -->  00:11:35.090

580

00:11:35.090  -->  00:11:36.820
and look for these top growers again and

581

00:11:36.820  -->  00:11:36.830

582

00:11:36.830  -->  00:11:40.240
creating new seti n order to then

583

00:11:40.240  -->  00:11:40.250

584

00:11:40.250  -->  00:11:42.670
replace it in your now, replace this one

585

00:11:42.670  -->  00:11:42.680

586

00:11:42.680  -->  00:11:44.680
with the new set. The other thing is that

587

00:11:44.680  -->  00:11:44.690

588

00:11:44.690  -->  00:11:46.960
lets say the board of directors didn't

589

00:11:46.960  -->  00:11:46.970

590

00:11:46.970  -->  00:11:48.910
want the top ten growers they wanted the

591

00:11:48.910  -->  00:11:48.920

592

00:11:48.920  -->  00:11:51.790
top 20 or the top 100 because nobody

593

00:11:51.790  -->  00:11:51.800

594

00:11:51.800  -->  00:11:53.980
said how many exactly they want

595

00:11:53.980  -->  00:11:53.990

596

00:11:53.990  -->  00:11:57.160
of the top growers and if they want more,

597

00:11:57.160  -->  00:11:57.170

598

00:11:57.170  -->  00:11:59.380
you can't add more members to the set. You

599

00:11:59.380  -->  00:11:59.390

600

00:11:59.390  -->  00:12:01.090
have to create a new one. So there's a

601

00:12:01.090  -->  00:12:01.100

602

00:12:01.100  -->  00:12:03.100
lot of manual work involved with

603

00:12:03.100  -->  00:12:03.110

604

00:12:03.110  -->  00:12:05.350
updating the set whether your data

605

00:12:05.350  -->  00:12:05.360

606

00:12:05.360  -->  00:12:07.030
changes or whether your conditions the

607

00:12:07.030  -->  00:12:07.040

608

00:12:07.040  -->  00:12:09.280
conditions of your analysis change and

609

00:12:09.280  -->  00:12:09.290

610

00:12:09.290  -->  00:12:11.560
this is where dynamic sets will come to

611

00:12:11.560  -->  00:12:11.570

612

00:12:11.570  -->  00:12:13.210
the rescue. We will introduce them in the

613

00:12:13.210  -->  00:12:13.220

614

00:12:13.220  -->  00:12:15.160
next tutorial and I look forward to

615

00:12:15.160  -->  00:12:15.170

616

00:12:15.170  -->  00:12:16.000
seeing you then.

617

00:12:16.000  -->  00:12:16.010

618

00:12:16.010  -->  00:12:23.200
Until next time, happy analyzing.
