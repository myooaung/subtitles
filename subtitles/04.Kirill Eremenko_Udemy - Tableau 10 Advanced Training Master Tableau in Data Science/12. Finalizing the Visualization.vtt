00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.769
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06.769  -->  00:00:06.779

3

00:00:06.779  -->  00:00:08.810
course on Tableau. And in today's

4

00:00:08.810  -->  00:00:08.820

5

00:00:08.820  -->  00:00:10.940
tutorial we're going to finalize our

6

00:00:10.940  -->  00:00:10.950

7

00:00:10.950  -->  00:00:13.039
visualization. We've already created

8

00:00:13.039  -->  00:00:13.049

9

00:00:13.049  -->  00:00:15.320
everything we need and all we have to do

10

00:00:15.320  -->  00:00:15.330

11

00:00:15.330  -->  00:00:21.140
is just take this chart from LOD exclude

12

00:00:21.140  -->  00:00:21.150

13

00:00:21.150  -->  00:00:24.470
part 2 and combine it with this chart

14

00:00:24.470  -->  00:00:24.480

15

00:00:24.480  -->  00:00:26.839
from LOD include. So let's go ahead and

16

00:00:26.839  -->  00:00:26.849

17

00:00:26.849  -->  00:00:28.820
do that, the quickest way is to just

18

00:00:28.820  -->  00:00:28.830

19

00:00:28.830  -->  00:00:32.659
simply duplicate this chart, this sheet

20

00:00:32.659  -->  00:00:32.669

21

00:00:32.669  -->  00:00:36.080
and here we're going to say combined

22

00:00:36.080  -->  00:00:36.090

23

00:00:36.090  -->  00:00:41.389
find this organization and then we're

24

00:00:41.389  -->  00:00:41.399

25

00:00:41.399  -->  00:00:44.690
going to create a second map and then on

26

00:00:44.690  -->  00:00:44.700

27

00:00:44.700  -->  00:00:48.319
this map we're going to so let's just

28

00:00:48.319  -->  00:00:48.329

29

00:00:48.329  -->  00:00:50.330
like this map by itself just going to

30

00:00:50.330  -->  00:00:50.340

31

00:00:50.340  -->  00:00:52.850
remove everything from here, I will leave

32

00:00:52.850  -->  00:00:52.860

33

00:00:52.860  -->  00:00:54.350
it at country but we'll leave it at

34

00:00:54.350  -->  00:00:54.360

35

00:00:54.360  -->  00:00:58.250
state level because that's what we are

36

00:00:58.250  -->  00:00:58.260

37

00:00:58.260  -->  00:01:00.889
now we want in this visualization and

38

00:01:00.889  -->  00:01:00.899

39

00:01:00.899  -->  00:01:02.630
now we just have to add these averages

40

00:01:02.630  -->  00:01:02.640

41

00:01:02.640  -->  00:01:06.980
back in so we want the average of our

42

00:01:06.980  -->  00:01:06.990

43

00:01:06.990  -->  00:01:09.830
city profit so we can use the LOD fixed.

44

00:01:09.830  -->  00:01:09.840

45

00:01:09.840  -->  00:01:12.140
So we can use LOD include when the

46

00:01:12.140  -->  00:01:12.150

47

00:01:12.150  -->  00:01:15.170
average of our city profit to be color

48

00:01:15.170  -->  00:01:15.180

49

00:01:15.180  -->  00:01:19.429
not sum but average measure, average and

50

00:01:19.429  -->  00:01:19.439

51

00:01:19.439  -->  00:01:21.530
we want so just hold down control and

52

00:01:21.530  -->  00:01:21.540

53

00:01:21.540  -->  00:01:25.190
the same thing as the label. In fact we

54

00:01:25.190  -->  00:01:25.200

55

00:01:25.200  -->  00:01:27.080
don't actually want the label in this

56

00:01:27.080  -->  00:01:27.090

57

00:01:27.090  -->  00:01:28.940
case, so its control zed that. We just

58

00:01:28.940  -->  00:01:28.950

59

00:01:28.950  -->  00:01:32.149
want the color which tells us which

60

00:01:32.149  -->  00:01:32.159

61

00:01:32.159  -->  00:01:35.810
states have higher or lower average

62

00:01:35.810  -->  00:01:35.820

63

00:01:35.820  -->  00:01:39.560
profit across their cities and now we

64

00:01:39.560  -->  00:01:39.570

65

00:01:39.570  -->  00:01:40.969
just want to combine these two. So all we

66

00:01:40.969  -->  00:01:40.979

67

00:01:40.979  -->  00:01:43.490
have to do is right click over here and

68

00:01:43.490  -->  00:01:43.500

69

00:01:43.500  -->  00:01:47.149
select dual-axis. There we go so just

70

00:01:47.149  -->  00:01:47.159

71

00:01:47.159  -->  00:01:49.609
make sure that the second chart is on

72

00:01:49.609  -->  00:01:49.619

73

00:01:49.619  -->  00:01:52.249
top of the first one if it's the other

74

00:01:52.249  -->  00:01:52.259

75

00:01:52.259  -->  00:01:53.569
way around you just have to drag these

76

00:01:53.569  -->  00:01:53.579

77

00:01:53.579  -->  00:01:55.310
and rearrange them like in this case you

78

00:01:55.310  -->  00:01:55.320

79

00:01:55.320  -->  00:01:57.530
can see that it's in the wrong order so

80

00:01:57.530  -->  00:01:57.540

81

00:01:57.540  -->  00:02:01.069
simply just rearrange them and again in

82

00:02:01.069  -->  00:02:01.079

83

00:02:01.079  -->  00:02:03.560
the second map we're going to remove the

84

00:02:03.560  -->  00:02:03.570

85

00:02:03.570  -->  00:02:06.289
comment because it's it makes it look

86

00:02:06.289  -->  00:02:06.299

87

00:02:06.299  -->  00:02:10.580
cluttered and so here it just simply all

88

00:02:10.580  -->  00:02:10.590

89

00:02:10.590  -->  00:02:12.230
we have left to do is

90

00:02:12.230  -->  00:02:12.240

91

00:02:12.240  -->  00:02:15.170
play around with a couple of aesthetical

92

00:02:15.170  -->  00:02:15.180

93

00:02:15.180  -->  00:02:19.160
features for example in this first chart

94

00:02:19.160  -->  00:02:19.170

95

00:02:19.170  -->  00:02:22.580
that's the color I don't think we really

96

00:02:22.580  -->  00:02:22.590

97

00:02:22.590  -->  00:02:25.100
need a border, so we just select none.

98

00:02:25.100  -->  00:02:25.110

99

00:02:25.110  -->  00:02:27.740
No actually, we do need a border just say

100

00:02:27.740  -->  00:02:27.750

101

00:02:27.750  -->  00:02:30.890
automatic so it's not as dark and then

102

00:02:30.890  -->  00:02:30.900

103

00:02:30.900  -->  00:02:33.500
in the second the second chart here we

104

00:02:33.500  -->  00:02:33.510

105

00:02:33.510  -->  00:02:35.390
can also play around like with size, for

106

00:02:35.390  -->  00:02:35.400

107

00:02:35.400  -->  00:02:37.190
instance make them a bit bigger then

108

00:02:37.190  -->  00:02:37.200

109

00:02:37.200  -->  00:02:39.320
with color you might want to make it a

110

00:02:39.320  -->  00:02:39.330

111

00:02:39.330  -->  00:02:42.050
bit more transparent maybe if you feel

112

00:02:42.050  -->  00:02:42.060

113

00:02:42.060  -->  00:02:42.800
like it.

114

00:02:42.800  -->  00:02:42.810

115

00:02:42.810  -->  00:02:45.290
Also you can also maybe make the border

116

00:02:45.290  -->  00:02:45.300

117

00:02:45.300  -->  00:02:49.250
a bit darker so you can see the point's

118

00:02:49.250  -->  00:02:49.260

119

00:02:49.260  -->  00:02:51.200
better. So there we go that's pretty much

120

00:02:51.200  -->  00:02:51.210

121

00:02:51.210  -->  00:02:51.860
it.

122

00:02:51.860  -->  00:02:51.870

123

00:02:51.870  -->  00:02:54.920
All we have to do left all that's left

124

00:02:54.920  -->  00:02:54.930

125

00:02:54.930  -->  00:02:58.370
is just to fix up this tool tips or

126

00:02:58.370  -->  00:02:58.380

127

00:02:58.380  -->  00:03:00.710
somebody does want to explore the data

128

00:03:00.710  -->  00:03:00.720

129

00:03:00.720  -->  00:03:03.800
set that they get the correct comments

130

00:03:03.800  -->  00:03:03.810

131

00:03:03.810  -->  00:03:06.140
that there after instead of this average

132

00:03:06.140  -->  00:03:06.150

133

00:03:06.150  -->  00:03:10.340
LOD, include city profit. They would get

134

00:03:10.340  -->  00:03:10.350

135

00:03:10.350  -->  00:03:14.030
like a common saying the average across

136

00:03:14.030  -->  00:03:14.040

137

00:03:14.040  -->  00:03:17.750
profit across cities and then for this

138

00:03:17.750  -->  00:03:17.760

139

00:03:17.760  -->  00:03:19.310
one they would get a comment saying

140

00:03:19.310  -->  00:03:19.320

141

00:03:19.320  -->  00:03:22.340
instead of LOD exclude state profit, they

142

00:03:22.340  -->  00:03:22.350

143

00:03:22.350  -->  00:03:26.390
would get just a state profit then they

144

00:03:26.390  -->  00:03:26.400

145

00:03:26.400  -->  00:03:30.110
would get profits over here would be the

146

00:03:30.110  -->  00:03:30.120

147

00:03:30.120  -->  00:03:33.650
city profit then ABS. So this this

148

00:03:33.650  -->  00:03:33.660

149

00:03:33.660  -->  00:03:35.540
doesn't even need to be there, so I'll

150

00:03:35.540  -->  00:03:35.550

151

00:03:35.550  -->  00:03:37.250
just quickly show you how our approach

152

00:03:37.250  -->  00:03:37.260

153

00:03:37.260  -->  00:03:40.340
this, I would go into work sheet, go into

154

00:03:40.340  -->  00:03:40.350

155

00:03:40.350  -->  00:03:44.450
tooltip and here you can simply just

156

00:03:44.450  -->  00:03:44.460

157

00:03:44.460  -->  00:03:46.160
adjust these things so we don't want

158

00:03:46.160  -->  00:03:46.170

159

00:03:46.170  -->  00:03:47.210
this one.

160

00:03:47.210  -->  00:03:47.220

161

00:03:47.220  -->  00:03:49.730
We don't want this one because that's

162

00:03:49.730  -->  00:03:49.740

163

00:03:49.740  -->  00:03:53.090
the color and the size then here it says

164

00:03:53.090  -->  00:03:53.100

165

00:03:53.100  -->  00:03:56.210
LOD exclude state profit. We just want

166

00:03:56.210  -->  00:03:56.220

167

00:03:56.220  -->  00:04:00.920
to change it to just state profit and

168

00:04:00.920  -->  00:04:00.930

169

00:04:00.930  -->  00:04:03.620
then here city. We want a city that's the

170

00:04:03.620  -->  00:04:03.630

171

00:04:03.630  -->  00:04:05.840
name of the city here. This would be

172

00:04:05.840  -->  00:04:05.850

173

00:04:05.850  -->  00:04:13.250
average profit across cities click okay.

174

00:04:13.250  -->  00:04:13.260

175

00:04:13.260  -->  00:04:16.220
Let's have a look at that now, so that's

176

00:04:16.220  -->  00:04:16.230

177

00:04:16.230  -->  00:04:17.120
better

178

00:04:17.120  -->  00:04:17.130

179

00:04:17.130  -->  00:04:19.039
and that's better as well so as you can

180

00:04:19.039  -->  00:04:19.049

181

00:04:19.049  -->  00:04:22.370
see we fix them up very quickly and it's

182

00:04:22.370  -->  00:04:22.380

183

00:04:22.380  -->  00:04:23.820
up to you what

184

00:04:23.820  -->  00:04:23.830

185

00:04:23.830  -->  00:04:25.080
information you would like to present

186

00:04:25.080  -->  00:04:25.090

187

00:04:25.090  -->  00:04:26.850
for instance because you have already

188

00:04:26.850  -->  00:04:26.860

189

00:04:26.860  -->  00:04:30.480
the state here you might want you might

190

00:04:30.480  -->  00:04:30.490

191

00:04:30.490  -->  00:04:32.760
not want to present the state profit

192

00:04:32.760  -->  00:04:32.770

193

00:04:32.770  -->  00:04:35.010
here but once again that is totally up

194

00:04:35.010  -->  00:04:35.020

195

00:04:35.020  -->  00:04:38.459
to you, other than that, the visualization has

196

00:04:38.459  -->  00:04:38.469

197

00:04:38.469  -->  00:04:40.649
been completed and people can already

198

00:04:40.649  -->  00:04:40.659

199

00:04:40.659  -->  00:04:44.279
derive insights from this visualization

200

00:04:44.279  -->  00:04:44.289

201

00:04:44.289  -->  00:04:47.339
and it's quite powerful and what I like

202

00:04:47.339  -->  00:04:47.349

203

00:04:47.349  -->  00:04:49.080
about it is that we actually use two

204

00:04:49.080  -->  00:04:49.090

205

00:04:49.090  -->  00:04:51.300
level of detail calculation. So we've got

206

00:04:51.300  -->  00:04:51.310

207

00:04:51.310  -->  00:04:54.990
the two charts, but the chart with the

208

00:04:54.990  -->  00:04:55.000

209

00:04:55.000  -->  00:04:57.240
states use a level of detail calculation

210

00:04:57.240  -->  00:04:57.250

211

00:04:57.250  -->  00:05:01.469
to access the chart in background to

212

00:05:01.469  -->  00:05:01.479

213

00:05:01.479  -->  00:05:04.469
access level of granularity with the

214

00:05:04.469  -->  00:05:04.479

215

00:05:04.479  -->  00:05:06.180
cities and bring that information back

216

00:05:06.180  -->  00:05:06.190

217

00:05:06.190  -->  00:05:09.959
whereas the chart with the cities uses a

218

00:05:09.959  -->  00:05:09.969

219

00:05:09.969  -->  00:05:12.029
level of detail calculation to access

220

00:05:12.029  -->  00:05:12.039

221

00:05:12.039  -->  00:05:14.790
the level of granularity with the states

222

00:05:14.790  -->  00:05:14.800

223

00:05:14.800  -->  00:05:16.260
and bring information back. So they're

224

00:05:16.260  -->  00:05:16.270

225

00:05:16.270  -->  00:05:18.119
kind of like the right next to each

226

00:05:18.119  -->  00:05:18.129

227

00:05:18.129  -->  00:05:19.649
other but there's they still require

228

00:05:19.649  -->  00:05:19.659

229

00:05:19.659  -->  00:05:21.570
this level of detail calculations to

230

00:05:21.570  -->  00:05:21.580

231

00:05:21.580  -->  00:05:24.059
access information at each other's level

232

00:05:24.059  -->  00:05:24.069

233

00:05:24.069  -->  00:05:26.369
of granularity. I find it quite an

234

00:05:26.369  -->  00:05:26.379

235

00:05:26.379  -->  00:05:29.339
interesting concept but that's the way

236

00:05:29.339  -->  00:05:29.349

237

00:05:29.349  -->  00:05:31.170
it is and as you can see as you could

238

00:05:31.170  -->  00:05:31.180

239

00:05:31.180  -->  00:05:33.029
tell from this section there's nothing

240

00:05:33.029  -->  00:05:33.039

241

00:05:33.039  -->  00:05:36.149
difficult about creating these level of

242

00:05:36.149  -->  00:05:36.159

243

00:05:36.159  -->  00:05:38.430
detailed calculations. So I hope you

244

00:05:38.430  -->  00:05:38.440

245

00:05:38.440  -->  00:05:40.649
enjoyed creating this visualization, I

246

00:05:40.649  -->  00:05:40.659

247

00:05:40.659  -->  00:05:42.749
hope we definitely covered a lot of

248

00:05:42.749  -->  00:05:42.759

249

00:05:42.759  -->  00:05:44.700
ground. We cover a lot of different level

250

00:05:44.700  -->  00:05:44.710

251

00:05:44.710  -->  00:05:47.670
of detail calculations in a lot of

252

00:05:47.670  -->  00:05:47.680

253

00:05:47.680  -->  00:05:51.360
detail to not to repeat myself but

254

00:05:51.360  -->  00:05:51.370

255

00:05:51.370  -->  00:05:54.420
definitely this just requires practice.

256

00:05:54.420  -->  00:05:54.430

257

00:05:54.430  -->  00:05:57.029
You just need to practice and look at

258

00:05:57.029  -->  00:05:57.039

259

00:05:57.039  -->  00:05:59.550
different scenarios, different types of

260

00:05:59.550  -->  00:05:59.560

261

00:05:59.560  -->  00:06:01.950
dimensions where you would use level of

262

00:06:01.950  -->  00:06:01.960

263

00:06:01.960  -->  00:06:03.779
detail calculations just to make sure

264

00:06:03.779  -->  00:06:03.789

265

00:06:03.789  -->  00:06:05.850
that all this knowledge sinks in and

266

00:06:05.850  -->  00:06:05.860

267

00:06:05.860  -->  00:06:09.659
that you are very proficient with it. And

268

00:06:09.659  -->  00:06:09.669

269

00:06:09.669  -->  00:06:11.490
I hope you enjoyed this section. I look

270

00:06:11.490  -->  00:06:11.500

271

00:06:11.500  -->  00:06:13.350
forward to seeing you next time and

272

00:06:13.350  -->  00:06:13.360

273

00:06:13.360  -->  00:06:20.069
until then happy analyzing.
