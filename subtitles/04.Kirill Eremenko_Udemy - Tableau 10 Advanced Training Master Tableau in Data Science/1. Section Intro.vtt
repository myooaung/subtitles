00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:05.700
Hello and welcome to this section of

2

00:00:05.700  -->  00:00:07.740
the advanced Tableau course. You might

3

00:00:07.740  -->  00:00:09.719
be a bit surprised to be seeing scuba

4

00:00:09.719  -->  00:00:11.639
divers swimming around in this tutorial.

5

00:00:11.639  -->  00:00:14.580
But this is actually very relevant to

6

00:00:14.580  -->  00:00:16.470
what we're going to be discussing. You

7

00:00:16.470  -->  00:00:19.199
see these scuba divers are examining the

8

00:00:19.199  -->  00:00:21.210
reef that's directly under them in a lot

9

00:00:21.210  -->  00:00:23.220
of detail. They're going very granular

10

00:00:23.220  -->  00:00:25.050
but at the same time what they're not

11

00:00:25.050  -->  00:00:26.849
seeing is the bigger picture which

12

00:00:26.849  -->  00:00:29.010
you'll see as soon as the drone start

13

00:00:29.010  -->  00:00:30.570
showing up and that's what we're going

14

00:00:30.570  -->  00:00:31.890
to be talking about in this section.

15

00:00:31.890  -->  00:00:33.420
We're going to be discussing level of

16

00:00:33.420  -->  00:00:35.520
detail calculations which our

17

00:00:35.520  -->  00:00:36.840
calculations had bring together

18

00:00:36.840  -->  00:00:39.660
information from different levels of

19

00:00:39.660  -->  00:00:42.450
granularity at the same thing data set. Super

20

00:00:42.450  -->  00:00:45.210
excited to get this section started. Can't wait

21

00:00:45.210  -->  00:00:47.280
to see you in the first tutorial and until then,

22

00:00:47.280  -->  00:01:06.209
happy analyzing.
