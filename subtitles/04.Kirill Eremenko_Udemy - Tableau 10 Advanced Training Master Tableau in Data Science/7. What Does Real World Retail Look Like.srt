00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,220
Hello and welcome back to the advance

2

00:00:07,220  -->  00:00:07,230

3

00:00:07,230  -->  00:00:09,410
course on Tableau. Now that we've

4

00:00:09,410  -->  00:00:09,420

5

00:00:09,420  -->  00:00:13,100
prepared our data set and our connection

6

00:00:13,100  -->  00:00:13,110

7

00:00:13,110  -->  00:00:15,350
we can go ahead and create the main

8

00:00:15,350  -->  00:00:15,360

9

00:00:15,360  -->  00:00:16,820
visualization that we'll be using for

10

00:00:16,820  -->  00:00:16,830

11

00:00:16,830  -->  00:00:19,429
this data. So let's go ahead and do that,

12

00:00:19,429  -->  00:00:19,439

13

00:00:19,439  -->  00:00:22,400
we're going to create a new sheet and

14

00:00:22,400  -->  00:00:22,410

15

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:28,370
this one we will call industry analysis.

16

00:00:28,370  -->  00:00:28,380

17

00:00:28,380  -->  00:00:31,250
Alright and what do we want to see here.

18

00:00:31,250  -->  00:00:31,260

19

00:00:31,260  -->  00:00:34,010
Well to start off with, let's visualize

20

00:00:34,010  -->  00:00:34,020

21

00:00:34,020  -->  00:00:37,370
the month of the year. So first of all

22

00:00:37,370  -->  00:00:37,380

23

00:00:37,380  -->  00:00:41,660
let's rename this column to something

24

00:00:41,660  -->  00:00:41,670

25

00:00:41,670  -->  00:00:42,229
else,

26

00:00:42,229  -->  00:00:42,239

27

00:00:42,239  -->  00:00:46,790
so let's say date and now let's

28

00:00:46,790  -->  00:00:46,800

29

00:00:46,800  -->  00:00:49,130
visualize this date column here but

30

00:00:49,130  -->  00:00:49,140

31

00:00:49,140  -->  00:00:50,389
we're going to look at rather than

32

00:00:50,389  -->  00:00:50,399

33

00:00:50,399  -->  00:00:52,130
looking at years because our data

34

00:00:52,130  -->  00:00:52,140

35

00:00:52,140  -->  00:00:53,840
at month level we're going to just like

36

00:00:53,840  -->  00:00:53,850

37

00:00:53,850  -->  00:00:55,430
this month the green one.

38

00:00:55,430  -->  00:00:55,440

39

00:00:55,440  -->  00:00:57,860
So we get timeline, now we're going to

40

00:00:57,860  -->  00:00:57,870

41

00:00:57,870  -->  00:01:01,849
look break our data down by state. So

42

00:01:01,849  -->  00:01:01,859

43

00:01:01,859  -->  00:01:04,219
there we go, that's every single state we

44

00:01:04,219  -->  00:01:04,229

45

00:01:04,229  -->  00:01:06,560
have here and be careful there is a

46

00:01:06,560  -->  00:01:06,570

47

00:01:06,570  -->  00:01:09,230
total for states so we'll get back to

48

00:01:09,230  -->  00:01:09,240

49

00:01:09,240  -->  00:01:12,679
that but just take a mental note of that

50

00:01:12,679  -->  00:01:12,689

51

00:01:12,689  -->  00:01:15,170
there's a total and then we're going to

52

00:01:15,170  -->  00:01:15,180

53

00:01:15,180  -->  00:01:16,880
take industry or throw it in here as

54

00:01:16,880  -->  00:01:16,890

55

00:01:16,890  -->  00:01:21,410
well and so here we've got the

56

00:01:21,410  -->  00:01:21,420

57

00:01:21,420  -->  00:01:23,630
industries and they're broken down by

58

00:01:23,630  -->  00:01:23,640

59

00:01:23,640  -->  00:01:25,460
states and all we have to do is add the

60

00:01:25,460  -->  00:01:25,470

61

00:01:25,470  -->  00:01:26,749
turnover and also bear in mind that

62

00:01:26,749  -->  00:01:26,759

63

00:01:26,759  -->  00:01:30,380
there is a total for industries here as

64

00:01:30,380  -->  00:01:30,390

65

00:01:30,390  -->  00:01:34,370
well. So now let's take the turnover and

66

00:01:34,370  -->  00:01:34,380

67

00:01:34,380  -->  00:01:36,740
add it to our visualization. We'll put it in

68

00:01:36,740  -->  00:01:36,750

69

00:01:36,750  -->  00:01:39,920
here as you can see it's not showing as

70

00:01:39,920  -->  00:01:39,930

71

00:01:39,930  -->  00:01:42,980
anything. It's completely flat, if you

72

00:01:42,980  -->  00:01:42,990

73

00:01:42,990  -->  00:01:45,139
scroll down you'll see why and that is

74

00:01:45,139  -->  00:01:45,149

75

00:01:45,149  -->  00:01:48,200
because sometimes it's not flat and that

76

00:01:48,200  -->  00:01:48,210

77

00:01:48,210  -->  00:01:49,940
is mostly for the total. So the totals

78

00:01:49,940  -->  00:01:49,950

79

00:01:49,950  -->  00:01:53,060
are much greater and therefore they're

80

00:01:53,060  -->  00:01:53,070

81

00:01:53,070  -->  00:01:56,090
completely overwhelming the rest of the

82

00:01:56,090  -->  00:01:56,100

83

00:01:56,100  -->  00:01:59,840
visualization that is because every you

84

00:01:59,840  -->  00:01:59,850

85

00:01:59,850  -->  00:02:02,690
can see that every single chart here has

86

00:02:02,690  -->  00:02:02,700

87

00:02:02,700  -->  00:02:05,870
the same axis range and to fix

88

00:02:05,870  -->  00:02:05,880

89

00:02:05,880  -->  00:02:07,399
that we have to give them independent

90

00:02:07,399  -->  00:02:07,409

91

00:02:07,409  -->  00:02:10,070
axis so that they wouldn't

92

00:02:10,070  -->  00:02:10,080

93

00:02:10,080  -->  00:02:12,650
have they wouldn't calculate the axis

94

00:02:12,650  -->  00:02:12,660

95

00:02:12,660  -->  00:02:16,580
range based of the most volatile I

96

00:02:16,580  -->  00:02:16,590

97

00:02:16,590  -->  00:02:20,480
guess call a row that we have, so right

98

00:02:20,480  -->  00:02:20,490

99

00:02:20,490  -->  00:02:23,060
click click edit access and select set

100

00:02:23,060  -->  00:02:23,070

101

00:02:23,070  -->  00:02:25,730
automatic, select independent axis

102

00:02:25,730  -->  00:02:25,740

103

00:02:25,740  -->  00:02:28,160
range for each row or column click ok

104

00:02:28,160  -->  00:02:28,170

105

00:02:28,170  -->  00:02:30,020
and there we go that's what we wanted

106

00:02:30,020  -->  00:02:30,030

107

00:02:30,030  -->  00:02:32,480
what we wanted to see. One more thing,

108

00:02:32,480  -->  00:02:32,490

109

00:02:32,490  -->  00:02:34,550
let's take industry hold down control put

110

00:02:34,550  -->  00:02:34,560

111

00:02:34,560  -->  00:02:37,970
it into color and there we go much

112

00:02:37,970  -->  00:02:37,980

113

00:02:37,980  -->  00:02:38,930
better.

114

00:02:38,930  -->  00:02:38,940

115

00:02:38,940  -->  00:02:42,080
So what we're seeing here is for the

116

00:02:42,080  -->  00:02:42,090

117

00:02:42,090  -->  00:02:44,690
years that we specified in our data source

118

00:02:44,690  -->  00:02:44,700

119

00:02:44,700  -->  00:02:47,960
filter, we're seeing the turnover for

120

00:02:47,960  -->  00:02:47,970

121

00:02:47,970  -->  00:02:50,840
every single industry so there you go

122

00:02:50,840  -->  00:02:50,850

123

00:02:50,850  -->  00:02:53,150
that's clothing and retailing that's

124

00:02:53,150  -->  00:02:53,160

125

00:02:53,160  -->  00:02:55,699
department stores that's electrical and

126

00:02:55,699  -->  00:02:55,709

127

00:02:55,709  -->  00:02:57,620
electronic goods and so on and also

128

00:02:57,620  -->  00:02:57,630

129

00:02:57,630  -->  00:03:00,830
broken down by state. So now this is

130

00:03:00,830  -->  00:03:00,840

131

00:03:00,840  -->  00:03:03,710
great. This is our visualization but as you

132

00:03:03,710  -->  00:03:03,720

133

00:03:03,720  -->  00:03:05,810
remember we applied a datasource filter

134

00:03:05,810  -->  00:03:05,820

135

00:03:05,820  -->  00:03:09,680
to simplify or expedite our analysis to

136

00:03:09,680  -->  00:03:09,690

137

00:03:09,690  -->  00:03:11,449
get us to this point and now it's the

138

00:03:11,449  -->  00:03:11,459

139

00:03:11,459  -->  00:03:14,479
time to remove that filter. If this was a

140

00:03:14,479  -->  00:03:14,489

141

00:03:14,489  -->  00:03:17,630
very quick journey for us we got here

142

00:03:17,630  -->  00:03:17,640

143

00:03:17,640  -->  00:03:20,360
quickly in other cases you might want to

144

00:03:20,360  -->  00:03:20,370

145

00:03:20,370  -->  00:03:22,670
keep the data source filter for longer if

146

00:03:22,670  -->  00:03:22,680

147

00:03:22,680  -->  00:03:24,650
your visualization is more complex but

148

00:03:24,650  -->  00:03:24,660

149

00:03:24,660  -->  00:03:26,930
for us it is a good time to get of the

150

00:03:26,930  -->  00:03:26,940

151

00:03:26,940  -->  00:03:29,120
filter, so let's go ahead and do that. You

152

00:03:29,120  -->  00:03:29,130

153

00:03:29,130  -->  00:03:30,710
can go to the data source and get rid of

154

00:03:30,710  -->  00:03:30,720

155

00:03:30,720  -->  00:03:32,270
it there or you can right-click your

156

00:03:32,270  -->  00:03:32,280

157

00:03:32,280  -->  00:03:34,880
data said here or connection here

158

00:03:34,880  -->  00:03:34,890

159

00:03:34,890  -->  00:03:38,780
and click edit data source filters select

160

00:03:38,780  -->  00:03:38,790

161

00:03:38,790  -->  00:03:42,080
the filter and click remove, click ok and what

162

00:03:42,080  -->  00:03:42,090

163

00:03:42,090  -->  00:03:43,729
you'll see is that all of the missing

164

00:03:43,729  -->  00:03:43,739

165

00:03:43,739  -->  00:03:46,520
rows have been added back and now our

166

00:03:46,520  -->  00:03:46,530

167

00:03:46,530  -->  00:03:49,670
data set is, our visualization is being

168

00:03:49,670  -->  00:03:49,680

169

00:03:49,680  -->  00:03:50,330
presented

170

00:03:50,330  -->  00:03:50,340

171

00:03:50,340  -->  00:03:53,300
be for the whole period between 1982

172

00:03:53,300  -->  00:03:53,310

173

00:03:53,310  -->  00:03:57,290
and 2015. So these nulls are just

174

00:03:57,290  -->  00:03:57,300

175

00:03:57,300  -->  00:03:59,990
nulls in our data set because some you

176

00:03:59,990  -->  00:04:00,000

177

00:04:00,000  -->  00:04:02,570
scroll down you'll see some industries

178

00:04:02,570  -->  00:04:02,580

179

00:04:02,580  -->  00:04:04,759
didn't have information for a certain

180

00:04:04,759  -->  00:04:04,769

181

00:04:04,769  -->  00:04:05,840
period of time so we're just going to

182

00:04:05,840  -->  00:04:05,850

183

00:04:05,850  -->  00:04:08,150
click that and are actually going to

184

00:04:08,150  -->  00:04:08,160

185

00:04:08,160  -->  00:04:11,030
right click and click hide indicator so

186

00:04:11,030  -->  00:04:11,040

187

00:04:11,040  -->  00:04:13,100
it's not bothering us. There we go so

188

00:04:13,100  -->  00:04:13,110

189

00:04:13,110  -->  00:04:15,650
those are our industries and as you can

190

00:04:15,650  -->  00:04:15,660

191

00:04:15,660  -->  00:04:18,349
see this is already a very exciting data

192

00:04:18,349  -->  00:04:18,359

193

00:04:18,359  -->  00:04:20,150
set.

194

00:04:20,150  -->  00:04:20,160

195

00:04:20,160  -->  00:04:22,250
I'm going to what I'm going to do is I'm

196

00:04:22,250  -->  00:04:22,260

197

00:04:22,260  -->  00:04:22,600
going

198

00:04:22,600  -->  00:04:22,610

199

00:04:22,610  -->  00:04:25,450
to actually I was going to make some

200

00:04:25,450  -->  00:04:25,460

201

00:04:25,460  -->  00:04:28,390
more room for the visual but there isn't

202

00:04:28,390  -->  00:04:28,400

203

00:04:28,400  -->  00:04:30,969
anything that we can actually take out.

204

00:04:30,969  -->  00:04:30,979

205

00:04:30,979  -->  00:04:34,480
Anyway so it is a pretty exciting

206

00:04:34,480  -->  00:04:34,490

207

00:04:34,490  -->  00:04:36,249
data set because you can select an

208

00:04:36,249  -->  00:04:36,259

209

00:04:36,259  -->  00:04:39,189
industry and you'll see how in that

210

00:04:39,189  -->  00:04:39,199

211

00:04:39,199  -->  00:04:43,809
state it is it has it has been changing

212

00:04:43,809  -->  00:04:43,819

213

00:04:43,819  -->  00:04:46,420
all the sales or the turnover in that

214

00:04:46,420  -->  00:04:46,430

215

00:04:46,430  -->  00:04:49,749
industry how they've been the dynamics

216

00:04:49,749  -->  00:04:49,759

217

00:04:49,759  -->  00:04:52,689
how they've been changing between 1982 and 2015

218

00:04:52,689  -->  00:04:52,699

219

00:04:52,699  -->  00:04:54,339
and this is all actual real data

220

00:04:54,339  -->  00:04:54,349

221

00:04:54,349  -->  00:04:56,290
taken off the Australian Bureau of

222

00:04:56,290  -->  00:04:56,300

223

00:04:56,300  -->  00:04:58,990
Statistics website. So let's let's play

224

00:04:58,990  -->  00:04:59,000

225

00:04:59,000  -->  00:05:02,469
around with this and let's see what we

226

00:05:02,469  -->  00:05:02,479

227

00:05:02,479  -->  00:05:05,200
can find just have fun insights from

228

00:05:05,200  -->  00:05:05,210

229

00:05:05,210  -->  00:05:08,320
this real-world data. So there's a

230

00:05:08,320  -->  00:05:08,330

231

00:05:08,330  -->  00:05:10,149
Australian capital territory and the Australian

232

00:05:10,149  -->  00:05:10,159

233

00:05:10,159  -->  00:05:12,189
capital territory isn't a big

234

00:05:12,189  -->  00:05:12,199

235

00:05:12,199  -->  00:05:15,010
state so what would want to do right

236

00:05:15,010  -->  00:05:15,020

237

00:05:15,020  -->  00:05:17,290
what we would want to do is we'd either

238

00:05:17,290  -->  00:05:17,300

239

00:05:17,300  -->  00:05:18,459
want to look at a big state like

240

00:05:18,459  -->  00:05:18,469

241

00:05:18,469  -->  00:05:20,619
New South Wales or we'd want to look at

242

00:05:20,619  -->  00:05:20,629

243

00:05:20,629  -->  00:05:23,800
Australia over all right? And normally what

244

00:05:23,800  -->  00:05:23,810

245

00:05:23,810  -->  00:05:26,379
you would think to do to get a straight

246

00:05:26,379  -->  00:05:26,389

247

00:05:26,389  -->  00:05:28,809
overall you just take the state out of

248

00:05:28,809  -->  00:05:28,819

249

00:05:28,819  -->  00:05:31,570
your visualization right so I'll just

250

00:05:31,570  -->  00:05:31,580

251

00:05:31,580  -->  00:05:33,820
take a drag someone here to get rid of

252

00:05:33,820  -->  00:05:33,830

253

00:05:33,830  -->  00:05:36,100
it and that would add up so because we

254

00:05:36,100  -->  00:05:36,110

255

00:05:36,110  -->  00:05:37,839
have sum here to add up the turnover

256

00:05:37,839  -->  00:05:37,849

257

00:05:37,849  -->  00:05:39,969
for all the states right so and that's

258

00:05:39,969  -->  00:05:39,979

259

00:05:39,979  -->  00:05:41,800
not make sense you add up the turnover

260

00:05:41,800  -->  00:05:41,810

261

00:05:41,810  -->  00:05:48,070
for let's say what I say household goods

262

00:05:48,070  -->  00:05:48,080

263

00:05:48,080  -->  00:05:50,019
and retailing you add up a turnover for

264

00:05:50,019  -->  00:05:50,029

265

00:05:50,029  -->  00:05:51,969
all the states and then you get the

266

00:05:51,969  -->  00:05:51,979

267

00:05:51,979  -->  00:05:53,890
total but here this would be a mistake

268

00:05:53,890  -->  00:05:53,900

269

00:05:53,900  -->  00:05:57,429
and in reality the turnover is not that

270

00:05:57,429  -->  00:05:57,439

271

00:05:57,439  -->  00:05:58,959
great for this industry and that is

272

00:05:58,959  -->  00:05:58,969

273

00:05:58,969  -->  00:06:01,059
because as we saw previously what I

274

00:06:01,059  -->  00:06:01,069

275

00:06:01,069  -->  00:06:03,550
pointed out is that we have the totals

276

00:06:03,550  -->  00:06:03,560

277

00:06:03,560  -->  00:06:05,559
in this data set so this data set

278

00:06:05,559  -->  00:06:05,569

279

00:06:05,569  -->  00:06:08,170
contains totals for all the states so

280

00:06:08,170  -->  00:06:08,180

281

00:06:08,180  -->  00:06:10,390
let's take the state column back and put

282

00:06:10,390  -->  00:06:10,400

283

00:06:10,400  -->  00:06:12,640
it in here and what you'll find is if

284

00:06:12,640  -->  00:06:12,650

285

00:06:12,650  -->  00:06:14,079
you scroll down so you gotta straighten

286

00:06:14,079  -->  00:06:14,089

287

00:06:14,089  -->  00:06:16,119
capital territory over there so if I

288

00:06:16,119  -->  00:06:16,129

289

00:06:16,129  -->  00:06:17,529
keep scrolling down, you got New South Wales.

290

00:06:17,529  -->  00:06:17,539

291

00:06:17,539  -->  00:06:20,350
I might make this a bit bigger so

292

00:06:20,350  -->  00:06:20,360

293

00:06:20,360  -->  00:06:25,899
you can see. There we go, we've got New

294

00:06:25,899  -->  00:06:25,909

295

00:06:25,909  -->  00:06:27,700
South Wales there so if I keep scrolling

296

00:06:27,700  -->  00:06:27,710

297

00:06:27,710  -->  00:06:31,059
on Northern territory Queensland, South

298

00:06:31,059  -->  00:06:31,069

299

00:06:31,069  -->  00:06:33,610
Australia, Tasmania and you've got

300

00:06:33,610  -->  00:06:33,620

301

00:06:33,620  -->  00:06:35,220
total so this is not even though this

302

00:06:35,220  -->  00:06:35,230

303

00:06:35,230  -->  00:06:37,080
this is a more states down there like

304

00:06:37,080  -->  00:06:37,090

305

00:06:37,090  -->  00:06:40,050
Victoria, Western Australia but here

306

00:06:40,050  -->  00:06:40,060

307

00:06:40,060  -->  00:06:41,790
you've got total set and be careful that

308

00:06:41,790  -->  00:06:41,800

309

00:06:41,800  -->  00:06:44,160
sometimes statistical data especially it

310

00:06:44,160  -->  00:06:44,170

311

00:06:44,170  -->  00:06:46,350
contains already the total so if you

312

00:06:46,350  -->  00:06:46,360

313

00:06:46,360  -->  00:06:48,000
were to take out the state column and

314

00:06:48,000  -->  00:06:48,010

315

00:06:48,010  -->  00:06:49,440
think that's a total you'd be double

316

00:06:49,440  -->  00:06:49,450

317

00:06:49,450  -->  00:06:51,240
counting so we don't want to double

318

00:06:51,240  -->  00:06:51,250

319

00:06:51,250  -->  00:06:52,440
count and we'll just look

320

00:06:52,440  -->  00:06:52,450

321

00:06:52,450  -->  00:06:57,300
explore our data for this state

322

00:06:57,300  -->  00:06:57,310

323

00:06:57,310  -->  00:06:59,310
which is total so for the whole Australia

324

00:06:59,310  -->  00:06:59,320

325

00:06:59,320  -->  00:07:01,200
basically so you can see that cafes and

326

00:07:01,200  -->  00:07:01,210

327

00:07:01,210  -->  00:07:04,440
restaurants have been growing, cafes and

328

00:07:04,440  -->  00:07:04,450

329

00:07:04,450  -->  00:07:06,450
restaurants and take away food sources

330

00:07:06,450  -->  00:07:06,460

331

00:07:06,460  -->  00:07:09,630
growing as well there you know it's a

332

00:07:09,630  -->  00:07:09,640

333

00:07:09,640  -->  00:07:12,930
lower-level actually 3 billion

334

00:07:12,930  -->  00:07:12,940

335

00:07:12,940  -->  00:07:14,850
dollars the turnover is like monthly

336

00:07:14,850  -->  00:07:14,860

337

00:07:14,860  -->  00:07:19,470
turn over 3.3 and here it's only 2.1 so

338

00:07:19,470  -->  00:07:19,480

339

00:07:19,480  -->  00:07:23,040
clothing and retailing that's

340

00:07:23,040  -->  00:07:23,050

341

00:07:23,050  -->  00:07:24,660
very interesting right so what can you

342

00:07:24,660  -->  00:07:24,670

343

00:07:24,670  -->  00:07:26,820
see here this is this pattern right what

344

00:07:26,820  -->  00:07:26,830

345

00:07:26,830  -->  00:07:29,400
is this pattern and this is and you can

346

00:07:29,400  -->  00:07:29,410

347

00:07:29,410  -->  00:07:32,610
see it's it's evident in a lot of

348

00:07:32,610  -->  00:07:32,620

349

00:07:32,620  -->  00:07:36,330
industries this kind of like a saw. It's

350

00:07:36,330  -->  00:07:36,340

351

00:07:36,340  -->  00:07:38,280
going up and down up and down and it's

352

00:07:38,280  -->  00:07:38,290

353

00:07:38,290  -->  00:07:40,560
obviously a seasonal pattern and what

354

00:07:40,560  -->  00:07:40,570

355

00:07:40,570  -->  00:07:42,840
what is happening here why is it always

356

00:07:42,840  -->  00:07:42,850

357

00:07:42,850  -->  00:07:44,520
this spike what's going on?

358

00:07:44,520  -->  00:07:44,530

359

00:07:44,530  -->  00:07:47,790
So that's very interesting and this

360

00:07:47,790  -->  00:07:47,800

361

00:07:47,800  -->  00:07:49,890
knowledge actually might be able to some

362

00:07:49,890  -->  00:07:49,900

363

00:07:49,900  -->  00:07:52,170
sometimes, something apply in your future

364

00:07:52,170  -->  00:07:52,180

365

00:07:52,180  -->  00:07:53,790
work if you look at the pattern you'll

366

00:07:53,790  -->  00:07:53,800

367

00:07:53,800  -->  00:07:56,790
see that the peak always occurs in

368

00:07:56,790  -->  00:07:56,800

369

00:07:56,800  -->  00:07:59,010
December right? So that's when people are

370

00:07:59,010  -->  00:07:59,020

371

00:07:59,020  -->  00:08:02,160
preparing for Christmas for new years,

372

00:08:02,160  -->  00:08:02,170

373

00:08:02,170  -->  00:08:04,020
they're buying presents and they're

374

00:08:04,020  -->  00:08:04,030

375

00:08:04,030  -->  00:08:05,820
spending a lot of money because

376

00:08:05,820  -->  00:08:05,830

377

00:08:05,830  -->  00:08:07,530
everything's on discount, you've got

378

00:08:07,530  -->  00:08:07,540

379

00:08:07,540  -->  00:08:10,620
boxing day, you've got lots and lots of

380

00:08:10,620  -->  00:08:10,630

381

00:08:10,630  -->  00:08:14,310
reasons to spend money and where is

382

00:08:14,310  -->  00:08:14,320

383

00:08:14,320  -->  00:08:17,430
always the troll right? Where is it? And

384

00:08:17,430  -->  00:08:17,440

385

00:08:17,440  -->  00:08:19,530
the the bottom it's always in February

386

00:08:19,530  -->  00:08:19,540

387

00:08:19,540  -->  00:08:22,230
so February and this is, this is actual,

388

00:08:22,230  -->  00:08:22,240

389

00:08:22,240  -->  00:08:24,240
this is actually how it is in reality

390

00:08:24,240  -->  00:08:24,250

391

00:08:24,250  -->  00:08:26,880
February is the worst month for retail

392

00:08:26,880  -->  00:08:26,890

393

00:08:26,890  -->  00:08:29,820
and if you work or any of you working

394

00:08:29,820  -->  00:08:29,830

395

00:08:29,830  -->  00:08:32,940
the retail industry you will be able to

396

00:08:32,940  -->  00:08:32,950

397

00:08:32,950  -->  00:08:35,550
confirm this. February is the worst month

398

00:08:35,550  -->  00:08:35,560

399

00:08:35,560  -->  00:08:37,469
not January but February and why is that

400

00:08:37,469  -->  00:08:37,479

401

00:08:37,479  -->  00:08:40,260
and that is because that is when people

402

00:08:40,260  -->  00:08:40,270

403

00:08:40,270  -->  00:08:42,630
have our help paying off their credit

404

00:08:42,630  -->  00:08:42,640

405

00:08:42,640  -->  00:08:45,480
cards for the purchases that made in

406

00:08:45,480  -->  00:08:45,490

407

00:08:45,490  -->  00:08:47,830
December so that is when

408

00:08:47,830  -->  00:08:47,840

409

00:08:47,840  -->  00:08:50,440
all that the time has passed and the

410

00:08:50,440  -->  00:08:50,450

411

00:08:50,450  -->  00:08:53,170
time has come to pay off credit cards

412

00:08:53,170  -->  00:08:53,180

413

00:08:53,180  -->  00:08:56,680
and people are very conservative for

414

00:08:56,680  -->  00:08:56,690

415

00:08:56,690  -->  00:08:58,000
their spending. So that is a very

416

00:08:58,000  -->  00:08:58,010

417

00:08:58,010  -->  00:08:59,620
interesting pattern and you can actually

418

00:08:59,620  -->  00:08:59,630

419

00:08:59,630  -->  00:09:02,830
see it here from real data so if

420

00:09:02,830  -->  00:09:02,840

421

00:09:02,840  -->  00:09:04,870
you're a retail store and you just open

422

00:09:04,870  -->  00:09:04,880

423

00:09:04,880  -->  00:09:06,940
up. Be prepared that February is going to

424

00:09:06,940  -->  00:09:06,950

425

00:09:06,950  -->  00:09:10,390
be your worst month and that is because

426

00:09:10,390  -->  00:09:10,400

427

00:09:10,400  -->  00:09:12,640
everybody spent their money in December.

428

00:09:12,640  -->  00:09:12,650

429

00:09:12,650  -->  00:09:15,370
So that's not only retail, you've got

430

00:09:15,370  -->  00:09:15,380

431

00:09:15,380  -->  00:09:18,010
whatever got a department electronic,

432

00:09:18,010  -->  00:09:18,020

433

00:09:18,020  -->  00:09:20,380
food retailing, similar

434

00:09:20,380  -->  00:09:20,390

435

00:09:20,390  -->  00:09:24,640
patterns right? So liquor household

436

00:09:24,640  -->  00:09:24,650

437

00:09:24,650  -->  00:09:28,540
goods retailing another interesting

438

00:09:28,540  -->  00:09:28,550

439

00:09:28,550  -->  00:09:31,210
thing is disruption so we can observe

440

00:09:31,210  -->  00:09:31,220

441

00:09:31,220  -->  00:09:33,730
through these parents or through this

442

00:09:33,730  -->  00:09:33,740

443

00:09:33,740  -->  00:09:35,770
data how we visit visualize that we

444

00:09:35,770  -->  00:09:35,780

445

00:09:35,780  -->  00:09:38,020
can observe actual destruction of whole

446

00:09:38,020  -->  00:09:38,030

447

00:09:38,030  -->  00:09:40,780
industries and here you've got an

448

00:09:40,780  -->  00:09:40,790

449

00:09:40,790  -->  00:09:43,030
example a newspaper and book retailing.

450

00:09:43,030  -->  00:09:43,040

451

00:09:43,040  -->  00:09:48,400
So what happened as the technology is

452

00:09:48,400  -->  00:09:48,410

453

00:09:48,410  -->  00:09:49,900
progressing you can see that book

454

00:09:49,900  -->  00:09:49,910

455

00:09:49,910  -->  00:09:52,030
retailing was growing up until the early

456

00:09:52,030  -->  00:09:52,040

457

00:09:52,040  -->  00:09:54,790
nineties so in the nineties already

458

00:09:54,790  -->  00:09:54,800

459

00:09:54,800  -->  00:09:56,620
started flooding out computers got,

460

00:09:56,620  -->  00:09:56,630

461

00:09:56,630  -->  00:09:58,630
personal computers got introduced still

462

00:09:58,630  -->  00:09:58,640

463

00:09:58,640  -->  00:10:03,730
growing a bit and then in 1995 like it

464

00:10:03,730  -->  00:10:03,740

465

00:10:03,740  -->  00:10:05,500
start flattening out there was a bit of

466

00:10:05,500  -->  00:10:05,510

467

00:10:05,510  -->  00:10:09,250
growth here,newspapers and so on and

468

00:10:09,250  -->  00:10:09,260

469

00:10:09,260  -->  00:10:12,700
now since 2010 boom it's going all the

470

00:10:12,700  -->  00:10:12,710

471

00:10:12,710  -->  00:10:15,970
way down right? So there is destruction

472

00:10:15,970  -->  00:10:15,980

473

00:10:15,980  -->  00:10:18,610
of an industry happening in real time

474

00:10:18,610  -->  00:10:18,620

475

00:10:18,620  -->  00:10:20,620
and that is you know all the iPads,

476

00:10:20,620  -->  00:10:20,630

477

00:10:20,630  -->  00:10:23,110
iPhones. How internet's taking over so

478

00:10:23,110  -->  00:10:23,120

479

00:10:23,120  -->  00:10:25,570
newspapers and books are not selling as

480

00:10:25,570  -->  00:10:25,580

481

00:10:25,580  -->  00:10:28,600
well anymore it's going down so that's

482

00:10:28,600  -->  00:10:28,610

483

00:10:28,610  -->  00:10:31,630
an interesting insight as well. So feel

484

00:10:31,630  -->  00:10:31,640

485

00:10:31,640  -->  00:10:33,640
free to play around with that and have a

486

00:10:33,640  -->  00:10:33,650

487

00:10:33,650  -->  00:10:35,020
look at this data that's really

488

00:10:35,020  -->  00:10:35,030

489

00:10:35,030  -->  00:10:37,180
interesting look at the industry's maybe

490

00:10:37,180  -->  00:10:37,190

491

00:10:37,190  -->  00:10:39,580
you'll find an interested you work in an

492

00:10:39,580  -->  00:10:39,590

493

00:10:39,590  -->  00:10:41,740
industry you work in or your

494

00:10:41,740  -->  00:10:41,750

495

00:10:41,750  -->  00:10:43,450
friends working or an industry you're

496

00:10:43,450  -->  00:10:43,460

497

00:10:43,460  -->  00:10:46,030
interested in and have a look and see

498

00:10:46,030  -->  00:10:46,040

499

00:10:46,040  -->  00:10:49,810
what you can find what interesting

500

00:10:49,810  -->  00:10:49,820

501

00:10:49,820  -->  00:10:52,120
insights you can derive from here and we

502

00:10:52,120  -->  00:10:52,130

503

00:10:52,130  -->  00:10:54,010
will continue on with our analysis in

504

00:10:54,010  -->  00:10:54,020

505

00:10:54,020  -->  00:10:56,800
