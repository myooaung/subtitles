00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:05.000

2

00:00:05.000  -->  00:00:07.410
All right section 3 let's dig into the

3

00:00:07.410  -->  00:00:07.420

4

00:00:07.420  -->  00:00:08.249
challenge.

5

00:00:08.249  -->  00:00:08.259

6

00:00:08.259  -->  00:00:09.779
Are you excited about this? I'm

7

00:00:09.779  -->  00:00:09.789

8

00:00:09.789  -->  00:00:13.409
super excited. Okay Coal Mining let's start

9

00:00:13.409  -->  00:00:13.419

10

00:00:13.419  -->  00:00:15.299
with this question. What are the odds

11

00:00:15.299  -->  00:00:15.309

12

00:00:15.309  -->  00:00:18.030
that you are an expert in coal mining? I

13

00:00:18.030  -->  00:00:18.040

14

00:00:18.040  -->  00:00:21.000
would say probably 0.1%, no actually I

15

00:00:21.000  -->  00:00:21.010

16

00:00:21.010  -->  00:00:24.630
would say 0.01%, that's the chance

17

00:00:24.630  -->  00:00:24.640

18

00:00:24.640  -->  00:00:26.610
that you're an expert coal mining and

19

00:00:26.610  -->  00:00:26.620

20

00:00:26.620  -->  00:00:28.830
yet in this whole section throughout the

21

00:00:28.830  -->  00:00:28.840

22

00:00:28.840  -->  00:00:30.930
section we're going to be talking a lot

23

00:00:30.930  -->  00:00:30.940

24

00:00:30.940  -->  00:00:33.180
about coal mining and we will be

25

00:00:33.180  -->  00:00:33.190

26

00:00:33.190  -->  00:00:36.239
leveraging specific knowledge about coal

27

00:00:36.239  -->  00:00:36.249

28

00:00:36.249  -->  00:00:39.239
mining. So what that will show you is how

29

00:00:39.239  -->  00:00:39.249

30

00:00:39.249  -->  00:00:41.970
important domain knowledge is in the

31

00:00:41.970  -->  00:00:41.980

32

00:00:41.980  -->  00:00:44.309
work of a data scientist or a Tableau

33

00:00:44.309  -->  00:00:44.319

34

00:00:44.319  -->  00:00:46.919
analyst more importantly what you'll see

35

00:00:46.919  -->  00:00:46.929

36

00:00:46.929  -->  00:00:49.739
in this tutorial is how quickly we as

37

00:00:49.739  -->  00:00:49.749

38

00:00:49.749  -->  00:00:52.559
data scientists can develop this domain

39

00:00:52.559  -->  00:00:52.569

40

00:00:52.569  -->  00:00:55.020
knowledge to help us in our engagements

41

00:00:55.020  -->  00:00:55.030

42

00:00:55.030  -->  00:00:57.329
and that combined with your unique

43

00:00:57.329  -->  00:00:57.339

44

00:00:57.339  -->  00:00:58.950
data skills will allow you to

45

00:00:58.950  -->  00:00:58.960

46

00:00:58.960  -->  00:01:01.139
deliver incredible projects for

47

00:01:01.139  -->  00:01:01.149

48

00:01:01.149  -->  00:01:03.239
virtually any industry.

49

00:01:03.239  -->  00:01:03.249

50

00:01:03.249  -->  00:01:05.430
Alright let's jump straight into it, so

51

00:01:05.430  -->  00:01:05.440

52

00:01:05.440  -->  00:01:07.560
here's the challenge and there's lots of

53

00:01:07.560  -->  00:01:07.570

54

00:01:07.570  -->  00:01:09.630
text here but we'll skip all of it. The first

55

00:01:09.630  -->  00:01:09.640

56

00:01:09.640  -->  00:01:11.370
thing that jumps out of the image is of course

57

00:01:11.370  -->  00:01:11.380

58

00:01:11.380  -->  00:01:13.290
millions of dollars and makes it

59

00:01:13.290  -->  00:01:13.300

60

00:01:13.300  -->  00:01:15.000
exciting but we'll skip it for now

61

00:01:15.000  -->  00:01:15.010

62

00:01:15.010  -->  00:01:18.600
because there is a lot of information

63

00:01:18.600  -->  00:01:18.610

64

00:01:18.610  -->  00:01:20.340
here which we just cannot digest we

65

00:01:20.340  -->  00:01:20.350

66

00:01:20.350  -->  00:01:21.990
don't have the domain knowledge to

67

00:01:21.990  -->  00:01:22.000

68

00:01:22.000  -->  00:01:24.600
understand exactly what is being said

69

00:01:24.600  -->  00:01:24.610

70

00:01:24.610  -->  00:01:26.760
and what has been required of us and

71

00:01:26.760  -->  00:01:26.770

72

00:01:26.770  -->  00:01:28.230
also we're going to skip this page as

73

00:01:28.230  -->  00:01:28.240

74

00:01:28.240  -->  00:01:31.170
well. Let's jump into acquiring this

75

00:01:31.170  -->  00:01:31.180

76

00:01:31.180  -->  00:01:32.370
domain knowledge and you'll see how

77

00:01:32.370  -->  00:01:32.380

78

00:01:32.380  -->  00:01:34.260
quickly you can develop it.

79

00:01:34.260  -->  00:01:34.270

80

00:01:34.270  -->  00:01:36.930
Alright so here's Australia and as you

81

00:01:36.930  -->  00:01:36.940

82

00:01:36.940  -->  00:01:40.140
have already gathered I am assuming you

83

00:01:40.140  -->  00:01:40.150

84

00:01:40.150  -->  00:01:41.550
have already gathered I'm from Australia,

85

00:01:41.550  -->  00:01:41.560

86

00:01:41.560  -->  00:01:44.010
I'm from Brisbane this is where I'm

87

00:01:44.010  -->  00:01:44.020

88

00:01:44.020  -->  00:01:46.500
sitting right now as I'm recording this

89

00:01:46.500  -->  00:01:46.510

90

00:01:46.510  -->  00:01:50.040
video and here is the Bowen Basin is

91

00:01:50.040  -->  00:01:50.050

92

00:01:50.050  -->  00:01:51.930
highlighted in red. The Bowen Basin is

93

00:01:51.930  -->  00:01:51.940

94

00:01:51.940  -->  00:01:55.620
one of the biggest coal mining Basins in

95

00:01:55.620  -->  00:01:55.630

96

00:01:55.630  -->  00:01:57.270
the world, it's got lots of different

97

00:01:57.270  -->  00:01:57.280

98

00:01:57.280  -->  00:01:59.070
types of coal and Australian minds that

99

00:01:59.070  -->  00:01:59.080

100

00:01:59.080  -->  00:02:02.220
and exports lots of it to other

101

00:02:02.220  -->  00:02:02.230

102

00:02:02.230  -->  00:02:05.130
countries. Now this is what a Bowen Basin

103

00:02:05.130  -->  00:02:05.140

104

00:02:05.140  -->  00:02:09.300
coal mine looks like, there's like I said

105

00:02:09.300  -->  00:02:09.310

106

00:02:09.310  -->  00:02:10.800
there's lots of different types of coal

107

00:02:10.800  -->  00:02:10.810

108

00:02:10.810  -->  00:02:13.380
and the whole concept is that it is

109

00:02:13.380  -->  00:02:13.390

110

00:02:13.390  -->  00:02:15.480
mined by different companies and

111

00:02:15.480  -->  00:02:15.490

112

00:02:15.490  -->  00:02:17.010
this put onto trains which looks like

113

00:02:17.010  -->  00:02:17.020

114

00:02:17.020  -->  00:02:20.370
this and then this coal is sent off and

115

00:02:20.370  -->  00:02:20.380

116

00:02:20.380  -->  00:02:23.340
these trains they can be huge it can be

117

00:02:23.340  -->  00:02:23.350

118

00:02:23.350  -->  00:02:25.650
up to several kilometers in length and

119

00:02:25.650  -->  00:02:25.660

120

00:02:25.660  -->  00:02:28.110
they can carry all the way up to 10 or

121

00:02:28.110  -->  00:02:28.120

122

00:02:28.120  -->  00:02:32.460
even 12,000 tons of coal in a 1 train.

123

00:02:32.460  -->  00:02:32.470

124

00:02:32.470  -->  00:02:35.070
It's an incredible amount and they're

125

00:02:35.070  -->  00:02:35.080

126

00:02:35.080  -->  00:02:37.470
moving at very high speeds and they're

127

00:02:37.470  -->  00:02:37.480

128

00:02:37.480  -->  00:02:39.360
going and where are they going? Where are

129

00:02:39.360  -->  00:02:39.370

130

00:02:39.370  -->  00:02:41.130
these trains going? Well they're going

131

00:02:41.130  -->  00:02:41.140

132

00:02:41.140  -->  00:02:42.690
towards the ocean they're going towards

133

00:02:42.690  -->  00:02:42.700

134

00:02:42.700  -->  00:02:45.060
the coast, to get into a coal

135

00:02:45.060  -->  00:02:45.070

136

00:02:45.070  -->  00:02:48.210
terminal and then so that the coal will

137

00:02:48.210  -->  00:02:48.220

138

00:02:48.220  -->  00:02:50.070
be loaded onto ships and it will be

139

00:02:50.070  -->  00:02:50.080

140

00:02:50.080  -->  00:02:53.280
shipped off to the purchaser of that

141

00:02:53.280  -->  00:02:53.290

142

00:02:53.290  -->  00:02:56.520
coal. So where are these terminal is located?

143

00:02:56.520  -->  00:02:56.530

144

00:02:56.530  -->  00:02:59.400
Now in a, in the circle here you can see

145

00:02:59.400  -->  00:02:59.410

146

00:02:59.410  -->  00:03:01.590
one of the or several of the coal

147

00:03:01.590  -->  00:03:01.600

148

00:03:01.600  -->  00:03:03.570
terminals that are highlighted now in

149

00:03:03.570  -->  00:03:03.580

150

00:03:03.580  -->  00:03:05.370
this section we're going to be

151

00:03:05.370  -->  00:03:05.380

152

00:03:05.380  -->  00:03:08.700
pretending and I stress we're pretending

153

00:03:08.700  -->  00:03:08.710

154

00:03:08.710  -->  00:03:11.370
that we're working for a coal terminal

155

00:03:11.370  -->  00:03:11.380

156

00:03:11.380  -->  00:03:13.020
called the Dalrymple Bay Coal

157

00:03:13.020  -->  00:03:13.030

158

00:03:13.030  -->  00:03:15.660
Terminal and why I say pretending is

159

00:03:15.660  -->  00:03:15.670

160

00:03:15.670  -->  00:03:17.130
because everything that we're doing is

161

00:03:17.130  -->  00:03:17.140

162

00:03:17.140  -->  00:03:19.230
based on fake data, fake concepts,

163

00:03:19.230  -->  00:03:19.240

164

00:03:19.240  -->  00:03:23.910
it's all made up just for specifically

165

00:03:23.910  -->  00:03:23.920

166

00:03:23.920  -->  00:03:26.100
for our analytics training purposes. This

167

00:03:26.100  -->  00:03:26.110

168

00:03:26.110  -->  00:03:28.950
is just a an example has nothing to do

169

00:03:28.950  -->  00:03:28.960

170

00:03:28.960  -->  00:03:30.540
with the real life and hence, this

171

00:03:30.540  -->  00:03:30.550

172

00:03:30.550  -->  00:03:32.100
disclaimer here at the bottom,

173

00:03:32.100  -->  00:03:32.110

174

00:03:32.110  -->  00:03:33.960
this is a mockup assignment used

175

00:03:33.960  -->  00:03:33.970

176

00:03:33.970  -->  00:03:35.580
exclusively for analytics training

177

00:03:35.580  -->  00:03:35.590

178

00:03:35.590  -->  00:03:37.200
purposes. All data used for this

179

00:03:37.200  -->  00:03:37.210

180

00:03:37.210  -->  00:03:39.570
analysis is fake. There is no affiliation

181

00:03:39.570  -->  00:03:39.580

182

00:03:39.580  -->  00:03:41.940
with DBCT. So just so we're on the same

183

00:03:41.940  -->  00:03:41.950

184

00:03:41.950  -->  00:03:42.870
page.

185

00:03:42.870  -->  00:03:42.880

186

00:03:42.880  -->  00:03:45.390
This is a not real data we're doing this

187

00:03:45.390  -->  00:03:45.400

188

00:03:45.400  -->  00:03:47.910
just for training purposes.

189

00:03:47.910  -->  00:03:47.920

190

00:03:47.920  -->  00:03:50.340
Alright so the coal from the Bowen Basin

191

00:03:50.340  -->  00:03:50.350

192

00:03:50.350  -->  00:03:52.860
which is over here is outlined in this

193

00:03:52.860  -->  00:03:52.870

194

00:03:52.870  -->  00:03:54.690
square. It all,

195

00:03:54.690  -->  00:03:54.700

196

00:03:54.700  -->  00:03:58.740
well, a lot of it goes to this DBCT

197

00:03:58.740  -->  00:03:58.750

198

00:03:58.750  -->  00:04:00.630
Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal which is located

199

00:04:00.630  -->  00:04:00.640

200

00:04:00.640  -->  00:04:03.030
here near Mackay and I actually was in

201

00:04:03.030  -->  00:04:03.040

202

00:04:03.040  -->  00:04:06.330
Mackay was doing an engagement for a big

203

00:04:06.330  -->  00:04:06.340

204

00:04:06.340  -->  00:04:07.260
client there. Of course there's a

205

00:04:07.260  -->  00:04:07.270

206

00:04:07.270  -->  00:04:09.990
different client but I have been there

207

00:04:09.990  -->  00:04:10.000

208

00:04:10.000  -->  00:04:11.850
and I've seen the Dalrymple Bay

209

00:04:11.850  -->  00:04:11.860

210

00:04:11.860  -->  00:04:13.920
Coal Terminal and this is what it

211

00:04:13.920  -->  00:04:13.930

212

00:04:13.930  -->  00:04:14.580
looks like.

213

00:04:14.580  -->  00:04:14.590

214

00:04:14.590  -->  00:04:16.620
So this is the view you get when you're

215

00:04:16.620  -->  00:04:16.630

216

00:04:16.630  -->  00:04:18.840
flying in a plane from Brisbane to Mackay

217

00:04:18.840  -->  00:04:18.850

218

00:04:18.850  -->  00:04:21.840
or back, magnificent view isn't it?

219

00:04:21.840  -->  00:04:21.850

220

00:04:21.850  -->  00:04:24.240
And so this is the Dalrymple Bay Coal

221

00:04:24.240  -->  00:04:24.250

222

00:04:24.250  -->  00:04:26.670
Terminal and this is where the trains

223

00:04:26.670  -->  00:04:26.680

224

00:04:26.680  -->  00:04:29.140
pull up, well in fact they don't actually

225

00:04:29.140  -->  00:04:29.150

226

00:04:29.150  -->  00:04:31.450
pull up their still moving and while

227

00:04:31.450  -->  00:04:31.460

228

00:04:31.460  -->  00:04:32.800
they're moving they're being unloaded

229

00:04:32.800  -->  00:04:32.810

230

00:04:32.810  -->  00:04:36.010
over here and the coal goes down, these

231

00:04:36.010  -->  00:04:36.020

232

00:04:36.020  -->  00:04:39.280
conveyor belts to this Dockyard over

233

00:04:39.280  -->  00:04:39.290

234

00:04:39.290  -->  00:04:41.830
here where it is stock piled and then

235

00:04:41.830  -->  00:04:41.840

236

00:04:41.840  -->  00:04:44.830
after that it is sent down more conveyor

237

00:04:44.830  -->  00:04:44.840

238

00:04:44.840  -->  00:04:47.530
belts all the way to the jetty where it

239

00:04:47.530  -->  00:04:47.540

240

00:04:47.540  -->  00:04:50.200
is loaded onto ships and then ships go

241

00:04:50.200  -->  00:04:50.210

242

00:04:50.210  -->  00:04:52.750
back to the purchaser of the coal. Now

243

00:04:52.750  -->  00:04:52.760

244

00:04:52.760  -->  00:04:55.660
don't confuse there's another stockyard

245

00:04:55.660  -->  00:04:55.670

246

00:04:55.670  -->  00:04:58.570
over here but this stockyard belongs to

247

00:04:58.570  -->  00:04:58.580

248

00:04:58.580  -->  00:05:00.370
a different coal terminal, so this coal

249

00:05:00.370  -->  00:05:00.380

250

00:05:00.380  -->  00:05:03.010
terminal here is called the Hay Point Coal

251

00:05:03.010  -->  00:05:03.020

252

00:05:03.020  -->  00:05:07.540
Terminal and it belongs to be BMA and BMA stands for BHP Billiton

253

00:05:07.540  -->  00:05:07.550

254

00:05:07.550  -->  00:05:10.030
Mitsubishi Alliance so those 2

255

00:05:10.030  -->  00:05:10.040

256

00:05:10.040  -->  00:05:11.590
companies built their own coal

257

00:05:11.590  -->  00:05:11.600

258

00:05:11.600  -->  00:05:13.180
terminal as you can see they've got

259

00:05:13.180  -->  00:05:13.190

260

00:05:13.190  -->  00:05:14.860
their own carousel here with the trains

261

00:05:14.860  -->  00:05:14.870

262

00:05:14.870  -->  00:05:17.200
unload the coal and then it's got a

263

00:05:17.200  -->  00:05:17.210

264

00:05:17.210  -->  00:05:19.930
stockyard and they've got a Jetty over here

265

00:05:19.930  -->  00:05:19.940

266

00:05:19.940  -->  00:05:21.400
as well, we're going to be pretending

267

00:05:21.400  -->  00:05:21.410

268

00:05:21.410  -->  00:05:21.910
that we're working with the Dalrymple

269

00:05:21.910  -->  00:05:25.390
Bay Coal Terminal not the Hay Point Coal

270

00:05:25.390  -->  00:05:25.400

271

00:05:25.400  -->  00:05:26.140
Terminal.

272

00:05:26.140  -->  00:05:26.150

273

00:05:26.150  -->  00:05:27.760
Alright so what else do we have here?

274

00:05:27.760  -->  00:05:27.770

275

00:05:27.770  -->  00:05:30.310
This is how the coal terminal operates,

276

00:05:30.310  -->  00:05:30.320

277

00:05:30.320  -->  00:05:33.640
so trains come in, they're unloaded and

278

00:05:33.640  -->  00:05:33.650

279

00:05:33.650  -->  00:05:35.590
coal goes down the conveyor belts and

280

00:05:35.590  -->  00:05:35.600

281

00:05:35.600  -->  00:05:37.720
into the stockyard where these machines

282

00:05:37.720  -->  00:05:37.730

283

00:05:37.730  -->  00:05:39.820
as you can see here they stock pile them

284

00:05:39.820  -->  00:05:39.830

285

00:05:39.830  -->  00:05:41.650
and how do they stock pile them?

286

00:05:41.650  -->  00:05:41.660

287

00:05:41.660  -->  00:05:43.690
Well this is how they stock pile them.

288

00:05:43.690  -->  00:05:43.700

289

00:05:43.700  -->  00:05:48.070
Another real image from the DBCT terminal

290

00:05:48.070  -->  00:05:48.080

291

00:05:48.080  -->  00:05:50.950
and what you can see here is lots and

292

00:05:50.950  -->  00:05:50.960

293

00:05:50.960  -->  00:05:53.080
lots of coal that has been stock piled

294

00:05:53.080  -->  00:05:53.090

295

00:05:53.090  -->  00:05:56.800
into these apartments and why do the

296

00:05:56.800  -->  00:05:56.810

297

00:05:56.810  -->  00:05:58.330
machines into stock pile the coal? The

298

00:05:58.330  -->  00:05:58.340

299

00:05:58.340  -->  00:06:00.340
questions,  why can't the coal just be

300

00:06:00.340  -->  00:06:00.350

301

00:06:00.350  -->  00:06:03.670
sent directly to the Jetty? So let's go

302

00:06:03.670  -->  00:06:03.680

303

00:06:03.680  -->  00:06:04.720
back one slide,

304

00:06:04.720  -->  00:06:04.730

305

00:06:04.730  -->  00:06:06.700
sometimes the coal can be sent directly

306

00:06:06.700  -->  00:06:06.710

307

00:06:06.710  -->  00:06:08.200
to you, so you can see that the conveyor

308

00:06:08.200  -->  00:06:08.210

309

00:06:08.210  -->  00:06:10.330
belts can go around the machines and can

310

00:06:10.330  -->  00:06:10.340

311

00:06:10.340  -->  00:06:12.940
go off straight to the Jetty to the

312

00:06:12.940  -->  00:06:12.950

313

00:06:12.950  -->  00:06:15.880
ships but there are two issues first of

314

00:06:15.880  -->  00:06:15.890

315

00:06:15.890  -->  00:06:17.500
all maybe the ship the right ship isn't

316

00:06:17.500  -->  00:06:17.510

317

00:06:17.510  -->  00:06:18.880
there may be the right ship hasn't

318

00:06:18.880  -->  00:06:18.890

319

00:06:18.890  -->  00:06:22.840
arrived yet and the coal shouldn't be at

320

00:06:22.840  -->  00:06:22.850

321

00:06:22.850  -->  00:06:24.760
the Jetty yet there's a different ship

322

00:06:24.760  -->  00:06:24.770

323

00:06:24.770  -->  00:06:27.250
being loaded at the time, the other thing

324

00:06:27.250  -->  00:06:27.260

325

00:06:27.260  -->  00:06:30.490
is that train sometimes might be late so

326

00:06:30.490  -->  00:06:30.500

327

00:06:30.500  -->  00:06:31.930
you want to stock pile the coal in advance

328

00:06:31.930  -->  00:06:31.940

329

00:06:31.940  -->  00:06:33.580
the companies that are sending the coal

330

00:06:33.580  -->  00:06:33.590

331

00:06:33.590  -->  00:06:35.410
using these trains they want to bring

332

00:06:35.410  -->  00:06:35.420

333

00:06:35.420  -->  00:06:37.150
the coal in advance if they can so in

334

00:06:37.150  -->  00:06:37.160

335

00:06:37.160  -->  00:06:38.440
case the train is late

336

00:06:38.440  -->  00:06:38.450

337

00:06:38.450  -->  00:06:39.500
they're not paying

338

00:06:39.500  -->  00:06:39.510

339

00:06:39.510  -->  00:06:41.330
extra cash because these companies have

340

00:06:41.330  -->  00:06:41.340

341

00:06:41.340  -->  00:06:44.030
huge contracts with the ships and every

342

00:06:44.030  -->  00:06:44.040

343

00:06:44.040  -->  00:06:46.220
time, every minute of the ships time

344

00:06:46.220  -->  00:06:46.230

345

00:06:46.230  -->  00:06:48.650
that is standing there and it's delayed

346

00:06:48.650  -->  00:06:48.660

347

00:06:48.660  -->  00:06:51.320
is literally costing hundreds of

348

00:06:51.320  -->  00:06:51.330

349

00:06:51.330  -->  00:06:54.200
thousands of dollars for a minute and

350

00:06:54.200  -->  00:06:54.210

351

00:06:54.210  -->  00:06:55.640
the other thing is that there are

352

00:06:55.640  -->  00:06:55.650

353

00:06:55.650  -->  00:06:58.010
different types of coal so you cannot,

354

00:06:58.010  -->  00:06:58.020

355

00:06:58.020  -->  00:07:00.890
you can sometimes you can't just send

356

00:07:00.890  -->  00:07:00.900

357

00:07:00.900  -->  00:07:02.600
the coal you have to mix it has to be a

358

00:07:02.600  -->  00:07:02.610

359

00:07:02.610  -->  00:07:05.210
blend of a 2, 3 or many different types of

360

00:07:05.210  -->  00:07:05.220

361

00:07:05.220  -->  00:07:07.220
coal and that blending happens at the

362

00:07:07.220  -->  00:07:07.230

363

00:07:07.230  -->  00:07:09.890
Jetty but you need to have that

364

00:07:09.890  -->  00:07:09.900

365

00:07:09.900  -->  00:07:11.660
different those different types of coal

366

00:07:11.660  -->  00:07:11.670

367

00:07:11.670  -->  00:07:13.640
so there are stock piled in their own

368

00:07:13.640  -->  00:07:13.650

369

00:07:13.650  -->  00:07:15.620
piles different types of coal a

370

00:07:15.620  -->  00:07:15.630

371

00:07:15.630  -->  00:07:17.900
stock pile separately and then when the

372

00:07:17.900  -->  00:07:17.910

373

00:07:17.910  -->  00:07:19.700
time comes to mix them they're mixed at

374

00:07:19.700  -->  00:07:19.710

375

00:07:19.710  -->  00:07:22.250
the Jetty. So that is another reason why

376

00:07:22.250  -->  00:07:22.260

377

00:07:22.260  -->  00:07:23.960
you stock pile coals so as you can see

378

00:07:23.960  -->  00:07:23.970

379

00:07:23.970  -->  00:07:25.640
inevitably you're going to have to have

380

00:07:25.640  -->  00:07:25.650

381

00:07:25.650  -->  00:07:27.140
a stockyard and you're going to have to

382

00:07:27.140  -->  00:07:27.150

383

00:07:27.150  -->  00:07:30.800
stock pile coal. So there's a stockyard and

384

00:07:30.800  -->  00:07:30.810

385

00:07:30.810  -->  00:07:32.690
this is what the stockyard looks like

386

00:07:32.690  -->  00:07:32.700

387

00:07:32.700  -->  00:07:34.100
over here and we'll get back to this

388

00:07:34.100  -->  00:07:34.110

389

00:07:34.110  -->  00:07:36.440
image just down the track in a couple of

390

00:07:36.440  -->  00:07:36.450

391

00:07:36.450  -->  00:07:39.530
slide this here what we can see is the

392

00:07:39.530  -->  00:07:39.540

393

00:07:39.540  -->  00:07:41.600
conveyor belt going to the Jetty where

394

00:07:41.600  -->  00:07:41.610

395

00:07:41.610  -->  00:07:43.010
the ships are and this is an actual

396

00:07:43.010  -->  00:07:43.020

397

00:07:43.020  -->  00:07:46.880
photo so as you can see it's an

398

00:07:46.880  -->  00:07:46.890

399

00:07:46.890  -->  00:07:49.820
incredibly long conveyor belt and then

400

00:07:49.820  -->  00:07:49.830

401

00:07:49.830  -->  00:07:51.650
over here there's more machines that

402

00:07:51.650  -->  00:07:51.660

403

00:07:51.660  -->  00:07:53.960
mix the coal. So there's machines here

404

00:07:53.960  -->  00:07:53.970

405

00:07:53.970  -->  00:07:56.150
as you can see these machines they stock pile

406

00:07:56.150  -->  00:07:56.160

407

00:07:56.160  -->  00:07:58.340
the coal and there's more machines

408

00:07:58.340  -->  00:07:58.350

409

00:07:58.350  -->  00:08:00.260
here that mix the coal and make sure

410

00:08:00.260  -->  00:08:00.270

411

00:08:00.270  -->  00:08:03.110
that the coal

412

00:08:03.110  -->  00:08:03.120

413

00:08:03.120  -->  00:08:05.240
consistency is correct that's what the

414

00:08:05.240  -->  00:08:05.250

415

00:08:05.250  -->  00:08:07.160
client ordered and the clients can be

416

00:08:07.160  -->  00:08:07.170

417

00:08:07.170  -->  00:08:09.530
huge companies that can be countries

418

00:08:09.530  -->  00:08:09.540

419

00:08:09.540  -->  00:08:12.020
that can be government and once that

420

00:08:12.020  -->  00:08:12.030

421

00:08:12.030  -->  00:08:14.090
coal is correct

422

00:08:14.090  -->  00:08:14.100

423

00:08:14.100  -->  00:08:15.800
it's loaded onto the ships and then it

424

00:08:15.800  -->  00:08:15.810

425

00:08:15.810  -->  00:08:18.680
sent off. Okay I hope you getting excited

426

00:08:18.680  -->  00:08:18.690

427

00:08:18.690  -->  00:08:20.570
this like I can feel your excitement

428

00:08:20.570  -->  00:08:20.580

429

00:08:20.580  -->  00:08:23.570
through, through the computer and I hope

430

00:08:23.570  -->  00:08:23.580

431

00:08:23.580  -->  00:08:25.250
you can feel mine because this is going

432

00:08:25.250  -->  00:08:25.260

433

00:08:25.260  -->  00:08:27.230
to be an incredible engagement.

434

00:08:27.230  -->  00:08:27.240

435

00:08:27.240  -->  00:08:29.690
Alright so where are we up to, once again

436

00:08:29.690  -->  00:08:29.700

437

00:08:29.700  -->  00:08:32.270
this is the photo and you can see the

438

00:08:32.270  -->  00:08:32.280

439

00:08:32.280  -->  00:08:33.830
ships lined up over there. They're

440

00:08:33.830  -->  00:08:33.840

441

00:08:33.840  -->  00:08:37.820
waiting so this, this place this coal

442

00:08:37.820  -->  00:08:37.830

443

00:08:37.830  -->  00:08:40.520
terminal it operates 24/7 it doesn't

444

00:08:40.520  -->  00:08:40.530

445

00:08:40.530  -->  00:08:42.860
stop there is no public holidays, no

446

00:08:42.860  -->  00:08:42.870

447

00:08:42.870  -->  00:08:44.540
Christmas, no anything,

448

00:08:44.540  -->  00:08:44.550

449

00:08:44.550  -->  00:08:47.780
it works 24/7, 365 days a year,

450

00:08:47.780  -->  00:08:47.790

451

00:08:47.790  -->  00:08:50.720
night, day, no breaks nothing it has to

452

00:08:50.720  -->  00:08:50.730

453

00:08:50.730  -->  00:08:51.660
keep pumping because

454

00:08:51.660  -->  00:08:51.670

455

00:08:51.670  -->  00:08:53.760
the trains are coming, the ships are

456

00:08:53.760  -->  00:08:53.770

457

00:08:53.770  -->  00:08:56.220
waiting, the coal needs to be sent off

458

00:08:56.220  -->  00:08:56.230

459

00:08:56.230  -->  00:08:59.580
and there are, there is so much coal it

460

00:08:59.580  -->  00:08:59.590

461

00:08:59.590  -->  00:09:01.830
cost lots of money every minute that

462

00:09:01.830  -->  00:09:01.840

463

00:09:01.840  -->  00:09:05.130
this place doesn't work it's literally

464

00:09:05.130  -->  00:09:05.140

465

00:09:05.140  -->  00:09:08.010
millions of dollars of revenue that are

466

00:09:08.010  -->  00:09:08.020

467

00:09:08.020  -->  00:09:10.950
being lost off the bottom line of the

468

00:09:10.950  -->  00:09:10.960

469

00:09:10.960  -->  00:09:14.640
company. As you can imagine this is a

470

00:09:14.640  -->  00:09:14.650

471

00:09:14.650  -->  00:09:17.640
very very kind of stressful work and I

472

00:09:17.640  -->  00:09:17.650

473

00:09:17.650  -->  00:09:20.310
really did respect the management

474

00:09:20.310  -->  00:09:20.320

475

00:09:20.320  -->  00:09:22.860
because they have to run this whole

476

00:09:22.860  -->  00:09:22.870

477

00:09:22.870  -->  00:09:24.840
operation and manage both trains and

478

00:09:24.840  -->  00:09:24.850

479

00:09:24.850  -->  00:09:28.080
ships and stockyards and machines it is

480

00:09:28.080  -->  00:09:28.090

481

00:09:28.090  -->  00:09:29.430
just an incredible job that they're

482

00:09:29.430  -->  00:09:29.440

483

00:09:29.440  -->  00:09:33.120
doing so hats off to them and what does

484

00:09:33.120  -->  00:09:33.130

485

00:09:33.130  -->  00:09:35.550
that mean for us? Well that is slowly

486

00:09:35.550  -->  00:09:35.560

487

00:09:35.560  -->  00:09:37.830
leading us into our engagement, this

488

00:09:37.830  -->  00:09:37.840

489

00:09:37.840  -->  00:09:41.640
place works 24/7. So by the way that's

490

00:09:41.640  -->  00:09:41.650

491

00:09:41.650  -->  00:09:43.290
the ships waiting this is an

492

00:09:43.290  -->  00:09:43.300

493

00:09:43.300  -->  00:09:44.880
another actual photo there waiting to

494

00:09:44.880  -->  00:09:44.890

495

00:09:44.890  -->  00:09:47.100
get loaded these ships are massive. They

496

00:09:47.100  -->  00:09:47.110

497

00:09:47.110  -->  00:09:49.890
can carry between anywhere between

498

00:09:49.890  -->  00:09:49.900

499

00:09:49.900  -->  00:09:53.580
20,000 tons and 200,000 tons of

500

00:09:53.580  -->  00:09:53.590

501

00:09:53.590  -->  00:09:55.440
deadweight and deadweight includes all

502

00:09:55.440  -->  00:09:55.450

503

00:09:55.450  -->  00:09:57.360
the cargo, the ballast, all the people,

504

00:09:57.360  -->  00:09:57.370

505

00:09:57.370  -->  00:09:59.190
everything that's on the ship and that's,

506

00:09:59.190  -->  00:09:59.200

507

00:09:59.200  -->  00:10:00.870
that's huge.

508

00:10:00.870  -->  00:10:00.880

509

00:10:00.880  -->  00:10:03.060
So those ships loaded then they're sent

510

00:10:03.060  -->  00:10:03.070

511

00:10:03.070  -->  00:10:07.260
off. Now this place as we said operates

512

00:10:07.260  -->  00:10:07.270

513

00:10:07.270  -->  00:10:12.030
24/7 and they process 85 million tons of

514

00:10:12.030  -->  00:10:12.040

515

00:10:12.040  -->  00:10:14.850
coal per year, I dont know doesn't

516

00:10:14.850  -->  00:10:14.860

517

00:10:14.860  -->  00:10:17.700
probably sound like anything but that is

518

00:10:17.700  -->  00:10:17.710

519

00:10:17.710  -->  00:10:21.150
that is an incredible amount of coal

520

00:10:21.150  -->  00:10:21.160

521

00:10:21.160  -->  00:10:23.250
that is going through here and just

522

00:10:23.250  -->  00:10:23.260

523

00:10:23.260  -->  00:10:26.520
imagine one train is only about 10,000

524

00:10:26.520  -->  00:10:26.530

525

00:10:26.530  -->  00:10:29.130
tons that's and a ship maximum

526

00:10:29.130  -->  00:10:29.140

527

00:10:29.140  -->  00:10:31.440
capacity ship is about 200,000 tons so

528

00:10:31.440  -->  00:10:31.450

529

00:10:31.450  -->  00:10:34.500
this place is processing 85 million tons

530

00:10:34.500  -->  00:10:34.510

531

00:10:34.510  -->  00:10:35.580
of coal per year,

532

00:10:35.580  -->  00:10:35.590

533

00:10:35.590  -->  00:10:39.510
it's incredible. Anyway, so moving on that

534

00:10:39.510  -->  00:10:39.520

535

00:10:39.520  -->  00:10:41.490
what we are going to be talking about is

536

00:10:41.490  -->  00:10:41.500

537

00:10:41.500  -->  00:10:44.160
machines that work at the coal terminal.

538

00:10:44.160  -->  00:10:44.170

539

00:10:44.170  -->  00:10:46.740
We're going to be analyzing machines and

540

00:10:46.740  -->  00:10:46.750

541

00:10:46.750  -->  00:10:47.670
specifically we're going to be talking

542

00:10:47.670  -->  00:10:47.680

543

00:10:47.680  -->  00:10:50.310
about their maintenance and there are

544

00:10:50.310  -->  00:10:50.320

545

00:10:50.320  -->  00:10:52.620
three types of machines. There's this

546

00:10:52.620  -->  00:10:52.630

547

00:10:52.630  -->  00:10:54.060
machine that you see here is called a

548

00:10:54.060  -->  00:10:54.070

549

00:10:54.070  -->  00:10:57.000
stacker, it stacks up the coal into these

550

00:10:57.000  -->  00:10:57.010

551

00:10:57.010  -->  00:11:00.660
pyramids of a coal, then this machine

552

00:11:00.660  -->  00:11:00.670

553

00:11:00.670  -->  00:11:03.210
that you see here is a reclaimer its

554

00:11:03.210  -->  00:11:03.220

555

00:11:03.220  -->  00:11:05.290
uses its buckets while they spin

556

00:11:05.290  -->  00:11:05.300

557

00:11:05.300  -->  00:11:07.360
to reclaim the coal and send it back off

558

00:11:07.360  -->  00:11:07.370

559

00:11:07.370  -->  00:11:08.710
onto the conveyor when that coals

560

00:11:08.710  -->  00:11:08.720

561

00:11:08.720  -->  00:11:11.560
required and then this machine is a

562

00:11:11.560  -->  00:11:11.570

563

00:11:11.570  -->  00:11:14.440
stacker reclaimer, it can do both.

564

00:11:14.440  -->  00:11:14.450

565

00:11:14.450  -->  00:11:16.030
You can see the bucket so it can reclaim

566

00:11:16.030  -->  00:11:16.040

567

00:11:16.040  -->  00:11:17.650
but at the moment where you can see it's

568

00:11:17.650  -->  00:11:17.660

569

00:11:17.660  -->  00:11:20.620
doing is its stacking the coal into a

570

00:11:20.620  -->  00:11:20.630

571

00:11:20.630  -->  00:11:21.579
pyramid.

572

00:11:21.579  -->  00:11:21.589

573

00:11:21.589  -->  00:11:24.430
So it's kind of a two-way machine and

574

00:11:24.430  -->  00:11:24.440

575

00:11:24.440  -->  00:11:26.860
here you can see how the coal is sent

576

00:11:26.860  -->  00:11:26.870

577

00:11:26.870  -->  00:11:28.840
into the machine it's a sent through

578

00:11:28.840  -->  00:11:28.850

579

00:11:28.850  -->  00:11:30.190
this conveyor belt all that's the same

580

00:11:30.190  -->  00:11:30.200

581

00:11:30.200  -->  00:11:32.500
way it goes out when being reclaimed

582

00:11:32.500  -->  00:11:32.510

583

00:11:32.510  -->  00:11:35.740
and this is what the place looks like at

584

00:11:35.740  -->  00:11:35.750

585

00:11:35.750  -->  00:11:37.509
night so as you can imagine these

586

00:11:37.509  -->  00:11:37.519

587

00:11:37.519  -->  00:11:38.980
machines are working 24/7.

588

00:11:38.980  -->  00:11:38.990

589

00:11:38.990  -->  00:11:40.630
The whole place lights up like a

590

00:11:40.630  -->  00:11:40.640

591

00:11:40.640  -->  00:11:41.920
Christmas tree.

592

00:11:41.920  -->  00:11:41.930

593

00:11:41.930  -->  00:11:43.569
Everybody keeps working through the

594

00:11:43.569  -->  00:11:43.579

595

00:11:43.579  -->  00:11:46.690
night and this is how a machine is

596

00:11:46.690  -->  00:11:46.700

597

00:11:46.700  -->  00:11:49.420
working like a real time and look at him

598

00:11:49.420  -->  00:11:49.430

599

00:11:49.430  -->  00:11:52.030
go it is just insane how much power

600

00:11:52.030  -->  00:11:52.040

601

00:11:52.040  -->  00:11:53.920
there is in there and as you can imagine

602

00:11:53.920  -->  00:11:53.930

603

00:11:53.930  -->  00:11:57.069
these machines require maintenance area

604

00:11:57.069  -->  00:11:57.079

605

00:11:57.079  -->  00:11:59.290
they require service, but how are you

606

00:11:59.290  -->  00:11:59.300

607

00:11:59.300  -->  00:12:01.120
going to service them when this whole

608

00:12:01.120  -->  00:12:01.130

609

00:12:01.130  -->  00:12:03.069
place they can't stop they have to keep

610

00:12:03.069  -->  00:12:03.079

611

00:12:03.079  -->  00:12:05.920
working 24/7 because of the

612

00:12:05.920  -->  00:12:05.930

613

00:12:05.930  -->  00:12:07.960
every every minute of downtime is

614

00:12:07.960  -->  00:12:07.970

615

00:12:07.970  -->  00:12:09.400
millions of dollars you can just stop

616

00:12:09.400  -->  00:12:09.410

617

00:12:09.410  -->  00:12:11.319
them to assess whether they require

618

00:12:11.319  -->  00:12:11.329

619

00:12:11.329  -->  00:12:12.850
service, whether they require maintenance,

620

00:12:12.850  -->  00:12:12.860

621

00:12:12.860  -->  00:12:14.710
whether they need an oil change

622

00:12:14.710  -->  00:12:14.720

623

00:12:14.720  -->  00:12:16.600
or whatever they might need.

624

00:12:16.600  -->  00:12:16.610

625

00:12:16.610  -->  00:12:18.610
So how we going to go about that? We're

626

00:12:18.610  -->  00:12:18.620

627

00:12:18.620  -->  00:12:20.650
going to use analytics to find out

628

00:12:20.650  -->  00:12:20.660

629

00:12:20.660  -->  00:12:23.170
whether my machine requires maintenance

630

00:12:23.170  -->  00:12:23.180

631

00:12:23.180  -->  00:12:27.639
and what we what you see here is the all

632

00:12:27.639  -->  00:12:27.649

633

00:12:27.649  -->  00:12:29.860
the machines that are present in this

634

00:12:29.860  -->  00:12:29.870

635

00:12:29.870  -->  00:12:32.889
terminal, so you've got that RL is a

636

00:12:32.889  -->  00:12:32.899

637

00:12:32.899  -->  00:12:34.540
reclaimer there's two reclaim is over

638

00:12:34.540  -->  00:12:34.550

639

00:12:34.550  -->  00:12:37.090
here, then you've got the stackers these

640

00:12:37.090  -->  00:12:37.100

641

00:12:37.100  -->  00:12:40.329
are ST3, ST1, ST4 and then

642

00:12:40.329  -->  00:12:40.339

643

00:12:40.339  -->  00:12:41.860
you've got the rest which are stacker

644

00:12:41.860  -->  00:12:41.870

645

00:12:41.870  -->  00:12:43.569
reclaimer so that the combined machines

646

00:12:43.569  -->  00:12:43.579

647

00:12:43.579  -->  00:12:48.010
SR1, SR2, SR3A, 4A, 5 and 6 and

648

00:12:48.010  -->  00:12:48.020

649

00:12:48.020  -->  00:12:50.350
in this engagement you have been

650

00:12:50.350  -->  00:12:50.360

651

00:12:50.360  -->  00:12:53.410
assigned to analyze only the reclaimers,

652

00:12:53.410  -->  00:12:53.420

653

00:12:53.420  -->  00:12:55.960
so reclaimer 1, reclaimer 2 and any of

654

00:12:55.960  -->  00:12:55.970

655

00:12:55.970  -->  00:12:57.790
the machine stacker reclaim machines

656

00:12:57.790  -->  00:12:57.800

657

00:12:57.800  -->  00:13:00.910
that for the given month were working as

658

00:13:00.910  -->  00:13:00.920

659

00:13:00.920  -->  00:13:03.970
reclaimers so not stackers. You will be

660

00:13:03.970  -->  00:13:03.980

661

00:13:03.980  -->  00:13:05.680
looking at the data to assess

662

00:13:05.680  -->  00:13:05.690

663

00:13:05.690  -->  00:13:08.380
whether a specific machine requires a

664

00:13:08.380  -->  00:13:08.390

665

00:13:08.390  -->  00:13:10.750
maintenance or not and this leads us

666

00:13:10.750  -->  00:13:10.760

667

00:13:10.760  -->  00:13:13.930
back to the actual assignment so that's

668

00:13:13.930  -->  00:13:13.940

669

00:13:13.940  -->  00:13:15.639
how we develop domain knowledge and hope

670

00:13:15.639  -->  00:13:15.649

671

00:13:15.649  -->  00:13:17.680
you're all full of this domain knowledge

672

00:13:17.680  -->  00:13:17.690

673

00:13:17.690  -->  00:13:18.500
now and you

674

00:13:18.500  -->  00:13:18.510

675

00:13:18.510  -->  00:13:21.410
ready to absorb this information. So you

676

00:13:21.410  -->  00:13:21.420

677

00:13:21.420  -->  00:13:23.210
have been hired by Coal Terminal to

678

00:13:23.210  -->  00:13:23.220

679

00:13:23.220  -->  00:13:25.190
assess which of their Coal Reclaimer

680

00:13:25.190  -->  00:13:25.200

681

00:13:25.200  -->  00:13:26.690
machines require maintenance and

682

00:13:26.690  -->  00:13:26.700

683

00:13:26.700  -->  00:13:28.430
upcoming month. These machines run

684

00:13:28.430  -->  00:13:28.440

685

00:13:28.440  -->  00:13:31.730
literally around the clock 24/7 for 365 days

686

00:13:31.730  -->  00:13:31.740

687

00:13:31.740  -->  00:13:34.310
a year. Every minute of downtime equates

688

00:13:34.310  -->  00:13:34.320

689

00:13:34.320  -->  00:13:36.770
to millions of dollars lost revenue, that

690

00:13:36.770  -->  00:13:36.780

691

00:13:36.780  -->  00:13:39.350
is why it is crucial to identify exactly

692

00:13:39.350  -->  00:13:39.360

693

00:13:39.360  -->  00:13:40.850
when these machines require maintenance

694

00:13:40.850  -->  00:13:40.860

695

00:13:40.860  -->  00:13:43.400
neither less or more frequently is

696

00:13:43.400  -->  00:13:43.410

697

00:13:43.410  -->  00:13:45.260
acceptable so you cannot maintain them

698

00:13:45.260  -->  00:13:45.270

699

00:13:45.270  -->  00:13:46.910
more frequently or later the risks

700

00:13:46.910  -->  00:13:46.920

701

00:13:46.920  -->  00:13:49.940
frequently because both eitherly to

702

00:13:49.940  -->  00:13:49.950

703

00:13:49.950  -->  00:13:52.100
downtime or a dangerous situation.

704

00:13:52.100  -->  00:13:52.110

705

00:13:52.110  -->  00:13:54.590
Currently the Coal Terminal follows the

706

00:13:54.590  -->  00:13:54.600

707

00:13:54.600  -->  00:13:56.270
following criterion and by the way this

708

00:13:56.270  -->  00:13:56.280

709

00:13:56.280  -->  00:13:57.560
is all made up they might fall

710

00:13:57.560  -->  00:13:57.570

711

00:13:57.570  -->  00:13:59.690
completely different methodology but

712

00:13:59.690  -->  00:13:59.700

713

00:13:59.700  -->  00:14:02.030
nevertheless this is a very data-driven

714

00:14:02.030  -->  00:14:02.040

715

00:14:02.040  -->  00:14:05.180
approach so it's good for our example. A

716

00:14:05.180  -->  00:14:05.190

717

00:14:05.190  -->  00:14:06.560
reclaimer-type machine requires

718

00:14:06.560  -->  00:14:06.570

719

00:14:06.570  -->  00:14:08.360
maintenance when within the previous

720

00:14:08.360  -->  00:14:08.370

721

00:14:08.370  -->  00:14:11.120
month there was at least one 8-hour

722

00:14:11.120  -->  00:14:11.130

723

00:14:11.130  -->  00:14:13.880
period when the average idle capacity

724

00:14:13.880  -->  00:14:13.890

725

00:14:13.890  -->  00:14:17.720
was over 10%. So might be a  lot to

726

00:14:17.720  -->  00:14:17.730

727

00:14:17.730  -->  00:14:20.120
grasp but hold on to that and let's

728

00:14:20.120  -->  00:14:20.130

729

00:14:20.130  -->  00:14:21.020
power through it.

730

00:14:21.020  -->  00:14:21.030

731

00:14:21.030  -->  00:14:22.970
Let's go to the next page. Idle capacity

732

00:14:22.970  -->  00:14:22.980

733

00:14:22.980  -->  00:14:25.130
is a utilization metric which, for the

734

00:14:25.130  -->  00:14:25.140

735

00:14:25.140  -->  00:14:27.350
purposes of this project, is defined as:

736

00:14:27.350  -->  00:14:27.360

737

00:14:27.360  -->  00:14:29.510
Idle Capacity equals Actual Tonnage

738

00:14:29.510  -->  00:14:29.520

739

00:14:29.520  -->  00:14:32.630
minus Nominal Capacity divided by Nominal

740

00:14:32.630  -->  00:14:32.640

741

00:14:32.640  -->  00:14:35.870
Capacity. Now your task is to find out

742

00:14:35.870  -->  00:14:35.880

743

00:14:35.880  -->  00:14:37.940
which of the five machines have exceeded

744

00:14:37.940  -->  00:14:37.950

745

00:14:37.950  -->  00:14:40.790
this level and create a report for the

746

00:14:40.790  -->  00:14:40.800

747

00:14:40.800  -->  00:14:42.590
executive stakeholders with your

748

00:14:42.590  -->  00:14:42.600

749

00:14:42.600  -->  00:14:44.960
recommendations. So idle capacity is a

750

00:14:44.960  -->  00:14:44.970

751

00:14:44.970  -->  00:14:47.270
bad metric the the greater the idle

752

00:14:47.270  -->  00:14:47.280

753

00:14:47.280  -->  00:14:49.490
capacity the worst meaning the machine

754

00:14:49.490  -->  00:14:49.500

755

00:14:49.500  -->  00:14:51.230
is under utilized so here you can see

756

00:14:51.230  -->  00:14:51.240

757

00:14:51.240  -->  00:14:53.540
that actual tonnage is the utilization

758

00:14:53.540  -->  00:14:53.550

759

00:14:53.550  -->  00:14:55.340
of the Machine and these machines can

760

00:14:55.340  -->  00:14:55.350

761

00:14:55.350  -->  00:14:57.710
process you around like four and a half

762

00:14:57.710  -->  00:14:57.720

763

00:14:57.720  -->  00:15:01.370
thousand tons of coal per hour so if

764

00:15:01.370  -->  00:15:01.380

765

00:15:01.380  -->  00:15:03.260
this is four and a half thousand tons

766

00:15:03.260  -->  00:15:03.270

767

00:15:03.270  -->  00:15:04.550
now this is four-and-a-half tiles and

768

00:15:04.550  -->  00:15:04.560

769

00:15:04.560  -->  00:15:06.080
tons and your actual tonnage for that

770

00:15:06.080  -->  00:15:06.090

771

00:15:06.090  -->  00:15:08.390
our let's say was 3,000 tons, then

772

00:15:08.390  -->  00:15:08.400

773

00:15:08.400  -->  00:15:10.250
difference here is 1 minus 1 and a

774

00:15:10.250  -->  00:15:10.260

775

00:15:10.260  -->  00:15:12.260
half thousand divided by 4 and a half

776

00:15:12.260  -->  00:15:12.270

777

00:15:12.270  -->  00:15:14.690
thousand makes it minus 33%

778

00:15:14.690  -->  00:15:14.700

779

00:15:14.700  -->  00:15:17.390
so that is the idle capacity for

780

00:15:17.390  -->  00:15:17.400

781

00:15:17.400  -->  00:15:19.850
that hour so idle meaning unused

782

00:15:19.850  -->  00:15:19.860

783

00:15:19.860  -->  00:15:20.360
capacity for that our was 33%

784

00:15:20.360  -->  00:15:22.280

785

00:15:22.280  -->  00:15:25.490
percent and so what we're looking for is

786

00:15:25.490  -->  00:15:25.500

787

00:15:25.500  -->  00:15:29.060
any machine that had an 8

788

00:15:29.060  -->  00:15:29.070

789

00:15:29.070  -->  00:15:31.310
consecutive hours with average of the

790

00:15:31.310  -->  00:15:31.320

791

00:15:31.320  -->  00:15:31.730
idle

792

00:15:31.730  -->  00:15:31.740

793

00:15:31.740  -->  00:15:33.890
capacity was over 10% so if

794

00:15:33.890  -->  00:15:33.900

795

00:15:33.900  -->  00:15:35.540
there's a one-hour spike no problem but

796

00:15:35.540  -->  00:15:35.550

797

00:15:35.550  -->  00:15:38.270
if it was if average for 8 hours increase

798

00:15:38.270  -->  00:15:38.280

799

00:15:38.280  -->  00:15:41.540
it here exceeded 10% then that

800

00:15:41.540  -->  00:15:41.550

801

00:15:41.550  -->  00:15:43.580
machine requires maintenance something

802

00:15:43.580  -->  00:15:43.590

803

00:15:43.590  -->  00:15:45.950
is wrong with that machine. So that is

804

00:15:45.950  -->  00:15:45.960

805

00:15:45.960  -->  00:15:48.290
how we are going to use data to

806

00:15:48.290  -->  00:15:48.300

807

00:15:48.300  -->  00:15:52.760
identify if this complex operation is

808

00:15:52.760  -->  00:15:52.770

809

00:15:52.770  -->  00:15:55.550
working to par and specifically if

810

00:15:55.550  -->  00:15:55.560

811

00:15:55.560  -->  00:15:58.100
these machines require maintenance. Isn't

812

00:15:58.100  -->  00:15:58.110

813

00:15:58.110  -->  00:15:59.480
that exciting? We're going to be using

814

00:15:59.480  -->  00:15:59.490

815

00:15:59.490  -->  00:16:02.330
data to assess the performance of

816

00:16:02.330  -->  00:16:02.340

817

00:16:02.340  -->  00:16:05.180
machines that are so complex like we

818

00:16:05.180  -->  00:16:05.190

819

00:16:05.190  -->  00:16:06.830
don't know anything about in our

820

00:16:06.830  -->  00:16:06.840

821

00:16:06.840  -->  00:16:08.600
engineers we never built these machines

822

00:16:08.600  -->  00:16:08.610

823

00:16:08.610  -->  00:16:10.010
we've never been inside these machines

824

00:16:10.010  -->  00:16:10.020

825

00:16:10.020  -->  00:16:13.460
and yet we will be able to tell using

826

00:16:13.460  -->  00:16:13.470

827

00:16:13.470  -->  00:16:14.780
data whether they can require

828

00:16:14.780  -->  00:16:14.790

829

00:16:14.790  -->  00:16:16.280
maintenance or not

830

00:16:16.280  -->  00:16:16.290

831

00:16:16.290  -->  00:16:17.900
and moreover as you'll see throughout

832

00:16:17.900  -->  00:16:17.910

833

00:16:17.910  -->  00:16:20.900
the section by the way spoiler alert, you

834

00:16:20.900  -->  00:16:20.910

835

00:16:20.910  -->  00:16:22.820
will be able you will see how will be

836

00:16:22.820  -->  00:16:22.830

837

00:16:22.830  -->  00:16:25.190
able to predict the future, we'll be able

838

00:16:25.190  -->  00:16:25.200

839

00:16:25.200  -->  00:16:29.300
to predict if in the coming weeks or in

840

00:16:29.300  -->  00:16:29.310

841

00:16:29.310  -->  00:16:32.750
the coming month the machine will start

842

00:16:32.750  -->  00:16:32.760

843

00:16:32.760  -->  00:16:36.080
under performing and that by on its own

844

00:16:36.080  -->  00:16:36.090

845

00:16:36.090  -->  00:16:38.060
is incredible. That is the power of data

846

00:16:38.060  -->  00:16:38.070

847

00:16:38.070  -->  00:16:40.370
mining and all of that you'll experience

848

00:16:40.370  -->  00:16:40.380

849

00:16:40.380  -->  00:16:42.950
in this section of the course and I look

850

00:16:42.950  -->  00:16:42.960

851

00:16:42.960  -->  00:16:44.090
forward to seeing in the first tutorial.

852

00:16:44.090  -->  00:16:44.100

853

00:16:44.100  -->  00:16:46.400
Let's get this thing started,

854

00:16:46.400  -->  00:16:46.410

855

00:16:46.410  -->  00:16:53.510
and until then, Happy Analyzing.
