1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,800
Section recap.

2

00:00:06,800  -->  00:00:06,810

3

00:00:06,810  -->  00:00:08,390
Alright so what did we learn this

4

00:00:08,390  -->  00:00:08,400

5

00:00:08,400  -->  00:00:10,430
section was saturated with knowledge we

6

00:00:10,430  -->  00:00:10,440

7

00:00:10,440  -->  00:00:12,169
had lots and lots of different topics

8

00:00:12,169  -->  00:00:12,179

9

00:00:12,179  -->  00:00:14,720
let's recap on them very quickly.

10

00:00:14,720  -->  00:00:14,730

11

00:00:14,730  -->  00:00:16,460
First, we learned how to create groups.

12

00:00:16,460  -->  00:00:16,470

13

00:00:16,470  -->  00:00:18,140
It's a useful feature if you want to

14

00:00:18,140  -->  00:00:18,150

15

00:00:18,150  -->  00:00:20,929
affect the metadata that Tableau will be

16

00:00:20,929  -->  00:00:20,939

17

00:00:20,939  -->  00:00:24,679
working with and in a way merge the

18

00:00:24,679  -->  00:00:24,689

19

00:00:24,689  -->  00:00:26,359
two categories or multiple categories

20

00:00:26,359  -->  00:00:26,369

21

00:00:26,369  -->  00:00:28,970
within one field and we understood

22

00:00:28,970  -->  00:00:28,980

23

00:00:28,980  -->  00:00:32,659
exactly how groups work and that how

24

00:00:32,659  -->  00:00:32,669

25

00:00:32,669  -->  00:00:35,240
this affects segregation and that you

26

00:00:35,240  -->  00:00:35,250

27

00:00:35,250  -->  00:00:38,150
are safe to proceed with things like

28

00:00:38,150  -->  00:00:38,160

29

00:00:38,160  -->  00:00:41,510
averages and sums and so on when you're

30

00:00:41,510  -->  00:00:41,520

31

00:00:41,520  -->  00:00:43,610
using groups. And then we talked about

32

00:00:43,610  -->  00:00:43,620

33

00:00:43,620  -->  00:00:46,040
groups versus sets and the main key

34

00:00:46,040  -->  00:00:46,050

35

00:00:46,050  -->  00:00:48,229
difference here was that groups allow

36

00:00:48,229  -->  00:00:48,239

37

00:00:48,239  -->  00:00:52,220
you to control metadata of your data set

38

00:00:52,220  -->  00:00:52,230

39

00:00:52,230  -->  00:00:55,760
and sets are like filters which you can

40

00:00:55,760  -->  00:00:55,770

41

00:00:55,770  -->  00:00:57,439
put in your pocket and carry around with

42

00:00:57,439  -->  00:00:57,449

43

00:00:57,449  -->  00:01:00,229
you and use as your convenience in

44

00:01:00,229  -->  00:01:00,239

45

00:01:00,239  -->  00:01:02,389
different scenarios for different

46

00:01:02,389  -->  00:01:02,399

47

00:01:02,399  -->  00:01:04,910
purposes. Then we talked about static

48

00:01:04,910  -->  00:01:04,920

49

00:01:04,920  -->  00:01:06,980
set so there are two types of sets

50

00:01:06,980  -->  00:01:06,990

51

00:01:06,990  -->  00:01:09,350
generics, static and dynamic sets. Static

52

00:01:09,350  -->  00:01:09,360

53

00:01:09,360  -->  00:01:12,350
sets are very quick. You can create them in

54

00:01:12,350  -->  00:01:12,360

55

00:01:12,360  -->  00:01:15,380
your visualization right on the chart

56

00:01:15,380  -->  00:01:15,390

57

00:01:15,390  -->  00:01:17,660
but they do have the disadvantage that

58

00:01:17,660  -->  00:01:17,670

59

00:01:17,670  -->  00:01:20,420
they don't adapt to changes in your

60

00:01:20,420  -->  00:01:20,430

61

00:01:20,430  -->  00:01:22,850
data or changes in the requirements

62

00:01:22,850  -->  00:01:22,860

63

00:01:22,860  -->  00:01:24,800
of your analysis. Dynamic sets on the

64

00:01:24,800  -->  00:01:24,810

65

00:01:24,810  -->  00:01:25,969
other hand don't have those

66

00:01:25,969  -->  00:01:25,979

67

00:01:25,979  -->  00:01:28,520
disadvantages and that makes them so

68

00:01:28,520  -->  00:01:28,530

69

00:01:28,530  -->  00:01:30,920
much more powerful as you could see. Well

70

00:01:30,920  -->  00:01:30,930

71

00:01:30,930  -->  00:01:32,450
for most of this section we were working

72

00:01:32,450  -->  00:01:32,460

73

00:01:32,460  -->  00:01:34,249
with dynamic sets and they allowed us to

74

00:01:34,249  -->  00:01:34,259

75

00:01:34,259  -->  00:01:37,340
create some fantastic visuals. Then we

76

00:01:37,340  -->  00:01:37,350

77

00:01:37,350  -->  00:01:39,230
learned about combining sets, if you have

78

00:01:39,230  -->  00:01:39,240

79

00:01:39,240  -->  00:01:42,380
two sets that are based on the same

80

00:01:42,380  -->  00:01:42,390

81

00:01:42,390  -->  00:01:44,270
dimension then you can use them together

82

00:01:44,270  -->  00:01:44,280

83

00:01:44,280  -->  00:01:47,929
to combine and create a third set and

84

00:01:47,929  -->  00:01:47,939

85

00:01:47,939  -->  00:01:50,420
you can put some rules around whether it

86

00:01:50,420  -->  00:01:50,430

87

00:01:50,430  -->  00:01:52,010
includes everything that's in both the

88

00:01:52,010  -->  00:01:52,020

89

00:01:52,020  -->  00:01:55,639
set includes the overlap of the two sets

90

00:01:55,639  -->  00:01:55,649

91

00:01:55,649  -->  00:01:59,330
or other scenarios. Then we looked at

92

00:01:59,330  -->  00:01:59,340

93

00:01:59,340  -->  00:02:01,580
controlling sets with parameters and as

94

00:02:01,580  -->  00:02:01,590

95

00:02:01,590  -->  00:02:03,289
you can see this combination of sets

96

00:02:03,289  -->  00:02:03,299

97

00:02:03,299  -->  00:02:06,080
and parameters is extremely powerful if

98

00:02:06,080  -->  00:02:06,090

99

00:02:06,090  -->  00:02:07,969
sets by themselves are like fire than

100

00:02:07,969  -->  00:02:07,979

101

00:02:07,979  -->  00:02:10,339
adding parameters to set is like pouring

102

00:02:10,339  -->  00:02:10,349

103

00:02:10,349  -->  00:02:12,800
gasoline over the fire and allows you to

104

00:02:12,800  -->  00:02:12,810

105

00:02:12,810  -->  00:02:13,620
create

106

00:02:13,620  -->  00:02:13,630

107

00:02:13,630  -->  00:02:15,870
such powerful visuals and such

108

00:02:15,870  -->  00:02:15,880

109

00:02:15,880  -->  00:02:19,020
responsive dashboards. It's truly amazing.

110

00:02:19,020  -->  00:02:19,030

111

00:02:19,030  -->  00:02:20,850
Then we talked about creating assets

112

00:02:20,850  -->  00:02:20,860

113

00:02:20,860  -->  00:02:24,510
using formulas so which is also an

114

00:02:24,510  -->  00:02:24,520

115

00:02:24,520  -->  00:02:27,840
advanced tool in your arsenal now, you

116

00:02:27,840  -->  00:02:27,850

117

00:02:27,850  -->  00:02:30,930
can specify exactly what's that you want

118

00:02:30,930  -->  00:02:30,940

119

00:02:30,940  -->  00:02:33,720
using formulas and different fields of

120

00:02:33,720  -->  00:02:33,730

121

00:02:33,730  -->  00:02:36,180
your data set. So those are the main

122

00:02:36,180  -->  00:02:36,190

123

00:02:36,190  -->  00:02:37,560
things that we learned in this section

124

00:02:37,560  -->  00:02:37,570

125

00:02:37,570  -->  00:02:39,930
that was what section was focused on but

126

00:02:39,930  -->  00:02:39,940

127

00:02:39,940  -->  00:02:41,340
along the way we actually learned quite

128

00:02:41,340  -->  00:02:41,350

129

00:02:41,350  -->  00:02:43,620
a lot of other things and here's a quick

130

00:02:43,620  -->  00:02:43,630

131

00:02:43,630  -->  00:02:44,730
list of those things.

132

00:02:44,730  -->  00:02:44,740

133

00:02:44,740  -->  00:02:46,590
Additionally we learned number one, how

134

00:02:46,590  -->  00:02:46,600

135

00:02:46,600  -->  00:02:49,800
to create folders. Folders value to clean

136

00:02:49,800  -->  00:02:49,810

137

00:02:49,810  -->  00:02:53,100
up your workspace. Number two is how to

138

00:02:53,100  -->  00:02:53,110

139

00:02:53,110  -->  00:02:56,160
set default properties for fields and

140

00:02:56,160  -->  00:02:56,170

141

00:02:56,170  -->  00:02:58,680
that is also a star here because I think

142

00:02:58,680  -->  00:02:58,690

143

00:02:58,690  -->  00:03:01,500
that that is a very useful technique

144

00:03:01,500  -->  00:03:01,510

145

00:03:01,510  -->  00:03:04,500
that will help you in your future

146

00:03:04,500  -->  00:03:04,510

147

00:03:04,510  -->  00:03:07,350
dashboards and visualizations because it

148

00:03:07,350  -->  00:03:07,360

149

00:03:07,360  -->  00:03:09,270
saves time you don't have to format that

150

00:03:09,270  -->  00:03:09,280

151

00:03:09,280  -->  00:03:10,350
field every single time you just

152

00:03:10,350  -->  00:03:10,360

153

00:03:10,360  -->  00:03:11,820
format it once and we saw that on the

154

00:03:11,820  -->  00:03:11,830

155

00:03:11,830  -->  00:03:14,310
example of a growth which had to be a

156

00:03:14,310  -->  00:03:14,320

157

00:03:14,320  -->  00:03:15,750
percentage every single time we used it.

158

00:03:15,750  -->  00:03:15,760

159

00:03:15,760  -->  00:03:18,510
Then we learned how to use two

160

00:03:18,510  -->  00:03:18,520

161

00:03:18,520  -->  00:03:20,520
dimensions or sets in color. Another star

162

00:03:20,520  -->  00:03:20,530

163

00:03:20,530  -->  00:03:22,350
here because it's a very very useful

164

00:03:22,350  -->  00:03:22,360

165

00:03:22,360  -->  00:03:24,810
feature and not many people use it, not

166

00:03:24,810  -->  00:03:24,820

167

00:03:24,820  -->  00:03:26,820
many people know about it.

168

00:03:26,820  -->  00:03:26,830

169

00:03:26,830  -->  00:03:29,070
You now know about it and it will

170

00:03:29,070  -->  00:03:29,080

171

00:03:29,080  -->  00:03:32,850
definitely help you out sometimes so we

172

00:03:32,850  -->  00:03:32,860

173

00:03:32,860  -->  00:03:35,820
saw how we could add three colors into

174

00:03:35,820  -->  00:03:35,830

175

00:03:35,830  -->  00:03:40,230
our dashboard gray, blue and red, using

176

00:03:40,230  -->  00:03:40,240

177

00:03:40,240  -->  00:03:44,220
two different sets that we dragged into

178

00:03:44,220  -->  00:03:44,230

179

00:03:44,230  -->  00:03:48,150
the the color button. Next we saw how to

180

00:03:48,150  -->  00:03:48,160

181

00:03:48,160  -->  00:03:50,970
add reference lines so probably another

182

00:03:50,970  -->  00:03:50,980

183

00:03:50,980  -->  00:03:52,590
star should have been here, reference

184

00:03:52,590  -->  00:03:52,600

185

00:03:52,600  -->  00:03:54,900
lines are very useful and we actually

186

00:03:54,900  -->  00:03:54,910

187

00:03:54,910  -->  00:03:56,880
saw how to control reference lines with

188

00:03:56,880  -->  00:03:56,890

189

00:03:56,890  -->  00:04:00,030
parameters. Then we talked about how to

190

00:04:00,030  -->  00:04:00,040

191

00:04:00,040  -->  00:04:02,250
add a drop lines, so drop lines allow you

192

00:04:02,250  -->  00:04:02,260

193

00:04:02,260  -->  00:04:05,190
to help the user remember we're always

194

00:04:05,190  -->  00:04:05,200

195

00:04:05,200  -->  00:04:07,320
thinking about the user help the user

196

00:04:07,320  -->  00:04:07,330

197

00:04:07,330  -->  00:04:11,520
see where on the axis a certain element

198

00:04:11,520  -->  00:04:11,530

199

00:04:11,530  -->  00:04:14,610
of the scatterplot actually lies and not

200

00:04:14,610  -->  00:04:14,620

201

00:04:14,620  -->  00:04:15,930
only scatterplots you can also apply

202

00:04:15,930  -->  00:04:15,940

203

00:04:15,940  -->  00:04:18,780
drop lines to other visualizations. Then

204

00:04:18,780  -->  00:04:18,790

205

00:04:18,790  -->  00:04:21,150
we saw how to create useful tool tips so

206

00:04:21,150  -->  00:04:21,160

207

00:04:21,160  -->  00:04:24,810
not just tooltips that give real like

208

00:04:24,810  -->  00:04:24,820

209

00:04:24,820  -->  00:04:27,540
random information to these and we saw

210

00:04:27,540  -->  00:04:27,550

211

00:04:27,550  -->  00:04:30,450
how to customize our tool tips so that

212

00:04:30,450  -->  00:04:30,460

213

00:04:30,460  -->  00:04:33,120
they provide the very insightful

214

00:04:33,120  -->  00:04:33,130

215

00:04:33,130  -->  00:04:34,980
information the user is looking for and

216

00:04:34,980  -->  00:04:34,990

217

00:04:34,990  -->  00:04:37,950
they also look fantastic. And finally we

218

00:04:37,950  -->  00:04:37,960

219

00:04:37,960  -->  00:04:39,720
talked a lot about aesthetics and best

220

00:04:39,720  -->  00:04:39,730

221

00:04:39,730  -->  00:04:41,700
practices and off the top of my head I

222

00:04:41,700  -->  00:04:41,710

223

00:04:41,710  -->  00:04:44,460
can remember two stars being in there. We

224

00:04:44,460  -->  00:04:44,470

225

00:04:44,470  -->  00:04:46,470
talked about how to fix up your color

226

00:04:46,470  -->  00:04:46,480

227

00:04:46,480  -->  00:04:49,560
range so that it doesn't start from a

228

00:04:49,560  -->  00:04:49,570

229

00:04:49,570  -->  00:04:51,180
certain value actually starts from zero

230

00:04:51,180  -->  00:04:51,190

231

00:04:51,190  -->  00:04:52,890
working nonstop from a negative value so

232

00:04:52,890  -->  00:04:52,900

233

00:04:52,900  -->  00:04:55,770
you adjust your color range to what you

234

00:04:55,770  -->  00:04:55,780

235

00:04:55,780  -->  00:04:58,020
want to see and we talked about dynamic

236

00:04:58,020  -->  00:04:58,030

237

00:04:58,030  -->  00:05:02,370
text in your dashboard which also helps

238

00:05:02,370  -->  00:05:02,380

239

00:05:02,380  -->  00:05:04,050
the user understand what's going on

240

00:05:04,050  -->  00:05:04,060

241

00:05:04,060  -->  00:05:06,180
because that text is affected by the

242

00:05:06,180  -->  00:05:06,190

243

00:05:06,190  -->  00:05:08,970
parameter that he is changing. So there

244

00:05:08,970  -->  00:05:08,980

245

00:05:08,980  -->  00:05:10,740
we go that's everything we learned, as

246

00:05:10,740  -->  00:05:10,750

247

00:05:10,750  -->  00:05:13,290
you can see very very saturated section.

248

00:05:13,290  -->  00:05:13,300

249

00:05:13,300  -->  00:05:16,590
I hope you truly enjoyed it and had fun

250

00:05:16,590  -->  00:05:16,600

251

00:05:16,600  -->  00:05:18,540
along the way. We did create a beautiful

252

00:05:18,540  -->  00:05:18,550

253

00:05:18,550  -->  00:05:21,360
visualization towards the end and thank

254

00:05:21,360  -->  00:05:21,370

255

00:05:21,370  -->  00:05:22,410
you for your attention.

256

00:05:22,410  -->  00:05:22,420

257

00:05:22,420  -->  00:05:25,110
I look forward to seeing you on the next

258

00:05:25,110  -->  00:05:25,120

259

00:05:25,120  -->  00:05:27,450
section of the course. Until then, happy

260

00:05:27,450  -->  00:05:27,460

261

00:05:27,460  -->  00:05:33,060
analyzing.
