1
00:00:00,246 --> 00:00:04,326
Now finally let's see what happens when an async request times out.

2
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:08,122
Time outs are used to ensure that our threads are giving up if the

3
00:00:08,122 --> 00:00:11,266
work is not complete inside a reasonable time,

4
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:14,276
whatever that means for the application.

5
00:00:14,276 --> 00:00:25,246
So back in the FirstAsyncServlet, set a time out of 3 seconds on the context.

6
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:29,266
Then in the start method, let's put the threads to sleep for 5 seconds.

7
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:33,336
We can redeploy, refresh the browser, and look in the log file.

8
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:36,336
Now we can see the onTimeout message logged.

9
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:40,336
This means that we get told when a request has exceeded its time limit,

10
00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:44,256
and inside this handler we can do some processing,

11
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:45,336
in this case logging a message,

12
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:52,000
but we can also do some other error handling here that means something in this particular context.
