00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:05.308
So as we've seen,

2
00:00:05.308 --> 00:00:08.034
the Java Standard Tag Library provides a set of core tags

3
00:00:08.034 --> 00:00:11.014
that we can use within the application, and these are very useful.

4
00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:14.348
They provide a very basic set of functionality that

5
00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.964
comes in use over and over again.

6
00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:20.637
So these tags give page authors some control over view logic,

7
00:00:20.637 --> 00:00:24.964
and you prefer to use these rather than including script in the page,

8
00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:27.954
but that script in our case would be Java.

9
00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:30.871
They also allow far better control over things like URLs,

10
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:35.974
so we can now get application-relative URLs.

11
00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:37.984
There are other things within the tag library,

12
00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:39.964
but these are used less frequently.

13
00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:45.004
For example, there are a set of SQL tags, and there are a set of XML tags.

14
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:46.984
Depending on the sort of application you're writing,

15
00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:48.112
these may come in use,

16
00:00:48.112 --> 00:00:57.000
but if you're writing a typical model-view-controller MVC application, then you would not use these tags.
