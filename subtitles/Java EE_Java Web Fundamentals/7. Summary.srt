1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,459
So, certain things to be aware of with listeners.

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:07,449
If inside our listener code we throw an exception,

3
00:00:07,449 --> 00:00:11,004
then the exception gets passed to the application to

4
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:13,439
handle and no more listeners get fired.

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,389
If the exception is initialized by the container,

6
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:20,429
for example the application startup that's an exception that gets thrown,

7
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:23,469
these exceptions aren't handled by the application,

8
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:27,122
but they may cause the container to make the application unavailable,

9
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:31,439
and in this case the container will return a 500 status code,

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,429
so the client knows that it can no longer use the application.

11
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:42,459
So in summary, web applications fire events that we may be interested in,

12
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:48,429
and an event listener can respond to these events.

13
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:51,389
There are application, session, request,

14
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:55,459
start and end events, as well as various attribute events,

15
00:00:55,459 --> 00:01:02,000
and we've seen we can configure these event handlers either in web.xml or using annotations.
