00:00:00,797 --> 00:00:04,344
As a Java programmer, you're probably aware that there are many,

2
00:00:04,344 --> 00:00:06,817
many IDEs that we could use to build applications.

3
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:10,644
There are also toolkits available to allow us to build

4
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,797
applications and to allow us to deploy applications,

5
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:15,727
such as Ant and Maven.

6
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:21,747
For consistency's sake, as part of this project we're going to be using Maven.

7
00:00:21,747 --> 00:00:23,817
Maven is more than a build tool.

8
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:24,555
In fact,

9
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:29,737
people primarily use Maven to manage dependencies within the application.

10
00:00:29,737 --> 00:00:30,358
In this project,

11
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:35,727
we'll use Maven as a standard tool to both build and deploy the application.

12
00:00:35,727 --> 00:00:37,737
Our Maven usage will be fairly simple.

13
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,817
We define a project, the project has a standard groupId,

14
00:00:39,817 --> 00:00:44,767
artifactId, and version, we define some packaging.

15
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:48,777
As we'll see later, we'll be using the Tomcat web server to run the application.

16
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:50,787
And in our Maven POM,

17
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:54,762
I'll define a Tomcat plugin that you can use to

18
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:56,727
deploy the application to Tomcat.

19
00:00:56,727 --> 00:01:01,817
Apart from that, the Maven POM we use will be very, very straightforward.

20
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:05,114
If you've never used Maven before and you're interested in

21
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:06,797
understanding exactly how Maven works,

22
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:10,817
then Pluralsight offers a class that is an introduction to Maven.

23
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:14,807
You can download Maven from maven.apache .org.

24
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:19,787
Simply click on the Download link and grab the latest zip.

25
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:23,787
Once you have it, unzip it, and you need to set a couple of other options.

26
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:24,447
In particular,

27
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:27,304
you need to set MAVEN_HOME so it points at the

28
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:28,997
location you've unzipped the files to,

29
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:35,757
and you'll also need to add MAVEN_HOME\bin to your path.

30
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:40,460
Once you've done that, you'll be able to run Maven from the command line,

31
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:49,000
typing mvn, and you should just see the fact that it runs and so it's available, it knows where home is, and everything should be good to go.
