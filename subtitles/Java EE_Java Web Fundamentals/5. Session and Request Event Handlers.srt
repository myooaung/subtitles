1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,040
So for the session listener, again there are two events.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,980
One is fired after the session starts,

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,394
and then another event used to be fired before the session ended,

4
00:00:11,394 --> 00:00:15,980
however, the Servlet 2.3 specification changed this.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,050
So if you're running your code in a 2.3 container or later,

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,050
this event fires after the session has ended.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,060
There's no session data available now at this point.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:34,040
Again, this is passed an object, and this time it's passed an HttpSessionEvent,

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,060
and this gives us access to the HttpSession.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,980
Let me give you an example.

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,020
So here we have a WhitePagesSessionListener,

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,025
and we can see that this has a sessionCreated and a

13
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:46,670
sessionDestroyed method that correspond to a sessionCreated

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,990
event and a sessionDestroyed event,

15
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,010
and they both passed the HttpSessionEvent object.

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,000
Then there's also a request listener.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,050
So this is fired before the request comes into scope.

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,040
So it's fired before the request enters the filter chain.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,020
We haven't talked about filter chains yet, we'll see those in the next chapter.

20
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,040
Then the sessionDestroyed event is fired after the

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,970
request leaves the filter chain.

22
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,050
So the behavior, we create a request object,

23
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,040
call the requestInitialized event, send the request through the chain,

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,923
which means it's being handled by everything in the chain,

25
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:22,040
including our servlet.

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,040
When the request leaves the chain, we then call the requestDestroyed event.

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,060
Both methods, again, are given access to an event object,

28
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,970
in this case it's the ServletRequestEvent object,

29
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,740
and through here, we get access to the ServletContext and the ServletRequest.

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,020
And again, an example.

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,000
So requestInitialized, requestDestroyed method, they're both passed the ServletRequestEvent object.
