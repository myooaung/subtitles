00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:07,500
Java web applications are typically built out of servlets and JavaServer Pages.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,921
If you're using a framework,

3
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:13,450
that framework will also certainly build on top of these specifications.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,500
For example, Struts.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,460
Struts is a server and JavaServer Page framework.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,490
If something goes wrong inside your application,

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,470
and your application is using a framework such as Struts,

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,520
it's important to understand the underlying APIs.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,460
It's important to understand how a servlet works.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,430
It's important to understand that a JavaServer Page is itself a servlet.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,332
This will aid debugging,

12
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:40,520
it will aid in many other aspects of the application development.

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,339
The servlet specification also defines a couple of other large components,

14
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:48,460
filters and listeners.

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,702
In this class, we'll take a look at what a filter is,

16
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:53,918
we'll take a look at the lifecycle of a filter,

17
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:57,460
we'll also take a look at what a listener is and the lifecycle of a listener,

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,470
and how these two components can be used inside the applications.

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:12,000
Filters in particular are very important as many frameworks today use filters as controllers as part of their MVC model.
