00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:03.431
Now that we have that, we can add a second listener,

2
00:00:03.431 --> 00:00:10.421
but this time we'll use the annotation rather than an entry in the web.xml file.

3
00:00:10.421 --> 00:00:19.341
If we go back into the project and add a new class called AnnotatedAppListener,

4
00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:22.341
and again we'll have this implement ServletContextListener,

5
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:26.351
provide the contextInitialized method, and in here do the same thing.

6
00:00:26.351 --> 00:00:29.421
So from the event, getServletContext, and call its log method,

7
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:32.421
we'll log a slightly different message,

8
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:37.401
but for this we'll add the WebListener annotation.

9
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:44.351
Again, if we deploy and refresh the browser,

10
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:48.361
we now find three entries, two from the listener registered in web.xml,

11
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:51.401
and one from our new listener.

12
00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:59.000
So we see that we can create the listener by registering it in the web.xml file, or by registering it by using the annotation.
