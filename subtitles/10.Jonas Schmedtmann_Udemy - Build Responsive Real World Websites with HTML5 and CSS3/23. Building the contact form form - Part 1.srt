<v Voiceover>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,622  -->  00:00:07,324
Let's build a simple contact form in this lecture.
3

3

00:00:07,324  -->  00:00:09,327
To be honest this section was not
4

4

00:00:09,327  -->  00:00:12,694
so much about making things beautiful and functional,
5

5

00:00:12,694  -->  00:00:14,725
but more to show you everything you need
6

6

00:00:14,725  -->  00:00:17,222
to know about forms so that you can build
7

7

00:00:17,222  -->  00:00:21,314
even bigger and more complex forms in the future.
8

8

00:00:21,314  -->  00:00:23,520
So, this is a simple contact form
9

9

00:00:23,520  -->  00:00:27,687
as you can find it in numerous websites out there.
10

10

00:00:29,093  -->  00:00:33,563
And in this lecture you'll learn a lot of new things.
11

11

00:00:33,563  -->  00:00:35,420
You'll learn how to build a useful form
12

12

00:00:35,420  -->  00:00:37,771
using new HTML elements such as
13

13

00:00:37,771  -->  00:00:41,854
form, label, input, select, option and text area.
14

14

00:00:43,228  -->  00:00:46,130
Then you will learn how to use CSS to format
15

15

00:00:46,130  -->  00:00:48,685
those different elements.
16

16

00:00:48,685  -->  00:00:50,102
So let's do this.
17

17

00:00:50,949  -->  00:00:53,508
So back in our brackets app,
18

18

00:00:53,508  -->  00:00:56,258
we'll create yet another section,
19

19

00:01:00,759  -->  00:01:03,176
this one called section form.
20

20

00:01:06,593  -->  00:01:09,593
And once again, we create a row here
21

21

00:01:11,150  -->  00:01:13,483
where we will put our title.
22

22

00:01:15,591  -->  00:01:18,841
So let's get the text for this section.
23

23

00:01:21,135  -->  00:01:23,385
That's not a lot this time.
24

24

00:01:26,766  -->  00:01:28,933
So the title is, this one.
25

25

00:01:33,064  -->  00:01:35,444
And now let's create our form.
26

26

00:01:35,444  -->  00:01:37,861
And we will do that in a row.
27

27

00:01:38,956  -->  00:01:41,373
So live, class and row again.
28

28

00:01:43,542  -->  00:01:47,375
Now, a form is like a group of input elements,
29

29

00:01:48,389  -->  00:01:50,943
and we have an HTML element
30

30

00:01:50,943  -->  00:01:54,310
where we need to put all of them,
31

31

00:01:54,310  -->  00:01:58,374
and this element is called the form element.
32

32

00:01:58,374  -->  00:02:02,041
And it needs to have a couple of attributes.
33

33

00:02:04,062  -->  00:02:06,297
One is the method.
34

34

00:02:06,297  -->  00:02:08,474
You will choose post here,
35

35

00:02:08,474  -->  00:02:12,509
but this is not relevant for us in this case,
36

36

00:02:12,509  -->  00:02:16,676
because this is only needed when we send this form
37

37

00:02:17,704  -->  00:02:21,871
and that requires a lot of programming in other languages
38

38

00:02:23,103  -->  00:02:26,789
and we will not talk about this in this course.
39

39

00:02:26,789  -->  00:02:29,721
So in this course we will only format this form,
40

40

00:02:29,721  -->  00:02:33,755
but we will not be able to send anything from it.
41

41

00:02:33,755  -->  00:02:37,528
So another attribute that we need to define is the action,
42

42

00:02:37,528  -->  00:02:39,705
which is like a link.
43

43

00:02:39,705  -->  00:02:41,127
So it is empty in this case,
44

44

00:02:41,127  -->  00:02:44,044
and the action could be the script,
45

45

00:02:45,278  -->  00:02:49,051
which handles how the form will be sent.
46

46

00:02:49,051  -->  00:02:51,548
Which, again, we will not talk about
47

47

00:02:51,548  -->  00:02:54,334
in this specific course.
48

48

00:02:54,334  -->  00:02:58,501
And then, also, a class, I will call this contact form.
49

49

00:03:02,780  -->  00:03:06,947
Alright, now we can fill this form with our elements.
50

50

00:03:08,295  -->  00:03:11,712
And we will put a couple of rows in here,
51

51

00:03:12,561  -->  00:03:16,277
and in each of those rows we will then have
52

52

00:03:16,277  -->  00:03:18,694
our different input elements.
53

53

00:03:20,021  -->  00:03:23,438
So we will have one column for the label,
54

54

00:03:24,403  -->  00:03:28,375
for example, name, email address, or something like that,
55

55

00:03:28,375  -->  00:03:31,875
and then one column for the input element.
56

56

00:03:35,202  -->  00:03:39,369
So, it is a column and now it's something a little special
57

57

00:03:42,061  -->  00:03:46,807
because we want one column to be bigger than the other one.
58

58

00:03:46,807  -->  00:03:49,440
So I will say that I want the first column
59

59

00:03:49,440  -->  00:03:52,398
to be a span one of three,
60

60

00:03:52,398  -->  00:03:55,481
such as we used a lot of times before
61

61

00:04:00,103  -->  00:04:04,270
and then the second column will be span two of three.
62

62

00:04:12,163  -->  00:04:16,246
So these two columns together make the whole row,
63

63

00:04:18,795  -->  00:04:21,128
so one plus two makes three.
64

64

00:04:22,241  -->  00:04:27,019
And this means that this column will be twice as wide
65

65

00:04:27,019  -->  00:04:28,970
as this column here.
66

66

00:04:28,970  -->  00:04:32,637
And I will actually show you how this works.
67

67

00:04:34,008  -->  00:04:38,175
So the one of three has a width of 32%, approximately,
68

68

00:04:40,412  -->  00:04:44,579
and span two of three will have 63% approximately.
69

69

00:04:48,735  -->  00:04:52,902
Alright, so as I said in the first column we want the label
70

70

00:04:54,098  -->  00:04:57,181
and we have an HTML element for that,
71

71

00:04:59,202  -->  00:05:03,753
which goes like this, it's just labeled and then,
72

72

00:05:03,753  -->  00:05:05,996
let me see, it is name.
73

73

00:05:05,996  -->  00:05:10,515
The first one is name, and that's it for now.
74

74

00:05:10,515  -->  00:05:13,348
And now we want a little text box,
75

75

00:05:14,286  -->  00:05:18,369
and in order to do that, we use the input element
76

76

00:05:19,552  -->  00:05:22,803
and the type of this will be text.
77

77

00:05:22,803  -->  00:05:25,761
So you can see in this list here there are lots
78

78

00:05:25,761  -->  00:05:29,391
of different input types and we will use some of them,
79

79

00:05:29,391  -->  00:05:33,224
but for now, I will just use the text element.
80

80

00:05:36,814  -->  00:05:40,981
Now, in each of those, we should also give those a name
81

81

00:05:43,185  -->  00:05:47,801
because that name will later be used to send that form.
82

82

00:05:47,801  -->  00:05:51,968
Let's call it name, because that's what it is here, right?
83

83

00:05:53,490  -->  00:05:56,676
And now I will also define an ID here,
84

84

00:05:56,676  -->  00:05:59,017
which is also name.
85

85

00:05:59,017  -->  00:06:02,560
And another interesting thing we can do here is placeholder,
86

86

00:06:02,560  -->  00:06:05,844
and the placeholder is the text that appears
87

87

00:06:05,844  -->  00:06:08,672
inside of the text field
88

88

00:06:08,672  -->  00:06:11,662
before we write anything inside of it.
89

89

00:06:11,662  -->  00:06:15,245
So here I will say, for example, your name.
90

90

00:06:18,619  -->  00:06:22,394
And the last thing here, we can just add this keyword,
91

91

00:06:22,394  -->  00:06:26,561
required, and if we do so, the browser will not allow us
92

92

00:06:27,433  -->  00:06:30,976
to send a form without completing this field.
93

93

00:06:30,976  -->  00:06:32,699
So this is very handy.
94

94

00:06:32,699  -->  00:06:36,405
You can just write required and then Google Chrome,
95

95

00:06:36,405  -->  00:06:40,155
or whatever browser, will handle that for us.
96

96

00:06:41,183  -->  00:06:46,157
Okay, I will just show you how this looks like by now.
97

97

00:06:46,157  -->  00:06:50,578
Nothing special, of course, but here it goes.
98

98

00:06:50,578  -->  00:06:54,967
So this is a placeholder and this the first column,
99

99

00:06:54,967  -->  00:06:56,202
and this is the second column.
100

100

00:06:56,202  -->  00:06:58,218
And as you can see, it's much wider.
101

101

00:06:58,218  -->  00:07:02,411
The text field is not as wide as the column yet
102

102

00:07:02,411  -->  00:07:04,589
but we will change that once we come
103

103

00:07:04,589  -->  00:07:07,256
to the CSS part of this lecture.
104

104

00:07:08,425  -->  00:07:10,896
So for now, let's continue
105

105

00:07:10,896  -->  00:07:13,529
and I will keep on adding some rows here.
106

106

00:07:13,529  -->  00:07:16,279
So the next one is for the email.
107

107

00:07:17,709  -->  00:07:20,431
So I will change it here,
108

108

00:07:20,431  -->  00:07:24,348
and you can actually also change the type here,
109

109

00:07:26,084  -->  00:07:29,667
to email because that's one of the possible
110

110

00:07:30,605  -->  00:07:32,022
HTML input types.
111

111

00:07:33,402  -->  00:07:35,854
And so the browser will recognize
112

112

00:07:35,854  -->  00:07:40,021
that you need to write an email inside of the field.
113

113

00:07:42,367  -->  00:07:46,367
Well I will call this email and here your email,
114

114

00:07:49,110  -->  00:07:53,133
and this field's also required and can only be sent
115

115

00:07:53,133  -->  00:07:57,300
if a valid email address was written inside of that field.
116

116

00:08:00,681  -->  00:08:04,848
Okay, so yet another line is, what do we have here?
117

117

00:08:09,110  -->  00:08:11,370
How did you find us?
118

118

00:08:11,370  -->  00:08:14,620
Maybe we can put a little dropdown box?
119

119

00:08:19,646  -->  00:08:21,753
We will not use this,
120

120

00:08:21,753  -->  00:08:25,336
so dropdown box is just a couple of options
121

121

00:08:27,806  -->  00:08:30,450
where you can choose one from.
122

122

00:08:30,450  -->  00:08:34,617
And in order to do that, we use the select element
123

123

00:08:37,155  -->  00:08:39,405
and we'll call this find us
124

124

00:08:42,059  -->  00:08:44,392
and also add the ID find us.
125

125

00:08:45,622  -->  00:08:49,789
And I will tell you in a moment why we need these IDs here.
126

126

00:08:52,518  -->  00:08:53,768
So don't worry.
127

127

00:08:54,778  -->  00:08:57,537
And now, each of the options that we want here
128

128

00:08:57,537  -->  00:09:01,287
needs to be defined using the action element.
129

129

00:09:06,694  -->  00:09:10,861
And we need to specify a value, I will do that in a moment,
130

130

00:09:13,475  -->  00:09:16,885
and then the text we want to see.
131

131

00:09:16,885  -->  00:09:21,559
So in the first one I want to say, so how did you find us?
132

132

00:09:21,559  -->  00:09:25,726
Let's say, friends, and the value here can be friends.
133

133

00:09:29,413  -->  00:09:33,913
And again, this value here source then for the script
134

134

00:09:33,913  -->  00:09:37,913
that will handle the form once the form is sent,
135

135

00:09:39,430  -->  00:09:43,597
which again we will not be able to do in this course.
136

136

00:09:46,212  -->  00:09:48,712
So next, what can we put here?
137

137

00:09:50,656  -->  00:09:53,323
Um, for instance, search engine.
138

138

00:09:57,744  -->  00:09:58,661
So, search,
139

139

00:10:02,188  -->  00:10:05,271
or maybe it was an ad, advertisement.
140

140

00:10:15,713  -->  00:10:19,796
And just to complete this, we can say we found it
141

141

00:10:21,613  -->  00:10:23,113
in some other way.
142

142

00:10:24,371  -->  00:10:27,288
Alright, so, how does it look like?
143

143

00:10:29,467  -->  00:10:31,842
So we have the options we put there
144

144

00:10:31,842  -->  00:10:34,092
inside of this little list.
145

145

00:10:36,517  -->  00:10:40,118
So this is starting to look great, right?
146

146

00:10:40,118  -->  00:10:43,221
And we can also do another thing here.
147

147

00:10:43,221  -->  00:10:46,971
We can choose one of these and say, selected,
148

148

00:10:48,317  -->  00:10:50,616
which is this one, this will be the first one
149

149

00:10:50,616  -->  00:10:53,029
that will be selected, see?
150

150

00:10:53,029  -->  00:10:54,196
Search engine.
151

151

00:10:57,129  -->  00:11:01,296
Alright, I don't want this here, let's put it here.
152

152

00:11:04,302  -->  00:11:08,469
Now the next thing is to ask us if we want a newsletter.
153

153

00:11:10,883  -->  00:11:14,800
So again we want a row with a label newsletter.
154

154

00:11:21,841  -->  00:11:24,676
And now I will issue another input type
155

155

00:11:24,676  -->  00:11:26,759
and this one is checkbox.
156

156

00:11:28,201  -->  00:11:31,342
So checkbox is just what the name says,
157

157

00:11:31,342  -->  00:11:33,258
it's a box where you can choose
158

158

00:11:33,258  -->  00:11:36,974
yes I want it or no I don't want it,
159

159

00:11:36,974  -->  00:11:41,057
and the name here will be newsletter or just news
160

160

00:11:42,415  -->  00:11:44,165
and the ID also news.
161

161

00:11:45,518  -->  00:11:48,768
Placeholder, yes of course, none of it.
162

162

00:11:51,418  -->  00:11:54,905
And here I can say that I want this checkbox
163

163

00:11:54,905  -->  00:11:57,655
to be checked from the beginning,
164

164

00:11:59,196  -->  00:12:02,261
so the default will be that it is checked.
165

165

00:12:02,261  -->  00:12:06,428
And then some text here, for instance, yes please.
166

166

00:12:09,349  -->  00:12:10,843
So it's already selected there
167

167

00:12:10,843  -->  00:12:13,525
and then we have our text there.
168

168

00:12:13,525  -->  00:12:15,692
So just a simple checkbox.
169

169

00:12:16,552  -->  00:12:20,345
Now the last thing is wrap as align,
170

170

00:12:20,345  -->  00:12:23,012
so that means that it is a field
171

171

00:12:24,099  -->  00:12:27,766
where we can write some email, some message.
172

172

00:12:30,633  -->  00:12:34,800
And in order to do that we want a bigger text box.
173

173

00:12:38,122  -->  00:12:39,372
Copy this here.
174

174

00:12:43,869  -->  00:12:46,359
So we will use something different
175

175

00:12:46,359  -->  00:12:50,535
'cause we want a big text area and that's exactly
176

176

00:12:50,535  -->  00:12:52,952
the name of the HTML element.
177

177

00:12:55,363  -->  00:12:58,236
And this also needs some attributes,
178

178

00:12:58,236  -->  00:13:01,069
so I will call this name, message.
179

179

00:13:04,481  -->  00:13:08,648
And it can also have a placeholder like your message.
180

180

00:13:09,845  -->  00:13:12,795
Okay, and then the last thing
181

181

00:13:12,795  -->  00:13:16,962
each form should of course have is a submit button.
182

182

00:13:24,595  -->  00:13:29,461
So we don't want anything in here because we want the button
183

183

00:13:29,461  -->  00:13:33,063
to be aligned with the fields of this form,
184

184

00:13:33,063  -->  00:13:35,515
and such as I did in the section before,
185

185

00:13:35,515  -->  00:13:38,598
I will use the NBSP special character
186

186

00:13:39,959  -->  00:13:43,376
so that we have an invisible space there.
187

187

00:13:46,012  -->  00:13:49,262
And the button is also an inbox element
188

188

00:13:50,418  -->  00:13:54,585
and it's called submit, and doesn't need any of this.
189

189

00:13:59,000  -->  00:14:01,500
But it has the value attribute
190

190

00:14:04,671  -->  00:14:08,157
where we will put the text we want to see on the button,
191

191

00:14:08,157  -->  00:14:11,074
and in this place just say send it.
192

192

00:14:12,372  -->  00:14:13,955
We don't need this.
193

193

00:14:18,080  -->  00:14:20,330
So save this and let's see.
194

194

00:14:21,605  -->  00:14:23,444
So this is a bigger text field
195

195

00:14:23,444  -->  00:14:27,527
and we can actually resize this in Google Chrome.
196

196

00:14:29,421  -->  00:14:32,984
And then the button, and as you see this field,
197

197

00:14:32,984  -->  00:14:36,700
since I didn't fill it out, Google Chrome tells me,
198

198

00:14:36,700  -->  00:14:38,654
Please fill out this field.
199

199

00:14:38,654  -->  00:14:42,237
And if I do, it will not say fill this out.
200

200

00:14:44,631  -->  00:14:48,156
And I'll, since I said this would be an email field,
201

201

00:14:48,156  -->  00:14:52,151
Google Chrome knows that I should include
202

202

00:14:52,151  -->  00:14:55,901
the special symbol here in the email address.
203

203

00:14:56,853  -->  00:15:00,953
So one last thing is, as I promised you I would explain
204

204

00:15:00,953  -->  00:15:04,401
to you why I included these name IDs here
205

205

00:15:04,401  -->  00:15:07,312
and that's for a simple reason,
206

206

00:15:07,312  -->  00:15:11,479
because here in the label we can use the for attribute
207

207

00:15:13,213  -->  00:15:16,213
and then put the name of the ID here
208

208

00:15:18,040  -->  00:15:21,411
so we kind of link the label with the input
209

209

00:15:21,411  -->  00:15:23,494
and this is what happens.
210

210

00:15:24,362  -->  00:15:28,529
So now, we can click this and then the field gets selected.
211

211

00:15:32,522  -->  00:15:33,522
Cool, right?
212

212

00:15:34,476  -->  00:15:37,695
Do this for the other ones as well.
213

213

00:15:37,695  -->  00:15:38,612
For, email.
214

214

00:15:41,832  -->  00:15:45,499
And this actually only works with text forms
215

215

00:15:48,192  -->  00:15:51,025
and also with this select element.
216

216

00:15:54,054  -->  00:15:58,422
So this one is find us, but it doesn't work
217

217

00:15:58,422  -->  00:16:02,339
with a checkbox and neither with the text area,
218

218

00:16:04,360  -->  00:16:07,502
so I will just leave it like this.
219

219

00:16:07,502  -->  00:16:11,169
And now if I click here, this gets selected.
220

220

00:16:12,943  -->  00:16:16,443
Okay, I think for the HTML part, that's it
221

221

00:16:17,693  -->  00:16:20,988
and so in the next lecture, we will just format this
222

222

00:16:20,988  -->  00:16:25,126
to make it look great, such as we always do.
223

223

00:16:25,126  -->  00:16:27,376
Alright, so, see you there!
