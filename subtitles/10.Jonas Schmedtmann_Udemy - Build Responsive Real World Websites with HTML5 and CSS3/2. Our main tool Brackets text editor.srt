00:00:01,817  -->  00:00:03,607
<v Voiceover>Hello, and welcome back</v>
2

2

00:00:03,607  -->  00:00:06,254
to the HTML basic section.
3

3

00:00:06,254  -->  00:00:07,508
In this section,
4

4

00:00:07,508  -->  00:00:11,362
we will finally start coding some HTML,
5

5

00:00:11,362  -->  00:00:13,916
but before we get to the actual coding
6

6

00:00:13,916  -->  00:00:16,633
we need to first pick a text editor
7

7

00:00:16,633  -->  00:00:18,769
This is the program that we will use
8

8

00:00:18,769  -->  00:00:21,416
to write all our code.
9

9

00:00:21,416  -->  00:00:24,249
A modern text editor should have features
10

10

00:00:24,249  -->  00:00:27,779
such as syntax, highlighting, and code completion
11

11

00:00:27,779  -->  00:00:29,612
for quick development.
12

12

00:00:31,656  -->  00:00:34,048
In this course I will use a text editor
13

13

00:00:34,048  -->  00:00:35,868
called Brackets.
14

14

00:00:35,868  -->  00:00:38,307
It is perfect for web development,
15

15

00:00:38,307  -->  00:00:40,605
and offers some features I really love
16

16

00:00:40,605  -->  00:00:42,486
and are really useful.
17

17

00:00:42,486  -->  00:00:44,530
I would even say that this is the best
18

18

00:00:44,530  -->  00:00:48,088
text editor for web development out there.
19

19

00:00:48,088  -->  00:00:52,643
It's available for Mac OS X and also for Windows.
20

20

00:00:52,643  -->  00:00:55,290
And the best thing, it is completely free.
21

21

00:00:55,290  -->  00:00:57,207
So let's go down on it.
22

22

00:01:00,212  -->  00:01:02,513
So here in Google it is quite easy
23

23

00:01:02,513  -->  00:01:05,346
to find it, just type brackets.io.
24

24

00:01:11,098  -->  00:01:13,722
Okay then download and install it.
25

25

00:01:13,722  -->  00:01:15,115
Right here.
26

26

00:01:15,115  -->  00:01:16,531
I don't have to do this because
27

27

00:01:16,531  -->  00:01:19,573
I already have it installed here on my Mac.
28

28

00:01:19,573  -->  00:01:23,056
I strongly suggest you to use this editor,
29

29

00:01:23,056  -->  00:01:25,100
but if you are already familiar with some
30

30

00:01:25,100  -->  00:01:28,002
other text editor you can of course use that
31

31

00:01:28,002  -->  00:01:29,335
for this course.
32

32

00:01:31,053  -->  00:01:35,070
So I hope you managed to install Brackets by now.
33

33

00:01:35,070  -->  00:01:38,237
So now let's go open our Brackets app.
34

34

00:01:40,086  -->  00:01:42,826
When you do that for the first time,
35

35

00:01:42,826  -->  00:01:46,425
you'll see this simple demo HTML file
36

36

00:01:46,425  -->  00:01:49,092
explaining how the editor works.
37

37

00:01:49,937  -->  00:01:51,891
We don't need that for now
38

38

00:01:51,891  -->  00:01:53,191
because I will show you everything
39

39

00:01:53,191  -->  00:01:56,581
you need to know over the next sections.
40

40

00:01:56,581  -->  00:01:59,159
For now I just want to briefly go over
41

41

00:01:59,159  -->  00:02:02,270
the most important parts of the interface.
42

42

00:02:02,270  -->  00:02:05,312
It's very simple, yet very powerful.
43

43

00:02:05,312  -->  00:02:08,098
So as you can see right here,
44

44

00:02:08,098  -->  00:02:10,560
here in the middle, goes all the codes
45

45

00:02:10,560  -->  00:02:14,252
we're gonna write over this course.
46

46

00:02:14,252  -->  00:02:17,201
On the left side, we have the files
47

47

00:02:17,201  -->  00:02:20,312
that are currently opened, named here
48

48

00:02:20,312  -->  00:02:21,729
the working files
49

49

00:02:22,820  -->  00:02:25,555
and there's also a file train that shows
50

50

00:02:25,555  -->  00:02:28,305
all files contained in a project.
51

51

00:02:29,363  -->  00:02:32,591
In this demo project it's only in HTML
52

52

00:02:32,591  -->  00:02:35,517
and a CSS file and a folder.
53

53

00:02:35,517  -->  00:02:37,513
Yeah, screenshots.
54

54

00:02:37,513  -->  00:02:40,834
And then we have the right side
55

55

00:02:40,834  -->  00:02:43,435
and there is a plug-in bar.
56

56

00:02:43,435  -->  00:02:46,871
There are tons of cool plug-ins for Brackets
57

57

00:02:46,871  -->  00:02:49,983
which are like apps that extend the functionality
58

58

00:02:49,983  -->  00:02:52,769
of the editor and we will actually use
59

59

00:02:52,769  -->  00:02:56,275
some of them later in the course.
60

60

00:02:56,275  -->  00:02:59,025
So very simple, but very powerful
61

61

00:03:00,223  -->  00:03:02,916
and the most important thing here in the middle
62

62

00:03:02,916  -->  00:03:05,470
where we will write our code.
63

63

00:03:05,470  -->  00:03:07,839
So that was a very small introduction
64

64

00:03:07,839  -->  00:03:08,839
to Brackets.
65

65

00:03:09,720  -->  00:03:11,786
Now let's get started with some HTML
66

66

00:03:11,786  -->  00:03:14,786
in the next lecture, see you there.
