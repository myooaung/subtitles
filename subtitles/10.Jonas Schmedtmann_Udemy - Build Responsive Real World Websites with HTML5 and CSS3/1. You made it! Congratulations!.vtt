00:00:01.471  -->  00:00:03.233
<v Voiceover>Congratulations.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.233  -->  00:00:05.483
You deserve it because you made it all the way
3

3

00:00:05.483  -->  00:00:07.488
until the end of this course.
4

4

00:00:07.488  -->  00:00:09.155
That's just amazing.
5

5

00:00:10.438  -->  00:00:12.117
I am really proud of you,
6

6

00:00:12.117  -->  00:00:13.755
and I want to thank you so much
7

7

00:00:13.755  -->  00:00:16.540
for staying with me through all this course.
8

8

00:00:16.540  -->  00:00:19.489
I really, really hope that you have learned a lot
9

9

00:00:19.489  -->  00:00:22.025
from all of the lectures.
10

10

00:00:22.025  -->  00:00:23.665
What I showed you in this course will
11

11

00:00:23.665  -->  00:00:25.631
give you a strong foundation,
12

12

00:00:25.631  -->  00:00:28.047
and you are now able to build beautiful websites
13

13

00:00:28.047  -->  00:00:29.964
completely on your own.
14

14

00:00:31.158  -->  00:00:32.838
Now, let me tell you this.
15

15

00:00:32.838  -->  00:00:35.175
This may be the end of this course,
16

16

00:00:35.175  -->  00:00:38.125
but it certainly isn't the end of your journey.
17

17

00:00:38.125  -->  00:00:40.542
In fact, it is just the beginning.
18

18

00:00:40.542  -->  00:00:44.459
There is still so much more fun stuff to learn.
19

19

00:00:45.293  -->  00:00:48.937
Actually, I will be adding bonus lectures in the future
20

20

00:00:48.937  -->  00:00:51.434
about topics that you, my students,
21

21

00:00:51.434  -->  00:00:53.977
wish to learn more about.
22

22

00:00:53.977  -->  00:00:55.739
So, if enough students want to learn
23

23

00:00:55.739  -->  00:00:59.099
about a specific topic, I will be very happy
24

24

00:00:59.099  -->  00:01:01.596
to add a bonus video about it.
25

25

00:01:01.596  -->  00:01:04.056
So, let me know about that in the comment section
26

26

00:01:04.056  -->  00:01:05.723
right of this video.
27

27

00:01:07.826  -->  00:01:10.489
Now, once you're a web designer and developer,
28

28

00:01:10.489  -->  00:01:12.617
one thing you will want to do is
29

29

00:01:12.617  -->  00:01:15.199
to keep up with the web industry.
30

30

00:01:15.199  -->  00:01:17.206
Things are in constant change,
31

31

00:01:17.206  -->  00:01:20.197
and there are always new things to learn.
32

32

00:01:20.197  -->  00:01:23.267
For instance, five years ago, no one even knew
33

33

00:01:23.267  -->  00:01:25.520
responsive web design existed.
34

34

00:01:25.520  -->  00:01:30.189
And today, you simply cannot build a non-responsive website.
35

35

00:01:30.189  -->  00:01:33.017
So, the best thing you can do to keep up
36

36

00:01:33.017  -->  00:01:35.024
with all the new best practices,
37

37

00:01:35.024  -->  00:01:38.712
new tools and new resources is to read web design
38

38

00:01:38.712  -->  00:01:40.966
and development blogs.
39

39

00:01:40.966  -->  00:01:43.179
There are plenty of them on the internet,
40

40

00:01:43.179  -->  00:01:45.433
and I put some of the ones I follow
41

41

00:01:45.433  -->  00:01:47.183
in the course e-book.
42

42

00:01:49.079  -->  00:01:51.944
Now, maybe you wonder what else you can do now
43

43

00:01:51.944  -->  00:01:53.707
to practice your new skills,
44

44

00:01:53.707  -->  00:01:56.207
and even start to earn some money.
45

45

00:01:56.207  -->  00:02:00.221
Well, there are actually a lot of things you can do.
46

46

00:02:00.221  -->  00:02:03.460
For instance, redesign existing websites
47

47

00:02:03.460  -->  00:02:06.041
that you think are poorly designed.
48

48

00:02:06.041  -->  00:02:08.089
If you know the owner of the website,
49

49

00:02:08.089  -->  00:02:09.890
you can even show your redesign
50

50

00:02:09.890  -->  00:02:12.923
and offer them your services.
51

51

00:02:12.923  -->  00:02:15.179
You can also design a website for free
52

52

00:02:15.179  -->  00:02:18.580
for a local charity or something like that.
53

53

00:02:18.580  -->  00:02:22.267
Or, go to 99 Designs and join design contests.
54

54

00:02:22.267  -->  00:02:24.531
You will make designs for different contests,
55

55

00:02:24.531  -->  00:02:28.494
and if you win, you get the prize money.
56

56

00:02:28.494  -->  00:02:30.543
And once you're more confident,
57

57

00:02:30.543  -->  00:02:32.795
you can start to do some freelance work
58

58

00:02:32.795  -->  00:02:36.153
on freelancing websites such as freelancer.com,
59

59

00:02:36.153  -->  00:02:37.570
oDesk, or Elance.
60

60

00:02:38.485  -->  00:02:41.394
You can find lots of stuff about these websites
61

61

00:02:41.394  -->  00:02:44.477
in case you want to start doing this.
62

62

00:02:46.307  -->  00:02:48.518
I would also love it if you'd stay here
63

63

00:02:48.518  -->  00:02:52.575
in the course forums helping out others whenever you can,
64

64

00:02:52.575  -->  00:02:54.994
and remain a valuable part of this community
65

65

00:02:54.994  -->  00:02:57.867
we're building together here.
66

66

00:02:57.867  -->  00:03:00.120
Even now that you've completed the course,
67

67

00:03:00.120  -->  00:03:04.038
feel free to ask me any question you might have.
68

68

00:03:04.038  -->  00:03:06.995
Now, let me give you one last piece of advice.
69

69

00:03:06.995  -->  00:03:11.542
Practice, practice, practice your new skills.
70

70

00:03:11.542  -->  00:03:14.190
Please never stop learning
71

71

00:03:14.190  -->  00:03:16.977
and you will achieve more than you can imagine.
72

72

00:03:16.977  -->  00:03:17.810
Dream big.
73

73

00:03:18.738  -->  00:03:21.608
I wish you all the best for your new career,
74

74

00:03:21.608  -->  00:03:24.393
and I genuinely hope that all those dreams
75

75

00:03:24.393  -->  00:03:25.560
may come true.
