57

00:03:29.689  -->  00:03:32.168
This is where the fun begins.
58

58

00:03:32.168  -->  00:03:35.256
Over the sections five and six, you'll put in action

65

65

00:03:56.263  -->  00:03:59.270

69

00:04:11.522  -->  00:04:14.529
All of this feels a bit overwhelming, right?
70

70

00:04:14.529  -->  00:04:17.068

I am Jonas, and I am your instructor.
72

72

00:04:20.461  -->  00:04:22.818
Believe me, coding doesn’t have to be
73

73

00:04:22.818  -->  00:04:25.788
hard, or scary, or boring.
74

74

00:04:25.788  -->  00:04:28.084
I'm here to guide you step by step
75

75

00:04:28.084  -->  00:04:30.888

79

00:04:40.327  -->  00:04:42.776
I started to learn web design and development
80

80

00:04:42.776  -->  00:04:44.950
about eight years ago.
81

81

00:04:44.950  -->  00:04:49.278
There was no such thing as you doing courses back then.
82

82

00:04:49.278  -->  00:04:51.179
I went through the pain of going through,
83

83

00:04:51.179  -->  00:04:54.137
I don't know how many books, and literally
84

84

00:04:54.137  -->  00:04:57.977
thousands of online articles and tutorials.
85

85

00:04:57.977  -->  00:05:01.687
I wanna spare you all that pain, so I picked everything
86

86

00:05:01.687  -->  00:05:05.547

89

00:05:11.016  -->  00:05:15.183
