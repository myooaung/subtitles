00:00:01,884  -->  00:00:04,671 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Welcome to the next lecture.</v>
2

2

00:00:04,671  -->  00:00:07,689 line:15% 
After building the header in the last lecture,
3

3

00:00:07,689  -->  00:00:11,272 line:15% 
let's build the features section right now.
4

4

00:00:12,403  -->  00:00:14,447
So this is the nice, clean features section
5

5

00:00:14,447  -->  00:00:17,030
we'll build based on my sketch.
6

6

00:00:17,952  -->  00:00:22,109
Just a nice heading, some text, and then features
7

7

00:00:22,109  -->  00:00:24,362
explained in four columns.
8

8

00:00:24,362  -->  00:00:27,195
This should not be so hard, right?
9

9

00:00:28,703  -->  00:00:32,257
So in this lecture, we'll learn some new things.
10

10

00:00:32,257  -->  00:00:35,367
We'll learn how to put content on a website directly
11

11

00:00:35,367  -->  00:00:38,450
from CSS with the after pseudo-class.
12

12

00:00:40,082  -->  00:00:42,682
We'll use the fluid grid for the first time
13

13

00:00:42,682  -->  00:00:46,265
in order to build the four features column.
14

14

00:00:47,140  -->  00:00:51,307
And we'll also use beautiful icons in those columns as well.
15

15

00:00:52,272  -->  00:00:53,355
So, let's go.
16

16

00:00:55,477  -->  00:00:59,772
So this is where we left our project after the last lecture.
17

17

00:00:59,772  -->  00:01:02,419
The header is all built, now it's time
18

18

00:01:02,419  -->  00:01:05,392
to start adding the first section.
19

19

00:01:05,392  -->  00:01:09,268
And in HTML, we actually have an element for that,
20

20

00:01:09,268  -->  00:01:11,268
which is called Section.
21

21

00:01:12,822  -->  00:01:15,701
In this is just like the header, it's a container
22

22

00:01:15,701  -->  00:01:18,868
so that we can tell this is a section.
23

23

00:01:22,993  -->  00:01:26,076
So I will call this section Features.
24

24

00:01:29,911  -->  00:01:34,078 line:15% 
And now, let's start with the title, and with the paragraph.
25

25

00:01:35,530  -->  00:01:37,530 line:15% 
We'll put that in a row.
26

26

00:01:39,269  -->  00:01:43,436 line:15% 
So, class, row, because of course, we want this centered.
27

27

00:01:46,537  -->  00:01:49,989 line:15% 
And now, let's put a heading here.
28

28

00:01:49,989  -->  00:01:54,882 line:15% 
Now each web page should only have one H1 element,
29

29

00:01:54,882  -->  00:01:56,808 line:15% 
which means only one main heading.
30

30

00:01:56,808  -->  00:01:59,131 line:15% 
We already used that main heading here,
31

31

00:01:59,131  -->  00:02:03,298 line:15% 
so for now in each of the sections, we will put an H2 title.
32

32

00:02:06,677  -->  00:02:10,677 line:15% 
Let's see what content we have for this section,
33

33

00:02:12,389  -->  00:02:13,639
and here it is.
34

34

00:02:14,571  -->  00:02:18,738
I will copy all of it, actually, and put it down here
35

35

00:02:22,374  -->  00:02:24,707 line:15% 
such as I did the last time.
36

36

00:02:26,229  -->  00:02:30,245
Now, I already showed you how to make comments in CSS,
37

37

00:02:30,245  -->  00:02:33,543
now I will tell you the same thing for HTML,
38

38

00:02:33,543  -->  00:02:35,958
and it's very easy.
39

39

00:02:35,958  -->  00:02:40,125
Just like this: you see everything turned grey here?
40

40

00:02:41,800  -->  00:02:44,665
Now to close it, it's just like this.
41

41

00:02:44,665  -->  00:02:48,832
And now it is a comment, and it will not appear anywhere.
42

42

00:02:50,201  -->  00:02:54,232
I can just leave it here until we use all of this text.
43

43

00:02:54,232  -->  00:02:56,732
So the title here is this one.
44

44

00:02:59,503  -->  00:03:02,253 line:15% 
It is-- where-- right here, okay.
45

45

00:03:04,356  -->  00:03:06,939 line:15% 
"Get Food Fast, Not Fast Food."
46

46

00:03:07,885  -->  00:03:11,802 line:15% 
Instead of this, I actually want an larger dash
47

47

00:03:14,201  -->  00:03:19,031 line:15% 
that's called an M dash, and in HTML, we have a thing
48

48

00:03:19,031  -->  00:03:23,198 line:15% 
called HTML special characters, or special entities,
49

49

00:03:25,114  -->  00:03:28,947 line:15% 
and to write those we start with an ampersand,
50

50

00:03:30,873  -->  00:03:34,542 line:15% 
and in this case, I already know how it's called,
51

51

00:03:34,542  -->  00:03:35,542 line:15% 
it's M dash.
52

52

00:03:39,069  -->  00:03:43,236 line:15% 
So instead of writing that dash, I write this HTML code.
53

53

00:03:44,627  -->  00:03:48,794 line:15% 
And you can find lots of tables on the internet about this,
54

54

00:03:50,447  -->  00:03:54,650 line:15% 
and I will also include a link in the course e-book
55

55

00:03:54,650  -->  00:03:58,319 line:15% 
where you can find lots of HTML entities.
56

56

00:03:58,319  -->  00:04:00,432 line:15% 
Alright, this is for the heading,
57

57

00:04:00,432  -->  00:04:04,599 line:15% 
and now let's add the text as well in form of a paragraph.
58

58

00:04:08,559  -->  00:04:12,158 line:15% 
And of course we need a class name here,
59

59

00:04:12,158  -->  00:04:16,325 line:15% 
and I will call this Long Copy because it's a long paragraph
60

60

00:04:18,032  -->  00:04:22,770 line:15% 
with lots of text, and copy stands for copyright,
61

61

00:04:22,770  -->  00:04:25,770 line:15% 
which is like the text for websites.
62

62

00:04:29,921  -->  00:04:34,496 line:15% 
So in this paragraph, we'll put this text here.
63

63

00:04:34,496  -->  00:04:38,663 line:15% 
We'll actually delete all the text we already used.
64

64

00:04:40,138  -->  00:04:42,471 line:15% 
So put this text right here.
65

65

00:04:47,197  -->  00:04:51,364 line:15% 
As we did with the header, I will start by building the HTML
66

66

00:04:52,468  -->  00:04:56,635 line:15% 
and the CSS will be then used to format all of this.
67

67

00:05:01,523  -->  00:05:05,356 line:15% 
And now let's start using the grid like a pro.
68

68

00:05:06,469  -->  00:05:10,636 line:15% 
And in order to do that, we have to start a new row.
69

69

00:05:12,368  -->  00:05:16,035 line:15% 
Just close this, and now inside of this row,
70

70

00:05:18,091  -->  00:05:20,591 line:15% 
we make a dif for each column.
71

71

00:05:21,774  -->  00:05:23,191 line:15% 
Dif. Class again.
72

72

00:05:25,932  -->  00:05:30,181 line:15% 
Now each column needs to call class, and this comes here
73

73

00:05:30,181  -->  00:05:34,639 line:15% 
from the grid CSS file, so we don't have to worry about it,
74

74

00:05:34,639  -->  00:05:36,972 line:15% 
we just use this call class.
75

75

00:05:40,514  -->  00:05:44,681 line:15% 
So each class-- sorry, so each column needs a call class.
76

76

00:05:46,922  -->  00:05:51,089
Now we have four columns so each of those four columns
77

77

00:05:53,926  -->  00:05:57,176
will have this class, span one of four.
78

78

00:06:01,504  -->  00:06:05,336
And again, we can check this here in the grid file
79

79

00:06:05,336  -->  00:06:08,284
with a three, and grid of four.
80

80

00:06:08,284  -->  00:06:10,514
So each of our four columns will have
81

81

00:06:10,514  -->  00:06:12,514
a width of 23.8 percent.
82

82

00:06:18,014  -->  00:06:22,181 line:15% 
Alright, back here, so let's put some more text here.
83

83

00:06:23,303  -->  00:06:27,136 line:15% 
I think that these things here are like titles
84

84

00:06:28,532  -->  00:06:32,527 line:15% 
of each of the features, so let's make
85

85

00:06:32,527  -->  00:06:35,754 line:15% 
another heading element with these.
86

86

00:06:35,754  -->  00:06:39,837 line:15% 
We already used H1, H2, and now it's time for H3.
87

87

00:06:43,602  -->  00:06:46,685 line:15% 
Alright, and now the text below this,
88

88

00:06:48,734  -->  00:06:50,817 line:15% 
and again in a paragraph.
89

89

00:06:52,890  -->  00:06:55,700 line:15% 
I'm not going to worry about icons for now,
90

90

00:06:55,700  -->  00:06:59,438
the icons will also go inside of this column.
91

91

00:06:59,438  -->  00:07:03,223
But I will just leave this for the end,
92

92

00:07:03,223  -->  00:07:06,806
because we so far have not talked about it.
93

93

00:07:10,421  -->  00:07:13,754
So now I will just copy this three times
94

94

00:07:20,568  -->  00:07:23,318
and then fill this with our text.
95

95

00:07:31,749  -->  00:07:34,166
It's kind of boring, I guess.
96

96

00:07:41,838  -->  00:07:46,714 line:15% 
Now you will see that part of your work will always be
97

97

00:07:46,714  -->  00:07:50,881 line:15% 
copy and paste, and you will probably get used to it.
98

98

00:07:55,747  -->  00:07:58,247 line:15% 
And the last thing right here.
99

99

00:08:06,568  -->  00:08:08,077 line:15% 
Okay, that's it with text.
100

100

00:08:08,077  -->  00:08:11,577 line:15% 
So we already used all the text from here.
101

101

00:08:13,928  -->  00:08:16,389
I will save this, and now let's see
102

102

00:08:16,389  -->  00:08:19,139
how it looks like in the browser.
103

103

00:08:20,360  -->  00:08:24,027 line:15% 
It's down here, alright, not so cool, right?
104

104

00:08:25,097  -->  00:08:28,046 line:15% 
What's missing here? Our icons.
105

105

00:08:28,046  -->  00:08:32,550 line:15% 
So let's fix that, and we will use a beautiful
106

106

00:08:32,550  -->  00:08:35,800 line:15% 
icon font called ion icons, here it is.
107

107

00:08:38,518  -->  00:08:39,888
So ion icons.
108

108

00:08:39,888  -->  00:08:44,055
Don't worry, this link is once again in the course e-book.
109

109

00:08:46,529  -->  00:08:50,696
And we will start by downloading it to our computer.
110

110

00:08:52,310  -->  00:08:56,060
So this takes some time, and here we have it.
111

111

00:08:57,674  -->  00:09:01,507
Right inside our folder, and that's extracted.
112

112

00:09:06,429  -->  00:09:07,774
And what do we have here?
113

113

00:09:07,774  -->  00:09:10,491
We have a bunch of files,
114

114

00:09:10,491  -->  00:09:13,574
but we actually only need two things.
115

115

00:09:15,507  -->  00:09:19,340
We need these CSS files, and these font files.
116

116

00:09:26,467  -->  00:09:30,384
We actually need this, ion icons mini file CSS.
117

117

00:09:31,621  -->  00:09:35,788
We will paste this inside our vendors folder, CSS,
118

118

00:09:37,937  -->  00:09:40,329
because you already know, it's a file that we got
119

119

00:09:40,329  -->  00:09:43,496
from the internet, and then the fonts,
120

120

00:09:47,945  -->  00:09:49,873
because it's an icon font.
121

121

00:09:49,873  -->  00:09:53,494
This also comes with the icons in form of images,
122

122

00:09:53,494  -->  00:09:55,327
but we want the fonts.
123

123

00:09:57,929  -->  00:10:01,679
So let's copy this entire folder and there's,
124

124

00:10:03,154  -->  00:10:06,312
okay there already was a folder here,
125

125

00:10:06,312  -->  00:10:10,479
so I will replace this, and this is our icon font here.
126

126

00:10:13,068  -->  00:10:15,577
And now, how do we use this?
127

127

00:10:15,577  -->  00:10:19,744
I actually shouldn't have closed that... ion icons.
128

128

00:10:23,634  -->  00:10:27,551
Because this is where we will choose our icons.
129

129

00:10:28,766  -->  00:10:32,933
Alright, but first, I will show you how we use it.
130

130

00:10:35,128  -->  00:10:39,295
So we want them right here, even before the heading.
131

131

00:10:44,021  -->  00:10:48,188
So we just write E class and then the name of an icon.
132

132

00:10:58,975  -->  00:11:02,725
For instance, imagine that we want this heart
133

133

00:11:04,502  -->  00:11:08,669
We just need to copy the name of this class, paste it here,
134

134

00:11:11,212  -->  00:11:13,998
and then we'll have a nice little heart.
135

135

00:11:13,998  -->  00:11:14,998 line:15% 
Want to see?
136

136

00:11:18,033  -->  00:11:21,615 line:15% 
Well of course not, because we didn't include
137

137

00:11:21,615  -->  00:11:23,032
the CSS file yet.
138

138

00:11:24,145  -->  00:11:28,312
So let's do that, I'll hit command D to duplicate this,
139

139

00:11:30,485  -->  00:11:33,818
and alright, here it is, ion icons, CSS,
140

140

00:11:38,263  -->  00:11:40,013
but now it will work.
141

141

00:11:42,141  -->  00:11:44,974 line:15% 
And here it is, here is our heart.
142

142

00:11:45,879  -->  00:11:50,046 line:15% 
It's not where I wanted it, let me go back, of course not.
143

143

00:11:54,378  -->  00:11:57,907 line:15% 
I don't want it in this place, I want it here
144

144

00:11:57,907  -->  00:12:01,657 line:15% 
right before the H3, so let me paste it here,
145

145

00:12:04,107  -->  00:12:07,107 line:15% 
and now I have this icon right here.
146

146

00:12:09,911  -->  00:12:12,304 line:15% 
So, but that's not the icon that I want
147

147

00:12:12,304  -->  00:12:16,205 line:15% 
for this feature here, so let's choose just another one.
148

148

00:12:16,205  -->  00:12:18,622 line:15% 
So "up to 365 days per year,"
149

149

00:12:21,318  -->  00:12:25,068
well which of these could look good for that?
150

150

00:12:28,674  -->  00:12:31,174
These are a lot, really a lot.
151

151

00:12:35,942  -->  00:12:40,109
You will need some time to go through all of them.
152

152

00:12:43,069  -->  00:12:46,809
And I choose to go with these icons here,
153

153

00:12:46,809  -->  00:12:50,976
these are IOS inspired, which you can see from the name,
154

154

00:12:52,359  -->  00:12:55,276
and I really like those line icons,
155

155

00:12:57,049  -->  00:13:00,973
so I will choose all icons of this class,
156

156

00:13:00,973  -->  00:13:03,829
so that we have some consistency here.
157

157

00:13:03,829  -->  00:13:07,996
And this looks great for the first feature, I think,
158

158

00:13:10,864  -->  00:13:13,744 line:15% 
because it's the infinity symbol,
159

159

00:13:13,744  -->  00:13:17,494 line:15% 
and 365 days per year is kind of an infinity.
160

160

00:13:22,056  -->  00:13:25,473 line:15% 
So the next one is "ready in 20 minutes."
161

161

00:13:26,654  -->  00:13:30,154 line:15% 
And we could use kind of a watch for that.
162

162

00:13:32,297  -->  00:13:33,880
Like this one here.
163

163

00:13:34,898  -->  00:13:38,148 line:15% 
So, copy it, paste it here, so I class.
164

164

00:13:47,018  -->  00:13:48,601 line:15% 
Paste and close it.
165

165

00:13:50,083  -->  00:13:53,500 line:15% 
And the next one is "100 % organic,"
166

166

00:13:54,844  -->  00:13:57,932 line:15% 
so let me see what we have for that.
167

167

00:13:57,932  -->  00:14:00,161 line:15% 
First let's check if they're showing up here.
168

168

00:14:00,161  -->  00:14:01,911 line:15% 
Okay, they are, cool.
169

169

00:14:03,133  -->  00:14:07,300 line:15% 
Now let me choose another one for the 100 % organic,
170

170

00:14:08,450  -->  00:14:11,700 line:15% 
I'm going with this little carrot here,
171

171

00:14:13,930  -->  00:14:17,680 line:15% 
so let me just write it here, I class, and...
172

172

00:14:23,752  -->  00:14:27,919 line:15% 
Last, but not least, we have the "order anything" feature,
173

173

00:14:31,275  -->  00:14:34,525 line:15% 
and that could be like a shopping cart,
174

174

00:14:35,920  -->  00:14:38,544
let's see if we find one.
175

175

00:14:38,544  -->  00:14:40,794
Here we go, copy and paste.
176

176

00:14:48,249  -->  00:14:50,666 line:15% 
Alright, so this is our HTML.
177

177

00:14:51,849  -->  00:14:54,983 line:15% 
In the next lecture, we will format this
178

178

00:14:54,983  -->  00:14:58,095 line:15% 
so that it looks professionally designed,
179

179

00:14:58,095  -->  00:15:02,095 line:15% 
so don't wait, come with me to the next lecture.
