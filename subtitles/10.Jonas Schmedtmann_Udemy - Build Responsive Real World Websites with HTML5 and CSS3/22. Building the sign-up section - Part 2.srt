00:00:01,531  -->  00:00:04,007
<v Voiceover>Hi, let's continue working</v>
2

2

00:00:04,007  -->  00:00:06,178
on the sign-up section.
3

3

00:00:06,178  -->  00:00:08,761
Let's write some more CSS code.
4

4

00:00:10,542  -->  00:00:11,709
So, back here.
5

5

00:00:12,798  -->  00:00:14,860
Let's start with the background color
6

6

00:00:14,860  -->  00:00:17,271
and I will show you why.
7

7

00:00:17,271  -->  00:00:22,189
So the first section we had was white, completely white.
8

8

00:00:22,189  -->  00:00:24,522
And the second one had these
9

9

00:00:25,435  -->  00:00:28,514
very subtle gray background color
10

10

00:00:28,514  -->  00:00:31,244
then the next one was white again.
11

11

00:00:31,244  -->  00:00:35,368
So now as you can guess, it's again time for a gray one.
12

12

00:00:35,368  -->  00:00:37,960
So that will be the first thing to do.
13

13

00:00:37,960  -->  00:00:42,488
And then of course, starting to build a structure
14

14

00:00:42,488  -->  00:00:45,738
for each of these pricing plan columns.
15

15

00:00:47,893  -->  00:00:50,707
So give here some white space,
16

16

00:00:50,707  -->  00:00:53,874
and starting to make this look better.
17

17

00:00:55,319  -->  00:00:56,736
So let's do that.
18

18

00:01:00,947  -->  00:01:04,280
So this section is called section-plans.
19

19

00:01:07,370  -->  00:01:10,421
I'll put some white space here
20

20

00:01:10,421  -->  00:01:12,921
so we can see what's going on.
21

21

00:01:22,166  -->  00:01:25,999
So the first thing here is a background color.
22

22

00:01:29,689  -->  00:01:33,106
And I don't remember, so I will just copy
23

23

00:01:34,520  -->  00:01:35,353
this one.
24

24

00:01:41,417  -->  00:01:44,084
Now, let me check our HTML code.
25

25

00:01:47,533  -->  00:01:51,033
So I'll start to format the plan-box here.
26

26

00:02:03,095  -->  00:02:05,595
Let's make this plan-box white
27

27

00:02:06,606  -->  00:02:10,773
so that it looks different than the background color
28

28

00:02:11,802  -->  00:02:14,052
of the rest of the section.
29

29

00:02:17,361  -->  00:02:19,111
And I will say, #fff.
30

30

00:02:21,179  -->  00:02:25,346
And I also want to give this some rounded corners.
31

31

00:02:26,486  -->  00:02:27,903
So, border-radius
32

32

00:02:32,436  -->  00:02:35,019
of, let's say five pixels here.
33

33

00:02:38,566  -->  00:02:42,733
I don't want it to be 100% of the parent width,
34

34

00:02:44,013  -->  00:02:45,680
so I will say width,
35

35

00:02:49,426  -->  00:02:50,676
ninety percent.
36

36

00:02:52,324  -->  00:02:55,528
And then I will use the same technique as we used before
37

37

00:02:55,528  -->  00:02:58,361
to center it inside of its parent.
38

38

00:02:59,318  -->  00:03:02,312
Just to show you again, the parent of this one
39

39

00:03:02,312  -->  00:03:03,645
is the call box.
40

40

00:03:07,147  -->  00:03:08,397
So margin-left,
41

41

00:03:09,836  -->  00:03:11,021
five percent,
42

42

00:03:11,021  -->  00:03:14,271
which is half of the remaining 10%
43

43

00:03:15,520  -->  00:03:16,770
from 90 to 100.
44

44

00:03:20,815  -->  00:03:22,815
And now let me see this.
45

45

00:03:25,704  -->  00:03:29,204
So this has already these rounded corners,
46

46

00:03:30,190  -->  00:03:32,267
and it's white.
47

47

00:03:32,267  -->  00:03:36,100
Now let's divide this into the three sections.
48

48

00:03:38,521  -->  00:03:42,438
But first let me explain you why I put this box
49

49

00:03:43,886  -->  00:03:48,053
into the column, such as I promised you I would explain you.
50

50

00:03:50,253  -->  00:03:52,816
So this situation here, why I created this div
51

51

00:03:52,816  -->  00:03:56,913
inside of the column, because if I hadn't,
52

52

00:03:56,913  -->  00:04:00,340
I wouldn't be able to make the plan-box as wide
53

53

00:04:00,340  -->  00:04:04,507
as I wanted it, only 90% with the white background color.
54

54

00:04:06,386  -->  00:04:10,580
It would not have been possible to do this
55

55

00:04:10,580  -->  00:04:14,747
by just formatting this column or adding some box here.
56

56

00:04:18,033  -->  00:04:21,616
So this was the solution that I had to use.
57

57

00:04:24,694  -->  00:04:28,611
So now let's section each of those subsections.
58

58

00:04:31,390  -->  00:04:35,390
And in order to do that, I will do it like this.
59

59

00:04:37,967  -->  00:04:41,800
Because, as we defined it, we have three divs:
60

60

00:04:43,414  -->  00:04:46,164
this one, this one, and this one.
61

61

00:04:48,388  -->  00:04:51,815
So I want them to have a padding
62

62

00:04:51,815  -->  00:04:54,232
of 15 pixels each, let's say.
63

63

00:04:57,387  -->  00:05:01,289
And what's also important is to make a
64

64

00:05:01,289  -->  00:05:03,894
little separation between them.
65

65

00:05:03,894  -->  00:05:08,061
We will have some border at the bottom of each of them.
66

66

00:05:09,383  -->  00:05:13,383
So a nice little border with a very light color,
67

67

00:05:14,747  -->  00:05:16,976
very subtle gray.
68

68

00:05:16,976  -->  00:05:19,893
So only one pixel in a solid color,
69

69

00:05:20,849  -->  00:05:22,897
and let's again start with white
70

70

00:05:22,897  -->  00:05:26,965
and then use the color picker to adjust the color.
71

71

00:05:26,965  -->  00:05:31,758
So a very subtle color here which we almost won't notice.
72

72

00:05:31,758  -->  00:05:34,392
So for example, this one.
73

73

00:05:34,392  -->  00:05:37,944
We will then check it, but for now we can just
74

74

00:05:37,944  -->  00:05:40,694
format some other things as well.
75

75

00:05:42,123  -->  00:05:44,456
Let me see what we got here.
76

76

00:05:45,467  -->  00:05:49,104
For example, this, let's start at the beginning.
77

77

00:05:49,104  -->  00:05:51,542
Now the HTree is already defined,
78

78

00:05:51,542  -->  00:05:54,709
so let's continue with the plan-price.
79

79

00:05:55,999  -->  00:05:59,749
And a plan-price, I want it to be really big.
80

80

00:06:02,673  -->  00:06:05,756
So font size, for instance 300%.
81

81

00:06:12,426  -->  00:06:16,159
And maybe a margin to the bottom, to that paragraph
82

82

00:06:16,159  -->  00:06:17,326
of ten pixels.
83

83

00:06:19,781  -->  00:06:23,281
And the next paragraph is plan-price-meal,
84

84

00:06:26,274  -->  00:06:28,378
if you remember.
85

85

00:06:28,378  -->  00:06:30,453
I don't know yet what to put here
86

86

00:06:30,453  -->  00:06:33,286
so let's just look at our website.
87

87

00:06:39,416  -->  00:06:40,735
Not bad, right?
88

88

00:06:40,735  -->  00:06:44,568
But this looks a little bit overwhelming here.
89

89

00:06:45,626  -->  00:06:48,886
And such as I told you, when you choose to use
90

90

00:06:48,886  -->  00:06:52,868
very big font sizes, the best thing to do
91

91

00:06:52,868  -->  00:06:56,035
is to actually reduce the font weight,
92

92

00:06:57,816  -->  00:06:59,307
which is what we're gonna do.
93

93

00:06:59,307  -->  00:07:02,057
And also we will reduce this text
94

94

00:07:03,653  -->  00:07:06,621
so we only want this to be this big.
95

95

00:07:06,621  -->  00:07:09,672
And there is actually an easy way to do this.
96

96

00:07:09,672  -->  00:07:13,838
Also I think this text is a little too big here,
97

97

00:07:13,838  -->  00:07:16,986
so let's make those changes.
98

98

00:07:16,986  -->  00:07:19,550
So first thing I will just decrease this here
99

99

00:07:19,550  -->  00:07:21,383
to let's say 80%.
100

100

00:07:25,942  -->  00:07:30,109
Then we should totally decrease the font weight here
101

101

00:07:33,980  -->  00:07:34,813
to 100.
102

102

00:07:36,210  -->  00:07:38,293
And let me show you this,
103

103

00:07:40,163  -->  00:07:42,016
so these are the options we have
104

104

00:07:42,016  -->  00:07:43,186
which we included at the beginning,
105

105

00:07:43,186  -->  00:07:45,603
100, 300, 400 and 300 italic.
106

106

00:07:47,101  -->  00:07:48,773
So I will use this font weight which is
107

107

00:07:48,773  -->  00:07:51,606
the lowest that we have available.
108

108

00:07:52,869  -->  00:07:57,271
And now we want to style this per-month text
109

109

00:07:57,271  -->  00:07:59,542
in a different way.
110

110

00:07:59,542  -->  00:08:03,117
And I will now show you another HTML element
111

111

00:08:03,117  -->  00:08:04,367
for doing that,
112

112

00:08:09,341  -->  00:08:10,636
which is this one.
113

113

00:08:10,636  -->  00:08:13,303
This is called span, and span...
114

114

00:08:15,108  -->  00:08:18,201
has only one purpose, basically.
115

115

00:08:18,201  -->  00:08:22,896
Its purpose is just to appear inside a paragraph,
116

116

00:08:22,896  -->  00:08:27,341
for example, and style some text in a different way
117

117

00:08:27,341  -->  00:08:31,508
than the rest, which is exactly what we want here.
118

118

00:08:32,468  -->  00:08:35,551
So the same thing goes for this here,
119

119

00:08:39,837  -->  00:08:41,004
and down here,
120

120

00:08:41,983  -->  00:08:45,650
with the difference that it's per-meal here.
121

121

00:08:47,082  -->  00:08:49,249
So we can now go ahead and
122

122

00:08:50,259  -->  00:08:52,842
format this in a different way.
123

123

00:08:55,051  -->  00:08:57,051
So we can say plan-price
124

124

00:09:01,572  -->  00:09:04,072
and then the span inside of it
125

125

00:09:05,612  -->  00:09:08,195
can have a different font size.
126

126

00:09:13,219  -->  00:09:16,219
Now the thing is that this span here
127

127

00:09:17,119  -->  00:09:19,725
is a child of this plan-price,
128

128

00:09:19,725  -->  00:09:22,642
which has a font size of 300%.
129

129

00:09:23,695  -->  00:09:27,612
Now if we would say font size equals 100%,
130

130

00:09:29,296  -->  00:09:33,782
then this 100% would not be the base size of 20 pixels,
131

131

00:09:33,782  -->  00:09:37,949
but this 300% because it is the parent font size.
132

132

00:09:41,585  -->  00:09:44,299
So if we want a smaller font size,
133

133

00:09:44,299  -->  00:09:47,355
we have to choose a very small number
134

134

00:09:47,355  -->  00:09:50,037
like for instance 30%.
135

135

00:09:50,037  -->  00:09:52,870
So, we have 30% of these 300,
136

136

00:09:56,246  -->  00:09:58,996
and not of the initial 20 pixels.
137

137

00:10:03,291  -->  00:10:07,060
And another thing is we want the font weight
138

138

00:10:07,060  -->  00:10:10,593
back to 300 here, because once again,
139

139

00:10:10,593  -->  00:10:13,150
this is the parent element, and it says
140

140

00:10:13,150  -->  00:10:14,733
font weight is 100.
141

141

00:10:17,306  -->  00:10:21,375
So this element will inherit that value
142

142

00:10:21,375  -->  00:10:23,666
and so in order to put it back to 300
143

143

00:10:23,666  -->  00:10:26,364
we have to specifically say, yeah,
144

144

00:10:26,364  -->  00:10:28,114
we want it to be 300.
145

145

00:10:29,593  -->  00:10:34,183
Another thing we can do here is to make this orange
146

146

00:10:34,183  -->  00:10:37,889
to stand out even more, this plan-price.
147

147

00:10:37,889  -->  00:10:39,790
As you remember, color should be used
148

148

00:10:39,790  -->  00:10:43,854
to draw attention to important element,
149

149

00:10:43,854  -->  00:10:48,583
and I think the price is pretty important here.
150

150

00:10:48,583  -->  00:10:52,750
So I will make it orange and it will stand out this way.
151

151

00:10:55,561  -->  00:10:59,348
Alright, so I think this first part here
152

152

00:10:59,348  -->  00:11:02,675
really looks quite nice, isn't it?
153

153

00:11:02,675  -->  00:11:06,342
So next let's take care of these lists here.
154

154

00:11:09,003  -->  00:11:11,336
So we just say, plan-box ul.
155

155

00:11:16,220  -->  00:11:19,220
And we want of course no list-style.
156

156

00:11:23,241  -->  00:11:26,265
And now let's add some white space
157

157

00:11:26,265  -->  00:11:28,598
between those list elements.
158

158

00:11:30,728  -->  00:11:34,228
So this is pretty straightforward as well.
159

159

00:11:38,379  -->  00:11:43,304
So for instance we can say we want a five pixel padding
160

160

00:11:43,304  -->  00:11:47,471
at the top and at the bottom of each of those elements
161

161

00:11:49,524  -->  00:11:51,357
and none on the sides.
162

162

00:11:53,988  -->  00:11:58,155
Now as for the icons, one thing that I should have done
163

163

00:11:59,211  -->  00:12:02,543
right from the beginning is to say that
164

164

00:12:02,543  -->  00:12:04,293
these are small icons
165

165

00:12:06,195  -->  00:12:09,390
with this class that we defined before.
166

166

00:12:09,390  -->  00:12:11,926
I hope you remember that.
167

167

00:12:11,926  -->  00:12:16,396
Since I forgot it, I will do this right now.
168

168

00:12:16,396  -->  00:12:19,063
So all of these are small icons.
169

169

00:12:27,303  -->  00:12:29,386
And let's check that out.
170

170

00:12:31,545  -->  00:12:33,934
Alright, this looks nice actually.
171

171

00:12:33,934  -->  00:12:36,892
So now let's center these one.
172

172

00:12:36,892  -->  00:12:39,250
And I also notice one strange thing
173

173

00:12:39,250  -->  00:12:43,378
which is since we don't have this paragraph here,
174

174

00:12:43,378  -->  00:12:44,795
we left it empty,
175

175

00:12:45,978  -->  00:12:49,218
this line completely disappeared.
176

176

00:12:49,218  -->  00:12:53,520
So what we have to do is to put a space there.
177

177

00:12:53,520  -->  00:12:55,020
So I will do that,
178

178

00:12:56,462  -->  00:12:57,925
and where is it?
179

179

00:12:57,925  -->  00:12:59,669
Here is the space.
180

180

00:12:59,669  -->  00:13:03,029
And in fact adding just a simple space, just like this
181

181

00:13:03,029  -->  00:13:04,784
will not do anything.
182

182

00:13:04,784  -->  00:13:07,775
We have to use a special character
183

183

00:13:07,775  -->  00:13:11,985
such as I told you before, there are those special
184

184

00:13:11,985  -->  00:13:13,985
HTML special characters.
185

185

00:13:15,122  -->  00:13:17,455
And for a space, it's &amp;nbsp,
186

186

00:13:21,477  -->  00:13:22,972
which you can find all of these
187

187

00:13:22,972  -->  00:13:25,427
in the course ebook.
188

188

00:13:25,427  -->  00:13:28,857
And hopefully this will solve that problem.
189

189

00:13:28,857  -->  00:13:30,498
Let's check this, yeah it does.
190

190

00:13:30,498  -->  00:13:32,665
So it's now an empty line.
191

191

00:13:34,171  -->  00:13:36,921
And now let's center this button.
192

192

00:13:38,085  -->  00:13:39,918
Should be pretty easy,
193

193

00:13:41,469  -->  00:13:43,969
maybe a good way to doing that
194

194

00:13:44,813  -->  00:13:47,896
is to simply select the last plan-box
195

195

00:13:51,531  -->  00:13:53,864
and then center its content.
196

196

00:13:55,822  -->  00:13:59,381
So we already learned that as well,
197

197

00:13:59,381  -->  00:14:02,172
so plan-box and then the div, and then simply
198

198

00:14:02,172  -->  00:14:04,005
select the last child.
199

199

00:14:09,052  -->  00:14:11,552
And we say text-align: center.
200

200

00:14:12,433  -->  00:14:14,075
Pretty easy.
201

201

00:14:14,075  -->  00:14:15,242
And that's it.
202

202

00:14:18,106  -->  00:14:21,243
Now you don't see those borders here
203

203

00:14:21,243  -->  00:14:25,225
because the box is selected, let me deselect it.
204

204

00:14:25,225  -->  00:14:27,256
Now you notice, maybe you don't see it,
205

205

00:14:27,256  -->  00:14:30,871
but here is a gray line and it's obvious because we
206

206

00:14:30,871  -->  00:14:33,255
define it that way, we said that
207

207

00:14:33,255  -->  00:14:37,042
all those three divs should have these lines,
208

208

00:14:37,042  -->  00:14:38,927
but of course the last one shouldn't,
209

209

00:14:38,927  -->  00:14:41,427
and so we will take that away.
210

210

00:14:43,348  -->  00:14:46,063
Another thing that we should do here, I think,
211

211

00:14:46,063  -->  00:14:49,769
is to maybe highlight this box here
212

212

00:14:49,769  -->  00:14:52,269
with a little gray background,
213

213

00:14:55,019  -->  00:14:59,186
something between this darker gray and this white here.
214

214

00:15:02,886  -->  00:15:05,303
So let's do those two things.
215

215

00:15:07,063  -->  00:15:10,346
So first thing we want no border at all,
216

216

00:15:10,346  -->  00:15:14,337
so border: none here in the last child.
217

217

00:15:14,337  -->  00:15:18,504
And the first child should have a nice background color.
218

218

00:15:21,903  -->  00:15:24,986
The secret here is to be very subtle.
219

219

00:15:26,828  -->  00:15:30,355
We want to make a difference, but a difference that
220

220

00:15:30,355  -->  00:15:32,355
doesn't pop out so much.
221

221

00:15:33,557  -->  00:15:36,694
We want to be subtle because that's a great way
222

222

00:15:36,694  -->  00:15:39,651
of doing beautiful design.
223

223

00:15:39,651  -->  00:15:42,151
So just say, background-color,
224

224

00:15:44,658  -->  00:15:46,741
again starting like this,
225

225

00:15:48,689  -->  00:15:52,189
and let's choose a great background color.
226

226

00:15:55,368  -->  00:15:57,535
This should be good, okay.
227

227

00:16:00,619  -->  00:16:03,237
It's actually hard to see, but it makes a difference
228

228

00:16:03,237  -->  00:16:04,154
believe me.
229

229

00:16:05,951  -->  00:16:09,118
So now these rounded buttons are gone.
230

230

00:16:10,551  -->  00:16:13,899
You probably don't see it because the video may be too small
231

231

00:16:13,899  -->  00:16:17,399
but these rounded borders are really gone.
232

232

00:16:19,344  -->  00:16:21,018
And I'm going to fix that in a moment.
233

233

00:16:21,018  -->  00:16:23,701
And now I wanted to show you another CSS property
234

234

00:16:23,701  -->  00:16:28,391
which is box-shadow, and we can add a nice effect here.
235

235

00:16:28,391  -->  00:16:31,280
Once again a very subtle box shadow,
236

236

00:16:31,280  -->  00:16:33,996
just so that I can show you how this works
237

237

00:16:33,996  -->  00:16:38,163
because the box shadow is a very much used CSS property.
238

238

00:16:39,961  -->  00:16:44,090
So I think it's important that you learn this as well.
239

239

00:16:44,090  -->  00:16:46,590
So fixing those border radius,
240

240

00:16:48,166  -->  00:16:50,833
I can say border-top-left-radius
241

241

00:16:54,395  -->  00:16:57,206
should have also those five pixels
242

242

00:16:57,206  -->  00:17:00,039
and border-top-right, five pixels.
243

243

00:17:03,465  -->  00:17:07,918
And now let's add a nice box shadow to the entire box
244

244

00:17:07,918  -->  00:17:10,501
and we will do this right here.
245

245

00:17:11,380  -->  00:17:15,380
So it's box-shadow, and now the first value here
246

246

00:17:18,116  -->  00:17:20,199
is for the x-axis offset.
247

247

00:17:24,025  -->  00:17:26,253
And we don't want any of that.
248

248

00:17:26,253  -->  00:17:30,414
Then the second one is for the y-axis offset,
249

249

00:17:30,414  -->  00:17:32,803
and I will say two pixels here,
250

250

00:17:32,803  -->  00:17:36,136
and now the blur I also want two pixels,
251

251

00:17:37,805  -->  00:17:40,472
and the last value is the color.
252

252

00:17:42,539  -->  00:17:46,289
And I will want a very subtle gray here again
253

253

00:17:47,936  -->  00:17:49,936
which is not so visible.
254

254

00:17:53,413  -->  00:17:56,746
I don't know, something like this maybe.
255

255

00:17:58,971  -->  00:18:00,054
So let's see.
256

256

00:18:02,402  -->  00:18:06,790
Now this was too dark, this was already too dark.
257

257

00:18:06,790  -->  00:18:09,927
So once again this is designing in a browser.
258

258

00:18:09,927  -->  00:18:13,510
We'll change the color until it looks good.
259

259

00:18:18,791  -->  00:18:21,109
You will not see this in this video
260

260

00:18:21,109  -->  00:18:24,170
because it's really subtle, but in your browser
261

261

00:18:24,170  -->  00:18:26,201
you will notice it, I'm sure.
262

262

00:18:26,201  -->  00:18:29,468
Alright, so we have one more section completed.
263

263

00:18:29,468  -->  00:18:32,183
Our website is almost done here.
264

264

00:18:32,183  -->  00:18:36,246
So we only have one more section and then the footer.
265

265

00:18:36,246  -->  00:18:38,240
This is great.
266

266

00:18:38,240  -->  00:18:42,407
So take a break now to digest all the things you learned
267

267

00:18:43,772  -->  00:18:47,684
so far, or come with me right to the next section
268

268

00:18:47,684  -->  00:18:50,934
where we'll build our simple HTML form.
