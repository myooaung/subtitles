<v Voiceover>Let's talk about</v>
2

2

00:00:02.275  -->  00:00:06.185
another very important aspect of visual design:
3

3

00:00:06.185  -->  00:00:09.598
How to design a layout using whitespace.
4

4

00:00:09.598  -->  00:00:13.360
Every piece of good design uses whitespace well.
5

5

00:00:13.360  -->  00:00:17.563
In fact, if you want to make a web site that looks designed,
6

6

00:00:17.563  -->  00:00:18.886
you need a lot of whitespace in
7

7

00:00:18.886  -->  00:00:21.553
the correct places on your site.
8

8

00:00:22.973  -->  00:00:25.109
So, what is whitespace?
9

9

00:00:25.109  -->  00:00:29.033
Whitespace is just space where there isn't any stuff.
10

10

00:00:29.033  -->  00:00:30.241
Easy.
11

11

00:00:30.241  -->  00:00:32.609
Whitespace absolutely is the key to create
12

12

00:00:32.609  -->  00:00:35.349
a clean and simple look and feel.
13

13

00:00:35.349  -->  00:00:38.484
This web site uses whitespace quite well.
14

14

00:00:38.484  -->  00:00:41.595
Look at the space between the icons and the text,
15

15

00:00:41.595  -->  00:00:45.403
the space between sections, between the section's headings
16

16

00:00:45.403  -->  00:00:49.188
and its content, and between paragraphs.
17

17

00:00:49.188  -->  00:00:52.393
This makes the web site look clean and inviting,
18

18

00:00:52.393  -->  00:00:56.560
all because it uses whitespace in a well-executed way.
19

19

00:00:57.896  -->  00:01:01.239
And this is the same web site, but without whitespace.
20

20

00:01:01.239  -->  00:01:03.306
Do you see the big difference?
21

21

00:01:03.306  -->  00:01:05.558
There is like no room to breathe here.
22

22

00:01:05.558  -->  00:01:08.786
Everything looks bulky and unthoughtful.
23

23

00:01:08.786  -->  00:01:11.119
Definitely not what we want.
24

24

00:01:12.617  -->  00:01:16.681
So based on this, the first guidelines are quite simple,
25

25

00:01:16.681  -->  00:01:19.653
and it's actually easier than it may sound.
26

26

00:01:19.653  -->  00:01:22.695
Just put whitespace between your elements.
27

27

00:01:22.695  -->  00:01:26.108
Put whitespace between your groups of elements.
28

28

00:01:26.108  -->  00:01:29.707
Put whitespace between your web site's sections.
29

29

00:01:29.707  -->  00:01:32.842
But don't exaggerate because when elements
30

30

00:01:32.842  -->  00:01:35.558
are spaced out too much, they may lose
31

31

00:01:35.558  -->  00:01:38.624
the relationships to one another.
32

32

00:01:38.624  -->  00:01:41.271
So don't use too much whitespace.
33

33

00:01:41.271  -->  00:01:43.778
You have to be careful with this.
34

34

00:01:43.778  -->  00:01:46.681
And with this, you will see how your web site
35

35

00:01:46.681  -->  00:01:50.848
will look nice and clean, professionally designed.
36

36

00:01:52.555  -->  00:01:55.133
Now with the whitespace that you add,
37

37

00:01:55.133  -->  00:01:57.478
you describe invisible relationships
38

38

00:01:57.478  -->  00:02:00.659
between the elements of your web site.
39

39

00:02:00.659  -->  00:02:03.608
You communicate how the pieces of information relate
40

40

00:02:03.608  -->  00:02:07.184
to one another, and this is very important.
41

41

00:02:07.184  -->  00:02:09.669
So whitespace is closely related
42

42

00:02:09.669  -->  00:02:13.268
to something we call visual hierarchy.
43

43

00:02:13.268  -->  00:02:16.611
This is the organization of your content.
44

44

00:02:16.611  -->  00:02:19.676
Let's go back to our previous web site example.
45

45

00:02:19.676  -->  00:02:22.115
Again, the text here is very small,
46

46

00:02:22.115  -->  00:02:24.506
but that's not what matters here.
47

47

00:02:24.506  -->  00:02:26.828
Just look at the way whitespace is used on
48

48

00:02:26.828  -->  00:02:31.008
this web site to define the different sections.
49

49

00:02:31.008  -->  00:02:33.864
We can clearly see where each section begins,
50

50

00:02:33.864  -->  00:02:37.370
just through the correct use of whitespace.
51

51

00:02:37.370  -->  00:02:40.737
And that's what hierarchy is all about, actually.
52

52

00:02:40.737  -->  00:02:44.070
So again, whitespace is really powerful.
53

53

00:02:45.102  -->  00:02:47.355
Hierarchies give your web site order,
54

54

00:02:47.355  -->  00:02:51.093
and so it's kind of important that you get it right.
55

55

00:02:51.093  -->  00:02:52.951
And how do you do it?
56

56

00:02:52.951  -->  00:02:56.248
Just design with having three simple guidelines in mind,
57

57

00:02:56.248  -->  00:02:58.454
and you should be fine.
58

58

00:02:58.454  -->  00:03:02.308
First, define where you want your audience to look first.
59

59

00:03:02.308  -->  00:03:05.141
Also, establish a flow that corresponds
60

60

00:03:05.141  -->  00:03:07.556
to your content's message.
61

61

00:03:07.556  -->  00:03:09.971
Because hierarchy is exactly that.
62

62

00:03:09.971  -->  00:03:14.313
It guides the user from one element to the next.
63

63

00:03:14.313  -->  00:03:18.480
And then, use whitespace to build that exact flow.
64

64

00:03:19.979  -->  00:03:23.670
So concluding, in this lecture, we learned that whitespace
65

65

00:03:23.670  -->  00:03:27.837
is a powerful tool to create well-defined content hierarchy.
66

66

00:03:28.756  -->  00:03:30.288
Using whitespace right can make
67

67

00:03:30.288  -->  00:03:33.284
a web site look clean and simple.
68

68

00:03:33.284  -->  00:03:36.534
So this was quite an important lecture.
