00:00:01.664  -->  00:00:04.159
<v Voiceover>So far, we have placed headings,</v>
2

2

00:00:04.159  -->  00:00:07.991
paragraphs, and images on our blog post webpage.
3

3

00:00:07.991  -->  00:00:12.063
Another very important thing in webpages are links,
4

4

00:00:12.063  -->  00:00:13.967
so let's go back to the little webpage
5

5

00:00:13.967  -->  00:00:16.134
that we were playing with.
6

6

00:00:17.871  -->  00:00:21.284
So, links are defined with the a tag,
7

7

00:00:21.284  -->  00:00:23.745
which stands for anchor.
8

8

00:00:23.745  -->  00:00:25.858
And we used the href attribute to tell
9

9

00:00:25.858  -->  00:00:29.086
the browser where the link should take us.
10

10

00:00:29.086  -->  00:00:33.149
For example, let's link to the Udemy website.
11

11

00:00:33.149  -->  00:00:36.482
Let's do it right here after this image.
12

12

00:00:39.571  -->  00:00:42.238
And as I said, we used an a tag,
13

13

00:00:43.704  -->  00:00:45.371
with href attribute.
14

14

00:00:47.768  -->  00:00:51.668
So, the link to the Udemy website is an external link,
15

15

00:00:51.668  -->  00:00:55.314
because that website doesn't make part of our project.
16

16

00:00:55.314  -->  00:00:57.218
So in that case we have to indicate
17

17

00:00:57.218  -->  00:01:00.864
the complete path to the website we want to link to,
18

18

00:01:00.864  -->  00:01:05.031
which means that it has to start with http://.
19

19

00:01:06.924  -->  00:01:09.341
For Udemy, that would be http
20

20

00:01:12.404  -->  00:01:15.571
//www.udemy.com.
21

21

00:01:19.532  -->  00:01:21.158
Alright, and now I close it,
22

22

00:01:21.158  -->  00:01:25.325
and here goes the text that will appear on the webpage.
23

23

00:01:26.499  -->  00:01:27.999
So, link to Udemy.
24

24

00:01:29.842  -->  00:01:32.745
So let's see if this works.
25

25

00:01:32.745  -->  00:01:34.162
Click right here,
26

26

00:01:35.647  -->  00:01:39.455
and yeah, it takes us to the Udemy website.
27

27

00:01:39.455  -->  00:01:40.288
Alright.
28

28

00:01:42.381  -->  00:01:44.378
Now, back in Brackets,
29

29

00:01:44.378  -->  00:01:46.961
we see this message right here,
30

30

00:01:48.488  -->  00:01:51.901
and this happened because we left the webpage
31

31

00:01:51.901  -->  00:01:53.364
we were working on.
32

32

00:01:53.364  -->  00:01:55.245
And so, the connection between Brackets
33

33

00:01:55.245  -->  00:01:57.328
and the browser was lost.
34

34

00:01:59.029  -->  00:02:00.779
So, let's close this,
35

35

00:02:01.746  -->  00:02:03.163
and hit it again.
36

36

00:02:07.993  -->  00:02:11.781
Okay, now the connection is back up.
37

37

00:02:11.781  -->  00:02:14.588
A solution for this would be
38

38

00:02:14.588  -->  00:02:17.420
to open the link in a new tab, right.
39

39

00:02:17.420  -->  00:02:20.137
Sometimes that's actually right thing to do.
40

40

00:02:20.137  -->  00:02:22.157
So I'll show you how to do that.
41

41

00:02:22.157  -->  00:02:23.295
It's quite easy,
42

42

00:02:23.295  -->  00:02:26.616
we just need to define the target attribute.
43

43

00:02:26.616  -->  00:02:30.075
So target, and then from these four options,
44

44

00:02:30.075  -->  00:02:32.408
we choose the blank options.
45

45

00:02:34.139  -->  00:02:36.368
And now let's test it again.
46

46

00:02:36.368  -->  00:02:38.618
I click here, okay, and so,
47

47

00:02:39.874  -->  00:02:42.624
the Udemy site opens in a new tab
48

48

00:02:43.473  -->  00:02:47.049
without leaving our original blog post.
49

49

00:02:47.049  -->  00:02:48.071
So if we close this,
50

50

00:02:48.071  -->  00:02:51.090
we are just back to our webpage.
51

51

00:02:51.090  -->  00:02:55.269
We can also link to any document inside our current project.
52

52

00:02:55.269  -->  00:02:57.939
For example, other webpages,
53

53

00:02:57.939  -->  00:02:59.774
which is very important,
54

54

00:02:59.774  -->  00:03:02.235
or even images, or other documents,
55

55

00:03:02.235  -->  00:03:05.254
and those will be internal links.
56

56

00:03:05.254  -->  00:03:07.950
So let's just add a link to the HTML image
57

57

00:03:07.950  -->  00:03:09.200
we used before.
58

58

00:03:11.535  -->  00:03:14.785
And I will do it right after this link.
59

59

00:03:15.668  -->  00:03:16.918
So again, the a
60

60

00:03:18.640  -->  00:03:19.473
href
61

61

00:03:21.334  -->  00:03:24.084
and I will choose this logo here.
62

62

00:03:25.305  -->  00:03:28.222
And again, we want it in a new tab.
63

63

00:03:33.176  -->  00:03:34.926
I will say HTML logo.
64

64

00:03:42.557  -->  00:03:44.724
Okay, and this also works.
65

65

00:03:46.087  -->  00:03:50.057
So you see, we cannot only link to other websites,
66

66

00:03:50.057  -->  00:03:53.640
but also to other documents such as images.
67

67

00:03:57.000  -->  00:03:58.788
These were links.
68

68

00:03:58.788  -->  00:04:01.040
Now you know how to make internal links
69

69

00:04:01.040  -->  00:04:04.128
and external links to other webpages.
70

70

00:04:04.128  -->  00:04:05.382
Congratulations,
71

71

00:04:05.382  -->  00:04:08.912
you made it to the end of the introductory HTML section.
72

72

00:04:08.912  -->  00:04:10.162
That's awesome!
73

73

00:04:11.094  -->  00:04:13.509
Remember, that this section was designed
74

74

00:04:13.509  -->  00:04:16.249
to make you familiar with HTML.
75

75

00:04:16.249  -->  00:04:19.918
So far, we covered the basic structure of a webpage,
76

76

00:04:19.918  -->  00:04:24.051
headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
77

77

00:04:24.051  -->  00:04:26.698
We'll start to really work with HTML
78

78

00:04:26.698  -->  00:04:31.133
when we're gonna start with our killer website project.
79

79

00:04:31.133  -->  00:04:32.782
But before we do that,
80

80

00:04:32.782  -->  00:04:34.941
the next section I'll introduce CSS
81

81

00:04:34.941  -->  00:04:37.774
to style the HTML we just created.
82

82

00:04:38.912  -->  00:04:41.025
Now to end this HTML section,
83

83

00:04:41.025  -->  00:04:43.277
make sure you take the following quiz
84

84

00:04:43.277  -->  00:04:46.296
to remember some things you learned so far.
85

85

00:04:46.296  -->  00:04:47.463
So, good luck.
