<v Voiceover>Search Engine Optimization</v>
2

2

00:00:03.095  -->  00:00:04.721
is a very hot topic.
3

3

00:00:04.721  -->  00:00:07.362
That's because it's so incredibly important
4

4

00:00:07.362  -->  00:00:10.248
that your website can be found by your users
5

5

00:00:10.248  -->  00:00:13.081
using a search engine like Google.
6

6

00:00:14.306  -->  00:00:16.764
This is, of course, still part of step five
7

7

00:00:16.764  -->  00:00:18.847
of our seven step method.
8

8

00:00:20.116  -->  00:00:23.814
And now, what is Search Engine Optimization?
9

9

00:00:23.814  -->  00:00:27.898
Very simple, basically Search Engine Optimization
10

10

00:00:27.898  -->  00:00:31.839
or CEO is a couple of techniques that improve
11

11

00:00:31.839  -->  00:00:34.298
and promote a website to increase the number
12

12

00:00:34.298  -->  00:00:37.792
of visitors the site receives from search engines.
13

13

00:00:37.792  -->  00:00:41.287
There are many, many aspects to CEO,
14

14

00:00:41.287  -->  00:00:44.903
and in this lecture we will just cover the very basics
15

15

00:00:44.903  -->  00:00:48.986
in order to make our website search engine ready.
16

16

00:00:49.901  -->  00:00:53.864
So first up, let's talk about the meta description tags.
17

17

00:00:53.864  -->  00:00:56.992
This tag is a short description of a website
18

18

00:00:56.992  -->  00:00:59.613
and is normally used to describe a website
19

19

00:00:59.613  -->  00:01:03.436
on the search results page, just as we see here
20

20

00:01:03.436  -->  00:01:05.934
on this Udemy example.
21

21

00:01:05.934  -->  00:01:08.271
This text is not visible to visitors
22

22

00:01:08.271  -->  00:01:10.221
of the webpage itself,
23

23

00:01:10.221  -->  00:01:13.147
but it helps you to advertise for your site,
24

24

00:01:13.147  -->  00:01:17.312
drawing users to your website from the search results.
25

25

00:01:17.312  -->  00:01:20.319
It is, therefore, an extremely important part
26

26

00:01:20.319  -->  00:01:23.529
of search marketing, so we should craft
27

27

00:01:23.529  -->  00:01:26.841
compelling description using important keywords,
28

28

00:01:26.841  -->  00:01:29.924
but with no more than 160 characters.
29

29

00:01:31.444  -->  00:01:35.277
Let's now, of course, do that for our webpage.
30

30

00:01:37.316  -->  00:01:40.566
All right, so nothing easier than that.
31

31

00:01:41.724  -->  00:01:45.161
We just use here the meta tag and then say
32

32

00:01:45.161  -->  00:01:46.578
name description,
33

33

00:01:49.134  -->  00:01:51.934
and then we say our content.
34

34

00:01:51.934  -->  00:01:54.789
Something about Omnifoot,
35

35

00:01:54.789  -->  00:01:56.539
Omnifoot is a premium
36

36

00:01:58.336  -->  00:01:59.419
foot delivery
37

37

00:02:01.862  -->  00:02:03.862
service with the mission
38

38

00:02:06.962  -->  00:02:08.545
to bring affordable
39

39

00:02:10.883  -->  00:02:12.300
and healthy meals
40

40

00:02:14.390  -->  00:02:16.890
to as many people as possible.
41

41

00:02:20.058  -->  00:02:22.891
So something like this, all right?
42

42

00:02:23.776  -->  00:02:26.286
Okay, and since we are talking about tags,
43

43

00:02:26.286  -->  00:02:30.228
we should also include the content type tag.
44

44

00:02:30.228  -->  00:02:33.895
Just like this, you can actually do it here.
45

45

00:02:35.247  -->  00:02:36.080
So, meta,
46

46

00:02:40.927  -->  00:02:43.927
and then charge that, and then udf8.
47

47

00:02:44.839  -->  00:02:48.894
This is just used to declare the character encoding
48

48

00:02:48.894  -->  00:02:51.169
of the website, but it doesn't include the ranking.
49

49

00:02:51.169  -->  00:02:55.134
It has nothing to do with Search Engine Optimization,
50

50

00:02:55.134  -->  00:02:56.820
but it's something that we should include
51

51

00:02:56.820  -->  00:02:58.237
in every website.
52

52

00:03:01.127  -->  00:03:04.127
For the meta description, that's it.
53

53

00:03:06.390  -->  00:03:10.557
Back here, next, we should always write valid HTML code,
54

54

00:03:11.814  -->  00:03:14.578
and valid HTML code is code that follows
55

55

00:03:14.578  -->  00:03:19.271
exactly the official HTML rules and has no bugs.
56

56

00:03:19.271  -->  00:03:22.197
Valid HTML is preferred by Google,
57

57

00:03:22.197  -->  00:03:24.452
it makes websites more likely to work
58

58

00:03:24.452  -->  00:03:26.565
in browsers we haven't tested,
59

59

00:03:26.565  -->  00:03:28.293
it looks more professional,
60

60

00:03:28.293  -->  00:03:30.609
and it's better for accessibility,
61

61

00:03:30.609  -->  00:03:32.864
making it easier for screen readers
62

62

00:03:32.864  -->  00:03:37.171
to read websites to blind users, for instance.
63

63

00:03:37.171  -->  00:03:39.101
There is an official tool for checking
64

64

00:03:39.101  -->  00:03:41.734
if we have valid HTML code,
65

65

00:03:41.734  -->  00:03:44.484
and we're gonna use it right now.
66

66

00:03:46.612  -->  00:03:49.925
In order to do that, we just copy the entire code,
67

67

00:03:49.925  -->  00:03:54.092
so Command or Control + A, and then copied it
68

68

00:03:55.869  -->  00:03:59.993
and this is the website, so Validatorw3,
69

69

00:03:59.993  -->  00:04:03.337
and be used options, so validate by direct input
70

70

00:04:03.337  -->  00:04:07.420
and paste all our code here, and now we check it.
71

71

00:04:09.514  -->  00:04:11.681
It takes it a little time.
72

72

00:04:15.426  -->  00:04:19.144
We have eight errors here in our code, actually.
73

73

00:04:19.144  -->  00:04:22.644
Let's see what those errors are all about.
74

74

00:04:25.626  -->  00:04:26.844
All right, this has something to do with
75

75

00:04:26.844  -->  00:04:29.177
these closing tags, I guess.
76

76

00:04:30.152  -->  00:04:31.819
Let me go back here.
77

77

00:04:33.992  -->  00:04:36.860
All right, so we actually forgot to close
78

78

00:04:36.860  -->  00:04:38.443
this meta tag here.
79

79

00:04:40.903  -->  00:04:42.653
Let's copy that again
80

80

00:04:45.791  -->  00:04:47.985
and delete all of this.
81

81

00:04:47.985  -->  00:04:51.068
Copy and re-validate the whole thing.
82

82

00:04:55.096  -->  00:04:56.802
Now we only have three errors.
83

83

00:04:56.802  -->  00:04:59.200
Much better, right?
84

84

00:04:59.200  -->  00:05:01.232
Let's see what it is.
85

85

00:05:01.232  -->  00:05:04.982
So an Img element must have an alt attribute.
86

86

00:05:05.985  -->  00:05:08.499
OK, can see we have three errors,
87

87

00:05:08.499  -->  00:05:12.666
and that's because we forgot to specify the alt attribute
88

88

00:05:13.619  -->  00:05:16.119
for our three customary metas.
89

89

00:05:18.080  -->  00:05:20.580
Okay, so I'm going to do that.
90

90

00:05:24.714  -->  00:05:28.881
We have it, they're right here, see the alternative text.
91

91

00:05:33.411  -->  00:05:36.161
I'll just say customer one photo.
92

92

00:05:38.998  -->  00:05:41.081
And I'm going to copy it,
93

93

00:05:44.911  -->  00:05:46.078
three and two.
94

94

00:05:50.428  -->  00:05:53.178
So again, and I think that by now
95

95

00:05:55.379  -->  00:05:58.224
we have a validated HTML code.
96

96

00:05:58.224  -->  00:05:59.307
So let's see,
97

97

00:06:05.782  -->  00:06:07.754
all right, very well, this document
98

98

00:06:07.754  -->  00:06:10.587
was successfully checked as HTML5.
99

99

00:06:11.431  -->  00:06:14.275
So, we have now a valid HTML document.
100

100

00:06:14.275  -->  00:06:15.358
Great, right?
101

101

00:06:17.404  -->  00:06:21.061
Now the next thing, content is king,
102

102

00:06:21.061  -->  00:06:23.641
and that means that it's very important
103

103

00:06:23.641  -->  00:06:26.668
that you have great content on your website.
104

104

00:06:26.668  -->  00:06:29.838
Even if your website is on top of the search results,
105

105

00:06:29.838  -->  00:06:31.687
if the content is not great,
106

106

00:06:31.687  -->  00:06:34.226
and your users don't want to read it,
107

107

00:06:34.226  -->  00:06:37.600
then it's worth nothing that you're so high ranked.
108

108

00:06:37.600  -->  00:06:41.175
Also, keep providing new content if you can,
109

109

00:06:41.175  -->  00:06:45.342
so your visitors want to keep coming back for more.
110

110

00:06:47.880  -->  00:06:50.724
The next thing is that you need to place keywords
111

111

00:06:50.724  -->  00:06:53.529
strategically in your content.
112

112

00:06:53.529  -->  00:06:56.697
This is a key to perform well in search rankings,
113

113

00:06:56.697  -->  00:07:00.863
because keywords are what users actually use to find you.
114

114

00:07:00.863  -->  00:07:04.012
But be careful, don't overuse keywords,
115

115

00:07:04.012  -->  00:07:07.527
since search engines consider that as keyword spamming
116

116

00:07:07.527  -->  00:07:09.884
and might penalize you.
117

117

00:07:09.884  -->  00:07:13.379
Use keywords in the title, in the meta description tag,
118

118

00:07:13.379  -->  00:07:15.712
in your headings, and links.
119

119

00:07:17.747  -->  00:07:19.079
And another important thing,
120

120

00:07:19.079  -->  00:07:22.208
is to get other websites to link to you.
121

121

00:07:22.208  -->  00:07:25.093
These links are called backlinks
122

122

00:07:25.093  -->  00:07:29.705
and are like letters of recommendation for your website.
123

123

00:07:29.705  -->  00:07:32.203
Search engines rank websites based partially
124

124

00:07:32.203  -->  00:07:34.827
on the number and the quality
125

125

00:07:34.827  -->  00:07:38.077
of links that point to the site.
126

126

00:07:38.077  -->  00:07:41.633
This is a crucial factor to CEO and therefore,
127

127

00:07:41.633  -->  00:07:43.603
you should have a strategy to increase
128

128

00:07:43.603  -->  00:07:47.770
the quantity and quality of backlinks to your site.
129

129

00:07:49.476  -->  00:07:51.547
There's actually so much more information
130

130

00:07:51.547  -->  00:07:54.717
about CEO out there on the internet.
131

131

00:07:54.717  -->  00:07:56.159
For a quick overview,
132

132

00:07:56.159  -->  00:07:59.512
you can check out the link in a course eBook.
133

133

00:07:59.512  -->  00:08:02.194
We changed some things in our project
134

134

00:08:02.194  -->  00:08:05.404
in this section, so please download the final website
135

135

00:08:05.404  -->  00:08:08.675
from the link in the description of this video.
136

136

00:08:08.675  -->  00:08:11.621
And that's it with optimization.
137

137

00:08:11.621  -->  00:08:13.145
So in the next lecture,
138

138

00:08:13.145  -->  00:08:17.312
let's learn how to launch our website to the internet.
