00:00:01.050  -->  00:00:04.505
<v Voiceover>Welcome to the last video about jQuery.</v>
2

2

00:00:04.505  -->  00:00:08.417
In this lecture we'll create the responsive navigation.
3

3

00:00:08.417  -->  00:00:11.002
When we made our website responsive,
4

4

00:00:11.002  -->  00:00:12.682
we simply hid the navigation
5

5

00:00:12.682  -->  00:00:15.265
for width less than 768 pixels.
6

6

00:00:16.877  -->  00:00:18.673
Now, it's time to bring it back
7

7

00:00:18.673  -->  00:00:21.673
and make it responsive using jQuery.
8

8

00:00:23.099  -->  00:00:26.452
So, what do I mean by responsive navigation?
9

9

00:00:26.452  -->  00:00:29.999
Well this is the normal navigation that we styled before.
10

10

00:00:29.999  -->  00:00:33.126
Now as I reduce the browser width,
11

11

00:00:33.126  -->  00:00:35.391
I want this to happen.
12

12

00:00:35.391  -->  00:00:36.396
You see that?
13

13

00:00:36.396  -->  00:00:39.104
Now we have this icon here,
14

14

00:00:39.104  -->  00:00:40.687
and when we hit it,
15

15

00:00:41.726  -->  00:00:44.220
our navigation comes down here.
16

16

00:00:44.220  -->  00:00:45.183
Right?
17

17

00:00:45.183  -->  00:00:48.516
So you're probably are quite used to this
18

18

00:00:48.516  -->  00:00:50.421
type of navigation
19

19

00:00:50.421  -->  00:00:55.118
because all kinds of responsive websites use it these days.
20

20

00:00:55.118  -->  00:00:56.784
And we can see it down here as well,
21

21

00:00:56.784  -->  00:01:00.910
so we click here and then all of this comes down.
22

22

00:01:00.910  -->  00:01:03.731
And we can close and open it
23

23

00:01:03.731  -->  00:01:05.428
as we want.
24

24

00:01:05.428  -->  00:01:07.896
So, how do we do this?
25

25

00:01:07.896  -->  00:01:11.041
First, we need to, of course,
26

26

00:01:11.041  -->  00:01:14.440
put this button here inside our HTML file.
27

27

00:01:14.440  -->  00:01:17.763
And then we need to style all of this here
28

28

00:01:17.763  -->  00:01:20.415
in a CSS file, in the media query.
29

29

00:01:20.415  -->  00:01:23.115
And in the end, we will use jQuery
30

30

00:01:23.115  -->  00:01:25.544
to add this animation here.
31

31

00:01:25.544  -->  00:01:28.023
And also to change this button style here
32

32

00:01:28.023  -->  00:01:30.728
whenever we click on it.
33

33

00:01:30.728  -->  00:01:32.395
So let's go do that.
34

34

00:01:37.930  -->  00:01:40.735
So first as I said in the HTML file,
35

35

00:01:40.735  -->  00:01:43.318
we're going to add that button,
36

36

00:01:44.376  -->  00:01:45.295
in the navigation.
37

37

00:01:45.295  -->  00:01:46.545
So it is, okay,
38

38

00:01:47.860  -->  00:01:48.989
right here.
39

39

00:01:48.989  -->  00:01:51.944
So we have the images, then we have the navigation,
40

40

00:01:51.944  -->  00:01:55.509
and then in the end we want that button.
41

41

00:01:55.509  -->  00:01:57.009
It will be a link.
42

42

00:01:59.048  -->  00:02:02.798
And a class that I will call mobile nav icon.
43

43

00:02:06.638  -->  00:02:10.805
Alright, and now we need that icon that we saw before.
44

44

00:02:13.267  -->  00:02:14.347
Just close this.
45

45

00:02:14.347  -->  00:02:17.670
So the icon, as before, we will get it from
46

46

00:02:17.670  -->  00:02:18.753
our Ionicons.
47

47

00:02:22.185  -->  00:02:25.017
And we have these three here,
48

48

00:02:25.017  -->  00:02:27.881
and I am going to choose this one.
49

49

00:02:27.881  -->  00:02:32.048
You can of course use one of the other ones if you like to.
50

50

00:02:33.203  -->  00:02:35.817
So I will put this right here.
51

51

00:02:35.817  -->  00:02:38.400
And next I am gonna style this.
52

52

00:02:39.358  -->  00:02:41.525
So I grab this class name,
53

53

00:02:42.759  -->  00:02:45.759
and where do we have our navigation.
54

54

00:02:47.809  -->  00:02:48.642
Alright.
55

55

00:02:52.578  -->  00:02:54.681
So we already have the main navi,
56

56

00:02:54.681  -->  00:02:56.094
and the sticky navi,
57

57

00:02:56.094  -->  00:02:59.094
and I'm gonna call this mobile navi.
58

58

00:03:04.792  -->  00:03:08.959
First thing is to float this to the right side, right?
59

59

00:03:10.548  -->  00:03:14.005
And, we can set some margin to the top
60

60

00:03:14.005  -->  00:03:15.338
of three pixels.
61

61

00:03:17.753  -->  00:03:19.561
And then I want the cursor
62

62

00:03:19.561  -->  00:03:22.165
to show up as a pointer.
63

63

00:03:22.165  -->  00:03:24.969
And let me show you why I'm going to do this.
64

64

00:03:24.969  -->  00:03:26.739
So this is an a class,
65

65

00:03:26.739  -->  00:03:30.318
but if we do not specify the href attribute,
66

66

00:03:30.318  -->  00:03:32.262
which I will not do here.
67

67

00:03:32.262  -->  00:03:35.954
Then we will not have that pointer.
68

68

00:03:35.954  -->  00:03:38.007
Let me show it to you.
69

69

00:03:38.007  -->  00:03:41.090
So I mean this pointer, so this hand.
70

70

00:03:42.773  -->  00:03:46.948
So in that case, I need to specify that to know,
71

71

00:03:46.948  -->  00:03:48.027
and I will say
72

72

00:03:48.027  -->  00:03:49.277
cursor pointer.
73

73

00:03:53.554  -->  00:03:56.304
Alright, so let's check this out.
74

74

00:04:01.607  -->  00:04:03.993
It's here right now,
75

75

00:04:03.993  -->  00:04:08.160
and that is because this navigation here is still visible.
76

76

00:04:08.995  -->  00:04:11.780
So I of course don't want to see it,
77

77

00:04:11.780  -->  00:04:14.875
for now, so I will make this display none.
78

78

00:04:14.875  -->  00:04:17.411
Such as we did many times before,
79

79

00:04:17.411  -->  00:04:18.744
so display none.
80

80

00:04:22.402  -->  00:04:26.152
And I also need to style the actual icon, so,
81

81

00:04:29.916  -->  00:04:31.839
this element is i element.
82

82

00:04:31.839  -->  00:04:34.474
So in the other icons we always define their class
83

83

00:04:34.474  -->  00:04:36.365
like icon big,
84

84

00:04:36.365  -->  00:04:39.039
but in this case, it's not necessary.
85

85

00:04:39.039  -->  00:04:41.856
'Cause we only use it in this place,
86

86

00:04:41.856  -->  00:04:44.356
so I just say mobile nav icon,
87

87

00:04:47.208  -->  00:04:50.301
and then the i element inside of it.
88

88

00:04:50.301  -->  00:04:51.884
So I say font size,
89

89

00:04:53.943  -->  00:04:56.253
let's say 200%,
90

90

00:04:56.253  -->  00:04:58.086
and then color, white.
91

91

00:05:03.391  -->  00:05:04.224
Okay.
92

92

00:05:05.666  -->  00:05:08.833
And now, let's go to our queries, CSS,
93

93

00:05:11.018  -->  00:05:13.185
and style that navigation.
94

94

00:05:16.214  -->  00:05:17.381
So right here.
95

95

00:05:19.392  -->  00:05:20.786
So this is what we had,
96

96

00:05:20.786  -->  00:05:24.119
but this is no longer what we want here.
97

97

00:05:25.315  -->  00:05:27.956
Let me just, instead of deleting it just now,
98

98

00:05:27.956  -->  00:05:29.956
I want to leave it here.
99

99

00:05:31.074  -->  00:05:33.692
So again, this is the code that will
100

100

00:05:33.692  -->  00:05:37.109
apply once the width is below 767 pixels.
101

101

00:05:39.009  -->  00:05:42.243
So now I want that icon to show up actually,
102

102

00:05:42.243  -->  00:05:43.826
so mobile nav icon,
103

103

00:05:48.990  -->  00:05:52.490
and I wanna display it as an inline-block.
104

104

00:05:53.737  -->  00:05:56.237
Alright, so let me check that.
105

105

00:06:03.306  -->  00:06:04.223
Here it is.
106

106

00:06:05.079  -->  00:06:07.829
But I actually want this on the right side,
107

107

00:06:07.829  -->  00:06:10.993
and the navigation more on the left side.
108

108

00:06:10.993  -->  00:06:12.076
So I will say
109

109

00:06:14.064  -->  00:06:17.647
that the main nav should float to the left.
110

110

00:06:21.617  -->  00:06:23.867
Float to the left, alright.
111


111

00:06:25.136  -->  00:06:27.131
And now we want those elements
112

112

00:06:27.131  -->  00:06:29.485
no longer to be side by side,
113

113

00:06:29.485  -->  00:06:31.485
but one under the other.
114

114

00:06:33.741  -->  00:06:36.077
So that is quite easy as well.
115

115

00:06:36.077  -->  00:06:40.077
Main nav and all the li elements inside of them.
116

116

00:06:41.161  -->  00:06:43.114
What I do with them now is to
117

117

00:06:43.114  -->  00:06:45.364
say display them as blocks,
118

118

00:06:46.335  -->  00:06:49.822
and no longer as inline-blocks, as they were before.
119

119

00:06:49.822  -->  00:06:51.929
So they will now force a line break,
120

120

00:06:51.929  -->  00:06:54.999
and so we have all those links stacked
121

121

00:06:54.999  -->  00:06:56.249
on one another.
122

122

00:06:58.018  -->  00:07:02.539
And let me also style the actual link elements
123

123

00:07:02.539  -->  00:07:03.996
inside of them.
124

124

00:07:03.996  -->  00:07:05.579
So a and then link.
125

125

00:07:10.084  -->  00:07:11.667
And visited, right?
126

126

00:07:15.015  -->  00:07:18.598
So I want them to display as block as well.
127

127

00:07:19.932  -->  00:07:22.637
And you know, they should have no border now
128

128

00:07:22.637  -->  00:07:25.304
because on a mobile phone
129

129

00:07:25.304  -->  00:07:27.437
we cannot hover anything,
130

130

00:07:27.437  -->  00:07:30.126
so we don't need any border.
131

131

00:07:30.126  -->  00:07:32.543
So we can just do this, okay.
132

132

00:07:34.497  -->  00:07:35.330
So.
133

133

00:07:42.169  -->  00:07:45.680
Alright, so this looks quite as we want it so far.
134

134

00:07:45.680  -->  00:07:47.702
Now we just need to reduce
135

135

00:07:47.702  -->  00:07:50.231
the margin to the top a little bit,
136

136

00:07:50.231  -->  00:07:53.787
and then maybe we can also increase
137

137

00:07:53.787  -->  00:07:55.381
maybe the font size here,
138

138

00:07:55.381  -->  00:07:57.342
looks a little too small, I think.
139

139

00:07:57.342  -->  00:08:00.779
We had it set to 90% and we can
140

140

00:08:00.779  -->  00:08:02.362
set it back to 100.
141

141

00:08:04.105  -->  00:08:07.938
We just look, how it looks down here, alright.
142

142

00:08:10.678  -->  00:08:13.540
So, reduce the margin here
143

143

00:08:13.540  -->  00:08:18.245
and maybe add some padding between those links as well.
144

144

00:08:18.245  -->  00:08:20.035
So let me actually see
145

145

00:08:20.035  -->  00:08:22.285
how the main nav is styled.
146

146

00:08:25.876  -->  00:08:29.959
Alright, so we have a margin-top of currently 55.
147

147

00:08:36.842  -->  00:08:40.426
But I want it to be, I don't know, 25 for now,
148

148

00:08:40.426  -->  00:08:43.633
and also some margin on the left side,
149

149

00:08:43.633  -->  00:08:45.466
of also 25, let's say.
150

150

00:08:49.043  -->  00:08:50.919
Okay, and now the links,
151

151

00:08:50.919  -->  00:08:53.836
they may have a padding of 5 pixels
152

152

00:08:56.302  -->  00:08:58.385
on top and on the bottom,
153

153

00:08:59.770  -->  00:09:01.658
and then zero left and right.
154

154

00:09:01.658  -->  00:09:03.325
So let's check this.
155

155

00:09:06.229  -->  00:09:07.655
Okay, great.
156

156

00:09:07.655  -->  00:09:10.901
Maybe we can even say 10 pixels,
157

157

00:09:10.901  -->  00:09:11.901
and 25 here,
158

158

00:09:13.296  -->  00:09:15.212
that doesn't look enough.
159

159

00:09:15.212  -->  00:09:16.879
So, on top maybe 35,
160

160

00:09:21.853  -->  00:09:23.211
and here 10.
161

161

00:09:23.211  -->  00:09:24.709
And as I said before,
162

162

00:09:24.709  -->  00:09:27.688
I will increase the font size as well,
163

163

00:09:27.688  -->  00:09:28.771
to 100%.
164

164

00:09:30.249  -->  00:09:32.732
And now this should do the job.
165

165

00:09:32.732  -->  00:09:33.565
Alright.
166

166

00:09:38.770  -->  00:09:41.240
So what we also need to do, of course,
167

167

00:09:41.240  -->  00:09:44.073
is to style the sticky navigation.
168

168

00:09:47.715  -->  00:09:50.147
Let me just copy all of this,
169

169

00:09:50.147  -->  00:09:52.328
and I will then later
170

170

00:09:52.328  -->  00:09:55.388
delete the stuff that I don't want.
171

171

00:09:55.388  -->  00:09:59.364
So you see this is a lot of work to do,
172

172

00:09:59.364  -->  00:10:02.116
and it's quite confused,
173

173

00:10:02.116  -->  00:10:04.949
but well, you still need to do it.
174

174

00:10:07.077  -->  00:10:10.470
Let me set it to 10 pixels here as well,
175

175

00:10:10.470  -->  00:10:14.637
and the color, doesn't really matter here for now.
176

176

00:10:20.506  -->  00:10:22.506
And this also, the same.
177

177

00:10:26.816  -->  00:10:28.983
And we can say this to 10.
178

178

00:10:31.383  -->  00:10:33.837
So let's check this out.
179

179

00:10:33.837  -->  00:10:35.515
Alright, great.
180

180

00:10:35.515  -->  00:10:37.792
Now only one more thing which is
181

181

00:10:37.792  -->  00:10:40.209
to make this icon here black.
182

182

00:10:41.684  -->  00:10:44.994
In the sticky navigation, right?
183

183

00:10:44.994  -->  00:10:48.327
Otherwise we will not be able to see it.
184

184

00:10:49.230  -->  00:10:50.213
So it's simple,
185

185

00:10:50.213  -->  00:10:52.130
sticky mobile nav icon,
186

186

00:10:56.617  -->  00:10:58.450
and then i, and color,
187

187

00:11:01.319  -->  00:11:03.069
555, such as the rest
188

188

00:11:04.657  -->  00:11:05.846
of the webpage.
189

189

00:11:05.846  -->  00:11:09.596
And now this will look exactly as we want it.
190

190

00:11:11.039  -->  00:11:14.480
Actually not, actually we want less space now.
191

191

00:11:14.480  -->  00:11:16.480
Let me check this again.
192

192

00:11:18.396  -->  00:11:21.214
So we have 30 pixels now and,
193

193

00:11:21.214  -->  00:11:23.797
that's way too much, of course.
194

194

00:11:25.219  -->  00:11:26.719
So duplicate this,
195

195

00:11:27.876  -->  00:11:30.043
and margin-top, 10 pixels.
196

196

00:11:37.026  -->  00:11:38.359
Okay now, great.
197

197

00:11:39.487  -->  00:11:41.987
So, now comes the jQuery part.
198

198

00:11:43.716  -->  00:11:47.254
We need to start by hiding this again.
199

199

00:11:47.254  -->  00:11:50.106
Because, of course, when we open the webpage,
200

200

00:11:50.106  -->  00:11:52.189
this will not be visible.
201

201

00:11:53.768  -->  00:11:55.881
And then, when we hit this button here,
202

202

00:11:55.881  -->  00:11:57.798
it will become visible.
203

203

00:11:58.717  -->  00:11:59.967
Okay, so let me
204

204

00:12:02.953  -->  00:12:05.689
take those comments away.
205

205

00:12:05.689  -->  00:12:09.010
Because then the display will be none again,
206

206

00:12:09.010  -->  00:12:10.927
so this will be hidden.
207

207

00:12:12.685  -->  00:12:14.323
And now let's define
208

208

00:12:14.323  -->  00:12:17.823
what happens when we click on that button.
209

209

00:12:21.159  -->  00:12:22.409
Back to jQuery.
210

210

00:12:26.898  -->  00:12:28.398
Mobile navigation.
211

211

00:12:31.575  -->  00:12:34.702
So let's define a class for JavaScript
212

212

00:12:34.702  -->  00:12:36.702
when we hit this button.
213

213

00:12:38.734  -->  00:12:40.371
Such as we always do,
214

214

00:12:40.371  -->  00:12:43.602
and this will be nav icon, very simple,
215

215

00:12:43.602  -->  00:12:45.990
so we just copy this
216

216

00:12:45.990  -->  00:12:48.247
because now we need to select it
217

217

00:12:48.247  -->  00:12:49.830
here in the jQuery.
218

218

00:12:52.437  -->  00:12:53.354
So, and now
219

219

00:12:56.631  -->  00:12:59.746
if you can imagine this, this is click,
220

220

00:12:59.746  -->  00:13:00.829
and function.
221

221

00:13:05.247  -->  00:13:07.771
And now let's use something new,
222

222

00:13:07.771  -->  00:13:09.516
which is called variables.
223

223

00:13:09.516  -->  00:13:13.460
So in programming we have something called variables,
224

224

00:13:13.460  -->  00:13:15.790
where we can store things.
225

225

00:13:15.790  -->  00:13:17.457
And here I will simply create
226

226

00:13:17.457  -->  00:13:19.290
a variable called nav,
227

227

00:13:21.336  -->  00:13:23.919
and what this variable will be,
228

228

00:13:24.962  -->  00:13:28.871
is the result of selecting the navigation.
229

229

00:13:28.871  -->  00:13:31.371
So let me just show it to you.
230

230

00:13:32.812  -->  00:13:33.895
So, main nav.
231

231

00:13:37.341  -->  00:13:39.562
And actually we should create
232

232

00:13:39.562  -->  00:13:41.642
the class for that as well.
233

233

00:13:41.642  -->  00:13:43.392
So here, js main nav.
234

234

00:13:51.609  -->  00:13:54.534
So, and I did this because
235

235

00:13:54.534  -->  00:13:58.069
I will have to use this many times now,
236

236

00:13:58.069  -->  00:14:00.178
and I don't want to repeat
237

237

00:14:00.178  -->  00:14:03.137
this code here all over again, and again, and again.
238

238

00:14:03.137  -->  00:14:05.054
So I define a variable,
239

239

00:14:05.972  -->  00:14:08.288
and then I can use that variable instead of
240

240

00:14:08.288  -->  00:14:10.705
always writing the same code.
241

241

00:14:12.398  -->  00:14:14.847
So now what are we gonna do with this?
242

242

00:14:14.847  -->  00:14:16.597
There's a very simple
243

243

00:14:18.834  -->  00:14:20.051
jQuery method,
244

244

00:14:20.051  -->  00:14:22.992
which is just called slide toggle.
245

245

00:14:22.992  -->  00:14:24.464
And all this does
246

246

00:14:24.464  -->  00:14:26.714
is to open and close a box.
247

247

00:14:27.649  -->  00:14:29.711
And we will see that in a minute.
248

248

00:14:29.711  -->  00:14:32.907
And here, in this method we have to
249

249

00:14:32.907  -->  00:14:36.372
just say how many time the animation shall take.
250

250

00:14:36.372  -->  00:14:39.269
And we will say 0.2 seconds,
251

251

00:14:39.269  -->  00:14:41.436
which is 200 milliseconds.
252

252

00:14:43.201  -->  00:14:44.368
Such as here,
253

253

00:14:44.368  -->  00:14:46.587
where we said we wanted
254

254

00:14:46.587  -->  00:14:50.562
a thousand milliseconds, here we want 200.
255

255

00:14:50.562  -->  00:14:53.070
And this is actually all it takes
256

256

00:14:53.070  -->  00:14:56.153
to create that open and close effect.
257

257

00:14:58.628  -->  00:15:01.720
So we click here and it opens, and it closes, and it opens,
258

258

00:15:01.720  -->  00:15:02.887
and it closes.
259

259

00:15:05.859  -->  00:15:09.764
This creates exactly what we want, right?
260

260

00:15:09.764  -->  00:15:12.909
So now there's only one thing left to do,
261

261

00:15:12.909  -->  00:15:16.580
which is to change the icon of this,
262

262

00:15:16.580  -->  00:15:18.346
each time we click it.
263

263

00:15:18.346  -->  00:15:20.763
So, if this is the menu icon,
264

264

00:15:22.698  -->  00:15:23.900
we want it to be like
265

265

00:15:23.900  -->  00:15:25.453
cross to close it,
266

266

00:15:25.453  -->  00:15:27.080
and when it's a cross,
267

267

00:15:27.080  -->  00:15:29.747
we want it to be the close icon.
268

268

00:15:30.706  -->  00:15:33.146
Really straight forward, right?
269

269

00:15:33.146  -->  00:15:35.979
So first of all let's grab an icon
270

270

00:15:38.315  -->  00:15:41.898
for that, and it will be this one, I think.
271

271

00:15:44.016  -->  00:15:46.933
So make this a little bigger again.
272

272

00:15:48.368  -->  00:15:49.951
So this looks good.
273

273

00:15:53.997  -->  00:15:56.554
So this was the first part of the code,
274

274

00:15:56.554  -->  00:15:59.299
let me just copy this here, I'll use it now.
275

275

00:15:59.299  -->  00:16:02.299
And so, how can we change that icon?
276

276

00:16:03.902  -->  00:16:05.438
It's easier to explain here.
277

277

00:16:05.438  -->  00:16:09.521
So, the icon is essentially defined by the class.
278

278

00:16:10.804  -->  00:16:13.160
So, if we want to change the icon,
279

279

00:16:13.160  -->  00:16:16.335
we can simply change the class.
280

280

00:16:16.335  -->  00:16:19.076
And we already did that before,
281

281

00:16:19.076  -->  00:16:22.740
with the add class and the remove class.
282

282

00:16:22.740  -->  00:16:25.323
So we will now do exactly that.
283

283

00:16:27.053  -->  00:16:29.530
And I will in fact create a new variable here
284

284

00:16:29.530  -->  00:16:30.530
called icon.
285

285

00:16:33.753  -->  00:16:38.675
So that I don't have to repeat that code later again.
286

286

00:16:38.675  -->  00:16:41.092
And this is now js nav icon i
287

287

00:16:43.764  -->  00:16:45.764
because that is in fact,
288

288

00:16:48.269  -->  00:16:51.895
the class or the element which has
289

289

00:16:51.895  -->  00:16:54.110
the class with the icon.
290

290

00:16:54.110  -->  00:16:57.661
So now I can make a simple if again,
291

291

00:16:57.661  -->  00:16:59.911
which is to take decisions.
292

292

00:17:00.929  -->  00:17:02.346
So I say, if icon
293

293

00:17:05.167  -->  00:17:09.885
has class, so this is something new we didn't see before.
294

294

00:17:09.885  -->  00:17:11.135
And I will say,
295

295

00:17:17.072  -->  00:17:20.822
ion nav icon round so this is the class name.
296

296

00:17:25.352  -->  00:17:27.799
Well then do something,
297

297

00:17:27.799  -->  00:17:28.716
and if not,
298

298

00:17:29.661  -->  00:17:31.578
then do something else.
299

299

00:17:34.072  -->  00:17:36.155
So again, so if the icon,
300

300

00:17:37.347  -->  00:17:40.707
which means if the element we select here
301

301

00:17:40.707  -->  00:17:43.457
has the class ion nav icon round,
302

302

00:17:44.507  -->  00:17:46.257
then we want the icon
303

303

00:17:48.981  -->  00:17:50.814
to have another class.
304

304

00:17:51.814  -->  00:17:53.314
Which is this one.
305

305

00:17:57.898  -->  00:17:59.401
So we want to add this one
306

306

00:17:59.401  -->  00:18:02.234
and we want to remove the old one.
307

307

00:18:03.682  -->  00:18:05.015
So remove class,
308

308

00:18:07.358  -->  00:18:08.858
and then this one.
309

309

00:18:10.228  -->  00:18:13.478
So this will simply exchange the icons.
310

310

00:18:15.155  -->  00:18:18.105
So when it is the navigation icon,
311

311

00:18:18.105  -->  00:18:19.838
take that navigation icon away
312

312

00:18:19.838  -->  00:18:22.804
and put the close icon instead.
313

313

00:18:22.804  -->  00:18:25.138
And if it's the other way around,
314

314

00:18:25.138  -->  00:18:26.055
then, well,
315

315

00:18:28.208  -->  00:18:29.958
then add the nav icon
316

316

00:18:31.197  -->  00:18:32.947
and remove the close.
317

317

00:18:36.990  -->  00:18:40.240
And now we have all situations covered.
318

318

00:18:42.857  -->  00:18:45.445
So this should work now.
319

319

00:18:45.445  -->  00:18:49.297
I just need to correct this one here.
320

320

00:18:49.297  -->  00:18:52.047
And now we should be ready to go.
321

321

00:18:54.185  -->  00:18:55.339
And here we go.
322

322

00:18:55.339  -->  00:18:58.006
This works exactly as we wanted.
323

323

00:18:59.665  -->  00:19:01.915
And up here as well, great.
324

324

00:19:02.893  -->  00:19:03.726
Very good.
325

325

00:19:04.817  -->  00:19:08.725
So we have all kinds of effects now here on our webpage,
326

326

00:19:08.725  -->  00:19:11.308
even if the responsive version,
327

327

00:19:12.564  -->  00:19:14.397
it all works the same.
328

328

00:19:15.848  -->  00:19:17.462
Fantastic.
329

329

00:19:17.462  -->  00:19:21.379
So, this is all I had to show you about jQuery.
330

330

00:19:22.659  -->  00:19:25.397
jQuery has endless possibilities,
331

331

00:19:25.397  -->  00:19:28.371
and there is still so much to learn.
332

332

00:19:28.371  -->  00:19:30.511
And there are in fact entire books
333

333

00:19:30.511  -->  00:19:34.109
and online courses devoted to teach you jQuery.
334

334

00:19:34.109  -->  00:19:38.128
So you see, this is a really huge topic,
335

335

00:19:38.128  -->  00:19:41.290
but I think you know some of the basics now.
336

336

00:19:41.290  -->  00:19:43.731
And that actually enables you to write some simple code
337

337

00:19:43.731  -->  00:19:46.262
on your own, or to include
338

338

00:19:46.262  -->  00:19:48.543
one of the many, many jQuery plugins
339

339

00:19:48.543  -->  00:19:50.597
into your project.
340

340

00:19:50.597  -->  00:19:53.514
And that is already quite powerful.
341

341

00:19:54.581  -->  00:19:56.977
Now as before, you can find a link,
342

342

00:19:56.977  -->  00:19:58.609
where you can download the entire project
343

343

00:19:58.609  -->  00:20:00.173
we've built so far,
344

344

00:20:00.173  -->  00:20:03.650
in the description of this video.
345

345

00:20:03.650  -->  00:20:05.636
Now in the next couple of lectures,
346

346

00:20:05.636  -->  00:20:07.298
we'll optimize this webpage,
347

347

00:20:07.298  -->  00:20:09.965
and then learn how to launch it.
