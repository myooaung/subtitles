00:00:01,691  -->  00:00:04,137
<v Voiceover>So far we have developed a website</v>
2

2

00:00:04,137  -->  00:00:08,608
and used the Google Chrome browser to see how it looks.
3

3

00:00:08,608  -->  00:00:11,745
In an ideal world we would be able to create
4

4

00:00:11,745  -->  00:00:14,764
our site using everything we've learned so far.
5

5

00:00:14,764  -->  00:00:18,318
And the website would look great in any browser.
6

6

00:00:18,318  -->  00:00:21,034
Now, unfortunately each browser interprets
7

7

00:00:21,034  -->  00:00:24,451
HTML and CSS in a slightly different way.
8

8

00:00:25,400  -->  00:00:27,072
Which means that a website may appear
9

9

00:00:27,072  -->  00:00:31,112
differently to visitors using different browsers.
10

10

00:00:31,112  -->  00:00:34,061
So, once we've created our website we have to
11

11

00:00:34,061  -->  00:00:37,382
review how it appears on multiple browsers.
12

12

00:00:37,382  -->  00:00:40,145
This is very very important.
13

13

00:00:40,145  -->  00:00:42,281
The most popular browsers right now
14

14

00:00:42,281  -->  00:00:46,448
are Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari.
15

15

00:00:47,621  -->  00:00:49,456
Here we have the world wide market share
16

16

00:00:49,456  -->  00:00:53,171
of all browsers as of January 2015.
17

17

00:00:53,171  -->  00:00:55,145
And here we see that Google Chrome
18

18

00:00:55,145  -->  00:00:58,478
has almost 50% of the market share.
19

19

00:01:00,049  -->  00:01:02,740
Now the first thing we have to do in
20

20

00:01:02,740  -->  00:01:05,771
order to make CSS3 work the same way
21

21

00:01:05,771  -->  00:01:09,938
in every browser is prefixing some CSS3 properties.
22

22

00:01:11,646  -->  00:01:14,177
And CSS3 browser prefixes are a way
23

23

00:01:14,177  -->  00:01:16,867
for browser makers to add support
24

24

00:01:16,867  -->  00:01:20,950
for new CSS features in a kind of testing period.
25

25

00:01:22,974  -->  00:01:27,848
Here are CSS browser prefixes for different browsers.
26

26

00:01:27,848  -->  00:01:32,353
So it's webkit for Android, Chrome, IOS and Safari browsers
27

27

00:01:32,353  -->  00:01:36,520
moz for Firefox, ms for Internet Explorer and o for Opera.
28

28

00:01:40,558  -->  00:01:43,413
And here is an example for the border radius property
29

29

00:01:43,413  -->  00:01:46,386
with different browser prefixes.
30

30

00:01:46,386  -->  00:01:49,341
With this code the boarder radius property
31

31

00:01:49,341  -->  00:01:53,380
will work even on older browsers of Chrome or Firefox.
32

32

00:01:53,380  -->  00:01:55,075
Because the older versions of the modern
33

33

00:01:55,075  -->  00:01:57,118
browsers always cause the biggest
34

34

00:01:57,118  -->  00:01:59,618
problems to us web developers.
35

35

00:02:01,159  -->  00:02:02,320
Now it seems a little bit boring
36

36

00:02:02,320  -->  00:02:06,360
to add all these prefixes manually, right?
37

37

00:02:06,360  -->  00:02:08,543
Good news is we don't have to.
38

38

00:02:08,543  -->  00:02:10,354
Because there is another great bracket
39

39

00:02:10,354  -->  00:02:13,558
extension that does the job for us.
40

40

00:02:13,558  -->  00:02:17,225
So let's go back to brackets and install it.
41

41

00:02:18,429  -->  00:02:20,774
So, the extension we're going to install
42

42

00:02:20,774  -->  00:02:23,480
is called autoprefixer.
43

43

00:02:23,480  -->  00:02:27,503
So again hit here to extensions button
44

44

00:02:27,503  -->  00:02:30,920
and now right here we write autoprefixer.
45

45

00:02:34,697  -->  00:02:36,392
So then you hit install here.
46

46

00:02:36,392  -->  00:02:41,175
I already have it installed so I will not do it.
47

47

00:02:41,175  -->  00:02:44,171
So I hope you have it installed by now.
48

48

00:02:44,171  -->  00:02:45,842
And now it's very very easy.
49

49

00:02:45,842  -->  00:02:50,009
We just select all the code hitting command a or control a.
50

50

00:02:51,253  -->  00:02:53,760
And then we come to this edit menu
51

51

00:02:53,760  -->  00:02:57,731
and down here we have autoprefix selection.
52

52

00:02:57,731  -->  00:03:00,424
So we hit that button and now all
53

53

00:03:00,424  -->  00:03:03,373
the relevant properties are prefixed.
54

54

00:03:03,373  -->  00:03:07,274
So let's scroll down here and see what we have for instance.
55

55

00:03:07,274  -->  00:03:11,441
So here, the transition property was prefixed for webkit.
56

56

00:03:14,357  -->  00:03:17,027
And this extension is actually previously marked
57

57

00:03:17,027  -->  00:03:20,533
because it only prefixes the properties
58

58

00:03:20,533  -->  00:03:23,435
that need prefixing in each browser.
59

59

00:03:23,435  -->  00:03:25,711
So in this case all webkit browsers.
60

60

00:03:25,711  -->  00:03:29,044
Such as Chrome, IOS, Android and Safari.
61

61

00:03:30,007  -->  00:03:33,174
So again we have the webkit transition
62

62

00:03:34,281  -->  00:03:36,072
and we show what else we have.
63

63

00:03:36,072  -->  00:03:37,567
Here we have to transform property
64

64

00:03:37,567  -->  00:03:41,734
and this is for webkit and for the Internet Explorer.
65

65

00:03:43,363  -->  00:03:45,831
So we see this is pretty smart.
66

66

00:03:45,831  -->  00:03:48,998
Here again and it helps us do our job.
67

67

00:03:50,957  -->  00:03:54,534
And we should do the same here in this CSS file.
68

68

00:03:54,534  -->  00:03:58,701
So again, command a and then we hit autoprefix selection.
69

69

00:04:02,358  -->  00:04:04,289
And to be absolutely sure we can
70

70

00:04:04,289  -->  00:04:08,141
do the same here in our grid CSS file.
71

71

00:04:08,141  -->  00:04:09,273
I actually don't know if this is
72

72

00:04:09,273  -->  00:04:12,940
necessary but we'll do it just to make sure.
73

73

00:04:18,076  -->  00:04:21,083
Now all our code is prefixed.
74

74

00:04:21,083  -->  00:04:22,894
So we should now test our website
75

75

00:04:22,894  -->  00:04:26,894
on the four major browsers as I told you before.
76

76

00:04:27,794  -->  00:04:30,301
So Google Chrome here obviously not necessary because
77

77

00:04:30,301  -->  00:04:33,258
we already know it works well with it
78

78

00:04:33,258  -->  00:04:37,778
since we used it all the time to test our website.
79

79

00:04:37,778  -->  00:04:39,861
So next up I have Safari.
80

80

00:04:41,911  -->  00:04:45,093
So this is the Google Chrome browser.
81

81

00:04:45,093  -->  00:04:46,676
Now I have Firefox.
82

82

00:04:48,138  -->  00:04:52,055
So let me open my index page HTML file with it.
83

83

00:04:59,533  -->  00:05:01,950
Alright, so this is Firefox.
84

84

00:05:04,038  -->  00:05:06,894
And well we see that everything works
85

85

00:05:06,894  -->  00:05:11,061
exactly the way as it works in Google Chrome right?
86

86

00:05:13,256  -->  00:05:17,006
So no problems here everything's fine, great.
87

87

00:05:19,943  -->  00:05:23,360
And now I will test it on Safari as well.
88

88

00:05:25,261  -->  00:05:27,844
I have it opened here actually.
89

89

00:05:37,483  -->  00:05:39,036
Doesn't work this way okay so I will
90

90

00:05:39,036  -->  00:05:40,869
make open with Safari.
91

91

00:05:45,785  -->  00:05:47,035
And here we go.
92

92

00:05:48,101  -->  00:05:51,654
Again let's test it, let's see if everything works.
93

93

00:05:51,654  -->  00:05:54,071
So all these animations work.
94

94

00:05:55,369  -->  00:05:56,952
All our effects and
95

95

00:05:59,464  -->  00:06:03,295
so things look a little different here.
96

96

00:06:03,295  -->  00:06:05,989
For instance this box here looks different in Chrome.
97

97

00:06:05,989  -->  00:06:07,419
But that's nothing we could change.
98

98

00:06:07,419  -->  00:06:09,958
That's really something which has to do
99

99

00:06:09,958  -->  00:06:13,208
with the browser and operating systems.
100

100

00:06:14,902  -->  00:06:17,990
Now for PC users they can not test their website
101

101

00:06:17,990  -->  00:06:21,682
on Safari because it only runs on a Mac.
102

102

00:06:21,682  -->  00:06:25,096
But maybe you can use a Mac from a friend or so
103

103

00:06:25,096  -->  00:06:29,263
and test if your webpage looks good with the Safari browser.
104

104

00:06:30,831  -->  00:06:33,734
And then we have the Internet Explorer and this time
105

105

00:06:33,734  -->  00:06:36,125
the Mac users have the problem because
106

106

00:06:36,125  -->  00:06:40,119
we cannot install the Internet Explorer on a Mac.
107

107

00:06:40,119  -->  00:06:42,371
So I will actually not be able to show
108

108

00:06:42,371  -->  00:06:46,388
you how it looks like on the Internet Explorer.
109

109

00:06:46,388  -->  00:06:48,478
So if you have a Mac and you want to test
110

110

00:06:48,478  -->  00:06:51,079
if your website looks good on a Internet Explorer
111

111

00:06:51,079  -->  00:06:53,354
you can for example ask a friend of yours
112

112

00:06:53,354  -->  00:06:56,326
which has a Windows computer and see if your
113

113

00:06:56,326  -->  00:07:00,409
website looks great on Internet Explorer as well.
114

114

00:07:01,830  -->  00:07:04,671
So actually on the newer version of the Internet Explorer
115

115

00:07:04,671  -->  00:07:08,754
like 11 or 10 everything we did should look fine.
116

116

00:07:11,141  -->  00:07:13,231
The most problematic browsers are the older
117

117

00:07:13,231  -->  00:07:16,814
versions like Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8
118

118

00:07:18,736  -->  00:07:21,524
because many of the CSS3 styles
119

119

00:07:21,524  -->  00:07:23,683
don't work on these browsers.
120

120

00:07:23,683  -->  00:07:25,866
They are still around but for us
121

121

00:07:25,866  -->  00:07:29,720
web developers hopefully not forever.
122

122

00:07:29,720  -->  00:07:32,298
And we will not concentrate so much on these
123

123

00:07:32,298  -->  00:07:34,527
older versions because that would require
124

124

00:07:34,527  -->  00:07:36,610
very specific techniques.
125

125

00:07:37,662  -->  00:07:39,357
And actually there is a rather
126

126

00:07:39,357  -->  00:07:42,933
complex way of using the Internet Explorer on a Mac.
127

127

00:07:42,933  -->  00:07:45,115
And to find out more about that check
128

128

00:07:45,115  -->  00:07:47,282
out the link in the ebook.
129

129

00:07:48,296  -->  00:07:51,385
Now there are however some things that we can do
130

130

00:07:51,385  -->  00:07:54,032
in order to make some of the parts
131

131

00:07:54,032  -->  00:07:58,032
of our website work great in older web browsers.
132

132

00:07:59,435  -->  00:08:03,459
So we will use three JavaScript scripts to enable some of
133

133

00:08:03,459  -->  00:08:07,338
the new functionalities in older browsers.
134

134

00:08:07,338  -->  00:08:09,868
The first one there is a little script called
135

135

00:08:09,868  -->  00:08:13,700
respond.js which enables the browser to understand
136

136

00:08:13,700  -->  00:08:16,974
and execute CSS media queries which we
137

137

00:08:16,974  -->  00:08:19,557
need for responsive web design.
138

138

00:08:21,474  -->  00:08:23,224
So let me close this.
139

139

00:08:25,121  -->  00:08:29,069
There is this website JsDelivr where we can get
140

140

00:08:29,069  -->  00:08:31,736
many scripts like that for free.
141

141

00:08:33,573  -->  00:08:37,312
More on that later in the next section.
142

142

00:08:37,312  -->  00:08:40,312
But for now let's just type respond.
143

143

00:08:42,862  -->  00:08:45,862
Okay here we go and hit integration.
144

144

00:08:47,273  -->  00:08:50,190
All we need to do is copy this code
145

145

00:08:52,962  -->  00:08:57,129
and paste it at the bottom of our HTML file right here.
146

146

00:08:59,046  -->  00:09:03,213
So really after the body we paste our script files.
147

147

00:09:04,851  -->  00:09:06,615
So again we will learn more about
148

148

00:09:06,615  -->  00:09:09,820
JavaScript in the next lecture.
149

149

00:09:09,820  -->  00:09:13,987
But for now, let's just copy those scripts right here.
150

150

00:09:15,160  -->  00:09:16,716
So the second script I'm going to
151

151

00:09:16,716  -->  00:09:19,618
use here is called HTML5Shiv.
152

152

00:09:19,618  -->  00:09:23,334
And this enables us to use and style
153

153

00:09:23,334  -->  00:09:26,399
HTML5 elements in older browsers that were
154

154

00:09:26,399  -->  00:09:29,732
available before HTML5 actually existed.
155

155

00:09:31,507  -->  00:09:33,295
And this is pretty useful and we will include
156

156

00:09:33,295  -->  00:09:36,462
it just as we included respond before.
157

157

00:09:39,075  -->  00:09:40,158
So HTML5Shiv.
158

158

00:09:44,188  -->  00:09:47,438
So click this and then the min version
159

159

00:09:49,973  -->  00:09:51,890
and paste it down here.
160

160

00:09:53,606  -->  00:09:56,939
And the last one we will use selectivizr
161

161

00:09:58,504  -->  00:10:02,421
or something like that we'll just type it here.
162

162

00:10:06,269  -->  00:10:08,702
That's right so we will use this one.
163

163

00:10:08,702  -->  00:10:13,137
And this allows us to use CSS3 pseudo classes
164

164

00:10:13,137  -->  00:10:15,575
like less child and first child.
165

165

00:10:15,575  -->  00:10:18,325
Or Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8.
166

166

00:10:20,553  -->  00:10:24,720
So these are just some of the things that you can do.
167

167

00:10:25,801  -->  00:10:29,968
There are many more but these are some simple solutions.
168

168

00:10:34,578  -->  00:10:37,410
Now one very handy tool to see what exactly
169

169

00:10:37,410  -->  00:10:40,493
works on which browser is caniuse.com
170

170

00:10:42,008  -->  00:10:43,726
Which is this website.
171

171

00:10:43,726  -->  00:10:47,511
And in here we can just write CSS properties
172

172

00:10:47,511  -->  00:10:49,694
and I did this with transform.
173

173

00:10:49,694  -->  00:10:53,901
And it shows us exactly where this works.
174

174

00:10:53,901  -->  00:10:56,408
So we see that transform doesn't work
175

175

00:10:56,408  -->  00:11:00,575
in Internet Explorer 8 it works on 9 with the prefix ms.
176

176

00:11:02,526  -->  00:11:06,693
And for 10 and 11 it works just fine without any prefix.
177

177

00:11:10,224  -->  00:11:13,776
So for Google Chrome for instance version 31
178

178

00:11:13,776  -->  00:11:16,104
it needs the webkit but from then
179

179

00:11:16,104  -->  00:11:18,053
we don't need that anymore.
180

180

00:11:18,053  -->  00:11:20,303
Or for Safari for instance
181

181

00:11:21,319  -->  00:11:24,344
it also needs the webkit prefix
182

182

00:11:24,344  -->  00:11:26,811
or for the IOS Safari.
183

183

00:11:26,811  -->  00:11:31,185
And our bracket extensions already took care of that.
184

184

00:11:31,185  -->  00:11:34,918
So whenever we need to know if a CSS property
185

185

00:11:34,918  -->  00:11:37,667
works or not on a certain browser
186

186

00:11:37,667  -->  00:11:40,584
we can use this very handy website.
187

187

00:11:41,933  -->  00:11:45,165
So for me, this part is the most boring
188

188

00:11:45,165  -->  00:11:47,510
part of the web developer work.
189

189

00:11:47,510  -->  00:11:48,877
Working with all the browsers and
190

190

00:11:48,877  -->  00:11:51,352
looking what works and what doesn't.
191

191

00:11:51,352  -->  00:11:53,990
But well we still have to do it
192

192

00:11:53,990  -->  00:11:56,126
because it is super important that we
193

193

00:11:56,126  -->  00:12:00,293
make a website work on as many browsers as possible.
194

194

00:12:01,731  -->  00:12:04,757
So and with this lecture we close this section
195

195

00:12:04,757  -->  00:12:06,855
where we built the static part of our
196

196

00:12:06,855  -->  00:12:09,688
website project with HTML and CSS.
197

197

00:12:11,149  -->  00:12:13,149
And it is already great.
198

198

00:12:14,005  -->  00:12:15,955
Now if you were not able to follow
199

199

00:12:15,955  -->  00:12:18,161
all the lectures or did not understand
200

200

00:12:18,161  -->  00:12:20,158
everything, you can download all
201

201

00:12:20,158  -->  00:12:22,495
the codes for the entire project
202

202

00:12:22,495  -->  00:12:25,824
from the link in the description of this video.
203

203

00:12:25,824  -->  00:12:27,983
And as always please feel free to
204

204

00:12:27,983  -->  00:12:31,373
ask your questions in the course forms.
205

205

00:12:31,373  -->  00:12:33,509
And then when you're read join me in the
206

206

00:12:33,509  -->  00:12:35,676
next section about jQuery.
