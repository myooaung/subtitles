00:00:01.391  -->  00:00:02.656
<v Voiceover>Hi there.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.656  -->  00:00:05.741
Let's build the third section of our website,
3

3

00:00:05.741  -->  00:00:07.991
the favorite meals section.
4

4

00:00:09.152  -->  00:00:12.500
For this section, we will use beautiful photography
5

5

00:00:12.500  -->  00:00:14.368
and a nice transition effect
6

6

00:00:14.368  -->  00:00:18.346
to show the favorite meals of Omnifood's users.
7

7

00:00:18.346  -->  00:00:21.768
I planned the section, like you can see on that sketch
8

8

00:00:21.768  -->  00:00:23.749
that I did on the left side.
9

9

00:00:23.749  -->  00:00:27.740
And on the right side, we see how it will look like.
10

10

00:00:27.740  -->  00:00:30.263
Notice that this section has no title
11

11

00:00:30.263  -->  00:00:33.953
and uses 100% of the browser's width.
12

12

00:00:33.953  -->  00:00:35.786
So, no row class here.
13

13

00:00:37.040  -->  00:00:40.309
I choose this design so that those beautiful images
14

14

00:00:40.309  -->  00:00:42.059
have a bigger impact.
15

15

00:00:44.072  -->  00:00:45.745
In this lecture, you will learn
16

16

00:00:45.745  -->  00:00:48.564
how to make a grid of beautiful images
17

17

00:00:48.564  -->  00:00:51.383
and how to make a nice "zoom-in" transition
18

18

00:00:51.383  -->  00:00:52.633
just using CSS.
19

19

00:00:53.852  -->  00:00:56.769
This is really powerful CSS3 stuff.
20

20

00:00:57.856  -->  00:01:02.023
And we'll also learn a way to make &lt;img&gt; elements darker.
21

21

00:01:02.916  -->  00:01:05.249
It's all super easy and fun.
22

22

00:01:06.299  -->  00:01:08.466
So, back to our html file.
23

23

00:01:09.343  -->  00:01:12.510
Now, how are we gonna build this grid?
24

24

00:01:13.875  -->  00:01:17.542
First of all, we need to make a new section.
25

25

00:01:20.489  -->  00:01:21.489
So, section,
26

26

00:01:24.082  -->  00:01:26.955
and again I will call this "section,"
27

27

00:01:26.955  -->  00:01:29.288
and this time, it's "meals."
28

28

00:01:31.653  -->  00:01:33.403
Now, we want two rows
29

29

00:01:34.557  -->  00:01:36.974
with four images in each row.
30

30

00:01:37.835  -->  00:01:42.404
As I said before, we will not use the row class here
31

31

00:01:42.404  -->  00:01:45.284
because we don't want a centered row with some images.
32

32

00:01:45.284  -->  00:01:46.550
No, we want the images
33

33

00:01:46.550  -->  00:01:50.480
to occupy 100% of the browser's width.
34

34

00:01:50.480  -->  00:01:54.679
And it is actually a good practice to use an unordered list
35

35

00:01:54.679  -->  00:01:58.383
to do that; in fact, two unordered lists.
36

36

00:01:58.383  -->  00:02:00.883
We will use one for each line.
37

37

00:02:02.879  -->  00:02:04.970
Just as I did in the navigation,
38

38

00:02:04.970  -->  00:02:09.284
it's better to put some stuff in unordered lists;
39

39

00:02:09.284  -->  00:02:12.507
for example, those four links in the navigation,
40

40

00:02:12.507  -->  00:02:15.464
or these images that we're gonna use now,
41

41

00:02:15.464  -->  00:02:19.214
than just throw the images onto that website.
42

42

00:02:20.683  -->  00:02:24.246
So this is what we're gonna do now.
43

43

00:02:24.246  -->  00:02:28.413
&lt;ul&gt; class, and I will call this "meals-showcase".
44

44

00:02:33.325  -->  00:02:36.637
Alright, and, you remembered it:
45

45

00:02:36.637  -->  00:02:40.478
we will have that &lt;li&gt; element inside of that.
46

46

00:02:40.478  -->  00:02:43.935
Now, inside of this list we can put anything we want.
47

47

00:02:43.935  -->  00:02:46.035
In the navigation, we put links in here.
48

48

00:02:46.035  -->  00:02:50.202
Now we will see a new html element called &lt;figure&gt;.
49

49

00:02:53.048  -->  00:02:55.648
And &lt;figure&gt; is also like a container
50

50

00:02:55.648  -->  00:02:57.815
which can contain an image
51

51

00:02:58.784  -->  00:03:01.585
and also a caption for that image.
52

52

00:03:01.585  -->  00:03:03.411
In this case, we will only put
53

53

00:03:03.411  -->  00:03:07.728
an image inside of this container, and no caption.
54

54

00:03:07.728  -->  00:03:12.437
Because I don't wanna make things all too complicated here.
55

55

00:03:12.437  -->  00:03:14.270
But, just so you know,
56

56

00:03:15.999  -->  00:03:19.720
there is an element called &lt;figcaption&gt; and you can use that
57

57

00:03:19.720  -->  00:03:22.053
to put some caption in here.
58

58

00:03:24.926  -->  00:03:26.129
So, image.
59

59

00:03:26.129  -->  00:03:30.296
As you remember, we have to specify the source attribute.
60

60

00:03:31.510  -->  00:03:33.843
And now, where is our image?
61

61

00:03:34.810  -->  00:03:38.977
It is probably in /resources/img/
62

62

00:03:40.664  -->  00:03:44.884
and now let's better check what's inside of that folder
63

63

00:03:44.884  -->  00:03:46.801
so that we're completely sure.
64

64

00:03:46.801  -->  00:03:50.551
So, resources, img, and yeah, you'll see here
65

65

00:03:51.688  -->  00:03:53.587
these are our meals.
66

66

00:03:53.587  -->  00:03:57.985
So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
67

67

00:03:57.985  -->  00:04:00.652
This is the order of the images.
68

68

00:04:02.763  -->  00:04:05.346
And actually, in the text file,
69

69

00:04:06.997  -->  00:04:08.979
we have the name of the meals,
70

70

00:04:08.979  -->  00:04:10.146
and we can put
71

71

00:04:11.998  -->  00:04:12.915
those names
72

72

00:04:14.736  -->  00:04:17.736
in the alt description of the image.
73

73

00:04:19.511  -->  00:04:22.261
So here, we just want this image.
74

74

00:04:23.901  -->  00:04:26.984
Let me paste those names here, again,
75

75

00:04:28.239  -->  00:04:29.555
with a comment,
76

76

00:04:29.555  -->  00:04:31.472
as I showed you before,
77

77

00:04:32.502  -->  00:04:34.419
and close this comment.
78

78

00:04:37.683  -->  00:04:40.850
Okay, so this is the alternative text,
79

79

00:04:42.319  -->  00:04:44.182
as you already know, in case that the image
80

80

00:04:44.182  -->  00:04:46.911
cannot be displayed for some reason.
81

81

00:04:46.911  -->  00:04:48.078
And that's it.
82

82

00:04:49.811  -->  00:04:53.545
So I will copy this three more times,
83

83

00:04:53.545  -->  00:04:56.295
so that we have four images here.
84

84

00:04:58.055  -->  00:05:02.222
So this is number two, number three, and number four.
85

85

00:05:07.747  -->  00:05:10.247
And just copy these alt texts.
86

86

00:05:14.152  -->  00:05:16.069
"Chicken breast steak,"
87

87

00:05:20.337  -->  00:05:22.504
and "Autumn pumpkin soup."
88

88

00:05:23.944  -->  00:05:27.098
Wow, this sounds really good.
89

89

00:05:27.098  -->  00:05:30.336
Makes you feel hungry, right?
90

90

00:05:30.336  -->  00:05:33.336
Okay, this is the first four images.
91

91

00:05:35.161  -->  00:05:38.767
The first row of images, and now the second row.
92

92

00:05:38.767  -->  00:05:41.037
So, we will format all of this in a second
93

93

00:05:41.037  -->  00:05:42.704
in CSS, don't worry.
94

94

00:05:44.255  -->  00:05:48.172
And number six, number seven, and number eight.
95

95

00:05:51.867  -->  00:05:54.034
And now, the descriptions.
96

96

00:05:58.343  -->  00:06:01.093
So it's really important that you
97

97

00:06:02.167  -->  00:06:04.417
fill out this alt attribute
98

98

00:06:07.325  -->  00:06:10.742
in order to make your website valid html.
99

99

00:06:14.991  -->  00:06:17.824
We will see later in the course how we can check
100

100

00:06:17.824  -->  00:06:21.741
if we actually have valid or invalid html code.
101

101

00:06:22.822  -->  00:06:25.155
So this is really important.
102

102

00:06:26.430  -->  00:06:27.263
Alright.
103

103

00:06:32.305  -->  00:06:36.305
So, let's see what it looks like on our webpage.
104

104

00:06:40.230  -->  00:06:43.750
Of course, these images are so big,
105

105

00:06:43.750  -->  00:06:46.833
and look nothing like we want so far.
106

106

00:06:51.976  -->  00:06:55.643
But we're gonna fix that with CSS right now.
107

107

00:07:01.050  -->  00:07:04.883
So, remember, this is called "meals-showcase."
108

108

00:07:06.125  -->  00:07:08.394
I will just copy this
109

109

00:07:08.394  -->  00:07:11.478
so you don't have to write it all again.
110

110

00:07:11.478  -->  00:07:13.061
So, meals-showcase.
111

111

00:07:14.001  -->  00:07:15.663
We copy this.
112

112

00:07:15.663  -->  00:07:20.396
Again, I'm really worried about the structure here,
113

113

00:07:20.396  -->  00:07:22.063
so this is to Meals.
114

114

00:07:29.386  -->  00:07:31.969
As before, since this is a list
115

115

00:07:33.180  -->  00:07:36.172
and we don't want that bullet point,
116

116

00:07:36.172  -->  00:07:38.172
we say list-style: none;
117

117

00:07:40.331  -->  00:07:43.414
and another thing, since we want this
118

118

00:07:44.515  -->  00:07:47.098
to be the entire browser width,
119

119

00:07:48.358  -->  00:07:50.691
I will say width: 100%;
120

120

00:07:53.367  -->  00:07:56.536
So I hope you are already getting familiar with all of that
121

121

00:07:56.536  -->  00:08:00.997
and that you can follow exactly what I'm doing here.
122

122

00:08:00.997  -->  00:08:05.008
Now the next thing is to format the &lt;li&gt; elements
123

123

00:08:05.008  -->  00:08:07.425
inside of the unordered list.
124

124

00:08:09.043  -->  00:08:10.960
So, .meals-showcase li,
125

125

00:08:14.284  -->  00:08:15.867
as we already know.
126

126

00:08:18.627  -->  00:08:21.877
So, we want to display them as a block.
127

127

00:08:23.867  -->  00:08:27.283
So you see, this display property here
128

128

00:08:27.283  -->  00:08:29.488
is a really important one.
129

129

00:08:29.488  -->  00:08:32.716
I'm using it all the time, and you will, too,
130

130

00:08:32.716  -->  00:08:35.799
once you develop your first websites.
131

131

00:08:37.996  -->  00:08:41.496
And the next thing is that I want to float
132

132

00:08:42.972  -->  00:08:45.871
these elements to the left,
133

133

00:08:45.871  -->  00:08:49.135
so instead of showing one-after-one,
134

134

00:08:49.135  -->  00:08:51.218
I want them side-by-side.
135

135

00:08:53.411  -->  00:08:58.073
And another very important thing is their width.
136

136

00:08:58.073  -->  00:09:02.114
So, I'm having a list with 100% width
137

137

00:09:02.114  -->  00:09:05.364
and I want four elements inside of this
138

138

00:09:06.450  -->  00:09:09.618
to show side-by-side with the full width.
139

139

00:09:09.618  -->  00:09:13.264
So, I have four &lt;li&gt; elements, and therefore,
140

140

00:09:13.264  -->  00:09:16.931
each of them has to be 25% wide, right?
141

141

00:09:19.097  -->  00:09:22.597
Because four times 25 makes the 100%.
142

142

00:09:29.341  -->  00:09:32.341
Now, let me just do one thing, here,
143

143

00:09:36.476  -->  00:09:37.309
and let me
144

144

00:09:38.379  -->  00:09:40.753
give this &lt;figure&gt; element a class.
145

145

00:09:40.753  -->  00:09:43.253
I will call this "meal-photo."
146

146

00:09:48.639  -->  00:09:52.806
And I will do this with all of these eight figures.
147

147

00:09:57.283  -->  00:09:58.116
And
148

148

00:09:59.475  -->  00:10:01.308
one, two, three, four.
149

149

00:10:07.916  -->  00:10:11.333
What I want to do now is to format these.
150

150

00:10:12.843  -->  00:10:14.510
So, it's .meal-photo
151

151

00:10:20.700  -->  00:10:23.903
and what I gotta do now is to say this:
152

152

00:10:23.903  -->  00:10:25.320
width: 100%;
153

153

00:10:26.398  -->  00:10:30.281
Now, saying that this element with the class "meal-photo"
154

154

00:10:30.281  -->  00:10:33.392
has a width of 100%, means just
155

155

00:10:33.392  -->  00:10:37.256
that it has the exact width of its parent,
156

156

00:10:37.256  -->  00:10:39.589
which is .meals-showcase li.
157

157

00:10:41.674  -->  00:10:45.841
And we have also to say that it has a margin: zero.
158

158

00:10:47.336  -->  00:10:51.097
I know that we already did this in the beginning, here,
159

159

00:10:51.097  -->  00:10:53.267
so maybe what you are wondering,
160

160

00:10:53.267  -->  00:10:55.767
what is with the &lt;h1&gt; element?
161

161

00:10:57.461  -->  00:10:59.211
This "normalize" file
162

162

00:11:02.299  -->  00:11:05.299
defines some margin for that element
163

163

00:11:06.510  -->  00:11:10.440
and so we have to overwrite that specifically.
164

164

00:11:10.440  -->  00:11:14.023
And now, I need to format the actual photo,
165

165

00:11:15.531  -->  00:11:19.508
the actual image inside of the photo container.
166

166

00:11:19.508  -->  00:11:22.433
And the most important thing I have to do is,
167

167

00:11:22.433  -->  00:11:24.933
again, width equals 100%.
168

168

00:11:27.683  -->  00:11:31.452
And this will do exactly the same thing as before:
169

169

00:11:31.452  -->  00:11:33.304
it will assure that the image
170

170

00:11:33.304  -->  00:11:36.304
is exactly as wide as its container,
171

171

00:11:37.209  -->  00:11:39.042
which is this element.
172

172

00:11:39.905  -->  00:11:43.738
And the height will then be set automatically.
173

173

00:11:46.604  -->  00:11:48.854
So, what does it look like?
174

174

00:11:51.867  -->  00:11:56.338
Alright, this is exactly what we want, right?
175

175

00:11:56.338  -->  00:11:58.415
This looks great!
176

176

00:11:58.415  -->  00:12:00.570
The images are already here,
177

177

00:12:00.570  -->  00:12:02.671
but we're not quite done with this,
178

178

00:12:02.671  -->  00:12:06.232
because, as I said in the introduction of this lecture,
179

179

00:12:06.232  -->  00:12:09.381
We want to add some cool transitions here.
180

180

00:12:09.381  -->  00:12:11.064
And that's what we're gonna do
181

181

00:12:11.064  -->  00:12:14.940
in Part Two: Building the Meal Section.
182

182

00:12:14.940  -->  00:12:16.107
See you there!
