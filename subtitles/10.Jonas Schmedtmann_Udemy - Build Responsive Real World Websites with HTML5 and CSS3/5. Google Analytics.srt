<v ->(Voiceover) Welcome to our last lecture.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,970  -->  00:00:05,787 line:15% 
So now that our website is online,
3

3

00:00:05,787  -->  00:00:08,077 line:15% 
we can still work on it,
4

4

00:00:08,077  -->  00:00:10,347 line:15% 
because the launch is not the end of the story.
5

5

00:00:10,347  -->  00:00:12,847
So, as you hopefully remember,
6

6

00:00:13,752  -->  00:00:16,573
the seventh, and last step of our plan
7

7

00:00:16,573  -->  00:00:18,785
is the site maintenance.
8

8

00:00:18,785  -->  00:00:21,905
This means that you should keep track
9

9

00:00:21,905  -->  00:00:25,866
of your website's success and monitor users' behavior.
10

10

00:00:25,866  -->  00:00:27,783
And, how do we do that?
11

11

00:00:29,402  -->  00:00:32,713
We use a very powerful tool called Google Analytics.
12

12

00:00:32,713  -->  00:00:36,541
With this software, you'll be able to monitor statistics,
13

13

00:00:36,541  -->  00:00:39,159
like the number of visits your website receives,
14

14

00:00:39,159  -->  00:00:41,901
the amount of time your visitors stay,
15

15

00:00:41,901  -->  00:00:45,505
the average number of page views for each visitor,
16

16

00:00:45,505  -->  00:00:49,337
and many many other useful statistics.
17

17

00:00:49,337  -->  00:00:53,409
And then, using this data, you can make adjustments
18

18

00:00:53,409  -->  00:00:57,576
to the website in order to make it better and better.
19

19

00:00:59,539  -->  00:01:02,043
So I will now actually install Google Analytics
20

20

00:01:02,043  -->  00:01:04,501
on the website I just uploaded
21

21

00:01:04,501  -->  00:01:06,918
to show you how easy that is.
22

22

00:01:08,243  -->  00:01:11,221
So, of course, you need to start off
23

23

00:01:11,221  -->  00:01:13,896
by creating an account for Google Analytics,
24

24

00:01:13,896  -->  00:01:18,138
but that's easy if you already have a Google account.
25

25

00:01:18,138  -->  00:01:22,082
And once you have your Google Analytics account created,
26

26

00:01:22,082  -->  00:01:23,915
this is what comes up.
27

27

00:01:24,850  -->  00:01:29,017
So we now need to add a new website that we will track.
28

28

00:01:30,072  -->  00:01:32,822
So in my case, so it's a website,
29

29

00:01:33,768  -->  00:01:37,101
for this case, I will call it Omnifirst,
30

30

00:01:38,449  -->  00:01:41,616
and then we need to link to a website.
31

31

00:01:43,402  -->  00:01:45,735
And I can copy it from here,
32

32

00:01:48,296  -->  00:01:50,129
and now some industry,
33

33

00:01:51,562  -->  00:01:53,566
well this doesn't really matter, right?
34

34

00:01:53,566  -->  00:01:57,278
I will say "computers" because we created it
35

35

00:01:57,278  -->  00:02:00,477
in a web design course, and then the zone
36

36

00:02:00,477  -->  00:02:03,001
I'll want is for Portugal actually.
37

37

00:02:03,001  -->  00:02:05,001
That's where I live, so.
38

38

00:02:05,843  -->  00:02:09,093
And now we just hit guest checking I.D.
39

39

00:02:14,546  -->  00:02:16,637
So now, all we need to do really
40

40

00:02:16,637  -->  00:02:20,804
is to copy this script here and edit to our website.
41

41

00:02:25,100  -->  00:02:29,267
First simple piece of Java script, so it goes down here.
42

42

00:02:31,436  -->  00:02:33,519
And we just paste it here
43

43

00:02:36,608  -->  00:02:39,938
and we don't have to do anything else.
44

44

00:02:39,938  -->  00:02:42,014
Now if you have a website with multiple pages,
45

45

00:02:42,014  -->  00:02:44,829
then you need to past this script
46

46

00:02:44,829  -->  00:02:47,329
in each of those pages, right?
47

47

00:02:48,777  -->  00:02:53,299
Okay, now I take this and I actually will also upload this,
48

48

00:02:53,299  -->  00:02:56,848
so this is what I showed you in the lecture before,
49

49

00:02:56,848  -->  00:02:58,319
and as I told you,
50

50

00:02:58,319  -->  00:03:02,751
this will only upload the files that were changed.
51

51

00:03:02,751  -->  00:03:06,465
So it now checks all the files, but it doesn't upload them.
52

52

00:03:06,465  -->  00:03:10,048
It will only upload [Inaudible] HTML files.
53

53

00:03:15,559  -->  00:03:16,392
All right.
54

54

00:03:18,594  -->  00:03:21,966
Let me just check if this worked,
55

55

00:03:21,966  -->  00:03:24,466
so I will see the page source.
56

56

00:03:26,196  -->  00:03:29,101
And down here is the code
57

57

00:03:29,101  -->  00:03:32,434
that we just placed it there, all right?
58

58

00:03:34,549  -->  00:03:37,632
This is exactly what we wanted to do.
59

59

00:03:41,425  -->  00:03:43,675
Okay, then you can actually
60

60

00:03:46,483  -->  00:03:48,333
visit your statistics.
61

61

00:03:48,333  -->  00:03:49,473
So this is what I told you.
62

62

00:03:49,473  -->  00:03:53,347
You can see all kind of statistics here.
63

63

00:03:53,347  -->  00:03:55,930
So just go explore all of this.
64

64

00:04:00,094  -->  00:04:02,564
So the number of sessions, the number of users,
65

65

00:04:02,564  -->  00:04:05,617
the number of page views, the number of pages per session,
66

66

00:04:05,617  -->  00:04:08,108
and then how many times the user stayed on the web page,
67

67

00:04:08,108  -->  00:04:09,439
and the bounce rate,
68

68

00:04:09,439  -->  00:04:13,229
which is the amount of single page users,
69

69

00:04:13,229  -->  00:04:15,771
which in our case, of course, will be quite high
70

70

00:04:15,771  -->  00:04:18,271
because we only have one page.
71

71

00:04:19,289  -->  00:04:22,312
But you know, all kinds of statistics are here
72

72

00:04:22,312  -->  00:04:24,421
and down here are even more, where we can see
73

73

00:04:24,421  -->  00:04:26,843
where your visitors came from,
74

74

00:04:26,843  -->  00:04:29,988
where if they came from Facebook,
75

75

00:04:29,988  -->  00:04:34,155
or you can even see which country they came from here,
76

76

00:04:36,778  -->  00:04:38,695
and all kinds of stuff.
77

77

00:04:40,376  -->  00:04:43,002
So again, this is a really powerful tool
78

78

00:04:43,002  -->  00:04:47,625
and you should definitely take the most out of it.
79

79

00:04:47,625  -->  00:04:50,514
This is, of course, all empty by now,
80

80

00:04:50,514  -->  00:04:53,597
because I just created a few seconds ago.
81

81

00:04:53,597  -->  00:04:57,764
So, this was a quick introduction to Google analytics
82

82

00:04:59,243  -->  00:05:00,993
and how to set it up.
83

83

00:05:02,652  -->  00:05:05,722
So, now we have put all the seven steps
84

84

00:05:05,722  -->  00:05:07,848
from our seven step plan into action.
85

85

00:05:07,848  -->  00:05:11,598
This was quite a long journey, but we did it!
86

86

00:05:12,641  -->  00:05:15,719
You can now actually open the web page on the internet,
87

87

00:05:15,719  -->  00:05:19,420
It is exactly the website that we created together.
88

88

00:05:19,420  -->  00:05:21,647
And you are now able to do all of this
89

89

00:05:21,647  -->  00:05:23,259
completely on your own.
90

90

00:05:23,259  -->  00:05:25,210
And that is so amazing.
91

91

00:05:25,210  -->  00:05:29,833
I mean, what could even be more powerful, right?
92

92

00:05:29,833  -->  00:05:32,623
But now, stay tuned for one more lecture
93

93

00:05:32,623  -->  00:05:35,043
where I have some additional information
94

94

00:05:35,043  -->  00:05:37,569
that you don't want to miss.
95

95

00:05:37,569  -->  00:05:40,236
So, see you in the next lecture.
