00:00:01,280  -->  00:00:05,854
<v Voiceover>Welcome to the first lecture about web design.</v>
2

2

00:00:05,854  -->  00:00:09,848
I hope you already downloaded your copy of the course ebook.
3

3

00:00:09,848  -->  00:00:13,006
If you didn't, you should do that right now.
4

4

00:00:13,006  -->  00:00:15,444
It is in the previous lecture.
5

5

00:00:15,444  -->  00:00:18,741
So besides all the things you will learn in the course,
6

6

00:00:18,741  -->  00:00:22,340
I also share a lot of resources with you in the course ebook
7

7

00:00:22,340  -->  00:00:25,986
as we go over the different topics of this course.
8

8

00:00:25,986  -->  00:00:29,771
This will make your life as a web designer a lot easier.
9

9

00:00:29,771  -->  00:00:32,975
This ebook actually contains material that is not covered in
10

10

00:00:32,975  -->  00:00:35,831
this course, but in my other course,
11

11

00:00:35,831  -->  00:00:39,221
which is about web design and web development.
12

12

00:00:39,221  -->  00:00:42,554
So take a look at that material as well.
13

13

00:00:44,097  -->  00:00:46,977
Now before we start, let's first distinguish
14

14

00:00:46,977  -->  00:00:50,018
between web designer and web developer.
15

15

00:00:50,018  -->  00:00:51,505
The designer is the one who creates
16

16

00:00:51,505  -->  00:00:54,221
the look and feel of the web site.
17

17

00:00:54,221  -->  00:00:57,867
The developer then actually builds a web site based
18

18

00:00:57,867  -->  00:01:00,653
on the design from the designer.
19

19

00:01:00,653  -->  00:01:02,975
A front-end developer uses languages
20

20

00:01:02,975  -->  00:01:06,017
such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
21

21

00:01:06,017  -->  00:01:07,875
for the front-end which is
22

22

00:01:07,875  -->  00:01:11,056
the visible part of the web sites.
23

23

00:01:11,056  -->  00:01:13,703
Now the lines between designers and developers
24

24

00:01:13,703  -->  00:01:16,480
are becoming more blurred as learning to code
25

25

00:01:16,480  -->  00:01:18,593
is getting easier for designers
26

26

00:01:18,593  -->  00:01:22,470
and designing is getting easier to developers.
27

27

00:01:22,470  -->  00:01:25,884
So if you're already familiar with HTML and CSS,
28

28

00:01:25,884  -->  00:01:29,297
or Photoshop or some other graphical software,
29

29

00:01:29,297  -->  00:01:31,805
you can take the guidelines and rules you will learn
30

30

00:01:31,805  -->  00:01:34,521
in this course, and start using them today
31

31

00:01:34,521  -->  00:01:37,726
to design beautiful web sites.
32

32

00:01:37,726  -->  00:01:41,464
Now there's actually a good reason why it's getting easier
33

33

00:01:41,464  -->  00:01:43,693
to get started with web design.
34

34

00:01:43,693  -->  00:01:46,271
And I'm talking about flat design, which is
35

35

00:01:46,271  -->  00:01:49,243
the big, new design trend popularized
36

36

00:01:49,243  -->  00:01:51,160
by Microsoft and Apple.
37

37

00:01:52,215  -->  00:01:55,141
The introduction of flat design completely changed
38

38

00:01:55,141  -->  00:01:57,834
the way we design today.
39

39

00:01:57,834  -->  00:02:01,758
I will explain this based here on Apple's iOS
40

40

00:02:01,758  -->  00:02:04,289
that we can see here in this picture.
41

41

00:02:04,289  -->  00:02:07,215
So on the left side, you have the old iOS6,
42

42

00:02:07,215  -->  00:02:08,496
with all those shadows,
43

43

00:02:08,496  -->  00:02:12,385
color gradients, textures, and bubbles.
44

44

00:02:12,385  -->  00:02:16,147
On the right side, the new iOS7 look and feel.
45

45

00:02:16,147  -->  00:02:18,376
Now flat design gets rid of all
46

46

00:02:18,376  -->  00:02:21,720
those shadows, color gradients, textures,
47

47

00:02:21,720  -->  00:02:24,971
and so on, leaving us with a two-dimensional design
48

48

00:02:24,971  -->  00:02:28,245
without losing their functionality.
49

49

00:02:28,245  -->  00:02:30,451
Most people perceive flat design
50

50

00:02:30,451  -->  00:02:33,887
as being simple, clean, and modern.
51

51

00:02:33,887  -->  00:02:35,815
I personally think that interface on
52

52

00:02:35,815  -->  00:02:38,462
the right side looks really much cleaner
53

53

00:02:38,462  -->  00:02:40,545
and more elegant as well.
54

54

00:02:42,688  -->  00:02:45,822
Or maybe look at these two login forms.
55

55

00:02:45,822  -->  00:02:47,401
I mean, would you find it easier
56

56

00:02:47,401  -->  00:02:50,606
to design the left or the right interface?
57

57

00:02:50,606  -->  00:02:52,533
And that's what I'm talking about.
58

58

00:02:52,533  -->  00:02:54,553
So this is a huge opportunity
59

59

00:02:54,553  -->  00:02:57,220
for new designers just like you.
60

60

00:02:58,849  -->  00:03:02,378
Or look at these beautiful flat web designs.
61

61

00:03:02,378  -->  00:03:03,702
Now I'm not saying that it's easy
62

62

00:03:03,702  -->  00:03:07,510
to design these sites because it really is not.
63

63

00:03:07,510  -->  00:03:10,226
But for a complete beginner, I think it's easier
64

64

00:03:10,226  -->  00:03:12,864
to get started with this type of design
65

65

00:03:12,864  -->  00:03:16,231
because it's technically easier to do.
66

66

00:03:16,231  -->  00:03:17,926
You will see lots of web sites
67

67

00:03:17,926  -->  00:03:21,548
like these over the next lectures.
68

68

00:03:21,548  -->  00:03:25,403
So that's it about the introduction to web design.
69

69

00:03:25,403  -->  00:03:27,911
I think it's very important that you start to get a feeling
70

70

00:03:27,911  -->  00:03:32,369
for what's happening in the world of web design right now.
71

71

00:03:32,369  -->  00:03:35,318
So that's why I gave you this short introduction.
72

72

00:03:35,318  -->  00:03:36,827
And now we will start learning
73

73

00:03:36,827  -->  00:03:39,312
some guidelines about typography.
74

74

00:03:39,312  -->  00:03:41,812
Make sure you don't miss them.
