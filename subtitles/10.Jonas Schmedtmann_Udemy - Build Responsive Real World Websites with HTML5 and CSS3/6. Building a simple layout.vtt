00:00:01.552  -->  00:00:04.175
<v Voiceover>Hello. Excited for a new lesson?</v>
2

2

00:00:04.175  -->  00:00:06.859
I hope so because this is going
3

3

00:00:06.859  -->  00:00:08.276
to be a long one.
4

4

00:00:09.558  -->  00:00:11.928
Now that we know how the box model works,
5

5

00:00:11.928  -->  00:00:13.676
let's build a simple layout for
6

6

00:00:13.676  -->  00:00:15.524
our blog page.
7

7

00:00:15.524  -->  00:00:18.438
This is where all the fun begins.
8

8

00:00:18.438  -->  00:00:21.438
We want a layout just like this one.
9

9

00:00:22.546  -->  00:00:25.322
So we want a box with our main content,
10

10

00:00:25.322  -->  00:00:27.792
the box for the author info and the
11

11

00:00:27.792  -->  00:00:30.041
box to show what other blog posts
12

12

00:00:30.041  -->  00:00:31.374
are on our blog.
13

13

00:00:32.654  -->  00:00:34.266
We will start by putting all the
14

14

00:00:34.266  -->  00:00:37.622
content we have so far inside a container
15

15

00:00:37.622  -->  00:00:40.502
and center that container on the web page
16

16

00:00:40.502  -->  00:00:44.688
like most of the websites you use every day do.
17

17

00:00:44.688  -->  00:00:48.134
We will do that by using the div element,
18

18

00:00:48.134  -->  00:00:50.768
which we have not talked about yet.
19

19

00:00:50.768  -->  00:00:53.943
The div element is one of the most used elements.
20

20

00:00:53.943  -->  00:00:56.671
Div stands for divide, and so we use it simply
21

21

00:00:56.671  -->  00:01:00.085
to divide our page into sections by creating
22

22

00:01:00.085  -->  00:01:03.002
boxes where we put our contents in.
23

23

00:01:04.918  -->  00:01:06.847
So let's wrap all the content we have
24

24

00:01:06.847  -->  00:01:09.180
so far inside a div element.
25

25

00:01:13.566  -->  00:01:15.233
Starting right here.
26

26

00:01:17.135  -->  00:01:18.385
Just write div.
27

27

00:01:22.583  -->  00:01:25.583
Some space and I'll copy everything,
28

28

00:01:28.398  -->  00:01:31.446
all the content we have so far,
29

29

00:01:31.446  -->  00:01:34.613
I will cut it and paste it right here.
30

30

00:01:41.799  -->  00:01:44.527
Now I need to indent this code by
31

31

00:01:44.527  -->  00:01:46.027
using the tab key.
32

32

00:01:49.615  -->  00:01:51.948
I will show you in a second.
33

33

00:01:52.942  -->  00:01:55.859
So that the code looks much better.
34

34

00:01:58.150  -->  00:02:00.350
And it's easier to read with these indents.
35

35

00:02:00.350  -->  00:02:05.033
Html is the first level, that is the second level,
36

36

00:02:05.033  -->  00:02:07.046
that's the third level, and everything
37

37

00:02:07.046  -->  00:02:10.213
inside of the div is the fourth level.
38

38

00:02:12.494  -->  00:02:16.381
And then third level, second level, first level.
39

39

00:02:16.381  -->  00:02:19.464
So now let's call this div container.
40

40

00:02:22.642  -->  00:02:24.392
So call it container.
41

41

00:02:26.334  -->  00:02:28.478
And like I showed you before, we will
42

42

00:02:28.478  -->  00:02:31.646
use Command E, this time with the cursor
43

43

00:02:31.646  -->  00:02:33.229
on this class name.
44

44

00:02:34.815  -->  00:02:36.542
Command E and then we will make
45

45

00:02:36.542  -->  00:02:39.190
a new rule for this class.
46

46

00:02:39.190  -->  00:02:42.079
So the class selector and the
47

47

00:02:42.079  -->  00:02:43.654
name of the class container
48

48

00:02:43.654  -->  00:02:45.867
and now we can write our styles
49

49

00:02:45.867  -->  00:02:47.117
for this class.
50

50

00:02:48.898  -->  00:02:51.398
First, I will define the width
51

51

00:02:53.740  -->  00:02:56.573
of this and I will use 1140 pixels
52

52

00:02:59.142  -->  00:03:00.225
as the width.
53

53

00:03:02.510  -->  00:03:05.747
The standard width has been 960 pixels
54

54

00:03:05.747  -->  00:03:08.184
for a long time but as screens start
55

55

00:03:08.184  -->  00:03:10.143
getting larger and larger,
56

56

00:03:10.143  -->  00:03:12.893
we can also make wider web pages.
57

57

00:03:14.382  -->  00:03:17.715
So let me just make these windows bigger
58

58

00:03:20.590  -->  00:03:23.590
so we can see what's happening here.
59

59

00:03:24.718  -->  00:03:28.087
Now, we want this container to be centered
60

60

00:03:28.087  -->  00:03:31.670
in the window, not all the way to the left.
61

61

00:03:33.175  -->  00:03:36.817
So let's go back to brackets to do that.
62

62

00:03:36.817  -->  00:03:40.045
And it's actually easier than it sounds.
63

63

00:03:40.045  -->  00:03:42.077
In order to do that, we have to define
64

64

00:03:42.077  -->  00:03:45.244
left and right margin of the container
65

65

00:03:46.330  -->  00:03:47.247
to be auto.
66

66

00:03:52.305  -->  00:03:55.805
Margin left, auto, and margin right, auto.
67

67

00:04:00.433  -->  00:04:03.505
And the auto means that the left
68

68

00:04:03.505  -->  00:04:07.196
and right margin are adjusted automatically
69

69

00:04:07.196  -->  00:04:09.602
according to the context of the element,
70

70

00:04:09.602  -->  00:04:13.019
which is the browser window in this case.
71

71

00:04:14.971  -->  00:04:17.244
So let's see what happened.
72

72

00:04:17.244  -->  00:04:21.230
So, like magic, the website is centered.
73

73

00:04:21.230  -->  00:04:25.187
But even if I adjust the browser window,
74

74

00:04:25.187  -->  00:04:28.770
our content always stays centered, you see?
75

75

00:04:32.200  -->  00:04:36.033
Now let's go back and create those three boxes
76

76

00:04:37.459  -->  00:04:39.126
that we saw earlier.
77

77

00:04:39.962  -->  00:04:43.379
Again, we use the div element to do that.
78

78

00:04:47.273  -->  00:04:51.190
Div, and I will call the first one "blog post".
79

79

00:04:58.362  -->  00:05:01.529
So instead of copying all the content,
80

80

00:05:02.373  -->  00:05:05.659
I'll just delete this closing tag
81

81

00:05:05.659  -->  00:05:08.492
and put it where we want it to be.
82

82

00:05:09.947  -->  00:05:12.280
And it's down here, you see?
83

83

00:05:16.395  -->  00:05:19.585
Because here is the part where the author begins
84

84

00:05:19.585  -->  00:05:23.002
and everything above it is the blog post.
85

85

00:05:26.834  -->  00:05:30.152
And brackets automatically close that for us.
86

86

00:05:30.152  -->  00:05:32.902
Now again, let's indent this code
87

87

00:05:34.029  -->  00:05:36.230
so it's easier to read.
88

88

00:05:36.230  -->  00:05:37.480
Just like this.
89

89

00:05:38.866  -->  00:05:41.996
Now, below this, I'll create the container
90

90

00:05:41.996  -->  00:05:44.603
for the other blog post which will
91

91

00:05:44.603  -->  00:05:47.747
be the green blog post, if you remember it.
92

92

00:05:47.747  -->  00:05:49.997
So div, class, other posts.
93

93

00:05:52.760  -->  00:05:55.251
That's a great name for this, I think.
94

94

00:05:55.251  -->  00:05:59.963
And I'll just put some dummy text here for now.
95

95

00:05:59.963  -->  00:06:02.963
And finally, the box for the author.
96

96

00:06:04.498  -->  00:06:06.665
We have class, author box.
97

97

00:06:11.340  -->  00:06:13.090
We'll move this here.
98

98

00:06:16.488  -->  00:06:18.238
Now, indent and code.
99

99

00:06:20.524  -->  00:06:23.357
And save it, never forget to save.
100

100

00:06:24.250  -->  00:06:26.874
So let's just give them different
101

101

00:06:26.874  -->  00:06:28.707
background colors so we can see
102

102

00:06:28.707  -->  00:06:31.374
on the web page what's going on.
103

103

00:06:32.443  -->  00:06:34.441
Again, I will hit command E because
104

104

00:06:34.441  -->  00:06:37.398
it's the easiest way instead of switching
105

105

00:06:37.398  -->  00:06:40.898
back and forth between HTML and CSS files.
106

106

00:06:43.483  -->  00:06:47.019
So in order to specify a background color,
107

107

00:06:47.019  -->  00:06:50.731
it's very easy, just write background color
108

108

00:06:50.731  -->  00:06:52.648
and then chose a color.
109

109

00:06:53.914  -->  00:06:57.164
If you remember from our color lecture,
110

110

00:07:00.819  -->  00:07:03.902
blue is...red 0, green 0 and blue ff.
111

111

00:07:10.971  -->  00:07:13.888
Okay, let's close this post and now
112

112

00:07:14.956  -->  00:07:18.123
the other posts. For this one and now,
113

113

00:07:20.446  -->  00:07:22.446
again, background color.
114

114

00:07:26.245  -->  00:07:28.912
This one is green so, it will be
115

115

00:07:31.590  -->  00:07:34.840
0 for red, ff for green and 0 for blue.
116

116

00:07:36.964  -->  00:07:38.411
If you put this cursor on this color
117

117

00:07:38.411  -->  00:07:41.380
we can actually see it. Yeah, it's
118

118

00:07:41.380  -->  00:07:42.963
green as we wanted.
119

119

00:07:43.933  -->  00:07:45.780
And now the author box, we must
120

120

00:07:45.780  -->  00:07:47.947
find a style for this one.
121

121

00:07:50.319  -->  00:07:53.319
Background color, we want it yellow.
122

122

00:07:55.580  -->  00:07:59.580
So it's ff for red, ff for green and 0 for blue.
123

123

00:08:06.572  -->  00:08:07.489
So, yellow.
124

124

00:08:09.667  -->  00:08:12.151
We'll close these ones and let's check
125

125

00:08:12.151  -->  00:08:13.734
our web page again.
126

126

00:08:16.116  -->  00:08:18.172
So blue is the first box, green is
127

127

00:08:18.172  -->  00:08:21.755
the second box and yellow is the third box.
128

128

00:08:23.180  -->  00:08:26.420
Now, I want the width of the actual blog post
129

129

00:08:26.420  -->  00:08:29.683
to be 75 percent of the container and the
130

130

00:08:29.683  -->  00:08:33.085
other blog posts sectioned to be 25 percent.
131

131

00:08:33.085  -->  00:08:34.835
And that's very easy.
132

132

00:08:37.891  -->  00:08:41.058
So the blog posts, we just need to say
133

133

00:08:42.176  -->  00:08:45.259
width 75 percent, and the other posts
134

134

00:08:48.892  -->  00:08:51.309
Command E, width, 25 percent.
135

135

00:08:56.627  -->  00:09:00.164
So you see, we can not use only pixels
136

136

00:09:00.164  -->  00:09:03.723
to define measures but also percentages
137

137

00:09:03.723  -->  00:09:06.890
which will become very handy later on.
138

138

00:09:09.915  -->  00:09:14.312
Now it's 75 percent and that's just 25 percent
139

139

00:09:14.312  -->  00:09:16.499
here in the green box.
140

140

00:09:16.499  -->  00:09:18.631
Now, to put the green box beside the blue box,
141

141

00:09:18.631  -->  00:09:21.940
as we want it for our layout, we need to use
142

142

00:09:21.940  -->  00:09:25.001
a new property called float.
143

143

00:09:25.001  -->  00:09:27.904
And this is very important.
144

144

00:09:27.904  -->  00:09:30.252
With float, an element can be pushed
145

145

00:09:30.252  -->  00:09:32.347
to the left or to the right, allowing
146

146

00:09:32.347  -->  00:09:35.097
other elements to wrap around it.
147

147

00:09:36.843  -->  00:09:38.563
So if we define a float property
148

148

00:09:38.563  -->  00:09:41.913
for the blue and for the green box as left,
149

149

00:09:41.913  -->  00:09:45.162
the two boxes will be side by side.
150

150

00:09:45.162  -->  00:09:46.579
So let's do that.
151

151

00:09:47.683  -->  00:09:49.516
We'll start down here.
152

152

00:09:52.270  -->  00:09:53.270
Float, left.
153

153

00:09:55.158  -->  00:09:56.991
And the blue box also.
154

154

00:10:00.355  -->  00:10:01.355
Float, left.
155

155

00:10:03.971  -->  00:10:06.804
So let's see what this looks like.
156

156

00:10:09.579  -->  00:10:13.022
Great, these two boxes are side by side now.
157

157

00:10:13.022  -->  00:10:15.935
Now the problem is the yellow box is
158

158

00:10:15.935  -->  00:10:18.935
also up here where we don't want it.
159

159

00:10:20.453  -->  00:10:24.220
To avoid this, we have to use a clear property
160

160

00:10:24.220  -->  00:10:27.851
which is like the counterpart to float.
161

161

00:10:27.851  -->  00:10:32.018
I am actually going to do this in a very specific way.
162

162

00:10:33.550  -->  00:10:36.217
So please just copy the CSS code
163

163

00:10:37.972  -->  00:10:39.844
that I'm going to write here because
164

164

00:10:39.844  -->  00:10:41.524
it's not important that you understand
165

165

00:10:41.524  -->  00:10:43.387
it at this point.
166

166

00:10:43.387  -->  00:10:46.554
I'll use a very usual clear fix class.
167

167

00:10:48.867  -->  00:10:50.950
So write clear fix after.
168

168

00:10:52.859  -->  00:10:54.593
Again, it's not important that you understand
169

169

00:10:54.593  -->  00:10:57.260
what I'm writing here right now.
170

170

00:11:01.011  -->  00:11:04.511
We'll just use this class and clear. Save.
171

171

00:11:12.822  -->  00:11:15.338
So after the green box, let's just add
172

172

00:11:15.338  -->  00:11:18.338
an empty div with a clear fix class.
173

173

00:11:21.814  -->  00:11:25.320
This may look a little strange to you now
174

174

00:11:25.320  -->  00:11:26.653
but don't worry.
175

175

00:11:30.660  -->  00:11:33.493
We will see how to use this later.
176

176

00:11:34.461  -->  00:11:35.294
Clear fix.
177

177

00:11:37.614  -->  00:11:39.614
Okay now it should work.
178

178

00:11:42.403  -->  00:11:43.736
Yeah, that's it.
179

179

00:11:45.516  -->  00:11:49.318
Now, we see that the yellow class is down here
180

180

00:11:49.318  -->  00:11:51.587
as we want it so we have these
181

181

00:11:51.587  -->  00:11:54.365
two boxes side by side with the
182

182

00:11:54.365  -->  00:11:56.274
float property, then we use the
183

183

00:11:56.274  -->  00:12:00.024
clear property in the strange clear fix class
184

184

00:12:01.320  -->  00:12:05.035
to clear the float so that this box
185

185

00:12:05.035  -->  00:12:07.952
can be right under these two boxes.
186

186

00:12:09.027  -->  00:12:12.860
Now, let's just add some margins and paddings.
187

187

00:12:14.125  -->  00:12:16.980
You see, the blue box and the green box here
188

188

00:12:16.980  -->  00:12:19.589
are way too close together so we
189

189

00:12:19.589  -->  00:12:22.256
can add paddings to those boxes.
190

190

00:12:25.659  -->  00:12:27.779
And I will just go back and
191

191

00:12:27.779  -->  00:12:31.196
I will actually use a CSS file here again
192

192

00:12:32.420  -->  00:12:36.350
so you can see all those class we created
193

193

00:12:36.350  -->  00:12:38.100
inside the html file.
194

194

00:12:42.002  -->  00:12:44.891
Brackets put those down here at the
195

195

00:12:44.891  -->  00:12:46.891
end of the CSS document.
196

196

00:12:48.115  -->  00:12:49.442
The container, the blog posts,
197

197

00:12:49.442  -->  00:12:52.359
the other posts and the author box.
198

198

00:12:53.651  -->  00:12:55.651
Now let's just add the padding
199

199

00:12:55.651  -->  00:12:58.716
to the right side of the blog post.
200

200

00:12:58.716  -->  00:13:01.290
If you remember padding, just like
201

201

00:13:01.290  -->  00:13:03.623
a wide space inside the box.
202

202

00:13:05.483  -->  00:13:08.066
We will just say padding right,
203

203

00:13:10.099  -->  00:13:11.599
and say 30 pixels.
204

204

00:13:13.252  -->  00:13:15.342
Okay, let's see.
205

205

00:13:15.342  -->  00:13:18.278
You'll see this space here, but still
206

206

00:13:18.278  -->  00:13:21.111
inside the box so it's still blue.
207

207

00:13:22.023  -->  00:13:25.684
And that will give us a nice space
208

208

00:13:25.684  -->  00:13:27.684
between those two boxes.
209

209

00:13:29.011  -->  00:13:31.458
Now we should also put a little margin
210

210

00:13:31.458  -->  00:13:33.363
between the top of the container
211

211

00:13:33.363  -->  00:13:35.570
and the browser window.
212

212

00:13:35.570  -->  00:13:38.331
So to give it a nice spacing between
213

213

00:13:38.331  -->  00:13:41.772
the beginning of the browser window here
214

214

00:13:41.772  -->  00:13:44.522
and the beginning of the content.
215

215

00:13:46.796  -->  00:13:50.451
And that's easy, the easiest way may be
216

216

00:13:50.451  -->  00:13:52.534
in the container element.
217

217

00:13:53.800  -->  00:13:56.883
If we set margin top of the container
218

218

00:13:59.450  -->  00:14:01.367
to let's say 20 pixels.
219

219

00:14:03.783  -->  00:14:06.366
Then, we have this nice spacing
220

220

00:14:09.197  -->  00:14:11.498
all the way up here.
221

221

00:14:11.498  -->  00:14:14.364
Okay, now let's just get rid of those
222

222

00:14:14.364  -->  00:14:16.281
ugly background colors.
223

223

00:14:19.228  -->  00:14:23.277
We just use them so we could see the boxes
224

224

00:14:23.277  -->  00:14:25.777
while we were working on them.
225

225

00:14:28.467  -->  00:14:31.659
Now, maybe see here in the container
226

226

00:14:31.659  -->  00:14:35.576
declaration block that we have these 3 margins.
227

227

00:14:36.490  -->  00:14:39.739
Margin left, margin right and margin top.
228

228

00:14:39.739  -->  00:14:43.227
There's actually a cleaner way of doing this.
229

229

00:14:43.227  -->  00:14:45.144
I'll just show you how.
230

230

00:14:46.116  -->  00:14:50.162
You can just write margin, then we specify
231

231

00:14:50.162  -->  00:14:52.495
the four possible margins in
232

232

00:14:53.994  -->  00:14:55.994
this shorthand property.
233

233

00:14:57.820  -->  00:15:01.320
So this goes like the top margin is first,
234

234

00:15:02.955  -->  00:15:05.335
we'll just write it here so you can see it,
235

235

00:15:05.335  -->  00:15:09.001
it's top is the first, then the right,
236

236

00:15:09.001  -->  00:15:11.251
then bottom, and then left.
237

237

00:15:16.203  -->  00:15:20.370
So the top button, we want to be 20 pixels, right?
238

238

00:15:21.346  -->  00:15:24.513
And the right is auto, the bottom is 0
239

239

00:15:27.163  -->  00:15:29.497
because we don't have any margin at the bottom,
240

240

00:15:29.497  -->  00:15:31.414
and left is auto again.
241

241

00:15:35.374  -->  00:15:38.291
So this short declaration here does
242

242

00:15:39.643  -->  00:15:42.060
the exact same thing as this.
243

243

00:15:43.123  -->  00:15:47.290
Just remember it's margin top, right, bottom and left.
244

244

00:15:50.621  -->  00:15:53.427
So I can just delete it and things look
245

245

00:15:53.427  -->  00:15:54.844
exactly the same.
246

246

00:15:56.570  -->  00:15:59.810
All the margins are still there and as you see,
247

247

00:15:59.810  -->  00:16:03.227
the ugly background colors are also gone.
248

248

00:16:04.931  -->  00:16:08.264
Another cool thing we can do is add like
249

249

00:16:09.364  -->  00:16:12.947
a gray line here to separate the author box
250

250

00:16:14.267  -->  00:16:16.767
from the two boxes above them.
251

251

00:16:18.507  -->  00:16:21.340
So let's go back to the author box
252

252

00:16:22.479  -->  00:16:25.146
and we'll use a border property.
253

253

00:16:26.100  -->  00:16:27.958
This border property allows you
254

254

00:16:27.958  -->  00:16:30.209
to do three things.
255

255

00:16:30.209  -->  00:16:34.042
The border width, the line type and the color.
256

256

00:16:35.309  -->  00:16:38.068
So just write border and top, because
257

257

00:16:38.068  -->  00:16:41.542
we want it to be at the top of the box,
258

258

00:16:41.542  -->  00:16:44.042
and then say 1 pixel width and
259

259

00:16:45.899  -->  00:16:49.057
we want it to be solid so just
260

260

00:16:49.057  -->  00:16:52.974
a normal solid line and then a nice gray color.
261

261

00:16:54.341  -->  00:16:57.443
Remember how to do a gray color?
262

262

00:16:57.443  -->  00:17:01.028
You just have to put the same value
263

263

00:17:01.028  -->  00:17:03.778
on the three r, g and b channels.
264

264

00:17:05.405  -->  00:17:06.572
Let's see 333.
265

265

00:17:09.891  -->  00:17:13.391
And then with our color picker, Command E,
266

266

00:17:15.404  -->  00:17:18.402
and we can just adjust it.
267

267

00:17:18.402  -->  00:17:21.235
We can use another different gray.
268

268

00:17:23.100  -->  00:17:26.183
So maybe this one here, I don't know.
269

269

00:17:27.968  -->  00:17:29.385
Alright, save it.
270

270

00:17:32.620  -->  00:17:36.703
And here we go, here we have this nice gray line.
271

271

00:17:37.803  -->  00:17:40.679
And we probably also want some padding here,
272

272

00:17:40.679  -->  00:17:43.961
so that all this content is not just glued
273

273

00:17:43.961  -->  00:17:47.044
right to the top of this div element.
274

274

00:17:48.479  -->  00:17:51.229
So let's also define some padding
275

275

00:17:53.227  -->  00:17:55.894
at the top, let's say 20 pixels.
276

276

00:17:57.875  -->  00:17:59.660
These numbers are not important
277

277

00:17:59.660  -->  00:18:02.410
at this stage because we are just
278

278

00:18:03.772  -->  00:18:06.105
trying out some things here.
279

279

00:18:09.072  -->  00:18:10.907
Alright, so you see now we have
280

280

00:18:10.907  -->  00:18:12.824
this nice padding here.
281

281

00:18:14.180  -->  00:18:16.243
So alright, I think we are
282

282

00:18:16.243  -->  00:18:18.908
pretty much done with our layout here.
283

283

00:18:18.908  -->  00:18:22.121
So we used float and clear in order
284

284

00:18:22.121  -->  00:18:26.601
to put all our layout boxes where we wanted them
285

285

00:18:26.601  -->  00:18:29.867
and we used padding and margin to create
286

286

00:18:29.867  -->  00:18:32.568
some distances between the boxes
287

287

00:18:32.568  -->  00:18:34.668
and that's essentially all you need
288

288

00:18:34.668  -->  00:18:37.251
in order to build some layouts.
289

289

00:18:38.463  -->  00:18:40.214
So in the next lecture, we'll just
290

290

00:18:40.214  -->  00:18:43.165
improve some things here on our website
291

291

00:18:43.165  -->  00:18:46.755
in order to make it look a little bit better
292

292

00:18:46.755  -->  00:18:49.227
and to teach you some more techniques
293

293

00:18:49.227  -->  00:18:50.995
that you can use.
294

294

00:18:50.995  -->  00:18:53.245
Alright, so see you there.
