00:00:01,355  -->  00:00:04,532
<v Voiceover>Hello back, let's build one more section.</v>
2

2

00:00:04,532  -->  00:00:07,040
This one is where the customers tell about
3

3

00:00:07,040  -->  00:00:10,337
their experience with OMNI Food.
4

4

00:00:10,337  -->  00:00:14,076
And it is actually one of the sections I like the most.
5

5

00:00:14,076  -->  00:00:16,816
We will once again use beautiful food imagery
6

6

00:00:16,816  -->  00:00:19,161
to almost make the user feel hungry
7

7

00:00:19,161  -->  00:00:21,715
just by browsing our website.
8

8

00:00:21,715  -->  00:00:25,848
So here, we have just three customers, side by side
9

9

00:00:25,848  -->  00:00:27,706
and what they have to say.
10

10

00:00:27,706  -->  00:00:30,469
And this way of showing customer testimonials
11

11

00:00:30,469  -->  00:00:32,559
is actually pretty common.
12

12

00:00:32,559  -->  00:00:36,762
In this lecture, we will once again practice our skills.
13

13

00:00:36,762  -->  00:00:39,084
We'll learn how to create a beautiful effect
14

14

00:00:39,084  -->  00:00:42,892
with background images using just CSS
15

15

00:00:42,892  -->  00:00:44,610
and how to effectively communicate
16

16

00:00:44,610  -->  00:00:48,360
what customers have to say about our company.
17

17

00:00:49,997  -->  00:00:53,497
So, here we are back in our HTML document.
18

18

00:00:54,827  -->  00:00:56,893
And you'll see here, we already have
19

19

00:00:56,893  -->  00:00:59,143
way over 200 lines of code.
20

20

00:01:00,469  -->  00:01:01,552
Great, right?
21

21

00:01:03,836  -->  00:01:06,971
So as always, another section here.
22

22

00:01:06,971  -->  00:01:10,638
And this one is called Section Testimonials.
23

23

00:01:14,773  -->  00:01:18,940
Some space here, and now, starting with the title,
24

24

00:01:21,294  -->  00:01:23,986
let me just, as always,
25

25

00:01:23,986  -->  00:01:26,486
get the text for this section.
26

26

00:01:32,281  -->  00:01:33,442
And here we go.
27

27

00:01:33,442  -->  00:01:34,812
So the title here will be
28

28

00:01:34,812  -->  00:01:37,812
Our Customers Can't Live Without Us.
29

29

00:01:39,130  -->  00:01:39,963
So, giv,
30

30

00:01:42,130  -->  00:01:44,380
class and another row here.
31

31

00:01:45,539  -->  00:01:49,440
And in this row we will have nothing but the title.
32

32

00:01:49,440  -->  00:01:50,357
Ch2 snomed.
33

33

00:01:52,157  -->  00:01:55,477
Which we already are pretty used to by now.
34

34

00:01:55,477  -->  00:01:59,053
And now another row, and in this row
35

35

00:01:59,053  -->  00:02:03,326
is where we will have our customer opinions.
36

36

00:02:03,326  -->  00:02:06,243
Now, since we have three customers,
37

37

00:02:08,782  -->  00:02:13,287
we will of course include three columns here.
38

38

00:02:13,287  -->  00:02:16,213
So, you already know how to do this.
39

39

00:02:16,213  -->  00:02:17,713
Span one of three,
40

40

00:02:19,146  -->  00:02:22,366
because we have three columns.
41

41

00:02:22,366  -->  00:02:26,011
And now HTML actually has an element
42

42

00:02:26,011  -->  00:02:29,011
designed precisely to include quotes
43

43

00:02:30,781  -->  00:02:33,033
into HTML documents.
44

44

00:02:33,033  -->  00:02:37,200
And what I'm talking about, is the element blockquote.
45

45

00:02:40,649  -->  00:02:44,649
And in this element, we can just paste our text.
46

46

00:02:46,431  -->  00:02:47,264
Very well.
47

47

00:02:50,657  -->  00:02:53,722
And yet another HTML element,
48

48

00:02:53,722  -->  00:02:55,649
is the cite element.
49

49

00:02:55,649  -->  00:02:59,816
And the cite element is obviously where we will put
50

50

00:03:00,821  -->  00:03:02,654
the name of the person
51

51

00:03:04,453  -->  00:03:06,703
who expressed this opinion.
52

52

00:03:09,190  -->  00:03:12,371
So inside of the blockquote, usually goes the text
53

53

00:03:12,371  -->  00:03:15,807
and then the cite element where we will
54

54

00:03:15,807  -->  00:03:18,140
put the author of this text.
55

55

00:03:21,450  -->  00:03:25,954
Now, besides this text, we also have an image of this person
56

56

00:03:25,954  -->  00:03:30,121
and we can also include this into this cite element.
57

57

00:03:31,551  -->  00:03:35,218
So the image is pretty easy to include here.
58

58

00:03:37,913  -->  00:03:40,246
Let's go to Resources, Image
59

59

00:03:42,232  -->  00:03:43,811
and we have our customers down here.
60

60

00:03:43,811  -->  00:03:45,900
See, one, two, and three.
61

61

00:03:45,900  -->  00:03:49,317
So next I just have to change the number.
62

62

00:03:51,891  -->  00:03:54,391
So this is our first customer.
63

63

00:03:55,420  -->  00:03:58,920
And, okay, I think that's the correct HTML
64

64

00:04:00,366  -->  00:04:02,033
for one of the coms.
65

65

00:04:03,176  -->  00:04:05,676
Let me just copy this as usual
66

66

00:04:08,865  -->  00:04:10,282
and paste it here
67

67

00:04:12,033  -->  00:04:14,796
so we can complete our row.
68

68

00:04:14,796  -->  00:04:17,296
So we have three nice columns.
69

69

00:04:19,280  -->  00:04:22,863
Now, as always, let me copy this text here.
70

70

00:04:24,409  -->  00:04:25,909
It's Joana Silver.
71

71

00:04:28,449  -->  00:04:31,235
She comes probably from Portugal.
72

72

00:04:31,235  -->  00:04:33,402
And now this is image two.
73

73

00:04:35,415  -->  00:04:36,665
And that's her.
74

74

00:04:39,803  -->  00:04:41,220
And the last one.
75

75

00:04:46,630  -->  00:04:47,824
Great.
76

76

00:04:47,824  -->  00:04:49,991
And this is Milton Chapman
77

77

00:04:53,443  -->  00:04:55,110
with customer three.
78

78

00:04:56,810  -->  00:04:58,060
And here he is.
79

79

00:05:01,082  -->  00:05:03,799
Okay, you do it off the text and I think
80

80

00:05:03,799  -->  00:05:06,586
that should be your HTML code.
81

81

00:05:06,586  -->  00:05:09,253
We will not need more than this.
82

82

00:05:12,112  -->  00:05:14,779
So let's see what it looks like.
83

83

00:05:15,781  -->  00:05:18,079
This was our previous section
84

84

00:05:18,079  -->  00:05:19,983
and here is our current section.
85

85

00:05:19,983  -->  00:05:24,929
And what is happening here, this looks pretty weird.
86

86

00:05:24,929  -->  00:05:26,462
Well, what's going on here?
87

87

00:05:26,462  -->  00:05:27,879
Let's go back and
88

88

00:05:28,774  -->  00:05:31,191
okay, here I see the problem.
89

89

00:05:32,466  -->  00:05:34,556
It shouldn't be row, of course not,
90

90

00:05:34,556  -->  00:05:37,723
you probably saw this before I saw it.
91

91

00:05:38,596  -->  00:05:40,454
So it should be col.
92

92

00:05:40,454  -->  00:05:42,172
Of course, it's a column right?
93

93

00:05:42,172  -->  00:05:43,589
So let's go back.
94

94

00:05:44,982  -->  00:05:48,732
And now, this looks just as it should, right?
95

95

00:05:51,158  -->  00:05:54,084
So this is the HTML code, now it's correct.
96

96

00:05:54,084  -->  00:05:57,042
And let's format it in CSS
97

97

00:05:57,042  -->  00:05:58,709
in the next lecture.
