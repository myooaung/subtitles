00:00:02.410  -->  00:00:03.746
<v Voiceover>We're now going to talk</v>
2

2

00:00:03.746  -->  00:00:06.009
about element positioning.
3

3

00:00:06.009  -->  00:00:08.506
So far, all our elements were
4

4

00:00:08.506  -->  00:00:11.247
relative positioned elements.
5

5

00:00:11.247  -->  00:00:14.462
That means that their position on the Web page
6

6

00:00:14.462  -->  00:00:17.748
is determined by other elements.
7

7

00:00:17.748  -->  00:00:21.463
Now, elements with absolute position
8

8

00:00:21.463  -->  00:00:23.785
can be positioned anywhere we want
9

9

00:00:23.785  -->  00:00:26.885
inside their parent elements.
10

10

00:00:26.885  -->  00:00:31.087
But I guess I better show you how it works, right?
11

11

00:00:31.087  -->  00:00:33.769
Now back to our Web page.
12

12

00:00:33.769  -->  00:00:36.045
Suppose we wanted to know which date
13

13

00:00:36.045  -->  00:00:38.808
this article was written.
14

14

00:00:38.808  -->  00:00:42.391
In order to do that we can position a date,
15

15

00:00:43.591  -->  00:00:46.258
let's say in this location here,
16

16

00:00:48.166  -->  00:00:51.666
and the easiest way to do that is probably
17

17

00:00:52.508  -->  00:00:55.248
with absolute positioning.
18

18

00:00:55.248  -->  00:00:59.415
But let's first start by create a little paragraph
19

19

00:01:00.809  -->  00:01:03.392
where we could write that date.
20

20

00:01:07.310  -->  00:01:11.477
I will write that right after the main heading for now,
21

21

00:01:14.009  -->  00:01:18.725
but don't worry, we will position it then later.
22

22

00:01:18.725  -->  00:01:20.975
So, it will be a paragraph,
23

23

00:01:22.972  -->  00:01:25.389
and I will call it just date.
24

24

00:01:27.721  -->  00:01:30.388
And let's say, March 11th, 2015.
25

25

00:01:37.067  -->  00:01:38.817
So, how does it look?
26

26

00:01:40.027  -->  00:01:43.301
Not quite as we wanted, right?
27

27

00:01:43.301  -->  00:01:47.468
So, let's format it to put it exactly where we want it.
28

28

00:01:50.442  -->  00:01:54.447
So, back to the CSS, down here I will add
29

29

00:01:54.447  -->  00:01:58.114
a date class, as you already know how to do.
30

30

00:02:00.507  -->  00:02:02.168
Now the first thing we need to do is
31

31

00:02:02.168  -->  00:02:04.942
to ensure that the parent element is
32

32

00:02:04.942  -->  00:02:07.442
a relative-positioned element.
33

33

00:02:09.052  -->  00:02:12.552
In this case, the parent of this p element
34

34

00:02:14.741  -->  00:02:17.109
is this blog-post div.
35

35

00:02:17.109  -->  00:02:20.221
So, let's edit it and say that it's
36

36

00:02:20.221  -->  00:02:21.971
position is relative.
37

37

00:02:25.190  -->  00:02:28.940
All right, now we can format this class here.
38

38

00:02:33.886  -->  00:02:37.803
So, date as position absolute and not relative.
39

39

00:02:40.910  -->  00:02:44.486
And now, to put it exactly where we want it,
40

40

00:02:44.486  -->  00:02:47.824
we just say top zero, which means that it's
41

41

00:02:47.824  -->  00:02:51.241
right at the top with zero pixels between
42

42

00:02:52.394  -->  00:02:56.144
the top and the element, and right also zero,
43

43

00:02:59.418  -->  00:03:01.368
which means that there is no distance
44

44

00:03:01.368  -->  00:03:02.367
between the right side of the
45

45

00:03:02.367  -->  00:03:05.117
parent container and the element.
46

46

00:03:09.948  -->  00:03:14.929
And there it is in a top right corner, just as we said.
47

47

00:03:14.929  -->  00:03:19.654
Now it's not quite where we want it yet, right?
48

48

00:03:19.654  -->  00:03:22.835
So, you remember this pairing between
49

49

00:03:22.835  -->  00:03:26.085
this box and this was 30 pixels, right?
50

50

00:03:27.816  -->  00:03:31.032
So what we can do is to say that this element
51

51

00:03:31.032  -->  00:03:34.677
should have 30 pixels to the right side,
52

52

00:03:34.677  -->  00:03:38.844
which will move it all the way to this place here.
53

53

00:03:39.995  -->  00:03:42.131
And now it also seems a little bit
54

54

00:03:42.131  -->  00:03:45.010
too much at the top, so we can say that
55

55

00:03:45.010  -->  00:03:48.343
there should be a distance of 10 pixels.
56

56

00:03:49.504  -->  00:03:53.171
So, back in the CSS, the top is now 10 pixel
57

57

00:03:54.519  -->  00:03:57.102
and right, let's say 30 pixels.
58

58

00:04:00.324  -->  00:04:01.404
And there it is.
59

59

00:04:01.404  -->  00:04:03.154
Exactly as we wanted.
60

60

00:04:05.282  -->  00:04:08.881
All right, so, this is absolute positioning.
61

61

00:04:08.881  -->  00:04:10.231
It's very easy and very straightforward.
62

62

00:04:10.231  -->  00:04:13.478
We just have to ensure that the parent element
63

63

00:04:13.478  -->  00:04:17.716
is relative and that the absolute element
64

64

00:04:17.716  -->  00:04:21.049
has a position property set to absolute.
65

65

00:04:22.511  -->  00:04:24.868
As always, more on that later,
66

66

00:04:24.868  -->  00:04:27.156
when we will be working on our
67

67

00:04:27.156  -->  00:04:29.156
big big website project.
