00:00:01.871  -->  00:00:04.689
<v Voiceover>Welcome back, time to go back to Brackets</v>
2

2

00:00:04.689  -->  00:00:07.700
and get our hands dirty again.
3

3

00:00:07.700  -->  00:00:11.401
I'm really excited to start building this website.
4

4

00:00:11.401  -->  00:00:13.355
In this lecture we will start
5

5

00:00:13.355  -->  00:00:15.187
by setting everything up.
6

6

00:00:15.187  -->  00:00:16.187
So let's go.
7

7

00:00:17.586  -->  00:00:19.577
Now the first step is to actually
8

8

00:00:19.577  -->  00:00:21.893
create a nice folder structure
9

9

00:00:21.893  -->  00:00:25.472
where we keep all our files very organized.
10

10

00:00:25.472  -->  00:00:29.639
And that you can later use for much, much bigger projects.
11

11

00:00:31.737  -->  00:00:35.849
So I'll start by creating here a new folder.
12

12

00:00:35.849  -->  00:00:38.349
And I will call this omnifood.
13

13

00:00:42.233  -->  00:00:43.066
Omnifood.
14

14

00:00:44.958  -->  00:00:47.458
Alright, so now inside of this
15

15

00:00:50.734  -->  00:00:54.734
I will create the first folder called resources.
16

16

00:00:56.546  -->  00:01:00.463
And inside of that folder, show you, like this,
17

17

00:01:01.955  -->  00:01:04.955
okay, inside of the resources folder
18

18

00:01:05.980  -->  00:01:09.063
we'll put a folder for our CSS files,
19

19

00:01:10.333  -->  00:01:13.916
another folder for JavaScript where we will
20

20

00:01:15.345  -->  00:01:17.428
put all our jQuery files,
21

21

00:01:21.481  -->  00:01:25.510
then another folder for the images that
22

22

00:01:25.510  -->  00:01:28.427
we are going to use in the project,
23

23

00:01:29.903  -->  00:01:32.570
and also a folder for some data.
24

24

00:01:34.584  -->  00:01:37.187
We'll probably not need this folder,
25

25

00:01:37.187  -->  00:01:39.795
but I will include it here, so, you know
26

26

00:01:39.795  -->  00:01:42.645
where to put it in case you need it
27

27

00:01:42.645  -->  00:01:45.645
for some projects of your own later.
28

28

00:01:47.444  -->  00:01:51.338
And inside of this CSS folder I will put another
29

29

00:01:51.338  -->  00:01:54.141
folder for images, and the difference
30

30

00:01:54.141  -->  00:01:56.215
between this one and the other one
31

31

00:01:56.215  -->  00:01:59.508
is that these images are going
32

32

00:01:59.508  -->  00:02:03.258
to be used by CSS, such as background images.
33

33

00:02:05.000  -->  00:02:07.681
Okay, so in the resource folders
34

34

00:02:07.681  -->  00:02:11.598
go the files that are created by us, basically.
35

35

00:02:13.411  -->  00:02:16.216
Then we have another folder here
36

36

00:02:16.216  -->  00:02:18.216
which is called vendors.
37

37

00:02:20.652  -->  00:02:23.335
And in here we have some similar folders,
38

38

00:02:23.335  -->  00:02:26.343
again, CSS, but the difference is
39

39

00:02:26.343  -->  00:02:30.510
that this folder is for CSS that was not created by us.
40

40

00:02:31.824  -->  00:02:34.508
So that we download it from the internet
41

41

00:02:34.508  -->  00:02:37.183
and use for our project.
42

42

00:02:37.183  -->  00:02:40.266
And another one for JavaScript files,
43

43

00:02:41.292  -->  00:02:44.125
and one for fonts, that's probably
44

44

00:02:45.282  -->  00:02:47.699
where our icon fonts will go.
45

45

00:02:51.666  -->  00:02:54.266
So this is a structure that is very flexible
46

46

00:02:54.266  -->  00:02:57.804
and allows us to separate the files
47

47

00:02:57.804  -->  00:03:00.087
that were created by us and files
48

48

00:03:00.087  -->  00:03:02.527
that we download from the internet
49

49

00:03:02.527  -->  00:03:05.610
like JavaScript plugins or CSS files,
50

50

00:03:08.176  -->  00:03:10.759
such we are going to use later.
51

51

00:03:12.689  -->  00:03:16.474
Alright, so this is our folder structure.
52

52

00:03:16.474  -->  00:03:20.057
So now let's go to Brackets, and back here,
53

53

00:03:24.326  -->  00:03:27.896
this is our old project, you probably remember
54

54

00:03:27.896  -->  00:03:31.590
how to open a project, or create a new one,
55

55

00:03:31.590  -->  00:03:35.653
it's here, this button, and hit open folder,
56

56

00:03:35.653  -->  00:03:38.403
and it's on the desktop omnifood.
57

57

00:03:40.170  -->  00:03:43.055
Okay, so that is our working folder.
58

58

00:03:43.055  -->  00:03:47.205
Now let's start by creating a new HTML file,
59

59

00:03:47.205  -->  00:03:51.288
and I will save it and call it again, index.html,
60

60

00:03:53.997  -->  00:03:58.164
and also a new CSS file which I will leave empty for now.
61

61

00:04:00.102  -->  00:04:02.519
This one is again, style.css.
62

62

00:04:05.218  -->  00:04:09.240
So let's create our HTML structure here starting
63

63

00:04:09.240  -->  00:04:12.907
with the doc type, I hope you remember this.
64

64

00:04:15.944  -->  00:04:20.111
DOCTYPE html, alright, you remember what comes next?
65

65

00:04:22.219  -->  00:04:24.219
Now is the HTML element.
66

66

00:04:26.260  -->  00:04:30.041
Give it some space, and one thing we didn't do
67

67

00:04:30.041  -->  00:04:33.011
in the first project, but I'm going to do it now,
68

68

00:04:33.011  -->  00:04:35.511
is specify the lang attribute.
69

69

00:04:37.883  -->  00:04:41.633
And we will say that this page is in English.
70

70

00:04:42.766  -->  00:04:46.348
Alright, inside of the HTML we have again,
71

71

00:04:46.348  -->  00:04:48.598
the head, and then the body
72

72

00:04:53.271  -->  00:04:56.188
where all our main content will go.
73

73

00:04:59.739  -->  00:05:02.822
Okay, I will now include the CSS file
74

74

00:05:05.383  -->  00:05:07.745
which is, as you probably remember,
75

75

00:05:07.745  -->  00:05:10.245
link then rel, say stylesheet,
76

76

00:05:13.543  -->  00:05:17.293
then I say it's type, CSS, and now I actually
77

77

00:05:21.413  -->  00:05:24.163
realize that I did a mistake here
78

78

00:05:26.658  -->  00:05:29.491
because I want this file, you see,
79

79

00:05:32.350  -->  00:05:35.074
I put this file right here, but that's not
80

80

00:05:35.074  -->  00:05:39.241
where I want it, I want it right in our CSS folder.
81

81

00:05:40.719  -->  00:05:42.219
Right here, right.
82

82

00:05:46.328  -->  00:05:49.067
So let me see, so as I have told you before
83

83

00:05:49.067  -->  00:05:51.551
we have this file tree here where we can see
84

84

00:05:51.551  -->  00:05:54.153
all of our files, okay, here it is.
85

85

00:05:54.153  -->  00:05:56.630
So I can just delete this one.
86

86

00:05:56.630  -->  00:05:59.316
So Brackets allows you to use this
87

87

00:05:59.316  -->  00:06:02.149
as a file explorer, you can delete
88

88

00:06:03.669  -->  00:06:06.752
and manipulate files in here as well.
89

89

00:06:08.228  -->  00:06:09.893
So now let me establish the link
90

90

00:06:09.893  -->  00:06:12.226
between these two documents.
91

91

00:06:13.473  -->  00:06:16.890
Alright, href, and it's inside resources,
92

92

00:06:18.469  -->  00:06:22.636
inside the CSS folder, and it's style.css, and that's it.
93

93

00:06:27.451  -->  00:06:31.618
Now we'll just give it a nice title, just Omnifood for now,
94

94

00:06:37.311  -->  00:06:39.428
you can just change this later.
95

95

00:06:39.428  -->  00:06:41.911
And we will also put much more stuff here
96

96

00:06:41.911  -->  00:06:44.513
in the head section later on.
97

97

00:06:44.513  -->  00:06:46.790
Now in our CSS file I want to include
98

98

00:06:46.790  -->  00:06:50.957
right now is a CSS file which is called normalize.css.
99

99

00:06:53.467  -->  00:06:58.147
And as you can see here, normalize.css makes browsers
100

100

00:06:58.147  -->  00:07:00.917
render all elements more consistently
101

101

00:07:00.917  -->  00:07:03.197
and in line with modern standards.
102

102

00:07:03.197  -->  00:07:08.003
It precisely targets only the styles that needs normalizing.
103

103

00:07:08.003  -->  00:07:11.748
So it's like a CSS reset which makes CSS
104

104

00:07:11.748  -->  00:07:14.331
looks the same in all browsers.
105

105

00:07:15.208  -->  00:07:18.125
I'll hit this, now I will save this
106

106

00:07:20.694  -->  00:07:24.356
inside our project folder, omnifood,
107

107

00:07:24.356  -->  00:07:28.418
and as I explained before, this is a file
108

108

00:07:28.418  -->  00:07:31.100
we got from the internet, it's not our file,
109

109

00:07:31.100  -->  00:07:34.107
so I'll put this inside the CSS folder
110

110

00:07:34.107  -->  00:07:36.690
in the vendors folder, alright.
111

111

00:07:43.137  -->  00:07:45.705
So let's include it here.
112

112

00:07:45.705  -->  00:07:49.288
And it actually has to go before this file.
113

113

00:07:53.392  -->  00:07:57.225
So link, again, all of this stuff, stylesheet,
114

114

00:08:02.044  -->  00:08:06.211
type, CSS, href, now it's in the resources, CSS, normalize.
115

115

00:08:12.331  -->  00:08:16.498
Right, now the next step we do in this kind of setup
116

116

00:08:18.113  -->  00:08:22.266
process is to include the web font we chose.
117

117

00:08:22.266  -->  00:08:25.033
Do you remember, it was Lato.
118

118

00:08:25.033  -->  00:08:29.200
So I will go to Google Fonts, and it's actually right here.
119

119

00:08:31.165  -->  00:08:33.248
So this is the Lato font.
120

120

00:08:38.155  -->  00:08:41.893
See here, there are some others here,
121

121

00:08:41.893  -->  00:08:42.976
this is Lato.
122

122

00:08:44.170  -->  00:08:47.382
So these are the different styles which are available
123

123

00:08:47.382  -->  00:08:51.549
for this typeface, with the different font weights,
124

124

00:08:52.954  -->  00:08:55.067
and down here some italics.
125

125

00:08:55.067  -->  00:08:57.317
So we want to use this one.
126

126

00:08:58.848  -->  00:09:02.430
And here we gotta select all the styles we want.
127

127

00:09:02.430  -->  00:09:05.847
And I want the light one, and the normal,
128

128

00:09:08.649  -->  00:09:11.283
which is already selected, I don't know
129

129

00:09:11.283  -->  00:09:15.450
about the very thin, but for now I will just use this,
130

130

00:09:18.797  -->  00:09:22.130
and also the italics, this one, we don't
131

131

00:09:23.064  -->  00:09:26.086
want to use all of them because that would
132

132

00:09:26.086  -->  00:09:29.169
effect the page speed of our webpage.
133

133

00:09:33.531  -->  00:09:36.135
So we will just use these four one for now,
134

134

00:09:36.135  -->  00:09:41.094
and we can always select more if we need them later.
135

135

00:09:41.094  -->  00:09:43.613
So it's very, very easy.
136

136

00:09:43.613  -->  00:09:47.309
All we have to do now is to come down here
137

137

00:09:47.309  -->  00:09:51.309
and copy this link and go back to our HTML file,
138

138

00:09:53.486  -->  00:09:56.236
and paste it here, and that's it.
139

139

00:09:57.962  -->  00:10:00.234
And that's because this Google Font
140

140

00:10:00.234  -->  00:10:02.567
is actually just a CSS file.
141

141

00:10:04.300  -->  00:10:07.389
Which we use here in our project,
142

142

00:10:07.389  -->  00:10:08.730
but it's not a file that we download,
143

143

00:10:08.730  -->  00:10:11.563
it's a file that's in the internet
144

144

00:10:13.570  -->  00:10:16.153
here on the Google Font server.
145

145

00:10:19.386  -->  00:10:23.553
Alright, so let's make the first CSS definitions here.
146

146

00:10:29.140  -->  00:10:32.973
As you remember maybe, from our first project,
147

147

00:10:34.023  -->  00:10:38.023
we should target R elements and put their margin
148

148

00:10:39.095  -->  00:10:41.288
and padding to zero, that's always
149

149

00:10:41.288  -->  00:10:43.455
the first thing that I do.
150

150

00:10:44.745  -->  00:10:47.995
And I also set the box sizing property,
151

151

00:10:49.020  -->  00:10:53.187
which we talked about before, which is border box.
152

152

00:10:54.634  -->  00:10:58.801
Alright, so now all margins and paddings are gone.
153

153

00:11:02.488  -->  00:11:05.984
And now for the HTML we also make
154

154

00:11:05.984  -->  00:11:09.651
this basic setup so that we can get started.
155

155

00:11:10.688  -->  00:11:14.855
So the first thing I will set the background color,
156

156

00:11:16.665  -->  00:11:18.855
now the background color is not necessary
157

157

00:11:18.855  -->  00:11:21.863
'cause I want it to be white and that's the default,
158

158

00:11:21.863  -->  00:11:24.063
so it's not necessary, but just to
159

159

00:11:24.063  -->  00:11:26.313
show you I'll do it anyway.
160

160

00:11:28.454  -->  00:11:32.287
And we know that white is FFF, okay now we can
161

161

00:11:34.188  -->  00:11:37.688
set the text color for the entire project,
162

162

00:11:40.042  -->  00:11:43.455
and what I like to do is to start with black,
163

163

00:11:43.455  -->  00:11:46.541
'cause I know it's 000, then I use
164

164

00:11:46.541  -->  00:11:49.220
the color picker as we did before,
165

165

00:11:49.220  -->  00:11:53.387
with command, E, and choose a nice gray from here.
166

166

00:11:55.606  -->  00:11:59.023
Now we'll use this one, 555, which is not
167

167

00:12:00.692  -->  00:12:02.888
too dark and not too light,
168

168

00:12:02.888  -->  00:12:07.237
but if we want we can change this later as well.
169

169

00:12:07.237  -->  00:12:10.237
And we can also set the font family.
170

170

00:12:12.758  -->  00:12:15.508
So we will use, as we said, Lato.
171

171

00:12:17.312  -->  00:12:19.223
So all we need to do to set this family
172

172

00:12:19.223  -->  00:12:23.306
is to include the CSS file such as we did before,
173

173

00:12:25.033  -->  00:12:28.286
and then use that font name right here.
174

174

00:12:28.286  -->  00:12:32.274
Now as a second choice, as I did before,
175

175

00:12:32.274  -->  00:12:34.875
I will say just Ariel, and this is what
176

176

00:12:34.875  -->  00:12:37.027
happens, for example, if the user has
177

177

00:12:37.027  -->  00:12:40.486
no internet connection for, I don't know
178

178

00:12:40.486  -->  00:12:43.817
which reason, so if Lato can't be displayed,
179

179

00:12:43.817  -->  00:12:46.621
Ariel will be displayed instead.
180

180

00:12:46.621  -->  00:12:50.280
And now, if Ariel is not available as well,
181

181

00:12:50.280  -->  00:12:54.447
then we have this CSS keyword which is sans-serif,
182

182

00:12:56.801  -->  00:13:00.396
so if Lato and Ariel are both not available,
183

183

00:13:00.396  -->  00:13:03.563
then any sans-serif font will be used.
184

184

00:13:04.832  -->  00:13:07.838
And I will also set a font size.
185

185

00:13:07.838  -->  00:13:11.699
A overall font size for the project to 20 pixels.
186

186

00:13:11.699  -->  00:13:15.866
If that's too much, we can always put it back later.
187

187

00:13:16.979  -->  00:13:21.697
Another thing about the font is to set the font weight.
188

188

00:13:21.697  -->  00:13:24.706
I'll say font weight, and if you remember,
189

189

00:13:24.706  -->  00:13:28.873
I will go back here, we selected 100, 300 and 400,
190

190

00:13:31.367  -->  00:13:35.284
and the default that I will choose here is 300.
191

191

00:13:36.902  -->  00:13:40.235
And the last thing that I should do here
192

192

00:13:41.212  -->  00:13:45.212
is text rendering, and then optimize legibility.
193

193

00:13:48.045  -->  00:13:52.212
This will make our fonts rendering in a perfect way.
194

194

00:13:53.089  -->  00:13:56.302
Okay, I think that now we're ready to start.
195

195

00:13:56.302  -->  00:13:59.469
All the setup is done, let me just see
196

196

00:14:00.447  -->  00:14:04.614
if everything works, we'll just put in some h1 element here,
197

197

00:14:06.103  -->  00:14:09.353
put Omnifood, and test the whole thing.
198

198

00:14:10.453  -->  00:14:14.620
Open the live connection as we did before, takes some time.
199

199

00:14:16.998  -->  00:14:21.165
Alright, this is Omnifood, with the font we just selected
200

200

00:14:22.408  -->  00:14:25.333
and with the font size we selected
201

201

00:14:25.333  -->  00:14:27.728
and with the font color.
202

202

00:14:27.728  -->  00:14:31.504
So that was the basic setup of our project.
203

203

00:14:31.504  -->  00:14:35.254
Next we can start to actually build the site.
