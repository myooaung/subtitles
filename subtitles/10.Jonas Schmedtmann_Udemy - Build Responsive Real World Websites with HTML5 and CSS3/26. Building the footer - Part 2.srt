00:00:01,583  -->  00:00:03,996
<v Voiceover>Welcome back to building the footer.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,996  -->  00:00:07,913
Let's write some more CSS to format our footer.
3

3

00:00:10,912  -->  00:00:14,956
So, here we are again as I said before we want
4

4

00:00:14,956  -->  00:00:19,628
to, of course, have these links side by side.
5

5

00:00:19,628  -->  00:00:22,645
And we want to get rid of these bullet points
6

6

00:00:22,645  -->  00:00:24,851
and we want to format the whole thing.
7

7

00:00:24,851  -->  00:00:27,999
And we also want a very dark background
8

8

00:00:27,999  -->  00:00:32,166
for this footer in order to make it, kind of, stand out.
9

9

00:00:34,978  -->  00:00:39,145
So let's go to our CSS.
10

10

00:00:41,830  -->  00:00:42,663
And the thing's we're going to
11

11

00:00:42,663  -->  00:00:45,580
do are, actually, quite easy to do.
12

12

00:00:47,335  -->  00:00:51,502
It's just to repeat some things we already did before.
13

13

00:00:55,666  -->  00:00:59,199
So to start,
14

14

00:00:59,199  -->  00:01:02,699
let's make a darker background color here.
15

15

00:01:07,706  -->  00:01:11,873
Of course, not black, but we want it kind of deep.
16

16

00:01:13,950  -->  00:01:17,200
And I like to use this color, actually.
17

17

00:01:18,305  -->  00:01:20,138
Let's just check this.
18

18

00:01:21,014  -->  00:01:22,973
Okay, this makes a great contrast between this
19

19

00:01:22,973  -->  00:01:27,140
white and this gray and now I will make the text, like
20

20

00:01:28,109  -->  00:01:32,276
white or a very light gray.
21

21

00:01:33,243  -->  00:01:36,743
But first, let's format those navigations.
22

22

00:01:38,789  -->  00:01:40,622
So we have Footer Nav.
23

23

00:01:43,245  -->  00:01:48,061
And we want it to have no bullet points as always.
24

24

00:01:48,061  -->  00:01:50,115
And we want this one to float on
25

25

00:01:50,115  -->  00:01:53,365
the left side, inside of its container.
26

26

00:01:54,948  -->  00:01:57,698
And then we have to social icons.
27

27

00:01:59,650  -->  00:02:02,483
And we also want no bullet points.
28

28

00:02:03,960  -->  00:02:08,127
And this one we want to float all the way to the right side.
29

29

00:02:12,507  -->  00:02:16,674
On the list elements inside of these navigations
30

30

00:02:17,643  -->  00:02:21,388
of these unordered lists, we want to have them
31

31

00:02:21,388  -->  00:02:24,357
side by side and so one thing that we
32

32

00:02:24,357  -->  00:02:27,252
can do is to display them as in line blocks.
33

33

00:02:27,252  -->  00:02:29,597
And this way they will not cause a line break
34

34

00:02:29,597  -->  00:02:32,070
so they will be side by side and we can
35

35

00:02:32,070  -->  00:02:34,487
also assign them some margin.
36

36

00:02:36,504  -->  00:02:39,837
So what we can do here is Footer Nav LI.
37

37

00:02:41,452  -->  00:02:45,619
And we can actually do the same thing for the social icons.
38

38

00:02:47,141  -->  00:02:51,058
Because we want them to behave in the same way.
39

39

00:02:53,654  -->  00:02:57,153
So we use our very much used property display
40

40

00:02:57,153  -->  00:03:01,320
and in line block and then we can set a nice margin
41

41

00:03:02,300  -->  00:03:05,728
to the right side of each of them
42

42

00:03:05,728  -->  00:03:08,401
in order to give them some spacing.
43

43

00:03:08,401  -->  00:03:11,484
So margin right, let's say 20 pixels.
44

44

00:03:12,916  -->  00:03:15,653
Okay, let's check this.
45

45

00:03:15,653  -->  00:03:19,250
Okay, they are already side by side, at least these ones.
46

46

00:03:19,250  -->  00:03:22,500
There must be something wrong with this here.
47

47

00:03:22,500  -->  00:03:25,750
So, let me check what's happening here.
48

48

00:03:27,391  -->  00:03:30,306
Maybe it's not the right name.
49

49

00:03:30,306  -->  00:03:34,090
Oh, alright, it's social links here.
50

50

00:03:34,090  -->  00:03:35,642
Of course it's not social icons,
51

51

00:03:35,642  -->  00:03:38,142
social links and social links.
52

52

00:03:41,739  -->  00:03:44,989
And now these are side by side as well.
53

53

00:03:46,407  -->  00:03:51,091
Now there's only one tiny problem left with these
54

54

00:03:51,091  -->  00:03:53,754
LI elements and let me show you what I'm talking about
55

55

00:03:53,754  -->  00:03:57,267
and for that I will use inspect element.
56

56

00:03:57,267  -->  00:04:00,684
So you will see again how useful this is.
57

57

00:04:02,077  -->  00:04:03,591
So where do we have our footer?
58

58

00:04:03,591  -->  00:04:07,758
Okay, it's right here and so with the blue highlighting
59

59

00:04:09,143  -->  00:04:13,310
you see the row class and so you can see that
60

60

00:04:14,331  -->  00:04:18,451
here we have some space between the last icon
61

61

00:04:18,451  -->  00:04:21,270
and the end of the row, right?
62

62

00:04:21,270  -->  00:04:26,180
So the icon is not all the way to the right side of the row.
63

63

00:04:26,180  -->  00:04:28,767
And that's because of the margin right we defined
64

64

00:04:28,767  -->  00:04:31,803
of 20 pixels so what we need to do
65

65

00:04:31,803  -->  00:04:35,636
is to get rid of that for the last LI element.
66

66

00:04:37,449  -->  00:04:38,866
So let's do that.
67

67

00:04:40,742  -->  00:04:43,907
And as you know the connection between brackets
68

68

00:04:43,907  -->  00:04:45,907
and the browser was lost
69

69

00:04:47,099  -->  00:04:50,249
because we that.
70

70

00:04:50,249  -->  00:04:51,730
So let's go back here.
71

71

00:04:51,730  -->  00:04:55,166
And now what we do is, of course,
72

72

00:04:55,166  -->  00:04:58,441
such as we did it before
73

73

00:04:58,441  -->  00:05:02,608
we use the last child pseudo class.
74

74

00:05:04,953  -->  00:05:08,508
So last child
75

75

00:05:08,508  -->  00:05:11,508
and last child.
76

76

00:05:13,635  -->  00:05:16,635
And then we say we want margin zero.
77

77

00:05:17,546  -->  00:05:19,495
We can say we want margin right but
78

78

00:05:19,495  -->  00:05:21,912
it's actually the same thing.
79

79

00:05:23,495  -->  00:05:25,967
So you see that now this is better
80

80

00:05:25,967  -->  00:05:28,478
now we'll inspect it again, actually.
81

81

00:05:28,478  -->  00:05:31,478
So to prove to you that this worked,
82

82

00:05:32,434  -->  00:05:35,017
Okay, right this is better now.
83

83

00:05:38,581  -->  00:05:42,748
So then, let's now format this text here, these links.
84

84

00:05:47,165  -->  00:05:51,332
And you see we have to get rid of this text in the html.
85

85

00:05:54,162  -->  00:05:55,912
It's down here still.
86

86

00:05:59,036  -->  00:06:03,203
Okay so these are links and so I hope
87

87

00:06:04,477  -->  00:06:08,368
that you can do this on your own by now.
88

88

00:06:08,368  -->  00:06:12,535
So Footer Nav LI
89

89

00:06:13,390  -->  00:06:16,421
and then the links inside of it.
90

90

00:06:16,421  -->  00:06:20,588
And I will use the links state.
91

91

00:06:22,557  -->  00:06:26,724
And then Footer Nav LI A visited.
92

92

00:06:30,275  -->  00:06:34,025
And we want this to happen as well
93

93

00:06:35,533  -->  00:06:39,366
for the social links.
94

94

00:06:49,668  -->  00:06:53,835
We want of course now text decoration so now underlining.
95

95

00:06:57,436  -->  00:07:01,534
And we also want no border because, if you remember,
96

96

00:07:01,534  -->  00:07:05,261
we defined that those links should have a border.
97

97

00:07:05,261  -->  00:07:09,428
We defined it all the way up here.
98

98

00:07:11,034  -->  00:07:14,367
So all the usual links have this border.
99

99

00:07:16,568  -->  00:07:18,818
So we just get rid of this.
100

100

00:07:22,152  -->  00:07:26,565
And as I said, I also want a nice text color for them
101

101

00:07:26,565  -->  00:07:29,640
because that orange really doesn't look great.
102

102

00:07:29,640  -->  00:07:34,577
So I will start with white and then use the color picker
103

103

00:07:34,577  -->  00:07:39,125
to go with something else.
104

104

00:07:39,125  -->  00:07:43,292
So we want something a little bit dark.
105

105

00:07:44,569  -->  00:07:47,460
Okay, this color looks good.
106

106

00:07:47,460  -->  00:07:49,517
I really like those colors where
107

107

00:07:49,517  -->  00:07:52,719
we only need those three digits.
108

108

00:07:52,719  -->  00:07:56,851
And up here it's, of course, visited
109

109

00:07:56,851  -->  00:08:01,347
and not vistad or whatever that is.
110

110

00:08:01,347  -->  00:08:05,014
I think now we should be good to check this.
111

111

00:08:07,853  -->  00:08:10,475
It looks a little dark, but it's on purpose
112

112

00:08:10,475  -->  00:08:12,491
because I will then, with the
113

113

00:08:12,491  -->  00:08:16,561
hover effect make the color look lighter
114

114

00:08:16,561  -->  00:08:20,620
because we don't want to stand this out to much.
115

115

00:08:20,620  -->  00:08:24,217
And so this is good and we will now add
116

116

00:08:24,217  -->  00:08:28,384
some hover effect to these links here.
117

117

00:08:29,262  -->  00:08:30,679
So let's do that.
118

118

00:08:32,380  -->  00:08:36,547
So Footer Nav L A I and hover.
119

119

00:08:45,864  -->  00:08:47,781
And, of course, active.
120

120

00:08:49,006  -->  00:08:52,173
So if we want to change this to color,
121

121

00:08:53,393  -->  00:08:56,643
not too white, but something like that.
122

122

00:08:58,237  -->  00:08:59,987
Let's say, this one.
123

123

00:09:01,022  -->  00:09:05,022
And we want of course to have a transition there
124

124

00:09:05,922  -->  00:09:10,089
for the color property of zero point two seconds interval.
125

125

00:09:16,956  -->  00:09:19,392
Now, of course, we also need some
126

126

00:09:19,392  -->  00:09:22,309
padding here in this footer, right?
127

127

00:09:23,847  -->  00:09:28,014
And also we want to format this text here, this paragraph.
128

128

00:09:30,804  -->  00:09:33,784
So let's do these two things and then we
129

129

00:09:33,784  -->  00:09:36,617
will worry about these icons here.
130

130

00:09:39,496  -->  00:09:42,697
So we want a heading for this footer.
131

131

00:09:42,697  -->  00:09:46,408
Not quite as big as we had with the other sections
132

132

00:09:46,408  -->  00:09:49,666
so let's say 60 pixels, for instance,
133

133

00:09:49,666  -->  00:09:53,251
and we will then see if it looks great.
134

134

00:09:53,251  -->  00:09:55,739
And now let's just format the
135

135

00:09:55,739  -->  00:09:58,239
paragraph inside of the footer
136

136

00:09:59,288  -->  00:10:03,455
to have the same color as the links
137

137

00:10:04,367  -->  00:10:07,851
which is 8888.
138

138

00:10:07,851  -->  00:10:12,018
And we can also center the text. The text align, centerer.
139

139

00:10:15,932  -->  00:10:20,168
And we can maybe even decrease the font size a little bit
140

140

00:10:20,168  -->  00:10:22,292
because it's not necessary that it's
141

141

00:10:22,292  -->  00:10:25,542
as big as the main text on the website.
142

142

00:10:33,968  -->  00:10:38,135
Yeah, probably 60 pixels was still a little too much.
143

143

00:10:39,130  -->  00:10:43,804
We will decrease this to 50 pixels or 40
144

144

00:10:43,804  -->  00:10:48,331
and also some distance between this paragraph
145

145

00:10:48,331  -->  00:10:50,213
and these navigations so the best
146

146

00:10:50,213  -->  00:10:52,717
way of doing that is to add a margin
147

147

00:10:52,717  -->  00:10:55,483
to the top of the paragraph.
148

148

00:10:55,483  -->  00:10:59,007
So margin top, 30 pixels, let's say
149

149

00:10:59,007  -->  00:11:02,674
and here we change that to 50.
150

150

00:11:06,103  -->  00:11:09,729
So, of course, this looks a little empty here right now
151

151

00:11:09,729  -->  00:11:13,787
because you could actually add some more text here
152

152

00:11:13,787  -->  00:11:16,301
or, I don't know, something else.
153

153

00:11:16,301  -->  00:11:19,884
In this case we will not worry about this
154

154

00:11:19,884  -->  00:11:24,410
because it's just a photo to show you what we can do
155

155

00:11:24,410  -->  00:11:27,410
and how all of this works.
156

156

00:11:28,264  -->  00:11:30,575
So now let's worry about these icons
157

157

00:11:30,575  -->  00:11:33,994
and what I want to do here is to, of course,
158

158

00:11:33,994  -->  00:11:35,921
make those a little bit bigger but then
159

159

00:11:35,921  -->  00:11:38,046
the hover effect, we will do something cool
160

160

00:11:38,046  -->  00:11:41,457
which is, in each of these icons, we will
161

161

00:11:41,457  -->  00:11:45,894
change the color of the icon to the color
162

162

00:11:45,894  -->  00:11:48,900
of the corresponding social network
163

163

00:11:48,900  -->  00:11:52,851
and I have a great site where we can see all of these colors
164

164

00:11:52,851  -->  00:11:55,418
so with Facebook we will change to this color.
165

165

00:11:55,418  -->  00:11:58,402
The Twitter button we will change to this color.
166

166

00:11:58,402  -->  00:12:01,892
The Google Plus and the Instagram so we have
167

167

00:12:01,892  -->  00:12:06,059
those colors here and then we will just have to copy them.
168

168

00:12:08,069  -->  00:12:10,652
So let's do that.
169

169

00:12:12,317  -->  00:12:13,650
Back in the CSS,
170

170

00:12:16,708  -->  00:12:20,208
actually put this right here.
171

171

00:12:22,070  -->  00:12:26,237
So, do social links LI,
172

172

00:12:28,959  -->  00:12:31,408
write link
173

173

00:12:31,408  -->  00:12:36,393
and social links
174

174

00:12:36,393  -->  00:12:39,226
the visited state,
175

175

00:12:40,382  -->  00:12:42,809
let's make them a little bit bigger
176

176

00:12:42,809  -->  00:12:46,976
font size, say 180 percent
177

177

00:12:48,644  -->  00:12:52,811
and we will then target each of the specific icons.
178

178

00:12:55,718  -->  00:12:59,612
We will use these classes here so it's just
179

179

00:12:59,612  -->  00:13:03,779
ion social and then the name of each of the social networks.
180

180

00:13:06,753  -->  00:13:08,961
We will then, the best way of doing this is
181

181

00:13:08,961  -->  00:13:12,628
to, actually put the hover effect right
182

182

00:13:13,655  -->  00:13:15,738
on each of these classes.
183

183

00:13:21,643  -->  00:13:22,643
So let's see
184

184

00:13:25,833  -->  00:13:28,867
which color value we're going to use.
185

185

00:13:28,867  -->  00:13:33,034
So this is for Facebook.
186

186

00:13:33,948  -->  00:13:36,115
And that should work.
187

187

00:13:37,481  -->  00:13:39,148
I'll just copy this.
188

188

00:13:43,153  -->  00:13:44,070
So Twitter,
189

189

00:13:47,716  -->  00:13:48,716
Google plus,
190

190

00:13:50,676  -->  00:13:53,676
and Instagram.
191

191

00:13:58,797  -->  00:14:00,714
So this is for Twitter.
192

192

00:14:05,899  -->  00:14:07,899
For Google Plus.
193

193

00:14:11,544  -->  00:14:15,461
And then, the last one is for Instagram.
194

194

00:14:21,228  -->  00:14:23,311
And let's check this out.
195

195

00:14:27,049  -->  00:14:29,036
Whoa, these are way too big, of course,
196

196

00:14:29,036  -->  00:14:33,203
but the color effect works actually and this is pretty great
197

197

00:14:34,888  -->  00:14:37,084
and this looks really cool, right?
198

198

00:14:37,084  -->  00:14:39,417
Now what we have to do is to
199

199

00:14:40,740  -->  00:14:42,740
also add that transition
200

200

00:14:43,668  -->  00:14:47,835
that we want and we're going to do that back here.
201

201

00:14:54,903  -->  00:14:57,903
So we have to do it this way.
202

202

00:15:05,312  -->  00:15:09,395
So Twitter, Google Plus, and Instagram.
203

203

00:15:13,330  -->  00:15:17,504
And then we just say that we want a transition
204

204

00:15:17,504  -->  00:15:21,671
for the color of zero point two seconds.
205

205

00:15:26,610  -->  00:15:28,360
Let's check this out.
206

206

00:15:29,565  -->  00:15:31,389
And here we go.
207

207

00:15:31,389  -->  00:15:33,389
Here we have our effect.
208

208

00:15:34,456  -->  00:15:38,368
So actually I think that the entire text here is a little
209

209

00:15:38,368  -->  00:15:42,499
too big so I'll just reduce all of the text
210

210

00:15:42,499  -->  00:15:46,511
because, as I said, I don't want to make all of this
211

211

00:15:46,511  -->  00:15:48,636
stand out too much and all of these links
212

212

00:15:48,636  -->  00:15:52,803
are a little too big now, this doesn't look natural I think.
213

213

00:15:55,674  -->  00:15:59,222
So I will reduce the text for all elements
214

214

00:15:59,222  -->  00:16:02,846
in the footer element so I can say that
215

215

00:16:02,846  -->  00:16:07,556
I want font size to be 80 percent here, for instance,
216

216

00:16:07,556  -->  00:16:11,723
and then everything will get effected inside of this element
217

217

00:16:13,011  -->  00:16:15,594
and just delete this from here.
218

218

00:16:18,141  -->  00:16:22,308
And maybe here we can change it to 170.
219

219

00:16:24,733  -->  00:16:28,900
And so, let's see.
220

220

00:16:31,671  -->  00:16:35,497
These are still a little bit too big
221

221

00:16:35,497  -->  00:16:39,253
but the rest looks good actually the padding here
222

222

00:16:39,253  -->  00:16:43,336
or the margin here is too big as well
223

223

00:16:44,181  -->  00:16:47,848
so let's change that and let's also
224

224

00:16:49,197  -->  00:16:53,186
make these icons a little bit smaller.
225

225

00:16:53,186  -->  00:16:57,353
So maybe 20 pixels is enough here and then 160.
226

226

00:16:58,938  -->  00:17:02,271
And now we're almost at the end of this.
227

227

00:17:04,822  -->  00:17:08,055
So, yeah, I think this was our last change
228

228

00:17:08,055  -->  00:17:10,472
because this looks great now.
229

229

00:17:11,320  -->  00:17:15,487
So let's revisit our whole web page to see what we got here.
230

230

00:17:17,214  -->  00:17:21,498
So this is very cool, we designed all those section
231

231

00:17:21,498  -->  00:17:24,520
and I think you can really be proud of yourself
232

232

00:17:24,520  -->  00:17:26,182
for what you achieved with this.
233

233

00:17:26,182  -->  00:17:27,765
Don't you think so?
234

234

00:17:31,721  -->  00:17:35,221
So we built all of this with our own hands
235

235

00:17:36,988  -->  00:17:39,891
and I think this is really powerful.
236

236

00:17:39,891  -->  00:17:42,141
This is really great stuff.
237

237

00:17:43,501  -->  00:17:45,867
In the next lecture, we will start
238

238

00:17:45,867  -->  00:17:49,274
to make this website be responsive.
239

239

00:17:49,274  -->  00:17:53,441
Because as you see now when we reduce this
240

240

00:17:55,565  -->  00:17:59,232
it starts looking a little bit weird, right?
241

241

00:18:00,772  -->  00:18:02,534
So that is what we are going to
242

242

00:18:02,534  -->  00:18:05,367
be working on in the next lecture.
243

243

00:18:06,220  -->  00:18:09,708
So you can take a break and revisit everything
244

244

00:18:09,708  -->  00:18:11,870
we've done here or you can come with me
245

245

00:18:11,870  -->  00:18:13,537
to the next lecture.
