00:00:01.780  -->  00:00:03.471
<v Voiceover>Hello everyone, it's Jonas</v>
2

2

00:00:03.471  -->  00:00:06.782
and I'm back with another bonus lecture for this course.
3

3

00:00:06.782  -->  00:00:09.841
And I know that many students have been waiting for this one
4

4

00:00:09.841  -->  00:00:12.037
and because in this lecture
5

5

00:00:12.037  -->  00:00:14.844
we will finally make our contact form work
6

6

00:00:14.844  -->  00:00:17.004
using some very simple PHP
7

7

00:00:17.004  -->  00:00:20.171
that I will provide you along the way.
8

8

00:00:21.179  -->  00:00:23.104
So but first let's distinguish here
9

9

00:00:23.104  -->  00:00:27.225
between the client side and the server side code.
10

10

00:00:27.225  -->  00:00:31.832
So far we've been using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
11

11

00:00:31.832  -->  00:00:34.477
which is code that runs in the browser.
12

12

00:00:34.477  -->  00:00:37.518
Which means that it's client side code.
13

13

00:00:37.518  -->  00:00:39.066
Now, on the other hand,
14

14

00:00:39.066  -->  00:00:43.349
we have server side code such as PHP, Microsoft.NET,
15

15

00:00:43.349  -->  00:00:46.228
or the Ruby and Rails framework
16

16

00:00:46.228  -->  00:00:49.018
which is code that is executed on the server.
17

17

00:00:49.018  -->  00:00:53.714
Client side then interacts with the server side.
18

18

00:00:53.714  -->  00:00:57.311
In our example that we will work on in this lecture
19

19

00:00:57.311  -->  00:00:59.920
the browser will send our form data
20

20

00:00:59.920  -->  00:01:03.645
to the PHP script, which is on the server.
21

21

00:01:03.645  -->  00:01:05.823
This script will then send an email
22

22

00:01:05.823  -->  00:01:08.972
and return a success code to the browser.
23

23

00:01:08.972  -->  00:01:11.114
So this means that this will only work
24

24

00:01:11.114  -->  00:01:13.399
if you already have your website hosted
25

25

00:01:13.399  -->  00:01:15.756
on a web server in the internet.
26

26

00:01:15.756  -->  00:01:19.949
So this will really not work on your local computer.
27

27

00:01:19.949  -->  00:01:22.163
So again, you need to have this online
28

28

00:01:22.163  -->  00:01:24.682
in order to make this work.
29

29

00:01:24.682  -->  00:01:26.914
So this is our HTML file
30

30

00:01:26.914  -->  00:01:29.487
and maybe you will notice here on this side
31

31

00:01:29.487  -->  00:01:31.430
I have these small icons now
32

32

00:01:31.430  -->  00:01:32.906
and they're really handy
33

33

00:01:32.906  -->  00:01:35.677
to distinguish between different file types
34

34

00:01:35.677  -->  00:01:38.827
and this is just a small brackets plugin,
35

35

00:01:38.827  -->  00:01:41.328
which is called brackets icons.
36

36

00:01:41.328  -->  00:01:42.983
So you can just install it
37

37

00:01:42.983  -->  00:01:46.650
and see if you like this kind of icons here.
38

38

00:01:47.554  -->  00:01:50.804
So let's just go down here to our form.
39

39

00:01:53.475  -->  00:01:55.142
Yeah, so here it is.
40

40

00:01:58.082  -->  00:02:02.689
So we will use a PHP file, which will be a script
41

41

00:02:02.689  -->  00:02:04.398
hosted on our server,
42

42

00:02:04.398  -->  00:02:07.547
which will be called mailer.php
43

43

00:02:07.547  -->  00:02:10.265
and this is a script that will be executed
44

44

00:02:10.265  -->  00:02:14.265
once the user clicks here on this submit button.
45

45

00:02:16.707  -->  00:02:19.910
So I will now take a look with you at this PHP script.
46

46

00:02:19.910  -->  00:02:23.293
I already wrote this and it's available for downloads
47

47

00:02:23.293  -->  00:02:24.715
right from this lecture.
48

48

00:02:24.715  -->  00:02:26.622
So as this is not a PHP course
49

49

00:02:26.622  -->  00:02:29.286
I will not teach you a step-by-step
50

50

00:02:29.286  -->  00:02:30.995
how to write this code
51

51

00:02:30.995  -->  00:02:34.019
but I will of course go with you through the script
52

52

00:02:34.019  -->  00:02:37.168
so that you understand the basics of it so how it works.
53

53

00:02:37.168  -->  00:02:41.901
So here in this first part we have three variables
54

54

00:02:41.901  -->  00:02:44.407
which will have the name that the user enters
55

55

00:02:44.407  -->  00:02:48.369
into the form, the email address, as well as the message.
56

56

00:02:48.369  -->  00:02:50.187
And these functions here
57

57

00:02:50.187  -->  00:02:53.120
they basically remove the HTML tags
58

58

00:02:53.120  -->  00:02:57.287
and wide space from the variables that the user enters.
59

59

00:02:58.446  -->  00:03:02.855
So and then next here these variables will be checked.
60

60

00:03:02.855  -->  00:03:06.185
So if the name that the user entered is empty
61

61

00:03:06.185  -->  00:03:08.110
or if the message is empty
62

62

00:03:08.110  -->  00:03:11.835
or if the email address is not valid
63

63

00:03:11.835  -->  00:03:15.252
then we will be redirected to our website
64

64

00:03:16.208  -->  00:03:20.581
with this success code here, minus one in this case,
65

65

00:03:20.581  -->  00:03:23.856
and we will see later in the lecture
66

66

00:03:23.856  -->  00:03:25.242
how to handle this.
67

67

00:03:25.242  -->  00:03:28.139
So we will handle this with an error message.
68

68

00:03:28.139  -->  00:03:30.784
And after that this script will be exited
69

69

00:03:30.784  -->  00:03:33.034
and that's it in this case.
70

70

00:03:33.880  -->  00:03:38.414
So this is what happens when there is an error.
71

71

00:03:38.414  -->  00:03:39.247
So in case they're not
72

72

00:03:39.247  -->  00:03:42.011
then the script will be executed further down.
73

73

00:03:42.011  -->  00:03:43.649
So we reach this point here
74

74

00:03:43.649  -->  00:03:46.114
we need to define the next variable
75

75

00:03:46.114  -->  00:03:50.281
which is the email address that we want email to be sent.
76

76

00:03:51.675  -->  00:03:53.798
In this case this is my email address
77

77

00:03:53.798  -->  00:03:56.533
hello@webdesigncourse.co
78

78

00:03:56.533  -->  00:04:00.510
and the next step will be to define the subject
79

79

00:04:00.510  -->  00:04:02.706
of the message that will be sent
80

80

00:04:02.706  -->  00:04:05.171
of the email that will be sent.
81

81

00:04:05.171  -->  00:04:07.367
And next just the simple content.
82

82

00:04:07.367  -->  00:04:10.336
So here we use these variables that we defined before,
83

83

00:04:10.336  -->  00:04:14.086
the name and the email and the actual message
84

84

00:04:15.159  -->  00:04:18.659
so that we can build a nice email from it.
85

85

00:04:19.568  -->  00:04:22.843
Next we need to define email headers.
86

86

00:04:22.843  -->  00:04:26.064
This is something that is part of every email.
87

87

00:04:26.064  -->  00:04:27.486
It's not visible to the user
88

88

00:04:27.486  -->  00:04:30.736
but it's part of an email that is sent.
89

89

00:04:32.056  -->  00:04:35.188
And then finally here is the most important PHP function
90

90

00:04:35.188  -->  00:04:36.355
which is mail.
91

91

00:04:37.221  -->  00:04:41.054
It takes the recipient, so our email address;
92

92

00:04:41.054  -->  00:04:44.743
the subject, the email content, which is this here;
93

93

00:04:44.743  -->  00:04:45.805
and the email header.
94

94

00:04:45.805  -->  00:04:49.044
So these four variables are used by this function
95

95

00:04:49.044  -->  00:04:52.877
and are then sent to hello@webdesigncourse.co.
96

96

00:04:53.846  -->  00:04:56.042
So you will of course update this
97

97

00:04:56.042  -->  00:04:57.194
to the email address
98

98

00:04:57.194  -->  00:05:00.611
that you want the form to send emails to.
99

99

00:05:03.309  -->  00:05:06.441
Actually back here, don't need this.
100

100

00:05:06.441  -->  00:05:10.238
And finally, after sending the email
101

101

00:05:10.238  -->  00:05:12.821
we will redirect to our website
102

102

00:05:14.341  -->  00:05:16.644
this time with the success code one.
103

103

00:05:16.644  -->  00:05:18.570
So this is the success code
104

104

00:05:18.570  -->  00:05:20.441
and not an error code.
105

105

00:05:20.441  -->  00:05:24.346
After that we have this little part here
106

106

00:05:24.346  -->  00:05:28.107
and what this does is to go directly to the place
107

107

00:05:28.107  -->  00:05:31.107
in the website which has an ID form.
108

108

00:05:33.380  -->  00:05:35.845
So let's just quickly add this one
109

109

00:05:35.845  -->  00:05:37.915
in the HTML file.
110

110

00:05:37.915  -->  00:05:40.415
So I'll put this ID right here
111

111

00:05:41.712  -->  00:05:44.462
where I want the code to go then.
112

112

00:05:45.473  -->  00:05:48.223
So probably here is a good place,
113

113

00:05:51.213  -->  00:05:54.057
no, maybe better here actually.
114

114

00:05:54.057  -->  00:05:56.807
So ID will be just four, alright?
115

115

00:06:00.051  -->  00:06:02.197
So as I'm still here on my computer
116

116

00:06:02.197  -->  00:06:03.883
and didn't upload anything yet
117

117

00:06:03.883  -->  00:06:06.466
I'm not able to test it so far.
118

118

00:06:07.350  -->  00:06:11.517
So I will now quickly make the success and the error boxes
119

119

00:06:13.174  -->  00:06:15.147
that I mentioned before
120

120

00:06:15.147  -->  00:06:17.714
so that we can give the user a nice feedback
121

121

00:06:17.714  -->  00:06:20.261
telling them that their mail was sent
122

122

00:06:20.261  -->  00:06:23.863
or that there was some kind of error.
123

123

00:06:23.863  -->  00:06:26.545
So now we'll do that right here
124

124

00:06:26.545  -->  00:06:29.795
at the beginning of the form, actually.
125

125

00:06:31.391  -->  00:06:33.641
So we use a simple div here
126

126

00:06:34.974  -->  00:06:36.974
and I will call this one
127

127

00:06:39.050  -->  00:06:40.217
form messages.
128

128

00:06:43.437  -->  00:06:47.766
And we will do separate classes for the success.
129

129

00:06:47.766  -->  00:06:49.835
So in this case, in the success case
130

130

00:06:49.835  -->  00:06:51.617
we can say something like,
131

131

00:06:51.617  -->  00:06:52.534
"Thank you!
132

132

00:06:54.179  -->  00:06:56.596
"Your message has been sent."
133

133

00:06:59.792  -->  00:07:03.298
And now we can just format this in CSS
134

134

00:07:03.298  -->  00:07:06.440
like you're already used to do.
135

135

00:07:06.440  -->  00:07:09.190
So form messages, messages sorry.
136

136

00:07:13.853  -->  00:07:16.861
Alright, so let's give it some width.
137

137

00:07:16.861  -->  00:07:20.028
Let's say for example 70% for now
138

138

00:07:22.304  -->  00:07:24.387
and we want to center it,
139

139

00:07:26.508  -->  00:07:28.258
margin zero and auto.
140

140

00:07:31.546  -->  00:07:35.213
One more thing that I noticed here right now
141

141

00:07:37.427  -->  00:07:39.630
is this red icon here,
142

142

00:07:39.630  -->  00:07:41.871
this is yet another brackets plugin,
143

143

00:07:41.871  -->  00:07:43.308
a very handy one.
144

144

00:07:43.308  -->  00:07:45.818
It's called the interactive linter.
145

145

00:07:45.818  -->  00:07:48.040
I will just show it to you
146

146

00:07:48.040  -->  00:07:49.572
so you can install it for yourself
147

147

00:07:49.572  -->  00:07:52.676
because I really recommend you to do it.
148

148

00:07:52.676  -->  00:07:55.741
It is this one, interactive linter.
149

149

00:07:55.741  -->  00:07:56.852
So you install it
150

150

00:07:56.852  -->  00:07:59.514
and it will help you avoid bugs in your code.
151

151

00:07:59.514  -->  00:08:02.943
So in this case it knows that I have some mistake here
152

152

00:08:02.943  -->  00:08:05.281
and so it puts this little icon here
153

153

00:08:05.281  -->  00:08:08.281
so I can immediately find the error.
154

154

00:08:10.089  -->  00:08:13.518
And it also gives me this warning icon down here.
155

155

00:08:13.518  -->  00:08:14.629
So this is really great.
156

156

00:08:14.629  -->  00:08:17.598
It's really helpful and it will help you
157

157

00:08:17.598  -->  00:08:20.181
making last mistakes basically.
158

158

00:08:21.638  -->  00:08:24.671
So again back to our code and now the icon is gone.
159

159

00:08:24.671  -->  00:08:26.490
Now everything's fine.
160

160

00:08:26.490  -->  00:08:29.657
So we can continue here with the code.
161

161

00:08:30.916  -->  00:08:33.597
Give it some padding like 10 pixels for now.
162

162

00:08:33.597  -->  00:08:36.854
As always, we design in the browser.
163

163

00:08:36.854  -->  00:08:39.344
We just do some default styling
164

164

00:08:39.344  -->  00:08:41.873
and then after that we see how it looks
165

165

00:08:41.873  -->  00:08:45.456
and then eventually change it if necessary.
166

166

00:08:46.662  -->  00:08:50.329
So we can have a nice border radius as well.
167

167

00:08:52.907  -->  00:08:54.824
Let's say three pixels.
168

168

00:08:59.765  -->  00:09:02.524
And then probably margin to the bottom of
169

169

00:09:02.524  -->  00:09:04.274
I will try 20 pixels.
170

170

00:09:07.236  -->  00:09:09.986
So let's take now a look at this.
171

171

00:09:13.979  -->  00:09:17.479
Alright, so all the website as we know it.
172

172

00:09:19.037  -->  00:09:20.780
And here's our little box.
173

173

00:09:20.780  -->  00:09:24.343
So something doesn't look so good here
174

174

00:09:24.343  -->  00:09:27.926
but let's take care of that later probably.
175

175

00:09:29.088  -->  00:09:32.651
So now I want some background color here.
176

176

00:09:32.651  -->  00:09:36.904
I will say that I want a green color for the success message
177

177

00:09:36.904  -->  00:09:40.487
and a red color for the error box, alright?
178

178

00:09:44.693  -->  00:09:47.860
So let's then define the success class
179

179

00:09:51.225  -->  00:09:55.267
and all we need here is actually the background color.
180

180

00:09:55.267  -->  00:09:56.517
Sorry, success.
181

181

00:09:59.711  -->  00:10:04.098
So the background color and we want a nice little green.
182

182

00:10:04.098  -->  00:10:05.265
So I will just
183

183

00:10:06.914  -->  00:10:11.857
some random color so that I can now hit Control + E,
184

184

00:10:11.857  -->  00:10:13.868
or Command + E on a Mac,
185

185

00:10:13.868  -->  00:10:16.118
to choose that green color.
186

186

00:10:18.427  -->  00:10:21.013
I should probably use one of the tools
187

187

00:10:21.013  -->  00:10:23.734
that I showed you before for choosing this color
188

188

00:10:23.734  -->  00:10:27.316
but right now I will just pick some green color
189

189

00:10:27.316  -->  00:10:29.566
from this color picker here
190

190

00:10:30.956  -->  00:10:35.400
and later if you want you can then adjust it for you,
191

191

00:10:35.400  -->  00:10:37.277
the green color that you like more
192

192

00:10:37.277  -->  00:10:41.444
or that is more suitable for your website, whatever.
193

193

00:10:42.622  -->  00:10:47.296
So let's just see how it looks like with this one.
194

194

00:10:47.296  -->  00:10:51.463
It look like anything at all here what's wrong here?
195

195

00:10:54.786  -->  00:10:56.203
Yeah, here it is.
196

196

00:10:57.334  -->  00:11:00.284
Of course, success was misspelled.
197

197

00:11:00.284  -->  00:11:02.487
So now it should work, alright.
198

198

00:11:02.487  -->  00:11:04.987
So it's a nice green box here.
199

199

00:11:08.042  -->  00:11:10.993
Maybe we could even make it transparent
200

200

00:11:10.993  -->  00:11:12.621
so that the map is still visible.
201

201

00:11:12.621  -->  00:11:14.575
Maybe this looks better.
202

202

00:11:14.575  -->  00:11:17.333
So again, I will hit Command + E
203

203

00:11:17.333  -->  00:11:20.590
and then down here I choose the transparency level,
204

204

00:11:20.590  -->  00:11:22.090
09 could be great.
205

205

00:11:24.230  -->  00:11:25.397
Maybe even 07,
206

206

00:11:28.637  -->  00:11:29.887
just look like.
207

207

00:11:31.076  -->  00:11:33.159
A little too much, so 08.
208

208

00:11:36.899  -->  00:11:39.773
Yeah, let's leave it at that.
209

209

00:11:39.773  -->  00:11:42.570
You can always change it if you feel like it.
210

210

00:11:42.570  -->  00:11:44.313
And now we need the same thing
211

211

00:11:44.313  -->  00:11:47.813
for the error, we'll just call this error.
212

212

00:11:50.462  -->  00:11:54.379
And then here we will use red background color.
213

213

00:12:00.040  -->  00:12:03.207
So again, just pick some random color.
214

214

00:12:04.849  -->  00:12:07.182
And then here some nice red.
215

215

00:12:10.730  -->  00:12:13.730
Alright, and then some transparency.
216

216

00:12:17.762  -->  00:12:20.762
And just to see how this looks like.
217

217

00:12:22.609  -->  00:12:26.026
Or we can actually put the same box below
218

218

00:12:29.409  -->  00:12:32.242
as we will need it later actually.
219

219

00:12:33.356  -->  00:12:35.689
So this could be like, oops.
220

220

00:12:42.148  -->  00:12:43.981
"Something went wrong.
221

221

00:12:45.156  -->  00:12:46.739
"Please try again."
222

222

00:12:49.658  -->  00:12:52.408
So let's take a look at that one.
223

223

00:12:53.393  -->  00:12:54.773
It looks nice actually
224

224

00:12:54.773  -->  00:12:58.523
but the text here should be a littler darker.
225

225

00:13:00.309  -->  00:13:02.991
Actually in both of them.
226

226

00:13:02.991  -->  00:13:05.074
Let's just add color 333,
227

227

00:13:06.535  -->  00:13:09.006
this is a very gray text.
228

228

00:13:09.006  -->  00:13:12.895
Usually this is the most dark text that I ever use.
229

229

00:13:12.895  -->  00:13:16.062
Usually never go darker than this one.
230

230

00:13:18.160  -->  00:13:20.327
Yeah, it looks better now.
231

231

00:13:21.756  -->  00:13:24.860
So now let's just hide one of these one
232

232

00:13:24.860  -->  00:13:29.649
and then we can change the height of this entire row here
233

233

00:13:29.649  -->  00:13:33.816
so that the contact form fits the height of this again.
234

234

00:13:39.476  -->  00:13:42.309
So I'll now comment this code here
235

235

00:13:46.219  -->  00:13:48.537
'cause we don't want to see it for now.
236

236

00:13:48.537  -->  00:13:52.704
And now we can go here to which would be the map box
237

237

00:13:53.805  -->  00:13:55.222
but I'm not sure.
238

238

00:13:56.200  -->  00:13:58.117
Yeah, it's the map box.
239

239

00:13:59.054  -->  00:14:02.234
So I will change the height of it.
240

240

00:14:02.234  -->  00:14:04.234
Let's say to 600 pixels.
241

241

00:14:08.096  -->  00:14:12.770
And then again I will have to change all of these.
242

242

00:14:12.770  -->  00:14:16.141
But we already see that it's not high enough.
243

243

00:14:16.141  -->  00:14:19.641
So let's change it to 650 pixels, alright.
244

244

00:14:21.505  -->  00:14:24.005
And, yeah it looks better now.
245

245

00:14:25.164  -->  00:14:27.581
So let's now increase the map
246

246

00:14:29.574  -->  00:14:30.657
to 650 pixels
247

247

00:14:32.237  -->  00:14:36.070
as well as the form box to 650 pixels as well.
248

248

00:14:39.497  -->  00:14:41.796
Now it looks better.
249

249

00:14:41.796  -->  00:14:46.412
Now let's just for a second look at what's happening here.
250

250

00:14:46.412  -->  00:14:50.052
And probably we should just put this message here
251

251

00:14:50.052  -->  00:14:52.025
into its own row
252

252

00:14:52.025  -->  00:14:56.431
such as we did with each of these elements here.
253

253

00:14:56.431  -->  00:14:59.228
So we have a row for this, for this, for this,
254

254

00:14:59.228  -->  00:15:01.431
and we will now use a row for this one
255

255

00:15:01.431  -->  00:15:05.014
and this will hopefully solve this problem.
256

256

00:15:13.803  -->  00:15:15.779
This, yeah, of course.
257

257

00:15:15.779  -->  00:15:18.946
It should of course not be in this row
258

258

00:15:20.358  -->  00:15:23.608
but instead it should have its own row.
259

259

00:15:30.338  -->  00:15:33.505
And of course this one goes also here.
260

260

00:15:41.334  -->  00:15:44.307
And here we go, it looks much better.
261

261

00:15:44.307  -->  00:15:47.474
And now we have this weird space here.
262

262

00:15:48.847  -->  00:15:50.372
I think it would be best
263

263

00:15:50.372  -->  00:15:52.594
if we actually increased the margin
264

264

00:15:52.594  -->  00:15:54.677
of this message box here.
265

265

00:15:59.835  -->  00:16:02.002
So, let's say to 30 pixels
266

266

00:16:05.026  -->  00:16:07.210
and this was probably a little bit too much.
267

267

00:16:07.210  -->  00:16:09.701
I will increase it just 20 pixels
268

268

00:16:09.701  -->  00:16:12.451
and then take another look at it.
269

269

00:16:15.347  -->  00:16:17.430
Yeah, so now it's better.
270

270

00:16:19.082  -->  00:16:23.165
Now the next step will be to show these two boxes
271

271

00:16:24.235  -->  00:16:27.318
according to the success or the error
272

272

00:16:28.297  -->  00:16:30.380
of the mailer.php script.
273

273

00:16:33.182  -->  00:16:36.017
So if you remember in here
274

274

00:16:36.017  -->  00:16:37.932
we passed this code.
275

275

00:16:37.932  -->  00:16:39.829
This is a variable called success
276

276

00:16:39.829  -->  00:16:43.449
and we define it as minus one if there's an error
277

277

00:16:43.449  -->  00:16:46.032
and as one if there is success.
278

278

00:16:47.530  -->  00:16:50.154
Now what we got to do is to include PHP
279

279

00:16:50.154  -->  00:16:52.817
right into our HTML file
280

280

00:16:52.817  -->  00:16:55.067
and then work with PHP here
281

281

00:16:56.342  -->  00:16:58.621
and how do we do this?
282

282

00:16:58.621  -->  00:17:00.882
We just write like this,
283

283

00:17:00.882  -->  00:17:03.382
PHP and then here we close it.
284

284

00:17:06.265  -->  00:17:08.755
And brackets doesn't like this
285

285

00:17:08.755  -->  00:17:10.288
and it's actually right
286

286

00:17:10.288  -->  00:17:11.973
because now what we have to do
287

287

00:17:11.973  -->  00:17:14.473
is to save this as a PHP file.
288

288

00:17:17.663  -->  00:17:20.019
So as long as you have a piece of PHP
289

289

00:17:20.019  -->  00:17:22.816
inside of your HTML document
290

290

00:17:22.816  -->  00:17:25.316
we need to call it a PHP file.
291

291

00:17:26.168  -->  00:17:30.268
Alright, so the rest of this is still HTML of course
292

292

00:17:30.268  -->  00:17:33.851
but now we have a little piece of PHP here.
293

293

00:17:36.475  -->  00:17:38.409
So now these comments are no longer valid
294

294

00:17:38.409  -->  00:17:41.647
because these are HTML comments
295

295

00:17:41.647  -->  00:17:43.397
and not PHP comments.
296

296

00:17:45.114  -->  00:17:46.551
Alright, so what do we do here?
297

297

00:17:46.551  -->  00:17:49.961
We say that if the success is one
298

298

00:17:49.961  -->  00:17:52.374
then we want this message here to show
299

299

00:17:52.374  -->  00:17:54.654
and if the success is minus one
300

300

00:17:54.654  -->  00:17:57.872
we want this message to show.
301

301

00:17:57.872  -->  00:17:58.944
So how do we do that?
302

302

00:17:58.944  -->  00:18:00.027
We just write
303

303

00:18:03.044  -->  00:18:03.877
"If
304

304

00:18:06.613  -->  00:18:07.446
get
305

305

00:18:09.649  -->  00:18:10.982
success is one."
306

306

00:18:15.300  -->  00:18:17.254
so again, I will not worry here
307

307

00:18:17.254  -->  00:18:18.837
about syntax things
308

308

00:18:19.820  -->  00:18:23.987
because that is not my goal with this course for you.
309

309

00:18:24.877  -->  00:18:28.191
Alright, so I will just show you how to do this.
310

310

00:18:28.191  -->  00:18:32.358
And to display packs with PHP we used the echo function
311

311

00:18:34.149  -->  00:18:38.316
and now inside of this echo we will put all of this text.
312

312

00:18:47.225  -->  00:18:51.554
And all of this text needs to be in quotes
313

313

00:18:51.554  -->  00:18:53.776
and then a semicolon after it.
314

314

00:18:53.776  -->  00:18:56.075
Since we also have to quotes here
315

315

00:18:56.075  -->  00:18:57.435
we have to escape it,
316

316

00:18:57.435  -->  00:18:59.657
this is how it calls in PHP,
317

317

00:18:59.657  -->  00:19:02.240
and for that we use this slash.
318

318

00:19:04.561  -->  00:19:08.728
So this way PHP doesn't interpret it as a real quote.
319

319

00:19:12.531  -->  00:19:14.561
So if the success is one
320

320

00:19:14.561  -->  00:19:18.728
then this HTML line will be outputted by the code.
321

321

00:19:25.021  -->  00:19:28.086
And now we just have to do the same thing
322

322

00:19:28.086  -->  00:19:30.557
for the minus one part.
323

323

00:19:30.557  -->  00:19:32.338
So if it's minus one
324

324

00:19:32.338  -->  00:19:34.255
then we want this text.
325

325

00:19:38.832  -->  00:19:41.749
And here we need to change to error
326

326

00:19:53.372  -->  00:19:54.955
from a code nicely.
327

327

00:19:59.464  -->  00:20:01.533
And yeah, that should be it probably.
328

328

00:20:01.533  -->  00:20:03.616
So I will now upload this
329

329

00:20:05.613  -->  00:20:09.195
with this extension that I showed you before
330

330

00:20:09.195  -->  00:20:12.695
and now we just need to wait a little bit.
331

331

00:20:14.578  -->  00:20:16.073
Alright, here we go,
332

332

00:20:16.073  -->  00:20:18.850
and now I'm ready to open it.
333

333

00:20:18.850  -->  00:20:19.767
Here we go.
334

334

00:20:24.750  -->  00:20:27.701
So now it's time to test the thing.
335

335

00:20:27.701  -->  00:20:29.674
So something is wrong here
336

336

00:20:29.674  -->  00:20:32.049
and there's actually a good reason for it.
337

337

00:20:32.049  -->  00:20:34.731
Because what we want to do now,
338

338

00:20:34.731  -->  00:20:36.608
what we want to open here,
339

339

00:20:36.608  -->  00:20:38.441
is the index.php file.
340

340

00:20:40.305  -->  00:20:44.367
The problem here is that they are both .php
341

341

00:20:44.367  -->  00:20:46.570
and the .html file on the server
342

342

00:20:46.570  -->  00:20:48.753
so now we would need to go ahead
343

343

00:20:48.753  -->  00:20:51.170
and delete the old .html file
344

344

00:20:53.198  -->  00:20:55.324
and then everything will just work fine.
345

345

00:20:55.324  -->  00:20:57.067
I will not do that now.
346

346

00:20:57.067  -->  00:20:59.749
I will just open it like this
347

347

00:20:59.749  -->  00:21:03.619
so I directly opened the index.php file
348

348

00:21:03.619  -->  00:21:04.902
that I want.
349

349

00:21:04.902  -->  00:21:06.971
And everything looks the same of course
350

350

00:21:06.971  -->  00:21:09.721
but now down here it looks great.
351

351

00:21:10.822  -->  00:21:15.515
So this bug that you had before is now no longer here.
352

352

00:21:15.515  -->  00:21:18.465
So that's just try this out.
353

353

00:21:18.465  -->  00:21:21.722
So here just some random email
354

354

00:21:21.722  -->  00:21:23.055
and, "Hey test."
355

355

00:21:27.239  -->  00:21:30.323
And now there is actually some bug in the code
356

356

00:21:30.323  -->  00:21:31.779
as we can obviously see.
357

357

00:21:31.779  -->  00:21:33.216
So nothing's happening.
358

358

00:21:33.216  -->  00:21:36.973
So I will just go back and check my,
359

359

00:21:36.973  -->  00:21:39.640
I'm sorry, and check my PHP file
360

360

00:21:42.088  -->  00:21:45.440
and yeah, what I immediately see that here
361

361

00:21:45.440  -->  00:21:47.523
is the semicolon missing.
362

362

00:21:50.364  -->  00:21:54.531
So now I will just load this again, and here we go.
363

363

00:21:55.747  -->  00:21:57.413
So let's test the thing now
364

364

00:21:57.413  -->  00:22:01.580
and hopefully everything will work just fine right now.
365

365

00:22:05.574  -->  00:22:07.491
So, "Hey test message."
366

366

00:22:12.355  -->  00:22:15.765
Alright, so this message got sent.
367

367

00:22:15.765  -->  00:22:19.932
So no error here and everything worked as expected.
368

368

00:22:21.071  -->  00:22:23.654
So down here we have our email.
369

369

00:22:25.133  -->  00:22:27.891
So name Jonas, email testedtest
370

370

00:22:27.891  -->  00:22:30.228
and message, hey test message.
371

371

00:22:30.228  -->  00:22:34.060
This is exactly the text that we put here
372

372

00:22:34.060  -->  00:22:35.227
in our script.
373

373

00:22:37.620  -->  00:22:40.220
You see the subject is new contact from name,
374

374

00:22:40.220  -->  00:22:42.887
which is Jonas, and then we have
375

375

00:22:43.764  -->  00:22:47.212
the name, the email, the message
376

376

00:22:47.212  -->  00:22:51.120
exactly as we have here in the script.
377

377

00:22:51.120  -->  00:22:54.338
So, I hope you can make this work for you now.
378

378

00:22:54.338  -->  00:22:57.231
I know that this was an important part
379

379

00:22:57.231  -->  00:22:58.481
for many of you
380

380

00:22:59.434  -->  00:23:02.461
so you had a great website and a good looking form
381

381

00:23:02.461  -->  00:23:04.127
but it didn't work,
382

382

00:23:04.127  -->  00:23:05.813
and now you can make it work.
383

383

00:23:05.813  -->  00:23:08.208
So if you have any questions about that
384

384

00:23:08.208  -->  00:23:11.637
or if anything doesn't work or, I don't know,
385

385

00:23:11.637  -->  00:23:14.549
if you face some kind of problem
386

386

00:23:14.549  -->  00:23:16.426
