00:00:02,093  -->  00:00:02,926
<v Voiceover>Now that we have</v>
2

2

00:00:02,926  -->  00:00:04,867
our super text editor installed,
3

3

00:00:04,867  -->  00:00:06,700
let's talk about HTML.
4

4

00:00:07,586  -->  00:00:12,207
Now, this HTML section together with the CSS section
5

5

00:00:12,207  -->  00:00:15,992
is designed to get you started for our big web page project
6

6

00:00:15,992  -->  00:00:18,430
that we will be working on later.
7

7

00:00:18,430  -->  00:00:21,657
Here, we will just cover some very basic things,
8

8

00:00:21,657  -->  00:00:23,910
like the structure of any web page,
9

9

00:00:23,910  -->  00:00:27,904
how to use headings, paragraphs, images, and links
10

10

00:00:27,904  -->  00:00:29,904
just to get you started.
11

11

00:00:31,688  -->  00:00:34,103
But let me first show you what we'll build
12

12

00:00:34,103  -->  00:00:38,270
in this section and in the next one using HTML and CSS.
13

13

00:00:39,490  -->  00:00:43,657
It's a very, very simple, fake blog post web page.
14

14

00:00:44,574  -->  00:00:48,741
But it looks pretty cool for a first web page, right?
15

15

00:00:50,044  -->  00:00:52,761
So, starting with HTML.
16

16

00:00:52,761  -->  00:00:55,344
But first of all, what is HTML?
17

17

00:00:56,267  -->  00:01:00,447
HTML stands for hyper text markup language.
18

18

00:01:00,447  -->  00:01:02,119
So it's a markup language and
19

19

00:01:02,119  -->  00:01:05,119
not actually a programming language.
20

20

00:01:07,297  -->  00:01:11,523
HTML documents are described by HTML tags
21

21

00:01:11,523  -->  00:01:14,147
like these three you see here.
22

22

00:01:14,147  -->  00:01:18,163
Each HTML tag describes a different type of content
23

23

00:01:18,163  -->  00:01:21,413
such as headings, paragraphs, or links.
24

24

00:01:22,297  -->  00:01:26,464
We use tags to markup the beginning and end of an element.
25

25

00:01:27,702  -->  00:01:30,906
Each element is written with an opening tag
26

26

00:01:30,906  -->  00:01:35,272
and a closing tag, with the content in between.
27

27

00:01:35,272  -->  00:01:37,570
So the closing tag is just the same as
28

28

00:01:37,570  -->  00:01:40,320
the opening tag but with a slash.
29

29

00:01:41,471  -->  00:01:45,638
We will see all of that when we start real coding.
30

30

00:01:46,858  -->  00:01:50,040
And web browsers such as Google Chrome
31

31

00:01:50,040  -->  00:01:52,849
can read HTML files we code
32

32

00:01:52,849  -->  00:01:56,349
and translate them into visible web pages.
33

33

00:01:57,637  -->  00:02:00,841
All right, now that we know what HTML is,
34

34

00:02:00,841  -->  00:02:05,008
we can move on to some real coding in the next lecture.
