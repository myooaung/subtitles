<v Voiceover>Hi, there.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,252  -->  00:00:06,419
This is Part Two of Building the how-it-works section
3

3

00:00:07,699  -->  00:00:11,151
and this is what we're gonna format in this lecture.
4

4

00:00:11,151  -->  00:00:14,484
So let's start with these two step boxes
5

5

00:00:15,443  -->  00:00:19,639
and of course make this image here smaller.
6

6

00:00:19,639  -->  00:00:22,639
Okay, so right back to the CSS file.
7

7

00:00:24,553  -->  00:00:26,803
Let me grab a copy of this.
8

8

00:00:29,138  -->  00:00:30,555
And how it works.
9

9

00:00:34,512  -->  00:00:37,262
So, I'll start with the steps box
10

10

00:00:40,362  -->  00:00:42,112
cause as you remember
11

11

00:00:43,783  -->  00:00:44,616
those are
12

12

00:00:46,325  -->  00:00:47,158
the two boxes
13

13

00:00:47,158  -->  00:00:49,741
the left one and the right one.
14

14

00:00:50,823  -->  00:00:52,298
Okay?
15

15

00:00:52,298  -->  00:00:55,631
So let's first put a margin between them
16

16

00:00:57,528  -->  00:00:58,861
and the h2 title
17

17

00:01:00,128  -->  00:01:03,795
somewhere at the top of let's say 30 pixels.
18

18

00:01:05,854  -->  00:01:10,143
And now we need to select each of the boxes individually
19

19

00:01:10,143  -->  00:01:12,875
and in order to do that I will show you a new
20

20

00:01:12,875  -->  00:01:15,845
very, very useful selector
21

21

00:01:15,845  -->  00:01:17,872
and it's this one.
22

22

00:01:17,872  -->  00:01:20,122
It's actually a zero class
23

23

00:01:21,251  -->  00:01:22,888
and it's this one.
24

24

00:01:22,888  -->  00:01:23,888
First-child.
25

25

00:01:26,490  -->  00:01:29,157
So this will select the first of
26

26

00:01:30,652  -->  00:01:32,044
these step boxes.
27

27

00:01:32,044  -->  00:01:35,044
Which is, in our case, the left one.
28

28

00:01:35,899  -->  00:01:38,399
And there's also a similar one
29

29

00:01:39,522  -->  00:01:41,522
which is the last-child.
30

30

00:01:43,532  -->  00:01:46,949
So these are two very useful zero classes
31

31

00:01:48,512  -->  00:01:51,330
and actually in the course e-book you can find
32

32

00:01:51,330  -->  00:01:54,111
a link to an article which has, I think,
33

33

00:01:54,111  -->  00:01:57,611
30 very useful selectors such as this one.
34

34

00:01:59,020  -->  00:02:02,833
Alright, so in the first box we want the text
35

35

00:02:02,833  -->  00:02:05,333
align to be to the right side.
36

36

00:02:06,686  -->  00:02:09,081
Now you may ask, "We don't have any text there."
37

37

00:02:09,081  -->  00:02:11,028
And that's actually right.
38

38

00:02:11,028  -->  00:02:14,196
But the text align property doesn't work only for text
39

39

00:02:14,196  -->  00:02:17,927
it actually does work for all in line, or
40

40

00:02:17,927  -->  00:02:21,301
in line block elements and the image is one of
41

41

00:02:21,301  -->  00:02:23,019
those inline block elements.
42

42

00:02:23,019  -->  00:02:25,378
And so, it will then be aligned to the
43

43

00:02:25,378  -->  00:02:27,295
right side of this box.
44

44

00:02:28,390  -->  00:02:32,847
And I also want to add a heading to the right side
45

45

00:02:32,847  -->  00:02:34,264
of three percent.
46

46

00:02:35,459  -->  00:02:38,078
And now you maybe feel a little confused
47

47

00:02:38,078  -->  00:02:41,635
why I'm adding this heading with a percentage
48

48

00:02:41,635  -->  00:02:44,969
instead of adding pixels, and there's a simple reason
49

49

00:02:44,969  -->  00:02:47,739
for that and it has to do with responsive web design
50

50

00:02:47,739  -->  00:02:51,019
where we want our layout to be fluid,
51

51

00:02:51,019  -->  00:02:52,080
and as I explained to you before,
52

52

00:02:52,080  -->  00:02:56,100
fluid means that we have all our layout properties
53

53

00:02:56,100  -->  00:03:00,100
defined in percentages instead of ridged pixels.
54

54

00:03:02,053  -->  00:03:04,477
So let's do the same thing with the other box
55

55

00:03:04,477  -->  00:03:07,208
and here we will say that we want a padding
56

56

00:03:07,208  -->  00:03:11,275
to the left side of three percent as well.
57

57

00:03:11,275  -->  00:03:12,775
And now let's take
58

58

00:03:14,474  -->  00:03:16,219
what else we have, so the image,
59

59

00:03:16,219  -->  00:03:17,636
I want the image.
60

60

00:03:19,033  -->  00:03:22,099
And it's called app-screen, so we already have a
61

61

00:03:22,099  -->  00:03:23,999
class name here.
62

62

00:03:23,999  -->  00:03:26,718
So let's say app-screen
63

63

00:03:26,718  -->  00:03:28,301
and let's say width
64

64

00:03:31,250  -->  00:03:33,330
let's say 40 percent.
65

65

00:03:33,330  -->  00:03:35,209
And again on defining the width
66

66

00:03:35,209  -->  00:03:37,626
with a percentage of the box.
67

67

00:03:38,584  -->  00:03:42,076
So let's see what it looks like now.
68

68

00:03:42,076  -->  00:03:44,681
Alright, this looks quite good, right?
69

69

00:03:44,681  -->  00:03:48,914
So we have a nice distance between the image and the text
70

70

00:03:48,914  -->  00:03:52,164
and I think the image size is okay now.
71

71

00:03:53,252  -->  00:03:56,151
So the next thing is we want to format
72

72

00:03:56,151  -->  00:03:57,591
those numbers here.
73

73

00:03:57,591  -->  00:04:00,638
As you remember, we want this to be a circle
74

74

00:04:00,638  -->  00:04:03,190
with a number inside of the circle,
75

75

00:04:03,190  -->  00:04:05,763
and we also want some distance, some space,
76

76

00:04:05,763  -->  00:04:09,930
of course, between each of these work steps elements.
77

77

00:04:13,025  -->  00:04:15,221
So let's start doing this.
78

78

00:04:15,221  -->  00:04:16,138
Works-step.
79

79

00:04:18,993  -->  00:04:22,993
And margin to the bottom, I would say 50 pixels.
80

80

00:04:28,293  -->  00:04:31,210
And again, let's take our HTML file
81

81

00:04:33,774  -->  00:04:36,298
so we want to select the div element
82

82

00:04:36,298  -->  00:04:38,681
inside of a work-steps,
83

83

00:04:38,681  -->  00:04:41,348
because that will be our number.
84

84

00:04:43,288  -->  00:04:44,664
So,
85

85

00:04:44,664  -->  00:04:45,914
works-step div.
86

86

00:04:49,123  -->  00:04:51,680
And what are we gonna do?
87

87

00:04:51,680  -->  00:04:54,680
First let's set its color to orange.
88

88

00:04:56,910  -->  00:05:00,414
And we already know where that is.
89

89

00:05:00,414  -->  00:05:01,445
It's
90

90

00:05:01,445  -->  00:05:02,278
up here.
91

91

00:05:05,299  -->  00:05:07,466
Then we also want a border
92

92

00:05:09,534  -->  00:05:12,814
and I will use two pixels here
93

93

00:05:12,814  -->  00:05:15,050
such as in other elements on the website,
94

94

00:05:15,050  -->  00:05:17,933
so it'll keep some consistency here.
95

95

00:05:17,933  -->  00:05:21,016
And here with the same color as well.
96

96

00:05:25,570  -->  00:05:29,167
And I want to display it as an in-line box, so
97

97

00:05:29,167  -->  00:05:32,446
this very much used property display,
98

98

00:05:32,446  -->  00:05:35,551
and I want the inline-blocks because that way
99

99

00:05:35,551  -->  00:05:39,718
we can ensure that the element doesn't force a line break
100

100

00:05:40,591  -->  00:05:44,758
and so the number can be side by side with the text.
101

101

00:05:47,166  -->  00:05:49,583
So let's just check that out.
102

102

00:05:50,498  -->  00:05:51,331
Okay, great.
103

103

00:05:51,331  -->  00:05:54,609
So we have some distance here now and
104

104

00:05:54,609  -->  00:05:55,609
so now let's
105

105

00:05:56,471  -->  00:05:59,073
continue formatting this.
106

106

00:05:59,073  -->  00:06:02,941
It's now a square and we want it to be a circle.
107

107

00:06:02,941  -->  00:06:05,793
And you probably remember how to do it.
108

108

00:06:05,793  -->  00:06:08,460
That's border-radius 50 percent.
109

109

00:06:12,222  -->  00:06:15,156
And we can now define the height
110

110

00:06:15,156  -->  00:06:18,236
of that element, let's say 50 pixel.
111

111

00:06:18,236  -->  00:06:19,499
And the width.
112

112

00:06:19,499  -->  00:06:22,180
Of course, if we want it to be a circle
113

113

00:06:22,180  -->  00:06:25,013
it has to be as high as it's wide.
114

114

00:06:26,015  -->  00:06:27,883
And inside of this box,
115

115

00:06:27,883  -->  00:06:31,135
the number should be centered.
116

116

00:06:31,135  -->  00:06:32,968
So, text-align center.
117

117

00:06:34,022  -->  00:06:36,022
So let's check this out.
118

118

00:06:37,447  -->  00:06:40,734
Alright, it's already circular.
119

119

00:06:40,734  -->  00:06:43,339
We will now increase the font size of this
120

120

00:06:43,339  -->  00:06:45,422
and give it some padding.
121

121

00:06:46,580  -->  00:06:48,463
So, you see this is now really
122

122

00:06:48,463  -->  00:06:50,495
designing in the browser.
123

123

00:06:50,495  -->  00:06:53,504
One thing that is also left to do is
124

124

00:06:53,504  -->  00:06:54,921
to make this text
125

125

00:06:56,952  -->  00:06:58,915
appear here on the side,
126

126

00:06:58,915  -->  00:07:01,101
and in order to do that we need to define
127

127

00:07:01,101  -->  00:07:03,934
a float property for that element.
128

128

00:07:06,075  -->  00:07:08,887
So some padding, as I said,
129

129

00:07:08,887  -->  00:07:11,968
I would say like five pixels
130

130

00:07:11,968  -->  00:07:15,385
and then let's make it float to the left.
131

131

00:07:16,601  -->  00:07:20,141
So you see we have a whole lot of properties here
132

132

00:07:20,141  -->  00:07:22,141
for this little element.
133

133

00:07:24,813  -->  00:07:26,491
The other thing is the font-size.
134

134

00:07:26,491  -->  00:07:28,324
Let's say 150 percent.
135

135

00:07:32,330  -->  00:07:33,966
Alright.
136

136

00:07:33,966  -->  00:07:37,733
Okay this looks already quite good, right?
137

137

00:07:37,733  -->  00:07:40,140
Now what I would do now is to
138

138

00:07:40,140  -->  00:07:42,708
define some margin to the right here
139

139

00:07:42,708  -->  00:07:46,603
and maybe increase the size of those circles.
140

140

00:07:46,603  -->  00:07:48,603
So, a margin to the left
141

141

00:07:49,994  -->  00:07:51,077
of 25 pixels.
142

142

00:07:52,873  -->  00:07:55,735
It then increases here to let's say
143

143

00:07:55,735  -->  00:07:56,568
54.
144

144

00:07:58,320  -->  00:07:59,570
Or 55 actually.
145

145

00:08:00,479  -->  00:08:03,729
It really doesn't matter for one pixel.
146

146

00:08:04,747  -->  00:08:07,879
Okay, this is obviously margin to the right
147

147

00:08:07,879  -->  00:08:09,212
not to the left.
148

148

00:08:10,427  -->  00:08:11,260
Okay.
149

149

00:08:12,184  -->  00:08:13,851
So, this looks cool.
150

150

00:08:15,234  -->  00:08:17,793
Now we probably should add some more space
151

151

00:08:17,793  -->  00:08:21,687
between this and here at the h2 element
152

152

00:08:21,687  -->  00:08:24,292
because it doesn't look quite aligned right now.
153

153

00:08:24,292  -->  00:08:26,327
We want the phone to be more aligned
154

154

00:08:26,327  -->  00:08:28,227
with this text here.
155

155

00:08:28,227  -->  00:08:32,045
And so let's increase the margin for
156

156

00:08:32,045  -->  00:08:34,295
this box on the right side.
157

157

00:08:36,265  -->  00:08:40,987
So we already defined that there is a margin-top 30
158

158

00:08:40,987  -->  00:08:43,711
but we actually want this
159

159

00:08:43,711  -->  00:08:46,628
second box to have a larger margin.
160

160

00:08:48,135  -->  00:08:50,552
So let's say maybe 70 pixels.
161

161

00:08:52,276  -->  00:08:55,888
And so we can cut this and put it here.
162

162

00:08:55,888  -->  00:08:57,444
So the first one will have 30 and
163

163

00:08:57,444  -->  00:09:00,129
the second will have 70 pixels.
164

164

00:09:00,129  -->  00:09:03,212
And so I don't need this one anymore.
165

165

00:09:05,020  -->  00:09:06,103
And, alright.
166

166

00:09:07,455  -->  00:09:08,288
Great.
167

167

00:09:09,454  -->  00:09:13,144
And now one thing left to do is to format
168

168

00:09:13,144  -->  00:09:14,727
these buttons here.
169

169

00:09:16,064  -->  00:09:18,257
You want them of course to be the same size
170

170

00:09:18,257  -->  00:09:20,979
and this one is way too big.
171

171

00:09:20,979  -->  00:09:23,062
So let's do that as well.
172

172

00:09:24,876  -->  00:09:26,209
We can just say,
173

173

00:09:28,023  -->  00:09:29,835
well I better check the HTML because
174

174

00:09:29,835  -->  00:09:31,918
I don't remember exactly.
175

175

00:09:32,873  -->  00:09:35,630
Okay, so we have the button-app
176

176

00:09:35,630  -->  00:09:38,240
and now we want to style the image inside
177

177

00:09:38,240  -->  00:09:40,240
of the button-app class.
178

178

00:09:42,195  -->  00:09:43,695
So buttom-app img.
179

179

00:09:46,990  -->  00:09:50,125
And we want to set height for them.
180

180

00:09:50,125  -->  00:09:52,733
Let's say 50 pixels so that they
181

181

00:09:52,733  -->  00:09:53,900
look the same.
182

182

00:09:55,991  -->  00:10:00,985
So the width is then defined automatically, of course.
183

183

00:10:00,985  -->  00:10:04,565
And let's set a margin between them.
184

184

00:10:04,565  -->  00:10:07,945
So set a margin to the right side
185

185

00:10:07,945  -->  00:10:09,112
of ten pixels.
186

186

00:10:13,033  -->  00:10:14,950
And let's check it out.
187

187

00:10:16,490  -->  00:10:19,407
Great, now they look quite similar.
188

188

00:10:21,359  -->  00:10:24,526
Now it's time to add some margin here.
189

189

00:10:26,729  -->  00:10:30,393
So that these two are not so close to the text.
190

190

00:10:30,393  -->  00:10:33,034
We want them to be more like here at the
191

191

00:10:33,034  -->  00:10:34,701
bottom of the phone.
192

192

00:10:35,550  -->  00:10:38,072
So in order to do that I ill actually show you
193

193

00:10:38,072  -->  00:10:39,239
a new selector
194

194

00:10:40,464  -->  00:10:42,990
cause what I want to do here is to add
195

195

00:10:42,990  -->  00:10:45,573
a space to the left work-steps.
196

196

00:10:47,143  -->  00:10:50,194
So I'll do that here, and I'll say
197

197

00:10:50,194  -->  00:10:51,027
works-step
198

198

00:10:53,298  -->  00:10:55,965
and then I'll say, last-of-type.
199

199

00:10:58,010  -->  00:11:02,040
This is quite similar to last-child but so
200

200

00:11:02,040  -->  00:11:04,522
in order that you get to know last-of-type
201

201

00:11:04,522  -->  00:11:07,105
as well I'll show you this too.
202

202

00:11:08,088  -->  00:11:12,255
So now I say that I want a larger margin here to the bottom.
203

203

00:11:15,480  -->  00:11:18,563
And in this case I will say 80 pixels
204

204

00:11:19,855  -->  00:11:22,085
instead of those 50.
205

205

00:11:22,085  -->  00:11:24,503
So the work-steps all have 50 pixels, but now
206

206

00:11:24,503  -->  00:11:28,003
I stated the last one will have 80 pixels.
207

207

00:11:30,349  -->  00:11:31,349
Okay, right.
208

208

00:11:33,405  -->  00:11:34,840
For now this looks very good.
209

209

00:11:34,840  -->  00:11:36,813
Don't you think so?
210

210

00:11:36,813  -->  00:11:39,631
But there is however a problem now,
211

211

00:11:39,631  -->  00:11:40,606
which is this.
212

212

00:11:40,606  -->  00:11:43,249
You see, that even though we defined
213

213

00:11:43,249  -->  00:11:46,740
that a section should have 80 percent padding
214

214

00:11:46,740  -->  00:11:49,218
there seems to be no padding here between this
215

215

00:11:49,218  -->  00:11:52,177
section and this one, right?
216

216

00:11:52,177  -->  00:11:54,130
And there's actually a good reason for that
217

217

00:11:54,130  -->  00:11:57,014
and I will use the Chrome developer tools to
218

218

00:11:57,014  -->  00:11:58,181
show you that.
219

219

00:12:01,110  -->  00:12:04,610
So let's start by inspecting this element.
220

220

00:12:11,188  -->  00:12:12,521
It's right here.
221

221

00:12:15,527  -->  00:12:18,101
So the section steps which is the selected one
222

222

00:12:18,101  -->  00:12:21,438
is the blue one, and we will see that the section
223

223

00:12:21,438  -->  00:12:23,297
starts right here.
224

224

00:12:23,297  -->  00:12:27,278
So the steps section starts where the meal section
225

225

00:12:27,278  -->  00:12:28,278
should start
226

226

00:12:29,911  -->  00:12:32,407
and you actually see the green area
227

227

00:12:32,407  -->  00:12:34,751
is those 80 pixels padding
228

228

00:12:34,751  -->  00:12:37,918
and it starts at a weird place, right?
229

229

00:12:38,814  -->  00:12:41,015
But there is actually a good reason for that
230

230

00:12:41,015  -->  00:12:44,423
and it has to do with clearing the floats.
231

231

00:12:44,423  -->  00:12:47,968
Maybe you remember that from the introductory lectures?
232

232

00:12:47,968  -->  00:12:51,498
Where I told you that, when you define some floats
233

233

00:12:51,498  -->  00:12:54,479
you then later have to clear those floats
234

234

00:12:54,479  -->  00:12:57,396
and we didn't do any of those here.
235

235

00:12:58,375  -->  00:13:01,189
So the section meals actually has
236

236

00:13:01,189  -->  00:13:04,856
as you can see up there, zero pixels height.
237

237

00:13:06,107  -->  00:13:09,187
That's because we didn't clear the floats.
238

238

00:13:09,187  -->  00:13:12,687
So we need to take care of that right now.
239

239

00:13:13,816  -->  00:13:15,733
And so we go back here.
240

240

00:13:16,822  -->  00:13:17,655
And yeah.
241

241

00:13:17,655  -->  00:13:21,335
The LivePreview was canceled because, as I told you before
242

242

00:13:21,335  -->  00:13:25,191
when you open the Google Chrome developer tools
243

243

00:13:25,191  -->  00:13:29,358
in this live window then the connection gets lost.
244

244

00:13:31,078  -->  00:13:32,666
Now clearing those floats,
245

245

00:13:32,666  -->  00:13:35,249
I will now show you a new class
246

246

00:13:37,948  -->  00:13:41,160
which is very used in web design.
247

247

00:13:41,160  -->  00:13:43,143
In web development.
248

248

00:13:43,143  -->  00:13:46,107
And it's called a clearfix class.
249

249

00:13:46,107  -->  00:13:48,107
And I will define it now
250

250

00:13:49,003  -->  00:13:52,003
but don't worry about understanding
251

251

00:13:53,699  -->  00:13:56,282
exactly what I'm gonna do here.
252

252

00:13:57,126  -->  00:14:00,709
We just use this class to clear the floats.
253

253

00:14:03,420  -->  00:14:07,003
And the actual clearing happens right here.
254

254

00:14:08,667  -->  00:14:11,084
So let me just complete this.
255

255

00:14:13,696  -->  00:14:16,330
So again, don't worry so much about
256

256

00:14:16,330  -->  00:14:17,913
understanding this.
257

257

00:14:19,771  -->  00:14:22,269
Visibility is hidden.
258

258

00:14:22,269  -->  00:14:24,746
Okay, what this class will do,
259

259

00:14:24,746  -->  00:14:28,163
it will clear the float after an element.
260

260

00:14:30,207  -->  00:14:33,040
So we will actually add this class
261

261

00:14:35,556  -->  00:14:36,806
here in the ul.
262

262

00:14:37,761  -->  00:14:40,738
And I will explain to you why.
263

263

00:14:40,738  -->  00:14:44,462
This is because the child elements of this class
264

264

00:14:44,462  -->  00:14:47,852
which are the li elements, are the one who have
265

265

00:14:47,852  -->  00:14:51,935
the float property, and so we say that the parent
266

266

00:14:53,013  -->  00:14:56,901
has this clearfix class and then that float
267

267

00:14:56,901  -->  00:15:00,484
will be cleared right after the ul element.
268

268

00:15:02,150  -->  00:15:04,586
And we do that here and we do that here.
269

269

00:15:04,586  -->  00:15:07,022
And now the problem should be solved.
270

270

00:15:07,022  -->  00:15:10,189
So let's open up the connection again.
271

271

00:15:11,444  -->  00:15:13,277
And close the old one.
272

272

00:15:15,507  -->  00:15:17,450
And here we are.
273

273

00:15:17,450  -->  00:15:20,413
So this works, now we have our space here
274

274

00:15:20,413  -->  00:15:21,996
such as we want to.
275

275

00:15:23,583  -->  00:15:25,250
We can confirm this.
276

276

00:15:27,476  -->  00:15:29,059
This section meals.
277

277

00:15:31,540  -->  00:15:35,081
And now the section meals no longer has zero pixels height
278

278

00:15:35,081  -->  00:15:38,414
but it has its actual 546 pixels height.
279

279

00:15:39,992  -->  00:15:42,659
And everything works just right.
280

280

00:15:43,743  -->  00:15:46,332
So one other thing to do that I
281

281

00:15:46,332  -->  00:15:49,132
told you at the beginning of this lecture,
282

282

00:15:49,132  -->  00:15:51,382
is to create a good way to
283

283

00:15:52,731  -->  00:15:54,959
separate between different sections.
284

284

00:15:54,959  -->  00:15:57,687
And what I want to do here
285

285

00:15:57,687  -->  00:16:01,520
is to add a very, very subtle background color
286

286

00:16:04,192  -->  00:16:06,065
to this section.
287

287

00:16:06,065  -->  00:16:07,898
So it's section-steps.
288

288

00:16:12,569  -->  00:16:14,319
And background-color.
289

289

00:16:16,159  -->  00:16:18,492
And I will start with white.
290

290

00:16:22,245  -->  00:16:26,412
And so as I said, I want a very subtle effect here.
291

291

00:16:28,877  -->  00:16:30,544
So such as this one.
292

292

00:16:32,124  -->  00:16:35,297
And you will not notice it right now.
293

293

00:16:35,297  -->  00:16:36,801
The live connection was lost again,
294

294

00:16:36,801  -->  00:16:38,218
I don't know why.
295

295

00:16:42,215  -->  00:16:43,965
So this one is white,
296

296

00:16:45,254  -->  00:16:49,063
and this has a very subtle grey color.
297

297

00:16:49,063  -->  00:16:51,139
And you will not notice it so much now,
298

298

00:16:51,139  -->  00:16:53,385
but you will notice the difference once we design
299

299

00:16:53,385  -->  00:16:57,717
out next section and it will have a greyed effect.
300

300

00:16:57,717  -->  00:17:00,484
So now we have four sections designed,
301

301

00:17:00,484  -->  00:17:04,495
and it's already starting to look very promising I think.
302

302

00:17:04,495  -->  00:17:07,469
And so in the next lecture we're starting with
303

303

00:17:07,469  -->  00:17:08,886
our city section.
304

304

00:17:10,266  -->  00:17:14,124
So, feel free to review this lecture or
305

305

00:17:14,124  -->  00:17:16,722
to even ask some questions in the course forums
306

306

00:17:16,722  -->  00:17:19,282
if you have some and then after that
307

307

00:17:19,282  -->  00:17:21,699
see you in the next lecture.
