00:00:02,040  -->  00:00:05,569 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Let's continue to build our features section</v>
2

2

00:00:05,569  -->  00:00:07,636 line:15% 
So the first thing that we're gonna do with this
3

3

00:00:07,636  -->  00:00:11,803 line:15% 
is white space, you surely remember that white space
4

4

00:00:12,837  -->  00:00:17,453 line:15% 
is a very important thing, and so let's define white space
5

5

00:00:17,453  -->  00:00:21,620 line:15% 
between the sections for all sections at the same time.
6

6

00:00:22,916  -->  00:00:26,795
So let's format the section, and I will do it here
7

7

00:00:26,795  -->  00:00:30,962
right in the reusable competence part of our code.
8

8

00:00:34,085  -->  00:00:36,663
And we will put that white space
9

9

00:00:36,663  -->  00:00:39,580
between the sections using petting.
10

10

00:00:42,120  -->  00:00:46,287
Now you maybe say that to put a space between elements,
11

11

00:00:48,250  -->  00:00:52,035
we use margin, and that's actually right, but I will use
12

12

00:00:52,035  -->  00:00:55,368
petting because I will later have some--
13

13

00:00:57,259  -->  00:01:00,556
I'm planning to have some sections with background colors,
14

14

00:01:00,556  -->  00:01:04,202
and in order to preserve that background color,
15

15

00:01:04,202  -->  00:01:06,889
we need to make sure that the space
16

16

00:01:06,889  -->  00:01:09,472
is inside of each of the boxes.
17

17

00:01:10,736  -->  00:01:12,736
You will see that later.
18

18

00:01:14,391  -->  00:01:19,382
So I want a lot of white space, so let me say 80 pixels
19

19

00:01:19,382  -->  00:01:21,882
at the top, and on the bottom.
20

20

00:01:23,052  -->  00:01:26,885
Zero, so zero at left and right, so no margin.
21

21

00:01:31,601  -->  00:01:35,218 line:15% 
Great, so this is a lot of white space,
22

22

00:01:35,218  -->  00:01:37,385 line:15% 
and it looks great, right?
23

23

00:01:41,818  -->  00:01:45,985 line:15% 
So the next thing is to format the H2 heading here.
24

24

00:01:50,735  -->  00:01:54,902 line:15% 
So I want the H2 heading to look quite similar to the H1.
25

25

00:01:59,489  -->  00:02:04,133 line:15% 
For example, I want it to have the same text transform,
26

26

00:02:04,133  -->  00:02:08,216 line:15% 
the same letter spacing, and the same font white.
27

27

00:02:11,307  -->  00:02:14,724 line:15% 
So what do I do in order to achieve that?
28

28

00:02:15,835  -->  00:02:19,157 line:15% 
I just group the similar properties
29

29

00:02:19,157  -->  00:02:21,570 line:15% 
just as I showed you before.
30

30

00:02:21,570  -->  00:02:25,320 line:15% 
So H1 and H2 will have some things in common.
31

31

00:02:35,199  -->  00:02:36,032
H1 and H2.
32

32

00:02:40,160  -->  00:02:43,827
So this is for H1 only, this is for H1 only,
33

33

00:02:50,771  -->  00:02:52,188
and this as well.
34

34

00:02:57,982  -->  00:03:02,149
And also this, but the rest, we can leave here for both.
35

35

00:03:06,829  -->  00:03:10,996 line:15% 
Now on H2, I want another font size, not so big, of course.
36

36

00:03:14,933  -->  00:03:19,100 line:15% 
And I will say maybe 180 percent, so it's not so big.
37

37

00:03:22,433  -->  00:03:25,516 line:15% 
And maybe a word spacing of 2 pixels.
38

38

00:03:27,355  -->  00:03:30,698 line:15% 
Alright, I also want to align it on the web page
39

39

00:03:30,698  -->  00:03:34,968 line:15% 
inside of the row, so I will make center--
40

40

00:03:34,968  -->  00:03:38,051 line:15% 
sorry, I will make text align center.
41

41

00:03:41,632  -->  00:03:44,674 line:15% 
Yeah, that looks much better than before.
42

42

00:03:44,674  -->  00:03:47,841 line:15% 
Now let's put some space between this.
43

43

00:03:49,991  -->  00:03:53,574 line:15% 
So again, we use some margin at the bottom.
44

44

00:03:55,250  -->  00:03:58,750 line:15% 
30 pixels should be a good value for this.
45

45

00:04:00,812  -->  00:04:04,312 line:15% 
And now, I want a nice, little yellow line
46

46

00:04:06,650  -->  00:04:10,483 line:15% 
between the H2 and the text, and as I told you
47

47

00:04:12,199  -->  00:04:14,614 line:15% 
in the first lecture, we will learn to put some content
48

48

00:04:14,614  -->  00:04:18,677 line:15% 
on a website just with CSS, so we do that
49

49

00:04:18,677  -->  00:04:21,094 line:15% 
using the after pseudo-class.
50

50

00:04:25,318  -->  00:04:29,485 line:15% 
So after it's just some stuff that will appear after the H2,
51

51

00:04:31,123  -->  00:04:33,373 line:15% 
such as the name indicates.
52

52

00:04:34,861  -->  00:04:36,417 line:15% 
And now we can style this
53

53

00:04:36,417  -->  00:04:39,334 line:15% 
just as if it was a normal element.
54

54

00:04:42,910  -->  00:04:47,077 line:15% 
You can say you want it to display as a block element,
55

55

00:04:48,508  -->  00:04:51,927 line:15% 
and we want a eight of two pixels,
56

56

00:04:51,927  -->  00:04:56,094 line:15% 
so it will be a nice little line with two pixel sides.
57

57

00:04:57,824  -->  00:05:01,907 line:15% 
And we want it to be orange, and you already know
58

58

00:05:02,786  -->  00:05:06,119
where to find that orange, it's up here.
59

59

00:05:09,542  -->  00:05:13,375
Paste it here, and now a very important thing:
60

60

00:05:14,558  -->  00:05:18,725
whenever we do a after pseudo-class, we have to specify
61

61

00:05:21,477  -->  00:05:25,644
its content, and in this case, we don't want any words
62

62

00:05:27,376  -->  00:05:30,543
to appear, so we put a space in there.
63

63

00:05:34,179  -->  00:05:37,244
Now the width of that line, of that box will be
64

64

00:05:37,244  -->  00:05:41,411
another pixel, and alright, let's see how that looks.
65

65

00:05:46,277  -->  00:05:49,202 line:15% 
So somethings is not right here,
66

66

00:05:49,202  -->  00:05:53,963 line:15% 
because we want it centered, and of course the reason
67

67

00:05:53,963  -->  00:05:58,130
for that is that we have to say that we want it centered,
68

68

00:06:00,789  -->  00:06:03,872
and we do that such as we did before.
69

69

00:06:06,664  -->  00:06:09,938
So we say we want a margin zero, and bottom zero,
70

70

00:06:09,938  -->  00:06:14,105
and left and right auto, and now this should work.
71

71

00:06:15,232  -->  00:06:18,831
And also we need to specify some margin
72

72

00:06:18,831  -->  00:06:21,084
between this and the bottom.
73

73

00:06:21,084  -->  00:06:24,917
Three pixels as well, such as we have it here.
74

74

00:06:27,471  -->  00:06:30,859 line:15% 
So let's take a look at this, alright,
75

75

00:06:30,859  -->  00:06:35,026 line:15% 
but we still don't have the margin that we want, and--
76

76

00:06:36,107  -->  00:06:40,274
yeah, the reason's because this has to be margin top.
77

77

00:06:42,701  -->  00:06:46,868
So there's a margin between DH2 after, so this block,
78

78

00:06:48,506  -->  00:06:52,089
and the actual H2, and then 30 pixels after
79

79

00:06:54,915  -->  00:06:57,415
that orange block we inserted,
80

80

00:07:00,163  -->  00:07:03,483 line:15% 
and this is exactly what we want.
81

81

00:07:03,483  -->  00:07:06,130 line:15% 
Now next up, we have this text here.
82

82

00:07:06,130  -->  00:07:10,130 line:15% 
So let's define a nice paragraph style for this.
83

83

00:07:13,746  -->  00:07:17,913 line:15% 
So this can also go here into the reusable competence
84

84

00:07:19,992  -->  00:07:24,159 line:15% 
that will make a little sub-section here for paragraphs.
85

85

00:07:28,584  -->  00:07:32,751 line:15% 
So this is called long copy, and one thing we will do
86

86

00:07:35,537  -->  00:07:39,740 line:15% 
is to change the line height, which is one thing
87

87

00:07:39,740  -->  00:07:43,478 line:15% 
that we learned in the typography lecture.
88

88

00:07:43,478  -->  00:07:47,645 line:15% 
So line height should be between 120 and 145 percent,
89

89

00:07:49,933  -->  00:07:54,508 line:15% 
and I will actually use the highest of the values,
90

90

00:07:54,508  -->  00:07:57,758 line:15% 
because I really like some line height.
91

91

00:08:01,078  -->  00:08:04,074 line:15% 
Now one thing that you notice is that this line
92

92

00:08:04,074  -->  00:08:07,999 line:15% 
is very long, because another rule of typography
93

93

00:08:07,999  -->  00:08:11,499 line:15% 
was that this line should have at most two
94

94

00:08:14,454  -->  00:08:17,821 line:15% 
complete alphabets, and this is way more,
95

95

00:08:17,821  -->  00:08:21,821 line:15% 
so let's make this paragraph a little less wide,
96

96

00:08:23,277  -->  00:08:26,807 line:15% 
so I will say that the width of this paragraph
97

97

00:08:26,807  -->  00:08:28,557 line:15% 
should be 70 percent.
98

98

00:08:30,220  -->  00:08:34,387 line:15% 
Now the problem is that it will no longer be centered,
99

99

00:08:35,421  -->  00:08:39,588 line:15% 
so a good idea for this problem is that instead of trying
100

100

00:08:40,669  -->  00:08:45,389 line:15% 
to centering it, is to do another thing, which is this:
101

101

00:08:45,389  -->  00:08:49,499 line:15% 
we say that the margin left should be 15 percent.
102

102

00:08:49,499  -->  00:08:50,416 line:15% 
And why 15?
103

103

00:08:51,310  -->  00:08:55,374 line:15% 
Because the total width would be 100 percent,
104

104

00:08:55,374  -->  00:08:59,541 line:15% 
so if we want to center it, the remaining 30 percent
105

105

00:09:00,389  -->  00:09:02,316 line:15% 
should be distributed to both sides.
106

106

00:09:02,316  -->  00:09:07,100 line:15% 
So 15 percent left, 15 percent right, plus the 70 percent,
107

107

00:09:07,100  -->  00:09:10,267 line:15% 
which is our width, makes 100 percent.
108

108

00:09:12,069  -->  00:09:15,236 line:15% 
Okay, so let's see what it looks like.
109

109

00:09:17,711  -->  00:09:20,080 line:15% 
Okay, and this is way better now.
110

110

00:09:20,080  -->  00:09:22,495
Maybe you already noticed that sometimes I have to scroll
111

111

00:09:22,495  -->  00:09:25,350
the webpage a little bit in order to make
112

112

00:09:25,350  -->  00:09:28,508
our changes appear here, and I actually have no idea
113

113

00:09:28,508  -->  00:09:32,246
why this happens, it must be something with the connection
114

114

00:09:32,246  -->  00:09:36,117
between bracket and the browser, so don't worry,
115

115

00:09:36,117  -->  00:09:40,536
maybe if you also experience this, just scroll your website
116

116

00:09:40,536  -->  00:09:44,369
a little bit, and then the change will appear.
117

117

00:09:45,226  -->  00:09:49,080 line:15% 
Now the next thing is to format these boxes.
118

118

00:09:49,080  -->  00:09:51,467 line:15% 
And the first thing I notice immediately
119

119

00:09:51,467  -->  00:09:56,250 line:15% 
is that these columns are a little too close to each other,
120

120

00:09:56,250  -->  00:10:00,129 line:15% 
so I should give them some petting here,
121

121

00:10:00,129  -->  00:10:04,122 line:15% 
like for example, one percent petting.
122

122

00:10:04,122  -->  00:10:08,289
So let's go back to CSS, and now how should we do this?
123

123

00:10:12,737  -->  00:10:16,904
So we should never, ever change anything of these classes
124

124

00:10:20,423  -->  00:10:24,423
which come from our grid, so what we can do here
125

125

00:10:25,647  -->  00:10:30,268
is to add another class, and then format that class,
126

126

00:10:30,268  -->  00:10:33,685
and I will call it box, because you know,
127

127

00:10:38,697  -->  00:10:42,197 line:15% 
it's like a box where all the features go.
128

128

00:10:45,593  -->  00:10:49,760
And I will actually reuse this box probably later,
129

129

00:10:50,608  -->  00:10:52,536
so let me just put it here.
130

130

00:10:52,536  -->  00:10:55,703
I will call it box, and I just want to
131

131

00:10:57,714  -->  00:11:00,464
have it a petting of one percent.
132

132

00:11:02,700  -->  00:11:06,700 line:15% 
Alright, and that looks a little bit better now.
133

133

00:11:12,017  -->  00:11:16,184 line:15% 
Now, these H3 elements here, they should be similar
134

134

00:11:18,565  -->  00:11:22,065 line:15% 
to this one, but a little smaller, so I do
135

135

00:11:24,904  -->  00:11:29,071 line:15% 
all the petting elements look similar, so that we maintain
136

136

00:11:31,104  -->  00:11:34,687
a similar style all throughout the webpage.
137

137

00:11:37,211  -->  00:11:41,460
So I want these three attributes to be always the same
138

138

00:11:41,460  -->  00:11:45,460
in all these three pettings, and for the H3 ones
139

139

00:11:47,126  -->  00:11:50,959 line:15% 
in specific, it should also be a little bigger
140

140

00:11:54,556  -->  00:11:58,364 line:15% 
than the normal font size, but only slightly bigger,
141

141

00:11:58,364  -->  00:12:02,531 line:15% 
so maybe 110 percent should be fine, and then also
142

142

00:12:05,701  -->  00:12:10,159 line:15% 
some space between the H3 and the paragraph,
143

143

00:12:10,159  -->  00:12:14,326 line:15% 
so let me say a margin bottom for instance, 15 pixels.
144

144

00:12:21,573  -->  00:12:25,490 line:15% 
Alright, now I really don't like that this text
145

145

00:12:26,715  -->  00:12:30,882 line:15% 
doesn't fit in one line, so what can we do about that?
146

146

00:12:32,010  -->  00:12:34,842
Let's go back and maybe the reason for that
147

147

00:12:34,842  -->  00:12:39,009
is this letter spacing, so if we take that away from the H3,
148

148

00:12:44,525  -->  00:12:48,692
and I do this by pasting it here under H1 and in H2
149

149

00:12:51,003  -->  00:12:54,753
headings, we will see so now the H3 no longer
150

150

00:12:57,792  -->  00:13:01,875
has the letter spacing so let's see what happens.
151

151

00:13:04,456  -->  00:13:07,789 line:15% 
Okay, now it fits, just as we wanted it,
152

152

00:13:10,090  -->  00:13:12,012 line:15% 
so this is much better.
153

153

00:13:12,012  -->  00:13:16,238 line:15% 
Now as for the text in here, I think this
154

154

00:13:16,238  -->  00:13:18,560 line:15% 
is a little too big, actually.
155

155

00:13:18,560  -->  00:13:21,903 line:15% 
It looks a bit overwhelming, don't you think so?
156

156

00:13:21,903  -->  00:13:24,700 line:15% 
So what we can do here is to make the text
157

157

00:13:24,700  -->  00:13:28,700 line:15% 
a little bit smaller, and raise its line height.
158

158

00:13:32,407  -->  00:13:35,990
So we didn't give it any name because maybe
159

159

00:13:38,338  -->  00:13:42,505
we don't need to, but you can see here, that it's a simple
160

160

00:13:43,516  -->  00:13:47,683
paragraph inside of the box, so you already can guess
161

161

00:13:49,391  -->  00:13:51,808
what I'm gonna do now, right?
162

162

00:13:52,665  -->  00:13:56,125
I'm writing box and then I'm selecting
163

163

00:13:56,125  -->  00:13:59,708
all the paragraphs inside a box, very easy.
164

164

00:14:03,972  -->  00:14:07,889 line:15% 
So as I said a smaller font size, I will choose
165

165

00:14:09,127  -->  00:14:12,239 line:15% 
90 percent here, and again I'm going
166

166

00:14:12,239  -->  00:14:15,072 line:15% 
with a line height of 145 percent.
167

167

00:14:18,160  -->  00:14:20,410 line:15% 
That will look much better.
168

168

00:14:24,359  -->  00:14:27,959 line:15% 
So I think that's way more pleasant to look at.
169

169

00:14:27,959  -->  00:14:31,767 line:15% 
And this section already looks great, don't you think so?
170

170

00:14:31,767  -->  00:14:34,252 line:15% 
The only thing that we need to do now
171

171

00:14:34,252  -->  00:14:37,835 line:15% 
is to change these icons, so let's do that.
172

172

00:14:42,279  -->  00:14:46,196
And in order to do that, I will actually define
173

173

00:14:47,046  -->  00:14:51,643
a new class for all those icons, and I will call this
174

174

00:14:51,643  -->  00:14:55,476
icon big, because we will use some other icons
175

175

00:14:57,564  -->  00:15:01,731
down the road, and they will probably not be as big
176

176

00:15:03,137  -->  00:15:07,304
as these, so let's just call these icons big icons.
177

177

00:15:09,407  -->  00:15:11,682
Makes sense right?
178

178

00:15:11,682  -->  00:15:15,849
So, I can just say I want paragraphs, and here I want
179

179

00:15:19,554  -->  00:15:23,687
some icons, so you see I'm really worried
180

180

00:15:23,687  -->  00:15:27,657
with keeping this code organized, and you will see
181

181

00:15:27,657  -->  00:15:30,769
when you have bigger projects,
182

182

00:15:30,769  -->  00:15:33,973
this becomes incredibly important.
183

183

00:15:33,973  -->  00:15:37,619
So in order to make you get used to this,
184

184

00:15:37,619  -->  00:15:39,452
is why I'm doing this.
185

185

00:15:41,148  -->  00:15:45,315
So let's define the icon big class, and as you notice,
186

186

00:15:49,020  -->  00:15:53,873
it's an icon font, so it's really a font, so you can set
187

187

00:15:53,873  -->  00:15:58,146 line:15% 
its font size, for instance, and I will make it really big.
188

188

00:15:58,146  -->  00:16:01,651 line:15% 
I will start with 400 percent, and if it's too big,
189

189

00:16:01,651  -->  00:16:03,818 line:15% 
we can always reduce that.
190

190

00:16:05,483  -->  00:16:09,650 line:15% 
And I also want this icon to display as a block...
191

191

00:16:10,684  -->  00:16:15,235 line:15% 
display block, so that it forces a line break,
192

192

00:16:15,235  -->  00:16:16,902 line:15% 
as you already know.
193

193

00:16:18,068  -->  00:16:22,235 line:15% 
I want it to be orange, so again as if it was a real font,
194

194

00:16:23,826  -->  00:16:27,993 line:15% 
we can set its color, because color really means font color,
195

195

00:16:30,201  -->  00:16:33,368 line:15% 
so I will again copy this orange color
196

196

00:16:34,206  -->  00:16:38,614 line:15% 
that we're already used to and put it right here.
197

197

00:16:38,614  -->  00:16:42,781 line:15% 
It may be a little margin between the icon and the heading,
198

198

00:16:45,375  -->  00:16:49,542 line:15% 
so margin bottom, of course, and let's say 10 pixels.
199

199

00:16:51,923  -->  00:16:56,090 line:15% 
And, okay, I think we can see how this looks like.
200

200

00:16:59,327  -->  00:17:00,327 line:15% 
Okay, great.
201

201

00:17:01,673  -->  00:17:05,690 line:15% 
Well the icons are probably a little too big, right?
202

202

00:17:05,690  -->  00:17:09,857 line:15% 
So I think I'll maybe 350 percent, and let's check it again.
203

203

00:17:16,325  -->  00:17:18,043 line:15% 
Yeah, that's better.
204

204

00:17:18,043  -->  00:17:21,177
So this is really designing in the browser,
205

205

00:17:21,177  -->  00:17:24,731
that's what I meant when I said-- when I told you
206

206

00:17:24,731  -->  00:17:28,213
what designing in a browser was all about.
207

207

00:17:28,213  -->  00:17:33,090
It's trying, tweaking the CSS codes, and see what
208

208

00:17:33,090  -->  00:17:36,155
looks best and what works best in order
209

209

00:17:36,155  -->  00:17:39,322
to make our website as good as we can.
210

210

00:17:42,146  -->  00:17:46,313 line:15% 
So I think this section is ready, it looks great, right?
211

211

00:17:48,531  -->  00:17:51,281 line:15% 
And see you in the next section.
