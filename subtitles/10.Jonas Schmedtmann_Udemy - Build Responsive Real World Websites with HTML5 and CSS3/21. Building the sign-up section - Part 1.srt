00:00:01,025  -->  00:00:02,864
<v Voiceover>Welcome to yet another lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:02,864  -->  00:00:05,230
on our killer website project.
3

3

00:00:05,230  -->  00:00:09,103
Now it's time to build the sign-up section.
4

4

00:00:09,103  -->  00:00:10,416
So in this section
5

5

00:00:10,416  -->  00:00:13,328
we have three pricing plans side by side
6

6

00:00:13,328  -->  00:00:14,915
and each of these plans
7

7

00:00:14,915  -->  00:00:16,257
has three parts:
8

8

00:00:16,257  -->  00:00:18,456
the price, the description and
9

9

00:00:18,456  -->  00:00:20,389
a sign-up button.
10

10

00:00:20,389  -->  00:00:22,748
We want a user to choose the first plan
11

11

00:00:22,748  -->  00:00:26,430
because it's the most profitable for the company.
12

12

00:00:26,430  -->  00:00:27,600
So it appears
13

13

00:00:27,600  -->  00:00:29,015
as the first plan
14

14

00:00:29,015  -->  00:00:32,598
and also at the full call-to-action button.
15

15

00:00:33,894  -->  00:00:35,231
So the new things
16

16

00:00:35,231  -->  00:00:37,039
we'll learn in this lecture
17

17

00:00:37,039  -->  00:00:40,034
are how to design with CSS border radius
18

18

00:00:40,034  -->  00:00:42,553
and how create box shadows.
19

19

00:00:42,553  -->  00:00:45,119
All the other things we'll do in this lecture
20

20

00:00:45,119  -->  00:00:46,191
use concepts
21

21

00:00:46,191  -->  00:00:48,186
that you are already familiar with,
22

22

00:00:48,186  -->  00:00:50,690
which is pretty cool.
23

23

00:00:50,690  -->  00:00:53,843
So here we are, back in our html file
24

24

00:00:53,843  -->  00:00:57,671
which already has more than 250 lines of code.
25

25

00:00:57,671  -->  00:01:00,165
This is quite impressive.
26

26

00:01:00,165  -->  00:01:03,214
So, yet another section here
27

27

00:01:03,214  -->  00:01:04,605
which I'll call,
28

28

00:01:04,605  -->  00:01:05,938
"section plans".
29

29

00:01:09,218  -->  00:01:10,051
Okay.
30

30

00:01:14,225  -->  00:01:15,058
And I will
31

31

00:01:16,536  -->  00:01:18,178
add a url here
32

32

00:01:18,178  -->  00:01:20,222
in which I will add
33

33

00:01:20,222  -->  00:01:21,222
the h2 title
34

34

00:01:22,580  -->  00:01:25,830
such as the many of the other sections.
35

35

00:01:26,772  -->  00:01:30,244
So let me get the text for this section
36

36

00:01:30,244  -->  00:01:31,494
in our document
37

37

00:01:32,421  -->  00:01:33,671
and here it is.
38

38

00:01:38,534  -->  00:01:40,451
And paste it down here.
39

39

00:01:42,544  -->  00:01:46,711
So the title here is "Start eating healthy today".
40

40

00:01:47,844  -->  00:01:49,927
It's actually right here.
41

41

00:01:50,903  -->  00:01:51,736
Alright.
42

42

00:01:53,642  -->  00:01:55,699
So I'm speeding things up a little bit
43

43

00:01:55,699  -->  00:01:59,189
because by now you are already familiar
44

44

00:01:59,189  -->  00:02:01,214
with most of this stuff.
45

45

00:02:01,214  -->  00:02:05,721
So, as you saw in the sketch that I showed you before,
46

46

00:02:05,721  -->  00:02:07,971
we have three columns here.
47

47

00:02:10,297  -->  00:02:12,372
Where each column is a pricing plan.
48

48

00:02:12,372  -->  00:02:14,789
So col and span one of three.
49

49

00:02:19,438  -->  00:02:20,504
Now the question is
50

50

00:02:20,504  -->  00:02:22,979
how are we gonna organise our codes
51

51

00:02:22,979  -->  00:02:25,479
inside of each of these boxes.
52

52

00:02:27,553  -->  00:02:29,239
I will now actually create
53

53

00:02:29,239  -->  00:02:31,989
another div inside of this column
54

54

00:02:32,984  -->  00:02:34,512
and you will later understand why
55

55

00:02:34,512  -->  00:02:36,384
I'm doing this.
56

56

00:02:36,384  -->  00:02:39,226
I'll call this one "plan box".
57

57

00:02:39,226  -->  00:02:42,636
But it has a pretty good reason actually.
58

58

00:02:42,636  -->  00:02:45,025
And as I said I will explain to you later
59

59

00:02:45,025  -->  00:02:47,775
the importance of doing it this way.
60

60

00:02:47,775  -->  00:02:51,860
So I as I said, each of these pricing plans
61

61

00:02:51,860  -->  00:02:53,798
will have three sections.
62

62

00:02:53,798  -->  00:02:56,131
So I create three divs here.
63

63

00:02:57,134  -->  00:02:59,717
The first one is for the price.
64

64

00:03:00,767  -->  00:03:01,600
And another one
65

65

00:03:01,600  -->  00:03:03,529
for the details
66

66

00:03:03,529  -->  00:03:05,379
and yet another one
67

67

00:03:05,379  -->  00:03:07,296
for the sign-up button.
68

68

00:03:08,952  -->  00:03:11,759
So lemme check the text here.
69

69

00:03:11,759  -->  00:03:14,403
So the first one is the premium.
70

70

00:03:14,403  -->  00:03:15,903
So let's copy this
71

71

00:03:16,823  -->  00:03:19,240
and let's reuse our h3 title.
72

72

00:03:21,651  -->  00:03:23,713
So this one is the premium.
73

73

00:03:23,713  -->  00:03:25,744
And now we need to put the price of
74

74

00:03:25,744  -->  00:03:27,161
399 dollars here.
75

75

00:03:28,592  -->  00:03:31,656
So I will make a paragraph with this
76

76

00:03:31,656  -->  00:03:33,997
and call this paragraph
77

77

00:03:33,997  -->  00:03:35,080
"plan price".
78

78

00:03:36,337  -->  00:03:37,670
And in this case
79

79

00:03:39,287  -->  00:03:42,345
we have to attribute a class name to this paragraph
80

80

00:03:42,345  -->  00:03:44,931
because we will have multiple paragraphs
81

81

00:03:44,931  -->  00:03:47,054
and then with a class name,
82

82

00:03:47,054  -->  00:03:49,554
it's the easiest way to select
83

83

00:03:50,661  -->  00:03:52,325
those paragraphs later for
84

84

00:03:52,325  -->  00:03:53,813
the CSS code.
85

85

00:03:53,813  -->  00:03:54,980
So 399 dollars
86

86

00:03:56,421  -->  00:03:57,254
per month
87

87

00:03:59,829  -->  00:04:00,662
and
88

88

00:04:02,478  -->  00:04:06,008
then the other text we have down there
89

89

00:04:06,008  -->  00:04:09,258
and this one will be "plan price month"
90

90

00:04:12,818  -->  00:04:13,985
for this text.
91

91

00:04:15,254  -->  00:04:18,461
So that's the price per month.
92

92

00:04:18,461  -->  00:04:20,786
Actually it's the price per meal so
93

93

00:04:20,786  -->  00:04:23,119
let's change this to "meal".
94

94

00:04:25,204  -->  00:04:26,037
Okay.
95

95

00:04:26,037  -->  00:04:26,870
Nice.
96

96

00:04:28,141  -->  00:04:30,667
Now we have some details here
97

97

00:04:30,667  -->  00:04:32,241
and
98

98

00:04:32,241  -->  00:04:33,447
as before,
99

99

00:04:33,447  -->  00:04:36,052
I will use an unordered list
100

100

00:04:36,052  -->  00:04:38,635
in order to show these details.
101

101

00:04:39,501  -->  00:04:41,623
In our A-list element,
102

102

00:04:41,623  -->  00:04:42,879
I think we should use,
103

103

00:04:42,879  -->  00:04:44,091
an icon here
104

104

00:04:44,091  -->  00:04:45,424
like a checkmark
105

105

00:04:46,273  -->  00:04:50,158
and you already know where to find him.
106

106

00:04:50,158  -->  00:04:52,954
We will again use our icon font here
107

107

00:04:52,954  -->  00:04:54,531
and let's find,
108

108

00:04:54,531  -->  00:04:56,906
here in our iOS-inspired icons,
109

109

00:04:56,906  -->  00:04:58,914
a checkmark and
110

110

00:04:58,914  -->  00:05:01,163
it's easy to find actually.
111

111

00:05:01,163  -->  00:05:03,163
So I will take this code
112

112

00:05:04,210  -->  00:05:05,043
and
113

113

00:05:07,604  -->  00:05:09,271
create an icon here.
114

114

00:05:12,598  -->  00:05:14,515
So a checkmark and then
115

115

00:05:15,466  -->  00:05:17,716
the text that we want here.
116

116

00:05:18,792  -->  00:05:20,625
So one meal every day.
117

117

00:05:23,137  -->  00:05:26,103
And now we'll actually just duplicate this
118

118

00:05:26,103  -->  00:05:27,353
with command D.
119

119

00:05:31,410  -->  00:05:33,410
So order 24/7
120

120

00:05:42,405  -->  00:05:43,905
and free delivery.
121

121

00:05:48,136  -->  00:05:49,136
Okay. Great.
122

122

00:05:50,264  -->  00:05:52,181
So this is the html for
123

123

00:05:53,097  -->  00:05:54,978
the second section
124

124

00:05:54,978  -->  00:05:57,085
of this pricing plan.
125

125

00:05:57,085  -->  00:05:57,985
And now the last one.
126

126

00:05:57,985  -->  00:06:00,853
And this one should be pretty easy because it's just
127

127

00:06:00,853  -->  00:06:02,186
a sign-up button
128

128

00:06:03,164  -->  00:06:06,102
and we already had that before.
129

129

00:06:06,102  -->  00:06:07,519
So href,
130

130

00:06:07,519  -->  00:06:09,358
again points to nowhere.
131

131

00:06:09,358  -->  00:06:11,108
And then our class is
132

132

00:06:11,944  -->  00:06:14,180
the button class we used before
133

133

00:06:14,180  -->  00:06:16,746
and we want a full button
134

134

00:06:16,746  -->  00:06:18,579
for this pricing plan.
135

135

00:06:20,948  -->  00:06:24,007
And the text that should go here is sign-up.
136

136

00:06:24,007  -->  00:06:25,820
Simple as that.
137

137

00:06:25,820  -->  00:06:26,820
Sign up now.
138

138

00:06:28,726  -->  00:06:30,220
Okay. Great.
139

139

00:06:30,220  -->  00:06:31,803
So, I think this is
140

140

00:06:33,639  -->  00:06:35,472
a good html structure.
141

141

00:06:36,981  -->  00:06:38,481
So let's copy this
142

142

00:06:40,250  -->  00:06:42,917
and paste it here two more times
143

143

00:06:45,793  -->  00:06:48,015
for the other two.
144

144

00:06:48,015  -->  00:06:50,932
This is pro and it's 149 per month.
145

145

00:06:52,044  -->  00:06:54,377
So the pro is 149 per month.
146

146

00:06:56,846  -->  00:06:59,429
And that's only 14.90 per meal.
147

147

00:07:08,575  -->  00:07:09,854
Per meal.
148

148

00:07:09,854  -->  00:07:10,687
Alright.
149

149

00:07:18,540  -->  00:07:19,707
Then one meal,
150

150

00:07:21,583  -->  00:07:22,416
ten days
151

151

00:07:29,937  -->  00:07:32,864
or 24/7. It's the same.
152

152

00:07:32,864  -->  00:07:35,281
And the rest is all the same.
153

153

00:07:37,065  -->  00:07:38,732
So now here, Starter
154

154

00:07:41,795  -->  00:07:43,795
and we have 19 per meal.
155

155

00:07:47,757  -->  00:07:50,257
So this is a little different.
156

156

00:07:54,017  -->  00:07:55,767
All good. Write this.
157

157

00:07:59,301  -->  00:08:03,134
And we actually gonna have this paragraph here
158

158

00:08:04,094  -->  00:08:08,094
because it's the price per meal is already 19 so
159

159

00:08:10,559  -->  00:08:12,017
delete this.
160

160

00:08:12,017  -->  00:08:14,385
Or actually not delete it.
161

161

00:08:14,385  -->  00:08:16,552
We'll just leave to empty.
162

162

00:08:19,707  -->  00:08:22,957
And now, right here it's just one meal.
163

163

00:08:24,899  -->  00:08:26,149
Order from h12.
164

164

00:08:31,856  -->  00:08:34,048
Free deliveries here.
165

165

00:08:34,048  -->  00:08:36,298
And this one will be empty.
166

166

00:08:39,054  -->  00:08:40,493
And since it's empty
167

167

00:08:40,493  -->  00:08:42,481
it shouldn't have a checkmark
168

168

00:08:42,481  -->  00:08:45,314
but we can put like a cross there,
169

169

00:08:46,800  -->  00:08:48,050
like this here.
170

170

00:08:52,954  -->  00:08:54,621
This will be better.
171

171

00:08:55,911  -->  00:08:58,244
Alright, so this is our text
172

172

00:08:59,799  -->  00:09:02,203
and I've one more thing to change here
173

173

00:09:02,203  -->  00:09:03,536
because we had a
174

174

00:09:05,630  -->  00:09:09,213
full button for the first pricing plan
175

175

00:09:09,213  -->  00:09:11,630
but here want a ghost button.
176

176

00:09:13,821  -->  00:09:15,744
I hope you remembered those.
177

177

00:09:15,744  -->  00:09:18,440
We had them in the first section.
178

178

00:09:18,440  -->  00:09:20,440
So let's check this out.
179

179

00:09:23,195  -->  00:09:24,445
And here it is.
180

180

00:09:26,162  -->  00:09:26,995
Okay.
181

181

00:09:28,252  -->  00:09:29,620
So as you would expect
182

182

00:09:29,620  -->  00:09:31,689
this is not yet formatted.
183

183

00:09:31,689  -->  00:09:33,434
The only formatted things are the buttons
184

184

00:09:33,434  -->  00:09:35,775
because we already did that before.
185

185

00:09:35,775  -->  00:09:37,790
Such as the h3 elements
186

186

00:09:37,790  -->  00:09:39,790
and the title as always.
187

187

00:09:41,269  -->  00:09:42,366
So in the next lecture,
188

188

00:09:42,366  -->  00:09:44,316
it's then time to format
189

189

00:09:44,316  -->  00:09:46,088
the whole thing.
190

190

00:09:46,088  -->  00:09:48,255
I,m waiting for you there.
