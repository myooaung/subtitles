<v Voiceover>Welcome to part two</v>
2

2

00:00:02.864  -->  00:00:05.105
of Building a sticky navigation.
3

3

00:00:05.105  -->  00:00:08.309
In this video we'll use jQuery to make this
4

4

00:00:08.309  -->  00:00:11.559
sticky navigation work the way want it.
5

5

00:00:12.628  -->  00:00:17.202
So, in order to do that, we use a simple jQuery plugin
6

6

00:00:17.202  -->  00:00:18.886
which is called Waypoints.
7

7

00:00:18.886  -->  00:00:22.589
And Waypoints is an easy way to trigger a function
8

8

00:00:22.589  -->  00:00:26.756
when we scroll to an element, which is exactly what we want.
9

9

00:00:28.023  -->  00:00:31.308
So I will start downloading it
10

10

00:00:31.308  -->  00:00:33.975
and including it in our project.
11

11

00:00:38.030  -->  00:00:39.197
So here it is.
12

12

00:00:41.548  -->  00:00:42.715
And extract it
13

13

00:00:47.110  -->  00:00:51.277
and well, this comes with a bunch of stuff actually
14

14

00:00:52.346  -->  00:00:55.034
but the file that we want is this one here
15

15

00:00:55.034  -->  00:00:58.284
jQuery waypoints and the small version.
16

16

00:00:59.834  -->  00:01:01.084
So I'll copy it
17

17

00:01:05.001  -->  00:01:06.001
and omnifood
18

18

00:01:07.949  -->  00:01:11.792
and Vendors because this time it is a JavaScript file
19

19

00:01:11.792  -->  00:01:16.773
that we got from the internet, it's not our own file.
20

20

00:01:16.773  -->  00:01:19.081
And actually I think it's time to
21

21

00:01:19.081  -->  00:01:21.614
delete this old stuff here.
22

22

00:01:21.614  -->  00:01:23.364
We don't need anymore
23

23

00:01:24.882  -->  00:01:27.065
and this as well.
24

24

00:01:27.065  -->  00:01:31.929
Okay so we have a nice, clean folder structure here.
25

25

00:01:31.929  -->  00:01:35.993
And I'm now going to include this in our project
26

26

00:01:35.993  -->  00:01:38.594
so that we don't forget it.
27

27

00:01:38.594  -->  00:01:42.094
So we come down here and I'll put it here.
28

28

00:01:46.396  -->  00:01:50.063
So as before, script and now it's Vendors js
29

29

00:01:51.145  -->  00:01:52.591
and here we go.
30

30

00:01:52.591  -->  00:01:56.446
So our own script is always the last one here.
31

31

00:01:56.446  -->  00:02:00.613
We need to ensure that this is the last script we call.
32

32

00:02:02.402  -->  00:02:05.316
So, let's go to the Waypoints website
33

33

00:02:05.316  -->  00:02:08.149
and take a look at how this works.
34

34

00:02:09.716  -->  00:02:13.883
So here in jQuery, and this is here the way that we
35

35

00:02:14.896  -->  00:02:16.069
want to use this.
36

36

00:02:16.069  -->  00:02:18.391
And here is actually kind of a demo, so we scroll
37

37

00:02:18.391  -->  00:02:22.558
and then some stuff happens on the website, right.
38

38

00:02:23.696  -->  00:02:26.715
So I will now go ahead and copy this snippet here
39

39

00:02:26.715  -->  00:02:30.882
so that we can see how Waypoints should be used with jQuery.
40

40

00:02:34.413  -->  00:02:37.652
I'll put it here in a comment
41

41

00:02:37.652  -->  00:02:41.112
and you see the comment in jQuery
42

42

00:02:41.112  -->  00:02:44.779
are done the exact same way as we do in CSS.
43

43

00:02:47.253  -->  00:02:49.920
So, how do we want this to work?
44

44

00:02:51.154  -->  00:02:53.453
Let's go back to our webpage
45

45

00:02:53.453  -->  00:02:57.191
and the thing is we want this to appear
46

46

00:02:57.191  -->  00:03:02.091
so we want this sticky navigation to appear each time
47

47

00:03:02.091  -->  00:03:05.258
we scroll to this element here, right.
48

48

00:03:07.408  -->  00:03:09.637
So we want it to be hidden here
49

49

00:03:09.637  -->  00:03:14.548
and we want it to appear once we come to this section.
50

50

00:03:14.548  -->  00:03:17.230
All right, so the first step is to actually select
51

51

00:03:17.230  -->  00:03:19.147
this section in jQuery.
52

52

00:03:20.887  -->  00:03:25.717
So we already know how to do that with this selector,
53

53

00:03:25.717  -->  00:03:29.384
and now we need a class name such as in CSS.
54

54

00:03:30.814  -->  00:03:32.481
And now, the section
55

55

00:03:35.667  -->  00:03:39.092
is this one, and we could go ahead
56

56

00:03:39.092  -->  00:03:41.809
and just use this class name
57

57

00:03:41.809  -->  00:03:44.816
but we want a cleaner separation here
58

58

00:03:44.816  -->  00:03:47.733
between the CSS and the JavaScript,
59

59

00:03:48.600  -->  00:03:50.017
and the jQuery in this case.
60

60

00:03:50.017  -->  00:03:53.395
So we don't want to mix up these two things
61

61

00:03:53.395  -->  00:03:57.562
so we will create a separate class for JavaScript.
62

62

00:03:58.422  -->  00:04:01.998
So this is much cleaner, and if you have bigger projects
63

63

00:04:01.998  -->  00:04:05.516
it will become easier to manage this way.
64

64

00:04:05.516  -->  00:04:07.516
So section and features.
65

65

00:04:09.463  -->  00:04:13.046
And here we have two dashes, so to separate
66

66

00:04:14.816  -->  00:04:17.335
this name from this name in a better way.
67

67

00:04:17.335  -->  00:04:20.085
So I will select this in a script
68

68

00:04:21.061  -->  00:04:24.811
and actually just close these two, all right.
69

69

00:04:26.030  -->  00:04:30.988
And now this is where our Waypoint's plugin comes in.
70

70

00:04:30.988  -->  00:04:33.905
So now we the Waypoints method here
71

71

00:04:36.668  -->  00:04:40.325
and this is how it works, such as it's down here.
72

72

00:04:40.325  -->  00:04:43.274
So function and then this function
73

73

00:04:43.274  -->  00:04:46.024
has an argument called direction.
74

74

00:04:48.092  -->  00:04:52.028
And what this direction means is that we can actually detect
75

75

00:04:52.028  -->  00:04:54.594
if the user is scrolling down the webpage
76

76

00:04:54.594  -->  00:04:56.616
or if he's scrolling up.
77

77

00:04:56.616  -->  00:04:58.381
And we will take now a decision
78

78

00:04:58.381  -->  00:05:00.798
based on this parameter here.
79

79

00:05:03.280  -->  00:05:06.514
So, if you're new to programming,
80

80

00:05:06.514  -->  00:05:09.741
we have a thing in programming in all major
81

81

00:05:09.741  -->  00:05:14.009
programming languages which is called the If Construct
82

82

00:05:14.009  -->  00:05:17.423
and what the If does is very simple.
83

83

00:05:17.423  -->  00:05:21.590
So if something is true, then a certain thing will happen,
84

84

00:05:22.765  -->  00:05:26.480
and if it's not true, well then another thing happens.
85

85

00:05:26.480  -->  00:05:28.640
Now in this case we want to say
86

86

00:05:28.640  -->  00:05:30.723
if the direction is down,
87

87

00:05:33.841  -->  00:05:36.674
then something happens and if not,
88

88

00:05:38.241  -->  00:05:41.225
well then something else happens.
89

89

00:05:41.225  -->  00:05:43.725
And what do we want to happen?
90

90

00:05:44.685  -->  00:05:47.852
So if the user scrolls down like this,
91

91

00:05:49.700  -->  00:05:52.788
we want the sticky navigation to appear.
92

92

00:05:52.788  -->  00:05:56.504
And if the user scrolls up like this,
93

93

00:05:56.504  -->  00:05:59.087
then we want this to disappear.
94

94

00:06:02.680  -->  00:06:05.013
So we select the nav element
95

95

00:06:08.402  -->  00:06:11.804
and then in jQuery we have this very handy method
96

96

00:06:11.804  -->  00:06:15.821
and this is actually a jQuery method and had nav
97

97

00:06:15.821  -->  00:06:17.805
and has nothing to do with Waypoints
98

98

00:06:17.805  -->  00:06:19.472
and it is add class.
99

99

00:06:22.426  -->  00:06:27.338
And of course, the class we want to add is sticky.
100

100

00:06:27.338  -->  00:06:30.217
So I will now remove this from here.
101

101

00:06:30.217  -->  00:06:32.134
We no longer need this.
102

102

00:06:33.257  -->  00:06:35.757
So this is the original state.
103

103

00:06:37.692  -->  00:06:39.608
So, when a user scrolls down,
104

104

00:06:39.608  -->  00:06:42.487
then this class sticky will be added.
105

105

00:06:42.487  -->  00:06:46.654
And the other way around, so if the user scrolls up,
106

106

00:06:49.406  -->  00:06:52.989
then remove the class, remove class sticky.
107

107

00:07:01.330  -->  00:07:03.997
So I think this should work now.
108

108

00:07:05.242  -->  00:07:07.825
Here is Waypoint, not Waypoints
109

109

00:07:10.861  -->  00:07:14.414
and now let's go and check this out.
110

110

00:07:14.414  -->  00:07:16.794
So this is the normal state, again so this is how
111

111

00:07:16.794  -->  00:07:20.961
it should look in a normal way, and now this works.
112

112

00:07:25.560  -->  00:07:28.204
So we scrolled past this place here
113

113

00:07:28.204  -->  00:07:31.605
which is the beginning of the section,
114

114

00:07:31.605  -->  00:07:34.614
and then this appears like magic.
115

115

00:07:34.614  -->  00:07:36.614
This is very cool right.
116

116

00:07:37.633  -->  00:07:41.783
But we want it even better because you know,
117

117

00:07:41.783  -->  00:07:44.941
when we come here, now there is no space
118

118

00:07:44.941  -->  00:07:47.530
between this navigation and this title here.
119

119

00:07:47.530  -->  00:07:50.629
So you want this to happen a little sooner.
120

120

00:07:50.629  -->  00:07:55.169
So let's say we want this to happen when we're here
121

121

00:07:55.169  -->  00:07:57.724
and not only down here.
122

122

00:07:57.724  -->  00:08:01.807
So we can easily do that here with this extension
123

123

00:08:02.867  -->  00:08:05.305
and is actually explained down here.
124

124

00:08:05.305  -->  00:08:08.638
So I'll just copy this and paste it here
125

125

00:08:11.481  -->  00:08:14.314
so we can specify some offset here
126

126

00:08:15.428  -->  00:08:19.552
in percent, but I will do it as in pixels,
127

127

00:08:19.552  -->  00:08:23.697
so let's say 60 pixel, so this will happen 60 pixels
128

128

00:08:23.697  -->  00:08:27.280
before we hit this section that we defined.
129

129

00:08:31.986  -->  00:08:34.319
So let's check that as well,
130

130

00:08:36.178  -->  00:08:39.595
and yeah, so this happens at a cool place
131

131

00:08:41.402  -->  00:08:45.569
and now from here on this navigation always stays in place.
132

132

00:08:48.682  -->  00:08:51.805
Now, you saw something strange happen here
133

133

00:08:51.805  -->  00:08:53.388
which was this one.
134

134

00:08:54.625  -->  00:08:58.792
So the navigation kind of is behind of the images, right.
135

135

00:09:00.280  -->  00:09:04.843
So I will have to show you yet one more CSS property
136

136

00:09:04.843  -->  00:09:09.359
and that is actually also kind of an important one
137

137

00:09:09.359  -->  00:09:11.609
and it's this, where is it?
138

138

00:09:14.920  -->  00:09:18.003
We have to say z index, and we set it
139

139

00:09:19.020  -->  00:09:23.187
to the maximum allowed which is 9999, and the z index
140

140

00:09:24.674  -->  00:09:28.257
it finds the vertical stacking of elements.
141

141

00:09:29.201  -->  00:09:32.139
So it's like a stack of elements and now
142

142

00:09:32.139  -->  00:09:35.320
our sticky navigation will be always at the top.
143

143

00:09:35.320  -->  00:09:39.198
So this element will be on top of all the other elements
144

144

00:09:39.198  -->  00:09:43.115
because it has the highest possible value here.
145

145

00:09:45.061  -->  00:09:47.061
So let's check that out.
146

146

00:09:49.911  -->  00:09:54.078
So you see right now this is over all the other elements.
147

147

00:09:56.029  -->  00:09:57.862
So it's always on top.
148

148

00:09:59.466  -->  00:10:01.033
Great, this is exactly what we want.
149

149

00:10:01.033  -->  00:10:03.146
Now something weird happened here, I don't know
150

150

00:10:03.146  -->  00:10:04.690
exactly why this happened.
151

151

00:10:04.690  -->  00:10:08.452
We lost some space here that we had before,
152

152

00:10:08.452  -->  00:10:09.952
let me check that.
153

153

00:10:11.493  -->  00:10:15.326
And yeah, of course, so I have a mistake here.
154

154

00:10:16.927  -->  00:10:19.515
So this is the way to go.

155

00:10:19.515  -->  00:10:21.682
So now it will be perfect.
156

156

00:10:22.987  -->  00:10:27.353
So original state, and once again with sticky navigation.
157

157

00:10:27.353  -->  00:10:29.872
So, very powerful stuff, and we will actually
158

158

00:10:29.872  -->  00:10:33.727
use this Waypoint plugin later again because it allows us
159

159

00:10:33.727  -->  00:10:36.246
to make some cool stuff with it.
160

160

00:10:36.246  -->  00:10:39.113
So I hope you liked this lecture and next stop
161

161

00:10:39.113  -->  00:10:41.807
we will learn how to actually scroll to the different
162

162

00:10:41.807  -->  00:10:45.116
sections when we click on these links here.
163

163

00:10:45.116  -->  00:10:46.283
So stay tuned.
