00:00:01.600  -->  00:00:04.827
<v Voiceover>Welcome to the CSS basic section.</v>
2

2

00:00:04.827  -->  00:00:06.862
So far, we have used HTML
3

3

00:00:06.862  -->  00:00:09.213
to put content on our webpage.
4

4

00:00:09.213  -->  00:00:12.189
Now, we'll use some basic CSS to actually
5

5

00:00:12.189  -->  00:00:14.534
style that content to make it look
6

6

00:00:14.534  -->  00:00:16.928
the way we want it.
7

7

00:00:16.928  -->  00:00:19.541
After this section, you will be able to build
8

8

00:00:19.541  -->  00:00:22.777
a simple layout with some formatted content.
9

9

00:00:22.777  -->  00:00:26.852
We will continue to work on this simple blog past webpage
10

10

00:00:26.852  -->  00:00:29.513
that I showed you before.
11

11

00:00:29.513  -->  00:00:31.491
So we will add some more content,
12

12

00:00:31.491  -->  00:00:34.851
build a simple layout and style the whole thing.
13

13

00:00:34.851  -->  00:00:37.858
After this section, we will be ready to start
14

14

00:00:37.858  -->  00:00:40.358
on our killer website project.
15

15

00:00:41.738  -->  00:00:43.071
So, what is CSS?
16

16

00:00:44.396  -->  00:00:47.563
CSS stands for cascading style sheets.
17

17

00:00:48.853  -->  00:00:53.020
CSS defines exactly how HTML elements should look.
18

18

00:00:53.971  -->  00:00:56.854
It allows us to make a clear separation
19

19

00:00:56.854  -->  00:00:59.611 line:15% 
between content and style.
20

20

00:00:59.611  -->  00:01:02.778 line:15% 
HTML is the content and CSS is style.
21

21

00:01:06.233  -->  00:01:09.633
These two images show the exact same HTML
22

22

00:01:09.633  -->  00:01:10.988
with the only difference
23

23

00:01:10.988  -->  00:01:13.046
that the website on the left side
24

24

00:01:13.046  -->  00:01:15.869
has not been formatted with CSS yet.
25

25

00:01:15.869  -->  00:01:19.306
It's just bare HTML, which doesn't look very good,
26

26

00:01:19.306  -->  00:01:20.139
of course.
27

27

00:01:22.254  -->  00:01:25.164
So how are we gonna use CSS in practice?
28

28

00:01:25.164  -->  00:01:28.224
There are three ways to use CSS.
29

29

00:01:28.224  -->  00:01:31.034
First, we can write CSS code
30

30

00:01:31.034  -->  00:01:35.107
right inside an HTML tag using the style attribute.
31

31

00:01:35.107  -->  00:01:39.205
Second, we can write CSS code in the head section
32

32

00:01:39.205  -->  00:01:40.872
of an HTML document.
33

33

00:01:41.713  -->  00:01:45.880
And third, CSS code can be put into an external file.
34

34

00:01:46.811  -->  00:01:49.654
And this is what we're actually going to do.
35

35

00:01:49.654  -->  00:01:51.311
Remember what I said about
36

36

00:01:51.311  -->  00:01:55.270
how CSS allows us to separate content from style?
37

37

00:01:55.270  -->  00:01:58.136
That is why we'll put all our visual styles
38

38

00:01:58.136  -->  00:02:01.514
in a separate file 'cause it's a much cleaner solution
39

39

00:02:01.514  -->  00:02:05.026
and therefore everybody does it that way.
40

40

00:02:05.026  -->  00:02:09.207
So let's go back to brackets and do this.
41

41

00:02:09.207  -->  00:02:11.423
So let's start by creating a new file
42

42

00:02:11.423  -->  00:02:14.848
just as we did before with the HTML file.
43

43

00:02:14.848  -->  00:02:15.848
So File, New
44

44

00:02:17.565  -->  00:02:21.579
and then save it with command S or control S
45

45

00:02:21.579  -->  00:02:23.996
and I will call it style.css.
46

46

00:02:25.879  -->  00:02:27.480
Okay, that's it.
47

47

00:02:27.480  -->  00:02:30.280
You see, now it appears here
48

48

00:02:30.280  -->  00:02:32.683
in our project folder.
49

49

00:02:32.683  -->  00:02:36.129
Now I'm going to go back to the HTML file
50

50

00:02:36.129  -->  00:02:38.707
because now we have to tell the HTML file
51

51

00:02:38.707  -->  00:02:42.306
in which CSS file the new styles will be.
52

52

00:02:42.306  -->  00:02:44.686
So to link these two documents
53

53

00:02:44.686  -->  00:02:47.686
we use the link tag in the HTML head
54

54

00:02:50.819  -->  00:02:52.069
just like this.
55

55

00:02:53.878  -->  00:02:54.711
Link.
56

56

00:02:57.419  -->  00:03:00.716
And this is another element which has no closing text.
57

57

00:03:00.716  -->  00:03:02.620
So it's just link.
58

58

00:03:02.620  -->  00:03:04.640
I hope you remember HTML attributes
59

59

00:03:04.640  -->  00:03:08.186
because we will use them right now.
60

60

00:03:08.186  -->  00:03:10.009
So at start we tell the browser
61

61

00:03:10.009  -->  00:03:13.724
that we want to link a style sheet.
62

62

00:03:13.724  -->  00:03:15.641
So rel and style sheet.
63

63

00:03:18.228  -->  00:03:19.228
Then next we
64

64

00:03:21.416  -->  00:03:23.249
tell the HTML document
65

65

00:03:24.826  -->  00:03:27.271
that it is a CSS file
66

66

00:03:27.271  -->  00:03:29.524
and finally with the H ref attribute
67

67

00:03:29.524  -->  00:03:31.941
we used before for our links,
68

68

00:03:32.902  -->  00:03:34.569
we tell the document
69

69

00:03:36.336  -->  00:03:38.319
where the CSS styles are.
70

70

00:03:38.319  -->  00:03:42.877
Style.css, which is the file we just created before.
71

71

00:03:42.877  -->  00:03:44.921
So hit enter and now
72

72

00:03:44.921  -->  00:03:47.504
these two documents are linked.
73

73

00:03:49.759  -->  00:03:53.926
Alright, now we are ready to start writing some CSS.
74

74

00:03:55.299  -->  00:03:58.466 line:15% 
And let's do that in the next lecture.
