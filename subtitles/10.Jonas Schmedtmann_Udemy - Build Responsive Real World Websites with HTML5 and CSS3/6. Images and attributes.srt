<v Voiceover>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,854  -->  00:00:04,470
In this video, I'm going to show you
3

3

00:00:04,470  -->  00:00:07,072
how to include images in your webpage
4

4

00:00:07,072  -->  00:00:09,905
and also what HTML attributes are.
5

5

00:00:13,212  -->  00:00:15,101
So back to our webpage,
6

6

00:00:15,101  -->  00:00:17,813
where we want to include some images.
7

7

00:00:17,813  -->  00:00:22,620
But before we can do that, we need some images, right?
8

8

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:26,141
Okay so I will just head here to Google Chrome
9

9

00:00:26,141  -->  00:00:28,537
and type html5,
10

10

00:00:28,537  -->  00:00:33,414
'cause that's the language we're using.
11

11

00:00:33,414  -->  00:00:35,747
And I like this one,
12

12

00:00:36,614  -->  00:00:39,114
so I will save the image
13

13

00:00:40,033  -->  00:00:43,600
right into our project folder
14

14

00:00:43,600  -->  00:00:45,600
and call it logo.
15

15

00:00:46,604  -->  00:00:48,729
So that's one of the images,
16

16

00:00:48,729  -->  00:00:53,043
and beside that, I also want an image for the author.
17

17

00:00:53,043  -->  00:00:57,298
Now you can, of course, use a photo of yourself,
18

18

00:00:57,298  -->  00:01:01,583
but I will use this very handy website
19

19

00:01:01,583  -->  00:01:04,833
called RandomUser,
20

20

00:01:06,160  -->  00:01:10,451
where you can get random profile pictures.
21

21

00:01:10,451  -->  00:01:12,653
So I will just save this one.
22

22

00:01:12,653  -->  00:01:15,403
I will call it author.
23

23

00:01:18,297  -->  00:01:20,297
Okay.
24

24

00:01:21,763  -->  00:01:24,600
Also, down here,
25

25

00:01:24,600  -->  00:01:28,267
I will just write the name of this gentleman
26

26

00:01:29,346  -->  00:01:31,763
so I don't forget it.
27

27

00:01:33,155  -->  00:01:35,646
Gonzales.
28

28

00:01:35,646  -->  00:01:38,896
Okay so this is the author of our page.
29

29

00:01:40,331  -->  00:01:43,228
Now, to put images on our webpage,
30

30

00:01:43,228  -->  00:01:47,463
we use the img tag, which actually has no closing tag,
31

31

00:01:47,463  -->  00:01:49,809
so it's just img.
32

32

00:01:49,809  -->  00:01:52,416
Yeah, that's right, there are some HTML elements
33

33

00:01:52,416  -->  00:01:56,470
which have only the opening tag and no closing tag,
34

34

00:01:56,470  -->  00:01:59,387
and the img element is one of them.
35

35

00:02:02,742  -->  00:02:05,862
Just going to close this, alright.
36

36

00:02:05,862  -->  00:02:08,362
Now I wanna put the image
37

37

00:02:09,702  -->  00:02:12,740
here between this first paragraph
38

38

00:02:12,740  -->  00:02:15,323
and the secondary header.
39

39

00:02:18,193  -->  00:02:20,360
So &lt;img
40

40

00:02:21,604  -->  00:02:24,509
and then close it.
41

41

00:02:24,509  -->  00:02:26,938
And now we're gonna see element attributes
42

42

00:02:26,938  -->  00:02:29,002
for the first time.
43

43

00:02:29,002  -->  00:02:33,670
Attributes provide additional information about an element.
44

44

00:02:33,670  -->  00:02:37,078
Because now, to indicate which image we want to display,
45

45

00:02:37,078  -->  00:02:40,578
we use the source attribute, which is src.
46

46

00:02:43,155  -->  00:02:45,072
Src.
47

47

00:02:46,955  -->  00:02:49,108
And now, Brackets helps us again
48

48

00:02:49,108  -->  00:02:53,275
and shows all the available files in our project folder.
49

49

00:02:54,145  -->  00:02:58,787
And here, in this place, I want to see the logo image.
50

50

00:02:58,787  -->  00:03:01,931
So I just choose this and hit enter.
51

51

00:03:01,931  -->  00:03:03,598
And, here we go.
52

52

00:03:04,948  -->  00:03:07,867
Now the same thing with the author.
53

53

00:03:07,867  -->  00:03:11,174
Go down here and insert the other image.
54

54

00:03:11,174  -->  00:03:14,887
Okay, &lt;img src
55

55

00:03:14,887  -->  00:03:17,763
and Brackets predicts what we wanna write,
56

56

00:03:17,763  -->  00:03:21,930
so hit return and choose the author.
57

57

00:03:24,296  -->  00:03:27,713
Then close it and now it should be there.
58

58

00:03:29,744  -->  00:03:31,024
Here it is.
59

59

00:03:31,024  -->  00:03:33,057
Now, besides the source attribute,
60

60

00:03:33,057  -->  00:03:37,038
we should also give the img elements an alt attribute,
61

61

00:03:37,038  -->  00:03:39,895
which is an alternative text for the image,
62

62

00:03:39,895  -->  00:03:41,479
if the image cannot be displayed
63

63

00:03:41,479  -->  00:03:44,511
in the browser for some reason.
64

64

00:03:44,511  -->  00:03:48,021
I will just put here some text,
65

65

00:03:48,021  -->  00:03:49,581
and the alt text should be some text
66

66

00:03:49,581  -->  00:03:52,437
which describes the image.
67

67

00:03:52,437  -->  00:03:55,591
In this case, I will type in
68

68

00:03:55,591  -->  00:03:59,508
The HTML5 Logo,
69

69

00:04:01,010  -->  00:04:05,086
and down here, I will say this is the
70

70

00:04:05,086  -->  00:04:06,858
Author photo.
71

71

00:04:06,858  -->  00:04:07,691
Now, as you can see,
72

72

00:04:07,691  -->  00:04:11,154
this text doesn't display on the website.
73

73

00:04:11,154  -->  00:04:13,897
It's really just in case the image
74

74

00:04:13,897  -->  00:04:16,859
cannot be displayed for some reason.
75

75

00:04:16,859  -->  00:04:19,482
So, this was images.
76

76

00:04:19,482  -->  00:04:21,923
I think that now you know
77

77

00:04:21,923  -->  00:04:23,695
how you can display images on your website.
78

78

00:04:23,695  -->  00:04:27,600
It's really easy and straightforward.
79

79

00:04:27,600  -->  00:04:30,527
Next up, we have a lecture about links.
80

80

00:04:30,527  -->  00:04:31,694
See you there!
