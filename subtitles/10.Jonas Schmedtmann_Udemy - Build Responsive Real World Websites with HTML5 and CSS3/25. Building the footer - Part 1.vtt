00:00:01.051  -->  00:00:02.272
<v Voiceover>Welcome to our last section</v>
2

2

00:00:02.272  -->  00:00:06.231
we need to build for our website, the footer.
3

3

00:00:06.231  -->  00:00:08.089
Every website has a footer
4

4

00:00:08.089  -->  00:00:11.211
and it's like the conclusion of your website,
5

5

00:00:11.211  -->  00:00:13.453
where the user can find additional information
6

6

00:00:13.453  -->  00:00:15.870
about a website or a company.
7

7

00:00:17.647  -->  00:00:20.340
So this is most simple footer ever,
8

8

00:00:20.340  -->  00:00:24.056
but simple is in many cases a good solution,
9

9

00:00:24.056  -->  00:00:26.899
and this the footer has two navigations.
10

10

00:00:26.899  -->  00:00:29.356
One for less important links, like About Us
11

11

00:00:29.356  -->  00:00:32.618
or a link to a blog, and one for social media
12

12

00:00:32.618  -->  00:00:34.118
on the right side.
13

13

00:00:35.021  -->  00:00:36.925
In a more complex website,
14

14

00:00:36.925  -->  00:00:39.840
the footer usually repeats the main navigation,
15

15

00:00:39.840  -->  00:00:42.463
but that's not necessary in our case.
16

16

00:00:42.463  -->  00:00:44.880
We don't need more than this.
17

17

00:00:46.458  -->  00:00:48.222
So in this last section,
18

18

00:00:48.222  -->  00:00:50.402
there are not many new things to learn,
19

19

00:00:50.402  -->  00:00:52.553
but we keep practicing.
20

20

00:00:52.553  -->  00:00:55.873
So we'll learn how to build a simple but effective footer,
21

21

00:00:55.873  -->  00:01:00.040
and a cool way of using social icons on a webpage.
22

22

00:01:01.028  -->  00:01:03.586
So, for the footer, HTML actually
23

23

00:01:03.586  -->  00:01:07.604
has another special element just for that,
24

24

00:01:07.604  -->  00:01:12.402
and as you can imagine it's called Exactly Footer.
25

25

00:01:12.402  -->  00:01:16.152
So, first, as always, we need a new row here,
26

26

00:01:18.528  -->  00:01:21.861
so a row, and now, as I told you before,
27

27

00:01:22.869  -->  00:01:27.061
we will have two navigations inside of this row.
28

28

00:01:27.061  -->  00:01:29.569
And so we have a column for each of those,
29

29

00:01:29.569  -->  00:01:32.761
because we want them side by side.
30

30

00:01:32.761  -->  00:01:35.594
So I will create two columns here.
31

31

00:01:38.810  -->  00:01:41.310
So column and span one of two.
32

32

00:01:45.434  -->  00:01:49.300
And this is for one of the navigations
33

33

00:01:49.300  -->  00:01:52.217
and then for the second navigation,
34

34

00:01:53.244  -->  00:01:55.545
the social media navigation.
35

35

00:01:55.545  -->  00:01:59.481
So as before, we're gonna use an ordered list
36

36

00:01:59.481  -->  00:02:03.114
in order to build that navigation.
37

37

00:02:03.114  -->  00:02:06.364
And I'm gonna call this one footer nav.
38

38

00:02:09.220  -->  00:02:11.973
And so let's see what we need to include
39

39

00:02:11.973  -->  00:02:13.723
into this navigation.
40

40

00:02:15.095  -->  00:02:18.345
Because we actually have it right here.
41

41

00:02:28.203  -->  00:02:31.370
So the first link will be to About Us.
42

42

00:02:32.301  -->  00:02:35.801
And again, it points nowhere, so About Us.
43

43

00:02:38.083  -->  00:02:40.333
And now just duplicate this
44

44

00:02:43.090  -->  00:02:43.923
and blog
45

45

00:02:48.600  -->  00:02:49.767
press IOS app,
46

46

00:02:57.128  -->  00:02:59.833
and I need to duplicate it once again,
47

47

00:02:59.833  -->  00:03:01.083
so Android app.
48

48

00:03:04.537  -->  00:03:08.344
All right, and now we need another navigation
49

49

00:03:08.344  -->  00:03:11.247
to include links to Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus,
50

50

00:03:11.247  -->  00:03:15.414
and Instagram, because those are the accounts Omnifood uses.
51

51

00:03:17.684  -->  00:03:20.017
So again, an unordered list,
52

52

00:03:20.969  -->  00:03:24.386
and this one will be called social links.
53

53

00:03:30.803  -->  00:03:31.636
So.
54

54

00:03:34.774  -->  00:03:37.096
Now what we need here, we will obviously
55

55

00:03:37.096  -->  00:03:40.021
not write Facebook or Twitter.
56

56

00:03:40.021  -->  00:03:42.820
What we want here is an icon for that.
57

57

00:03:42.820  -->  00:03:46.987
So you already know where we get those, and it's right here.
58

58

00:03:48.219  -->  00:03:52.386
As I showed you, we have some social icons down here.
59

59

00:03:53.559  -->  00:03:56.309
So here's the first for Facebook.
60

60

00:03:59.993  -->  00:04:00.826
So i class
61

61

00:04:08.230  -->  00:04:10.063
and it's easy as this.
62

62

00:04:11.933  -->  00:04:14.683
So I'm duplicating it three times
63

63

00:04:16.357  -->  00:04:18.357
and now one for Twitter.
64

64

00:04:23.253  -->  00:04:25.920
The next one is for Google Plus,
65

65

00:04:31.693  -->  00:04:33.943
and one last for Instagram.
66

66

00:04:40.900  -->  00:04:42.212
And here we go.
67

67

00:04:42.212  -->  00:04:44.629
So these are our navigations.
68

68

00:04:45.776  -->  00:04:50.264
And now we usually have a paragraph as well,
69

69

00:04:50.264  -->  00:04:54.005
where we have for instance some fancy text
70

70

00:04:54.005  -->  00:04:57.001
about copyright or something like that.
71

71

00:04:57.001  -->  00:05:00.168
And so let's include another row here,
72

72

00:05:01.042  -->  00:05:03.292
where we can put some text.
73

73

00:05:07.873  -->  00:05:12.040
And in here, as I said, I will put just a paragraph,
74

74

00:05:13.050  -->  00:05:16.550
and we can write something like copyright,
75

75

00:05:18.477  -->  00:05:23.413
and then we use a nice symbol as well, which is called copy,
76

76

00:05:23.413  -->  00:05:26.374
you'll have obviously seen this in many places.
77

77

00:05:26.374  -->  00:05:30.541
So it's the copyright symbol, then 2015 by Omnifood.
78

78

00:05:33.568  -->  00:05:35.507
Of course this is not the case because Omnifood
79

79

00:05:35.507  -->  00:05:39.507
is not a real company, but it's just to show you
80

80

00:05:42.882  -->  00:05:45.299
what this usually looks like.
81

81

00:05:48.006  -->  00:05:52.173
So Omnifood created this in 2015, and it's their website.
82

82

00:05:54.176  -->  00:05:55.009
All right.
83

83

00:05:57.520  -->  00:06:01.444
So we can now check what this looks like in the browser
84

84

00:06:01.444  -->  00:06:05.611
on our webpage, and we see our new section down here.
85

85

00:06:08.120  -->  00:06:10.465
So this looks of course a little weird,
86

86

00:06:10.465  -->  00:06:15.259
because it comes with the link styling we defined before.
87

87

00:06:15.259  -->  00:06:18.926
So the style of this is like this right now,
88

88

00:06:20.566  -->  00:06:22.225
because it's the generic link styling
89

89

00:06:22.225  -->  00:06:24.142
that we defined before.
90

90

00:06:25.127  -->  00:06:27.369
So we have to change this,
91

91

00:06:27.369  -->  00:06:29.528
and we have to format all of this,
92

92

00:06:29.528  -->  00:06:32.721
and put these links side by side,
93

93

00:06:32.721  -->  00:06:36.888
and we're gonna do all of this in the next lecture.
