00:00:02,372  -->  00:00:04,144
<v Voiceover>Hello back.</v>
2

2

00:00:04,144  -->  00:00:06,595
Before we move on to the next section,
3

3

00:00:06,595  -->  00:00:08,165
I want to show you a very important
4

4

00:00:08,165  -->  00:00:10,640
tool for every web developer.
5

5

00:00:10,640  -->  00:00:13,377
Google Chrome Developer Tools.
6

6

00:00:13,377  -->  00:00:15,691
These powerful tools are built right into
7

7

00:00:15,691  -->  00:00:18,000
Google Chrome and can be used to analyze
8

8

00:00:18,000  -->  00:00:20,724
and correct HTML CSS codes,
9

9

00:00:20,724  -->  00:00:24,605
to optimize our web page, and so much more.
10

10

00:00:24,605  -->  00:00:27,340
Also, remember what I told you earlier?
11

11

00:00:27,340  -->  00:00:29,921
About learning about other web pages?
12

12

00:00:29,921  -->  00:00:33,171
Here is the right tool to do just that.
13

13

00:00:34,349  -->  00:00:35,622
So let's see how we can use the
14

14

00:00:35,622  -->  00:00:37,539
Chrome Developer Tools.
15

15

00:00:39,413  -->  00:00:43,227
Actually, if I just open the developer tools
16

16

00:00:43,227  -->  00:00:45,183
in the window which has the a live
17

17

00:00:45,183  -->  00:00:47,285
connection with brackets, which is
18

18

00:00:47,285  -->  00:00:49,150
exactly this one.
19

19

00:00:49,150  -->  00:00:51,534
That connection will get lost.
20

20

00:00:51,534  -->  00:00:53,127
That is pretty annoying.
21

21

00:00:53,127  -->  00:00:56,810
But instead I can open the HTML file
22

22

00:00:56,810  -->  00:00:58,067
in the usual way,
23

23

00:00:58,067  -->  00:01:00,900
and then none of that will happen.
24

24

00:01:03,150  -->  00:01:05,567
So I'll just open the folder,
25

25

00:01:07,175  -->  00:01:10,750
and here are all the files we created so far.
26

26

00:01:10,750  -->  00:01:14,083
And I will open this with Google Chrome.
27

27

00:01:16,299  -->  00:01:17,935
And here we go.
28

28

00:01:17,935  -->  00:01:20,286
Now the Google Chrome Developer Tools
29

29

00:01:20,286  -->  00:01:23,888
are all about inspecting elements.
30

30

00:01:23,888  -->  00:01:26,221
So if we click, right click,
31

31

00:01:27,110  -->  00:01:30,738
here on this main heading page one element,
32

32

00:01:30,738  -->  00:01:33,521
and hit inspect element,
33

33

00:01:33,521  -->  00:01:36,354
we see the Chrome tools down here.
34

34

00:01:37,702  -->  00:01:41,472
And this is the H1 element I just selected.
35

35

00:01:41,472  -->  00:01:45,041
So here we have all the HTML code
36

36

00:01:45,041  -->  00:01:48,674
and as we hover the different elements
37

37

00:01:48,674  -->  00:01:51,762
you see that in Google Chrome is shows us
38

38

00:01:51,762  -->  00:01:54,429
which element we are inspecting.
39

39

00:01:57,453  -->  00:01:58,655
Down on the right side,
40

40

00:01:58,655  -->  00:02:01,496
we have all the CSS properties.
41

41

00:02:01,496  -->  00:02:03,996
And you can turn these off, on
42

42

00:02:06,234  -->  00:02:07,817
to see what happens
43

43

00:02:09,592  -->  00:02:10,995
if these properties
44

44

00:02:10,995  -->  00:02:13,137
are active or not active.
45

45

00:02:13,137  -->  00:02:16,470
Here we can actually change some things.
46

46

00:02:17,771  -->  00:02:20,438
Say you want this 45 or 48 or 60
47

47

00:02:23,021  -->  00:02:25,521
just to see how it looks like.
48

48

00:02:28,024  -->  00:02:30,691
Of course, none of these changes
49

49

00:02:31,541  -->  00:02:34,429
will be reflected in the actual code
50

50

00:02:34,429  -->  00:02:37,762
which means if I just refresh this page,
51

51

00:02:38,760  -->  00:02:42,528
it looks exactly as it looked before.
52

52

00:02:42,528  -->  00:02:43,851
Another useful thing,
53

53

00:02:43,851  -->  00:02:45,482
is when I have this selected,
54

54

00:02:45,482  -->  00:02:47,612
you see that the H1 element test,
55

55

00:02:47,612  -->  00:02:50,904
this blue area, which is the content,
56

56

00:02:50,904  -->  00:02:52,645
remember, the box model?
57

57

00:02:52,645  -->  00:02:54,634
So the blue is the content,
58

58

00:02:54,634  -->  00:02:57,384
and the orange one is the margin.
59

59

00:02:58,834  -->  00:03:01,584
So that orange is these 20 pixels
60

60

00:03:02,945  -->  00:03:04,695
margin bottom, right?
61

61

00:03:08,298  -->  00:03:10,669
And this is the blog post div,
62

62

00:03:10,669  -->  00:03:13,454
and if you remember we set a right
63

63

00:03:13,454  -->  00:03:15,569
petting to 30 pixels.
64

64

00:03:15,569  -->  00:03:19,319
And that 30 pixels is that green area we see.
65

65

00:03:21,833  -->  00:03:24,055
So this can be pretty useful.
66

66

00:03:24,055  -->  00:03:26,312
And actually we have the box model
67

67

00:03:26,312  -->  00:03:27,562
also down here.
68

68

00:03:29,459  -->  00:03:31,628
So when we have the bigger web page
69

69

00:03:31,628  -->  00:03:33,151
this can be pretty useful
70

70

00:03:33,151  -->  00:03:35,234
inspect all our elements.
71

71

00:03:37,713  -->  00:03:39,713
So this is our web page.
72

72

00:03:41,978  -->  00:03:45,577
Now remember we can also do the same thing
73

73

00:03:45,577  -->  00:03:48,994
with other websites to see how they work.
74

74

00:03:51,066  -->  00:03:54,234
This is the square website that I used before.
75

75

00:03:54,234  -->  00:03:56,317
And some design lectures.
76

76

00:03:57,326  -->  00:03:58,750
Imagine, you want to know
77

77

00:03:58,750  -->  00:04:01,229
how this button here works.
78

78

00:04:01,229  -->  00:04:03,229
We'll do inspect element
79

79

00:04:04,965  -->  00:04:07,048
and then I have the code.
80

80

00:04:08,115  -->  00:04:10,858
The HTML code, is here on the right side,
81

81

00:04:10,858  -->  00:04:14,018
you can see the HTML attributes.
82

82

00:04:14,018  -->  00:04:16,851
The color, the background color...
83

83

00:04:17,849  -->  00:04:20,844
So these strike through here,
84

84

00:04:20,844  -->  00:04:24,583
means that this property is not active.
85

85

00:04:24,583  -->  00:04:25,966
It means that it has been overwritten
86

86

00:04:25,966  -->  00:04:27,466
by something else.
87

87

00:04:29,652  -->  00:04:31,440
So the background color, we can turn it
88

88

00:04:31,440  -->  00:04:34,190
off and on, and see what happens.
89

89

00:04:35,797  -->  00:04:37,714
And, what else is here?
90

90

00:04:40,584  -->  00:04:42,048
So just the margin,
91

91

00:04:42,048  -->  00:04:44,881
we can turn it off and on as well.
92

92

00:04:46,144  -->  00:04:47,854
And here we see, for example,
93

93

00:04:47,854  -->  00:04:49,341
that this button has a border rate
94

94

00:04:49,341  -->  00:04:52,758
at three pixels, if you were just curious
95

95

00:04:54,514  -->  00:04:56,634
how this was designed.
96

96

00:04:56,634  -->  00:04:59,670
And the font family is square market.
97

97

00:04:59,670  -->  00:05:02,253
And the font size is 11 pixels.
98

98

00:05:04,048  -->  00:05:06,517
So you see, this is pretty useful
99

99

00:05:06,517  -->  00:05:08,799
to find out about anything
100

100

00:05:08,799  -->  00:05:11,636
that you want to know on other webpages.
101

101

00:05:11,636  -->  00:05:14,219
For example, like this element,
102

102

00:05:16,504  -->  00:05:17,751
here you see...
103

103

00:05:17,751  -->  00:05:20,584
You can inspect all the HTML code.
104

104

00:05:22,354  -->  00:05:24,410
So you have different divs here.
105

105

00:05:24,410  -->  00:05:26,243
And then this extreme,
106

106

00:05:27,811  -->  00:05:29,644
this particular color.
107

107

00:05:31,218  -->  00:05:34,518
And, you know, I use this a lot
108

108

00:05:34,518  -->  00:05:37,826
to see what other websites are doing right.
109

109

00:05:37,826  -->  00:05:42,393
Okay, this was just the very basic introduction
110

110

00:05:42,393  -->  00:05:44,554
but we will see more applications
111

111

00:05:44,554  -->  00:05:47,221
of the developer tools later on.
112

112

00:05:48,323  -->  00:05:50,793
And this was actually the last lecture
113

113

00:05:50,793  -->  00:05:53,893
in the introductory CSS section.
114

114

00:05:53,893  -->  00:05:56,861
Wow, you have learned such a lot so far.
115

115

00:05:56,861  -->  00:05:58,796
Congratulations!
116

116

00:05:58,796  -->  00:06:01,159
And I'm really, really happy and grateful
117

117

00:06:01,159  -->  00:06:03,945
that you're still with me on this journey.
118

118

00:06:03,945  -->  00:06:05,700
You're good to go for our killer website
119

119

00:06:05,700  -->  00:06:09,212
project that we will start in a moment.
120

120

00:06:09,212  -->  00:06:11,291
But wait, first I have another
121

121

00:06:11,291  -->  00:06:14,175
nice little quiz for you again.
122

122

00:06:14,175  -->  00:06:15,450
Good luck with that,
123

123

00:06:15,450  -->  00:06:18,117
and see you in the next section.
