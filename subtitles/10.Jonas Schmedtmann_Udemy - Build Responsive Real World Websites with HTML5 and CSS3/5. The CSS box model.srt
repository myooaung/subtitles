00:00:01,652  -->  00:00:03,071
<v Voiceover>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,071  -->  00:00:05,177
I will now quickly go over yet another
3

3

00:00:05,177  -->  00:00:07,677
very important concept in CSS.
4

4

00:00:08,543  -->  00:00:09,710
The box model.
5

5

00:00:11,967  -->  00:00:13,000
So.
6

6

00:00:13,000  -->  00:00:17,167
Basically, all HTML elements can be seen as boxes.
7

7

00:00:18,180  -->  00:00:19,602
What the box model does
8

8

00:00:19,602  -->  00:00:21,882
is to allow us to define space
9

9

00:00:21,882  -->  00:00:23,273
between elements
10

10

00:00:23,273  -->  00:00:26,824
and to add a border around elements.
11

11

00:00:26,824  -->  00:00:29,308
The box model consists of margins,
12

12

00:00:29,308  -->  00:00:33,666
padding, borders and actual content of the box.
13

13

00:00:33,666  -->  00:00:35,249
For instance, text.
14

14

00:00:36,549  -->  00:00:41,293
This image shows very well how the box model works.
15

15

00:00:41,293  -->  00:00:42,846
So,
16

16

00:00:42,846  -->  00:00:46,723
the content is where text and images appear.
17

17

00:00:46,723  -->  00:00:50,823
Padding is like a transparent area around the content,
18

18

00:00:50,823  -->  00:00:52,656
but inside of the box.
19

19

00:00:53,645  -->  00:00:55,193
The border of the box
20

20

00:00:55,193  -->  00:00:57,631
goes around the padding and the content.
21

21

00:00:57,631  -->  00:01:00,131
It may be transparent, or not.
22

22

00:01:01,135  -->  00:01:05,543
And finally, the margin is the space between boxes.
23

23

00:01:05,543  -->  00:01:08,126
Now, padding, margin and border
24

24

00:01:09,368  -->  00:01:11,745
are properties in CSS,
25

25

00:01:11,745  -->  00:01:14,939
and can be specified for the entire box
26

26

00:01:14,939  -->  00:01:17,735
or for individual sides.
27

27

00:01:17,735  -->  00:01:19,985
Top, bottom, left or right.
28

28

00:01:21,439  -->  00:01:23,772
We'll use all of them later.
29

29

00:01:25,970  -->  00:01:28,757
The box model also allows us to set
30

30

00:01:28,757  -->  00:01:32,574
the height and the width of an element.
31

31

00:01:32,574  -->  00:01:36,145
Now, the annoying thing about the standard box model
32

32

00:01:36,145  -->  00:01:37,939
that I just showed you
33

33

00:01:37,939  -->  00:01:39,775
is that you just set the height
34

34

00:01:39,775  -->  00:01:42,178
and the width of the content.
35

35

00:01:42,178  -->  00:01:44,595
Not of the entire box itself.
36

36

00:01:45,577  -->  00:01:48,833
This means that padding, margin and border
37

37

00:01:48,833  -->  00:01:53,578
will be added to the height and width we specify.
38

38

00:01:53,578  -->  00:01:56,970
Which is actually not what we want.
39

39

00:01:56,970  -->  00:01:58,544
But fortunately,
40

40

00:01:58,544  -->  00:02:00,850
we have a good solution for that.
41

41

00:02:00,850  -->  00:02:03,661
There is this very useful CSS property
42

42

00:02:03,661  -->  00:02:05,161
called box-sizing.
43

43

00:02:06,177  -->  00:02:09,053
If we set box-sizing to border-box,
44

44

00:02:09,053  -->  00:02:11,021
the height and the width
45

45

00:02:11,021  -->  00:02:14,320
will be defined for the entire box.
46

46

00:02:14,320  -->  00:02:16,737
We will use this in a second.
47

47

00:02:18,393  -->  00:02:20,047
'Cause there is one last thing
48

48

00:02:20,047  -->  00:02:23,190
I need to tell you about the box model.
49

49

00:02:23,190  -->  00:02:26,193
In HTML, there are block elements
50

50

00:02:26,193  -->  00:02:27,860
and inline elements.
51

51

00:02:28,949  -->  00:02:32,432
Block elements use the full width of the browser
52

52

00:02:32,432  -->  00:02:34,463
and force line breaks.
53

53

00:02:34,463  -->  00:02:38,630
Headings and paragraphs are examples of block elements.
54

54

00:02:40,889  -->  00:02:44,494
And inline elements don't do any of that.
55

55

00:02:44,494  -->  00:02:45,650
For instance,
56

56

00:02:45,650  -->  00:02:48,733
images, links, strong and em elements
57

57

00:02:50,076  -->  00:02:52,076
are all inline elements.
58

58

00:02:53,139  -->  00:02:54,890
What's important about them
59

59

00:02:54,890  -->  00:02:59,057
is that you can either set their height or their width.
60

60

00:02:59,948  -->  00:03:02,485
But enough with theory lectures.
61

61

00:03:02,485  -->  00:03:05,347
Let's get our hands dirty with what we just learned
62

62

00:03:05,347  -->  00:03:07,430
and get back to brackets.
63

63

00:03:09,198  -->  00:03:10,543
As you can see,
64

64

00:03:10,543  -->  00:03:12,342
on our web page
65

65

00:03:12,342  -->  00:03:14,619
here in Google Chrome,
66

66

00:03:14,619  -->  00:03:18,407
there are already some margins between elements.
67

67

00:03:18,407  -->  00:03:20,208
For example this one here,
68

68

00:03:20,208  -->  00:03:21,291
and this one.
69

69

00:03:22,817  -->  00:03:24,828
It all full of margins,
70

70

00:03:24,828  -->  00:03:25,749
already.
71

71

00:03:25,749  -->  00:03:28,061
And that's because all browsers
72

72

00:03:28,061  -->  00:03:29,806
add some default margins
73

73

00:03:29,806  -->  00:03:32,289
if we don't specify any.
74

74

00:03:32,289  -->  00:03:36,127
So let's start by remove the default values.
75

75

00:03:36,127  -->  00:03:37,307
And to do that,
76

76

00:03:37,307  -->  00:03:38,848
we create some rules
77

77

00:03:38,848  -->  00:03:41,891
that will affect all elements on our web page,
78

78

00:03:41,891  -->  00:03:44,224
using the asterisk selector.
79

79

00:03:45,663  -->  00:03:47,413
Which goes like this.
80

80

00:03:48,400  -->  00:03:50,688
So we just type this.
81

81

00:03:50,688  -->  00:03:53,188
Now all elements are affected.
82

82

00:03:54,358  -->  00:03:57,858
That's why you have these blue boxes here,
83

83

00:03:59,094  -->  00:04:01,094
around all the elements.
84

84

00:04:02,310  -->  00:04:04,344
This is a way of brackets showing us
85

85

00:04:04,344  -->  00:04:06,795
that all these elements are affected
86

86

00:04:06,795  -->  00:04:08,212
by this selector.
87

87

00:04:09,218  -->  00:04:13,002
Now, here we've set all margins and paddings to 0.
88

88

00:04:13,002  -->  00:04:14,691
And that's how it works.
89

89

00:04:14,691  -->  00:04:16,441
Just write margin: 0;
90

90

00:04:19,204  -->  00:04:20,954
and also padding: 0;.
91

91

00:04:24,866  -->  00:04:29,259
So you see, all the margins completely disappeared.
92

92

00:04:29,259  -->  00:04:32,683
Now, do you remember the box-sizing property?
93

93

00:04:32,683  -->  00:04:34,588
We want to set it to border-box
94

94

00:04:34,588  -->  00:04:35,968
for all elements.
95

95

00:04:35,968  -->  00:04:37,945
And this is the right place
96

96

00:04:37,945  -->  00:04:39,932
to do exactly that.
97

97

00:04:39,932  -->  00:04:40,765
So.
98

98

00:04:41,852  -->  00:04:43,769
Let's write box-sizing,
99

99

00:04:45,482  -->  00:04:47,732
and then choose border-box.
100

100

00:04:50,820  -->  00:04:52,287
Save it,
101

101

00:04:52,287  -->  00:04:53,287
and alright.
102

102

00:04:54,777  -->  00:04:58,027
So, no margins and no paddings anymore.
103

103

00:04:59,079  -->  00:05:01,216
Now, I think we should add some margins
104

104

00:05:01,216  -->  00:05:03,713
to some of the elements.
105

105

00:05:03,713  -->  00:05:05,342
First, I would say
106

106

00:05:05,342  -->  00:05:09,549
that the main heading needs some margin, right?
107

107

00:05:09,549  -->  00:05:12,099
This main heading right here.
108

108

00:05:12,099  -->  00:05:13,390
So remember.
109

109

00:05:13,390  -->  00:05:16,723
Margin is the white space between boxes.
110

110

00:05:17,982  -->  00:05:20,901
We want some margin these two headings,
111

111

00:05:20,901  -->  00:05:23,494
the h1 and the h2 heading.
112

112

00:05:23,494  -->  00:05:27,161
So we add a margin-bottom to the h1 element.
113

113

00:05:28,674  -->  00:05:31,338
So if we remember, I said we could specify
114

114

00:05:31,338  -->  00:05:34,921
the margins to all the sides of an element.
115

115

00:05:36,596  -->  00:05:37,513
And so now,
116

116

00:05:39,519  -->  00:05:42,852
I will specify the margin at the bottom.
117

117

00:05:45,886  -->  00:05:47,886
And let's put 20px here.
118

118

00:05:51,129  -->  00:05:55,296
That looks like a reasonable amount of white space here.
119

119

00:06:00,282  -->  00:06:03,904
And now the same thing for the secondary headings.
120

120

00:06:03,904  -->  00:06:07,011
Because, you know, I also don't like
121

121

00:06:07,011  -->  00:06:10,522
that there's no space between the h2 element
122

122

00:06:10,522  -->  00:06:12,105
and the paragraphs.
123

123

00:06:13,521  -->  00:06:16,600
So it's again, margin-bottom.
124

124

00:06:16,600  -->  00:06:19,850
And here, I think 10px might be enough.
125

125

00:06:22,051  -->  00:06:23,211
Okay.
126

126

00:06:23,211  -->  00:06:27,028
That looks much better, don't you think?
127

127

00:06:27,028  -->  00:06:30,347
Finally, I would like to add some margin
128

128

00:06:30,347  -->  00:06:32,514
after the main paragraphs.
129

129

00:06:33,503  -->  00:06:34,642
So if you remember,
130

130

00:06:34,642  -->  00:06:36,237
the main paragraphs are
131

131

00:06:36,237  -->  00:06:37,497
this one
132

132

00:06:37,497  -->  00:06:39,125
and this one.
133

133

00:06:39,125  -->  00:06:42,348
And we defined it in the lecture before,
134

134

00:06:42,348  -->  00:06:44,181
using this class here.
135

135

00:06:45,892  -->  00:06:47,892
So again, margin-bottom.
136

136

00:06:49,404  -->  00:06:51,154
And let's do it 20px.
137

137

00:06:52,847  -->  00:06:56,270
So we get some nice spacing here.
138

138

00:06:56,270  -->  00:07:00,005
So it looks a little bit cleaner right now.
139

139

00:07:00,005  -->  00:07:02,157
And that's it for this lecture.
140

140

00:07:02,157  -->  00:07:05,338
I hope you learned a lot about the box model.
141

141

00:07:05,338  -->  00:07:07,743
Which is really, really important.
142

142

00:07:07,743  -->  00:07:09,738
So if you didn't, just go back
143

143

00:07:09,738  -->  00:07:11,431
and look at it again.
144

144

00:07:11,431  -->  00:07:13,022
Because in the next lecture,
145

145

00:07:13,022  -->  00:07:14,629
we will really need it
146

146

00:07:14,629  -->  00:07:18,808
because we will start to build a simple layout,
147

147

00:07:18,808  -->  00:07:21,225
where we will use the concept
148

148

00:07:22,096  -->  00:07:24,949
that I showed you in this lecture.
149

149

00:07:24,949  -->  00:07:25,954
So,
150

150

00:07:25,954  -->  00:07:27,121
see you there.
