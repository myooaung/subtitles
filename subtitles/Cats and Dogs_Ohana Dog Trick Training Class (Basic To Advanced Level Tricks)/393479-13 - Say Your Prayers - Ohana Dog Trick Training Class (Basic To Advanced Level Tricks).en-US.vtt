00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720
Hi.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.350
Ever back to the online Ohana dog training course.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.210
I'm here today with my friends Stoke.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.580
And today we're going to show you how to train your dog to say their prayers.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.950
So I like to start by luring him up into a position.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:33.150
But so I'm going to reward him first for putting his paws up.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.070
And then I'm going to pull the tree right in between his elbows.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.600
Front line reward.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.080
Right there.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.470
Yes.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.500
So same thing.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.850
I'm just gonna repeat that,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:55.710
and I'm gonna reward him as he places his face between his paws.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.210
Yes.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.750
So ready.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:12.250
Ready?

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.750
Right.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.820
Stoke!

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.650
Right here.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.050
Good boy.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.960
You know,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.570
reward him while he's in that position.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.070
Okay?

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.440
No,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.050
release him.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:40.630
Then I will ask him to put his paws up again and rewards right in between legs.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:02:00.350
You can also practise this trick on your arm instead of a platform,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.870
which is what I prefer to dio That way,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.250
I'll have to carry your own props all the time.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.980
So ready?

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:22.760
No good.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.100
Good.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:35.690
So there's why Eventually you want to start fading that food more out.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.550
So you're just using your hand to lure them instead of food paws up.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.200
Yes,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.030
and then I'll reward.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.500
I want a little more duration as I continue to practice this trick hurt.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.110
First say yes.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.050
Good boy.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:07.050
And I'll reward him in that position first.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.050
Yeah.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.350
Good boy.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.580
You just want to keep practicing Over time,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.950
you should eventually just be able to fade out the hand signals.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.790
And when you ask them paws up,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.050
you can say first first,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.350
just like that.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.540
All right,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.960
everyone.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.450
Hope you enjoyed this video.
