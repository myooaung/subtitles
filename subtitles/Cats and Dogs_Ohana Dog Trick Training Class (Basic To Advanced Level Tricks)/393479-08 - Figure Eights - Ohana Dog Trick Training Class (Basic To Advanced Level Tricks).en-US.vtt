00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
Hello,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.950
everyone.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.320
And welcome back to the online Ohana dog training floors.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.980
I'm here today with my friends,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.600
Stokely,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.700
and we're going to show you how to do a very simple and fun trick.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.970
This trick is that factory.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.750
What?

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.870
That's boy.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.090
All right,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.750
so how you want to start teaching?

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.700
This trick is very soon.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.950
Start with the food lower every similar to the leg.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.150
We just simply lure your dog drooling around.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.340
You're gonna reward once they come around your first leg,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.850
take him around the office and reward.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.750
Might want to lean into it a little bit when you're first starting.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.230
So yes,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.650
very good.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.490
Sure.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.740
Again,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.750
just assure you again.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.650
Yeah.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.540
Good.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.930
Full.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.850
Once you dog starts to understand the concept,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.030
you start feeding.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.900
Blew out a little bit back.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.970
Just lean into it.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.890
Ideally,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.350
you still want to be rewarding,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.900
right?

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.940
He's just more experienced.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.300
He already knows this trick.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.220
And that's why I'm not rewarding him as much once your dog understands the concept of what

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.850
they're doing.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.940
Yeah.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.080
So,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.410
Mike,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.660
you for this particular drink,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.300
it's go figure Stoke Ego Finger.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.050
Why reward him?

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.900
Thank you.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.840
Yes,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.050
very good.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.150
Once you have picks it up.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.710
It should look something like this,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.200
right?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.400
Ah,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.980
very good.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.920
Nice job,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.550
but good job.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.150
All right,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.580
sits.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.440
Use it.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.800
Pretty.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.280
Say goodbye to my guys.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.050
Hope to see in that video.
