00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
Hi,

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.950
everyone.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.970
Welcome back to the online Ohana Dog training pots.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.250
Is this my friends stoke here today.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.780
Good lying!

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.720
And today we're gonna be showing you teach how to sit Pretty start.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:33.820
I like to take my yes lines.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.750
We just want to repeat this a bunch of times in the beginning.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.590
Ask for a whole lot in duration because it is kind of an awkward position when you first

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.150
start out.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.870
He already knows how to do this.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.650
So he's already developed his score.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.130
Wait.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.800
Yes.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.550
We lure them up just like that,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.850
just for a second or so.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.920
A se start to develop their balance a little more.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.400
You want to start holding it for a little bit longer?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.050
Barely.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.250
You can also feed most treats to encourage them to stay in that position longer.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:23.790
I good keep in mind this isn't a trick that I learned in a day usually takes months for

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.110
them.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.150
Teoh develop that core strength to really start sitting pretty and less awkward after a

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.850
couple months.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.270
But you really want to be practicing it every day.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.850
That way they're really developing their course string.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.650
Yeah,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.050
Okay.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.170
Everything.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.640
If you're having trouble flooring them up in the not position or you have a bigger dog.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.410
You can actually start with them in between your legs.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.320
We'll put him into a sit,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.550
and I will just push the treat back.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.930
Yes,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.990
God will reward him when he sits Pretty good.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.210
This is usually an easier way to do it with some of the bigger dogs.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.420
Uh,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.350
good.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.570
And eventually,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.260
the goal is to have a sit Pretty.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.320
That looks Uh huh.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:42.590
Thanks for watching guys look for to seeing next video.
