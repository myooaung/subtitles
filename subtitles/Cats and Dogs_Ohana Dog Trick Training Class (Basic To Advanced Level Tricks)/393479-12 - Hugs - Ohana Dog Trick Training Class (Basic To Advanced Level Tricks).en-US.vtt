00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.330
Hi,

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.990
everyone.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.610
Welcome back to the online Ohana dog training class.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.970
I'm here again today with my friend renegade.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.150
Wait,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.050
it's day we're gonna show you how to train your dog to give you a hot.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:31.190
So I have rented a on his time clap for but easier to teach dog this trick,

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.350
they're elevated instead of just trying to teach them on the ground.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.540
So I like to start off right in front of my dog.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.620
Then I will literally just take the food and lower him right up.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.100
Yes,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.450
And once he's on my shoulder,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.190
I'm Mark and reward that behavior.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.720
All right,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.010
so I'm gonna lure him back off,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.920
and we're gonna try again.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.980
Yes,

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.950
very good.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.170
We're just going to repeat this a bunch of time until he understands what he's doing.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.820
Very good cake.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.280
So,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.690
ideally,

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.210
I want to be sitting when he does this.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.970
Good boy.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:25.950
Stay.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.850
Okay.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.450
Does it a couple just marking a reward.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.250
That behaviour whenever he puts his paws up on my shoulder.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.250
Plus it,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.510
boy,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.200
once you're on the idea that they're supposed to have their paws over you,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.450
you could start to lure them or to the side so it's more like a hawk.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.350
Wait,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.090
Ugur Se se.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.050
So I'm gonna lose or more over here this time you can do it.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.080
I'm gonna try to get him.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.890
So he's actually got his pause wrapped around me.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.120
Little thing.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.250
Get it,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.150
Get it?

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.970
Yes.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.190
Go,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.620
boy.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.410
That's what I wanted to see.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.420
How he's got one pawn each side.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.750
Now,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.780
that's what I ultimately want for this behavior.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.680
When I tell him hug,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.720
I want him to actually wrap his paws around me,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.450
and he's doing so good right now.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.250
Boy,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.620
try it again.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:52.950
Just try to little bit here.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.230
You're right.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.950
It's over here.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:14.750
You felt se get it?

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.610
Yeah,

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.060
it's good,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.950
boy.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.780
All right,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.250
Dragon.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.150
Ready.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.450
All right,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.950
does it?

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:46.650
Nobody friends right here.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.290
Well,

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.360
you could do it there,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.850
close friend.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.130
Good boy.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.330
That's where I want his feet.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.890
So it's definitely a little awkward in the beginning,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.850
but with lots of practice,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.510
your dog should learn how to give you a hug whenever you're cute.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.750
All right.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.590
Thank you for watching.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.950
Guys.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.340
Hope to see you in the next video briefly with
