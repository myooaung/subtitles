00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.890
Hello,

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.450
everyone.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.960
And welcome back to the online Ohana dog training course.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.100
I'm here today with my friend Fathom the golden retriever.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.440
And today we're going to show you how to train your dog to put their paws up on a box or a

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.070
platform.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.750
So I'm gonna take my food lure here,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.150
and I'm just gonna worry about him.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:41.710
Gonna start holding the lure directly in front of his nose and literally just clicking and

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.340
rewarding him when he puts his two paws up on the box.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.450
Really sharing it?

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.940
Yes.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.450
Very good.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.580
Positive.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.970
What a good boy.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.220
If your dog is reluctant to put their paws on the box,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.050
you can try feeding to get more comfortable.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.150
So what I like to do is something Sprinkle food on.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.620
He's very comfortable with getting on it.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.300
As you can see,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.950
just Sprinkle food just like that.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.530
Good boy.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.830
And just consistently,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.410
dear,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.450
rewarding them on that box or platform or whatever it is you're using.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.250
Good boy.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:38.380
Once your dog starts to get more than hang of it,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.180
you start to fade out the food lure.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.350
Hi.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.550
Here,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.860
then reward them while they have their two front paws on the box,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.650
you start to build a little more distance between you and the dog steak.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.670
Good.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.480
So I'm actually asking him to stay with his two front paws on that.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.230
Like I said,

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.550
just start to feed the food out over time,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.490
um,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.950
start to build a little more distance and eventually should just be able to point out the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.730
box and have your dog put there to front paws.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.290
Once your dog learns this behavior,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.350
you should be able to just point out the object and stay positive,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.820
and they'll put their paws up.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.370
Good boy,

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.550
just like that.
