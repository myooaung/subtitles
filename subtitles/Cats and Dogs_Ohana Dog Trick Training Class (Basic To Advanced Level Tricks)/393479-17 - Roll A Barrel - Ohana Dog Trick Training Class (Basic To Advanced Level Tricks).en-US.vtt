00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.510
Now,

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.640
when I'm teaching barrel,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.150
I like to start covering up with or your dog already has paws up to You can use that.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.550
And I just like to reward on the barrel to get them comfortable with way.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.450
Very good.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.430
You want to get them really comfortable with the movement of the barrel underneath their

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.050
paws?

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.220
Not when they're not afraid of it or startled by it.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.950
Good boy.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:40.910
You can also feed off the barrel to encourage them to stay up on it.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.830
Uh,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.310
it also makes the barrel very reinforcing.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.750
Good.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.460
Okay,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.250
Ready?

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:00.090
Been footprint.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.050
What's your,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.050
uh oh,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.070
very good.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.500
That's awesome.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:21.050
But the next step is to actually get them used to moving the barrel forward with their hot

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.790
Boise.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.180
Roll it forward a bit to encourage them to move their back flags.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.680
Good job.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.250
Bread.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.750
Just moving a bit more.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.830
Yes.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.650
Reward.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.000
Try again.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.380
Let's go a little bit further this month.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.000
Like Thanks.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.140
Yeah,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.360
job.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.610
Renegade boy.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.560
Once they're comfortable with the barrel moving forward underneath their feet,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.530
that's the time you can actually start to let them move it on their own.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.300
So I'm literally just luring him with the food.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.660
I'm letting him move the barrel on his own.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.210
I'm not helping him in any way other than the lure here.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.120
Yeah,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.550
good boy.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.350
That's trying.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.270
You do a lot of encouragement is good for this.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.710
Helps keep the movie if they come.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.320
Apps aside.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.820
That's okay.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.850
You just want to redirect them back to the center.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.290
Because that's where you want them to be,

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.860
ideally,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.950
to push the very I got a boy.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.850
Let's keep going.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.320
Try good.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:01.550
Very good.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.150
You really want to see them Trying to move it and roll it with their front paws as well is

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.250
moving their back process.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:18.230
So that's something you want to see you when you're reinforcing them is a bit harder on

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.590
grass.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.640
So if you have a driveway,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.010
you canoe.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.340
This one,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.770
that's what usually a little easier.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:50.480
Your job can always pull the food up with that higher and that will encourage them to move

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.280
their laws.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.850
I really want to see that rolling motion.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:05.740
Okay,

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.350
That's right.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.340
No,

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.210
you can do it.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.900
Come on.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.800
Right?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.440
Yes.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.450
Good boy.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.840
Yes.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.470
Ready barrel.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.130
Yes.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.910
Good barrel.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.810
Figuring it out there.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.460
Yes,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.700
apply just like that.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.220
That was awesome,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.550
buddy.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.450
All right.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.930
You eventually want to start feeding that Lower out.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.920
So this time I'm gonna try with no food or he hasn't practiced this trick.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.840
You can tell,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.420
right?

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.020
Yes.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.620
Good boy.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.540
Good boy going?

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.660
Yes.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.270
Yes,

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.410
that was awesome.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.560
So he's not moving it too far.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.520
This is the beginning phase of training.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.390
That that's okay.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.260
You can build on that and you can start to increase the distance.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.440
Is your dog progresses?

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.600
Um,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.510
the main thing is,

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.550
you want to get them,

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.310
uh,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.180
off the food as soon as possible,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.460
but,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.180
um,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.650
just have fun with your That's the most important.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.930
All right,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.190
guys,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.550
