00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440
next,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.040
Tiki and I are gonna be showing you how to train your dog.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.650
Jump into your arms.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.490
So you first want to start out saying in a chair with your dog sitting next to you,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.850
and you want to encourage them to jump up onto your lap.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.820
Good.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.930
And you want to reinforce them when they do jump up onto your lock.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.360
So once again,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.310
good girl.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.580
Okay.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.750
Today ready?

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.750
The next step you want to try is so lowering your dog on your lap,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.850
but this time jump up for you.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.400
Reward them.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.350
You want to grab them and kind of hug them to you.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.030
Try again.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.280
That way.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.230
There being reinforced for you grabbing them,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.400
which will eventually be the final step in this truck.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.570
You're gonna be standing and grab your dog for them to jump into your arms.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.950
Right?

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.850
So once again,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.700
grab in reward work time.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.770
But,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.810
uh,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.880
good.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.450
Good job.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.970
Once your dog understands that you can add a verbal,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.850
you find his arms ready.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.120
Arms?

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.380
Good.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.850
So she really understand?

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.450
Understands what she's doing.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.150
Come good.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.350
All right.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.780
Once your dog has got that down and they understand what the verbal cue means you can

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.950
actually start to stand up and you give them your hand signal to jump into your arms.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.570
I would lean down a little bit squad if you have to,

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:12.740
but good job wanting position for good.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.350
Sit.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.600
Tell her.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.680
Yeah,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.160
Good.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.450
Good job.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.050
Ready.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.510
Once you're really understands what they're doing,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.870
you could move to the final stuff,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.150
which is standing up tall,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.720
holding your arms out.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.720
Yeah.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.510
Good girl.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.150
And having them jump up into your arms.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.370
So one more time,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.720
Tiki.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.250
Ready?

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.750
Let's do this again,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.970
girl.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.150
Ready set.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:56.200
Good.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.660
That's about all for now,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.190
guys.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.850
Looking forward to seeing in the next video.
