00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
Hi,

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.780
everyone.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.870
Welcome back to the online Ohana.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.210
Dog training tricks,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:11.750
colors.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.390
I'm here again today with my great battle,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.250
and we're gonna be showing you how to teach your dog out a week.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.050
So to start,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.200
I would wave your dog first.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.350
Have to know how to give Hall what you should have learned in the previous video.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.580
Um,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.840
after your dog is already getting their paw 100% of the time when you ask them for it,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.050
that's a good time to start teaching wave.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.330
So I'm gonna just reach my hand out.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.150
What?

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.590
But I'm gonna pull away work.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.230
He actually is able to place his pawn when I pulled away.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.500
And he makes awaiting motion.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.910
That's when I click and reward.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.200
So he knows he's getting rewarded for lifting his con.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.670
The area?

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.860
No,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.210
he's not necessarily touching again.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.710
Yes,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.890
but why?

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.150
You gradually want to start pulling your hand more and more up.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.950
Why?

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.020
And that we're talking higher.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.450
Higher.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.770
Good boy.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.320
Yeah,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.950
it's good.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.050
A little higher that time.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.440
What more of a waving motion,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.750
though.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.250
So I'm gonna wait for him to lift his more like Yes,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.470
very good.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.900
Once your dog has gotten the idea.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.620
You can also start to wait back.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.050
This so it looks more like you're saying hello or goodbye.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.880
Yes,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.050
Good boy.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.930
Ultimately,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.050
you want to be able to hold your hand pretty high up.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.150
Your dog is still waving at you.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.250
And the final step of this trick is to add a verbal cue.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.300
What you say Wave.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.080
Hello.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.950
Say goodbye.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.530
Whatever you prefer.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.150
I say we've But why?

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.250
And eventually you should have a wave that looks something like that.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.180
Yes,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.780
but boy,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.470
thank you all for watching this video.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.950
Hope to see you again in the next one.
