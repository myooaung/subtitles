00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060
Hi,

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.750
everyone.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.120
Welcome back to the Ohana dog.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.810
Online training course I'm here again.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.170
Today was stoked the border collie,

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.550
and we're gonna be showing you how to teach dog how to crawl.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.450
So this is another trick that you teach with luring.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.950
I'm gonna start with the treat right next to Stokes knows Here.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.850
I'm just gonna slowly drag it.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.090
Yes,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.580
and so he's crawling for,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.770
like,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.450
a little worm.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:44.550
Wait a second for him and Mark and a good job.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.710
So when you first start out,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.990
you might only be getting,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.550
um,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.400
them to crawl forward a little bit.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.340
That's okay,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.530
though.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.750
You want to build on that?

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.450
So quite a,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.350
uh,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.990
boy,

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.200
that was awesome.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.050
But try again.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.650
I'm gonna reset.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.650
I'm gonna a little more in front of him this time.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.850
And I'm going to take you can go a little bit further this time.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.770
Once again.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.440
It all depends on how quickly your dog is progressing.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.010
If they only want to offer a little bit,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.850
that's okay.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.690
You just want to gradually be making it down.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.320
Cross crawl.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.350
You also want to add that verbal cue wants your dog.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.360
It's about 90% accurate on the behavior.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.220
So once your dog is reliably crawling whenever you're dragging up food,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.690
you can add.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.150
Thank you.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.570
Oh,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.670
boy.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.050
Ready?

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.400
Cross?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.030
Yes.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.610
And you're eventually gonna want toe paid the food lure out.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.950
You don't want to be dragging a treat in front of their face forever.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.850
No.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.870
Crawl?

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.980
Yes.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.470
Good.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.950
And eventually you can even save your sand Blew out.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.950
Ideally,

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.650
you want to be able to stare,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:26.050
Ask your eventually be able to stand from a distance like him.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.060
Hey,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.450
stay.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.650
Give him a very subtle cue.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.160
So for cross?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.320
Yeah.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.390
Good boy.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.550
That was excellent.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.250
All right,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.670
everyone.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.390
I hope this video is useful.
