1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:03,514
So what have we learned during this module?

2
00:00:03,514 --> 00:00:05,954
The first is that Spring Data is not a particular project,

3
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:09,789
but is instead a collection of data access modules.

4
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:12,370
Each of these modules implement Spring Data Commons,

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,825
which provides the core abstractions for data access with Spring Data.

6
00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:19,134
It's a framework that heavily reduces boilerplate,

7
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:21,774
helping you deliver features faster.

8
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:24,638
There's also a gentle learning curve for each Spring Data module,

9
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:27,050
meaning you can get up and running quickly.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,830
And the focus of this course will be Spring Data Commons to

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,898
help us build the foundation we need before working with a

12
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:35,176
specific Spring Data module.

13
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:36,072
In the next module,

14
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:42,000
we'll learn about querying with Spring Data by making use of the Spring Data repository interface.
