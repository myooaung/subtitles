1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,267
And that covers it for this module.

2
00:00:03,267 --> 00:00:06,582
We've learned about how common it is to want to be able to use transactions

3
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:11,377
with Spring Data as we often need ACID guarantees on performing a series of

4
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:14,677
related queries as part of a business operation.

5
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:17,875
Transactions introduce a lot of boilerplate to our code base,

6
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,324
making our code verbose and slowing down the time it

7
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:22,277
takes for us to write a feature.

8
00:00:22,277 --> 00:00:25,186
Spring provides the @Transactional annotation,

9
00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:30,000
a declarative alternative, which lets us achieve transactions without this boilerplate.
