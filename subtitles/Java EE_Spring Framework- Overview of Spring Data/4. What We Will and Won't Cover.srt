00:00:01,304 --> 00:00:03,743
Okay, before we get started with our first demo,

2
00:00:03,743 --> 00:00:07,423
let's go through what this course will and won't be focusing on.

3
00:00:07,423 --> 00:00:10,986
We need to do this simply because the scope of Spring Data is so broad,

4
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:14,871
and we'll only be taking a high-level slice throughout the framework.

5
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:17,277
The main focus will be Spring Data Commons.

6
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:20,199
This parent project is used throughout all of Spring Data,

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,581
and understanding it is key to being able to use any of the other modules.

8
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:27,987
The core interface we'll be working with is a repository interface,

9
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:30,722
providing an abstraction for writing and querying data.

10
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:33,607
As we can't use Spring Data Commons independently,

11
00:00:33,607 --> 00:00:37,311
we'll be using the JPA and MongoDB modules.

12
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:39,498
This, however, is just for demonstrating Commons,

13
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:44,194
and we're not going to touch on the details of either of these implementations.

14
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:46,963
Finally, we're looking at transactions in Spring.

15
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,403
Whilst not technically part of Spring Data,

16
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:51,757
Spring transaction management is extremely powerful

17
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:54,554
and directly related to data access.

18
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,597
This thin slice through Spring Data will also touch on other concepts.

19
00:00:58,597 --> 00:01:02,566
So let's list which of them we'll not be focusing on during the course.

20
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:05,863
The first is Hibernate, JPA, or any other ORM.

21
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:08,746
It's assumed that you already have some knowledge of object

22
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:11,187
relational mapping before starting the course.

23
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:14,505
This only needs to be the basics though as Spring Data Commons does a

24
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:18,345
really good job of abstracting away most of the complexity.

25
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:21,439
We'll also be using Core Spring and Spring Boot during this course,

26
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,735
and it's expected you already know the basics of these.

27
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:27,240
Again, if you don't, you'll still be able to get by,

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,867
but it might be worth covering them in another Pluralsight course.

29
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:35,204
Finally, it's worth mentioning that Spring Data is not for batch processing.

30
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:37,959
Spring Data Batch is a framework independent of Spring

31
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:45,000
Data specifically for that purpose. So if you want to do batch processing, please don't use Spring Data.
