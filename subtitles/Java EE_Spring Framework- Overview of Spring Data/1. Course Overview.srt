Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:11,825
My name's Andrew Morgan, and welcome to my course, Overview of Spring Data.

3
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:15,302
I'm an independent consultant specializing in Spring,

4
00:00:15,302 --> 00:00:17,606
microservices, and continuous delivery.

5
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:21,491
Nearly all Java developers will need to deal with data access at some point,

6
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:25,048
and a lot of the time this involves writing a ton of boilerplate.

7
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:28,012
In this course, we're going to give an overview of Spring Data,

8
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:31,590
a collection of projects for data access in Java.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,235
Some of the major topics that we'll cover include bootstrapping

10
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:37,416
an application with the Spring Data starter,

11
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:41,684
accessing data with repositories, and transaction management with Spring.

12
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:42,647
By the end of this course,

13
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:45,386
you'll know the basics of Spring Data and will be able to

14
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:48,053
get started with any Spring Data project.

15
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:51,147
Before beginning this course, you should be familiar with Spring,

16
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:52,125
Java, and databases.

17
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:52,828
From here,

18
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:58,030
you should feel comfortable diving into any module-specific Spring Data course.

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:08,000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn Spring Data with the Overview of Spring Data course at Pluralsight.
