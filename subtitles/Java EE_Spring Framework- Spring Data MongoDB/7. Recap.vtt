00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.290
[Autogenerated] we came a long way.

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.640
Since starting these module 20 minutes ago,

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.970
we re kept some fundamental mongo technology.

4
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.310
You now know that a Mongol database contains collections those collections

5
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.300
contain documents and documents have feels some pretty different

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.530
terminology than traditional relational databases.

7
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.670
Then we looked at the free steps needed to get started with spring and mongo.

8
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.250
To be.

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.880
The 1st 1 is to configure dependencies if you start

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.480
with an indiscriminate application,

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.440
and the only dependency that you need is the spring

12
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.850
boots starter data mongo to be,

13
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.940
which is an umbrella dependency containing

14
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.080
everything you need to work with Mongo.

15
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.350
Then we looked at how to efficiently use annotations on the

16
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.240
objects that you want to persist as a document at i.

17
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.790
D.

18
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.270
At Field or at Indexed are one of the most use

19
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.440
foundations that will use over and over again.

20
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.950
After that would configure the connection properties.

21
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.170
We need at least the several port,

22
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.250
the Server I P address and the date of his name in order to

23
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.440
establish a connection to among the server,

24
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.250
and we can specify those either in the application properties file or

25
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.760
at wrong time as a parameter last but not least,

26
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.380
we have a simple but functional application,

27
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.000
which is amazing considering that you've been doing this for only 20 minutes or so.
