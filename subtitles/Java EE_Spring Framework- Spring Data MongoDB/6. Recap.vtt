00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.250
[Autogenerated] all right.

2
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.400
Time for a recap in his module.

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.670
You learn how to insert,

4
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.010
update and move documents using the Mongo template class.

5
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.200
We looked at single operations and at batch operations as well.

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.230
Then you learn about the difference between safe

7
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.880
and insert the subtle difference.

8
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.350
But save there's a lot of things under the hood.

9
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.940
There are a lot of developers who use seven insert interchangeably,

10
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.510
but I highly recommend that you make things as expected.

11
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.190
It's possible,

12
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.800
and yours insert when you want to quit document and

13
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.640
save when you want to update them.

14
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.080
And last but not least, we looked at how to create custom converters.

15
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.910
Spring makes it very easy for us tow adding custom

16
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.340
time mapping between Java and Mongo.

17
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.990
We have to implement the converter interface, and then we have to create a writ.

18
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.870
Converter are right.

19
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.510
Converter and register are being in any configuration class.

20
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.660
We've been using mongo template a lot,

21
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.570
and Monk a template is just amazing because he has a lot of flexibility.

22
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.420
We can execute complex queries.

23
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.740
We can insert a bit in three documents in various ways,

24
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.160
and we can even manipulate collections.

25
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.000
But great flexibility, usually comes at a price.

26
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.710
And for Mogo template, that price is type safety.

27
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.330
I bet you noticed that when we are defining our queries,

28
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.720
the name of the fields are plain old strings,

29
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.320
and that's very, very error prone.

30
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.680
Luckily for us, there is a better way,

31
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.000
too right most of our queries using mongo repositories and with that report stories in the next module.
