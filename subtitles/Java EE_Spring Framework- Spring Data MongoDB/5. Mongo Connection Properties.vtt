00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.930
[Autogenerated] connection properties are the last piece of the puzzle on our

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.710
journey to connect a spring application to a mongo server.

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.620
There are a couple of important Mongol parameters that you need to know.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.840
In order to connect to a Mongol to be sever the Mongol server I p.

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.990
Address the mongoose, a report, the date of his name and credentials.

6
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.110
Now, credentials are optional because when you first install a monk a server,

7
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.840
it will not be secured.

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.060
But we have credentials.

9
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.240
You have to provide them as part of the connection you are I.

10
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.450
But where do we define these connection parameters?

11
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.340
Well,

12
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.240
there are multiple ways one of them is to define them

13
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.840
in the application properties file, and you can see an example.

14
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.860
Here we have host port database, user name and password.

15
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.740
All parameters are prefixed with spring that data dot

16
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.240
among would he be Alternatively, we can use a shorthand version.

17
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.370
We can use the spring that data,

18
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.910
that monk body beat out your eye and combine all of the

19
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.640
information into a single property.

20
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.350
In this case, we have the credentials, the user admin, the password.

21
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.060
We have the server I P address local host.

22
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.240
We have the port and we also have the database name.

23
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.990
But we can also specify this connection.

24
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.260
You are I at runtime,

25
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.610
and we can do that by executing our program and then

26
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.690
passing in the exact same parameter.

27
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.520
So we have Java jar, the name over application and then dash dash,

28
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.400
spring data manga, Deb,

29
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.730
your eye and the value that you want to provide the wrong time

30
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.000
parameters will override the parameters defined, the application, properties foul.
