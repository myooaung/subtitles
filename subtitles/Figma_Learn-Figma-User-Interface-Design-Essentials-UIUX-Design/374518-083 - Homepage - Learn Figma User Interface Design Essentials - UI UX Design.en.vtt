00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
Hello,

00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.840
everyone,

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.890
Welcome back to another video of thes scores in these video.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.490
We're going to design our home page together.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.620
So without further ado,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.450
let's get asserted by duplicating this profile completed art board like this,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.390
then I'm going to remove almost everything except the bank ground.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.500
So let's trying to remove all these elements this left arrow as well,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.350
because I don't need that anymore.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.480
And also this home indicator.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.670
Then let's use this rectangle four layer,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.870
which is our bang ground,

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:38.010
and I'm going to change the high to 278 like this.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.890
And after that,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.500
I'm going to double click on that.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.980
Now I mean edit mode.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.150
Then let's select Thies to bottom notes.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.920
So I'm going to choose the 1st 1 and whole shift and choose the 2nd 1 and that set the

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.860
corner radius to 66 like this done,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.650
and make sure to use corner smoothing to get smokes.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.420
Corners like this.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.440
Fantastic.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.450
The next thing we need is the hamburger menu icon right at the top.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.830
So let's go ahead and place an image from the icons.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.120
You can choose hamburger menu.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.090
Place it here are right now.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.650
Let's check.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.110
The pad ings are right.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.770
So now let's set the top heading to 27 like this and the left padding is going to be 30.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.770
Fantastic.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.850
And then I need these pro fine image to put right at the top of thes header.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.080
So let's go ahead and copy and paste it here like this.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.160
Then I'm going to scale it down.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.000
So let's use the scale to So let's get it down to 50 by 50 like this.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.200
I want to set it to 50 by 50 like this.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.560
That's put it right over there.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.810
And then I need to add a status indicator to these profile image to indicate whether this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.630
user is online or not.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.270
So let's add a circle like this.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:10.460
I'm going to city to 10 by 10 and it changed the color to 20 c 968 like this,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.530
and I need a stroke.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.950
So let's add a stroke and change the color to White Fantastic.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.980
And after that I'm going to align it to the right side on Let's move it up a little bit

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.160
like this.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.060
So as you can see,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.180
this indicator is align perfectly with the edges off this profile image.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.660
Okay,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.650
then that's put these circle inside this profile image group,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.750
and that's all.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.730
And after that,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.920
we need to shake the pad ing's the top hiding is going to be 24 picks cells like this on

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.320
the right.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.200
Padding should be 30.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.840
Okay,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.820
Pretty good.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.310
The next thing we need is a text.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.910
Okay,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.700
so let's add a text layer and right.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.950
Good morning,

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.760
Emma.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.540
And then I'm going to change the fund to Monserrat like this.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.960
Make it regular.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.130
And the fun size should be 24 points.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.930
And the color,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.620
obviously white.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.040
All right,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.640
Now let's check the pad ings.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.390
The left heading should be 60.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.070
Pick cells like this and the top heading should be 80.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.500
Fantastic.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.970
Now,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.160
what do we need here?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.640
I'm gonna place a card.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.370
Okay.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.980
Which consists of a bar chart that shows the available balance off this specific user.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.540
So I need to add a rectangle like this for now.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.460
Let's set the with and high to 315 like this,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.610
aligning to the center and increase the corner radius to 40.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.930
And also make sure that you have smooth corners like this,

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.650
then I'm going to change the color to White.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.590
Fantastic.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.170
All right,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.400
Now let's add a drop shadow to this,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.730
so I'm gonna add effects and let's change the settings So the Blair is going to be 50.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.950
The X is going to be zero and of why should be nine in this case,

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.120
let's decrease the capacity to 10% pretty good.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.140
And I'm gonna set the top heading of these car to 16 peak cells like this.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.620
So far,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.170
so good.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.090
Then we need the text that you're here.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.300
So I'm going to write your total balance pretty good.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.520
Let me decrease the fund size to 16 points like this and it stop heading,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.120
is going to be 30 to pick,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.620
sells the left padding 32 pixels as well duplicated.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.740
And now I'm going to change the way too bold and the fun size to 30 points.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.950
And here let's write the amount.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.960
For instance,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.600
that's right.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.970
$8500 like this,

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.110
and I'm going to change the color to two D 99 double F like this.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.940
It stop adding,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.710
is going to be eight peak cells like now and the next thing we need is a more icon.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.260
Okay,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.090
so let's go ahead and place an image.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.820
And here we have the more icon.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.590
I'm gonna place it here.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.980
And as we can see now,

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.960
it's invisible.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.280
As I mentioned before,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.240
it's a bug.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.990
So in order to fix this,

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.150
you can easily close your file and open it once again like this.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.330
And now it's visible.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.800
Okay,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.430
so let's use this icon.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.590
I'm gonna move it to the right side are right now let's align it with our text.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.000
So let's choose thesis more icon.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.350
And this takes layer Anglican align vertically pretty good.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.640
The right padding is going to be 32 peaks cells as well.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.430
However,

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.250
remember to change the color off this text layer,

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.300
so I'm gonna set you 23 a three a and three a pretty good.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.530
And now it's time to create our bar chart together.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.350
So first of all,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.260
we need a rectangle okay to create our bars.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:06.150
I'm going to drag and drop like this and let's set there with two nine and the high to 122

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.860
like this,

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.700
I'm going to double click on that and at select thes two top knowns because I'm going to

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.810
increase the corner radius off them.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.600
Like it a completely around it bar like this.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.040
Then that's choose this.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.260
I'm going to choose the I drop her and choose the same blue as our amount Text like this,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.450
I'm gonna move it down a little bit,

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.520
then duplicated movie to the right side.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.490
I'm going to decrease its height like this.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.280
Let's set it to 30 to pick.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.750
Sells pretty good.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.400
And then I'm going to right click on that.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.910
And let's choose Felipe Vertical.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.710
Okay.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.530
And as you can see,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.250
it's Felipe.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.750
Okay,

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.150
I'm gonna move it down on Let's check the pad ings.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.200
The left padding should be four pixels like this,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.310
and the last thing we need to do is changing the color.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:01.380
So I'm going to set it to a five f three and of the Leff pretty good.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.880
And let's group them.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:10.540
I'm gonna call it column one duplicated and let's set the left padding to 16 pick cells

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.520
like this.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.150
And now I'm going to change the height of these bars.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.780
So let's elect this bar.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.440
Okay?

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:22.310
I'm gonna set it to 100 like this and now it's time to decrease the height of peace bar as

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.850
well.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.850
So let's set it to 23 pretty good.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.410
Then that's duplicated.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.480
Once again.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.900
Place it with the 16 peaks of left patting.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.670
I'm going to decrease the height to 89 like this,

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:37.810
and for this one,

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.250
let's decrease it to 15.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.130
Pretty good.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.550
That's duplicated once again.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:50.990
So let's set the high to 61 and let's decrease the height size of this smaller one as well

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.720
to seven.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.110
Then let's duplicate it once again.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.970
And this time we need to change the place of these two bars.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.460
Okay,

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.460
so first of all,

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.110
let's right.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.820
Click and choose Flip Vertical and I'm gonna move it down like this.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.850
And after that,

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.370
let's decrease its high to 44 pretty good,

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.420
and choose this one as well.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.150
Click and free vertical move it up,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:20.740
and now let's increase its high to 27 like this.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.060
Let's duplicate it,

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.520
and I'm going to decrease this 1 to 15 like this,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.830
and let's increase the 2nd 1 to 70 and finally the last one.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.870
We're going to duplicate it and decrease this bar a little bit,

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:43.210
so I'm gonna set it to 10 and increase the next one to 108 like this.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.150
Now let's select all of them,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.700
group them,

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:53.590
and I'm going to call it columns like this and let's align it with my card.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.020
So I'm going to select this rectangle.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.400
Let's hold shift and click on that.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:04.250
Align into the center and let's set the top heading to 26 like this,

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:10.910
and the bottom padding is going to be 32 because the top adding here is 32 peaks cells.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.110
So we need to increase the height of thes square.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:14.650
Okay,

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.010
as it can see its 26 I'm going to change the height.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:18.640
First,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.460
let's on link these heightened with and then that's right.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.170
Plus six.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.190
Let's check it out.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.960
There we go.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.870
Now we have a 32 picks.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.150
L bottom padding as well are right.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.750
And last but not least,

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.410
we need to group all these elements together.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.350
So let's select all of them,

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.120
grouped them,

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.670
and I'm going to call it balance card.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.110
Fantastic.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.580
All right,

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.500
now let's go ahead and create our tab are okay.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.030
We need to place a tap,

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.420
are right at the bottom of this screen.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.550
So instead of using a pre may tap,

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.990
are I'm going to show you how you can design your customized Taber,

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.350
which is pretty amazing.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.540
So let's go ahead and insert a rectangle here.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.980
I'm going to drag and drop,

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.640
and that changed the Connor toe wind pretty good.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.790
I'm gonna add some drop shadow and let's change the Blair amount to 20 and the why is going

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.900
to be too.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.970
And also we need to decrease the opacity to 10% pretty good.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.200
Then let's decrease the high to 92 as well.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.140
I'm gonna align it to the bottom.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.270
And also we need the home indicator.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:31.440
So let's go ahead and copy and paste it from one of our previous screens like this pretty

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:31.760
good.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.750
And now it's time to create our tamps.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.320
Okay,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.490
so basically,

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.920
we're going to have three different haps.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.790
They wanna tap the notification have and the pro fight tap.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:43.260
OK,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.230
so let's go ahead and place an image.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.850
And in the icons Fuller,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.740
you have a tapper folder as well with three different icons.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.250
So I'm gonna place all of them one by one.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.230
And then let's change their place.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:03.960
So these notification icon is going to be right in the middle and the pro fine should be on

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.840
the right side,

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.810
are right now that's set the padding between them.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:08.960
So first of all,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.470
I'm going to select all of them like this.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.550
And from the alignment section,

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.710
I'm going to click and distribute horizontal spacing like this.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.750
And after that,

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.450
with these indicator,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:25.030
I can easily set the padding between them to 90 pretty good.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:29.790
And then we need a circular indicator to show that he stabs active.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.250
Okay,

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.390
so I'm going to create a circle.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.790
Let's make it five by five and I'm going to shoot me.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.280
I drop her to select the same color as our icon.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.400
Let's align it to the center pretty good.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.650
And it stop hiding is going to be a peak cells.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:46.190
Okay.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.790
Like this.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.160
Now let's group them.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.680
Okay.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.400
This is going to be our wallet.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.240
Really good.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.840
We have notification and profile as well.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.080
Select all of them,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.870
grouped them once again.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.150
I'm gonna call it taps,

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.950
and it's a line into the center like this.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:04.790
It stop adding,

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.960
is going to be 24 picks cells like this Okay,

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.350
now we're almost done.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.140
However,

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.150
I'm going to create some components in order to make your life much,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.930
much easier.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:15.480
Okay,

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.530
so let's select this group wallets and I'm gonna click on create component icon.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:21.290
There we go.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.570
So now we just created a component.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.080
Okay,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.410
then let's copy this,

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.420
and I'm going to create a new page.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.390
Let's call it symbols,

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.050
and I'm gonna paste it here.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:31.900
There we go.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.090
Then.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.350
I need to copy and paste thes two icons as well.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.730
So let's select them,

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:41.710
copied them and paste them in the symbols page right here.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.640
Fantastic.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:42.990
So,

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.550
basically,

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.620
for each icon,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.310
we need to different states,

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.810
the active estate and the active estate.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.240
So this blue one is going to be our active state,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.140
and these dark gray one is going to be our the active state.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.240
So what we're going to do is creating two different states here.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.750
So now I'm going to duplicate it.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.320
Okay,

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.380
let's detach it from its master like this.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.730
Remove the circle and I'm going to change the color to these dark gray.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.160
So let's choose thes eyedropper and select this one.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.530
The color code is three a three a and three a.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.250
So now I'm going to select these wallet frame Anglican,

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.440
create component like this,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.700
and let's change the name to wallet slash the active,

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:34.650
and that's rename me to wallet slash Active.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.080
Pretty good.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.490
Actually,

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.490
As you can see,

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.780
this is an instance off the master component.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.270
Okay,

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.700
so our master component is here,

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.130
so I'm going to cut this,

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:46.760
okay?

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.530
And let's paste it here so that we can have the master component.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.450
I'm going to remove this one,

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.720
and there we go.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.570
Once again,

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.970
that's rename me to wallet Slash active,

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:03.000
and we're going to do the same thing for these two icons as well.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.870
So for notification,

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.490
I'm going to duplicate it.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.080
That's movie to the left side.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.020
Let's change the color to this blue like this.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.750
I need this circle as well,

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.990
so I'm going to copy and paste it here.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:19.450
Make sure that it's totally aligned selectees two layers.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:28.730
Group them and let's write notification slash Active frankly can create component like this

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:36.860
on the 2nd 1 is going to be notification slash the active and for profile as well.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.580
I'm going to duplicate it.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.960
That's change its color to thesis Blue one,

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.980
and I'm going to copy and paste this circle as well.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.750
Group them and it's college profile active,

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.180
click and create component,

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.490
and the last one should be profile.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.520
The active,

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:02.860
like this Anglican create component are right before got to create a component off this the

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.280
active notification.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.780
So let's click and create components for this one as well.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.540
And as you can see,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.010
we have another frame here.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.420
So let's remove that.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.080
We don't need it pretty good.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.340
Now we have six different components.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:16.750
Okay,

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.510
so now how can be used them?

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.380
Let's go back to our page one.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.910
And now we need to replace our icons.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.390
Beat our components.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:24.930
Okay,

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.760
so let's go toe assets.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:32.420
And here we have three different components that's placed the active wallet here pretty

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:32.890
good.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.950
And also I'm going to remove both off them.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.220
So let's place the d active notification as well.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.130
Pretty good.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.560
And also the active profile.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.290
Okay,

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.520
select all of them.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.710
You can distribute resentful spacing the line them vertically as well on let's set the

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.090
padding to 90 like this.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:52.780
Once again,

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:53.980
group them on.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.660
I'm gonna call it tamps.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.080
Let's align this group to the center pretty good.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.520
And now we need to align these two icons to the top off this group.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.090
Okay,

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:08.300
so let's select all of them and click aligned to the top Pretty good.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.540
Now I'm gonna show you why we did that.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.650
So suppose that you're going to make this the active instead of changing our icons again

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.330
and again.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:16.650
Now,

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.270
we can easily go to the incense section.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.210
And from these drop menu,

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:25.600
we can easily choose the active or active are right.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.480
Pretty good.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:26.840
Now,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.500
let's group are elements.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:34.280
So I'm going to select these tabs and also our rectangle and this home indicators grouped

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:34.700
them.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:41.560
And I'm gonna call it Tap Or and the last thing we need to create is another card here.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.050
Okay,

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.530
so let's elect thes balance card.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.280
I'm gonna hold Command key and click on that.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.990
Copy this and paste it here.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:54.360
Let's change the high to 146 like this.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.890
I'm gonna move it down.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.500
And that set the top hiding 2 24 p.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.840
Sal's pretty good.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.610
Then I'm going to choose this button.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.880
I'm gonna hold command key on that.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:09.580
Select this rectangle to And then let's write leak on this rectangle to because I'm gonna

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.140
copy and paste the properties off thes button.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.300
I need that radiant.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.650
So let's click on copy Properties and I'm going to select this card and that's paste it

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:20.910
here pretty good.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:21.490
However,

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.220
remember to change the corner radius as well,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.480
because we pace that the properties off thes bottom.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.400
So we need to change it to 40 once again,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.360
pretty good.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.280
And after that I'm going to select thes circles.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.080
Copy them,

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.500
paste them here like this Pretty good.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:44.350
Let's move these purple one a little bit down and this blue one a little bit up.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:48.190
And now I'm going to duplicate this rectangle like this.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.950
Move it down and now I can easily mask thes circles.

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.480
So let's use rectangle six,

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.280
which is the higher rectangle.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.480
And these circles Anglican mask fantastic.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.040
However,

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.160
remember to remove this drop shadow,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.820
and I think it's a good idea to change the place off these two circles.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:12.440
So I'm gonna move these blue one down and this purple one up to get something like this,

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.960
and that's scale them a little bit now.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.880
It looks great.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.000
Then we need a text layer So that's insert one.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.810
That's right.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:26.710
Check your bank accounts like this,

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.760
and it's increased the font size to 20 points.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.660
I'm gonna make it white.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.320
And also,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.340
let's change the frame off these funds to get something like this.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.020
Okay,

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.870
then I'm gonna align it with my card,

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.090
so we need to choose both off them,

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.490
align it vertically,

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.990
and the left padding should be 32 p cells.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.630
All right,

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.730
we're almost son.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.420
The only thing we need to add is a small right arrow.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.160
So let's place an image.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.300
Let's use small arrow and place it here.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.080
Okay,

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.300
Pretty good on,

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.840
Let's align it vertically.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.800
Fantastic.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.680
And the right padding is going to be 32 as well.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.350
Now it's time to select all our elements.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:14.010
So let's elect this mass group this rectangle seven as well.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:21.250
Thes takes layer and this small arrow group them and let's call it bank accounts card.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.010
And that's all are right,

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:24.370
guys,

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.880
it was a lying video.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.760
However,

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.750
as you can see,

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:32.600
it could create this amazing and modern dashboard for our finance up.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.340
The last thing we need to do is renaming our art poor to home page.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:37.940
All right,

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:38.350
guys,

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.500
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.760
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.070
And I will see you in the next video.
