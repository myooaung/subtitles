00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hi,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.080
everyone in these video,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.590
we're gonna be talking him out via framing.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:11.000
Violent framing is a way to design an APP or website services at the structure or level.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.950
A wire frame is generally used to layout contents and functionalities.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.790
On a page,

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.250
which take user needs and experiences into account,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.920
we can consider wire framing a graphical skeleton similar to the blueprint of a car.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.540
The viral frame determines the details off the whole project at the initial stage as the

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.770
project description,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.220
Most beginners think that wire framing and prototyping are somehow the same.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.250
However they are not.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.310
A wire frame is a low fidelity design,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.000
so it does not illustrate the final appearance off the user interface.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.300
On the other hand,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.400
a prototype is a high fidelity design,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.600
and its dynamic and interactive prototyping looks almost like the final product.
