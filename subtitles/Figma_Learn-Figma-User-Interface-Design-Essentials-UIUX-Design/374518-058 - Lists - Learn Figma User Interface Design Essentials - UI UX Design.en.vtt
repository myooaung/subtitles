00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
Hey,

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.020
everyone,

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.780
in these video we're gonna be talking about lists.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.720
Least are a continuous group of images or texts.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.390
They are composed of items including primary and second reactions,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.990
which are represented by icons on texts.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.750
When you're designing lists,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.150
make sure to pay attention to the following points.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.780
Number one consistency least must present icons,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.040
tax and actions in a consistent format.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.840
Number two action police show content in a way that makes it easy to recognize a specific

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.800
item in the collection and act on it.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.670
And last but not least,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.150
scannable at least should be classified in logical ways that make content easy to scan.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.820
As you can see on the right side of the screen,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.820
we have different kind of lists.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.550
For instance,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.540
here we have your contacts.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.350
As you can see,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.640
it's composed of images and tax,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.440
and also it has an icon
