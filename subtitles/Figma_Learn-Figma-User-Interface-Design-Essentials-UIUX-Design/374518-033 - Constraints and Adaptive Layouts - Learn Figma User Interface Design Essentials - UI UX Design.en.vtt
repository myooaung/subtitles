00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.290
Hi,

00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.910
everyone.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.860
And welcome back to another video of thes course.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.050
In this video,

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.410
we're gonna be talking about constraints and responsive layouts.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.650
So whether constraints and why do we need to make our design responsive?

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.640
So suppose that you're designing a webpage or an application screen and you're using,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.820
for instance,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.970
this art board macro.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.600
Okay,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.430
then what happens when your user uses the portrayed mote like this?

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.990
So if you didn't make your design responsive,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.150
everything would be disorganized.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.640
So in this video,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.060
we're gonna be talking about constraints and how you could make your pages responsive.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.780
First of all,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.800
I'm going to design a simple landing page here.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.000
So let's go ahead and add a rectangle here like this and I'm going to change the color.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.010
Too dark blue.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.400
Pretty awesome.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.640
Then I'm gonna add a text here.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.430
That's right.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.550
Welcome to the world off you I ux design.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.880
Let me change the color toe White for now and I'm going to change the fund to SF pro text.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.070
I'm gonna make it larger a little bit that set it to 64 I think it's better to make it a

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.080
fixed size text layer like this.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.450
Then let me align you to the center and also here.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.250
Pretty good.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.630
Then what else do we need?

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm gonna add some links or menus at the top.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.590
So let's write home.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.060
I'm gonna make it white as well.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.800
Let's make it smaller.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.250
I think 24 points is great.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.510
Duplicate that,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.650
then let's right.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.710
Pricing once again duplicate that and here,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.670
services.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.810
Once again,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.950
I'm going to duplicate that and now contact us pretty good.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.710
That's also first of all,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.130
let's change the spacing between them.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.870
And I'm gonna choose this menu in the Inspector and I'm gonna click.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.830
Distribute horizontal spacing like this.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.000
And in this way,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.690
the spacing between my links or my menus will be equal.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.880
And if you want to check this pacing between your objects,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.960
you can easily select one text or object and then hold option key or aren't on your

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.670
keyboard,

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.290
and you can hover your mouse on top off the text or shape next to your previous shape.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.140
As you can see,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.850
it has been said to 25.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.750
I'm going to make it 24 like this.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.720
Pretty awesome.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.480
And now on,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.350
let's make thes text bold so I'm gonna choose bold.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.090
Now it's better and I'm gonna make it a little bit larger,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.570
pretty good.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.580
And let's group our menus at the top Command G or controlled G.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.480
I'm gonna write menus pretty awesome.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.900
I aligned it vertically as well,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.440
and that's all for now.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.940
So now,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.950
as you can see,

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.720
we have designed this page for my quick pro with this dimension 14 40 by 900.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.080
And it has been designed for landscape mode.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.170
So if I change it to portrayed,

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.400
you can see that everything will be disorganized.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.020
Okay,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.730
so we need to make our page responses to do that.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.320
First,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.780
let's elect these text.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.640
And as you can see in the Inspector,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.230
you have something called constraints.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.910
So we're going to use that.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.680
And as you can see,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.330
the constraints are said to top and left.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.170
But we're going to change it because we need to keep these texts to the center off our

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.750
screen.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.160
Okay,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.250
I'm gonna change it to center.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.110
And let's keep this to top,

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.310
because we need to keep this distance to the top.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.950
The same.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.810
And now,

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.360
if I choose my frame and change it to portrait mode,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.100
we can see that it automatically changes its position,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.720
and now everything is great.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.840
The next thing we need to do is to set constrained for our menus.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.140
So let's go back to landscape mode,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.560
and now I'm going to select the menus.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.680
And as you can see,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.880
the constraints are said to left and top.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.520
However,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.040
they need to say to the center and top,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.910
So I'm going to change it to the center.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.080
And now if I change my frame to the poor freight mood,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.160
you can see that it will change responsibly like this.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.350
It's pretty cool,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.000
isn't it?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.890
However,

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.870
what if I make my screen even larger like this?

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.260
You can see that my background is not responsive.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.350
So now please pause the video and try to fix that issue by yourself.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.530
And then I would show you how you could do that are right,

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.860
Guys,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.450
I'm pretty sure that you could fix that for yourself,

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.230
however,

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.030
Now I'm going to show you as well,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.460
in case that you had difficulties doing that are right.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.130
So in order to make your bank around responsible as well.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.850
First,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.900
let's choose thes rectangle,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.910
which is our bank round And as you can see,

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.200
the constraints are said to the left and top edges.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.240
The only thing we need to change is this one.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.940
So if we can change it to left and right,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.710
everything would be great.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.360
Now,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.360
let's give you the trying now I'm gonna make my frame even larger.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.080
And as you can see,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.470
we have a stretchy background like this.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.750
That was pretty easy.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.230
Are right,

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.580
guys,

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.210
that's all for this video.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.380
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.550
And I will see you in the next video.
