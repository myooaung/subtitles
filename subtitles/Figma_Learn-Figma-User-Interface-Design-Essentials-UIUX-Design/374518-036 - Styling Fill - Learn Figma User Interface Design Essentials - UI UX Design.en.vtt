00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.540
Hi,

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.000
Ron.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.470
I hope you're doing well in this video.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.020
We're gonna be talking about the field section.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.640
So without further ado,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.950
let's get started with inserting a new shape here.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.480
I'm going to create a rectangle.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.810
Let's increase the corner radius like this on your right.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.480
In the inspector section,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.520
you can see the feel section,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.150
Okay.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.010
And here you could choose your desired color for your object or even your text layer pay

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.190
like this.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.200
For instance,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.250
Now we choose red OK,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.460
and thes red color has a value.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.920
The brightness of each color is called its value.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.210
And as you can see,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.140
if we add why to this color it gets lighter.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.520
And if you add black to this color,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.980
it gets darker and darker.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.350
You can also use the eyedropper for choosing your Connor like this.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.220
And you can also choose your color with hex code here.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.050
Okay,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.740
you can set it to RGB CSS hs l and edges be,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.250
but most of the time we use hex code.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.210
Sometimes we need to change the opacity of each color.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.130
In that case,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.290
you could use this slider like this,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.690
and as you can see now,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.360
it gets transparent.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.820
Or you could use this percentage year like 20% Pretty good.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.280
And right at the bottom.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.720
You could see your document colors.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.610
As you can see,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.760
we don't have any document Connors because we haven't created one yet.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.740
However,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.150
in the futures lessons,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.010
we'll talk about it right at the top left.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.720
You could see a drop menu.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.550
Okay.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.590
If I open it,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.180
you can see that you have plenty of options.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.020
The 1st 1 is solid.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.140
And as you can see,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.690
you could only choose a single and base color.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.230
Okay,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.600
If you want to use a great and you could choose linear like these and for instance,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.940
I can choose the second color here.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.690
However,

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.630
it said to transparent I can increase the capacity to 100%.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.440
And with these controllers,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.550
you can change the direction of your radiant like this.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.240
You could even add more colors to your grade.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.650
Ian's.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.960
If you click here like this,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.370
I can choose this color as well.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.480
Pretty awesome.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.800
The other option that you have is radial gray didn't Okay,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.600
you have also angular like this.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.350
And then we have diamond like this.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.030
An image that I already talked about.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.770
However,

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.700
the two most important options are solid and linear.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.530
Okay,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.130
You could also change the opacity off your color or radiant here like this.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.900
And you can hide it if you want or remove it.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.370
And here you can change your color mode from normal to color.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.370
Saturation,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.150
hue difference.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.640
We will talk about these options later.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.630
However,

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.250
if you want to see what's gonna happen if you change it,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.450
we need another object.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:13.580
So I'm gonna create any rectangle like this and let's set its color to something like these

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.060
Flu.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.520
And I'm going to change the color mode to color like this.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.210
You can see the difference here.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.680
I can set it to overlay like this screen.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.210
Etcetera are right,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.600
guys.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.360
That's all for this video.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.250
Thank you so much for watching it.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.540
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.550
And I receive in the next video
