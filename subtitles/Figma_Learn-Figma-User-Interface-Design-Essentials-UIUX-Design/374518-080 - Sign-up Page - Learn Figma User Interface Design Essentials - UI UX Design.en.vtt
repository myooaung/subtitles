00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.330
Hi,

00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.970
everyone,

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.210
and welcome back to another weedy off these course in this video,

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.720
we're going to continue designing our signing pages and also our sign of pages together.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.760
So without for I do,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.150
let's go ahead and duplicate this sign page.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.980
I'm going to select this art board and let's duplicate it.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.790
And after that,

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:29.640
I'm gonna go ahead and rename this art board to signing Dash Password because in these

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.410
aren't board,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.820
we're going to make this password risible.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.390
Okay,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.890
so let's zoom in a little bit.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.890
Fantastic.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.060
I'm going to select this text layer and let's right you I 2020 pretty good.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.290
And obviously we need to change thes icon as well.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.750
All right,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.260
so let's go ahead and insert a new icon from our assets file.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.850
I'm gonna goto icons and here we have I hidden.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.320
So let's like that and place it here,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.760
and I'm going to replace it with our previous icon like this.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.290
I'm going to remove this,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.610
and that's put these eye icon inside our past four text field.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.150
Fantastic are right.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.780
That's all for these art board that Mrs Welter a little bit,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.610
and after that,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.770
we're going to create our sign of page.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.170
Okay,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.050
it's going to be almost the same.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.510
So the only thing we need to change is this title.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.730
So I'm gonna go ahead and select thes signing page,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.240
okay,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.350
then duplicated.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.080
And I'm going to rename me to sign up pretty good.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.750
And let's change these title to sign up as well and remember to change your bottom as well

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.750
.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.460
So I'm going to select thes takes layer and it's going to be sign up fantastic.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.510
And there we go.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.800
We just created our sign.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.720
A page are right Now let's duplicate the sign up page once again,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.600
and this time we're going to create another state of these texts.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.810
Well,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.310
okay,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.080
for instance,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.260
we're going to design an error state.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.750
Okay,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.660
so let me zoom in a little bit.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.490
And first,

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.440
let's rename this art poor to sign up wrong email like this.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.550
Then let's make these emails running,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.750
for example.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.210
I'm going to remove these dot com like this,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.230
so as you can see,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.120
it's not a complete email address,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.150
and then we need to remove these tick icon as well.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.550
When it's incorrect.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.410
It doesn't make sense to have this tick icon So we need to remove that and let me move the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.580
whole text field and little bit up in order to have more room for adding the error,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.100
OK,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.750
at the bottom.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.790
So the first thing we need to do is changing the color off this title to a red color.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.370
Okay,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.830
so I want to change the Kanako to f D 27 27 and let me copy this color code because I'm

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.900
gonna need that,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.650
then that selectees or resentful line and change the color to the same red.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.350
Okay.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.360
And after that,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.410
I'm gonna go ahead and duplicate thes text layer movie down like here,

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.390
and that's right.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.760
The email address is incomplete like this.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.580
However,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.180
I'm going to change the font size to 13 points pretty good.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.900
And let's change the color to these red as well.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.850
And then I'm going to change the weight from regular to light.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.870
Fantastic.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.890
And now it's time to check our patterns.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.100
So,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.480
as you can see now,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.450
our top adding is set to nine peak cells.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.280
I'm gonna make it eight like this.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.140
Then let's move these texts into our email address group here pretty good.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.540
And its bottom padding is going to be 24 pixels like this and for sure.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.560
We need to move these sign up title a little bit.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.910
So I'm going to move it up to get a 42 p sell bottom padding like this Pretty good.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.130
And now everything looks great.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.950
Are right now we need one more sign a page.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:01.510
Okay,

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.050
so let's go ahead and select the sign up page this one,

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.540
and I'm going to duplicate it.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.820
And thats rename me to sign up typing,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.470
okay,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.890
because we're going to present the keyboard here on Earth to show the developer how these

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.800
layouts works when we present a keyboard.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.300
Okay,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.190
because obviously,

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.250
we're going to move some elements here,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.450
so I'm going to zoom Mean,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.480
are right.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.030
And the first thing we need to do is to select these elements,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.640
okay,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.860
and move them up like this.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.330
And then let's go ahead and place on image and from the Assets folder Apple.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.860
I use you.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.910
I You have key wars,

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.100
and let's select that place it here pretty good.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.110
Fantastic.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.080
And then I'm gonna go ahead and select this email address,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:55.060
takes field and pass for takes field group them and move them up till you get a 24 peaks on

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.000
top heading like this.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.600
Okay,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.380
are right.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.630
Everything is good.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.440
However,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.330
we need to add one more thing.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.820
A text input marker.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.320
Okay,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.290
Because the user is typing in these page.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.660
We need to add a text input marketer here.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.590
So it's so easy to create one.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.090
Let's go ahead and create a line like this,

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.000
however thes time a vertical line.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.880
And I'm gonna set the with 2 19 like thes.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.350
And I'm going to change the color to these purple like Arctic icon.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.450
Fantastic.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.310
It's bottom padding is going to be a pixels.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.070
Pretty good.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.950
Now let's move this line inside these password group,

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.530
Okay?

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.350
That you can measure all the padding is correctly,

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.100
as you can see now are left.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.760
Padding is said to four.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.510
Let's make it too.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.080
And I'm gonna move it down a little bit to get a visual balance.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.610
Okay?

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.550
Pretty good.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.230
And everything is great.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.750
Are right,

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.010
Guys,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.570
we have successfully created all our signing pages and also our sign up pages together.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.390
That's all for this video.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.560
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.210
And in the next video we will start designing our OTP verification pages.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.300
So see you.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.650
