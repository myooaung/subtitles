00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.005
Hi there.

00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:04.200
In this video we're going to set up our project and

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.620
then we will start designing our landing page together.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.680
So first of all, open up fema and I am going to click on

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.180
this plus icon at the top right corner to create a new file.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.685
Okay, if you don't see these two icons,

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.550
that's because you are in a draft section.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.470
Okay, and that's totally fine.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.985
There is no difference here because right now I am on a design course team.

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:30.525
So this is why I have these two additional icons.

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:34.530
But if you are under draft section or the recent section,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.455
just need to click on this plus icon to create a new file.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:41.375
So let's click on that. There we go.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.045
I'm gonna name it landing page.

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:45.110
Pretty good.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.345
So what do we need for this project?

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:50.330
So first of all, you're going to create our design guide.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.820
It's going to include our topographies,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.430
tiles, and our colors styles.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.910
Okay?

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.140
Alright, so I'm going to press a key on my keyboard to create an art board.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.990
Okay, so when I press a key on my keyboard,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.670
this frame two will be selected and I'm gonna click and drag like this to create a frame.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.085
I'm going to make it larger a little bit.

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:17.195
And now I'm going to change the feel to F2,

00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:22.879
F6, and WWF to get this very light blue as our background.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:27.140
Okay, then I'm going to name it designed, I predicted.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.605
So this Design Guide is going to have two different sections, typography and colors.

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:37.565
So I'm going to select the Rectangle tool at the top

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:41.795
and click and drag to create a rectangle like this.

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:46.940
Alright, I'm gonna make it white like this and let me make it rounded.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.065
Okay, so I'm going to increase the corner radius to 30.

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:51.950
Fantastic.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.605
Now let's add some drop shadow to it.

00:01:54.605 --> 00:01:56.660
So let's add an effect to it.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.410
There we go. By default it's set to drop shadow.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.410
And I'm going to change its settings a little bit.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.505
Alright, first of all,

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:10.565
I'm gonna change the color to 1-6, 19, and 4F.

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:11.465
Fantastic.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:17.060
Then I'm gonna set the blurry amount to 100 and the y to 50.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.960
Pretty good.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.275
And finally, let me decrease the capacity from 25% to 10%.

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:25.925
It looks amazing, isn't it?

00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:29.690
Now, let me tell you why I chose these amounts.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.260
Okay.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.620
If you're not sure how to set these amounts, for example,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.045
the blurred of y,

00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:38.540
you can always use the formula that I use, okay?

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.685
And it works almost all the time.

00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:41.765
And it's so simple,

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:45.185
you just need to take the Blair amount and divide it by two.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:53.600
So for example, here I used 100 and here I can even write 100 slash to divide it by two.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.905
And in this case,

00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:58.160
you will get a very good and soft drop shadow.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.185
And this is exactly what I wanted.

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:03.005
All right, so let me make it bigger a little bit.

00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:05.090
And then I'm going to select the Text tool.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.960
So I'm going to press a key on my keyboard and click here and let me

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.610
decrease the size a little bit for noun to, for example, 36.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.005
And here I'm gonna write topography predicted for these projects.

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:19.805
I'm going to use a Google font,

00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:22.115
which is called rubato, okay?

00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:24.785
And it's available by default in sigma,

00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:26.435
so you don't need to install it.

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:30.620
So let me change the weight from bowl to medium.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.605
And also I am going to decrease the font size from 36 to 24 points like this.

00:03:36.605 --> 00:03:38.570
Now, I'm gonna duplicate it,

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.345
Command Z or Control D on your keyboard,

00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:42.815
and we're gonna move it down.

00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:44.015
Let me zoom in.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.335
If you want to zoom in,

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:48.830
you can hold down the Command or Control key,

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.120
and at the same time,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.150
you can use the wheel on your mouse.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.165
Okay, so here we're gonna write heading H 160 bald,

00:03:59.165 --> 00:04:03.005
okay, and I'm gonna select that and let's make it bold.

00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:05.614
And for these Heading, one,

00:04:05.614 --> 00:04:09.080
I am going to choose the font size 60.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.885
Okay, let me write 60 here.

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:12.785
Pretty good.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:17.510
Going to zoom out a little bit and make sure to change the line height, okay,

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.780
the line height here by default is set to auto,

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.085
but make sure to write 150%, okay?

00:04:25.085 --> 00:04:28.160
You may not see any changes here right now,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.680
but let me show you an example.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.475
So I am going to add a takes the year and let's write something.

00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:36.500
Hello world.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.315
We are creating our design guide,

00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:43.835
and I'm gonna make it smaller.

00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:45.320
So as you can see here,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.870
we have three lines. Am I correct?

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.954
I set it to auto.

00:04:49.954 --> 00:04:52.430
The line height now is set to 70.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.570
If you click on this,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.670
you may see the default number,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.740
and now it seems okay.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.675
But if I change it to regular,

00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:02.090
and if I decrease this font size to,

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.865
for example, 30 points, okay?

00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:08.345
And now you can see that these takes line is not that readable.

00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:12.425
But if I change these line-height from 35,

00:05:12.425 --> 00:05:16.445
which is Auto to 150%,

00:05:16.445 --> 00:05:18.275
you can see that it's more readable,

00:05:18.275 --> 00:05:20.465
especially for line paragraphs.

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:23.795
So crucial to have enough space between your lines.

00:05:23.795 --> 00:05:27.665
Ok, so this is the reason that we use 150%.

00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:28.895
So what does it mean?

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:30.095
If I remove that?

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:37.880
It means that I multiply the font size 30 by 1.5 and I get 45.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.690
So when I set it to 150%,

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.500
it means that my line height now is 45. Arrive.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.995
So now we need to create our textile.

00:05:48.995 --> 00:05:50.510
Okay, how can I do that?

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.660
It's so simple. I'm going to select this takes layer,

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.660
and I'm going to click on these four dots icon.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.190
Okay, there we go.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.355
Click on this plus icon create style.

00:06:01.355 --> 00:06:05.780
And here let me write heading slash H1.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.560
Ok, but why did I use a slash between these two wards?

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.690
When I want to create a category for my textiles or my color signs,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.670
I can use slash in between them.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:23.944
Okay, so I will put this H1 under the heading category and we're going to create a style.

00:06:23.944 --> 00:06:24.845
And there we go.

00:06:24.845 --> 00:06:28.715
Here we can see that the name of this category is heading,

00:06:28.715 --> 00:06:31.265
and under this heading I have H one.

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:34.055
And whenever you want to modify these textile,

00:06:34.055 --> 00:06:36.155
you can easily click on this icon,

00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:39.065
edit style, and edit your text style.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.780
You can even add a description here.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.400
You can modify the name,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.980
modify the properties, et cetera.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.670
Pretty good.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:52.805
Now I'm going to enlarge this rectangle a little bit to get more space to work with.

00:06:52.805 --> 00:06:56.179
And then I'm gonna duplicate it moving down.

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:59.150
And here we are going to create our second textile.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.455
But before doing that,

00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:05.255
we need to make sure that we detach these texts layer from its style.

00:07:05.255 --> 00:07:07.655
If I head over to this section,

00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:11.750
you can see that we have an icon called detach style.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.040
I'm going to click on that.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.665
And now these texts layer is no longer connected to the style that we just created.

00:07:18.665 --> 00:07:25.085
So let me change this H1 to H2 and it's going to be 50.

00:07:25.085 --> 00:07:28.130
So I went to decrease the font size 250 points.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:28.910
And that's all.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.295
Don't forget to create your Textile,

00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:34.445
gonna write heading H2.

00:07:34.445 --> 00:07:35.210
Pretty good.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.849
Again, let me duplicated Moby down,

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:39.695
detach it from its style.

00:07:39.695 --> 00:07:41.855
Let me change it to age three,

00:07:41.855 --> 00:07:45.090
and I'm gonna make it 40.
