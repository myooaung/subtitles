00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
Hey,

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.720
everyone in these video,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.030
we're going to be talking about tables.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.470
Tables are containers that show users different records,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.150
such as products,

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.180
prices,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.190
status dates,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.750
etcetera a day.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.390
The table contains ahead a row at the top,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.520
at least Colin names,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.290
followed by rules for later.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.290
They're usually scroll herbal and easy to scare.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.810
So if you need to populate some data,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.230
which are sore doble and follow the same pattern,

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.410
you can use tables when you're designing tables.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.190
Make sure to pay attention to the following things.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.030
Number one expandable rows in the table can be expandable in order to allow the user to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.290
evaluate additional information without losing its context.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.690
Number two pagination pagination works by presenting a set of numbers,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.960
interview with the ability to navigate to another set and,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.820
lastly,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.050
fix headers.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.620
Fixing the row header while a user scrolls through a table helps the user to know about the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.390
column name
