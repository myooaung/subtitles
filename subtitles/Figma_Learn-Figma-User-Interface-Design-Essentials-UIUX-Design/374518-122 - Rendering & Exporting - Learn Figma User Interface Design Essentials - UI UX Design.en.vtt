00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.380
Hello,

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:00.750
Ron.

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.830
And welcome back to another video of thes section in these video.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.470
We're going to talk him out,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.330
rendering You're seen as I mentioned before.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.650
Whenever you're working on a three d project,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.370
you need to render it in the end.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.280
All right,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.310
so now I'm gonna show you how you can modify the rendering settings and also how you can

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.560
use the viewer option and also how you can export.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.170
You're fine.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.060
So before doing that,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.770
I'm going to do some adjustments to our shadow plane.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.900
Let's go and select our shadow plane,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.410
and I'm going to change its color to something like this.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.690
I'm going to choose the color picker.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.190
All right,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.230
now let's render are seen.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.050
It's great,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.770
isn't it?

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.220
All right,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.630
for rendering your scene,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.040
you have different options.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.780
First of all,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.390
let's go ahead and open up the render menu right at the top.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.110
The first section is like thes toggle.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.750
Okay,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.050
so you can modify the quality.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.440
You can set it too low,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.780
medium or high,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.300
and it can kill.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.960
You can start friend or preview like this.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.150
You can add some effects through it.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.830
We can change the situation.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.690
The contrast the color filter and also color balance,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.710
etcetera.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.450
And last but not least,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.400
you can export.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.930
You're seen as an image.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.730
However,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.490
you need to upgrade your license in order to get that functionality,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.560
and then you can click on down with image.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.670
The next important feature of victory is viewer.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.320
Okay,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.840
so when you go to viewer section,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.170
you have different options here that you can modify like textures baking.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.150
And these are about lightings.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.700
And here you can choose center camera view,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.150
and it means that the camera view will be centered on currently selected object.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.780
Okay,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.910
so if you select you eye,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:54.080
the camera view will be centered on this object and the augmented reality is on,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.840
which is great because we can get an augmented reality seen as well.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.430
Then we generate our court here and now we can click and generate.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.820
It takes some time,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.350
and it's done all right.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.730
And here you can get the coat.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.550
As it can see,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.450
you can copy and paste the I frame code.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.010
You're a shame and code,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.970
or if you're not developing your website or the application can easily give it to your

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.690
developer and he or she could use that perfectly.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.540
However,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.030
if you want to display to your clients in advance,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.560
you can change the format from a shame Ally frame to link,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.290
and you can copy this link to your clipboard and send it to your clients or your friend.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.420
So first of all,

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.750
let's check it out here.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.940
There we go.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.860
It's gonna look like this.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.910
Isn't it great?

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.050
We can hold command and so mean.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.740
That's fantastic,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.420
isn't it?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.700
And if you open up this scene on your phone,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.600
we can use theater,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.900
commented reality option in orderto like meant this scene in your environment,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.410
that's pretty awesome,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.350
so make sure to check it out.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.650
You can use both Android and RUS devices to do that,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.000
and that's fantastic.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.090
The next option is export,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.190
and here you can export your file with any format you want.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.730
O B g d a ust Z,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.550
which is augmented reality format for Rus etcetera.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.200
However,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.970
in order to use these kind of functionality,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.760
you have to get an extended license for that.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.360
Alright,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.820
