00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.470
Hey,

00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.270
everyone in these video,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.260
we're going to talk about sliders in design.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.500
Sliders allow users to make selections from a range of values.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.040
They are ideal for adjusting settings such as brightness,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.070
volume,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.950
etcetera.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.220
Sliders can have icons on both sides of the bar.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.220
When you're designing a cider,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.840
make sure to pay attention to the following things.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.640
Number one states design all states off the Steiger,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.140
such as enable disable,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.950
tapped,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.890
hover,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.770
etcetera,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.340
just like buttons.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.250
Number two.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.740
Adjusting sliders should only be used for choosing selections from a range of values.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.090
Number four quickness.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.580
Sliders should react immediately,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.450
so changes must be instantaneous.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.240
And last but not least,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.260
accessibility Sliders should provide the whole range of choices available to the user to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.150
select from.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.680
If you look at the picture on the right side,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.130
you can see that we have two different sliders.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.020
The 1st 1 is continuous slider,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.020
and as you can see in thes kind of Snyder,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.070
you can modify it continuously and without any interruption.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.340
On the other hand,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.290
in the second type of sliders,

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.640
which is discreet slider,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.650
you cannot modify it without any interruption.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.550
There are some fixed points that the user can choose from
