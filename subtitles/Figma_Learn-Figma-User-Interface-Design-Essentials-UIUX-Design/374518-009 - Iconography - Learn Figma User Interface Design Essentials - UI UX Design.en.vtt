00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
high in these video,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.520
we're gonna be talking about iconography in design.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.760
Iconography is a visual language used to demonstrate aspects,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.850
contents or functionality.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.580
Arkan's are meant to be simple and clear visual elements that are recognizable immediately

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.580
.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.250
You do not have to redesign well known icons such as home icon,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.940
search icon,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.420
etcetera or,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.260
let's say,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.980
do not reinvent the wheel.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.350
You can get access to almost all kinds of icons on websites for free or ads reasonable

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.190
costs.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.330
But what if you need it to design some icons specifically for your project?

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.790
Well,

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.790
in that case,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.420
you should design icons,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.750
which are in harmony with your design and other icons.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.610
Keep in mind that icons need to be understood easily by users,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.910
so make sure to show consistency in your design.
