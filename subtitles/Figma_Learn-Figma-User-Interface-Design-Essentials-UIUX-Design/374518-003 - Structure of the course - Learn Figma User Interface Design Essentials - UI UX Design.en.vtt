00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi everyone.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.295
In this video, we're gonna be talking about the structure of the course.

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:06.600
As a matter of fact,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.110
you can divide the course into two main sections.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.620
That theoretical part and the practical part.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.765
That theoretical part creates

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:22.904
10% of the whole course and the practical part forums 90% of the course content.

00:00:22.904 --> 00:00:25.455
So instead of focusing on theories,

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:28.200
we will focus on practicing the skills you learn

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.035
by working and different kinds of projects.

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:32.625
In the theoretical part,

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.085
you will learn about design basics,

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:38.790
UI elements, business ideas, et cetera.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.525
And in the practical part,

00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:44.375
we will design a complete mobile application from scratch.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:46.760
You will also learn about the essentials of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.075
web design by designing a modern landing page.

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:52.805
We also talking about wireframing,

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:55.204
3D modelling, logo design,

00:00:55.204 --> 00:00:56.735
and so much more.

00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:58.760
So if you're a complete beginner,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.385
I highly recommend to watch the theoretical part first and then proceed with the course.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:10.385
On the other hand, you can skip the theoretical part and jump into creating a project.

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:13.475
Alright guys, thank you so much for watching this video,

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:16.710
and I will see you in the next video.
