00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hi,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.930
everyone.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.890
And welcome back to another video of thes section in this video.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.560
We're going to design our profile screen together.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.100
OK,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.920
so without further ado,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.200
let's get it started by duplicating thes notification screen like this,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm going to rename me to profile pretty good.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.140
Then let's remove these elements in the search for as well.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.890
However,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.070
we're going to keep our tap our because we need to deactivate thes notification icon.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.540
And let's activate thes profile icon.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.050
Okay,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.080
Pretty good.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.850
All right.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.180
So what do we need for these Page?

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.990
First of all,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.870
we need a title,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.790
so I'm going to insert text.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.300
That's right profile.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.810
