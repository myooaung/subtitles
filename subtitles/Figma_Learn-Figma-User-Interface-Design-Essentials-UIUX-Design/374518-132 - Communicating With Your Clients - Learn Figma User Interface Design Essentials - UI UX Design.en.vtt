00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
Hi,

00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.960
everyone.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.210
In these video,

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.830
we're gonna be talking about communicating video clients.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.330
Efficient communication with clients plays a key role in any kind of business.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.720
And for designers,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.200
there are no exceptions.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.040
The way you interact with your clients is so important.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.750
If you want to be a successful entrepreneur,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.640
how should you handle the situation if something goes wrong?

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.590
Well,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.390
in any kind of business,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.140
there are times that something goes wrong and it's normal.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.130
However,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.570
the way you face these difficulties,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.880
it's so important.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.830
Suppose that you set a deadline to hand over the final project to the client and in the

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.560
middle of the design process,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.000
you understand that it might take longer.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.410
Well,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.850
in these case unity,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.630
inform your client about it as soon as possible and try to find a good solution that works

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.550
for both of you.
