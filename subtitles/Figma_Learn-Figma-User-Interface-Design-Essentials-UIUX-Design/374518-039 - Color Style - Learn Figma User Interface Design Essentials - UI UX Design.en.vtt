00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hello,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.870
everyone.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.070
And welcome back to another radio of these course in these video,

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.990
we're gonna be talking about the con Erstein's.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.920
So just like textile,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.510
you could create your own color sign.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.190
So first of all,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.700
let's go ahead and create a rectangle here and I'm gonna increase the corner radius to 40

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.850
like this.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.990
Then let's set the solid color to something like thes blue Pre denies and I'm going to

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.000
duplicate it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.770
And then let's change the capacity to 75% once again duplicated.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.720
And this time I'm going to change it to 50% and again I'm going to duplicate it.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.770
And now let's change it to 25%.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.480
Okay,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.190
so I just created four different colors with the same base color.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.010
However,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.790
with four different values,

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.490
as you can see,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.420
it gets lighter and lighter,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.910
so I'm going to select them,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.430
duplicate them,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.430
and here I'm going to choose another color as well.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.150
I think this one is great.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.740
So let's copy and paste thes hex color code for the others like this.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.470
Okay,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.680
but how can you create your own color?

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.150
Stein.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.440
It's so easy,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.090
just like textiles.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.610
First you need to select your object or your layer.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.630
And then here you can click on these four dots,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.350
and here you can click on this plus icon,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.330
which creates your color sign.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.110
So I'm going to write primary slash her po because it looks like a purple color.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.820
So I'm going to write primary slash purple and let's click and create style pretty good.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.800
Then I'm gonna choose this one,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.880
and let's do the same thing for this and this time the trying secondary slash pink.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.270
And for D swon,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.020
I can say primary purple,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.060
75% like this and it's fun.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.880
Primary purple,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.870
50% and so on are right,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.350
so,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.360
as you can see here,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.970
you have different colors.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:11.690
Styles.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.600
You have primary purple.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.860
We have secondary peeing primary purple,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.410
75% and so on.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.940
So how can you apply these color signs to your shapes or your objects?

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.990
It's so simple.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.450
So first of all,

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.450
let's create a new shape.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.210
Let's create a circle here like this,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.810
and in order to apply your color style,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.160
you can click and these four dots and here you can get access to your color science.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.880
Here you have primary here you have secondary.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.960
We created four different primary colors and only one secondary,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.050
and we will dive into creating your own design system in its own section in these course.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.380
So now I can choose Primary Purple,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.570
and that's all.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.870
I can duplicate it,

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.380
and here I can change it to secondary pink.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.910
Or if you want to change some properties off these shape,

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.360
we can detach it from its style by clicking and these icons like this and you can freely

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.130
change the color just like color styles.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.700
You can also create styles for effects or for a stroke.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.250
OK,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.300
so if you click on these for that's,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.780
you can create an effect style or a stroke start.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.250
So what are the advantages of using color styles in your projects,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.900
just like text times?

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.150
Creating your color science is gonna save you so much time,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.190
because if you decide to change this primary color later,

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.390
you can easily head over to these color style,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.070
and then you can modify it by clicking on this edit style icon like here,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.800
and changes with applying immediately are right guys,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.430
that's all for these video.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.050
I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video
