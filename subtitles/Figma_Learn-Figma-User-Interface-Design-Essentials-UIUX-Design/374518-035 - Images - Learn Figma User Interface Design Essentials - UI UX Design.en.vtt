00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.470
Hello,

00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:00.960
everyone.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.960
And welcome back to another video of thes scores.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.130
In these video,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.050
we're gonna be talking about images as a your UX designer.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.010
You work with images all the time and it's so important to know how it could use unique

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.720
features.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.970
Fatemeh,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.260
in order to use your images properly so without further I do.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.500
Let's get it started.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.140
As you can see,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:31.000
I have created a simple project here we just five circles and three squares and we're going

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.950
to add images to these circles and also these cars.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.190
There are plenty of ways that you could do that.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.540
The 1st 1 is to just drag and drop your images,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.210
and then you will use the mask option,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.490
which we will cover in the futures lessons.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.260
However,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.930
there are better ways to do that.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.590
So first,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.180
make sure to download the assets file that I already prepared for you.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.260
And it consists of some images for these cards and some images for these circles.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.570
So the first way is to go to shapes,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.500
and here we have placed image and if you have downloaded the assets file,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.480
you could see that you have two different fallers.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.510
Profile and cards in profile folder,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.700
you could see five different images,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.260
and I'm going to select all of them and click and open pretty good.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.530
Right at the top.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.670
You have two options.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.610
Place all discard all.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.710
If you click place,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.900
all all of your images will be placed at once like this.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.800
As you can see,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.950
you have all of your image is okay.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.070
And again,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.470
you need to go ahead and use masks in order to put it on those circles.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.040
Okay,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.150
so once again,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.100
I'm gonna open those images.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.430
And if you could weaken,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.050
discard all here.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.350
Nothing happens.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.990
You need to select once again.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.670
As we can see,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.580
there is a red badge on the top left corner of your images,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.140
which indicates the number of images that you have left.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.320
So,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.920
for instance,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.940
here we have five.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.590
If I click here,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.320
you can see that my first image will be inserted to the canvas.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.550
And now I have four.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.930
So I can go ahead and insert all of them.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.860
So let me select them once again in the previous way.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.160
You could place your images with their own dimensions.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.660
Okay.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.240
However,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.010
if you want to change the dimension.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.650
You can easily drag and drop like this.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.770
And there we go.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.900
You can set the dimension as you want are right.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.620
And the last time we're going to place these images in our circles.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.230
And it's so easy to do that.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.690
If you hover your mouse on top of these circles and click,

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.960
you can see that it's so easy to insert your image in those circles like this.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.660
And that's all.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.180
The next way you can insert an image in fig MMA is to use the field section.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.290
So I'm gonna hold command key and I'm going to select thes card.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.730
And here in feel if I open this drop menu,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.430
you can see that you have image option and you can choose your image like this.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.380
You can also change the exposure of your image.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.790
The contrast,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.030
the saturation temperature teamed,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.140
highlights and shadows right here.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.990
Okay,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.300
you can even rotate it if you want.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.860
All right,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.940
now we're going to add images to our cars,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.410
So let's go ahead and choose place image.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.140
And here I'm gonna open up cards.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.790
And as you can see,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.810
there are three different images here.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.850
I'm going to select all of them.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.910
You can open.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.440
You need to remember something.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.530
If your image is so large,

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.590
signal will resize it automatically before you could insert it to fig MMA.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.280
So you need to be ever of this issue as well like this.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.850
And thats done.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.010
Did you see how is it is to use images in fig MMA?

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.800
You could also edit This car's easily like this.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.730
There we go.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.450
Everything is responsive.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.430
That's pretty cool,

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.030
isn't it?

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.560
The good news is that unlike other suffers and platforms in fig Mama,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.250
you could insert a G file as well.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.870
So let's give it a try.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.490
So now if I previewed this art board by clicking on this play button,

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.980
you can see that these images are static.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.440
Okay,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.310
so what if I add a G file to one of these cards for incense?

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.030
This one?

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.550
I'm gonna go ahead and place an image from G folder.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.130
There we go now.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.040
As you can see,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.360
it's like other normal pictures.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.300
However,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.350
if I try to preview that,

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:36.070
you can see that it's actually different from other pictures because it's a gym file and it

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.960
plays in fig MMA which is pretty Ellison are right.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.360
Guys,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.560
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.650
I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.
