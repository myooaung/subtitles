00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.290
Hi,

00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.920
everyone.

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.590
Welcome back to another video of these course in this video,

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.650
we're gonna be talking about the layers panel knowing that how you could use the layers

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.490
panel properly is so important.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.370
It may seem easy to use,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.070
however,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.620
Sometimes it gets a little bit tricky in terms of reordering your layers and your objects.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.140
Okay,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.440
so let's dive into these parts,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.770
and I'm gonna show you how you could use it efficiently.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.760
So as you can see,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.130
you have the layers least on your left.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.470
And here you could see all your layers on your groups and also all your frames.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.800
Whenever you create a new shape or a new object,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.370
it goes to the top of this layers list.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.950
OK,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.940
so let's try it out.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.350
I'm going to create a rectangle here.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.720
As you can see,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.090
I have rectangle one and for renaming thesis rectangle.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.770
I'm going to double click on that.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.300
And that's candidates are one.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.020
Okay,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.630
then I'm going to create another shape.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.450
Let's create circle pretty good.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.360
I'm going to change the color in order to make it more visible.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.410
Pretty awesome.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.810
And I'm going to call it,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.210
see one Okay.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.600
As you can see C one has been placed to the top of this layers list.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.090
Okay?

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.870
And it appears to the front of your campus.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.200
So this is the reason that this circle is visible here.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.100
If I move this layer below are one.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.690
It's not visible anymore.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.350
However,

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.420
you could steal change its properties like its color or its size.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.310
And if I move it back to its previous position,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.610
you can see that it's visible again.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.660
So ordering your layers is so important.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.930
Now suppose that we're going to group our layers.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.780
Let's select these two shapes and hold command G.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.600
And as you can see,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.300
we just created Group One.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.650
And whenever you want to see the layers included in this group,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.430
you can use this small arrow next to these icon,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.300
which indicates that this is a group.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.800
Okay,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.050
I'm going to click on that,

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.660
and there we go for selecting a layer.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.410
You can easily click on that.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.920
Okay.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.750
And as you can see,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.280
a light blue box appears,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.050
nor to show that this layer has been selected.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.990
If you go to menu and go to preference,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.930
says you can see that you have different options here.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.480
One of them is highlight layers on hover.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.640
What does that mean?

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.870
It means that if you hover your mouse on top of each layer,

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.450
like,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.180
for example,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.460
see,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.070
Von,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.630
you can see on the canvas that the blue line will appear in order to show that this is your

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.730
desired layer.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.230
Okay,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.670
so I'm gonna select that.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.550
And if you want on group these layers,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.120
you can easily click on this group name and then right,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.800
kill here and you can click.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.640
And on group like that,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.390
I'm gonna use command Z or controls.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.620
Ian.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.050
Windows are right.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.220
So now what?

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.400
If you want to hide some layers,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400
It's so simple.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.300
Suppose that we're going to hide this circle,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.950
which is called C one.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.380
In order to do that.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.380
First of all,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.240
we need to hover on that specific layer life.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.710
This and then an eye icon appears immediately next to these padlock.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.860
So I'm going to click on this icon and you can easily target this layer off and on like

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.350
this.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.630
You can also like each layer by clicking on this padlock in order to prevent your layer

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.090
from accidental edit.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.980
So when you like your layer.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.730
You cannot move your layer.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.840
You cannot interact with your layer.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.390
However you can steal change its properties.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.930
So let's try it out.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.420
I'm gonna try to move this layer a little bit and as you can see because it has been liked

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.420
,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.830
I cannot move it.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.400
Okay,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.500
so its position is fixed,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.560
and you can use this technique for locking your bank grounds.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.470
Sometimes it may be useful,

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.190
however,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.190
Now let's try to change some of its properties.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.080
For instance,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.650
I'm going to change its color.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.960
And as you can see,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.750
I can steal get access to its properties.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.250
Although it has been liked.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.950
And in order to win like that,

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.320
you can again click on this padlock on.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.040
There we go.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.050
It's unlocked.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.350
You can recognize the type of each leg er on your layers,

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.670
least based on the icon next to its name.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.790
As you can see on the picture,

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.290
we have frame,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.750
we have groups.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.250
We have components that we will talk about in the future lessons.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.310
We have instances.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.230
We have tanks,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.010
object.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.110
We have shape image,

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.420
an animated GIF.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.010
OK,

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:47.310
so now let's talk about the positioning of your layers once again because I'm going to show

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.800
you how you can reorder the positioning of your layers right under canvas.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.910
Suppose that you wanna bring this square or let's say rectangle to the front.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:59.510
Okay,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.640
In order to do that,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.210
of course,

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.590
you can go to layers list and move it like this,

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.550
and it's done.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.740
However,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.490
there is an alternative for that.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.020
You can easy be a right click on that on canvas,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.150
and you can choose bringing to front.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.840
There we go.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.550
If you're familiar with Adobe Illustrator,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.910
you know that you could use the same functionality and dad software as well.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.870
Now let's go to the assets section here,

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.730
as you can see,

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.400
because we haven't created any components yet,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.320
we can see any components here.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.840
Basically,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.910
components are parts of your design that you can reuse.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.550
Okay,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.460
we will talk about it later,

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.890
and we will dive into components in the future lessons.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.410
We have another option here,

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.390
which is called pages and right at the top.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.850
As you can see here we have Page One,

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.360
and if I click on that,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.360
you can see that I have pages.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.730
It's called paid Ron.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.650
You can rename that I'm going to change you to a website.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.750
You can duplicate that if you just right click on that layer.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.950
As you can see,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.630
you can add a new page to this page list like this.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.370
We can call it Page two,

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.050
and the good news is that there is no limit for creating pages,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.370
so you're free to create as many pages as you want.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.020
For instance,

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.620
you could separate some parts of your design in order to make it clear when you're working

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.590
in a team or if you want to create different prototypes,

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.680
it's a good idea to have different pages as well.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.290
I'm gonna go to a website,

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.100
and that's all for this video.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.350
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.740
I hope you enjoyed it,

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.750
and I will see you in the next video.
