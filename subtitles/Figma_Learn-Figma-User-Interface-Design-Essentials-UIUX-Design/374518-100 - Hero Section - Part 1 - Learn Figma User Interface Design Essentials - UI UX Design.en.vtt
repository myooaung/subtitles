00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.815
Hi there, welcome back.

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:05.280
In this video, we're going to start designing our hero section.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.860
So without further ado, let's get started.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.570
What do we need for our hero section?

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.250
Let's take a look at our wireframe.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.680
Ok, so as you can see our hero section, a background, okay,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.270
and then a head dine at description of botton and an image on the right side.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.880
Okay, so I think it's a good idea to start designing

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.285
our background first and then move on to the other elements.

00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:28.490
So in order to keep everything organized,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.350
I'm going to press a key on my keyboard and let me add a new art board.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.660
Okay, so let me select Desktop and I'm gonna put it right next to my landing page.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.375
Let me zomemim. Alright, so for these background,

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.630
I'm going to use different gradients and different colors.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.294
And then with a cool technique,

00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:47.960
I'm going to show you how you can blend

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.390
the colors together to get a very cool background,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.115
which is so popular nowadays.

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:53.420
So for these background,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.310
I'm going to use the pen tool.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.105
Okay?

00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:58.355
Select the Pen tool in the tool bar,

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:00.380
and I'm going to create a node.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.185
So let me click somewhere here,

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:05.840
and I'm gonna move my mouse down like this,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.485
hold down the Shift key to get a straight line like this.

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:13.490
Click to create the second node and move it to the right side.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.945
Click like this.

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:16.400
And here is the tricky part.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.235
Now, I'm gonna create a curved line.

00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:20.765
Okay? How can I do that?

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:23.225
As you can see, if I just click somewhere,

00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:24.575
I will get a straight line.

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:25.925
But this is not what I want.

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:27.470
In order to get a curved line,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.060
you can click and drag,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.589
okay, like this, click and drag to get something like this.

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:37.730
And finally, close your path by clicking on your first node.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.865
Perfect. We've got our first shape,

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:42.920
but I'm going to modify it a little bit.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.945
So let me select the Move Tool,

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:47.870
and I'm going to click on this node in the middle.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.520
And using these handles,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.350
I can modify it like this.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.320
Ok, so I think now it looks good.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.050
All right, now it's time to add a color to it.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.080
But first of all, I'm going to remove the stroke from it using

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.260
this minus icon and then add a field to it.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.805
So for reduce first shape,

00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:09.080
I'm going to use our secondary dark color like this, okay?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.060
And then I'm gonna duplicate these shape,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.610
move it a little bit up like this.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.460
And finally I'm going to make it a little bit bigger.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.940
So hold down the Shift key and click and drag like this.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.780
But you can't see anything because both are layers have the same color.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.689
So now I'm gonna change it to accent.

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.245
And since these second layer is above our previous layer,

00:02:30.245 --> 00:02:33.080
we are not able to see our previous layer,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.450
so I'm going to move it down like this.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.835
There we go. Now both of them are visible.

00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:39.260
So far, so good. Okay.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.185
Let me rotate it a little bit to get something like this and I'm gonna make it larger.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:49.370
You can play around with these values and move your shapes however you want.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.865
Okay?

00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:51.260
All right, now it looks good.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.715
Then I need another shape.

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:55.790
So I am going to select the Pen tool and click here.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.185
Down here, like this, click somewhere here.

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:04.160
It doesn't matter how you drive now because these shape

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.330
is going to be under our previous layers, okay, like this.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.325
And I am going to put the next one here and connect them together like this.

00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:14.120
Pretty good.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.010
And now let me add a field to it.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.315
So I'm going to choose this primary color and let me move it

00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:24.950
down like this to put it under our previous layers.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.690
So far so good,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.015
but we make it a little bit larger.

00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:31.640
Right, and now I'm going to add more colors.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.550
Okay, so let me select the Pen tool again.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.915
This time click here will be down here and here to create a curved line like this.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:43.940
And let me add another color to it.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.350
Probably you could use a color different from our colors styles. Okay.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.795
And it's totally fine since it's a background,

00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:53.675
what I am going to choose is a light blue color.

00:03:53.675 --> 00:03:54.095
Okay.

00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:57.545
So let me change the hue, Something like this.

00:03:57.545 --> 00:03:59.630
Yeah, it looks good and as you can see,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.405
it has a very good harmony with our other colors.

00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:05.270
Okay, so the color code is 35,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.205
e c, and e c.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:07.850
There we go.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.155
Last but not least,

00:04:09.155 --> 00:04:13.205
we need another color to put right behind these shapes.

00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:15.410
But before that, as you can see,

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.655
these shape is outside my art board and it's a problem.

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:22.160
So if you head over to the layers list,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.850
you can click and drag it and put it inside our art board.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.745
And let me rename this art port to BG,

00:04:28.745 --> 00:04:30.304
which stands for Background.

00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:31.700
And last but not least,

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.825
let me create another shape to feel this white area with.

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:38.870
Okay, perfect, pretty good.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.510
And I'm going to choose something like orange.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.650
Okay, let's give it a try and see if it looks good.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.535
Let me put this layer inside our art board and move it down.

00:04:49.535 --> 00:04:50.375
Fantastic.

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:53.570
Alright, as you can see, we have a very good color combination.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.404
However, it doesn't look good for our background.

00:04:56.404 --> 00:04:57.875
How can we make it look good?

00:04:57.875 --> 00:04:59.914
Let me show you a very good technique.

00:04:59.914 --> 00:05:03.350
What I'm gonna do now is select this BG,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.270
copied it command C,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.005
and select your landing page and pace it. Hit Command V.

00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:13.745
I'm gonna put it under our navigation bar and move it up like this.

00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:16.445
And then I'm going to add an effect to it.

00:05:16.445 --> 00:05:21.185
Ok, so if you head over to the Effects section and click on this plus icon,

00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:22.565
you can add an effect to it,

00:05:22.565 --> 00:05:25.310
but by default it's set to drone shadow.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.970
I'm gonna change it to layer by layer like this.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.445
And then if I click on this sun icon,

00:05:31.445 --> 00:05:33.740
I can modify this Blair amount,

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.570
okay, to whatever I want.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.185
So I'm going to use the slider, okay, like this,

00:05:39.185 --> 00:05:42.950
I'm going to increase it to blend all those colors.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.560
Okay, can you see how beautiful it is now?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.415
So we've just created a beautiful background for our landing page

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:53.405
using this simple technique and using simple shapes actually.

00:05:53.405 --> 00:05:58.700
Alright, now I'm going to modify my colors a little bit to get a better result.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.375
So first of all, I'm gonna change these orange to something else.

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:06.215
So let me choose my accent color are right, it looks good.

00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:10.160
And also, I'm going to modify this blue color a little bit.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.660
Let me make it darker to get something like this.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.665
Fantastic.

00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:18.815
And also I'm gonna change these secondary color a little bit.

00:06:18.815 --> 00:06:23.870
So what I'm gonna do is select this element and make it a little bit smaller, okay?

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.955
And select these vector to layer,

00:06:25.955 --> 00:06:27.725
which is a little bit up.

00:06:27.725 --> 00:06:30.500
And also I think we need to add another color for

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.370
our transition here between these acts and color and this blue color.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.140
Okay, so what I'm gonna do is select this vector 5-layer Copy and Paste.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.790
It will be to derive side.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.195
It's not visible because it's under our other layers.

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:49.520
Get up in the layers list like this and change the color to something else.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.525
But before that, we need to detach it from its style like this.

00:06:53.525 --> 00:06:56.675
And let me change it to something like this.

00:06:56.675 --> 00:07:02.165
Ok, the color code is for E, f for pay.

00:07:02.165 --> 00:07:04.670
And now I'm going to rotate it a little bit.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.730
It's getting better and better as you can see, pretty good.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.430
And finally, let's change these blue color,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.885
gets a better result,

00:07:11.885 --> 00:07:13.070
are right, pretty good.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.930
We need to do one more thing, okay?

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.830
As you can see, now that the added these blurry effect to our background,

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.200
we've got some white color on the sides.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.715
Okay, and I'm going to fix that.

00:07:22.715 --> 00:07:23.585
How can I do that?

00:07:23.585 --> 00:07:25.610
We just need to scale these background.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.410
Okay, press key on your keyboard to select the scale tool and

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.675
hold down the Shift key and try to scale it like this from both sides.

00:07:35.675 --> 00:07:37.580
And now it looks better.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.735
And as you can see,

00:07:38.735 --> 00:07:41.525
although we added these Larry fake to our background,

00:07:41.525 --> 00:07:46.430
we could recognize the borders and lines between these colors and it's not good.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:52.790
So we should increase the amount of layer Blair to eliminate those lines like this.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.980
And now it looks much,

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.840
much smoother, pretty good.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.330
So we have successfully created our background,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.485
but we are not done.

00:08:00.485 --> 00:08:05.120
There is one more single-step to do and that is masking our background.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.850
As a matter of fact, you could leave it as it is and

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.865
try to add your hero sections element here.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:14.840
However, I'm going to change its shape to something fancy.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.750
Okay, so let me select the Pen tool and I'm going to

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.855
create a node here at the top left corner.

00:08:20.855 --> 00:08:24.545
It's outside of our landing page and I know it, it's totally fine.

00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:26.105
We're gonna fix it in a minute.

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:28.250
Then click here to create another node.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.800
And now I'm going to create a wave line.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.135
Okay? To do that,

00:08:32.135 --> 00:08:34.700
I can click and drag like this.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.385
And then I'm going to click and drag here.

00:08:37.385 --> 00:08:39.335
Fantastic, movie it up,

00:08:39.335 --> 00:08:41.405
click here, click here,

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:43.235
and connect it to your first node.

00:08:43.235 --> 00:08:48.065
Okay, then let's remove the stroke from it and add a solid color to it.

00:08:48.065 --> 00:08:53.285
So first of all, let me modify this curve using these handles.

00:08:53.285 --> 00:08:56.195
So I'm going to select that node, okay?

00:08:56.195 --> 00:08:57.875
Pretty good. All right,

00:08:57.875 --> 00:08:59.390
I think it looks perfect.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.540
Alright, now we should move these shape that we just

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.020
created and put it right below our background.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.125
Okay, RBG inside our landing page,

00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:11.735
make sure that it's inside our landing page.

00:09:11.735 --> 00:09:13.280
Alright, now it's inside, okay,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.075
but it's not visible because our background is bigger than that.

00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:18.890
As you can see, we have a frame here,

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.590
but in order to mask it properly, first,

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:27.215
we need to change it from the frame to group so I can hit Command Z or Control Z,

00:09:27.215 --> 00:09:28.910
and I'm going to call it BG.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.510
And then hold down the Shift key, select vector seven,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.510
the shape that we just created and our background and

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:39.380
heat the Mask icon Toolbar. There we go.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.225
We've just mask our background.

00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:44.270
And this is exactly the result I was looking for.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.010
Can you see how beautiful it is?

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.855
If you add some content to it,

00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:49.234
it's going to look amazing.

00:09:49.234 --> 00:09:50.945
Now we could modify it a little bit.

00:09:50.945 --> 00:09:54.380
So if you select these vector seven and press enter,

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:58.790
Now you are in the edit mode and you can select this node and modify it.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.420
Okay, I think if we could modify this curve,

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.145
it would be much, much better.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:08.330
The last thing we need to do is change the color of our menu items.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.835
As you can see, we don't have a good contrast

00:10:10.835 --> 00:10:13.475
since we use the default color for these items.

00:10:13.475 --> 00:10:15.200
So I am going to select all of them,

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.615
hold down the Shift key and click on them,

00:10:17.615 --> 00:10:20.104
and change the field to white.

00:10:20.104 --> 00:10:23.210
Perfect. Alright guys, that's all for this video.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.350
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.430
In the next video,

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.085
we will finish designing our hero section together.

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:29.910
So see you then.
