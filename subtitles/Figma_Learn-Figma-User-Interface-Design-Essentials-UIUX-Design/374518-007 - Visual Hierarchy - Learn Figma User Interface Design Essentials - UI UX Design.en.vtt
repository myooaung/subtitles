00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.420
Hi,

00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.370
everyone in these video,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.350
we're gonna be talking about visual hierarchy.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.450
Visual hierarchy is about how we look at designs.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.270
Does it sound?

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.750
Were.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.050
So let's put it in another way.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.040
We,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.200
as designers,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.860
should put ourselves in users shoes in order to realize how they see our designs.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.310
Content in any digital page layout will pursue a particular hierarchy.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.970
For instance,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.180
menus go to the top bottom left or right of the screen,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.180
or a combination of these headers appear above body tapes.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.870
In other words,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.060
hierarchy is a simple way of staying organized from most to least important.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.070
Remember that users defined hierarchy of any app or website.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.870
The item that first grabs the user's attention is at the top of the hierarchy.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.450
The visual specifications that the designer can utilize to influence users,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.340
understanding of the information,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.740
our size,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.700
the larger the element,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.050
the more attention it will attract.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.090
So if you're familiar with the HTML and what development process,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.150
you may know that we have six kind of headers from H one to H six.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.090
H one is the largest header,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.080
and H seeks is the smallest on.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.120
So when we want to get so much attention.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.810
We will use each one.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.650
For instance,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.560
suppose that we want to get the user's attention to a specific section or specific item,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.380
so in that case we will use the larger header.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.000
Or on the other hand,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.630
sometimes we don't want to get so much attention to a specific section or content.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.960
In that case,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.790
we can use the smaller header so size is so important.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.250
The next item is collar.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.790
Bright colors are more noticeable than muted ones.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.170
If you do not have enough information about colors,

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.890
you don't have to worry about it because in the next lessons,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.450
we will cover all the necessary information about choosing the right color in your design.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.050
The next item is alignment.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.590
An element with a different alignment of others will attract more attention.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.920
So what does that mean?

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.170
Suppose that you have a layout off,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.980
Let's say,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.350
four different videos or four different photos.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.560
If you align Onley one off those videos or those photos differently,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.810
it will draw more attention to it.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.130
As a matter of fact,

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.240
in that case,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.170
the user can realize that something is different.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.250
The next item is contrast.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.590
Sharply contrasting colors will catch the eye easily.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.000
Contrast is a very,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.060
very important topic in you I design,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.840
and we will talk about contrast in next lessons.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.520
Deeply.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.740
The next item is proximity Elements,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.960
which are placed closely together,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.510
appear more related.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.730
And that's true.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.520
If you look at the pictures on the right side,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.700
you can see we have two different screens.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.800
Let's focus on the left screen.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.800
As you can see,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.870
we have two different sections,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.550
new promotions and new stories.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.340
Can you realize that elements in both sections are placed closely together so that users

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.440
can easily understand that they're related together?

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.420
The next item is repetition.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.690
Repeating styles can indicate that content is related.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.450
So what does that mean?

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.590
Let's look at the pictures on the right.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.310
Can you see that we have four squares at three circles,

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.820
so the user can easily recognize the relationship between those elements.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.040
And the next item is white space,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.650
which is another important term in ur ux design.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.100
More space between elements will draw more attention to them,

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.810
so let's look at the pictures on the right.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.000
But this time we need to distinguish between the left screen and the right screen As you

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.590
can see in the left screen,

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.450
we have enough space.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.740
Or let's say,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.280
enough whitespace between our elements and our sections so the users can easily wife

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.280
through the user interface.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.140
However,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.470
on the right screen,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.980
you can see that all elements are very,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.290
very close together.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:54.750
And there is not enough white space between all elements in that kind of layout.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.440
All right,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.750
thank you so much for watching this video.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.240
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.550
And I will see you in the next video.
