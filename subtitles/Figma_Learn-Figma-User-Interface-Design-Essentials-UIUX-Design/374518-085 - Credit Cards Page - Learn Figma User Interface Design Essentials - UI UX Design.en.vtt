00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
Hi,

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.900
everyone.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.060
And welcome back to another video of the scores in these video.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.880
We're going to design our cars screen together.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.170
So without her,

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.750
I do.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.940
Let's get a started.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.770
First off,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.740
I'm gonna go ahead and select these homepages screen duplicated,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.950
and I'm gonna move it right below our or TV screen.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:19.810
Really good.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.610
Then we need to remove some elements.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.150
Okay,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.950
so first of all,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:30.160
let's remove thes tap are then discard discard as well this profile image and also these

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.430
hamburger menu icon.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.970
Okay.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.500
However,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.170
we need to have these back home indicator.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.510
So let's copy and paste it here pretty good.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.030
And also,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.150
we need to have thes left arrow.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.280
So I'm gonna copies and paste it here with the same position.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.720
Actually,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.830
Friedman automatically recognised the previous position of this left arrow.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.390
Okay,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.010
then let's you mean a little bit.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.980
And in this screen,

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.340
actually,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.930
we need to have so many elements.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.410
Okay,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.860
First,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.290
we need to have a title,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.500
so that's right.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.530
You can check your cards here like this.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.740
Then I'm going to resize it pretty good on after that.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.730
I'm going to change you too bold.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.030
And also let's set the left padding to 30 pixels like this,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.330
The top heading is going to be 80 peak cells.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.900
Okay,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.510
so far,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.050
so good.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.790
Then we need to have two different cards,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.700
the primary card and the second Ricard.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.240
Okay.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.040
And after that,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.590
we need to have the recent transaction section.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.370
So first of all,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.240
let's create our primary card.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:41.830
I'm going to create a rectangle like this that set the with 2 209 and the high to 305 like

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.360
this.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.840
And I'm going to change the corner radius to 40 and also remember to make those corners

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.750
smooth like this.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.040
And now I'm going to show you a very great technique.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.550
Okay,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.300
We're going to create a great background for our primary card using radial Grady INTs.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.830
Okay,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.690
and I'm going to set it to white.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.220
It's on a white background,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.490
and after that,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.150
we need to create our radial Grady INTs.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.680
Okay,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.600
one by one.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.280
So I'm going to change the Grady into radio,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.860
okay.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.700
And let's set the first color to 40 the three and F two like this,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.690
and let's copy and paste thes color code for the second color as well however,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.300
remember to keep the capacity off the second color to 0% like this.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.100
And now I'm gonna go ahead and change the direction of these collar.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.650
Okay,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.420
let's move it like this pretty good.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.800
And now let's add another Grady int.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.250
So it's gonna be radio as well.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.790
And let's set the color to E 100 double F.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.870
That's competence and pace it for the second color.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.770
Pretty good.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.590
And I'm going to change the direction like this.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.000
Let's make it larger,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.020
fantastic.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.630
And we need one more Grady int as well.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.810
So let's go ahead and add another radial Grady int,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.410
and I'm going to change the counter to to be 47 f c like this.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.050
I'm going to copy this and pace it for the second color,

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.650
and I'm going to change the direction to here.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.520
Let's make it larger pretty good.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.250
Now I'm gonna modify the directions a little bit to get the best results possible.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.810
Okay,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.900
All right.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.680
That's modifying these light.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.580
Do as well.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.210
Can you see how simple it is to create these kinds of backgrounds are right Now it's time

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.670
to add a text layer to this card so I'm gonna insert a text layer and that's right.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.750
4000 on $500 like this,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.290
I'm gonna make it white pretty good.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.390
The fund size is OK,

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.890
so on when a movie to the left side let me zoom mean it Stop hiding is going to be 38

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.610
pixels and it's left fighting.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.790
Should be 24 picks elves like this,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.270
then that's duplicated.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.800
Move it down and here I'm going to write the title of this card.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.230
Okay,

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.780
so let's say that this card is for a company count.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:14.050
So I'm going to write company and it's decreased the fun size to 18 points pretty good,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.320
and the top heading is going to be three pixels like this.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.000
Then let's add another text layer for the expiration date of this card,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.640
and I'm going to write 01 2020.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.280
Let's make it a regular,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.500
and also I'm going to change the font size to 14 points on Let's change the color to White

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.370
as well.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.200
Pretty good.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.780
Now we need to align it.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.620
It's left fighting should be 24 picks owns and its bottom padding should be 72 pixels.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.290
Okay,

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.360
like this duplicated.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.570
Move it down.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.420
And here we need to write the card number.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.640
So I'm going to use stars for the 1st 12 digits like this.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.440
And for the last four digits,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.230
less right,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:04.150
22 04 and its top heading should be 14 pixels like this.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.900
The last thing we need to add to this card is the logo off the master card.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.490
Okay,

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.790
so I'm gonna go ahead and place an image and from the local folder,

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.930
I'm gonna choose MasterCard ago.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.330
Let's place it here.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.300
Fantastic.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.940
I'm gonna move it down.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.870
And its bottom padding should be 32 pixels and the right padding should be 22 pixels.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.430
Okay,

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.330
like this.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.170
And now everything is great.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.380
So let's go ahead and select all these elements because we need to group them and it's

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.120
Collett MasterCard.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.100
And the last thing we need to do is adding a drop shadow to this card.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.490
Okay,

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.480
so I'm going to open it up and let's choose the rectangle,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.250
which is our base card on That's at effects to this pretty good drop shadow.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:06:00.340
I'm going to set the amount to 49 a Y to nine and then Let's change the color to 59 88 and

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.230
f eight like this.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.390
And let's decrease the capacity to 20%.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.310
Fantastic.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.490
And as you can see,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.790
we just created our first card,

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.270
which is the primary one.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.810
Okay,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.290
it's stop adding is going to be 16 pix Els.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.950
Perfect.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.560
Now it's time to create our secondary card.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.050
Okay,

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.290
so I'm going to duplicate this one pretty good.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.780
Then I'm gonna choose the scale tool,

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.230
and I'm going to scale it down like this.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.150
And I think there,

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.900
with 177 is a perfect dimension for this.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.410
Okay,

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.210
I'm gonna move it to the right side.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:41.440
The left padding should be 24 pixels and remember to align them vertically like this.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.110
What are we going to change for these cart?

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.860
The first thing which is the most important one,

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.840
is the background.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.610
So I'm going to remove all these Grady ins because you're going to have a solid white color

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.340
then that select all the text layers pretty good,

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.880
and I'm going to set the color code 23 a three a and three A.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.360
Pretty good that I'm going to change these amount to 4000 like this,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.350
and also these company takes to home.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.010
And the last thing we need to change is the color of our drop shadow.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:22.170
So I'm going to select this rectangle 14 and let's modify the color to black.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.740
However we 10% capacity now it looks right.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.270
All right,

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.970
now it's time to create our recent transaction section.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:30.570
OK,

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.980
so first of all,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.550
I'm gonna have a title.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.550
That's right.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.470
Recent transactions.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.650
I'm gonna increase the fund size to 22.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.920
It's gonna be bold,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.100
and the fund should be Monsour it.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.440
So everything is perfect except the color code.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.730
So I'm going to change it to three a three a and three a like this.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:54.890
Then let's align it.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:55.390
It's left.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.510
Fighting should be 30 peak cells like this and also before got to check the left padding of

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.250
this card.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.310
So let's select both off them.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.070
As you can see,

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.880
the left padding is said to 32 pixels.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.960
I'm going to make it 30 now.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.750
It's great.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.480
So what do we need here?

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.690
We need to create three different transactions,

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.830
re title price and an icon.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.300
Okay,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.190
so first of all,

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.130
let's create another text layer.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.330
Let's suppose that the first transaction is related to shopping,

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:30.330
so I'm going to write shopping that's selected and I'm gonna make it regular.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.040
And also let's decrease the font size to 18 points Pretty good.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.240
I'm going to change the color CO 23 a 3 a.m. and three A.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.760
Like this duplicated and move it down.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.290
And now we need to write the exact time and date for these transaction.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:58.130
So let's write 15 March 2019 on Let's Write 8:20 p.m. And then let's decrease the font size

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.560
to 16 points.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.320
And also the color CO.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.340
Two B,

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:02.970
F,

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:03.360
B,

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.340
F and B F like this.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.680
I think it's better to decrease the font size to 12 points.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.990
Maybe yes,

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.940
it's great.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.630
And the top hiding should be four pixels.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.770
So now everything is great.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.090
Then what else do we need?

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.630
We need an icon right at the left,

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:26.120
so I'm gonna go ahead and create a circle like this.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.820
It should be 48 by 48 pixels.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:35.370
And then let's change the color co two double F C F and 87 Fantastic.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.170
And after that,

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:41.350
I'm gonna bring the specific icon that I already prepared for you icons.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.080
And here transactions.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.950
We have four different icons.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.270
But for these screen,

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.650
we need only three that shoes shopping and place it here pretty good.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.530
I'm gonna align them vertically and horizontally.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.130
However,

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:59.400
sometimes you need to allowing your elements manually in order to get a great visual

00:09:59.400 --> 00:09:59.900
balance.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.440
OK,

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.960
so I'm going to move it up by two pixels.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.980
And now I think it looks great.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.990
Then let's group it and I'm going to college Shopping icon.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.080
Fantastic.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:16.710
Then let's group these two text layers and align it with your icon vertically.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:17.650
Pretty good.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:22.390
And the left parting of this text group should be eight pixels like this.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.860
So what else do we need?

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.250
We need to have the amount right here.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.020
And also a small arrow.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.620
Okay,

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.020
so I'm gonna select thes,

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:30.890
takes layer,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.000
copied and paste it.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.550
Then I'm gonna move it outside this group of it to the right side.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:42.900
And let's change the font size to 16 points and remember to align it to the right side.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.290
I'm going to show you why,

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.360
and that's right.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.430
Minus $120.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.150
Pretty good.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.600
And let's align it with your text group like this.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.520
And after that,

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.020
I'm going to need a small arrow.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.600
So let's place it all right.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.250
We have small arrow here,

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.030
pretty good.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.590
However,

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.950
we need to change its color to C seven,

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.400
C seven and C seven like this.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:07.890
Remember,

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.700
when you want to change the color,

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.130
you need to select the shape,

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.460
not thes frame.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.980
The shape is here.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.350
Okay,

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.120
so if you want to get access to the shape easily,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.110
you can hold command.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.710
Can your keywords or control key if you're using windows?

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.270
Okay,

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.390
then let's align it with this text pretty good.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:26.060
And it's right.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.750
Padding is going to be 30 pixels,

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.850
and the right padding of thes amount should be 16.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.230
Pixels like this are right.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.510
Everything is great.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.070
So let's select all these elements.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.050
Group them and college shopping are right.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:47.870
The top heading of these transactions should be 12 pixels like this.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.350
Then let's duplicate it,

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.710
move it down,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.710
and the distance between them should be 16 pixels like this.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.130
Let's rename me to medicine,

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.320
and this one is going to be related to the medicine self.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:06.380
So let's change these title to medicine and also we need to change the time.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:15.390
So I'm going to write 13 March 2019 and let's change it to 12 and 10 a.m. Okay,

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:20.070
the amount should be changed to $89.890.50.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.980
And the reason that I told you you need to align these text layer to the right side is

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.210
because when we are changing the amount,

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.570
he's text layer should grow from the left side,

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:31.830
not to the right side.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.320
OK,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.220
and finally,

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:41.020
let's use these circle and I'm going to change the color to be 09 and f f f pretty good.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:48.280
Let's remove thes icon and I'm gonna place the medicine icon from thes Transactions folder

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:48.280
.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.590
Put it here and I'm gonna align it with my circle both horizontally and vertically.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:59.260
Remember to put this medicine icon inside thes medicine group.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:12:59.800
Okay,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.600
now let's duplicate thes transaction,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.010
and I'm going to change it to sport.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:14.660
Then let's change the time to 10 March 2019 and the time should be 6 50 PM and that's

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.630
changed the amount to 99.90.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:19.580
And after that,

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.460
that's remove these icon choose this circle and changed a bank run color,

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.150
too.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.850
87 F zero and double F and its place.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.350
It's specific icon sport.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.880
Place it here and aligning to be Dior Simple.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.670
Both resented Lee and vertically.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:42.940
Then remember to rename your group as well to sport are right everybody.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.990
We successfully designed our cars screen together.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:52.470
The last thing you need to do is renaming this art board two cards and that's all for this

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.970
video.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.240
I hope you enjoyed it,

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.490
and I will see you in the next video.
