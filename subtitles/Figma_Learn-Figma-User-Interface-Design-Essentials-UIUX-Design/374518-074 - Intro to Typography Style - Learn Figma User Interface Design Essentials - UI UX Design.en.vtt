00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
high in these video,

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.300
we're gonna be talking about the text time,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.320
just like what we did with our colors we're now going to be doing with our typography.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.690
So in these section,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.070
we're going to be creating our own textile.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.190
And we need to set different sizes,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.100
different weights and also different colors to our typography style in order to use it in

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.990
our project.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.350
So I would see you in the next video.
