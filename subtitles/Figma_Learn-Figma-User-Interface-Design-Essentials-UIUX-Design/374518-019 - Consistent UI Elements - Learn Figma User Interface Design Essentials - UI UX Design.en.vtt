00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.610
Hi,

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.210
everyone.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.350
In these video,

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.140
we're gonna be talking about consistency of your elements.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.940
One of the things that you always work Fifth,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.850
while you're designing a user interface is au element.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.290
What are the EU elements?

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.680
Bottoms,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.700
cards,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.930
text fields,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.160
sliders,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.370
dialogues,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.470
charts,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.700
steps,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.790
tables,

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.440
selection controls,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.500
menus,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.000
snack bars,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.890
etcetera.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.700
As it conceding the picture.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.980
I chose only some of them for you because certainly I could not put all of them here.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.770
However,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.200
you will learn about almost all of them in the U Elements chapter.
