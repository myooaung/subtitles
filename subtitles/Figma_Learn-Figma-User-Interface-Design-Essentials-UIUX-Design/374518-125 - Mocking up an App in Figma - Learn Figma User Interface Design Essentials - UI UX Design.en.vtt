00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.290
Hi,

00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.850
everyone.

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.440
And welcome back to another video of thes course in this video.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.760
I'm going to show you how you can create a markup in fig MMA.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.330
Okay,

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.140
first of all,

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.850
I'm gonna ask you to open up the freebies.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.980
You any website?

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.590
And when you opened it up,

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.980
let's search for fig MMA like this,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.590
and I'm going to scroll down,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.640
and I think it's a good example.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.190
Let's click on that pretty good.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.980
I'm going to scroll down,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.200
and here you can click on download freebie,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.050
and it will be opened in your figment.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.610
Okay.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.860
And here you have different examples.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.590
I'm gonna go ahead and choose this screen one competence and it's pasted in our project

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.160
here.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.340
Fantastic.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.280
I'm gonna move it to the right side.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.960
Great.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.030
Let me zoom Mean.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.330
And as you can see here,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.620
you have different layers.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.160
Okay?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.950
If you open up the screen here,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.290
you have your design.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.740
And here is the image.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.600
So I'm going to select that and it's place an image.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.370
Okay,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.150
If you remember,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.800
we already exported our home pages screen once.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.390
However,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.270
if you didn't,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.870
you could go ahead and export any of these articles.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.370
Okay?

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.860
Then let's place it here and click our right.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.590
As you can see,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.830
it has been flipped horizontally.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.830
So I'm going to right click on that.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.570
And that's Quicken the presentable.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.470
That's Oh,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.510
can you see how easy it is to create your markup in fig?

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.220

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.620

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.250
That's all for this video.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.450
