00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.039
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:02.039 --> 00:00:06.540
In this video, we are going to finish designing our landing page together.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.435
The last thing we need to design is the footer.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.055
You can find a website footer,

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:14.220
usually at the bottom of the website, ok.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.215
And it consists of a copyright disclaimer, some relevant resources.

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:24.180
And also you could have a call to action such as a newsletter subscriptions,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.710
and the logo of the company.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.080
Okay, so we're going to keep it so simple.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.325
Let's take a look at our wireframe.

00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:33.619
As you can see, we have nine different links.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:36.470
We have a logo and some text,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.419
which is our copyright notice.

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:41.300
All right, without further ado, let's get started.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.475
First of all, we need to create a rectangle as our footers background,

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:51.545
okay, like this, I'm going to set the height to 440, okay?

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:55.670
And then I'm going to change the color code to DC,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.815
E2, and f z.

00:00:57.815 --> 00:01:02.255
So to create a good contrast ratio with our background's color,

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:04.385
now, we need to place our logo here.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:05.720
I'm gonna scroll up.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.879
There we go. Here is our logo.

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:11.540
Copy it, scroll down and paste it here.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.750
I'm gonna press key on my keyboard to scale it.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.160
Think it's too much.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.055
Let's make it something like this.

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:22.880
Alright, I'm gonna change the width to 80.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.005
All right, it's cool.

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:26.435
Let me unhide my layout grids.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:29.510
I'm gonna place it here and the second column.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.785
And right below that,

00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:33.080
we need to have our copyright notice.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.250
So I am going to create a text layer and let's write copyright and

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.890
a copyright sign 20-20 draft LLC are right,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.705
and let's write all rights reserved.

00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:51.575
If you don't know how to type this copyright sign,

00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:56.330
you can hold down the option key on your keyboard if you're a Mac user and press g,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.175
And if you are a Windows user,

00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:03.635
you need to hold down the Alt key and type the number 0169.

00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:06.125
If you don't have a key pad on your keyboard,

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:09.455
you can just look for copyright,

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:11.690
sign in Google, okay?

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.560
And you will find something like this and you can select it, pay,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.270
it's a good technique, copy it and come over here and paste it.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.295
That's all. It does the same thing,

00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:26.300
r Right now I'm gonna change the text style to buy the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.395
main and let me change the color to secondary light.

00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:33.140
And finally, I'm going to align it are right,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.160
as you can see here,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.460
I get 30.67, okay?

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.375
And the problem is with the frame size of my logo,

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:43.100
okay, since I scaled it,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.885
I didn't get a rounded number.

00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:46.550
Ok, so don't worry about it.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.825
It's totally fine.

00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:49.010
In order to fix that,

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.245
you can modify your frame size,

00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:54.230
but for now, we're gonna leave it as ears.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.350
Okay, the next thing we need to create is our links.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.840
So let me create a new takes layer.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.745
And here I am going to write team and it's going to be by the main, so it's fine.

00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:08.510
And it's color is going to be secondary, dark like this.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.280
Let me move it to the left side.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.585
I'm gonna duplicate it.

00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:15.455
Movie down here, I'm going to write, press.

00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:18.740
Once again duplicated movie down here,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.420
I'm gonna write fees.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.295
Each of them is a link, okay?

00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:27.875
So the padding between them is going to be 44 pixels, like this.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.225
Okay, pretty cool.

00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:30.770
I'm going to move them up,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.515
duplicate them, move them to the right side.

00:03:33.515 --> 00:03:37.220
And here I'm gonna write services.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.820
Then I'm going to write projects.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.065
And the last one,

00:03:42.065 --> 00:03:44.090
I'm going to write affiliate.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.210
And once again we need to select them,

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.850
duplicate them, move them to the right side.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.440
And here I'm going to write a terms of use for the second one,

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.200
I'm going to write privacy policy and then I'm going to write contact us.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.495
Perfect, alright, so let's select these 3 first LINCS,

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.975
group them, and then select the second column links.

00:04:08.975 --> 00:04:11.600
Once again group them and the last one,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.105
and now select all three groups.

00:04:14.105 --> 00:04:16.940
And I'm gonna go ahead and distribute

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.785
horizontal spacing between them that they can easily modify the padding in between.

00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:26.915
So the padding between them is going to be 110 pixels like this.

00:04:26.915 --> 00:04:29.735
You can modify it from the inspector as well,

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:33.425
then grouped them, let's call it links. Pretty good.

00:04:33.425 --> 00:04:37.295
Alright, now let me put it to the right side like this,

00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:40.670
and then I'm going to select our rectangle,

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.000
this background, and align it to the center vertically.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.300
And also, we need to select these copyright notice,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.820
hold down the Shift key and select our logo,

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.080
group them and select our rectangle and align them vertically as well.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.920
Pretty good.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.540
Last but not least,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.895
we need to select all these elements,

00:04:58.895 --> 00:05:02.015
group them, and we're going to call it footer.

00:05:02.015 --> 00:05:02.705
Perfect.

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:05.585
We have one little issue here and that is,

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:07.805
we don't have so much whitespace,

00:05:07.805 --> 00:05:09.005
so we need to fix it.

00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:11.390
It's set to 68 pixels.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.020
However, I'm gonna set it to 160 pixels.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.950
Okay, so I'm gonna select landing page and increase the height like this. Moving down.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.030
Let's see.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.460
Okay, it's too much are right,

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.080
I'm gonna decrease it.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.885
Now I have 169.

00:05:29.885 --> 00:05:31.670
So I'm going to select a landing page.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.350
And here for the height,

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.825
I'm going to write minus nine like this and move this footer up.

00:05:38.825 --> 00:05:40.520
There we go. All right guys,

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.634
that's all for this video.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.840
Are landing pages finally ready?

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.044
And now let's preview together.

00:05:47.044 --> 00:05:48.080
Are you ready?

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.315
Let's go. Okay, pretty cool.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:53.225
So here is our hero section.

00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:54.965
I'm gonna scroll down.

00:05:54.965 --> 00:05:57.125
All right guys, that's all for this video.

00:05:57.125 --> 00:06:00.665
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next video.

00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:02.580
So see you then.
