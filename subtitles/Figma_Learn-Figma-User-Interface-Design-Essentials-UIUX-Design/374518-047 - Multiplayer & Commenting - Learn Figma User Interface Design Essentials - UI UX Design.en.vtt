00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Hi,

00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.770
everyone.

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.590
And welcome back to another video of these course in these video,

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.070
we're gonna be talking about multiplayer and commenting.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.520
Okay.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.420
As a matter of fact,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.760
Sigma has powerful features in order to make the collaboration off designers easy.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.620
So as I already mentioned,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.220
you can easily share your project with this blue button.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.730
So if I click on that,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.550
as you can see,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.790
I already invited one person.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.640
And I defined a setting that he can edit this project.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.240
And then he received an email from Fatemeh.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.730
He accepted that and from now on,

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.020
he can collaborate with me in order to edit this project.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.510
OK,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.360
so as you can see in the toolbar,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.550
there are two people viewing this project.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.840
The 1st 1 is me.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.940
The 2nd 1 is this person,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.990
which is also mean this tutorial.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.190
So now I'm gonna show you how you can use that.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.370
Let me switch to this.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.790
You I design account.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.600
There we go.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.310
Suppose that I choose this layer.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.890
Okay.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.950
If I go back to my main account,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.410
you can see that it has been selected already.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.110
Okay.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.120
By who?

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.200
This year I designed.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.540
So if I change the position of my cursor here.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.510
We can see that it will immediately change in this project as well.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.470
Or let's select another object.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.430
For example,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.270
this menu and there we go.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.980
You Any design is doing something with this layer.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.500
Okay?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.420
And if I select the background here,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.490
this is my account.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.030
When I switched to the other account,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.790
you can see this purple stroke,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.690
which indicates that I chose this background.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.270
Okay,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.930
you can see these colors in the toolbar in order to recognize which person is selecting

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.810
which object.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.010
It is pretty cool,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.750
isn't it?

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.010
Now suppose that I want to add some comments here.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.580
Okay,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.510
So in the toolbar,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.000
right next to our text tool,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.240
there is another icon for commenting.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.130
So if I click on that,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.100
I can place a marker here,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.780
for example here.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.900
And I can write a common.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.780
For example,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.890
where is the c t A.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.310
Which is called to action.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.000
Okay,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.850
I can post it.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.180
I can even mention someone here like at you.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.080
I design and this person will get an email about this comment and he can reply to me.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.560
Okay,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.510
So done.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.440
And in these accounts,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.120
you can see that there is a comment.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.590
So I click on that are right.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.720
Where is the city?

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.210
A.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.360
I can reply.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.410
I will design it Point tonight.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.920
You can also add an emoji here.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.650
Pretty cool reply.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.750
That's awesome.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.600
And here in my account,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.700
I can see the reply immediately,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.240
which is pretty fantastic.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.460
And if this problem has been solved,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.360
you can click and resolve bottom and this comment will be removed.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.350
So as you can see,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.170
figure offers you plenty of features in order to collaborate with other designers without

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.060
exporting your files and sending them and all those stuff so you can instantly cooperate

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.250
with others and share your ideas about your design are right,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.620
guys,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.310
that's all for these video.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.980
I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.
