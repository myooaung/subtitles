00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.290
Hi,

00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.870
everyone,

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.640
and welcome back to another reedy off this course in this video,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.070
I'm going to show you how you can create an account on Fig MMA in order to use that for our

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.820
projects.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.320
As I mentioned before,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.170
Fig MMA is free to use.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.960
However,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.150
if you want to create more than three projects,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.780
you need to get the professional account,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.280
which is not necessary for this course.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.710
But the good news is,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.750
if your students and your enrolled in a university or a school,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.950
you could always create a figment,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.310
account for a student and verify your student status and use it for free.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.540
That is fantastic.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.250
But if you are not a student,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.450
there is no problem.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.390
You can still use all the features off Sigma with the free account,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.910
and you can seal create unlimited pages and files.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.910
So how can you create an account?

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.200
It's so simple.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.260
If you open up the Figment website,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.430
which is Fatemeh dot com,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.180
you can click and sign up,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.800
and here you could choose whether you want to sign up with Google account or with your

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.850
email address and setting a new passport to your account.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.100
It's totally up to you.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.610
You can also log into your account with your Google account or with your email and password

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.480
that you said.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.270
So let me log in with my ankle yell accounts.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.200
There we go.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.010
And as you can see,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.810
whenever you create an account,

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.310
you have already some projects here,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.170
which is called Feed My Basics prototyping in fig,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.670
MMA and wire framing in fig MMA.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.790
And if I open up this one,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.100
you could see some simple tutorials and some basics about fig MMA and how you could use

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.500
that.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.230
You don't need to worry about it because we're going to cover all aspects of fig MMA in the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.750
next series of videos.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.530
Our right.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.500
As you can see on your left,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.800
you have some menus.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.970
The 1st 1 is your account or your profile.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.580
If you click on that,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.340
you can see it's your name.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.270
You can change your profile image,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.710
and here there are some options personal access tokens,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.850
and we don't need to use that for now.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.650
And if you want to delete your account,

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.850
can use this option,

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.600
the next option is search.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.870
You can search through your projects and your files,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.430
then you have recent,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.350
which shows you the recent projects and files that you have opened.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.120
And then we have plug ins,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.220
which gives you the option of installing some plug ins,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.540
which is so important,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.460
and we'll talk about it later.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.220
And then we have drafts.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.080
You can create some drafts and also you have deleted files.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.610
Okay,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.090
You can also create a new team over there if you want a work in a team,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.300
and also you could import your sketch file.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.150
It's amazing and figure out automatically converts your sketch file to figure five,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.950
and you could use it perfectly.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.510
Right now,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.210
we're using Sigma on our browser.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.020
However,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.520
as I mentioned before,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.700
you could always install Fatemeh on your system.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.620
So how can you do that?

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.570
It's so simple.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:06.770
If you go ahead to Fichman dot com slash downloads or if I go ahead and log out here is the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.850
landing page and you can see the resource is.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.620
And if you hover on this link,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.380
you could see the downloads link over there.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.840
I'm gonna click on that,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.480
and here we have the Fatemeh downloads,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.380
which lets us download some.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.220
Resource is the 1st 1 is the stump app,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.280
and here you could find the stop act for Mac OS or desk up app for Windows.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.460
So depending on your operating system,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.350
you could download it and install it.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.000
Okay,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.500
then we have a live device preview.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.430
It's a great application.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.790
You could download it from APP store or Google play,

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.030
and then you could preview your design instantly.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.480
And last but not least,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.870
we have font installers.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.020
What's that when you're using feet Ma on your browser,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.450
FEMA cannot get access to your local funds,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.450
which is not good,

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.720
because most of the time you need to use your local funds.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.810
So in order to fix that problem,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.070
you could download the fund installer for Windows or Mac OS.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.500
Then you could install it.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.260
And after that you can get access to your local funds on your browser,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.490
which is pretty awesome.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.420
Although you could get access to your local funds by installing the's font installer,

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.690
I highly recommend that he used the desktop version of Stigma because it's really

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.670
accelerates.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.520
Your design process are right,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.900
guys,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.330
thank you so much for watching this video.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.940
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.550
And in the next video I'm going to talk about the environment,

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.200
up stigma and how you could use it simply.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.380
So see you then.
