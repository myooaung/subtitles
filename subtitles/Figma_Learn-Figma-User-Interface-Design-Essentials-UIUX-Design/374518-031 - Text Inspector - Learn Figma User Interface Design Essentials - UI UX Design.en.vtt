00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.350
Hi,

00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:00.950
everyone.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.360
I hope you're doing well.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.410
And welcome back to another video of thes course in these video.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.030
We're gonna be talking about the Texans,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.740
Specter.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.530
Okay,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.790
how you can customize your text.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.900
So without further ado,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.410
let's get it started.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.210
We'd selecting these text and in the tax Inspector,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.730
we have different options.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.930
As I mentioned before,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.830
some off them,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.150
I'm going to review them.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.780
The first option is the font that you can easily get access to your local funds or the

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.760
figment funds.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.190
Okay,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.500
we can easily change your funds.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.150
And now I'm gonna set it bank to Monserrate.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.990
An exception is the weight of your front.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.250
You can modify Teoh Athene light,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.570
regular,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510
bold and black.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.170
However,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.570
keep in mind that these options may be different for different funds.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.070
Okay,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.080
so I'm going to set it to regular,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.800
and the next property is the fun size.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.880
As you can see,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.110
you can change your fund size easily,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.710
so I'm going to change it to 68.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.790
You can also do mathematical operations here.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.470
I'm going to divide it by two.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.440
Pretty awesome.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.550
Then we have the line height,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.910
which is so important when you're designing a user interface in terms of visibility,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.460
of your lines in different screen size.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.190
As you can see,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.140
it has been set to auto.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.490
Fatemeh calculates the line height by percentage.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.000
Okay,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.830
it's based on your fund size.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.450
So if you want to declare your own line height in peak cell,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.930
you can easily right for example,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.480
80 pixel like this.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.350
And now these values based on pixels,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.990
not percentage anymore like this.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.010
The next property is letters facing which determines the spacing between your letters like

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.560
this.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.050
And then we have paragraph spacing.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.700
We cannot see the changes here because we have created only bond paragraph.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.990
So I'm gonna make this fun size a little bit smaller that set it to 24.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.430
And I'm going to change the line.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.100
Hi to photo.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.770
And let's add one more paragraph to eat.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.980
So I'm going to write.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.800
We are talking about properties like this.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.540
So now if you change the paragraph,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.430
spacing can see that it changes immediately,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.500
and then we have the paragraph indentation.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.370
And if I increase this,

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.420
you can see that you can specify this amount and it will add some white space before the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.140
first word of each paragraph are right.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.670
I'm gonna undo this pretty good.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.560
And here we have the horizontal alignments.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.550
We have takes a line to left,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.180
takes a line to center and takes a line to write.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.010
And after that,

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.760
we have the vertical alignment.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.720
As you can see,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.500
I can change it as well.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.060
However,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.350
keep in mind that this option is only applicability to affix sized text layer.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.390
As you can see,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.800
we can apply these changes because we're using a fixed size text layer.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.460
But if I create another text here Hello,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.810
I am testing it now.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.950
If I changed a vertical alignment,

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.130
nothing happens.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.650
Okay?

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.340
You have also some advanced properties that you can get access to by clicking on these

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.290
three dots.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.120
Here you have the preview section that you can preview each operation whenever you hover

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.380
your mouse on top of these options.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.120
So the 1st 1 is re sizing and I have explained you in the previous video you have three

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.470
different options grow to resent Aly grow vertically and fixed size text layer.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.950
Then you have alignment like this.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.670
And after that you have decoration.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.580
As you can see,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.020
it's said to non so we don't have any decoration.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.580
However,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.860
you can choose underline or strike through like this.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.630
After that,

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.030
we have the letter case.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.840
You can specify which kind of leather case you want to use.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.560
For example,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.480
these fun is upper case.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.970
We have lower case.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.570
So if I choose uppercase,

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.250
all of my letters become offer case.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.780
Okay,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.150
If I choose lower case as you can see,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.990
the changes apply immediately.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.810
And then we have title case.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.570
We have small camps and four small caps.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.440
Pretty awesome.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.780
We have also case sensitive forms.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.470
However,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.060
it's not applicable for these selected text,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.300
so we're gonna live it for now.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.900
Then we have numbers,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.930
so we cannot see the changes here because we're not using any number in our text.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.100
But you can preview them.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.430
Here are right.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.620
You can even choose the fraction.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.220
It's totally about numbers and these are so advanced.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.000
And most of the time we don't use them in our design process.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.530
Are right,

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.930
guys,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.710
that's all for these video.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.480
Thank you so much for watching it.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.050
And I will see you in the next video.
