00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530
Hi,

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.370
everyone In these video,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.630
we're gonna be talking about selection controls.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.230
Selection controls allow users to easily select between different options.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.950
It's useful for declaring preferences such a settings.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.640
When you're designing a selection control,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.350
make sure to pay attention to the following points.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.550
Number one Familiarity.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.370
Selection controls have been used in you.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.660
I design for a long time and should be utilized as expected.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.810
Number two efficiency selection controls let users easily compare two or more options.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.620
And last but not least,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.870
scannable selection controls should be appear in a way that users can recognize them at a

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.640
glance.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.440
Selected items should be visually distinguishable from one selected items.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.200
As you can see on the right side of the screen,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.900
we have three different selection controls.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.160
The 1st 1 is speeches.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.330
It's useful for targeting a single option on or off,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.800
and it is so popular.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.070
The next month is radio buttons.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.780
They are useful for selecting a single option from a least,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.790
and the last one is check parts,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.120
and it's useful for selecting born or multiple items from a least,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.950
so make sure to use them in the right way.
