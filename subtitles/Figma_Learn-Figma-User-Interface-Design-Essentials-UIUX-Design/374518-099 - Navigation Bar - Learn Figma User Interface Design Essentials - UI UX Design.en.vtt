00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.815
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:03.975
Now that's our wireframe is ready.

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:06.885
We are going to start designing our landing page together.

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:08.610
Are you ready? Let's go.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.605
First of all, I'm going to create another art board right next to my wireframe.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:16.485
Okay, so I'm going to press a key on my keyboard,

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:17.925
and then on the right side,

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:19.620
I'm going to choose desktop.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.415
Perfect.

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:23.100
Let me move it up and I'm going to zoom in.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.740
Now let me rename it to landing page.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.935
Make sure to name your layers and your art boards

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:32.235
properly in order to keep your project organized.

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:36.420
Alright, now let me make it a little bit longer, like this.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.575
It's enough for now.

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:40.480
Alright, so what do we need for our landing page?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.120
As you can see, we have a wireframe that we created in

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.110
the previous video and we know where the elements are going to be placed.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.060
However, for this landing page,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.850
we need to create a layout greed first in order

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.419
to guide us where we should put our elements.

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:59.915
Okay, while these landing page aren't word is selected,

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:02.660
head over to the layout grid on the right side in

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.245
the inspector and click on this plus icon. Okay, there we go.

00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:07.625
Now we have agreed,

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:10.955
but if you click on this icon right next to this tags,

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:14.075
you can modify this greed two columns,

00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:17.374
okay, and this is exactly what we want for this project.

00:01:17.374 --> 00:01:19.640
We're going to use a twelv column layout grid,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.665
okay, which is a popular one.

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.650
I'm going to set the count to 12. There we go.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.270
Now we have 12 columns and then the type is going to be stretch.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.750
You can set it to center and set the width,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.195
but I prefer to set it to stretch.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:41.990
And I'm gonna give it a margin of 150 pixels from the right side and from the left side.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.465
And then let's change the gutter amount,

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:46.924
which is the whitespace between our columns.

00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:49.295
Okay, I'm gonna set it to 16.

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:54.575
Alright, so now our layout greed is ready and we could start designing our landing page.

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:55.670
So what do we need?

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.840
First of all, we need to design our navigation bar at the top.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.140
Okay, our navigation bar is going to have a logo,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.955
then some menu items,

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:06.515
and finally a button.

00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:09.650
So please open up the assets folder that you downloaded

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.820
before because we're going to need the logo that we already prepared for you.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.545
And from the logo folder,

00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:21.095
please drag-and-drop the logo dot SVG file to your project like this.

00:02:21.095 --> 00:02:21.845
Fantastic.

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:23.855
If you want to hide your layout grid,

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:26.930
you can easily press Control G on

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.890
your keyboard and you can press it again to target it are perfect.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.860
I'm going to zoom in a little bit and I'm going to align

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.235
these logo to the left side of this column.

00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:40.280
The second column, we're not gonna put our elements in

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.430
the first column from the left and from the right.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.580
Okay, so we're going to leave them empty, pretty good.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.440
Then we need to have some menu items.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.570
Okay, I'm going to press T on my keyboard and click here to create a text layer.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.015
And then let me write, for example,

00:02:56.015 --> 00:02:58.670
home as our first menu item.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.700
And now we could start using our text size.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.315
Okay, so if I head over to the text section in the Inspector,

00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:08.435
I can click on the style icon on the right side,

00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:12.515
and then I'm going to choose Medium 17, okay.

00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:16.025
So this is the textile that we created before.

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:16.730
There we go.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.545
I'm gonna move it a little bit up.

00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:24.440
Let me zoom in and duplicated by pressing Command Z or Control D.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.380
If you're using Windows and move it to the right side

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.395
and let me change it to features. Perfect.

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:32.465
Once again, I'm gonna duplicate it,

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:34.145
Command Z or Control D.

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:38.164
Move it to the right side and let me write pricing.

00:03:38.164 --> 00:03:41.675
So now we have our three menu items, okay?

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:45.110
But I'm gonna do is select these three items

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.085
and I'm going to press shift and a to add the auto-layout to it.

00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:51.230
And as you can see on the right side,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.450
we have an auto-layout added.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.770
So from now on,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.590
we could modify the spacing between these elements using the section like this, okay?

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.045
And if you want to, for example,

00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:03.485
add a new item,

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:07.010
we just need to select one of them and press Command D.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.195
And as you can see,

00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:12.170
these frame that we just created will grow horizontally

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.520
automatically because we are using a horizontal auto-layout, right?

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.460
If we change the mode from horizontal to vertical,

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.649
you can see that the stack vertically,

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.035
but we wanna keep it horizontal like this.

00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:25.745
Let me remove these features.

00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:26.405
Pretty good.

00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:30.275
Alright, I'm gonna set the spacing between them to 70,

00:04:30.275 --> 00:04:31.550
like this for now.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.430
And then let me align it to the center,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.795
are essentially using the Alignments section in the inspector like this,

00:04:38.795 --> 00:04:41.870
the last thing we need for our navigation bar is a button.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.920
Ok, so what I'm gonna do is select the rectangle tool

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.195
from the toolbar and click and drag to create a rectangle like this.

00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:54.065
And I'm going to increase the corner radius to 20 to make it rounded.

00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:56.390
Hey, let me zoom in and I'm going to hide

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.575
my layout grid to see are elements a little bit better,

00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:03.770
alright, so let me change the width two,

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.735
for example, 167 instead of 177.

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:12.650
And I'm going to set the high 256 for now, okay,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.135
now for this button,

00:05:14.135 --> 00:05:17.825
I'm going to use one of our colors styles that ve already created.

00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:20.090
So if I head over to the field section on

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.360
the right side and I click on these four dots icon,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.220
I can choose the accent color.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.515
There we go. Alright, for this button,

00:05:27.515 --> 00:05:29.135
I'm gonna need a text.

00:05:29.135 --> 00:05:33.530
So let me press T on my keyboard and click here to create a text layer.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.405
And I'm going to write sign up.

00:05:35.405 --> 00:05:40.475
Pretty good since we used a textile before for our menu items,

00:05:40.475 --> 00:05:46.460
fema will automatically choose the same textile as our default text style, okay,

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.305
when we create a new text layer,

00:05:48.305 --> 00:05:49.415
and it's totally fine,

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:53.015
then I'm going to set the color to white like this.

00:05:53.015 --> 00:05:55.550
And finally, we need to align our elements here.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.015
So if you zoom in a little bit that you could see it better.

00:05:59.015 --> 00:06:01.805
As you can see, my text is selected.

00:06:01.805 --> 00:06:06.620
I'm gonna hold down the Shift key and click on our rectangle like this.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.275
And now, if you take a look at the layers list,

00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:12.500
we can see that two layers are selected at the same time.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.285
And this is exactly what we want.

00:06:14.285 --> 00:06:19.280
And now let me align them both horizontally and vertically, like this.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.420
One more thing here,

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.170
we could create a group or we could add an Auto Layout to them.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.490
And I prefer the ladder.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.860
So let me press shift on a,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.020
and now this button is dynamic.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.175
What do I mean by that?

00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:33.080
Since it's set to horizontal,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.120
if I try to add some text so it,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.205
it's gonna grow horizontally.

00:06:37.205 --> 00:06:38.375
So let's give it a try.

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:39.455
I'm going to change,

00:06:39.455 --> 00:06:43.325
sign up to something like registration.

00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:46.205
Alright, can you see how it grows horizontally?

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:47.180
It's perfect.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.370
So our button is ready as well.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.405
What else should we do?

00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:55.085
We need to align all these three elements vertically, okay,

00:06:55.085 --> 00:06:57.980
so I'm gonna select all of them holding down the Shift key

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.204
and I'm going to press aligned vertical center.

00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:02.750
But we have one more problem.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.225
So let me unhide my layout grid.

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:08.600
What I'm gonna do is move this button to

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.230
the right side to touch the right side of my second column.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.350
Okay, like this, and now I think it looks fine.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.930
However, we could make it a little bit better by

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.975
having the same amount of spacing between

00:07:20.975 --> 00:07:22.895
our logo and a left side of

00:07:22.895 --> 00:07:27.260
our menu items and our button and the right side of our many items.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.170
And now if I hold down the Alt or Option key on

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.685
my keyboard and hover my mouse on top of the elements around it,

00:07:34.685 --> 00:07:36.995
I can see the amount of margin and padding.

00:07:36.995 --> 00:07:42.770
On the right side I have 154 and on the left side I have 274.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.860
So let me move it to the left side a little bit.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.150
All right, now as you can see,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:53.135
I have 214 pixels from the left and 214 pixels from the Right.

00:07:53.135 --> 00:07:53.750
Okay?

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.080
So this frame is exactly in the middle of

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.205
these two elements and it's exactly the result I was looking for.

00:08:01.205 --> 00:08:02.585
Last but not least,

00:08:02.585 --> 00:08:04.145
let's select all of them,

00:08:04.145 --> 00:08:08.150
grouped them, hit Command Z or Control G on your keyboard.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.940
And I am going to call it a nav bar.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.500
Alright, as you can see,

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.990
it's top margin is set to 79.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.810
I'm gonna set it to AD so I can move it

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.320
down by the arrow key on my keyboard by one pixel.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:21.995
Perfect.

00:08:21.995 --> 00:08:24.170
All right guys, that's all for this video,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.485
we have successfully created our navigation bar,

00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:31.130
and in the next video we will start designing our hero section together.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.970
So see you then.
