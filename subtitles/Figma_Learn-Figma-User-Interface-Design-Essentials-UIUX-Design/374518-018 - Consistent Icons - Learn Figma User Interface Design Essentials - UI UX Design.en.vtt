00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.440
Hello,

00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:00.890
everyone.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.160
In this video,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.950
we're gonna be talking about icons in design.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.010
You may think that working with icons is an easy part of the U.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.750
I design.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.840
However,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.250
if you do not pay attention to details,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.990
you will not get appropriate.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.450
Result your some important points that you need to take care off.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.150
Number one.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.630
Test the scalability.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.480
Check if you're icons can still be recognized at small sizes such as 15 by 15 pixels.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.610
Number two properly sized there.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.410
Commended Target size for touch screen objects is 7 to 10 millimeters.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.340
Also remember to add padding between icons to preventing correct taps.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.450
Number three Internal consistency.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.730
Use the same color scheme for all icons and also the same styling attributes such as the

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.160
size of borders.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.460
Number four.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.970
Perfect alignment.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.140
Always try to have perfect alignment in a con.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.250
Ah,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.800
graffiti.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.610
But sometimes because you have icons with different sizes,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.890
you need to balance them by yourself.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.310
If you look at the picture on your right,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.980
you can see that we have two different groups off icons in the left group.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.870
You can see that we have consistent iconography because we only use outline icons.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.120
But on the other hand,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.690
we have inconsistent iconography because we use both outline and solid icons at the same

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.150
time,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.780
which is not true commanded.
