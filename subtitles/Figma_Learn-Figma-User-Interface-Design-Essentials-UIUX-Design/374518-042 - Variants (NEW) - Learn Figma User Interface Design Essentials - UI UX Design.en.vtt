00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.985
Hey, welcome back. In this video,

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:08.355
we are going to be talking about a new cool feature that has been added to fema recently,

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:10.410
and it's called variants.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.525
Alright, what does this feature do?

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:14.175
Let me show you an example.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:15.900
Let's suppose we have a button, ok,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.990
so I'm gonna go ahead and create a button quickly.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.845
So let me select the Rectangle and just click and drag to create this rectangle.

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:32.150
And I'm going to change the height to 44 pixels and a width to 100.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.290
Like this.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.420
Let me zoom mean, perfect.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.165
And then I'm gonna make it rounded,

00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:41.300
so increase the corner radius to five.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.470
Fantastic.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.730
And finally, let me change the color to purple, like this predicted.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.220
Now for this button we need a text layer.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.855
So I'm going to press T on my keyboard and click to create a new layer.

00:00:56.855 --> 00:00:58.295
And let's write button.

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:02.615
Then I'm going to change its color to white, like this.

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:05.330
And it's fun, size is going to be 14.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.900
Then I'm gonna select both these layers and align them horizontally and vertically.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.815
That's good.

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:17.075
Once again, select both of them and I'm going to add the auto-layout to them.

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:20.345
So hit shift an a on your keyword like this.

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:24.320
So now we've just created a simple Walton which is dynamic,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.065
okay, like this, as I showed you before,

00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:30.530
you can create a component out of this button, okay,

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.325
like this, you could just create a component and it's totally fine.

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:37.520
But let's suppose we have different states of this button.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.115
Ok, so let me duplicate it.

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:41.810
Command Z or Control D.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.165
I'm gonna move it down for the first one,

00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:47.945
I'm going to rename it to button forward slash,

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:53.555
primary, forward slash default. Like this.

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:57.200
And this second one is an instance of this components.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.750
So first I'm going to detach it.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.400
So I'm going to click on this 3.The icon and click on detach incense.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.920
Okay, so now I'm gonna change its name to button slash, primary slash hover.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.120
Okay, so this is the hover state of this button like this.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.140
And then I'm going to add another field to the field section,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.850
which is an overlay layer.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.670
And I'm going to change it from linear to solid.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.770
Its wide. That's perfect.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.840
And let me decrease the capacity from 100%, 2, 10%.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.920
Fantastic.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.725
Alright, remember to create a component.

00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:38.660
There we go. We have the second button.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.685
And if I go to the assets tab,

00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:42.455
you can see that we have two buttons.

00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:44.030
Okay, so far, so good.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.800
Let me create one more button and then we will jump into using variants.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.720
Okay, I'm gonna duplicate it,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.590
will be down detached from its master component and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.745
I'm going to rename it to button primary pressed.

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:05.390
Okay, and this time I'm gonna change the color of our overlay feel and instead of y,

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.325
I am going to use lac, okay?

00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:11.075
And let me increase the opacity to 20%

00:03:11.075 --> 00:03:15.275
Right now let me create a component and we are done.

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:17.000
So let's suppose that we are working on

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.420
a project and you want to use one of these buttons, okay?

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.880
So if you go to the assets tab and you could drag and drop button primary, ok.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.520
And if you needed the hover state,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.635
you could swap the instance here to hover pressed and anything else.

00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:36.260
But now you could use variance, okay,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.515
which is a very cool way of organizing your components into a single component.

00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:44.150
Let me show you how it works.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.850
So right now we have three different components.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.740
But what if we could combine these components into a single component?

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.225
And it's so simple to do,

00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:55.535
just select all your components,

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.335
all these three components.

00:03:57.335 --> 00:03:58.730
And in the inspector,

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.335
you could find variance,

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:03.230
OK. Click and combine as variance.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.905
There we go.

00:04:03.905 --> 00:04:05.090
So as you can see,

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.655
a new frame has been created here,

00:04:07.655 --> 00:04:09.500
and we call it a components set.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.380
So it is indicated with this dashed border.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.270
And the cool thing is that you could customize the appearance of these components.

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:23.975
Said you could modify the color of border like this according to your brands colors,

00:04:23.975 --> 00:04:27.140
and you could basically stylists however you want,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.900
but for now I'm going to leave it as is.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.735
Alright, so let me select my components set.

00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:34.070
And on the right side,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.235
you can see under the variance section,

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.740
we have two different properties.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.515
Property one, property two, okay?

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:47.090
So the property one is basically the type of our button in this case,

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.770
you could name it whatever you want.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.405
But for now, I'm gonna go ahead and write type because it makes sense.

00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:55.085
But what about the second property?

00:04:55.085 --> 00:04:57.815
The second property is basically the state's.

00:04:57.815 --> 00:05:00.560
So I'm going to write state like this.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.110
And now if I go to the assets that you can see that we have only one component,

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.520
okay, which is button,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.610
and I can drag and drop it into my Canvas.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.440
And on the right side you can see that we have type and state, okay,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.575
for the type, since we have only one button type,

00:05:18.575 --> 00:05:21.125
which is primary, we don't need to change it.

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:22.370
But for the state,

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.020
we can change it to hover.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.395
We can change it to pressed like this.

00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:29.465
That's so simple, isn't it?

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:33.125
This is what we call one-dimensional variance, OK?

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:38.315
Because we have basically different components here with the same properties,

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:40.925
however, with different values.

00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:41.465
Okay?

00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:47.030
So in general we have one-dimensional variants and multidimensional variants. Okay?

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.305
And I'm going to show you how you can create multidimensional variants as well.

00:05:51.305 --> 00:05:55.235
So don't worry, before jumping into multidimensional variance,

00:05:55.235 --> 00:05:58.025
let me give you two more examples here.

00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:01.624
Let's suppose you want to create a switch

00:06:01.624 --> 00:06:05.255
that has actually two different sites on and off.

00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:09.140
Okay, so let's go ahead and quickly create a sushi together for ASU

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.325
each we need to create a rectangle like this.

00:06:13.325 --> 00:06:19.355
I'm going to set the width to 60 and the height to 30, like this.

00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:24.530
And then I'm gonna make it rounded completely since it's a switch.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.260
And let me change the color to white.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.385
Fantastic.

00:06:28.385 --> 00:06:30.710
Now I'm gonna duplicate it.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.610
So hit command D or control the on your keyboard.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.660
And then I'm going to decrease the width of this new layer,

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.015
this duplicated layer 230,

00:06:41.015 --> 00:06:43.940
so that I get a 30 by 30 pixels circle.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.750
And then I'm gonna move it to the right side like this.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.155
And you could change its color to green.

00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:53.465
I'm gonna change it to this green.

00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:54.215
Perfect.

00:06:54.215 --> 00:06:57.170
Finally, I'm gonna scale it down a little bit.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:03.260
So hold down the Shift and Option key together or Shift and Alt key and

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:09.905
tried to scale it down like this until you get a 24 by 24 pixels circle.

00:07:09.905 --> 00:07:10.729
Fantastic.

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:12.605
So let me go to layers,

00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:14.660
and now I'm going to group them.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.935
Let me rename it to switch slash on.

00:07:18.935 --> 00:07:20.360
Then I'm gonna duplicate it.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.090
Command your control D will be down,

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.080
and I'm going to double-click on this green circle to select.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.990
It will be to the left side, okay?

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.605
Make sure to maintain the same padding here, okay,

00:07:33.605 --> 00:07:38.435
here we have a three pixel padding for top, right and bottom.

00:07:38.435 --> 00:07:39.050
Okay?

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.610
And if you wanna see the padding,

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.280
you can hold down the Option or Alt key on

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.045
your keyboard and hover on your element like that.

00:07:47.045 --> 00:07:50.015
And then here we have 333.

00:07:50.015 --> 00:07:50.975
That's perfect.

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:52.445
And last but not least,

00:07:52.445 --> 00:07:56.570
we need to change the color from green to gray,

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.890
OK, to indicate that this switch is turned off.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:06.095
And finally, let me rename it to sue each off.

00:08:06.095 --> 00:08:08.705
And then I'm going to select both of them.

00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:10.340
And in the toolbar,

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.740
instead of clicking on this button,

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.010
I'm going to click on this arrow icon to open up

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.615
this drop menu and click on create multiple components.

00:08:20.615 --> 00:08:23.030
Let me show you what happens if you click on this button.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.200
If you click on this,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.590
you will create a single component which is not correct.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.775
I'm gonna hit Command Z or Control Z to undo the process.

00:08:31.775 --> 00:08:34.985
And let me create multiple components.

00:08:34.985 --> 00:08:38.345
There we go. Right now we have two different switches,

00:08:38.345 --> 00:08:40.055
switch on, switch off.

00:08:40.055 --> 00:08:42.830
And if I head over to the assets tab,

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.055
you can see that we have two different components.

00:08:46.055 --> 00:08:47.315
Okay, that's fine.

00:08:47.315 --> 00:08:50.479
But we are gonna take it to another step by using variants.

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:56.075
So what we need to do is select both of them and combine them as variance.

00:08:56.075 --> 00:09:02.390
There we go. And now I'm gonna change the property name here to switch.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.590
And since we used off and on in the name of these switches,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.050
if you try to add an instance here,

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.530
you could see that we don't have that drop menu anymore.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.040
We have these cool Switch feature like this,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.170
and it feels really good.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.065
Let me select my switch components said,

00:09:21.065 --> 00:09:24.620
and try to rename this off to,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.269
for example, disable and is on to enable.

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:33.110
Okay, and now we don't have that functionality anymore.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.505
We have this drop menu.

00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:35.930
It works perfectly.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.345
However, using this cool feature,

00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:39.995
you could make it even better.

00:09:39.995 --> 00:09:44.585
So I'm going to write off here and on here.

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:47.315
You could use true and false as well, okay?

00:09:47.315 --> 00:09:48.860
And also you could.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.110
Modify their position like this.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.110
You could click and drag to change her position page.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.945
So I'm going to put on in the first place,

00:09:56.945 --> 00:10:00.545
let me show you how you could use true and false, OK,

00:10:00.545 --> 00:10:05.435
right, I'm going to rename it to false and you will get the same functionality.

00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:06.469
Perfect.

00:10:06.469 --> 00:10:09.185
Can you see how amazing these variants are?

00:10:09.185 --> 00:10:12.635
Alright, this was another one-dimensional example.

00:10:12.635 --> 00:10:15.755
I'm gonna show you one more example and then we will jump

00:10:15.755 --> 00:10:19.115
into creating multidimensional variance.

00:10:19.115 --> 00:10:22.730
Okay, the next example is going to be a radio button.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.205
So what do we need for radio button?

00:10:25.205 --> 00:10:29.555
Obviously, we need a circle you could press on your keyboard as well.

00:10:29.555 --> 00:10:31.010
Hold down the Shift key,

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.190
click and drag to create a circle.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.905
I'm going to set the width and height 230.

00:10:36.905 --> 00:10:38.870
So it's totally fine right now.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.915
And let's change the color to white.

00:10:41.915 --> 00:10:44.030
Okay, then I'm gonna duplicate it.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.940
Hit Command Z or Control D on your keyboard.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.030
Hold down the Shift and Alt key or Shift and Option

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.660
key and try to scale it down like this.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.045
Ok, so for the inner circle,

00:10:56.045 --> 00:11:00.740
we're going to have an 18 by 18 pixels circle like this.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.835
And I'm gonna change the color to this purple like this.

00:11:04.835 --> 00:11:06.290
Okay, let me head over to

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.740
the layers tab and I'm going to select both of them, grouped them,

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.905
hit Command Z or Control Z on your keyboard,

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:18.245
and let me rename it to radio button slash on.

00:11:18.245 --> 00:11:21.020
Okay, I'm gonna duplicate it will be to

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:26.105
the right side and double-click on this inner circle, remove it,

00:11:26.105 --> 00:11:31.235
and let's rename the group to radio button, slash off,

00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:32.765
select both of them,

00:11:32.765 --> 00:11:36.815
create multiple components like this.

00:11:36.815 --> 00:11:42.890
And then while these two components are selected, keychain combiners variance.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.670
There we go.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:48.875
And now let me go to the assets tab drag-and-drop radio button.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:50.570
We have property one.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:51.920
We didn't rename it.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.600
So if you wanna rename it,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.555
you should make sure to select your components set,

00:11:56.555 --> 00:11:58.654
not your component itself,

00:11:58.654 --> 00:12:01.205
your components set, which is radio button.

00:12:01.205 --> 00:12:04.100
And here you can double-click on this property one,

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.425
and let's write state.

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:07.850
There we go.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.605
And now we have state.

00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:15.095
It's pretty good, isn't it are right now let's talk about multidimensional variance.

00:12:15.095 --> 00:12:16.490
Ok, so first of all,

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:21.935
I'm going to go ahead and create a new page here to organize our components. Okay?

00:12:21.935 --> 00:12:24.635
So this is our page one.

00:12:24.635 --> 00:12:30.695
I'm going to rename it to one dimensional like this.

00:12:30.695 --> 00:12:35.630
And I'm going to create a new page by clicking on this plus icon.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.245
And let me write multi dimensional.

00:12:39.245 --> 00:12:43.250
Perfect, alright, right, let me move back to one-dimensional and I'm

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:47.450
gonna select this button components set copied commands,

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:51.680
your control C, go to multidimensional page and paste it,

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.855
hit Command Z or Control V.

00:12:53.855 --> 00:12:56.990
Okay, alright, so what are we going to do here?

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.530
First of all, I'm going to go ahead and enlarge this frame.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.935
Okay?

00:13:00.935 --> 00:13:06.245
So I'm going to enlarge it like this so that we have more space to work with.

00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:08.825
And then I'm going to organize these buttons.

00:13:08.825 --> 00:13:13.235
So I'm gonna move it to the first row for this one as well. So we have.

00:13:13.235 --> 00:13:17.345
One button with three different states like this.

00:13:17.345 --> 00:13:19.535
Let me make these frames smaller.

00:13:19.535 --> 00:13:21.110
Alright, first of all,

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:26.240
I'm going to move these components out of this components set, okay?

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.340
So we don't have variants anymore.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.480
If you go to assets and if you go to multidimensional,

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.015
we have three different components, okay?

00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:38.120
Which means that we are not using variance anymore.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.569
And now we need to rename these buttons.

00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:42.785
How can we do that?

00:13:42.785 --> 00:13:48.365
I'm going to select all of them and I'm going to hit Command or Control on my keyboard.

00:13:48.365 --> 00:13:50.554
And here using this window,

00:13:50.554 --> 00:13:52.745
I can rename all my layers,

00:13:52.745 --> 00:13:56.780
all my components at the same time with cool functionalities.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.595
So I'm gonna head over to this,

00:13:58.595 --> 00:14:02.660
rename to field and let me click on this current Name button.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.300
Okay, this wave we are getting the current name of

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.690
our layer and then we can add more texture to it.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:14.254
So I'm gonna write a slash and then we doubt icon,

00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:17.540
perfect and click and rename their Vigo.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.620
We've just changed the name of all our buttons. That's amazing.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.375
Now I'm gonna duplicate them.

00:14:23.375 --> 00:14:26.225
Command your control D over them down.

00:14:26.225 --> 00:14:30.260
And these are the instances of our master components.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.015
So as you know,

00:14:32.015 --> 00:14:35.660
we need to detach them from their master components.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.570
And once again, I'm gonna go ahead and rename them.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.600
So hit Command or Control R.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.610
And here in the match field,

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.585
I'm going to write, we doubt i Context.

00:14:47.585 --> 00:14:51.995
Okay, make sure to write it exactly the same way you wrote it before.

00:14:51.995 --> 00:14:53.105
It's so important.

00:14:53.105 --> 00:14:56.525
So without icon and then replace it with,

00:14:56.525 --> 00:15:00.230
with icon and hit rename.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.465
Now we've just replace it it easily.

00:15:02.465 --> 00:15:06.289
And then here we are going to add an icon to these buttons.

00:15:06.289 --> 00:15:07.265
How can we do that?

00:15:07.265 --> 00:15:12.470
So simple, I'm gonna go ahead and create a star just for this example.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.290
So let me set the width and hi to

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:20.330
16 pixels and I'm going to change their color to white, fantastic.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.565
And then move it here,

00:15:22.565 --> 00:15:23.795
drag and drop it.

00:15:23.795 --> 00:15:26.855
And as you can see, since we are using auto-layout,

00:15:26.855 --> 00:15:29.255
their with has been changed automatically.

00:15:29.255 --> 00:15:33.950
And this is not what we want because we want to maintain the width of primary button.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.120
Okay, to fix that,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.810
I'm gonna head over to the auto-layout section in the inspector.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.715
And for the horizontal padding,

00:15:40.715 --> 00:15:44.120
I'm gonna write 16 pixels like this.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.815
That's exactly what I need.

00:15:45.815 --> 00:15:48.725
And I'm going to repeat the same process for all my button.

00:15:48.725 --> 00:15:50.765
So I'm going to select my star,

00:15:50.765 --> 00:15:52.835
it command C or control C,

00:15:52.835 --> 00:15:57.095
and select this button and hit Command V or control V to paste it.

00:15:57.095 --> 00:16:02.645
And now I'm going to change your position of these icon from right side to left side.

00:16:02.645 --> 00:16:07.445
So I can use the left arrow key on my keyboard to do it simply.

00:16:07.445 --> 00:16:09.665
And once again, select your button,

00:16:09.665 --> 00:16:12.710
change your horizontal padding, 16.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.360
And last but not least,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.455
I'm going to do the same thing for my last button, okay?

00:16:18.455 --> 00:16:20.435
All right, everything is done.

00:16:20.435 --> 00:16:23.315
Last thing we need to do is create components.

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:28.790
So I'm gonna select these three buttons and create multiple components.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.940
Perfect, now we have six different components, okay?

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.460
And it's time to create variants.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.585
So I'm gonna select all of them and we can combine as variance.

00:16:38.585 --> 00:16:39.410
There we go.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.845
We've just created multidimensional variance, okay?

00:16:42.845 --> 00:16:44.210
And on the right side,

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.580
if we head over to the variants section,

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.350
we can see property one,

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.740
I'm going to write type property to,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.675
I'm going to write state.

00:16:53.675 --> 00:16:57.290
Property three, I'm gonna write icon.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.970
And here we have,

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.605
we'd icon without icon,

00:17:00.605 --> 00:17:02.480
okay, as I mentioned before,

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.080
you could just rename it to on and off,

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.510
okay, to get that toggle feature.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:12.005
And now I can go to the assets multidimensional.

00:17:12.005 --> 00:17:13.820
You could drag and drop it.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.100
And there we go. We have primary,

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.785
we have state like this.

00:17:18.785 --> 00:17:21.800
We have icon or without icon.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.515
That's amazing. So this is basically how a multidimensional variant works, okay?

00:17:27.515 --> 00:17:32.225
But what if we could take it to another step by adding a new type of Martin here.

00:17:32.225 --> 00:17:35.300
So now we have the primary button,

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.865
but we can add a secondary button as well.

00:17:37.865 --> 00:17:39.245
So how can I do that?

00:17:39.245 --> 00:17:40.595
It is so simple.

00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:43.600
First of all, I'm going to select my components set.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.815
Then I'm going to enlarge this border or let's say frame like this.

00:17:48.815 --> 00:17:51.695
And finally I'm going to select all my buttons,

00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:55.355
heats Command Z or Control D, move them down.

00:17:55.355 --> 00:17:57.965
First of all, I'm going to select all of them.

00:17:57.965 --> 00:18:03.020
I mean, these three buttons without icon and let me change their color.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:10.595
So go to selection and colors and try to change the hue like this.

00:18:10.595 --> 00:18:12.095
I think it's good.

00:18:12.095 --> 00:18:15.695
And make sure to grab these hex color code, copy it,

00:18:15.695 --> 00:18:17.945
and select the other three buttons,

00:18:17.945 --> 00:18:19.430
and paste the color here.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.365
Alright, so we are done with the color.

00:18:21.365 --> 00:18:24.320
The only thing left is changed their name.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.460
What should be changed here?

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.145
We need to change the primary keyword,

00:18:28.145 --> 00:18:30.590
okay, to secondary, and we are done.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.080
Basically, I'm going to select all of them.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:33.920
Okay?

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.650
It command R or control are on your keyboard and here in the match takes field,

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.600
I'm going to write primary, ok,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:48.365
so it means get primary and then I'm going to replace it with secondary like this.

00:18:48.365 --> 00:18:51.380
And if I hit rename the or renamed and

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.560
you don't need to do anything else. Let's give it a try.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.250
I'm gonna go to assets and I'm gonna drag and drop this button.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.665
And now instead of primary,

00:19:00.665 --> 00:19:04.340
I'm gonna choose secondary and we have other states.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.340
You could turn on icon like this.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.060
So this is how you could create different types of your button.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:11.585
Okay?

00:19:11.585 --> 00:19:13.730
Alright, let's recap. First.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.840
You need to remember that we have different types of variants,

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.440
one-dimensional variants, and multi-dimensional variance.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:26.495
The second thing you need to remember is that you can use variance for components.

00:19:26.495 --> 00:19:31.640
So you should keep in mind that you need to have components if you want to use variants.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.400
And the last thing you need to remember is that you should try

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.205
to organize your properties very well,

00:19:37.205 --> 00:19:40.400
okay, so if I select these components said Here,

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.920
I have type state icon,

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.095
make sure to name them properly,

00:19:45.095 --> 00:19:48.290
okay, because later on as your project grows,

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.285
you will find it easy to work with.

00:19:50.285 --> 00:19:53.375
The last thing I'm going to mention here is that you could

00:19:53.375 --> 00:19:56.870
actually modify the order of these properties.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.440
So if you hover on this type right next to it,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.510
you can see that an icon appears.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.450
And if I click and drag like this,

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:10.010
I can change the order of these properties, which is so cool.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.485
Okay, so based on the level of importance,

00:20:12.485 --> 00:20:13.805
you could just modify them.

00:20:13.805 --> 00:20:15.710
But in this case, I think type,

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.915
state and icon makes sense,
