00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
Hi,

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.190
everyone.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.310
In these video,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.740
we're gonna be talking about composition in design.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.800
What is the golden ratio?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.780
The golden ratio is a mathematical proportion between the elements of different sizes,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.000
which is thought to be the most aesthetically pleasing proportion for human eyes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.980
The golden ratio equals 1 to 1.618 and it's usually illustrated with seashell shaped its

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.780
piles.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.670
This number was used in creating proportions for architecture,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.680
paintings,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.950
photography,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.760
design,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.800
etcetera.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.800
But how to use the golden ratio in your design?

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.470
If you have a screen with the with off 1200 pixels,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:53.410
you need to divide it by 1.618 and the result will be 741.6.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:02.450
And now we can say 1200 pick songs minus 741 equals to 459.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:11.080
So we have two sections with the with up 741 pixels and 459 pixels.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.860
As you can see on the right side of screening here we have a screen shot off the medium

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.550
website.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.180
Can you see how it has been designed based on the golden ratio so it can get the user's

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.450
attention to the right place at the right time?
