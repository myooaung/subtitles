00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Hi everyone, welcome back.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.930
In this video, we are going to design our last feature section,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.150
okay, which is the support section.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.205
So let me take a look at the wireframe.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:13.290
As you can see on the left side,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.184
we need to have some text layers,

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:18.900
as usual, like our previous sections.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.790
So we need to have a title,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.285
a description, and in addition to these texts layers,

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:27.090
we need to have some profile images, okay,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.145
like this and underwrites side,

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:32.715
we need to design 3D print chat bubbles, okay?

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:37.170
It's going to present how the support team responds to the user's questions,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.565
okay, first of all,

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:43.310
we need to increase the height size of our landing page aren't bored,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.480
so I'm gonna select that and let me increase the height to,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.775
let's say for a 1000,

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.145
for now, later we can modify it.

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:56.645
I'm going to zoom me and what I need is some texts layers.

00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:01.040
So I'm gonna go ahead and double-click on this feature one content,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.775
copy it and let me paste it right here.

00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:06.875
I'm gonna unhide my layout grids.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:10.715
Okay, let me put it to the left side like this,

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:12.920
and the title is going to be,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.980
we support you in five different languages.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.740
Okay, I'm going to copy and paste it from my clipboard like this arrived.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.565
Let me move this description down and make sure that

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:29.570
the top margin is set to 30, like this.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.240
And let me copy and paste the description as well.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.785
It's going to be our support team is here to help you in five languages.

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:41.225
English, French, Spanish, Polish, and German.

00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:42.575
Okay, and at the bottom,

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:44.690
we need to have some profile images.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.875
So to do that,

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:47.945
we need to create a circle.

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:49.580
So I'm gonna click and drag,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.970
and I am going to set the width and height to 60 pixels.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.830
Okay, let me move it down.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.935
For each circle, we need to have an image.

00:01:57.935 --> 00:02:00.290
Before adding the image to our circle,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.450
I'm going to add a stroke feet, okay,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.680
and changed the thickness from one to 1.5 and modify the color to white like this.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.805
Then I'm gonna select that and duplicate these Command or Control D.

00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:15.305
Move it to the right side.

00:02:15.305 --> 00:02:16.970
Once again, duplicate it,

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.265
and two more times, there we go.

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:22.850
So in total, we're going to have five different images.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.744
Now how can we add the image to these circles?

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:27.920
We can select all of them and click on

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.630
this hamburger menu at the top left corner and go to the plugins.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.890
And here I'm gonna go and click on content real plugin.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.920
If you haven't installed the plugin yet,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.320
make sure to click on Manage plugins.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.980
And under left side you can see all the installed plugins.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.245
And if you did an install any plugin,

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:52.970
you can easily go to community and then go to plug-ins tab.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.990
And from here, you can find content real and click on

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.030
Install button on the right side are right wildly circles are selected.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.260
I'm gonna go ahead and run these contents real plug-in our right.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And then at the bottom we have two options,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.824
my content and content library.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.344
I'm gonna go ahead and click on content library,

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:16.085
then go to images.

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:18.500
And here you have plenty of libraries.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.610
You have avatars by Microsoft and some other libraries.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.340
So let me choose avatars by Microsoft,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.355
which includes both male and female pictures.

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:30.230
And I'm going to click on apply all.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.935
There we go.

00:03:30.935 --> 00:03:33.410
So now we have random image as clip to

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.695
our circles and this is exactly the results we were looking for.

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:39.290
However, if you are not happy with the images,

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.300
you can easily click on apply all again to get the best result possible,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.240
make sure to keep a balance so you don't get only male pictures or only female pictures.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.705
Okay?

00:03:50.705 --> 00:03:56.585
Of course it depends on the purpose of your design and the purpose of the product are,

00:03:56.585 --> 00:03:59.390
I think now we have a good result.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.130
I'm going to close the plug-in.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.840
Our images are ready.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.265
You can select all of them,

00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:06.905
grouped them Command Z or Control G.

00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:10.805
And let's call it Profile images, okay,

00:04:10.805 --> 00:04:12.455
right next to these images,

00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:15.020
we need to have a number, okay?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.420
It takes layer, so I'm going to press T on my keyboard and create a new text layer.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.745
And I'm going to write plus 20, ok.

00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:28.159
And it indicates that there are 20 more people working in the support department.

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:31.280
Okay. So I'm gonna move it up a little bit,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.995
make sure that they are aligned vertically.

00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:36.799
Let's set it's left padding to ten,

00:04:36.799 --> 00:04:38.900
and I'm going to choose a textile for it.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.205
So I'm going to choose main and let me change the color.

00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:46.775
Let's use our colors styles, secondary, light.

00:04:46.775 --> 00:04:47.555
There we go.

00:04:47.555 --> 00:04:48.754
It looks amazing.

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:50.570
Alright, the left side is ready.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.055
What about the right side?

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:53.659
As I mentioned before,

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.900
we need to create three different chat bubbles.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.080
Okay, so we need to use the Rectangle tool.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.935
I'm going to select that click and drank like this.

00:05:03.935 --> 00:05:07.910
Make sure to set the width to 370.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.504
And then I'm going to modify the corner radius.

00:05:10.504 --> 00:05:12.994
Let me change it to 30.

00:05:12.994 --> 00:05:17.615
Need to set the corner radius of this particular corner,

00:05:17.615 --> 00:05:20.270
that bottom left corner to 0.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.425
Okay, to do that,

00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:26.990
you can easily head over to the inspector and click on this independent corners icon.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.425
Okay?

00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:31.415
All right, now you can modify the corner radius independently.

00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:33.830
So I'm gonna set the bottom left to 0.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.550
There we go.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.505
And finally, we can change the color to white.

00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:38.060
Okay?

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.985
Alright, now we need to add a profile image right next to this chat bubble.

00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:48.319
Ok, so we need to create a circle like this,

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:49.880
and I'm gonna make it smaller.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.440
So let's set the width and height to 55 pixels will be

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.270
down and make sure that it's aligned with your chat bubble, okay?

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.930
And it's right.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.110
Padding is going to be set to 20 pixels.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.680
Okay?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.630
All right, so let's go ahead and run our content real plugin.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.275
Once again, go to content library images,

00:06:12.275 --> 00:06:13.925
and again choose avatars.

00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:16.940
But this time I'm going to choose a female, okay?

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.974
Because I'm pretty sure that this person needs to be a female.

00:06:20.974 --> 00:06:22.460
So let me choose this one.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.270
Pretty good.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.710
I'm going to close it and we need to add her name and also the timestamp.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.480
So I'm gonna write,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.540
for example, Claire comma 12.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.755
Thirty-five.

00:06:33.755 --> 00:06:35.330
Ok, and for this,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.895
I'm gonna change the text style to caption.

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:39.605
Make sure that it's aligned with

00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:44.105
our chat bubble and its top padding is going to be ten pixels.

00:06:44.105 --> 00:06:49.624
Okay, finally, let me change the color to secondary light.

00:06:49.624 --> 00:06:50.555
Fantastic.

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:53.720
The last thing we need to do is add the message.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.110
So I'm going to add a text layer here and let me write.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.920
Hi Mike, How can I help you a typical support question?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.530
Of course, I'm gonna change the text style to buy the main like this.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.850
Make sure that it's aligned with your chat bubble vertically and

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.200
it's left padding is going to be 40 pixels like this, okay?

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.015
As you can see, the top padding is set to 30 and the bottom padding is set to 29.

00:07:20.015 --> 00:07:22.130
So in order to make it 30,

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.220
I'm going to choose our rectangle or chat bubble.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.195
And let's set the high TO 90 instead of 89.

00:07:29.195 --> 00:07:30.335
Now it looks great.

00:07:30.335 --> 00:07:35.000
Okay, you need to make sure to align your profile image with the rectangle.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.790
Once again also be takes layer should be

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.720
moved by one pixel to get the ten pixel top padding.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.055
Last but not least,

00:07:43.055 --> 00:07:46.340
we need to change its color to secondary light.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.715
Fantastic, our first chat bubble is ready.

00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:52.430
Alright, now let's select these two layers first.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.010
So like this, I'm going to click and drag.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:59.134
And as you can see, our rectangle and this question is selected,

00:07:59.134 --> 00:08:02.930
group them and let's call it chat bubble.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.130
Okay, then select these chat bubble with other elements.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.595
Okay, hold down the Shift key and click on them, grouped them.

00:08:10.595 --> 00:08:14.030
And now let's write message one.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.545
Now I'm gonna duplicate it.

00:08:15.545 --> 00:08:19.580
Command your control D movie down like this.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.915
So the next message is going to be our users message, okay?

00:08:23.915 --> 00:08:27.365
And the direction of these chat bubble should be changed.

00:08:27.365 --> 00:08:29.239
So what I'm gonna do first,

00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:31.550
I'm going to select this rectangle.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.965
So make sure your rectangle is selected,

00:08:33.965 --> 00:08:35.600
not the chat bubble group.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.940
Right-click on that, flip it horizontally so it's direction is changed.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.845
Then I'm going to select this rectangle once again and modify its scholar.

00:08:45.845 --> 00:08:48.425
For this one, I'm gonna set it to

00:08:48.425 --> 00:08:52.595
secondary light and select the question which is this text layer,

00:08:52.595 --> 00:08:55.835
detach it from its style and set it to white.

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:59.000
Then I'm going to double-click on these texts layer will be to

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.740
the right side and make sure that it's aligned with our chat bubble.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.600
And finally, we need to move this profile image to the right side.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.180
Okay, are right, we need to get a 20 peak cell right padding, fantastic.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.265
Now we can move our message to group to the left side.

00:09:19.265 --> 00:09:23.570
I'm going to unhide my layout grids like this are right, pretty good.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.919
Don't forget to change the name and the time I am going to write Mike,

00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:29.315
and for the time,

00:09:29.315 --> 00:09:31.955
let's set it to 1236.

00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:35.720
Align it, you can align it to the right side here as well.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.555
And that takes layer is going to be changed to my credit card is stolen like this.

00:09:41.555 --> 00:09:42.980
And last but not least,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.110
we need to change our picture.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.780
So let's select this circle,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.180
make sure that this layer is selected.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.375
And run the content real plugin once again,

00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:56.315
go to content library, go to Images.

00:09:56.315 --> 00:09:59.270
But this time I'm going to use another library,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.410
for example, this one,

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.060
it doesn't matter which one.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.470
It's totally up to you.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.820
That's let me choose,

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.050
for example, this one.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.090
I think it looks great, perfect,

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.610
alright, our message to Israeli as well.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.514
We need to have one more message.

00:10:12.514 --> 00:10:16.535
And now it's so easy because we need to just select message one,

00:10:16.535 --> 00:10:19.700
duplicate it, command your control D.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.025
Moving down like this,

00:10:22.025 --> 00:10:24.785
make sure to set your spacing correctly.

00:10:24.785 --> 00:10:28.310
So the top margin of this message two is

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.135
going to be 40 pixels like this for this one as well.

00:10:32.135 --> 00:10:34.340
Ok, because consistency is the key,

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.990
InDesign are rife here.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.945
Let's write, okay, no problem,

00:10:38.945 --> 00:10:41.030
we will take care of this.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.520
You can also add an emoji to its,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.470
but we're gonna leave it as is.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:51.455
Okay, so let me decrease its width to 258,

00:10:51.455 --> 00:10:53.405
like this, movie it up.

00:10:53.405 --> 00:10:58.130
And also we need to enlarge this chat bubble because now we have two lines.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.740
Okay, so make sure to select this rectangle.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:06.560
And I'm going to change the height from 90 to 110 to have some space here.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.270
Once again, aligned them,

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:13.730
make sure to move your text layer down and also align this profile image.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.565
Her right, fantastic, everything looks great.

00:11:16.565 --> 00:11:18.694
Now let's select all these messages,

00:11:18.694 --> 00:11:22.505
group them, and let's call it messages, okay?

00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:26.645
And I'm going to select all the contents on the left side,

00:11:26.645 --> 00:11:30.649
group them, and let's write feature three,

00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:35.300
hold down the Shift key and select a message as align them vertically,

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.490
group them, and let's call it feature three section.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.665
All right, we're almost done.

00:11:42.665 --> 00:11:49.730
However, let me move this section three down to get a 260 pixel top margin.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.250
As you can see here, we have empty spaces.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.960
In order to feel these spaces,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.080
we could add some simple shapes to our background.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.285
It doesn't need to be very complicated.

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:02.119
For example, we can add some circles.

00:12:02.119 --> 00:12:04.265
Let me choose the Ellipse tool, okay,

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:05.600
hold down the Shift key,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.105
click and drag to create a circle.

00:12:08.105 --> 00:12:12.830
And let me change the width and height to 16 pixels, okay,

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:17.975
like this, then Let's choose our secondary light color,

00:12:17.975 --> 00:12:19.910
detach it from its style,

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:24.905
and decrease the capacity to 10% to get this light circle,

00:12:24.905 --> 00:12:27.920
then I'm gonna duplicate it over to the right side.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.205
Once again, duplicated command your control Lee,

00:12:31.205 --> 00:12:35.495
and repeat this process till you get six circles in a row.

00:12:35.495 --> 00:12:36.830
Select all of them,

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.785
grouped them, duplicated, movie down,

00:12:39.785 --> 00:12:44.855
make sure that the padding between them and the padding between these rows is the same.

00:12:44.855 --> 00:12:48.455
Ok, so in this case it's set to six pixels.

00:12:48.455 --> 00:12:51.770
And once again, I'm gonna duplicate it, move it down,

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:56.300
and repeat this process till you get six rows like this.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.030
Then I'm going to select all these groups.

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.640
Once again, group them, let's call it BG.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.749
I'm gonna move it to the left side a little bit, something like this.

00:13:05.749 --> 00:13:06.980
I think it looks good.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.195
Let's duplicate it.

00:13:08.195 --> 00:13:11.930
Moving to the right side down and make sure to move

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:16.895
this layer down and put it below your feature three section.

00:13:16.895 --> 00:13:17.855
Here.

00:13:17.855 --> 00:13:18.650
There we go.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.155
All right, I think now it looks great.

00:13:21.155 --> 00:13:23.465
Alright guys, that's all for this video.

00:13:23.465 --> 00:13:27.810
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next video.
