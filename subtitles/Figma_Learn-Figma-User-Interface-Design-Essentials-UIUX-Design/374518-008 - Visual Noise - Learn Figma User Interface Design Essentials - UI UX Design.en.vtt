00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
Hi,

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.110
everyone.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.480
In these video,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.590
you're gonna be talking about visual noise in design.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.090
Visual noise,

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.160
as you can guess from its title,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.670
is all about a screen or part of a digital product,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.650
which has so much information and many elements on it.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.870
When you're designing an APP or a website,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.930
you need to pay attention to details a lot,

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.930
because by the end of the day,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.150
we want to design a screen which is user friendly and easy to walk through.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.750
So make sure to eliminate all the unnecessary elements or information from your screen.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.760
If you're not sure whether your design has video noise or not,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.250
it is recommended to ask for users feedback.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.310
If you look at the pictures on the right side,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.530
you can see that we have two different screens in the left screen.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.320
There is no visual noise,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.850
and it is great in terms of you I design.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.470
On the other hand,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.740
in the right screen,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.750
there is too much visual noise.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.790
As you can see,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.150
there are so many text at the top,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.170
and then some items,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.980
which could be videos or photos than again some videos.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.150
And after that,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.860
some stories and you can recognize that there is not enough white space between those

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.650
elements.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.050
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.850
I will see you in the next video.
