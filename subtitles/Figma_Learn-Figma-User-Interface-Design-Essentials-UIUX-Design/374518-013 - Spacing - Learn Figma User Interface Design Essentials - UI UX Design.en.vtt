00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Hi,

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.100
everyone.

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.110
Welcome back to another lesson off these course in this video,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.750
we're gonna be talking about spacing in design.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.370
Consistency plays a key role in you.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.080
I design.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.360
So when you're designing,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.660
you need to measure everything and keep it consistent.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.360
As a designer,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.220
spacing is up to you.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.660
But once he said it,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.980
you need to use the same spacing patterns in your designs.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.390
For instance,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.750
if you said the spacing between the header and body takes to eight pixels,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.060
you should always use the same spacing throughout your project.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.910
As you can see the picture,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.250
all the spacing has been measured accurately and makes the design clear.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.400
For instance,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.950
if you look at the picture,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:58.390
you can see that we have 50 peak cells from the top to new pictures title and then eight

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.430
pixels from new pictures to the top off subtitle and going on and on.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.350
So in order to keep your design clear,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.550
make sure that you use consistent spacing patterns throughout your project.
