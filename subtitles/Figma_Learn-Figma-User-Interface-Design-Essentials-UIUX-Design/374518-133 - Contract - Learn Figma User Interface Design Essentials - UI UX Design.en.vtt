00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.310
Hi,

00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:00.890
everyone.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.130
In this video,

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:07.260
we're gonna be talking about contracts just like any other business is.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.390
You should have a proper contracting place for starting a project,

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.650
no matter how big or how small that project is.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.950
Having a contract keeps everything clear and protects both parties writes what should be

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.550
included in the agreement.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.610
The most important thing you need to add to the contract is the declaration off your

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.840
services in a clear way.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.260
And sometimes also,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.390
it's even better to mention what you will not do for the clients.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.640
Make sure to mention the deadline for delivering the project and also about the payment

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.350
schedule.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.760
Remember that the contract should not be only about those things that might go wrong.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.860
It's better to focus on what should be done right.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.920
In general,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.420
it's a good idea to get legal advice from a lawyer in advance
