00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Haider, now that our design guide is ready,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.555
it's time to create our wireframe for our landing page.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:08.910
What is actually wireframing?

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.090
Wireframing is a way to design a website or a mobile application at a structural level.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.780
In other words, it's the blueprint of our design and it helps

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.475
us design our project easily and more conveniently.

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:25.130
So without further ado, let's get started.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.465
I'm going to open up fema.

00:00:26.465 --> 00:00:30.170
And here right next to this design II that we created,

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.120
I'm going to create another artwork,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.060
ok, so I'm going to press a key on my keyboard.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.865
And on the right side in the inspector,

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:40.490
you can see that we have some prebuilt art boards.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.545
Okay, I'm gonna choose desktop.

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:46.205
The dimension is 1440 by 1024.

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:47.690
Ok, and there we go.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.580
Let me zoom mean, predict.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.265
Good. All right, so we've created our artwork,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.970
but as you can see, it's not big enough to put all our elements on.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.215
Okay, so first of all,

00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:59.090
I'm going to go ahead and rename it.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.940
So let's double-click its name in

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.570
the layers list and I'm going to rename it to wireframe.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.695
Okay, perfect.

00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:08.060
Then in the inspector,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.505
I'm going to set the height to 6,100, okay, for now.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:14.720
And if you zoom out,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.535
you can see that now we have much more space to work with.

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:22.205
Actually, we have two types of wireframing,

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:25.955
low-fidelity wire frame and a high fidelity wireframes.

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:27.020
What is the difference?

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.865
A low fidelity wireframe includes only the necessary elements.

00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:35.015
So it doesn't need to have brands, collars,

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:38.270
or precise spacing or even icons.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.850
Okay, so we just try to imagine how our final product is going to be.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.575
And we will use simple shapes such as rectangle, Seroquel,

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:53.990
et cetera, to visualize our final project at a structural level, okay?

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.070
And the other hand,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.895
a high-fidelity wireframe requires more content,

00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:01.160
such as the exact size of your buttons,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.385
your elements, or even you could include some colors.

00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:08.420
But for now, we're going to create a low fidelity wireframe together.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.130
Alright, so let's get started.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.330
Landing page.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.195
We need to have a hero section, okay,

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:18.050
at the top of any landing page or any website,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.090
we're going to need a hero section,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.475
which is the most important part of the website.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.890
And you should pay so much attention to it.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.970
Alright, so I'm going to select the Rectangle tool from the toolbar

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.499
and let me click and drag to create a simple rectangle.

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.530
Then I'm gonna go ahead and change your feel.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.850
Let me choose one of our colors styles that we already created.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.500
I'm going to choose secondary,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.850
the dark one, pretty good.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.130
So this is going to be our hero section.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.710
At the top of it, we're gonna need a nav bar.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.695
So our navbar is gonna include a logo,

00:02:51.695 --> 00:02:54.365
then menu items in the middle,

00:02:54.365 --> 00:02:57.380
and finally a Sign In button on the right side.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.590
Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and create another rectangle.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.185
So let me hold down the Shift key,

00:03:03.185 --> 00:03:05.914
click and drag to create a square.

00:03:05.914 --> 00:03:08.615
I'm going to set it to 60 by 60,

00:03:08.615 --> 00:03:11.315
and let's make it round it pretty good.

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:13.430
Then I'm going to choose another color.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.980
Let me choose secondary, the light one.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.335
So this is going to represent our logo,

00:03:18.335 --> 00:03:20.450
okay, then we need some menu items.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.000
Actually, we need three menu items,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.695
but later on if you want,

00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:27.965
you can change it and you don't need to worry about the details.

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:30.815
Alright, so in order to illustrate the menu items.

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:34.940
I'm gonna go ahead and create another rectangle like this.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.410
I'm gonna make it rounded.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.490
So let me increase the amount of corner radius in the inspector.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.465
Fantastic.

00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:43.835
Let me change the color, okay,

00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:47.450
but this time I'm gonna go with this neutron color.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.265
Okay, let me duplicate it.

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:51.890
Two times would be to the right side.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.795
In order to duplicate the layer,

00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:58.565
you can hit Command Z or Control D If you're using Windows once again.

00:03:58.565 --> 00:04:02.480
So these three shapes represents our menu items, okay?

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.445
And then on the right side,

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:06.470
we need to have a Sign In button.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.275
So let me create another rectangle,

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:10.565
a little bit larger,

00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:16.610
and I am going to make it rounded and let me change it's color to this accent one, okay.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.155
You could use, for example,

00:04:18.155 --> 00:04:21.860
the a secondary color as we used for our logo.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.545
But since we are going to use the accent color

00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:27.440
for the Sign In button in our final product.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.820
You could use that as well.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.710
And here I'm gonna write something.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.690
So let me create a text layer and let me write button, fantastic.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.310
Let me select it and increase its font size to 17.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.745
For now.

00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:42.845
For now, we are not going to use

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:47.255
our textiles because it really doesn't matter for this stage.

00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:48.770
But if you prefer,

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.035
use your text styles as well.

00:04:51.035 --> 00:04:53.750
For example, you could use this one medium, right?

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.924
Let me select both these layers.

00:04:55.924 --> 00:04:59.630
I'm gonna hold down the Shift key on my keyboard and click on both of them.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.260
And then I'm going to align them both horizontally and vertically.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.690
Let me make it a little bit larger so we can use our textiles and for example,

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.015
we could use Maine 20.

00:05:11.015 --> 00:05:13.595
Let me align it. Alright, so far so good.

00:05:13.595 --> 00:05:17.165
So we've created our nav bar successfully.

00:05:17.165 --> 00:05:21.710
Now, let me select all these menu items and group them.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.065
And I'm going to call it menu,

00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:28.174
and I'm going to call this rectangle logo.

00:05:28.174 --> 00:05:31.475
Finally, let's select both these layers,

00:05:31.475 --> 00:05:34.580
group them, and let's call it button.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.110
And last but not least,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.245
you can select all these three layers,

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:40.760
since we've grouped them.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.880
And once again group them and align these final group horizontally to the center.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.470
And you can give it a name like nav bar r, right?

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.535
So far so good.

00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:54.140
We have created our navbar.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.834
Then for our hero section,

00:05:55.834 --> 00:06:00.920
we need to have an image on the right side and a large heading,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.455
a description and a call to action.

00:06:03.455 --> 00:06:05.990
A call to action is actually a button,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.935
ok. For example, a registration button, a Sign In button.

00:06:09.935 --> 00:06:11.165
It doesn't matter for now.

00:06:11.165 --> 00:06:14.600
What matters is to create some shapes to

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.010
represent our title or description and our buttons.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.205
So I'm gonna go ahead and select the Rectangle tool,

00:06:22.205 --> 00:06:24.230
click and drag like this.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.610
I'm gonna make it round it.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.800
Let me enlarge it a little bit,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.710
since this is our title and it's perfect,

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.620
then I'm going to change its color to our secondary lined duplicated movie down.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.940
And I'm gonna make it a little bit smaller to show that this is a text,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.100
okay, once again, duplicate it,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.885
make it a little bit smaller.

00:06:44.885 --> 00:06:45.619
Fantastic.

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:48.335
So this is going to be our tidal.

00:06:48.335 --> 00:06:49.010
Ok.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.430
So I am going to group them and let's call it title.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.845
Then we need to have some description.

00:06:54.845 --> 00:07:00.320
For our description, we could use the same technique and create a rectangle like this.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.155
I'm gonna make it rounded like this.

00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:08.299
And I'm gonna choose this neutral color for our description of it down,

00:07:08.299 --> 00:07:10.610
make it a little bit smaller,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.030
duplicated, make it a little bit smaller.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.840
And that's all.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.615
So our description is also ready.

00:07:17.615 --> 00:07:19.955
I'm gonna select all three elements,

00:07:19.955 --> 00:07:23.315
group them, Command Z or Control G on your keyboard.

00:07:23.315 --> 00:07:25.625
And let's name it, description.

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:26.555
Fantastic.

00:07:26.555 --> 00:07:28.820
Last but not least, we need a button.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.095
Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and double-click on this button to select it.

00:07:33.095 --> 00:07:36.965
I'm gonna copy it command C or control C on your keyboard.

00:07:36.965 --> 00:07:40.430
And then select these large rectangle,

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.420
which is our background and heat Command V or control V.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.040
Ok. And now as you can see,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.430
this button is not inside our navbar group,

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.495
it's outside of it.

00:07:50.495 --> 00:07:52.340
Okay, I'm going to put it here.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.905
So the left side of our hero section is ready.

00:07:54.905 --> 00:07:56.315
But what about the right side?

00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:57.380
For the right side,

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.665
I am going to use a very simple feature, okay?

00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:02.915
So I'm gonna choose Rectangle,

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:05.195
click and drag like this,

00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:06.575
make it round it.

00:08:06.575 --> 00:08:09.259
I'm going to increase the corner radius amount.

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:11.645
Okay, let's set it to 40.

00:08:11.645 --> 00:08:16.519
And finally, let's change its color to secondary light.

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:17.225
Pretty good.

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:22.445
And now I'm going to select all these three groups and move them down a little bit.

00:08:22.445 --> 00:08:25.925
Let me make it a little bit smaller and move it down.

00:08:25.925 --> 00:08:27.110
Alright, so as you can see,

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.595
our hero section is done.

00:08:28.595 --> 00:08:33.140
So we've just created a low fidelity wireframe for our hero section.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.865
And in the next video we will continue our journey to complete this landing page.

00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:40.560
So see you in the next one.
