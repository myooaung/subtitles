00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.340
Hi,

00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.920
everyone.

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.740
And welcome back to another video of these course in this video,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.750
we're gonna be talking about exporting your fines.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.320
As a UX designer,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.550
you need to know how to export your files properly.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.080
Inner toe.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.720
Hand them over to your developer or to your clients.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.790
So suppose that you want to export these images as in order to do that.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.810
First of all,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.070
you can select one object and then in the property section you have the experts section.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.130
If I click on this plus icon,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.430
you can see that you can modify these settings.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.020
As you can see by default.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.750
It said to one X What does that mean?

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.510
It means that if you export it as a tease,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.250
you will get the same dimension off your file.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.800
However,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.820
if you're designing this for an application which requires you to have different fine size

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.820
,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.040
you can open up this drop menu and you can set it to two x or three X.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.650
Okay,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.080
you can also write the Suffolk's here,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.380
and then you can specify the format,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.980
for example,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.250
that considered to PNG J P G svg and Pdf.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.700
And then you can previous and finally you can click on export and there we go.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.470
We can easily set a name Anglican safe.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.250
However,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.990
if you don't want to export your files and you want to just share this project with your

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.250
teammates or with your client,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.730
you can head over to the toolbar section and click undies blue button,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.150
which is called share.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.500
And here you can invite someone to,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.810
well,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.120
this project or to edit this project.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.560
It's totally up to you.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.100
You can also copy the link and send it to someone else.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.670
Okay,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.570
if you want to present this project on your website,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.710
you can click on getting bad code and you will get an eye frame code which you can grab and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.100
copy and paste it in your html Fine.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.220
And you will get this project live on your website.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.590
So if you make any changes here,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.670
it will apply to your website as well.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.630
So it's pretty amazing are right,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.000

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.300
