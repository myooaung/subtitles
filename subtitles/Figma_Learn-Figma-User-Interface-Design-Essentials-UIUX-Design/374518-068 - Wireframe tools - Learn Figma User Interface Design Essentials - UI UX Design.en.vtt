Now that you know the importance on wire framing in your UX design,

it's time to talk about the tools,

which are absolutely useful for preparing your wire frame.

Although some designers prefer to use standalone software for wire framing,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.110
there are designers who prefer to use Web based tools for wire framing.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.010
