00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
Hi,

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.180
everyone.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.950
Welcome to the first chapter of these course In these section,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.640
we're going to be talking about the differences between you,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.740
I and UX design and the course structure that you can understand how the course is

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.740
organized in order for you to follow it up properly.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.450
And last but not least,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.810
we're going to be talking about the tools and requirements that you need to know to proceed

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.620
the course.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.050
So without further ado,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.300
let's get started.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.290
First of all,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.780
I'm going to talk about the differences between you I and UX design.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.190
Although both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.470
their roles are totally different.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.750
Your ex design is a more technical and analytical field.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.840
However you I design refers to graphic design with more complex responsibilities.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.550
So let me give you an example.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.970
If you consider a product like a car,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.980
the chassis is the code,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.850
which gives it a clear structure.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.520
The other parts,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.620
such as doors,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.420
full filter etcetera,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.310
represent the UX design,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.910
which lets the car function properly.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.230
On the other hand,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.710
you ideas nine represents the appearance of the car.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.070
It's sensors,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.810
etcetera.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.140
In other words,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.110
you X,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.550
which stands for user experience,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.550
is about how a product should work.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.710
And you I,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.080
which stands for user interface,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.610
is about how a product should look.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.460
So you,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.120
as a product designer,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.090
should know how these two terms work together and how to distinguish between them.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.070
For instance,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.750
you should know what are the responsibilities off a UX designer.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.190
And on the other hand,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.580
what are the responsibilities off a U I designer?

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.650
As you can see in the pictures,

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.680
we have two different screens.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.900
The left one shows us how the product should work.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.220
For example,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.440
suppose that you have a screen with two buttons and to text fields.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.280
Okay,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.930
the U X shows us how these buttons should interact with the user,

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.740
and the right picture is all about user interface,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.740
and it shows us how the product should look.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.510
For instance,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.280
here we have a button and a square.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.330
The your eye designer decides how big this button should be or which color is suitable for

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.350
that square.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.440
These are the you I designer responsibilities.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.130
All right,

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.460
thank you so much for watching this video.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.700
And I will see you in the next video
