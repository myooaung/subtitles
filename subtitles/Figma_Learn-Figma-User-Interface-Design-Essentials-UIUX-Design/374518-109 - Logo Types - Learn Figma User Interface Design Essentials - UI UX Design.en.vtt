00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
Hello,

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.350
everyone in these section,

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.910
we're going to be designing our logo.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.220
And also in these video,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.240
we're going to be talking about seven different times off logo design.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.710
So without further ado,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.920
let's get a started.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.050
The first local type is called Monogram or you could say letter marks.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.080
Here we have different logos as examples,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.050
such as HBO,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.860
which stands for Home Box Office.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.890
As you can see here,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.920
we have Onley letters,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.500
so they're kind of spelled out and represent their company.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.120
The second type is called Ward Marks or,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.840
let's say,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.010
local times they're actually similar to a letter mark.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.700
However,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.480
award Mark focuses on a business name alone,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.280
like Google,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.410
Canham or Jeep.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.320
The next local type is called abstract local marks like Pepsi,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.240
Nike or BP.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.580
As you can see here,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.720
as a matter of fact,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.370
an abstract mark is a type of pictorial logo,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.730
and the next local type is called pictorial marks or logos symbols like Apple logo to Eater

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.600
and other famous brands.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.070
Actually,

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.300
a pictorial mark is simply an icon that represents the company's characteristics.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.630
The next local type,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.250
these mascots mascot logos are logos that involve an illustrated character according to 99

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.470

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.240

Great article under website.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.030

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.960

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.610

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.550
You can find a letter combined with an illustration or a specific shape.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.540
And last but not least,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:01.120

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.650
