00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.370
Hi,

00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:00.950
everyone.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.860
And welcome back to another video of thes section in this video.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.720
We're going to start designing our OTP verification pages together.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.930
So without further ado,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.430
let's get started.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.640
First thing searched,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.390
we need to have any art board.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.280
So I'm gonna press a and I'm gonna choose iPhone 11 pro for X like this.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.860
I'm gonna move it here right below my lunch screen in order to keep our campus organized.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.890
And then let's rename.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.260
These aren't poor to OTP.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.340
It's going to be our first screen because in total,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.450
we're gonna have three different OTP screens and we're going to create them.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.340
Step by step,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.470
are right now.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.270
What do we need?

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.740
We need a home indicator to put right at the bottom so we can easily copy and pace it from

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.350
our previous art boards.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.630
I'm going to copy this and paste it here pretty good.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.410
We need the status far as well.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.850
Okay,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.330
so I'm gonna go ahead and place an image,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.930
and here I have bars.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.150
Status bar.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.550
I have dark and light version,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.510
and the light means that you can use it on a light bank round.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.960
Okay,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.990
so the status bar is dark.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.850
I'm gonna go ahead and open it.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.960
Place it here.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.320
Now,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.210
let me align it to the center.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.730
And also,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.580
it needs to stick to the top edge of the screen.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.130
Okay,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.730
Like this are right.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.280
So what?

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.350
Also we need We need an illustration that I already prepared for you.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.390
So let's go ahead and place another image here in the assets.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.840
Fuller,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.970
you have an illustration fuller.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.150
I'm gonna open it up.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.560
And here you have OTP.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.140
So let's open this up.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.550
And I'd like to mention that I downloaded these illustrations from the Andrada TKO website

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.550
.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.410
She's a very great website that you can get access to amazing royalty free illustrations.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.920
Okay,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.650
So if you want to use another illustration,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.070
make sure to check this website out.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.800
Are right.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.230
First,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.020
let's align into the center.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.400
Then I'm going to check the top,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.930
adding,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.310
Actually,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.870
it's going to be 56 peak cells.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.520
Okay.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.720
Like this?

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.770
Pretty good.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.870
Then I need a text layer.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.980
So let's write OTP verification.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.120
Let's change the fund.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.640
Two months separate like this,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.280
I'm going to use the ball version,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.180
and also we need to change the font size for 24 points pretty good,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.200
and the top heading is going to be 60 pick cells like this.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.100
Then let's duplicate these text layer moving down and changed the way to regular and also

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.500
change the font size to 16 points.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.320
I'm gonna align it to the center and here.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.110
That's right.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.990
We will send you at one time password to dese Mobile number.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.610
Then I'm going to resize thes text layer.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.250
Okay,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.430
To have a feat,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.440
size takes layer like this.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.410
That's a line into the center.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.930
And also I'm going to change the line height.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:14.370
So what I'm going to do is writing 16 times 1.5 and then p X like this.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.640
It's a great formula.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.250
If you don't know how to choose your line height,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.320
you can use it.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.900
You can write your fund size and multiply days by 1.5.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.490
Okay,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.280
however,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.690
remember in fig mama,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.360
you need to add the p X keyword at the end.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.790
Okay,

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.650
pretty good.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.950
Now let's select these two text layers and let's change the text color.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.690
I'm going to set them 23 a three a and three a.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.260
Like this pretty good.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.500
And now let's select this takes layer and duplicated movie down.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.150
And here let's write,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.360
Enter mobile number and I'm going to change the fund to SF Pro text like this change the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.120
way to regular and also the fund size to 14 points like this and when I lining to the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.070
center.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.730
And I also want to change the Connor to be nine b nine and B nine.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.350
Okay,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.230
pretty good.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.860
Now let's elect these text layer and check the pad ings.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.380
Okay,

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.470
As you can see,

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.010
the top hiding now is 22 pixels.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.840
However,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.780
it's better to set it to 24 pixels.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.310
Okay,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.190
then that shake the petting of Destexhe Now it said 2 33 p excels.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.990
However,

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.300
let's set it 2 34 p cells.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.780
Okay,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.100
then here we need a tax feel to enter the mobile number.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.310
So what I'm going to do is just selecting these texts.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.070
Feline.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.020
I'm going to copy this and paste it here,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.200
moving down pretty good.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.460
And let's decrease the with 2 233 like this.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.290
Aligning to the center,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.950
let me move it down and then duplicate this text layer movie down changed the way too bold

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.050
make sure that it's a line to the center and I'm going to change the color too.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.920
Three a three a.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.580
M and three A.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.530
Like this.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.170
And here,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.270
let's write a random number.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.820
So,

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.500
for instance,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.360
began right?

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.330
Plus 49 +111222 and 333 Pretty good.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.800
And the bottom padding is going to be a pixels like this.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.330
Select both layers,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.350
move them up.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.280
And we need to get a 24 peak sell top.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.710
Adding,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.300
like this pretty good.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.760
Now you can select these three elements,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.350
group them and let's name eat more by lumber.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.940
Pretty good.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.730
The last thing we need is a button.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.330
Okay,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.300
so I'm gonna go ahead and copy and paste thes signing button.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.840
Okay,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.240
that's paste it here pretty good.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.900
First of all,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.470
I'm going to rename me to get OTP Button are right.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.160
Then I need to remove these right arrow because we don't need that.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.930
And after that,

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.800
I'm gonna align these text layer to the center.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.750
So first,

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.780
select this text layer and then select the rectangle aligning to the center that's aligning

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.320
to the center in the text section as well.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.240
And I'm going to change you to get OTP pretty good.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.840
And also,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.170
I think it's a good idea to change the place off these circles.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.860
So let's choose the blue one and I want a movie to the left side like this and choose this

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.140
one the purple one,

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.830
and move it to the bottom,

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.280
and that's rotate it a little bit pretty good.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.270
I'm gonna move Thesis blue one a little bit down and now I think it's great.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.260
So let me zoom out a little bit.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.150
There we go.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.490
Can you see how amazing and beautiful it?

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.730
A.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.670
So the bottom padding of peace button is going to be 64.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.520
Picks cells like this,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.520
and I think it's a good idea to increase the fund sites off our mobile number.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.320
So I'm going to select that and let's change the to 18 points.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.970
Now it's more visible,

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.510
so I'm gonna line into the center,

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.940
move it up,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.290
and it's going to have an a peak cell bottom padding.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.920
Now it's much,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.560
much better are right guys,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.520
we have successfully created our first screen.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.310
Now let's go ahead and create the other two.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.820
So let's duplicate thes screen pretty good.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.480
And I'm going to change these text to end her.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:32.230
The OTP send to plus 49 +111 222 in 333 Okay,

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.750
I'm going to select thes telephone number,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.910
and I'm gonna make it bold like this.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.710
It's pretty good.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.770
Then I'm going to remove this text layer and also this telephone number pretty good.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.330
However,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.990
I'm going to keep this line,

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.780
however,

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.330
let's cut it and paste it here because we don't need that group anymore.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:56.540
And then I'm going to set the with 2 48 like this pretty good.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.080
Now let's add a text layer and that's just writes a random number.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.980
For instance.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.640
Seven.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.430
Let's make it regular like this,

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.640
and also the fund size is going to be 24 points like this.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.970
Move it up a little bit to get on a pixel bottom padding pretty good.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.990
Then let's align it with our line like this.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.450
Group them and let's rename me to takes field,

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.440
then duplicated movie to the right side.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:32.090
It's gonna have a 24 pixel left padding like this and duplicated once again and once again

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:32.950
pretty good.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.220
Select all of them grouped them and aligning to the center,

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.820
then that select the second number and change it to something else for incense.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.520
Three.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.940
And I'm going to remove the other two because in this screen the user is entering the

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.650
password.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.130
So we need to somehow depict this process.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.650
Okay,

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:59.390
that I'm going to select these two lines and change the color to be nine B nine and B nine

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.060
like this Pretty good.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.330
And now everything is done.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:03.940
Okay,

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.340
then let's select this group.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.590
Move it up and the top hiding is going to be 58 pixels like this.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.600
I'm gonna have one more text layer.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.360
So let's duplicate these text layer and move it down.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.450
And here we need to write.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.120
Didn't you receive the OTP?

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.250
Then let's write.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.020
Rescind OTP like this.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.170
I'm going to change the fund to as of pro text like this.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:36.020
And also let's change the font size to 14 points again that selectees part of text and

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:44.350
changed the kanako to be nine b nine and B nine and also select thesis recent OTP section

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.600
and change it to 27 43 f d like this,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.430
it stop fighting is going to be 40 pixels.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:59.630
And the lasting unity view is changing our button because now we need to have a deactivated

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.680
very five buttons.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.990
So first of all,

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.030
let's change these takes to verify.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.870
Great.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.130
Then I'm going to select this rectangle to layer,

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.270
duplicated,

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:17.350
remove the drop shadow and then move it up right above the verify text like this.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.290
I'm going to change the color to a solid one.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.810
Let's change it to white,

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:28.060
and after that I'm going to decrease the capacity to 40% like this.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.310
And also I'm going to select these very fight X okay,

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:36.490
and let's decrease the opacity off the layer to 50% Pretty nice.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.920
And last but not least,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.860
remember to rename your group always very fine,

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.950
and that's all.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.190
As we can see now,

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:50.290
we have a disabled button because the user didn't enter the OTP code completely.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:50.850
Okay,

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:51.560
are right.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.450
Now let's duplicate this screen in order to design our last scream.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.900
So I want a movie to the right side a little bit,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.370
and now what do we need?

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:00.950
First of all,

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.430
we need to complete these code,

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:07.740
So what I'm going to do is selecting these number carpet is pasted here,

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.290
moving to the right side.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.390
And I want to move it right above these text line in our layers panel.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.990
Then let's write zero pretty good.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.840
Make sure to align them to the center like this.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.730
And after that,

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:25.980
I'm going to change the color to this one pretty good and once again duplicated moving to

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.980
the right side.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:27.650
However,

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.540
we need to move it in our layers panel as well.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.350
Like this.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:35.920
Let's change it to to change the color off our text line.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.760
Pretty good.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.190
And last but not least,

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.130
now we need to enable our button.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:40.660
Okay,

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.250
so I'm going to open up this group and let's remove their explaining that we just created

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:50.070
and I'm gonna increase the capacity of my text to 100%.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:50.440
All right,

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:50.920

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.410

I hope you enjoyed it.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.590

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.140
So see you.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:56.450
