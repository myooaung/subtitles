00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
Hi,

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.040
Ron.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.370
In these lesson,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.120
we're gonna be talking about color palette.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.980
Creating a color scheme for product might seem like a hard task,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.130
especially if you're a beginner.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.970
However,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:13.940
in reality,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.870
it's not as complicated as many designers think.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.760
What is the color scheme you are?

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.090
Color scheme is a mixture of colors used in your user interface.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.880
Almost every color scheme contains the falling groups of colors.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.480
Primary colors,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.860
secondary colors,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.260
accent colors,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.280
neutrals,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.610
semantic colors.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.560
What are the primary and secondary colors?

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.650
Primary and secondary colors are the base colors of your user interface.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.120
The colors,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.210
which are used most frequently in your you I design,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.590
are called primary Colors.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.500
Most designers usually choose brand colors as primary colors.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.930
As a matter of fact,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.490
it's recommended to have no more than three primary colors.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.630
Optionally.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.200
You can use secondary callers in order to distinguish your products and make more

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.000
interesting you.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.050
I designs all right,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.660
but how to choose colors properly When you're working with colors,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.000
you should not create a combination of random colors because the result would not be the

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.050
one you expect.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.450
In order to understand how to work with colors.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.180
First,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.720
you need to know what the color will ease and how it works.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.070
Here are important color combinations you need to know complimentary,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.330
which are two colors that are on opposite sides off the color with,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.940
and the next one is monochromatic,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.800
which are three shades,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.940
tones and teens of one based color.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.530
And the last one is analogous,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.530
which are three colors that are side by side on the color wheel.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.300
If you look at the right side of the picture,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.810
you can see that we have a color will here.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.620
As you can see,

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.260
we have monochromatic.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.670
For example,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.160
if you look at the red,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.650
we have three different shades or,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.160
let's say tens of one based color,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.570
and also we have complementary.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.250
For instance,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.750
here we have purple and yellow,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.220
which are on opposite sides off the color with,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.970
so the combination of these colors is great
