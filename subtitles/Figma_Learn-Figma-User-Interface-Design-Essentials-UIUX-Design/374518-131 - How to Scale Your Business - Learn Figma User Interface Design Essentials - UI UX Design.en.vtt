00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
Hi,

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.790
everyone.

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.610
I hope you're doing well in these video.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.320
We're gonna be talking about how you can scale your business.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.190
Now that you're running your own business,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.980
you may be wondering how you can scale your business or,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.030
in other words,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.810
how you can increase the revenue of your business dramatically.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.050
When it comes to online businesses.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.540
Most entrepreneurs usually focus on one geographic region for the sake of simplicity.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.120
It's a great idea for starting your journey.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.030
However,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.730
it's not enough for developing a profitable business.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.170
So,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.240
as you may guess,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.420
the best solution is to expand your global options and get customers from all over the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.980
world.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.570
The next step is trying to automate your manual processes,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.140
which can prevent wasting your time because no matter how many customers you have,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.100
there are only 24 hours in a day.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.700
We can utilize buffer website to manage your social media automatically,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.440
and also there are plenty of other tools to remind your customers about,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.550
their invoice says in no time.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.330
So you don't need to spend so much time on those tasks that can be delegated and done

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.300
automatically.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.080
Instead,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.550
you should focus on your content and the outcome off each project
