isn't it?

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.480
So right at the top,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.060
we need to have a surge park,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.780
however,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.850

Okay,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.340
So for each notification,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.820
we're gonna have a profile,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.580

And also let's decrease the font size to 14 points pretty good.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.700
Then let's align it with our profile image like this,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.910
and it's left padding is going to be eight pixels like this and duplicate it will be down.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.330
And here,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.050
let's write message.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.200
You're going to change it later.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.170
.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.470

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.740
43 f d like this.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.770
We also need a right arrow.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.400
Okay,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.180
so I'm gonna place each from our assets file.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.600
That's use small arrow.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.530
Place it here and then I'm going to change its color to to be 47 FC like this.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.340
And I'm going to choose this frame,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.840
which is our small arrow,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.330
and that's align it with our profile image like this,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.740
and it's right padding is going to be 30 pixels like this.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.520
Pretty good.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.960
Actually,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.970
we need a separator here as well,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:43.220
so I'm going to create a line like this that set the with 2 315 aligning to the center and

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.330
changes color to the double e one e and F.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.220
And it's not padding is going to be 16 pixels pretty good.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.140

I'm going to select all these elements.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.170
Group them.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.260
Let's college message pretty good.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.470

moving down its top heading is going to be 16 picks owns,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.140
and then I'm going to duplicate it once again once again until I get something like this.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.650
Okay,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.210
so now,

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.300
instead of writing the information one by one,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.010
we're going to use our favorite plugging content.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.290
Really?

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:21.810
Okay,

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.630
so let's go ahead and run it.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.670
And then I'm gonna show you how you can insert riel later in a second.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.190

Let's go to the avatars.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.870
Anglican male or female.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.100
There we go.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.820

Okay.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.040
All right.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.070
So now we need to add our names.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.590
Okay.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.230
However,

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.630
because thes 1st 1 is our master component.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.040
First,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.350
we need to duplicate it,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.950
okay,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.800
to create an incense of it,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.190
and it's removed a master component like this and then that's used the name layer off

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.910
females.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.350
So I'm going to select this one old shift,

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.050

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.130
And there we go.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.020
Can you see how easy teas to apply these changes?

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.150
It's pretty amazing.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.110
Now it's time to select the man's name.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.540
Okay,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.060
so let's select them and kitty Candies.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.050
Three darts.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.050
This time I'm going to set it to main.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.770
Anchalee can apply on.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.130
That's all are right.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.490
The only thing that we can not add randomly is thes message.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.940
Okay,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.420
so we need to change them.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.990
One might want So let's select these takes message,

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.650
and I'm going to write Ireland.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.350
I just sent you $20 like this.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.500
And the next one,

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.560
Theresa,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.750
I sent you $99.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.110
Fantastic.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.470
And in order to complete the screen,

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.260
we need to do only one more thing.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.840
And that is changing thes status.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.110
So,

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.340
as you can see now,

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.110
we have only active status.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.560
Okay,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.520
so what I'm going to do is,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.350
for instance,

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.100
electing this status,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.400
and that's changed it to a business status.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.110
So I'm going to write F seven a seven double zero like this.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.920
Let's copy these color code,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.790
and I'm gonna choose this one as well.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.360
And this fun,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.830
Let's paste it here.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.490
And we need one more state.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:46.250
So let's use this one and change it to see CE and ce car Pittis and paste it for the 2nd 1

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.630
pretty good.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.240
And this one is going to be our offline state.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.720
Okay.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.360
