00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.515
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:06.464
In this video, we're going to start designing our first feature section,

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:08.880
which is the credit card section.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.140
Okay, so first of all,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.600
let me take a look at our wireframes.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.734
So as you can see for the first feature section,

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:21.090
you're going to have a credit card on the right side and a title and a subtitle.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.300
Okay. Alright, so without further ado, let's get started.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.810
First things first I'm gonna unhide my layout greed.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.930
Okay, so I'm going to press Control G on my keyboard,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.300
and now my layout grids is visible.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.605
So on the left side,

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:37.695
we need to have a title and a subtitle.

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:41.330
Okay, so I'm going to create a text layer like this,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.110
and I'm gonna change the text style to h, h2.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.540
And here let me write one card for all your payments. Perfect.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.695
Alright, so I'm gonna move it to the left side and let me decrease its width to 366.

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:01.700
Ok, so it covers four of our columns, okay, like this.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.000
Then what I'm gonna do is change its color.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.570
Ok?

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.650
So I'm gonna choose primary color like this.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.230
I'm gonna duplicate it, move it down.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.345
And here we need to have a description.

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:20.150
For this description, I'm gonna go ahead and change the text style to buy the main.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.950
Okay, like this will be down a little bit and I already prepared a text,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.985
so I'm going to copy and paste it from my clipboard. There we go.

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:30.260
So as you can see,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.465
the description is going to be this one.

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:36.770
Get 3% back on everything you buy with the draft GAR,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.540
register today and enjoy every aspect of your business school, isn't it?

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.400
Now let's change the color.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.280
I don't need the primary color anymore.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.970
I'm gonna need the secondary light like this.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.150
Alright, so I'm gonna select this description and hold

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.224
down the Option or Alt key on my keyboard.

00:01:56.224 --> 00:02:01.145
And I'm going to hover my mouse on top of my tidal to see the margin,

00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:03.170
but I'm gonna make it a 30 pixels.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.330
Okay, so I'm going to use the arrow keys on my keyboard to move it down a little bit.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.065
There we go.

00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:12.665
Now we've got 30 pixels and it looks pretty good,

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:15.015
okay, all right, everything is cool.

00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:18.800
We could go ahead and create our credit card on the right side.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.120
So to do that,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.965
I'm going to need a rectangle.

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:24.440
So let me click on rectangle,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.440
click and drag to dry rectangle here.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.550
And as you can see,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.060
the width is set to 466 pixels and it covers five columns, okay?

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.775
And the height is going to be 268 pixels like this.

00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:47.675
Think it's cool, and let me increase the corner radius to 24, like this. Fantastic.

00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:52.490
Alright, so I'm going to hide my layout grieves for now because I don't need that.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.905
I'm going to press Control G on my keyword.

00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:57.200
What do we need for a credit card?

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.135
We need a name at the top.

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:01.310
We need the credit card number,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.905
we need the credit card issuer logo.

00:03:03.905 --> 00:03:05.945
And basically that's all.

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:06.560
Okay.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.095
So first of all, I'm gonna change its color to our secondary dark like this.

00:03:12.095 --> 00:03:15.440
And then I'm going to add simple shapes to it in order to

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.920
create such a great background for our credit card.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.030
To do that, I'm going to select the SAR tool like that,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.230
hold down the Shift key,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.015
click and drag like this.

00:03:26.015 --> 00:03:28.520
And as you can see, we've got a star,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.660
but what I'm gonna do is change its count from five to seven to get something like this.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.470
And after that, I am going to increase the corner radius like this.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.520
So you can hold down the Shift key on your keyboard and click on

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.510
these small circle at the top and move your mouse down.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.700
And then I'm going to change your ratio.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.500
So as you can see here,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.990
we have three different circles, okay?

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.820
The first one is the corner radius,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.910
the second one is the ratio between the edges.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.500
And the last one is count.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.720
So our count is already says,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.435
however, I'm gonna change the ratio.

00:04:05.435 --> 00:04:08.195
I'm going to hold down the Shift key, click and drag.

00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:14.855
Okay, I'm going to increase it to around 74 or 75 like this.

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:20.390
And then I'm going to increase the corner radius a little bit to smooth those corners.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.190
Perfect. You can play around with

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.390
these numbers and values to get the shape you are looking for,

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.715
okay, but I think it's a cool shaped to start with.

00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:31.175
If you're not satisfied with the look of this shape,

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:34.790
you can easily modify those values and create your own shape.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.755
And this is what I want you to do.

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:38.750
Don't just copy and paste what I do.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.980
Make sure to create your own version and use your own creativity.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.260
This is how you will become a good designer.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.040
Alright, now I'm gonna change its color to a light purple,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.385
okay, but I don't want to use our colors signs.

00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:55.219
I'm gonna set the color to CAA,

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:57.410
C7, and double f.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.550
Okay, there we go.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.770
It's a color that I was looking for.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.330
I'm gonna move it a little bit.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.160
As you can see, this star is outside this credit card, okay?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.840
Which is a problem for now,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.225
but we need to mask it somehow.

00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:12.875
If I select both of them,

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:16.639
if I hold down the Shift key and select both of them and click on Mask,

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.430
our rectangle will be disappeared.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.245
Let's give it a try, and there we go.

00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:23.180
So in order to prevent that,

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.370
we could duplicate our rectangle.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.245
So I'm gonna select the rectangle.

00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:28.595
I'm gonna duplicate it,

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:30.470
Command Z or Control D.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.079
And as you can see now I have two rectangles.

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:33.560
Okay?

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.820
I'm gonna select the top one and hold down the Shift key and select my star.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.190
And now I'm going to click on mass there.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.675
So here we use this rectangle to mask our star,

00:05:44.675 --> 00:05:50.135
and this rectangle stays as our credit cards boundaries like this.

00:05:50.135 --> 00:05:54.065
Alright, let me select this star and move it around like this.

00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:54.860
Pretty good.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.185
I'm gonna make it a little bit larger.

00:05:57.185 --> 00:05:58.295
Fantastic.

00:05:58.295 --> 00:06:01.595
Then I'm gonna duplicate it will be to the right side.

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:03.440
And also I'm going to move it down,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.230
as you can see, it's above our first shape.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.655
I'm going to move it down.

00:06:07.655 --> 00:06:10.685
Nothing has changed because both of them use the same color.

00:06:10.685 --> 00:06:12.725
So I'm gonna select my second shape,

00:06:12.725 --> 00:06:14.810
which is now below my first shape.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.730
And I'm going to give it a color code, 994.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.370
And our left, like this. Pretty good.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.945
Move it to the right side.

00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:26.255
Perfect. Alright, what else do we need?

00:06:26.255 --> 00:06:29.450
I'm going to select my first shape again, duplicated,

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.590
moving down a like this and let me scale it.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.715
I'm going to press key on my keyboard and hold down the Shift key,

00:06:37.715 --> 00:06:40.760
click and drag like this, move it down.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.300
And now I'm going to set its color to my secondary dark,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.280
okay, something like this.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.490
Finally, I'm gonna give it an accent color as well.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.465
So what I'm gonna do is duplicate these last shape.

00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:56.240
Created Command Z or Control D.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.095
And also I'm gonna select my first shape and duplicate it as well.

00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:04.010
Then I'm going to select this star for, in my case,

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.980
if you take a look at the layers list on the left side,

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.145
and I'm going to change its color to accent like this.

00:07:10.145 --> 00:07:15.815
However, I'm going to mask it using the star five that be just duplicated.

00:07:15.815 --> 00:07:18.845
So what I'm gonna do is select both of them.

00:07:18.845 --> 00:07:20.675
So star five, this one,

00:07:20.675 --> 00:07:24.170
hold down the Shift key and click on this SAR for okay,

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.510
and then I'm going to click on Mask.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.140
There we go.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.425
We've just created a new mass or pay, and it looks great.

00:07:30.425 --> 00:07:35.735
However, I'm gonna modify the position of my shapes a little bit to make it look better.

00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:38.960
I'm going to select this SAR to move it down like

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.365
this to cover the right side of my credit card.

00:07:42.365 --> 00:07:45.530
And also I'm going to select other shapes, mass group,

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.635
star one and star three,

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.380
and move them to the left side. Like this.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.785
Are right, cool. Our credit card looks great now.

00:07:54.785 --> 00:07:59.000
So we've created a simple background using simple shapes.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.994
Now we need to add the details,

00:08:00.994 --> 00:08:05.330
as I mentioned before for this credit current and we need a name at the top.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.930
So I am going to select the Text tool and create a text layer.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:14.015
And let's write a random name such as Ronald research,

00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:16.145
like this, I'm going to select it.

00:08:16.145 --> 00:08:18.380
And in the layers, this, as you can see,

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.750
it's below our credit card.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:27.305
I'm going to move it up like this and let me change the text style to h four, like this.

00:08:27.305 --> 00:08:30.890
And I'm gonna set the color to white. Fantastic.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:36.620
All right, now what I'm gonna do is select all the layers of our credit cards, okay,

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.350
which is this mass group and this rectangle,

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:44.420
it's so important is rectangle for the aid is the boundaries of your credit card.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.910
So you need to make sure to select that as well.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.015
Command Z or Control G to create a group.

00:08:50.015 --> 00:08:52.430
And I'm going to call it credit card.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.320
And now I can zoom in.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.305
So let's check the padding for this X layer.

00:08:57.305 --> 00:09:00.950
I'm gonna set a 40 pixel top and left padding.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:01.760
Ok.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.855
I'm gonna move it to the right side and move it down like this. There we go.

00:09:05.855 --> 00:09:08.660
Now I'm gonna duplicate it, move it down.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.735
And here we need to have the credit cards number.

00:09:11.735 --> 00:09:13.580
So let's write something like this.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.980
4242 space.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:22.895
Hold down the Shift key and press eight 1234 to create these stars space,

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:29.420
again, 1234, space 2456, something like this.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.115
And for these texts layer,

00:09:31.115 --> 00:09:35.000
I'm gonna change the text style to main. Fantastic.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.060
And it's going to have 40 pixel left padding and afforded pixel bottom padding like this.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:41.765
Pretty good.

00:09:41.765 --> 00:09:43.310
Last but not least,

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.350
we need to create a logo, okay,

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.080
you can easily go ahead and download, for example,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.290
the Visa card logo or MasterCard logo.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.380
However, we need to create a MasterCard logo simply

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.650
by ourselves because it's going to be unique for our design.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:58.880
Okay, so as we know,

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.200
the MasterCard's logo is circles combined together.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.970
Ok, so what I'm gonna do,

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.815
I'm gonna select the ellipse,

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:08.085
hold down the Shift key,

00:10:08.085 --> 00:10:10.295
click and drag to draw a circle.

00:10:10.295 --> 00:10:14.780
Okay, I'm gonna set the width and height to 35 like this.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.249
Let's make it white.

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:17.120
Pretty good.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.525
And now I'm gonna duplicate it will be to the right side.

00:10:20.525 --> 00:10:22.190
And in the layers list,

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.020
move this new shape,

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.390
which is the right circle down,

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.700
and put it below our first server.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:35.735
Okay, then select the second one and decrease the capacity from 100% to 75%.

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:36.755
Like this.

00:10:36.755 --> 00:10:39.170
I'm gonna move it to the left side a little bit.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.325
And there we go.

00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:41.540
I'm going to group them,

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.155
command your control G over them to the right side,

00:10:45.155 --> 00:10:51.455
it's right padding is going to be 40 and its bottom padding is going to be 40 as well.

00:10:51.455 --> 00:10:53.735
And we're going to zoom out a little bit,

00:10:53.735 --> 00:10:56.615
are right, so it looks fantastic.

00:10:56.615 --> 00:11:01.250
We could of course, modify our background a little bit to make it look even better.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.995
So I'm gonna select my shapes,

00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:05.975
these mass group, okay,

00:11:05.975 --> 00:11:09.020
hold down the Shift and control key on your keyboard,

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.850
or Shift and command key and select star one and star

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:18.904
three and move them to the right side a little bit and also down.

00:11:18.904 --> 00:11:20.825
Now I think it looks better, perfect.

00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:22.970
All right, so our credit card is ready.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.310
I'm gonna select all layers.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.750
Once again, group them,

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.930
and I'm gonna call it credit card. Perfect.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.590
The last thing we can do is add some drop shadow to it.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.325
Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and add effects to discard.

00:11:37.325 --> 00:11:41.120
I'm gonna open up defects settings and for its color,

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.430
I'm gonna use the eyedropper and choose the secondary dark color like this.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.105
And I'm gonna decrease the capacity to 15%.

00:11:50.105 --> 00:11:56.330
And finally, let's change the Blair amount to 100 and the Y2 50.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.385
There we go. We've just created a very great drop shadow for these credit card.

00:12:01.385 --> 00:12:02.555
It looks amazing.

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.595
All right, I think the line height of

00:12:04.595 --> 00:12:08.750
this title on the left side is a little bit too much.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:14.270
So what I'm gonna do is select this title and I'm going to detach it from its style.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:21.815
And then I'm going to decrease the line height from 150% to 120% like this.

00:12:21.815 --> 00:12:25.280
I'm gonna move it down to get a 30 pixel bottom margin.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.330
Okay, I'm gonna hold down the Shift key and select my description,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.215
group them, and I'm gonna name it feature one.

00:12:33.215 --> 00:12:36.665
And let's hold down the Shift key and select our credit card.

00:12:36.665 --> 00:12:38.630
Align them both vertically.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.570
Alright guys, now let's select both these groups.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:46.160
Group them, Control Z or Command Z and call it feature

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.920
one section and it's top margin is going to be 260 pixels.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.560
Okay, I'm gonna move it down like this.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.275
Are right. Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:12:57.275 --> 00:13:00.960
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.
