00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hi,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.880
everyone.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.980
And welcome back to another video of the scores in this video.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.050
We're going to design our transactions,

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.990
screen together.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.350
So without her,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.930
I do.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.240
Let's get a started.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.420
First of all,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.950
let me zoom in a little bit,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.280
and then I'm gonna insert a new art board.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.950
So let's press a on my keyboard and let's choose iPhone 11 pro or eggs.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.270
Pretty good.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.220
Let me move it to the left side.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.490
Fantastic.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.780
So what do we need for this page?

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.510
First of all,

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.590
we need a header.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.210
Okay,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.700
We a navigation bar at the top,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.840
and then we need some text layers.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.630
And after that,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.000
we need to create a floating card right at the bottom for our transactions.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.550
Okay,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.300
So let's go ahead and create a rectangle.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.070
I'm going to drag and drop.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.520
Make sure that this rectangle is inside your art board.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.350
And now let's rename our art for two transactions pretty good.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.190
Then I'm going to select this rectangle and let's set the high to 245 like this,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.230
and I'm going to double click on that in order to enter the edit moan and let's elect thes

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.000
two bottom knowns Because I'm gonna increase the corner radius to 62.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.160
That's Glicken done.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.930
And after that,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.200
I'm going to make those corners smooth.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.850
Okay,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.640
Fantastic.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.050
All right,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.630
So now let's go ahead and change the field,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.230
okay?

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.570
Actually,

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.310
I'm going to use the same Grady int as this rectangle,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.680
so let's go ahead,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.750
copy Properties,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.830
and I'm going to right click here and paste it pretty good.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.170
Now,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.680
let's copy and paste thes status far.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.940
I'm gonna copy this.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.920
Pace it here pretty good.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.250
And now it's time to create our navigation.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.860
More so for the navigation where we need a title.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.960
So let's inserted hex lawyer and try transactions.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.100
The front is going to be as of pro text and the font size should be 17 points and bold.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.700
Okay,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.450
then that Select it and make it white like this.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.600
Aligning to the center and also lets align it here are right now let's shake the pad ings

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.750
it Stop had until this frame,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.900
which is our status far should be five pixels like this.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.060
And the only thing we need to add in order to finish our navigation bar is a back Think air

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.060
.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.680
Okay,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.270
so let's go ahead and place an image.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.370
And from icons,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.880
you can insert these knave.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.800
Arrow icon.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.320
Okay,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.800
place it here pretty good.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.920
Now let's align it with our text vertically like this.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.170
And once again,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.540
we need to set the top.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.950
Adding to three d sime,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.950
not five.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.010
And the left padding should be 24 pixels like this.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.060
Pretty good.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.560
I'm gonna group them and it's right.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.950
Navigation bar.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.860
Okay.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.250
You can also create a component if you want to use it again and again.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.360
So as you can see right now,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.470
we have a navigation war component.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.280
Pretty good.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.350
Let me zoom out.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.050
So for these transactions,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.690
header,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.690
we need to have a title.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.520
That's right,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.050
your total expenses.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.470
And I'm going to change the fund to Monsour it.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.630
And also the font size to 22 points.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.410
Let's make it regular.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.330
Fantastic.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:25.020
I'm gonna align it to the center and it's change the font color to 87 f zero and double f

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.150
like this.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.150
Pretty good.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.830
It's a line to the center.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.550
Let's move it up a little bit.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.010
All right,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.870
it's top adding till our navigation bar should be 70 pixels like this duplicated moving

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.750
down.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.330
And here we need to write the amount of our expenses.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.820
Okay,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.030
so first of all,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.630
let's make it bold.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.750
And also,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.120
I'm gonna make it wind.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.200
And then that's increased the font size to Â£28.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.850
Okay.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.170
Make sure that it's aligned to the send her.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.390
And here,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.250
let's right.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.760
1000 and $63.630.30 like this.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.380
And the top hiding of thes amount should be 16 picks cells like these.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.090
Pretty good.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.420
So what else do we need?

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.450
I'm gonna go ahead and duplicate this rectangle,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.100
okay?

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.930
And move this layer right below our main rectangle.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.540
Okay?

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.660
And I'm gonna move it down by five.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.190
Peak cells as you can see the wine set to five now,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.480
and let's change its color to a solid one.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.270
And I'm gonna set the same we do that we used for these text layer.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.920
So let's write 87 f zero double f Pretty good.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.620
Our right.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.660
Our heather is done and everything is perfect.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.220
Now it's time to design our car.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.950
Okay,

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.620
so I'm gonna go ahead and select thes rectangle,

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.870
this blue one duplicated moving down.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.970
Then I'm gonna write kill here and Let's Philippine vertically like this pretty good on

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:02.270
let's set the high to 541 like this and allowing it to the bottom pretty good.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.370
The only thing I'm going to change is the direction off these Grady's.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.090
I'm going to change the place of these two colors like this,

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.470
and now everything is great.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.470
Then we need to have a home indicator.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.080
So let's go ahead and copy and paste this white one pretty good.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.890
And after that,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.780
we need to create an indicator that shows this card is movable.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.220
Okay,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.420
so I'm gonna go ahead and create a rectangle dragon dropped like this.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.540
I'm going to set the with 2 47 and a high to four like this,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.220
and I'm gonna make it round it completely.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.670
Make it white.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:41.780
Fantastic.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.700
And after yet,

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.630
let's align it to the center and the top hiding should be 16 pixels exactly like this.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.150
Okay,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.990
then we need to have a search bar.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.490
Okay,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.290
So instead of using some pre made Sarah's bars,

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.060
I'm going to show you how you can design your own customized search bar.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.630
Okay?

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.930
It's so simple for a search for we need a rectangle.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.360
I'm going to drag and drop like this.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.200
Let's sit there with 2 315 and a high to 53.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.970
And then I'm going to set the corner radius to 16 like this and make sure that they are

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:16.700
smooth,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.650
fantastic,

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.110
aligning to the center.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.020
And let's change the field color to something darker than this background.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.490
Okay,

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.190
in order to create a contrast.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.300
So that's right.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.480
05 199 and e pretty good.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.320
It's stop heading.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.720
Should be 24 pixels life days and now we need a tanks and an icon.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.160
Okay,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.220
so I'm gonna go ahead and place an image.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.930
Let's shoes search.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.040
Place it here.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.850
And I'm gonna lining to read our search bar vertically.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:52.560
Pretty good on its left padding should be 16 pixels like the top and bottom pad ings.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.390
And after that we need a text.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.890
So I'm going to write search and the font is going to be a safe pra rounded.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:00.530
Okay.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.810
And that's changed the color to the same color as our search icon with the help of

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.670
eyedropper.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.560
Pretty good.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:14.060
Aligning vertically without search far and it's left padding should be eight pixels like

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.550
this.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.650
Then let's select all of them.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.650
Group them and college search bar.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.000
Fantastic.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.690
So now it's time to add our transactions.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.220
Okay,

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.810
In order to make it easier,

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.820
I'm gonna go ahead and select these recent transactions that we created in the previous

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.460
video.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.880
So let's select all of them copied.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.250
Um,

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.790
and let's pace it in this screen,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.580
move them up pretty good.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.310
It stop heading.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.430
Should be 24 peaks.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.740
Cells like this.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.320
However,

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.410
we need to change the colors in order to make them visible.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:45.870
Okay,

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.250
So I'm gonna select all these titles,

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:48.980
shopping,

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.080
medicine and sport,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.650
and let's make them wind like this.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:08:01.200
And now let's select the date and time and let's set the color to 80 e zero double f like

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.680
this.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.140
I'm gonna copy this color.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.230
Then let's elect these arrows.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.000
However,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.690
remember to select the shape,

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.760
not this friend.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.350
Okay,

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.120
the shape is this one.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.530
So you can hold command key or control key on your keyboard and click on that that select

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.370
all of them.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.390
And I'm gonna pace the color code that we just copied like this.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.820
And last but not least,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.530
we need to select these amount X and let's make them want.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.950
Now it looks great.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.550
All right,

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.120
so now we need to add some more transactions to this car.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.600
All right,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:39.450
so let's go ahead and select these shopping transaction duplicated movie down like this and

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.790
make sure that its top heading East said to 16 pixels.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:51.870
Change the day to March 5 like this on the time to something like 7 20 and the amount to

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:57.840
$255 pretty good once again duplicated moving down.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.940
And this time I'm gonna make it different.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.420
Okay,

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.950
so let's go ahead and rename me to travel.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:08.350
And also let's change these title to travel as well,

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.840
and the amount should be $399.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:20.530
That's changed a day to Marsh three and a time to 5 50 Pretty good and the last dignity to

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.120
changes.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.790
Decipher.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.960
So let's remove these shopping icon.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:31.360
Select this circle and change the field to double F 87 87 like this,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.480
and I'm gonna place an image from transactions,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.350
and here we have travel.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.470
Put it here,

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.290
and it's aligned them to the center like this,

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.030
and that's renamed use icon to travel pretty good.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.690
All right.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.120
The last transaction should be sports,

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.320
so I'm going to duplicate it if you want to change them.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.800
It's totally up to you.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.670
You can go ahead and change the orders.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.410
The amounts that colors.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:03.870
You can play around with these screen nerd to get used to this suffer and the process of

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.300
designing a screen.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:05.780
Okay,

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.560
so the amount should be the same.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.180
However,

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.700
we need to change the date.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:17.550
So I'm gonna make it 10 off February and the time to 5 20 like this.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.430
Pretty good.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:19.660
Then let's go ahead and said,

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.340
Take all transactions,

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.940
group them,

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:28.520
and let's call it transactions like this.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.570
And now everything.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.600
