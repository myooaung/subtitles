00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
Hello,

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.900
Ruin.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.340
Welcome back to another video off this course in this video,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.630
we're gonna be talking about the Boolean operations.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.020
Actually,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.290
nowadays we use Boolean operations almost in every aspect of our life.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.150
Such as art programming design,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.050
etcetera.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.960
As difficult as it may sound,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.380
Actually,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.750
Boolean operations are so simple.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.510
So let's dive into it,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.340
and I'm gonna show you how you could use them easily.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.580
So,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.280
as you can see,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.500
I have created simple project here with four different art boards.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.710
And I call them Union,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.760
subtract,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.600
intersect and exclude.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.850
And these are our Boolean operators.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.360
Okay.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.890
Like as you can see here we have this menu and we have union selection.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.610
We have subtract selection.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.320
We have intersex election,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.090
and we have excludes election.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.580
Okay,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.650
so first of all,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.770
let me choose this art board and I'm gonna hold shift into like this.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.760
As you may guess,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.650
union means combining.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.370
Okay,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.160
If I try to overlap thes shape with this circle,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.920
as you can see,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.190
they have been overlapped.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.660
Okay,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.580
So if I choose the Boolean operations and I choose union operation,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.300
you can see that we have combined these two Ciric als into one single shape.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.170
And here you could,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.680
of course,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.280
get access to stop players like these circles,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.380
and you can steal edit it.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.220
However,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.950
we have one single shape and these operations are so useful for creating icons and we will

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.170
talk about it later.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.900
Are right.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.660
Now,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.830
let's go ahead and talk about the next operation,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.540
which is subtract.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.620
So first of all,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.580
let me overlap this shape like this and I'm going to choose.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.740
Subtract.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.020
And as you can see,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.250
it subtracts the overlapping section from the base shape.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.920
Okay,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.210
so the overlapping section is Theis part in the middle.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.810
So when I choose subtract,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.180
it removes thes overlapping section from this base shape,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.700
which is the left circle like this.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.990
So,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.810
as you can see,

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.680
the subtract operation is the opposite of union,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.310
okay?

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.240
And the next operation is intersect.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.590
So let me overlap these two layers like this,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.080
and I'm gonna click an intersex selection.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.350
And these operation removes all the areas except the overlapping section like this and the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.270
next operation,

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.530
which is the last one.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.130
It's called exclude,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.670
and it's the opposite of intersect operation.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.630
So if I overlap these two shapes like this and I click on Excludes Election.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.680
You can see that it keeps all the areas except the overlapping section.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.440
So did you see how simple it is to use Boolean operations there so useful now,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.060
don't you think it's a good idea to create some icons with this knowledge?

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.850
That's great.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.970
So first of all,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.350
I'm going to create another art board and I'm going to click A on my key words.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.070
That's Dragon dropped.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.780
Creates a new frame like this and suppose that we want to create a search icon.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.340
Okay,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.480
so what do we need?

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.780
We need a circle.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.250
So I'm going to create one,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.420
and I'm not gonna fill it with colors.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.020
I'm going to remove the feel.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.060
And at some stroke like this,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.790
I'm gonna increase the thickness of the stroke.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.100
Let me see.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.270
I think 15 is great,

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.700
and I'm going to create a rectangle as well with the with of 15 as well.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.340
And I'm going to change the color to black like this at the zoom in a little bit.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.750
I'm going to move it up,

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.800
Then let's elect both objects and align them to the center.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.010
And I'm going to choose union selection like this pretty good.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.750
Now I can rotate it.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.450
Awesome.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.180
Did you see how simple it is to create an icon with these Boolean operations?

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.040
Pretty good.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.360
I hope you liked it.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.350
Now let's create another icon.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.870
For instance,

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.640
Let's create Cloud Icon.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.470
I'm going to create a rectangle here like this and it's increased the radius pretty awesome

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.470
.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.930
And I need to create a circle as well like this.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.240
Let me overlap it pretty good.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.990
And then I'm going to select both off them and select union selection.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.930
And there we go.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.130
We have our cloud.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.060
So if I change the color to black,

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.030
you can see how amazing duties you can also customize it later or even for instance,

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.550
I can remove the feel.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.420
And I can add stroke like this if you prefer this kind of styling.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.150
But remember,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.460
when you're designing some icons for a specific project,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.760
you need to keep the thickness of your lines the same for each specific icon.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.680
In order to be consistent in your design are right,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.150
guys,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.430
Thank you so much writing this video I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.950
