00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Hi,

00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.900
everyone.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.220
And welcome back to another video of thes course in this video,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.720
we're going to add the typography style to our star invite.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.450
Okay,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.780
So without fair,

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.440
I do.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.050
Let's get started with duplicating this art word and I'm gonna call it typography.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.540
Then that means zoom in a little bit.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.150
And that's changed this title to typography as well.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.460
Fantastic.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.540
And after that,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.730
I'm going to remove these shadows and these borders as well.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.700
And let's change the title to age one.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.290
Okay,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.950
then I'm going to increase the with of this line to 1120 like this and after Dad,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.940
I'm going to duplicate these tanks like this pretty good.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.080
And let's change the font size to 34 points and I'm going to make it bold.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.110
Fantastic.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.840
Make sure that it is aligned to the left side like this,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.740
and I'm going to change.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.260
That takes two sample text pretty awesome.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.400
Then we need to duplicate it,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.750
and I'm gonna move it to the center of this art board.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.010
So let's line it to the center.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.990
Once again duplicated Fantastic.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.720
However,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.990
now let's elect this middle one,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.630
and we need to align into the center and the last one we need to aligning to the right side

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.630
.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.230
Okay,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.620
and now it's time to create our textile.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.130
Okay,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.720
so let's select the 1st 1 Anchalee Candies for dots and let's click on this icon And here

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.230
I'm going to write 81 slash left.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.190
Fantastic.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.340
The 2nd 1 is going to be age to slash center,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.370
and the last one is going to be age one slash right.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.450
Fantastic.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.020
Now let's rename these group to H one and this one as well.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.970
Let me rename this group as well to typography.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.690
And now let's duplicate these H one group like this,

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.660
and I'm going to rename the H one title to age two.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.180
And now let's detach thes takes from its style like this,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.350
this one as well and this one as well.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.790
And now it's time to select all of them,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.810
and I'm going to change the font size to 26 points.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.850
Fantastic!

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.990
And then we need to create our textile are right.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.850
As you can see,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.900
I made a mistake for this one.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.780
I wrote H two,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.520
so let's go ahead and change it because we need to write age one for these.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.290
And now let's select this one.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.130
And I'm going to create a new textile that's right,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.070
Age to left.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.350
I'm gonna copy that.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.040
And this one is going to be age too center.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.650
And the last one is going to be age too,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.060
right?

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.050
Fantastic.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.820
Now let's rename our group to age two as well.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.390
Okay,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.250
then we need to duplicate that like this,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.710
and let's change the title to H three and I'm going to detach these texts from their style

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.350
one by one.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.680
Okay,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.660
now let's select all of them,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.310
and I'm going to change the font size to 16 points.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.190
Fantastic.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.910
However,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.700
now I'm not going to create the textiles because I'm going to save your time.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.310
I will do it by myself,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.090
and you can download the finals.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.380
Time Guide from the Resource is lecture of thes section.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.910
Okay,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.510
so let's rename this group age three and once again duplicated,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.450
and it's going to be age for that.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.580
Select all these tanks and change the font size to 12 points.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.680
Fantastic!

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.600
And that's all for these video.
