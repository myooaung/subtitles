00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
Hello,

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:01.850
everyone.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.520
In this video,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.750
we're going to be talking about color contrast,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.000
which is a very important topic when it comes to you I designed.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.840
Applying colors effectively is a skill that everyone who works it,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.250
visual compositions must have so you,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.720
as a your designer into know how to use colors in your projects.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.750
When it comes to applying colors,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.620
readability and legibility are the key factors.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.280
Researchers have shown that vibrant colors enable enough of contrast,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.110
helping to increase readability and legibility.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.370
Please take into consideration that too much color contrast make us difficulty in reading.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.510
I highly recommend that designers should create a meat level of contrast and for

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.550
highlighting elements they can use high contrast ing colors.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.130
You can also use websites to provide you with a ratio when comparing two colors to see

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.880
whether there is enough contrast or not.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.890
If you look at the examples under right,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.040
we have six different colors.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.000
As you can see,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.450
the 1st 4 are acceptable and have enough contrast,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.750
but the others are not readable.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.840
So when we're designing a user interface,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.970
we need to pay attention to callers a lot because sometimes you as a designer,

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.130
I want to be as creative as possible.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.220
However,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.250
creativity should come after readability and legibility
