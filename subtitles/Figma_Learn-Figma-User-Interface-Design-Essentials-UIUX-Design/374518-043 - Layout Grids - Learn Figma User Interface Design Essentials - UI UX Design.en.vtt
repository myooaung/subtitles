00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
Hi,

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.880
everyone.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.780
Welcome back to another reading off this course in this video we're gonna be talking about

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.900
the layout greets,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.490
basically,

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.570
layout greets will help us to design precisely.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.630
So we can understand where exactly are objects should be placed or how you could place your

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.890
objects in different screen size.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.900
So in order to add a layout greed,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.140
you can head over to the properties panel or inspector,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.550
and right in the middle,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.970
you can see the layout greed section and I'm going to click.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.570
And these plus buttons like this and in the advanced setting you can set the size.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.370
For example,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.320
I can city to eight if I'm going to use it for designing mobile applications,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.630
and I can set it to 10.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.640
If I'm designing a webpage,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.830
you can also modify the color like this and the capacity.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.560
Of course,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.220
if you want to change the type of your layout greed,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.350
you can easily head over to these drop menu.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.130
And as you can see,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.050
we have three different options.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.530
The 1st 1 is greed,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.500
and this is what you can see here.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.260
The 2nd 1 is columns,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.870
and in this case you have more options to modify.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.860
For instance,

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.790
you have count,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.950
so it means the number of your columns that you want to use.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.680
If you're designing a webpage,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.130
you can set it to 12.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.060
It's the most famous layout greed for designing our page.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.900
Then you have type with and margin.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.690
The with is disabled because we're using the stretch type.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.490
So it basically means that it stretches all the 12 columns across our art board.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.130
So if I change it to center,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.450
you can see that the with will be enabled.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.350
So I can easily set the with 2 30 or even 60 like this.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.490
And it's center.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.050
Okay,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.440
The gotta amount is the space between columns and rows,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.110
and here you can set it to right.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.370
You can set it to left and stretch.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.480
So when should you use center?

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.160
For instance,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.540
if you're designing a webpage for an ultra wide screen,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.270
you can use this center option.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.530
You can also change it to rose.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.540
As you can see,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.800
the next important point that I'm going to mention is that layout grades do not depend on

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.320
the dimension of your artwork.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.290
So it means that if I try to resize this art board like this,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.090
you can see that your layout created will be intact.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.600
All right,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.910
guys,

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.530
that's all for this video.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.760
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.870
And I will see you in the next video.
