00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.470
Hi,

00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.010
everyone.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.220
And welcome back to another video of these course in this video,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.240
we're going to design our transfer screen together.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.110
So without for I do,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.570
let's get it started.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.820
First of all,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.140
I'm gonna go ahead and duplicate these transactions detail screen like this.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.450
Then let's rename me to transfer.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.700
Perfect.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.410
And after that,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.340
I'm going to remove almost all elements.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.850
Okay,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.420
so let's go ahead and select these cards.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.520
Remove them.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.760
This one as well.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.170
These two text layers as well.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.860
However,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.150
we need the home indicator.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.690
OK,

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.650
so we're going to copy and paste this black one that's copied and pasted here pretty good.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.230
And also,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.260
we need to have our navigation bar.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.790
Okay,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.150
So what I'm gonna do is selecting these two rectangles.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.070
Rectangle 15 and 16.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.880
Group them.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.840
Let's set the wine to minus 141.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.890
Fantastic.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.720
And that's changed these title to transfer pretty good.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.040
So what else do we need for these page?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.410
Actually,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.830
we need to have a text layer,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.780
So let's insert it.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.860
Takes layer here.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.350
I'm going to write enter amount like this.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.220
Then let's set the fund to Monsour it fantastic on.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.890
I'm going to make it regular.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.000
And also let's change the font size to 18 points pretty good.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.860
That's aligning to the center.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.100
And then let's change the color to 27.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.030
43 f d fantastic it stop hiding is going to be 75 pixels like this.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.460
Then let's duplicate it.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.660
Moving down.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.550
I'm gonna zoom mean and here we need to have the amount.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.820
So I'm going to write a dollar sign zero and let's make it bold.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.530
And also,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.490
I'm going to change the font size to 36 points pretty good.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.790
Then we need to change the color of this digit,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.130
Okay,

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.390
because now the user didn't enter any amount yet.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.210
So let's change it to be seeks be f f f fantastic.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.530
Aligning to the center and it stop heading is going to be 16 pick cells like this.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.270
Then we need a separator.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.950
So I'm gonna go ahead and create a line like this.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:27.330
Let's set the with 2 224 aligning to the center and let's change the stroke to the e one

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.400
and e f like this pretty good.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.960
It stop Fighting is going to be 16 pix Els Fantastic once again,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.990
let's duplicate these.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.490
Enter my own text layer moving down and I'm going to write to,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.580
and the top heading should be 16 pixels as well.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.980
Then that's duplicate it once again.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.530
Here,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.170
we need to write the name of the receiver.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.280
So that's right.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.380
Grace,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.420
Addison and the fun size should be 16 points.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.980
However,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.330
we need to change the color.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.800
23 a three a and three a.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.580
Pretty good.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.830
We need to have a profile image of this user as well.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.210
So let's go ahead and select these pro fine image car Pittis and paste it here.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.710
Pretty good movie down.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.780
Then I'm gonna choose the scale to.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.400
You can press K on your keyboard to select that,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.380
and that's scary.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.280
Down to get a 34 by 34 pizza profile image.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.180
I'm going to make it 34 by 34.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.700
Fantastic.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.290
Let me move it here.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.460
The wrong padding of these photo is going to be eight pixels.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.310
Then let's use the text layer and I'm gonna align it vertically pretty good.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.120
However,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.640
we need to change this photo.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.150
OK,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.480
so I'm going to double click on that to choose thes photo then let's go ahead and run our

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.050
content.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.820

Align it to the center and it's stop patting is going to be 16 pig cells pretty all right.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.350
The next thing we need to create is our Nam Pat.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.900
OK,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:14.490
so I'm going to create a rectangle on Let's set there with 2 89 and a high to 70 like this

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.490
,

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.020
and I'm going to change the corner radius to 17.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.720
However,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.920
make sure to make those corners smooth by the slider.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.990
Fantastic.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.920
After that,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.380
we need to change the Bagram color.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.340
So let's write a five F six and f A pretty good at Mizzou.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.850
Me.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.720
So here we need to insert a text layer,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.100
so I'm going to write one.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.810
However,

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.690
we need to change the fund to us of pro text like this.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.830
Make it medium,

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.920
and the fund size should be 24 points.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.800
And lastly,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.600
let's change the color to turn to seven for your three and f d.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.230
Pretty good.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.410
I'm gonna align it to the center both vertically and horizontally.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.650
And make sure that your text layer is allowing to the center as well here.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.200
Okay,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.310
then let's group them.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.350
I'm gonna call it one duplicated moving to the right side.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.370
The distance between them is going to be 10 pixels.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.380
That's duplicated once again.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.770
Select all of them,

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.890
duplicate them,

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.920
move them down pretty good once again and once again.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.970
Fantastic.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.460
And let's go ahead and change.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.620
These takes layers.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.550
One by one,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.860
it's gonna be too.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:37.450
3456789 And this one is going to be a dot And here we're gonna have zero,

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.000
and the last one is going to be changed.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.940
So let's remove this text layer.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.770
I'm going to select all of them,

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.650
grouped them and let's call it.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.330
No,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.590
I'm part fantastic aligning to the center on.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.710
Let's move it up a little bit.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.150
So for this one first,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.100
I'm going to change its color because this is our sand button.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.540
Okay,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.250
so I'm going to use the same radiant as we used for our header.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.720
So let's choose this rectangle rectangle 15.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.690
Right Click on that and copy the properties like this.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.920
I'm going to paste it here pretty good at Mizzou mean,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.480
then we need to insert a right are icon.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.760
So let's place an image and from Icons folder I'm going to choose the right arrow.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.660
Place it here pretty good.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.780
Then let's go ahead and scale it like this.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.510
I think now it's great.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.430
Let's align it to the center.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.590
Fantastic.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.550
Then let's rename this group to send pretty good.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.260
The bottom padding of this non pad is going to be 74.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.780
Picks elves like this and the right and left padding.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.910
They're going to be 44 p cells and now everything is done.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.100
It's pretty amazing,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.730
isn't it?

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.580

that's on for these video.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.740
We have successfully created our transfer page together.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.120
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.450
And I will see you in the next video.
