00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.420
Hi,

00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.980
everyone.

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.850
And welcome back to another video of these course in these video,

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.440
we're gonna be talking about components.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.930
Basically,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.590
components are reusable elements.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.120
Okay,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.580
so you can create them once and you can use them multiple times.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.140
It's pretty amazing.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.400
So they're like symbols in sketch.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.840
So without further I do.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.100
Let's get it started.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.120
First of all,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.170
I'm gonna go ahead and create a bottom.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.240
So I need a rectangle.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.150
I'm going to drag and drop.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.850
Let's set the with 2 270 a high to 70 like this.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.470
And then I'm gonna increase the corner radius to 20.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.690
Pretty awesome.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.550
I think it's a good idea to change the color as well.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.560
I'm gonna set it to this color.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.390
Cody's 35 62 double F,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.450
and then I need a text.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:04.810
So let's write primary and I'm going to choose the SF Pro text bond and the weight of

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.270
medium and its size is going to be 20 points.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.820
Okay,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.600
then that's changed the color to white.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.090
In order to have a good contrast here,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.970
I'm going to select my elements,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.550
aligning to the center both vertically and horizontally and now Let's group them.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.570
I'm gonna call it Barton slash Primary,

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.720
and I think it's a good idea to add photo layout to this button.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.830
So I'm gonna press shift in a And as you can see,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.150
the totaling out has been added to this part.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.880
Okay,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.100
the next thing we need to do is to click on this icon inner to create our component.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.790
So if I click on that,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.530
it's done.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.810
I just created my first component.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.250
You can also add a description to your component here so I can write.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.270
It's the primary bottom like this.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.480
And now how can you reuse this button?

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.460
It's so simple.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.280
Do you remember that in layers pain?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.120
We had the assets section.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.410
Now,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.650
if you open it up,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.130
you can see that in local components we have are created components here,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.150
So if I want to use that,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.550
I can easily dragon drop it.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.600
And if I hover on top of that,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.450
you can see the description that we just wrote.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.710
So there we go,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.010
and because I added the totally outed,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.200
I can easily change these tanks,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.210
for instance,

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.650
Let's right get started and its size will dynamically change pretty awesome.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.780
But what if you want to change some properties off these instance?

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.330
Okay,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.730
actually,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.640
this button is an incense off this master button.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.170
So we call this button the master component,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.490
and this button is an instance of these master components.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.980
Okay,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.750
So if you want to change some properties off that,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.910
for instance,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.670
if you want to change the color,

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.410
you can easily head over to feel section and you can change it.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.610
And as you can see,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.160
nothing happens to the master component.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.630
Okay.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.280
However,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.910
if you try to change the master component,

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.300
it will affect all of its instances.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.020
So in the inspector section,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.890
you have the instant section here and here You have a drop menu,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.980
and I'm gonna show you how you can use that.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.500
But if you want to go to the master component,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.100
you can use thes spartan like this.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.200
And now we are in master component.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.090
So here,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.290
if I try to change the color,

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.400
you can see that it's instance will change immediately,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.220
or if I increase the corner radius here,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.560
you can see that it applies to its instances immediately.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.410
So I'm gonna set it back to 20 now Let's create another button.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.600
So I'm gonna choose this primary one.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.290
I'm going to duplicate it like this,

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.060
and before making any changes here,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.410
we need to detach it from its incense.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.810
Okay,

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.820
so first we need to click and detach incense.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.560
And now,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.580
if I change it,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.050
nothing happens to the previous button.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.930
So let's change the opacity to 75%.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.620
And this one is going to be the hover states off our previous button.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.090
Okay,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.040
so I'm gonna go to layers list and let's change the name to button,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.830
hover and click on create component,

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.650
and that's done.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.250
So now,

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.510
if I select this getting started button and I go to these drop menu in the instant section

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.510
,

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.920
I can go to Button.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.370
Of course,

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.390
you have related components here.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.070
However,

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.100
because I use slash when I name them,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.010
I could put all those buttons into these group button.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.550
Okay,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.700
so now I can change it from Primary Toe Harbor and there we go.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.730
It was so simple.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.110
So now let's go ahead and add some effects to this button.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.900
So I'm going to choose the master component and then click on this plus button in effect

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.450
section and here we have drop shadow.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.390
So I'm gonna go to the advance section and let's choose the same color here.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.730
And let's change its capacity to 15% Very well.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.420
I'm going to change the Blair amount to 20.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.160
End of why amount to 10 X is going to be zero.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.620
Okay,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.670
it's pretty awesome.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.860
So let's create another bottom here as well.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.770
I'm going to duplicate it.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.250
Then I'm going to detach it from its master component.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.030
And then that's changed capacity to 25%.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.790
And I'm going to remove this drop shadow because it's going to be our disabled state.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.860
So now I'm going to rename it to button slash the say Bell three denies,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.740
and could you can create components and it's done.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.800
So if I just said like this get started button and I go to these drop menu,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.860
I can easily choose disable.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.780
It was so easy,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.440
wasn't it?

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.040
You can make almost everything a component.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.530
Okay,

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.720
so,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.610
for instance,

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.220
we can go ahead and create a text field.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.870
I'm going to select the line and its dragon drop pretty good here we have created a line.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.920
Let's choose the same color as our watan.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.980
Pretty nice.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.020
I'm gonna increase the thickness off our line.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.770
22 Fantastic.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.820
Let's change the with 2 350 we need a text year.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.050
So I'm going to write Text Field.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.870
Pretty denies.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.960
And let's change its color to this fun.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.260
And I'm going to set the top heading of this line to eight pixels like this.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.310
And let's move these takes a little bit to the right,

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.210
pretty awesome.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.050
And I think it's better to decrease the opacity of these texts to 50%.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.940
Fantastic.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.230
Now let's group them.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.890
I'm going to call it Thanks,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.430
field slash active,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.100
and let's create a components out of this pretty good.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.670
However,

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.650
make sure to align your takes to the left like this could also add totally out to this.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.490
But for the purpose of this video,

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.270
I'm gonna live it capacities.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.900
Now let's duplicate it.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.570
I'm going to detach it from its master,

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.250
and then let's change the color to something like this,

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.040
okay?

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.380
And this one as well,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.590
and it's going to be 50%.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.100
This one is going to be the error state,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.150
so let's change its name to error,

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.180
and I'm going to create a component.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:23.280
So now if I goto assets in local components Micro One,

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.290
we can see that I have text field and here I can use it easily.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.730
Let's change it to my name.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:30.280
OK,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.150
Pretty awesome.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.700
And if I want to change it to the error state,

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.500
I can changes here easily.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.750
There we go,

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.490
so you could make your card as a component.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.640
Your buttons you're takes feels your sliders,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.900
every single thing,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.250
and it's so useful and powerful,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.960
and it's gonna accelerate your design process.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.470
So now we have created our components,

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.040
and we can use them locally.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.780
However,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.490
if you want to share these components with your teammates,

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:04.690
you can easily head over to Asset Section and you can click and these icon team library.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.450
And here you have the ability to publish your car and file the other team members,

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.340
and then they can use all these components in other projects and other files,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.450
which is pretty cool.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:20.870
Keep in mind that we're going to practice all these knowledge in the futures lessons

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.470
because we're going to create our own real world projects based on these knowledge.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.440
So don't worry if you don't understand every single thing here.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.140
It's totally normal and you're going to learn it by practice.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.170
So I hope you enjoy this video.

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:36.950
Thank you so much for watching it.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.150
And I will see you in the next video.
