00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
Hello,

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.810
everyone.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.810
Welcome back to another video off thes section in this video.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.000
We're going to talk about textures and materials when you're designing a three D object for

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.940
sure you need a tax share or material.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.350
As I mentioned before,

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.160
you have a library right at the top.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.480
So let's go ahead and click on that.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.630
And here you have different options.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.460
Here we have collections.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.830
We have a collection of different shapes,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.310
as it can see here,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.760
we can use these shapes like this or this one.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.740
And we have other options as well,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.160
such as assets.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.580
You have plenty off three D assets and then we have materials.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.080
Okay,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.020
so suppose that we want to change the material off our text here.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.500
Okay,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.700
so here we can choose one of these materials.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:59.770
I'm going to go for this one so you can drag and drop it on your three d text like this.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.750
That's pretty cool,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.410
isn't it?

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.720
It's.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.200
Render it once again and you can see the difference.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.700
Can you see how amazing Getty's you can easily change the material as you wish.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.580
So let's change it to something else.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.650
For instance,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.160
this one So you can choose your text and click on that.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.150
Perfect.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.130
Or it's better to create another shape.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.530
Here.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.210
Let's create a blocks here.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.090
I'm going to scale it down.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.250
Let's move it.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.740
You're perfect.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.440
And then I'm going to change its material to something else.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.010
Okay.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.460
For instance,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.500
this one It's pretty cool,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.090
isn't it?

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.400
Can you recognize how many possibilities there are for you to create amazing objects there

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.400
?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.820
That is fantastic.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.260
All right,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.590
guys,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.930
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.080
And I will see you in the next video.
