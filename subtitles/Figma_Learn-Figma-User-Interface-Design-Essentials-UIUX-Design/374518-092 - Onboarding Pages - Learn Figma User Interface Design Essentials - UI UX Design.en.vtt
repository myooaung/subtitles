And welcome to the last video off this section.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.900
In these video,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.730
we're going to design our own boarding pages together.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.310
Actually,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.060
we need to design three different pages that illustrate most important features of thes

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.880
application.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.400
Okay,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.210
so with us,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.080
for I do,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.260
let's get it started by inserting and you aren't board.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.160
So I'm gonna press a on my key world on Let's use an iPhone 11 pro or ex.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.030
Im gonna place it here on Let's rename me to On Boarding One.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.230
So what else do we need for December?

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.780
Actually,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.850
we need to place the logo or icon of this application first.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.340
Let's go ahead and bring it from here.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.340
I'm gonna covetous and paste it pretty good.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.020
However,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.970
I'm going to remove this title.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.450
Okay?

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.540
I don't need that.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.520
And then let's one group it to get a great frame.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.480
Fantastic.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.160
I'm gonna align you to the center and it's stop hiding is going to be 84 so let's move it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.600
up.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.300
However,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.730
we need to change the X value to 167 and avoid value to 80.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.420
And now,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.250
as you can see,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.890
we've got an 80 pizza how padding.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.430
Let's make it 84 like this.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.880
Now everything is great.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.050
Then we need to place an illustration here.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.600
Okay,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.610
so let's go ahead and place our illustration illustrations.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.480
The 1st 1 is going to be this saving place it here.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.420
I'm gonna line it to the center and it's stop patting is going to be 45 like this,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.980
Then here,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.540
I'm gonna place a circle.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.100
Okay,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.910
so let's create one.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.790
And when a dragon drop it on,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.840
let's change the color code to F five F six and f A like this,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.410
however,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.660
make sure that these circle is inside your art board Pretty good.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.280
I'm going to change their with and high to 470 on.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.960
Let's set the X Tu minus 125 Onda y to 423.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.680
Pretty good.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.710
Then we need to have a title,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.900
a description,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.040
a page indicator and a next button.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.510
Okay,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.500
so let's insert the text here and right.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.760
Save your money.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.760
Convenience E.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.100
Then I'm going to change the fund.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.810
Two months.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.310
Air it.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.060
It's gonna be bold and the fun size should be 24 points.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.010
Then I'm going to change the color to 27 43 f d.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.360
And then let's resize it to get something like this.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.150
However,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.640
I'm going to set the hide line to 36 to make it more risible,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.660
that miso mean.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.050
And I'm going to set the X 2 30 to get a 30 pixel left padding and a Y to 488.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.820
Pretty good,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.200
then duplicated moving down.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.950
And this time I'm going to change the fund to Assef Pro Text.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.450
Make it regular and the fun site should be 18 points.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.020

Let's change a line high to 28.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.400
Pretty good.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.810
I'm gonna move it down.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.260
Its top hiding should be 22 pixels like this are right now.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.920
It's time to create our page indicator.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.410
Okay,

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.410
so let me zoom in a little bit.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.120
I need to have a rectangle,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.370
so let's drag and drop to create a rectangle it's with is going to be 22 any time.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.730
It should be five like this.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.000
Let's make it completely around it,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.580
and I'm going to change the color to to a 46 on double left.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.320
Pretty good.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.720
Let's duplicate it.

Movie to the right side,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.210
and the padding between them should be four pixels.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.910
Get a circle five by five,

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:04.780
then let's change the color to be five b f f f Pretty good once again duplicated movie to

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.100

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.240
Fantastic.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.080
The last thing we need to create is our next bottle that hopefully we can go ahead and copy

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.330

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.380
I'm going to copy this and let's face it here,

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.760
I'm gonna move it down.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.280
Then that changed these text to next.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.290
