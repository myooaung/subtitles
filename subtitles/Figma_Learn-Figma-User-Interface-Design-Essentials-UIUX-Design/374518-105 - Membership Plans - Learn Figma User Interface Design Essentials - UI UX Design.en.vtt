00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.785
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:07.080
In this video, we are going to start designing our membership plans section.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.680
Okay, so let's take a look at our wireframe.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.824
As you can see for this section,

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:14.850
we need to have a title,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.290
subtitle and too tall cards, okay.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.735
And each card is going to have some information about that particular membership,

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:27.285
such as name, price,

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:28.589
a call to action,

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.784
or let's say registration button,

00:00:31.784 --> 00:00:35.714
the credit card, and the benefits of that particular membership.

00:00:35.714 --> 00:00:36.370
Okay.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.550
First of all, we need to create a text layer for our tidal.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.595
So I'm going to press T on my keyboard and click here.

00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:49.085
And let's write an exceptional service at the right price.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:53.690
I'm going to select this takes layer and let me choose our h.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.720
Three are heading three like this,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.525
and I am going to align it to the center horizontally.

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:00.170
Perfect.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.150
What about the color for the color?

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.155
I'm gonna use two colors for these takes layer, ok,

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:12.155
I'm going to select at the right price and choose our accent color for this.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:16.804
And the rest is going to have our primary color. Perfect.

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:19.175
It's good. Then I'm gonna duplicate it.

00:01:19.175 --> 00:01:21.845
Command your control v or v down.

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:24.215
And for the subtitle, I'm going to write,

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:29.780
start with our free plan and switch to premium as you grow, okay, like this.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.295
And for these takes layer,

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:34.640
I'm gonna choose by the intro like this.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.855
And for the color,

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:40.310
we can choose secondary dark and make sure to align it horizontally to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.470
the center and its top margin is going to be 20 pixels like this.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.930
Perfect. Now we need to create our cars,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.010
but before that, we need to increase the height of our landing page.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:59.360
So make sure to select your art board and increase it to 6,100 like this.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.850
So we have enough room to work with our right.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.384
I'm gonna zoom mean our right first,

00:02:04.384 --> 00:02:06.545
let's draw a rectangle,

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:09.050
okay, for our cart like this.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.475
And I'm going to set the width to 430 and the high to 1131.

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:20.270
Okay, like this, I already calculated it because I

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.990
already designed this project so I know the height I'm going to need.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.160
But if you want to design a project and you don't know how to calculate it,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.290
you just need to modify these amounts multiple times as your design goes on.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.755
Okay?

00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:36.575
So for example, suppose you have something like this

00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:39.815
and you add more content to it and you need more space,

00:02:39.815 --> 00:02:44.675
then you will increase the height again and again till you get the hide size you need.

00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:46.085
Alright, for these card,

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:50.090
we're going to use the same styling that we used for these cards.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.460
Okay, in order to copy the styling,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.270
I'm gonna hold down the control key on my keyboard or command

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.025
key and click on these car to select these particular rectangle.

00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:03.500
Okay, Alternatively, you can head over to

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.935
the layers list on the left side and look for this rectangle.

00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:13.055
Then right-click on that and go to copy and paste and copy properties.

00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:13.790
Okay.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.970
I'm going to scroll down, select these rectangle,

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.015
right-click on that and paste properties.

00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:20.870
And there we go.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.955
We've just copied and pasted all the styles that we added to our cards before.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.620
And this is exactly what we want.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.895
We have the stroke,

00:03:28.895 --> 00:03:30.125
we have the drop shadow.

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:31.400
Everything looks great.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.960
Alright, so what do we need?

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.535
First of all, at the top,

00:03:34.535 --> 00:03:36.035
we need the name, okay,

00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:39.770
so I'm going to press T on my keyboard and add it takes layer.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.020
And here let's write free, okay,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.010
and then I'm gonna change the text style to h three.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.560
However, we don't need it to be bold,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.870
so I'm going to detach it from its style and change it to regular.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.070
Then make sure that it's aligned to the center of your cards.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.315
So you need to hold down the Shift key,

00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:03.500
select these texts layer and your card and head over to

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.630
the Alignments section in the inspector and align it horizontally like this.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.960
All right.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.940
Now it's exactly in the middle.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.735
It's top padding is going to be 60 pixels duplicated.

00:04:14.735 --> 00:04:19.040
Command your control Lee movie down here we need to write the price.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.730
Okay?

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.125
I'm gonna write dollar sign 0 slash m,

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:25.760
which means per month,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.875
all right, for this amount, okay,

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:29.345
dollar sign and 0,

00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:32.195
I'm gonna set the font size to 60.

00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:37.010
And this slash M are going to use the same font size 40,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.945
okay, so we don't need to change that.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:43.445
Makes sure to align it with the card to the center, like this.

00:04:43.445 --> 00:04:47.735
And it's top padding is going to be 50 pixels, okay, like this.

00:04:47.735 --> 00:04:48.575
What else?

00:04:48.575 --> 00:04:50.855
After that we need to have a description.

00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:53.735
So I'm gonna duplicate it movie down.

00:04:53.735 --> 00:04:57.110
Let's set the alignment of our texts layer to center.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.630
Okay, it's easier to modify it later.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.205
And here I'm going to write,

00:05:01.205 --> 00:05:04.849
manage your business with a simple and efficient account.

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.060
So I'm just going to copy and paste it from my clipboard.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.215
For this, I'm going to choose by the main

00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:16.595
and its color is going to be secondary light like this.

00:05:16.595 --> 00:05:23.795
You can set the width to 340 and make sure to align it to the center horizontally.

00:05:23.795 --> 00:05:29.615
So always you need to select your layer and your card and then align them.

00:05:29.615 --> 00:05:32.629
It stopped padding is going to be 30 pixels.

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:33.995
And so far so good.

00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:37.820
After these description, we need to have a button.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.474
So I'm going to create a Getting Started button.

00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:42.305
I'm going to need a rectangle.

00:05:42.305 --> 00:05:44.675
So click and drag like this.

00:05:44.675 --> 00:05:49.550
The width of this rectangle is going to be 170 and the height,

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.150
I'm going to set it to something 54 pixels,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.820
okay, and then I'm gonna make it rounded it.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.300
So let's increase the corner radius amount to 20.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.255
And finally, let's make it an outline button.

00:06:02.255 --> 00:06:05.480
So I'm going to remove the feel and add a stroke to it.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.810
I'm going to set the thickness to 1.5 and

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.935
the color is going to be secondary dark like this.

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:16.025
Then add the text layer and that's right, get started.

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:17.495
For these texts layer,

00:06:17.495 --> 00:06:21.815
I'm going to use caption and also for its color.

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:24.035
I'm gonna use secondary dark.

00:06:24.035 --> 00:06:28.880
Okay, finally, we need to align these rectangle with our

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.785
Getting Started takes layer both horizontally and vertically and group them.

00:06:33.785 --> 00:06:35.615
Command Z or Control g,

00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:37.925
let's call it get started,

00:06:37.925 --> 00:06:42.275
okay, and I'm going to align it with my card horizontally.

00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:45.815
There we go. It stopped hiding is going to be 30 pixels.

00:06:45.815 --> 00:06:47.345
Okay, so far, so good.

00:06:47.345 --> 00:06:51.020
What's next? Next we need to have our credit card ok,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.060
we don't need to design it once again,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.550
since we designed it's already,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.060
let me just select these credit card, copy it,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.035
and scroll down and paste it right here.

00:07:03.035 --> 00:07:06.200
I'm going to press a key on my keyboard to select

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.985
the scale tool and try to scale it down like this are right,

00:07:10.985 --> 00:07:12.320
I think it looks good.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.970
Align it to the center.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.915
Alright, its top padding is going to be 40 pixels.

00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:19.820
And right under these cars,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.200
we need to create

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.330
two different circles to let the user choose between two different designs.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.555
Ok, so I'm gonna select the ellipse tool,

00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:35.105
click and drag, and let's set the width and height to 30, like this.

00:07:35.105 --> 00:07:37.745
Alright, so we're going to have two different designs,

00:07:37.745 --> 00:07:40.340
the dark version and the light version,

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.635
okay, to indicate the dark version,

00:07:42.635 --> 00:07:45.635
we're going to use two different colors here are

00:07:45.635 --> 00:07:51.125
secondary dark color and this light purple color that we used for our credit card.

00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:52.715
So let me zoom in.

00:07:52.715 --> 00:07:55.010
I'm gonna choose a rectangle,

00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:02.240
click and drag like this to feel half of our circle and choose our secondary dark color.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.135
Make sure to select this circle duplicated,

00:08:05.135 --> 00:08:07.745
wildly, duplicated layer is selected.

00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:11.435
Hold down the Shift key and select this rectangle that

00:08:11.435 --> 00:08:15.380
we just created and click-on mask like this.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.665
Then choose your initial circle, which is this one,

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:22.895
and change its color to these light purple.

00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:24.889
I'm going to choose the eye dropper.

00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:26.630
There we go, r, right?

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.685
So our mass group is ready.

00:08:28.685 --> 00:08:32.180
You need to make sure to select both these layers.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.595
Make sure to select both your initial circle and you're mass group and group them.

00:08:37.595 --> 00:08:39.425
And let's call it dark,

00:08:39.425 --> 00:08:43.655
move it up and it's top padding is going to be 20 pixels,

00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:46.640
okay, duplicated, moving to the right side.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.145
And now we need to modify the color.

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:51.200
So let me zoom mean I'm going to select

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.750
this dark rectangle and change its color to this light purple,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:02.450
and then select our initial circle and change its color to this lighter color.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.475
Okay, at the top, there we go.

00:09:04.475 --> 00:09:10.295
The last thing we need to do is put a stroke around this dark circle, okay?

00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:14.630
Because we need to somehow indicate that this dark version is selected.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.615
And if the user clicks on this light one,

00:09:17.615 --> 00:09:20.330
that stroke should appear around the Assyria.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.125
Well, first of all, let me rename this troop to light.

00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:28.295
And then I'm going to create another circle.

00:09:28.295 --> 00:09:29.720
Hold down the Shift key,

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.430
click and drag like this and put it right under the dark group,

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.130
removed a feel at a stroke to it,

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.070
and we need to align it with our inner circle.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.965
Okay, so I'm gonna make it a little bit smaller.

00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:50.105
So if I set it to 36 by 36 pixels and hold down the Option or Alt key on my keyboard.

00:09:50.105 --> 00:09:54.994
You can see that we've got a 3pq cell padding from all sides,

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:57.035
and this is exactly what we need.

00:09:57.035 --> 00:10:03.290
Alright, so let's group them and I'm gonna call it selected theme, okay?

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:09.320
And the left padding of this light theme is going to be ten pixels like this.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.800
Pretty good, but they are not aligned to the center of these cards.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.285
So what we need to do is hold down the Shift key and select both of them,

00:10:17.285 --> 00:10:18.935
like this, group them.

00:10:18.935 --> 00:10:23.585
And here I'm going to call it themes and hold down the Shift key,

00:10:23.585 --> 00:10:26.660
click on our credit card and align

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.575
them to the center horizontally and now they are in the center.

00:10:30.575 --> 00:10:34.325
All right, the next section is the benefits of this membership.

00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:40.205
Okay, so we need to have an icon on the left side and a text layer right next to it.

00:10:40.205 --> 00:10:44.315
Please open up the assets folder and open up the icons folder.

00:10:44.315 --> 00:10:46.474
And here you have some icons.

00:10:46.474 --> 00:10:51.155
Please choose the check icon and drag and drop it into your project.

00:10:51.155 --> 00:10:51.830
There we go.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.880
I'm gonna zoom mean let's press T and create a text layer.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.930
For the first benefit,

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.190
I'm gonna write ten free local transfers and

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.810
then I'm gonna set the text style to medium like that.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:11.615
Let me align it with my check icon vertically and it's left padding,

00:11:11.615 --> 00:11:17.105
It's going to be ten pixels and the colors should be secondary dark,

00:11:17.105 --> 00:11:19.310
like this. Alright, pretty cool.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.080
Now let's select both of them.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.410
Hold down the Shift key and click on your check icon,

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.935
group them and I'm gonna name it benefits,

00:11:27.935 --> 00:11:30.155
duplicate it, moving down.

00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:32.090
And here for the second feature,

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:38.630
I'm going to write free ATM withdrawals in dollar up to $250 per month.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:43.325
Okay, I'm going to copy and paste it from my clipboard to save some time.

00:11:43.325 --> 00:11:44.045
There we go.

00:11:44.045 --> 00:11:51.350
However, I need to decrease its width from 400 pixels, 2316 pixels.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.525
Okay, to get something like this,

00:11:53.525 --> 00:11:57.080
fantastic, then I'm gonna duplicate it will be down.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.835
And here I am going to write free payments to other draft accounts.

00:12:01.835 --> 00:12:03.860
Let me paste it. There we go.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.435
Make sure to align them.

00:12:05.435 --> 00:12:08.210
Once again, duplicated movie down here,

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.435
I'm going to write prepaid debit cards, okay,

00:12:11.435 --> 00:12:15.245
once again, duplicated movie down here.

00:12:15.245 --> 00:12:17.405
Let's ride reassured cards.

00:12:17.405 --> 00:12:18.470
Fantastic.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.140
Once again duplicated or weed down.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.960
And here I'm going to write priority

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:30.155
24-7 support like this k. We need to write two more benefits.

00:12:30.155 --> 00:12:34.625
For this one, I'm going to write Exchange 24 currencies.

00:12:34.625 --> 00:12:36.125
And for the last one,

00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:39.005
I'm gonna write multi-user axis.

00:12:39.005 --> 00:12:40.130
All right, pretty good.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.470
Now we need to set the spacing between them.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.280
So I'm gonna hold down the Shift key and select all of them like

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.675
this and this tribute vertical spacing.

00:12:50.675 --> 00:12:54.935
And I'm gonna set the padding between them to 20 pixels,

00:12:54.935 --> 00:12:58.970
like this, group them and call it benefits,

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.265
okay, select your rectangle,

00:13:01.265 --> 00:13:02.525
which is your card.

00:13:02.525 --> 00:13:07.865
Align it to the center and select your benefits group will be.

00:13:07.865 --> 00:13:11.855
It's top padding is going to be 40 pixels,

00:13:11.855 --> 00:13:15.350
like this, and its bottom padding is going to be 40 pixels.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.405
As we also, as I mentioned before,

00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:20.330
you can modify the height whenever you want.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.315
And as you can see now it's set to 41.

00:13:23.315 --> 00:13:26.810
So if I set the high 21126,

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:30.425
I can get 40 pixel padding from the bottom like this.

00:13:30.425 --> 00:13:31.640
Alright, so far, so good.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.650
The last thing we need to do is disable these last three benefits, okay?

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.725
Because this free membership is going to have

00:13:39.725 --> 00:13:44.045
all these features except these last three benefits, okay?

00:13:44.045 --> 00:13:46.325
These are available in the premium membership.

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:49.100
I just need to change your colour to a light gray.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.860
Okay, so I'm gonna select this takes layer,

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.645
detach it from its style and change the color code to b seven,

00:13:56.645 --> 00:13:59.990
b seven, and b seven, like this.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.160
I'm going to copy these color codes and select my check icon.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.335
And in the selection color section,

00:14:06.335 --> 00:14:08.255
I'm going to paste it. There we go.

00:14:08.255 --> 00:14:13.250
I'm gonna repeat the same process for other benefits like this.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.290
All right, we are done with our free card,

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:20.585
but one thing that I notice is that we said the top padding to 60 pixels.

00:14:20.585 --> 00:14:24.665
So we need to have a 60 pixel bottom padding as well.

00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:27.455
However, as you can see, it's set to.

00:14:27.455 --> 00:14:31.550
So what I'm gonna do is select the rectangle and I'm gonna

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.420
go ahead and just add 20 more pixels to the height.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:40.355
So what I can do is write plus 20, like this.

00:14:40.355 --> 00:14:43.175
And now the bottom padding is set to 60.

00:14:43.175 --> 00:14:44.990
So what about the premium cars?

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.590
First, we need to select all these elements like this.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.920
Click and drag to select all of them, group them.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.720
And here let's write free plan,

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.345
then duplicate it will be to the right side.

00:14:56.345 --> 00:15:00.020
The padding between them is going to be 30 pixels like this.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.850
And we need to modify something here.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:06.290
First, we need to modify the group name before we forget dad,

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.455
let's modify to premium plan.

00:15:09.455 --> 00:15:11.705
Then we need to modify the name.

00:15:11.705 --> 00:15:14.120
Obviously, let's change Free to premium.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.560
But before that, makes sure to align the text layer to the center,

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.144
ok, so that it stays at the center premium.

00:15:22.144 --> 00:15:24.950
The price is going to be a dollar.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.215
The description needs to be changed.

00:15:27.215 --> 00:15:29.930
So I'm gonna change it to a priority support and

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.785
multi-user access to maximize your productivity.

00:15:33.785 --> 00:15:36.905
So let me paste it from my clipboard. There we go.

00:15:36.905 --> 00:15:42.650
I'm going to scroll down and now we need to make these last three options available.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:47.209
So what we should do is select all these takes layers,

00:15:47.209 --> 00:15:52.625
hold down the Shift key and click on all of them and choose secondary dark,

00:15:52.625 --> 00:15:57.425
and then select your check icon and change its color to your primary color.

00:15:57.425 --> 00:15:58.310
Predict good.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.825
It so simple, isn't it?

00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:03.080
The premium card is ready as well.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.235
We are almost done,

00:16:04.235 --> 00:16:08.390
but we need to remember to align our cards to the centre.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.865
So let's select both of them, group them,

00:16:10.865 --> 00:16:14.900
and here I'm going to call it plans and just head

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.280
over to the Alignments section and align it horizontally to the center.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:24.125
Fantastic. Alright, its top margin is going to be 120 pixels.

00:16:24.125 --> 00:16:26.975
That's, oh, can you see how beautiful they are?

00:16:26.975 --> 00:16:31.170
I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you in the next one.
