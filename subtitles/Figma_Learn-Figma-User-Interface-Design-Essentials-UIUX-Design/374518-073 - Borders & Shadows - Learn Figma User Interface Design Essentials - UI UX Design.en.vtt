00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.240
Hi,

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.880
everyone.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.660
And welcome back to another video of thes course.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.600
In this video,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.260
we're gonna add Borders and Shadows to our Steingarten.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.840
So without her and I do,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.880
let's get started.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.830
First of all,

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.650
we need to duplicate our art board like this and I'm gonna rename me to Borders.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.610
And that's changed his title to Borders as well.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.570
Fantastic!

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.950
I'm going to remove all of them except the 1st 1 like this.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.300
Then that means you mean pretty good.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.200
And I'm going to change these title to Borders are right.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.600
And now let's detach these colors from their style one by one like this.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.940
And then I need to add a stroke because for Borders,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.350
we need to have stroke.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.830
So let's click on this plus icon like this.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.610
And then I'm going to remove the field pretty good.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:00.730
And let me change the color code to be 52 f two like this and the 2nd 1 as well.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.610
Let me remove the feel add stroke,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.890
and I'm going to change the color.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.930
Could two TB a five and F five OK,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.130
and the next one we're going to do the same thing,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.330
So the color code is going to be double e the double F and to and we don't need the last

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.810
one.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.310
That's keep it simple.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.400
So these three are enough.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.710
Now it's time to create the borders side.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.250
Okay,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.550
so let's select the 1st 1 and I'm going to click on these four darts just like creating

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.280
color styles here.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.240
I'm going to write colors.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.070
Border one that's copied this.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.750
The next fun is going to be colors border,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.650
too.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.660
And the last fun is going to be collars Border three like this.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.210
OK,

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.380
and now let's create a new shape pretty good.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.690
And I'm gonna apply the borders time to this so I can add stroke and from color signs.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.120
I can choose the border color like this one on.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.110
Let's remove the field Fantastic.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.900
I can easily change it to the 2nd 1 and to the 3rd 1 are right now.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.240
We need to add shadows to our style fight,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.050
so I think it's a good idea to add them here in these art board.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.380
So I'm gonna go ahead and change these title to borders and shadows,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.310
and let's change the name of art board as well borders and shadows fantastic.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.090
And then we need to rename these group to borders these groups as well.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.060
Okay,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.210
now let me duplicate it.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.550
And that's right.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.950
Shadows.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.490
You're going to have four different kind of shadows.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.370
So I'm going to duplicate the last one like this.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.530
Fantastic.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.150
And let's elect the 1st 1 We need to detach them from their style pretty good.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.440
And let's elect the first fun.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.830
And here I'm gonna add effects pretty good.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.270
And instead of stroke,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.240
let's add a solid color to it.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.810
OK,

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.120
so I'm going to remove the stroke and use feel are right.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.050
Now let's go to the advanced setting here,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:23.140
and I'm going to change the Blair amount to 10 and the X amount to one end of why to find

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.010
Okay,

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.160
let's change the capacity to 20% as well,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.980
and after that we can create an effect style.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:39.040
So just like under Stein's can click on this plus icon And here let's write shadows one and

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.630
the 2nd 1 as well.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.740
So let's add feel to it and also in effect,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.160
and then I'm going to modify the setting.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:54.820
Now let's set the Blair amount to 20 and the X amount to five and of why amount to 10 like

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.400
this?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.160
And of course,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.070
that's decreased capacity to 20%.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.390
And once again we need to create our effect style.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.190
So I'm going to write shadows,

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.070
too,

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.850
and the next one the same process.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.850
I'm gonna add effects to this.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.350
The Blair amount is going to be 20.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.240
X is going to be two,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.370
and a Y is going to be 10 announce.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.390
Let's decreased capacity to 10% and I'm going to create a new fax time.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:32.500
So let's write Shadows three and the last one once again at feel today's and also an effect

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.500
.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.790
And I'm going to set the Blair amount to 14 the X to one end of wine to five,

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.860
and now I'm going to set the capacity to 10% Fantastic.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.810
That's create our fake style shadows for pretty awesome.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.440
Then let's rename the group's two Shadows for all groups.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.740
Remember that to keep our layers as organized as possible,

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.090
and now I'm gonna show you how you can use this.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.720
Okay,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.900
let's go ahead and create a shape,

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.050
for instance,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.990
Square,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.060
and then I'm going to change the color to something like this And if I click and these four

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.250
darts in the fact section,

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.750
you can see that I have for different shadows so I can click on one.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.810
And there we go.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.050
I can easily change it for anything I want.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.160
It's pretty cool,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.710
isn't it?

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.490
Our right guys that's on for these video.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.850
I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.
