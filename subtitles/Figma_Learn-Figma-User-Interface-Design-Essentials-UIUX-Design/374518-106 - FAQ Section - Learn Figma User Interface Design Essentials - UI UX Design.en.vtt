00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
Hey, welcome back. In this video,

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:07.050
we are going to design the Frequently Asked Questions section.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.665
Okay, so for this section, we need to have,

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:14.670
again a title, subtitle, and some cars.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.950
Okay. These cards are going to be opened and closed within occurred in effect.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.655
Okay.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:23.610
So without further ado, let's get started.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.324
First of all, I'm gonna go ahead and select these two takes layers,

00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:31.520
okay, duplicate them, control V or Command D.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.460
Move them down like this, are right,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.605
the top padding is going to be set to 260 pixels like this.

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:45.590
So the title is going to be changed to frequently asked questions.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.620
Okay, so I'm gonna change these purple section too

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.360
frequently and the right section to asked questions.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.930
Okay, let me change the color to our accent color like this,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.760
and align it to the center.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.695
And the subtitle is going to be changed to something else.

00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:09.830
So I'm going to copy and paste it from my clipboard.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.120
Alright, as you can see,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.980
it's a line paragraph.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.145
So I am going to decrease the width to 600 pixels and align the text to the center,

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:23.330
and also aligned a layer to the center horizontally like this.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.285
The last thing we need to change here is the color.

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:32.435
So I'm gonna change the color to secondary light instead of dark for these description.

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:36.050
Alright, so the description as you can see is if you are not sure

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.905
whether drop is suitable for you or not, do not worry.

00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:43.310
Here to explain everything you might want to know.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.795
And right below that,

00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:47.390
we need to have our questions cards.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.985
Okay, so for our questions card,

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:52.115
we need to create a rectangle.

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:54.050
Click and drag like this.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.095
I'm gonna unhide my layout grids, okay,

00:01:57.095 --> 00:02:01.970
the second column from the left side and the second column from the right side,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.640
that Muslims are a WEF is set to 948 and the height,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.760
I'm gonna change it to 96 pixels.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.245
Then, as you may guess,

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:16.655
we need to use the same styling that we used for these cards.

00:02:16.655 --> 00:02:20.435
So I'm gonna select this rectangle while it's selected,

00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:24.170
right-click on that and copy properties.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.270
Select these rectangle, right-click on that and paste properties.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.915
There we go.

00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:34.265
The only thing we need to change is the corner radius amounts, okay?

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:36.365
As you can see, it's set to 50.

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:38.045
However, it's too much.

00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:40.100
So I'm gonna set it to 20 inset.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.645
Alright, so we need a text layer and we need an icon under rife site.

00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:49.790
So let me create a text layer and I'm going to paste the question from my clipboard.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.035
Okay, there we go.

00:02:51.035 --> 00:02:52.130
Here is a question.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.000
What is the difference between draft and a traditional bank account?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.700
Okay, so let me change the text style to H4. It looks good.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.810
Make sure that it's aligned with our card vertically and it's

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.100
left padding is going to be 30 pixels like this.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.350
On the right side, as I mentioned before,

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.690
we need to place a plus icon.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.585
Okay, so please open up the assets folder.

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:19.880
And in the icons folder,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.635
you can find the plus icon,

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:25.685
drag and drop it into your project and put it right over there.

00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:26.300
It's right.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.820
Padding is going to be 30 pixels.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.440
Make sure that it's aligned vertically to the center of your card.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.180
So select both your eye.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.030
And your card and align it vertically.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.130
There we go. Our car is ready.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.780
It was so simple, wasn't it?

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.850
Now, let's select all of them,

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.835
group them, and I'm gonna call it question.

00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:49.865
Then I'm gonna duplicate it, moves down.

00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:53.135
The margin between them is going to be 20 pixels.

00:03:53.135 --> 00:03:55.850
And now I'm going to change the question to something else.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.150
So let me align these takes layer to the left side,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.540
okay, and then pays the question from a clipboard.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.060
There we go. Who can open a draft account?

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.525
Okay.

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:08.180
Once again, duplicate it and move it down.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.550
And I'm going to change your question this time.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.105
The question is, what if I withdraw money abroad, okay?

00:04:14.105 --> 00:04:16.490
And I'm gonna duplicate it once again will be

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.895
down and change the question to something else.

00:04:19.895 --> 00:04:23.944
Can I cancel my subscription or switch to another plan anytime?

00:04:23.944 --> 00:04:26.510
Once again, duplicated movie down.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.385
And this is our last question.

00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:30.785
I'm going to paste it right away.

00:04:30.785 --> 00:04:31.475
There we go.

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:35.300
What happens if I redraw more than $250?

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.725
Okay, of course you can go ahead and modify these takes layers and those questions,

00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:41.015
it's totally up to you.

00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:43.205
All right, our questions are ready.

00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:45.095
Now I am going to select all of them,

00:04:45.095 --> 00:04:48.650
grouped them, and let's colleagues questions.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.715
Okay, it's top margin is going to be 120 pixels like this.

00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:56.765
It's pretty good.

00:04:56.765 --> 00:04:59.480
However, as you can see right here,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.975
we have so much empty space and it's not good.

00:05:02.975 --> 00:05:07.940
Okay, I'm going to add some background to the section to somehow transit

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.980
from this membership plans section two, this FAQ section.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.195
Okay, I'm going to show you a very cool technique to create amazing backgrounds.

00:05:17.195 --> 00:05:18.950
Ok, let's choose the Pen tool.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.705
Click somber by here.

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:23.090
So now you just created a node,

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.625
click somewhere else and drank.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:30.365
Okay, make sure to click and drag like this to create a curved line.

00:05:30.365 --> 00:05:33.394
And I'm gonna click and drag like this.

00:05:33.394 --> 00:05:34.580
Okay, perfect.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.095
Now I am going to move it down and let's change its color to

00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:44.885
our secondary light color and open up this menu, go to plug-ins.

00:05:44.885 --> 00:05:49.400
And this time I'm going to use a cool plugin called Looper.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.350
If you haven't installed it yet,

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.630
make sure to go to Manage plugins,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.085
then go to community,

00:05:55.085 --> 00:05:56.720
as I showed you before,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.405
and look for the looper plugging in solids,

00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:00.980
and now you can run it.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.025
This plug-in lets you iterate your objects, okay?

00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:07.175
So for example, you can create a shape such as this line.

00:06:07.175 --> 00:06:11.960
And then we can set some values such as iterations, position, scale,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.060
opacity, even color, and then it creates cool shapes and macrons.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.545
Okay, Let's give it its right.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:22.085
So for now I'm going to keep the settings as they are.

00:06:22.085 --> 00:06:24.815
So d iterations is set to 20,

00:06:24.815 --> 00:06:28.265
the position x is 0, y is ten,

00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:29.840
and the angle is five,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.705
the scale is ten opacities, 80%.

00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:35.360
Let's click on Create, are right.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.520
Can you see how amazing it is?

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.720
So now you can easily create a very cool background using

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.310
these plugging press Command Z or Control Z to undo the process.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.960
And I'm going to modify these values.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.455
I'm going to change the iterations to 15 and also the scale to five. Looks good.

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:55.640
So as you can see,

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.590
it created a group for us.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.005
I'm going to name it BG too,

00:07:00.005 --> 00:07:04.595
and make sure to move these PGE2 group all the way down,

00:07:04.595 --> 00:07:09.020
okay, like this movie down, pretty cool.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.190
And then I can press k on my keyword and scale it up.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.515
A little bit of fantastic.

00:07:15.515 --> 00:07:16.730
As you can see here,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.235
we don't have a good contrast ratio.

00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:23.090
So what I'm gonna do is decrease this opacity in

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.770
the layer section 220% like this are right guys,

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.390
that's all for this video.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.390
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next video.
