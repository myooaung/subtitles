00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
Hey,

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.440
everyone in these video,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:08.440
we're gonna be talking about bottoms in design bottoms let users take actions.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.950
So one of our user needs to do something.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.650
Bottoms coming to play.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.630
I think now you understand how important it is to know about bottom designing.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.830
When you're designing a button,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.550
make sure to pay attention to the falling points.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.920
Number one states design all states off the bottom,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.350
such as active,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.610
inactive,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.550
tapped,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.670
hover,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.550
etcetera.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.120
Number two hierarchy know about the hierarchy of your buttons,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.400
for instance,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.310
whether it's high emphasis,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.670
medium emphasis or law emphasis.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.850
Number three placement multiple button types can be utilized to represent various emphasis

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.620
levels.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.280
Number four takes button text buttons are typically used for less pronounced actions,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.530
for example,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.250
in dialogues and cards and last but not least,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.670
contrast buttons should have enough contrast to stress the importance off they

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.620
functionality.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.980
So if you look at the picture on the right,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.740
you can see that we have different states off the bottom.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.820
For instance,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.240
we have active.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.050
As you can see,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.880
it has a sharp color,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.430
and the capacity is 100%.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.590
On the other hand,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.090
we have inactive to show that this button is disabled for now,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.660
which is grey here,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.330
and also we have tapped.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.650
So when the user taps that button,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.110
it changes to that specific color.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.780
As you can see,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.550
we have that's light blue,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.760
and at the end,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.360
as a conceiving have for different buttons,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.840
we have text button.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.380
Also,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.960
we have outlined button and then contain button and also toggle button,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.090
and you need to use them carefully when you're designing a user interface.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.130
Because it is so important to no the users expectation and also in terms of user experience

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.130
,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.340
it's better to use the correct type of bottom in your design.
