00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.360
Hi,

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.010
everyone.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.110
In these video,

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.800
we're gonna be talking about how you can use be hands just like using dribble.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.330
In order to use Behan services,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.380
you need to have an account first.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.150
Then you can browse and check out other designers artwork or create your own project.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.450
The main difference between DRI Bell and B hands is the aspect ratio off your shots or

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.230
projects on dribble.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.040
You cannot upload vertical shot like a landing page completely.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.900
However,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.870
on being hands,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.450
you can upload images with any aspect ratio.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.270
To showcase your artwork,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.380
I recommend using both be hands and rebel at the same time and trying to use their unique

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.500
features to present your design perfectly.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.460
Behan's also lets you upload your high quality images and videos in a single project,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.750
which is a great feature to present an interactive product in no time.
