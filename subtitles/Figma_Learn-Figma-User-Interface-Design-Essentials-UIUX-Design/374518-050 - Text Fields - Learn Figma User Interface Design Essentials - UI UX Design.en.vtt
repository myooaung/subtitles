00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
Hey,

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.850
everyone will come back to another video off this section.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.440
In this video,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.990
we're gonna be talking about text fields,

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.490
As you may know,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.850
takes feels are you elements which allow users to enter attacks into a u I.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.660
They usually appear in dialogues and forms.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.510
Almost every mobile adapts and also website use at least one kind of text fields,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.960
for instance.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.290
You can use them for entering dates,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.390
names,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.190
time,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.170
etcetera.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.780
As a U I designer,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.390
you need to know what the anatomy of a text field as described in the picture.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.070
You may find different kinds of tax feels on different platforms,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.210
so it is recommended to know about the standard your elements that a specific operating

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.420
system uses.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.590
If you look at the picture on the right,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.490
you can see that we have the anatomy off a text field.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.390
As you can see,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.050
we have label.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.970
We have the input text.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.150
We have the trailing icon,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.590
which is optional.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.360
As you can see,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.600
it's number three.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.090
Also,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.280
we have activation indicator.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.770
Sometimes you may use voice input icon or even a drop down icon,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.750
and at the end you can see that we design different States off attacks field.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.620
For example,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.010
if the user enters the password incorrectly,

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.940
the text fields color may change to something else for instance,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.480
red.
