00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
Hello,

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.510
everyone In these video,

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.780
we're gonna be talking about charts.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:12.170
Charts help users to compare Values individualized away When it comes to comparing many

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.030
values,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.380
it's much easier to look at charts right area numbers and agreed.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.130
When you're designing charts,

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.990
make sure to pay attention to the following things.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.870
Number one.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.030
Visibility.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.450
Visibility of a chart.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.850
It's so important because sometimes you have a chart with very small details.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.290
Number two consistency.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.890
Place your charts on a card in order to keep your design clean and consistent.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.330
Lastly,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.320
margins.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.340
Make sure that there is enough white space between your charts and other elements later on

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.340
.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.260
In these scores,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.250
