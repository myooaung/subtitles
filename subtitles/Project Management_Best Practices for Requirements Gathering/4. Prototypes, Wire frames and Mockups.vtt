00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.067
Practical Tools-Prototypes.

2
00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:05.867
A Prototype is typically a preliminary model of something,

3
00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:11.267
and in this case, a preliminary model of your user interface.

4
00:00:11.267 --> 00:00:15.000
Start by gathering the User Stories, Use Cases,

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.786
Workflow Diagrams, and Swim Lanes.

6
00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:20.000
You might call all of this the requirements collateral.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.600
I recommend creating your Prototypes by making paper or

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.000
white board sketches of your screens.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.333
At this point in the process, low-tech is the best.

10
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:34.647
It's fast and efficient, that is, you can throw it away at almost no cost.

11
00:00:34.647 --> 00:00:38.353
Perform a few quick iterations with the product owner,

12
00:00:38.353 --> 00:00:40.667
get feedback, refine your Prototypes,

13
00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:44.667
validate it against the requirements collateral,

14
00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:46.000
and repeat.

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.143
Also, here's a tip.

16
00:00:47.143 --> 00:00:50.000
Consider reviewing the draft Prototypes with the designers and developers.

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.308
This will help bring up any obvious implementation

18
00:00:54.308 --> 00:00:57.000
issues that might arise downstream.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.556
Practical Tools-Prototypes, Part 2.

20
00:00:58.556 --> 00:01:04.632
"This would be a lot easier to understand if you could just draw me a picture.

21
00:01:04.632 --> 00:01:06.842
" Boy, I've heard that many times.

22
00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:07.789
Users love pictures,

23
00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.706
and will help you and your customer better understand

24
00:01:10.706 --> 00:01:12.471
the User Stories and Workflows.

25
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:16.750
For me, I use the term "Prototype" to represent a rough drawing.

26
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.000
Simple and quick, just use a white board or paper as your starting point.

27
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.250
Those coming from a programming background will wanna jump

28
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.750
in and begin using their favorite IDE, Interactive Development Environment.

29
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.333
Don't.

30
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:33.000
Rapid customer feedback is what we're looking for.

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.588
At this point, you are looking for a rough meeting of the minds,

32
00:01:37.588 --> 00:01:39.000
nothing too specific now.

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.500
With your customer, validate your screen Prototypes against your User Stories,

34
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.000
Cases, and Workflows.

35
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.692
Your Prototype may look something like this.

36
00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:51.000
Here's a simple grid with columns.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.471
Here's a simple screen layout.

38
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:56.571
Maybe take pictures of your sketches and use those when you create Wireframes,

39
00:01:56.571 --> 00:02:00.000
which is in the next step.

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.067
Practical Tools-Wireframes.

41
00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:03.200
Consider a Wireframe next.

42
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.267
For me,

43
00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:08.632
I used the term Wireframe to represent using a

44
00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:10.842
drawing tool that mimics a real screen.

45
00:02:10.842 --> 00:02:14.000
The definition of a Wireframe is a schematic or other

46
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
low-fidelity rendering of a computer interface,

47
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.333
intended to primarily demonstrate functionality,

48
00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:24.250
features, content, and user flow.

49
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.000
Okay, the rules of thumb are, again, simple and quick-rapid customer feedback,

50
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.267
validate against User Stories, Cases, and Workflows.

51
00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:39.591
There are many Wireframe tools on the market, some free, and some not so free.

52
00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:40.955
I did this one in Visio.

53
00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:43.000
You can see it has some very simple objects,

54
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.818
like text boxes and grids, to make it easy to mock up.

55
00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:50.769
The point of a Wireframe is to further refine and add detail

56
00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.077
without spending or wasting development time.

57
00:02:53.077 --> 00:02:55.000
It's too early for that.

58
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.842
For those that think you can use an IDE,

59
00:02:57.842 --> 00:03:01.000
just as Visual Studio, for example, to build a Wireframe,

60
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.556
I would say, caution.

61
00:03:02.556 --> 00:03:06.056
You might find yourself wanting to write code rather

62
00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:09.500
than focus on the user's requirements.

63
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.563
Practical Tools-Mockups.

64
00:03:10.563 --> 00:03:13.219
Consider a screen Mockup next.

65
00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:18.800
A Mockup is usually a full-sized scale model used for demonstration.

66
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.600
Be sure your Prototypes and/or Wireframes are solid and have received sufficient

67
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.882
customer feedback and validation before starting this step.

68
00:03:26.882 --> 00:03:32.000
Now, you are using the IDE you will ultimately develop your application with.

69
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.333
Using your IDE is more costly as a Prototype tool if you use

70
00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.714
it too early in the requirements process,

71
00:03:38.714 --> 00:03:43.000
and that's why I cautioned wait and use it as this point.

72
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.158
This graphic depicts a screen that was built in visualstudio.

73
00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:46.474
net.

74
00:03:46.474 --> 00:03:49.923
Tip: If you come from a strong software engineering background,

75
00:03:49.923 --> 00:03:55.000
please resist jumping from User Stories to coding in your IDE.

76
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
You will waste time and money. Trust me, I have seen it happen many times.
