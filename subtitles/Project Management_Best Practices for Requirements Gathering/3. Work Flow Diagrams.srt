Practical Tools-Workflow Diagrams.

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:07,000
When should you use Workflow Diagrams?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
When Use Cases are just too complex to understand,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,000
many times Use Cases, or collections of Use Cases,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,667
are too complex to be shown as Mockup,

6
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:20,375
or a Wireframe is insufficient to fully understand the business rules.

7
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:24,125
This additional clarity, or richer understanding of the business rules,

8
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:28,000
will be needed before you begin to develop your Mockups,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and especially your screen navigation.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,667
If these conditions are true, consider using a Workflow Diagram.

11
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:38,412
A Workflow determines the logical progression of tasks

12
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:41,706
that will be performed and by whom.

13
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:47,500
There are many types of Workflow Diagrams you may want to use,

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
such as State Diagrams, Swim Lanes, Activity Diagrams,

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,900
Data Flow Diagrams, and many others.

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,000
We will talk about two of them.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,615
Practical Tools-State Diagrams.

18
00:00:57,615 --> 00:01:02,462
Creating a Workflow includes identifying the states and the

19
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,750
valid transitions between each state.

20
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,000
A state is usually a status condition, such as new or active.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,313
In this example,

22
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:17,000
this Workflow is the process of managing backlog features for a new system.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,381
If the Workflow is in the new state or condition,

24
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:21,762
then the flow of work is that an implementation has

25
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:27,211
started for this backlog item, then the current state is now active.

26
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:31,000
State Diagrams help to clarify, in your mind,

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,824
all of the possible user and application interactions.

28
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:37,000
This increases the chances that you will at least

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,308
consider coding for all the possibilities,

30
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,000
simply because you now know them all.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,118
And this reduces the chances that you have buggy code,

32
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:49,000
or worse, forgot to handle specific functionality.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,222
Practical Tools-Swim Lane Diagram.

34
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:57,333
A Swim Lane is a visual tool used for Workflow Diagrams,

35
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:01,000
also know as Process Flow Diagrams.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,333
Key attributes are as follows: Visually distinguishes responsibilities

37
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,722
(roles) for sub-processes of a larger business process,

38
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:14,000
so it makes it easy to see who is doing what.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,308
Roles can be arranged either horizontally or vertically.

40
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:21,000
Typically, roles are arranged vertically.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,273
Time or flow is arranged horizontally.

42
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:27,000
Now, let's see an example.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,692
Swim Lane Diagram, Part 2.

44
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:34,000
This diagram is a complete Swim Lane Workflow.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,462
You can see the five horizontal lanes that represent

46
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:39,000
the roles or responsibilities.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay, enough of an eye test.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,667
Let me zoom in now.

49
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:46,000
I have zoomed in on a portion of two roles.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,944
The first is nursing operations.

51
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:49,889
So, within this Swim Lane,

52
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,882
we illustrate the process flow that is the responsibility of nursing operations.

53
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:59,118
Here, we show the process flow with red lines,

54
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:03,000
but you can choose any look and feel you wish.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,333
The rounded, rectangle objects represent the status of a clinic,

56
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,471
such as ordering.

57
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:11,235
In the second Swim Lane is pharmacy operations.

58
00:03:11,235 --> 00:03:16,111
Note where the red Workflow lines cross the horizontal boundary,

59
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:20,000
the responsibility now passes to pharmacy operations.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Remember, you can choose any object shape that helps you convey the Workflow.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Be creative so that you can illustrate, in the most straightforward way, the Workflow for easy understanding by your users.
