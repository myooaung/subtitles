00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Gathering Requirements is Hard Work.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.000
Continuous customer involvement is critical to the project's success.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.429
It's about people, don't lose sight of that,

4
00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.000
and focus continuously on the customer.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.353
How do you involve and engage the customer?

6
00:00:16.353 --> 00:00:19.000
There are two key steps in engaging the customer.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.500
Step 1: Determine who the customer is.

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.000
The customer will be wearing many hats.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.842
Who is the true end user of the system?

10
00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:32.000
Who will actually be using the keyboarding, clicking the mouse?

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.824
Who is the user's representative on this project?

12
00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:38.533
Is it a scrum product manager or a business representative?

13
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.200
Who is funding this project?

14
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.000
What budget or budgets is the money coming from?

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Who is responsible for what tools and processes that are to be used?

16
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.278
If you can answer these questions it will help you determine

17
00:00:54.278 --> 00:00:57.000
the overall and varied set of expectations,

18
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which you need to understand to properly advance the requirements process.

19
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.083
Step 2: Communicate effectively, clearly, and regularly.

20
00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:09.000
You must figure that out.

21
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.750
It could be daily, weekly, etc.

22
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.875
based on the customer's role.

23
00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.125
Written, verbal,

24
00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:21.500
and face-to-face discussions help you ensure you are

25
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.000
collecting quality requirements.

26
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.538
Determining and understanding the stakeholders and effective

27
00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:29.769
communication are critical to your success,

28
00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:33.000
so let's dive deeper into both.

29
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.400
Nailing Down All of the Stakeholders.

30
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.000
Most projects have a fairly diverse set of stakeholders.

31
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.692
Let's explore three groupings of stakeholders.

32
00:01:42.692 --> 00:01:47.000
The first is the product owner stakeholder.

33
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.333
This is the primary representative of the

34
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.000
stakeholders and therefore the stakeholder.

35
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This role should be the focal point for all functional and system requirements.

36
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.077
This role would also ensure requirements and expectations

37
00:02:00.077 --> 00:02:02.000
are aligned with other stakeholders.

38
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.250
This is your key stakeholder.

39
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.000
This is the person you must spend the most of your time with or receive

40
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.375
direction as to what subject matter experts to engage.

41
00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:13.000
You should be joined at the hip.

42
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.143
The second is the End user (aka system) stakeholders.

43
00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:21.000
Notice I said stakeholders, plural.

44
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.692
Typically there is only one product owner stakeholder,

45
00:02:24.692 --> 00:02:27.000
but many end user stakeholders.

46
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.800
For example, a manager, accountant, point-of-sale clerk, etc.

47
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.778
End user stakeholders will use the system hands on,

48
00:02:36.778 --> 00:02:40.278
will consume the result or outcome of the system,

49
00:02:40.278 --> 00:02:43.429
such as reports, work queues, other system interfaces,

50
00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.000
will be affected by its implementation.

51
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.857
For example,

52
00:02:46.857 --> 00:02:53.455
your desktop and network organization needs to implement an equipment roll out.

53
00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:56.000
Lastly, the project stakeholders.

54
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.692
Those have a vested interest during the project

55
00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:02.000
lifecycle of developing the system.

56
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.400
For example, it may include those responsible for training end users,

57
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.909
marketing, selling, installing and supporting the system.

58
00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.000
Also, executive management guiding and funding the project.

59
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.889
So when you start your journey on gathering requirements make

60
00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.222
a list of all of the candidate stakeholders and meet and talk

61
00:03:24.222 --> 00:03:27.000
with each of them frequently.

62
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.077
Communicate Effectively.

63
00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:34.000
As the key analysts gather requirements you will need highly effective

64
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.647
communication skills to translate user and business objectives into a level of

65
00:03:39.647 --> 00:03:44.400
detail to be understood by not only the stakeholders,

66
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.000
but ultimately your software development team.

67
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.529
I am sure you are familiar with these communication methods,

68
00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.000
but let's discuss their pros and cons.

69
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.538
Face to face meetings.

70
00:03:55.538 --> 00:03:59.000
I find face to face meetings always the best.

71
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.500
I know we are really busy, but try and make it a priority.

72
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.000
Workshops.

73
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.857
Workshops use whiteboards or simple prototype tools to quickly

74
00:04:09.857 --> 00:04:12.538
gather and make visually available information.

75
00:04:12.538 --> 00:04:19.000
They should be used early and often in the requirements gathering process.

76
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.125
Telephone/voice mail.

77
00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:24.063
Always good for filling in the gaps,

78
00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:28.000
but lengthy telecons are not very productive.

79
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.429
Email.

80
00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:31.857
Always followup with your customer encounters with your

81
00:04:31.857 --> 00:04:34.500
notes documenting the discussion, action item,

82
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.500
and agreements.

83
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.000
Don't over use email in place of face to face or the phone.

84
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.300
Presentations.

85
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.400
This is a form of face to face that can be used to provide status to the

86
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.667
stakeholders and encourage discussion and guidance.

87
00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:52.000
Stand ups.

88
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Impromptu discussions to quickly clarify requirements.

89
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I love stand ups.

90
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Instant messaging.

91
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.500
If your organization uses text messaging within the firewall,

92
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.667
then this could work for you for quick confirmations,

93
00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:11.000
clarifications, and status updates.

94
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.941
Web conferencing.

95
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:19.000
If you can't do face to face then web conferencing is the next best thing.

96
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.526
Text messaging.

97
00:05:19.526 --> 00:05:22.158
I'm not a fan of texting for the requirements process,

98
00:05:22.158 --> 00:05:25.588
but maybe only for meeting alerts or things like that.

99
00:05:25.588 --> 00:05:26.118
Wikis.

100
00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:30.882
To me project wikis are a little too unstructured,

101
00:05:30.882 --> 00:05:35.227
unmanaged, and unfocused, but give it a try if you can,

102
00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:37.455
and it just might work for you.

103
00:05:37.455 --> 00:05:40.467
Custom requirements portal would be of great help of

104
00:05:40.467 --> 00:05:42.333
centralizing the requirements documentation,

105
00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:47.000
plans, and status, and it would be easy to share.

106
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.917
Which of these options will facilitate connecting

107
00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:52.000
with your stakeholders the best?

108
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.947
Each of these methods has pros and cons,

109
00:05:54.947 --> 00:05:59.000
but as much as possible, engage your customer face to face.

110
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You will receive the biggest return on your time

111
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
investment especially early in the project when you are

112
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
building your initial relationships, connections, and trust.
