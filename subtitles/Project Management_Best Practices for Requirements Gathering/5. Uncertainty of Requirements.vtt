00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.333
Uncertainty of Requirements.

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:08.000
Just what makes requirements so uncertain.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.600
Fact.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.000
Poor up-front definition of requirements is one of the

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
major causes of failed software.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.313
No surprise here.

7
00:00:18.313 --> 00:00:21.813
Let's look deeper on what may cause this.

8
00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:25.882
Successful software development is often affected and in fact,

9
00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:31.529
hindered by the generally poor state of the process of requirements analysis,

10
00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.235
the process by which an analyst conducts their analysis,

11
00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:41.000
and by the artifacts that make up the requirements,

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.722
the documentation, mockups, work flows, data models,

13
00:00:43.722 --> 00:00:48.000
and all of the other items you need to clearly and

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.400
accurately capture the requirements,

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.500
and possibly the ability of the technical business analyst who provides the

16
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.000
interpretation of the business rules and requirements.

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The operative word here is interpretation.

18
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.421
So let's dive a little deeper into the activities of the analyst.

19
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:09.526
The business analyst,

20
00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:13.222
the person doing the requirements gathering typically must

21
00:01:13.222 --> 00:01:16.000
address and understand the following.

22
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.111
Who will be the real system users?

23
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:20.000
The stakeholders.

24
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
There may be many kinds or roles of users.

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.294
The analysts must fully understand and appreciate

26
00:01:27.294 --> 00:01:30.588
the user's needs and expectations, which again,

27
00:01:30.588 --> 00:01:36.500
are many and varied based on the roles of the users.

28
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.000
Also, how well is the problem domain understood?

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Is it a complex sales order process?

30
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Is it a multi system integration project?

31
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Is it a migration to a new ERP system?

32
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
These all require either a deep and rich knowledge

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.667
base or the ability to figure it out.

34
00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:58.800
Lastly, how rigorously, accurately,

35
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.647
and succinctly are the requirements captured in the specification document?

36
00:02:03.647 --> 00:02:09.000
Many of the ones I have had to read are marginal at best.

37
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But wait, there's more.

38
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.222
Uncertainty of Requirements (Part 2).

39
00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:16.111
More importantly,

40
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:22.647
what I'd like to suggest to you is for a new software system or a

41
00:02:22.647 --> 00:02:26.353
major enhancement the requirements will not be completely known

42
00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:29.050
until after the users have used it.

43
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.750
But wait,

44
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.000
you mean to say they won't know what they really want until they use it?

45
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.235
That's crazy talk.

46
00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:39.941
Because of the potential shortfalls that we have discussed,

47
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:42.933
the skills of the business analyst, documentation,

48
00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:46.200
domain knowledge, communication skills, written and verbal,

49
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.600
and more we can say the following truism.

50
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.000
Uncertainty is inherent and inevitable in software development.

51
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So what are we going to do about that?

52
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We embrace and adapt uncertainty and don't fight it.

53
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.947
As we discussed,

54
00:03:05.947 --> 00:03:11.000
you will not get all of the requirements right so let's adapt to a new process.

55
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.500
Avoid taking big steps.

56
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.625
Frequently stop, inspect, and adapt.

57
00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:22.588
Have the shortest possible feedback loop back to your customer.

58
00:03:22.588 --> 00:03:27.882
Deliver specifications and evaluate if it brings the values you

59
00:03:27.882 --> 00:03:32.824
expected it would bring then decide what to deliver next.

60
00:03:32.824 --> 00:03:36.118
By adopting new approaches, tools, and techniques,

61
00:03:36.118 --> 00:03:40.400
such as the agile philosophy into your requirements gathering process,

62
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.600
you can minimize,

63
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.250
but not eliminate the uncertainty of the requirements gathering process.

64
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.875
In the following modules we will look at the tools,

65
00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:55.000
processes to improve your ability in gathering requirements,

66
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.667
and the agile philosophy in its' relationship with

67
00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:01.000
the requirements gathering process.

68
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.143
Are You Up for the Job?

69
00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:06.000
Not everyone is cut out for gathering requirements.

70
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.143
Are you?

71
00:04:07.143 --> 00:04:14.000
Let's talk about the key attributes you need to be more effective.

72
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.176
The ability to be an advocate for the customer,

73
00:04:17.176 --> 00:04:20.000
to be in their shoes, and show empathy.

74
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Strong communication and people skills so you can mediate and get diverse

75
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.222
groups of people to consensus even in the face of challenges.

76
00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:32.667
Have good business acumen and a solid technical foundation so

77
00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:37.600
you can provide deeper insights to the tradeoffs and

78
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.000
priorities of competing requirements.

79
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.375
Ability to gage and adapt to changing stakeholder expectations.

80
00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:45.250
The more stakeholders you have,

81
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.250
the more time you will need to spend managing those expectations,

82
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.000
including conflicting expectations.

83
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.818
Understand what success means to the customer.

84
00:04:56.818 --> 00:04:59.000
Envision the end results.

85
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.632
You need the ability to stay focused on the end results.

86
00:05:03.632 --> 00:05:07.467
You need to possess a decisive character to confidently

87
00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:12.133
and quickly arrive at results while not having all the

88
00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:14.000
necessary information at hand.

89
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So, if your job wasn't going to be hard enough, let's talk about the uncertainty of requirements themselves.
