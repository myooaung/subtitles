00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Practical Tools-User Stories.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,000
Our first Practical Tool is User Stories.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,059
So, what are User Stories?

4
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:11,765
User Stories are an agile term for what traditionally

5
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:14,000
have been called software requirements.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,500
User Stories are brief statements of the intent or need that

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,071
the system must do for a particular user.

8
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:25,214
User Stories are not detailed requirements.

9
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:28,684
We will address detailed requirements later in this module.

10
00:00:28,684 --> 00:00:31,632
This is a simple User Story template.

11
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:38,706
So, as a role, say a sales clerk, I want or need to perform a particular feature,

12
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,588
say a split tender transaction, that's using,

13
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:44,500
say, cash and maybe a credit card at the same time,

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,000
so that there is a benefit.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,684
What is the benefit?

16
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:50,211
The customer has more payment options.

17
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:54,000
That is a simple example of a User Story.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,375
What is very important is that User Stories help bridge

19
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,000
the gap between users and developers.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,579
That is one of your main jobs.

21
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,421
If you do this well,

22
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:10,000
your resulting system will accurately reflect your user requirements.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,588
Practical Tools-User Stories.

24
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:19,000
It is very important that User Stories are written in the user's own words.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,526
User Stories are written from the point of view of the user,

26
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:24,412
and written in the language that your customers would use.

27
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:26,294
No techie-talk here, please.

28
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:32,263
User Stories focus on the value or result users get from doing this thing.

29
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:34,474
So, when you are facilitating a workshop,

30
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:39,250
be sure you coax out the benefit as part of the user story.

31
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:46,000
A User Story is performed by one or more user types, also known as actors.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,421
An example of an actor would be a clerk or a manager.

33
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:53,000
Many times, User Stories are very similar,

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,294
or just variations of a main User Story.

35
00:01:56,294 --> 00:02:00,000
I suggest you aggregate them into User Story Summaries.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,889
Here is an example of a User Story where a student

37
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:08,000
can enroll in a class via email.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,056
Here is an example where a student can drop a class.

39
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:15,222
Certainly the key actor is the student, and since they both apply to the student,

40
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:19,333
you might consider a User Story Summary as containing those two stories.

41
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:26,000
Summaries are informal containers that help you group User Stories.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,316
Here is a User Story to open a class.

43
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:33,000
What User Story Summary might this User Story be contained?

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Since an administrator, the actor, can only open a class,

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
it would be grouped with other administration stories.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,333
Practical Tools-Use Cases.

47
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,444
Use Cases are similar to User Stories,

48
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:49,923
in that they are still written in the user's words

49
00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:55,000
and express the expected outcome, but provide a little more detail.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,133
Again, no techie-talk, please.

51
00:02:57,133 --> 00:03:04,600
Use Case Template comprised of a Use Case title, or name, like drop a class.

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,000
A brief description, just one or two sentences is usually enough.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,200
Actors or users that relate to this Use Case,

54
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,000
such as a student or administrator.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,263
Flow of events.

56
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:21,053
Express the main flow of events and interactions between

57
00:03:21,053 --> 00:03:24,000
the actors that use this Use Case.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There are optional elements, as well, that you can add.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Alternative paths or extensions.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,500
These would be variations on the above cases.

61
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:33,813
Preconditions.

62
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:38,947
The things that must have already happened in the system prior to this Use Case.

63
00:03:38,947 --> 00:03:39,684
Success scenario.

64
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:44,250
What is supposed to happen, described as a series of steps.

65
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,500
Post conditions.

66
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:53,000
What the system will have done by the end of these steps?

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Scope Validation.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Remember our Project Definition Template from Module 1?

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,500
It included a high-level scope.

70
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:07,000
So, our User Stories must fit into the context of the project definition.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,375
Look for gaps/overlaps of the User Stories and cases,

72
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:15,471
and work with your customers to refine, and especially fill in the gaps.

73
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:19,588
A simple, visual representation of all of my User Stories,

74
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:28,000
Cases, and Summaries can be very helpful, just to see how it all fits together, and to ensure the scope is covered.
