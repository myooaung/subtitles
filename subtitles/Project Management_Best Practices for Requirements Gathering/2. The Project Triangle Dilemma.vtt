00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.846
Process, process, process.

2
00:00:03.846 --> 00:00:10.000
Process is critical to the success of gathering quality requirements.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.235
If you can't describe what you're doing as a process,

4
00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:15.500
you don't know what you are doing.

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.250
Deming was an amazing business management consultant.

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.000
There are two critical points to process.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.059
User's business process.

8
00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:27.941
If your users cannot describe or articulate their business process then

9
00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:30.647
how can you possibly gather quality requirements?

10
00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:34.353
So it will be your job, using your tools,

11
00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:37.600
to extract and document their business processes.

12
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.933
Secondly, and importantly, in your own role of gathering requirements,

13
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.636
you must define and follow your own process.

14
00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:49.182
You need to have in your tool belt the methods and tools to

15
00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.000
help you be successful in your endeavor.

16
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This course will help you do just that.

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.400
The Project 'Triangle' Dilemma consists of three key elements.

18
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.000
Scope.

19
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.375
You will need to determine all the things the

20
00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:08.000
customer would like this system to do.

21
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.368
Schedule.

22
00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:12.421
You will need to determine when they would like the completed

23
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:16.000
system or possibly they may want it in increments.

24
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.500
Cost.

25
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.000
How much can they afford?

26
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What is their budget?

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.727
Scope, schedule, and cost are in a sense, at odds of each other.

28
00:01:25.727 --> 00:01:30.714
If one changes then one or both of the others must change.

29
00:01:30.714 --> 00:01:37.000
It is very important to educate your customer on this concept.

30
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.267
The interplay of these three elements directly affects

31
00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:45.000
quality and the success of your project.

32
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.176
Knowing your desired result is a very important concept.

33
00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:51.692
The indispensable first step to getting what you want

34
00:01:51.692 --> 00:01:55.846
accomplished is deciding what you want.

35
00:01:55.846 --> 00:02:00.000
Describe and characterize those desired results.

36
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.895
So users who are in this system, what is it really?

37
00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:08.000
How do you describe and characterize what the results of the project will be.

38
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.500
A Project Definition template is your first step in

39
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.667
realizing results by creating a Project Definition

40
00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:24.000
Template you will be quickly on your way. A Project Definition Template equals results.
