00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Let's reset.

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Let's revisit what we have so far.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.533
We have User Stories and Use Cases, Work Flows and Swim Lanes,

4
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.133
Prototypes, Wireframes, Mockups.

5
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:18.778
You may not need both Prototypes and Wireframes prior to building your Mockups,

6
00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:23.833
but I recommend it for the simple reason you are spending quality time

7
00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:26.875
extracting and refining business rules with your customer.

8
00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:29.500
You may also have other project artifacts,

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.625
such as spreadsheets and forms, documents,

10
00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:32.563
notes, et cetera.

11
00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:36.500
Be sure you have addressed all of your stakeholders' needs and requirements.

12
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
Review these documents with all stakeholders.

13
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.000
This may take several forms and formats.

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.846
Conduct user walkthroughs, demonstrations,

15
00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:49.500
workshops to further reinforce and validate what you have collected.

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.000
Review your schedule and budget.

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.500
Okay, if the stakeholders are on track, the budget,

18
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.000
resources, and schedules still look good,

19
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
let's proceed.

20
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.600
The Requirements Gatherer's TRIAD.

21
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.000
A TRIAD is a group or set of three connected things.

22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.529
In my experience, the following three items are very tightly connected,

23
00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:19.700
and are continuously playing off of each other: Prototypes,

24
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.200
Wireframes, and Mockups, Business Rules,

25
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.000
Database Design.

26
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.400
Remember,

27
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000
each of these three elements are continuously helping and

28
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
supporting each other throughout your process.

29
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The Requirements Gatherer's TRIAD, Part 2.

30
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.500
By walking and talking your way through these system design tools,

31
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.000
you will hear, observe, and extract Business Rules and data elements.

32
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.526
As you are showing the users your Prototypes,

33
00:01:50.526 --> 00:01:54.000
they may say, "If the purchase amount is greater than $100,

34
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.400
then shipping is free.

35
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.250
" That is a Business Rule that you must write down

36
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.000
in the Business Rules Document.

37
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.278
Also,

38
00:02:01.278 --> 00:02:04.611
you must capture the data elements in your data model design document

39
00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:07.800
that are required to implement the shipping rule.

40
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.600
Your Prototypes, Wireframes,

41
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:20.000
and Mockups are essential to drive and greatly enhance the data model and the Business Rules.
