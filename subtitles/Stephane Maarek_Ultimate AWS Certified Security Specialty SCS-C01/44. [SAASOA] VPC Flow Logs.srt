00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,307
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about VPC flow logs.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,307  -->  00:00:04,620
VPC flow logs allow you to capture information
3

3

00:00:04,620  -->  00:00:07,050
from IP traffic going into your interfaces.
4

4

00:00:07,050  -->  00:00:08,880
So that could be at the VPC level,
5

5

00:00:08,880  -->  00:00:10,170
the subnet level,
6

6

00:00:10,170  -->  00:00:13,050
or the Elastic Network Interface, ENI, level.
7

7

00:00:13,050  -->  00:00:15,390
So we have three kinds of flow logs.
8

8

00:00:15,390  -->  00:00:16,890
They're very helpful to monitor
9

9

00:00:16,890  -->  00:00:18,840
and troubleshoot connectivity issues
10

10

00:00:18,840  -->  00:00:20,610
happening within your VPC.
11

11

00:00:20,610  -->  00:00:22,590
So these flow logs can be sent to two destinations.
12

12

00:00:22,590  -->  00:00:25,470
They can be sent to Amazon S3 and CloudWatch Logs.
13

13

00:00:25,470  -->  00:00:26,850
And they will capture information
14

14

00:00:26,850  -->  00:00:29,280
for also AWS managed interfaces,
15

15

00:00:29,280  -->  00:00:33,810
such as ELB, RDS, ElastiCache, Redshift, WorkSpaces,
16

16

00:00:33,810  -->  00:00:36,450
your NAT Gateway, your Transit Gateway, and so on.
17

17

00:00:36,450  -->  00:00:38,280
So in this graph, well, it's very simple,
18

18

00:00:38,280  -->  00:00:40,290
your flow logs are at the VPC level, for example,
19

19

00:00:40,290  -->  00:00:41,820
or subnets or ENI level,
20

20

00:00:41,820  -->  00:00:44,640
and they're sent to CloudWatch and Amazon S3.
21

21

00:00:44,640  -->  00:00:47,760
So this is what a VPC flow log looks like.
22

22

00:00:47,760  -->  00:00:49,920
So there is a format associated with it,
23

23

00:00:49,920  -->  00:00:52,860
but there is the version, account ID, interface ID,
24

24

00:00:52,860  -->  00:00:54,540
source address, destination address,
25

25

00:00:54,540  -->  00:00:56,490
source port, destination port, protocol,
26

26

00:00:56,490  -->  00:01:00,330
packets, bytes, start, end, action, and log status.
27

27

00:01:00,330  -->  00:01:02,460
So this is metadata about the network packets
28

28

00:01:02,460  -->  00:01:05,160
going into your VPC.
29

29

00:01:05,160  -->  00:01:07,650
And you don't need to remember this at a high level, right?
30

30

00:01:07,650  -->  00:01:10,680
But let's have a look at what information we can get
31

31

00:01:10,680  -->  00:01:11,790
out of these flow logs.
32

32

00:01:11,790  -->  00:01:13,500
So the source address and the destination address
33

33

00:01:13,500  -->  00:01:15,780
help identify problematic IP.
34

34

00:01:15,780  -->  00:01:18,540
This is where you see if an IP is repeatedly being denied.
35

35

00:01:18,540  -->  00:01:19,830
Maybe there is something wrong with an IP
36

36

00:01:19,830  -->  00:01:22,380
or maybe you're being attacked by a specific IP.
37

37

00:01:22,380  -->  00:01:24,030
Source port and destination port
38

38

00:01:24,030  -->  00:01:26,160
help you identify the problematic ports.
39

39

00:01:26,160  -->  00:01:29,460
Action is going to be either accept or reject,
40

40

00:01:29,460  -->  00:01:30,750
and so it's going to say
41

41

00:01:30,750  -->  00:01:32,610
whether or not it's a success or failure
42

42

00:01:32,610  -->  00:01:34,530
at the SG or NACL level.
43

43

00:01:34,530  -->  00:01:36,000
And we'll see this in the very next slide.
44

44

00:01:36,000  -->  00:01:38,100
And so this can be used, VPC flow logs,
45

45

00:01:38,100  -->  00:01:40,290
to do analytics on usage patterns,
46

46

00:01:40,290  -->  00:01:43,950
or detect managed behavior, port scans, and so on.
47

47

00:01:43,950  -->  00:01:44,910
Now, to query these flow logs,
48

48

00:01:44,910  -->  00:01:46,290
you have two ways of doing it.
49

49

00:01:46,290  -->  00:01:48,600
The best way is to do Athena on S3.
50

50

00:01:48,600  -->  00:01:50,670
Or if you wanted to do a streaming analysis,
51

51

00:01:50,670  -->  00:01:52,680
you could use CloudWatch Logs Insights.
52

52

00:01:52,680  -->  00:01:54,810
So here are some examples that you can have a look
53

53

00:01:54,810  -->  00:01:56,610
on your own time for flow logs.
54

54

00:01:56,610  -->  00:01:57,900
So, how do we use flow logs
55

55

00:01:57,900  -->  00:02:00,870
to troubleshoot Security Group and NACL issues?
56

56

00:02:00,870  -->  00:02:02,190
Well, we look at the Action field.
57

57

00:02:02,190  -->  00:02:05,220
So let's have a look at the typical incoming request
58

58

00:02:05,220  -->  00:02:06,330
for your NACL and your subnet.
59

59

00:02:06,330  -->  00:02:08,250
So remember, your NACLs are stateless
60

60

00:02:08,250  -->  00:02:10,800
and your Security Groups are stateful.
61

61

00:02:10,800  -->  00:02:11,940
So, what happens?
62

62

00:02:11,940  -->  00:02:13,740
Well, if we get an inbound reject,
63

63

00:02:13,740  -->  00:02:16,110
so we see that the inbound request
64

64

00:02:16,110  -->  00:02:19,380
from the outside to our EC2 instance is rejected,
65

65

00:02:19,380  -->  00:02:21,390
that can mean that either, from this graph,
66

66

00:02:21,390  -->  00:02:23,670
the NACL is refusing the request
67

67

00:02:23,670  -->  00:02:26,550
or the Security Group is refusing the request.
68

68

00:02:26,550  -->  00:02:28,110
And this makes sense, right?
69

69

00:02:28,110  -->  00:02:32,040
But if we have a inbound accept and an outbound reject,
70

70

00:02:32,040  -->  00:02:34,170
it can only mean a NACL issue.
71

71

00:02:34,170  -->  00:02:36,690
Why? Well, because your security group is stateful,
72

72

00:02:36,690  -->  00:02:39,540
and if the inbound is allowed because of the accept,
73

73

00:02:39,540  -->  00:02:41,880
automatically the outbound will be allowed
74

74

00:02:41,880  -->  00:02:44,760
thanks to the statefulness of your Security Group.
75

75

00:02:44,760  -->  00:02:46,950
So for outgoing requests, similar analysis, right?
76

76

00:02:46,950  -->  00:02:48,690
This is the diagram we know already.
77

77

00:02:48,690  -->  00:02:50,700
And so if you got an outbound reject,
78

78

00:02:50,700  -->  00:02:53,280
then you have a NACL or a Security Group issue.
79

79

00:02:53,280  -->  00:02:55,890
But if you got an outbound accepted and an inbound reject,
80

80

00:02:55,890  -->  00:02:58,530
then it must mean a NACL issue.
81

81

00:02:58,530  -->  00:03:00,600
So let's have a look at a few architectures
82

82

00:03:00,600  -->  00:03:02,160
for your VPC flow logs.
83

83

00:03:02,160  -->  00:03:04,860
So they can flow into CloudWatch Logs, as we know.
84

84

00:03:04,860  -->  00:03:06,090
And then we can use something called
85

85

00:03:06,090  -->  00:03:08,340
CloudWatch Contributor Insights, for example,
86

86

00:03:08,340  -->  00:03:10,620
to find the top 10 IP addresses
87

87

00:03:10,620  -->  00:03:12,900
that contribute to the most amount of network
88

88

00:03:12,900  -->  00:03:17,190
on your VPC, or on ENI, or whatever you want.
89

89

00:03:17,190  -->  00:03:18,510
You can also use VPC flow logs
90

90

00:03:18,510  -->  00:03:20,550
to send them again into CloudWatch Logs.
91

91

00:03:20,550  -->  00:03:22,650
Here, we can set up a metric filter
92

92

00:03:22,650  -->  00:03:26,460
to look, for example, for the SSH or the RDP protocols.
93

93

00:03:26,460  -->  00:03:28,610
And if we realize that there's a lot more SSH
94

94

00:03:28,610  -->  00:03:31,740
or RDP than usual, then trigger a CloudWatch alarm,
95

95

00:03:31,740  -->  00:03:34,710
and send an alert into an Amazon SNS topic
96

96

00:03:34,710  -->  00:03:37,980
because something fishy may be happening on your network.
97

97

00:03:37,980  -->  00:03:40,260
Or we can use a VPC flow log.
98

98

00:03:40,260  -->  00:03:43,890
And then we send everything into an S3 bucket for storage.
99

99

00:03:43,890  -->  00:03:46,230
And we use Amazon Athena to analyze
100

100

00:03:46,230  -->  00:03:48,450
the VPC flow logs with SQL.
101

101

00:03:48,450  -->  00:03:51,840
And we can even visualize that with Amazon QuickSight.
102

102

00:03:51,840  -->  00:03:53,760
So that's it for VPC flow logs.
103

103

00:03:53,760  -->  00:03:54,840
I hope you liked it.
104

104

00:03:54,840  -->  00:03:56,790
And I will see you in the next lecture.
