00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.950
<v Instructor>So here is a very short lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01.950  -->  00:00:04.200
about Shield Advanced because you can get
3

3

00:00:04.200  -->  00:00:05.820
CloudWatch metrics out of it
4

4

00:00:05.820  -->  00:00:08.190
and they're going to help you figure out,
5

5

00:00:08.190  -->  00:00:10.620
if there is a DDoS attack happening right now
6

6

00:00:10.620  -->  00:00:12.180
on your infrastructure.
7

7

00:00:12.180  -->  00:00:14.460
So there is a metric called DDoSDetected
8

8

00:00:14.460  -->  00:00:17.220
which indicates whether there's a DDoS event happening
9

9

00:00:17.220  -->  00:00:18.930
for a specific resource.
10

10

00:00:18.930  -->  00:00:22.200
There is a DDoSAttackBitsPerSecond, which gives you
11

11

00:00:22.200  -->  00:00:25.440
the number of bits attacking a specific resource.
12

12

00:00:25.440  -->  00:00:26.940
There is the DDoSAttackPacketsPerSecond
13

13

00:00:28.320  -->  00:00:29.550
which gives you the number of packets
14

14

00:00:29.550  -->  00:00:32.040
being sent for a specific resource.
15

15

00:00:32.040  -->  00:00:35.100
And then the DDoSAttackRequestsPerSecond,
16

16

00:00:35.100  -->  00:00:36.720
which gives you an idea of how many requests
17

17

00:00:36.720  -->  00:00:39.420
are happening on a specific resource.
18

18

00:00:39.420  -->  00:00:42.120
And all these things combined is, basically,
19

19

00:00:42.120  -->  00:00:45.690
allowing you to understand what is happening
20

20

00:00:45.690  -->  00:00:48.180
and how the attack is being conducted.
21

21

00:00:48.180  -->  00:00:50.010
All right, that's it, short lecture I promised,
22

22

00:00:50.010  -->  00:00:51.270
but I hope you liked it
23

23

00:00:51.270  -->  00:00:53.220
and I will see you in the next lecture.
