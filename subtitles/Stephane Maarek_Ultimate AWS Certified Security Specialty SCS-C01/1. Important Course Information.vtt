00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:02.250
<v ->Hi, this is Stephane Maarek and welcome</v>
2

2

00:00:02.250  -->  00:00:05.310
to the AWS Security Specialty Course.
3

3

00:00:05.310  -->  00:00:07.110
I'm so glad to have you here.
4

4

00:00:07.110  -->  00:00:09.180
I just need five minutes of your time
5

5

00:00:09.180  -->  00:00:13.140
to go over some very important points about this course.
6

6

00:00:13.140  -->  00:00:15.720
So let's go over the course structure.
7

7

00:00:15.720  -->  00:00:17.520
So there is one section in this course
8

8

00:00:17.520  -->  00:00:19.920
per domain at the exam, and I have an extra section
9

9

00:00:19.920  -->  00:00:22.230
at the end for the additional knowledge.
10

10

00:00:22.230  -->  00:00:25.320
And in each domain, in each section,
11

11

00:00:25.320  -->  00:00:28.530
some lectures are gonna be taken from other courses.
12

12

00:00:28.530  -->  00:00:30.300
This is to get the basic knowledge
13

13

00:00:30.300  -->  00:00:32.040
because sometimes you may be liking it,
14

14

00:00:32.040  -->  00:00:33.570
sometimes you may have it.
15

15

00:00:33.570  -->  00:00:36.120
So I have marked the lectures that have been taken
16

16

00:00:36.120  -->  00:00:40.110
from other courses with brackets, for example, SAA
17

17

00:00:40.110  -->  00:00:43.680
for Solutions Architect Associate, DVA for developer,
18

18

00:00:43.680  -->  00:00:47.670
SOA for SysOps, and CCP for Cloud Practitioner.
19

19

00:00:47.670  -->  00:00:48.720
If you were wondering
20

20

00:00:48.720  -->  00:00:51.720
about the distribution of new versus existing,
21

21

00:00:51.720  -->  00:00:54.240
some sections have more new content than existing content,
22

22

00:00:54.240  -->  00:00:57.480
such as domain one, domain four, and domain five
23

23

00:00:57.480  -->  00:01:00.210
and domain two and three are a bit more redundant
24

24

00:01:00.210  -->  00:01:01.860
versus other certifications.
25

25

00:01:01.860  -->  00:01:04.200
That's why you have more existing than new content.
26

26

00:01:04.200  -->  00:01:07.410
Overall, if you have done these lectures in other courses,
27

27

00:01:07.410  -->  00:01:08.430
you can skip them,
28

28

00:01:08.430  -->  00:01:10.650
but if you wanted to get back the knowledge,
29

29

00:01:10.650  -->  00:01:12.330
you should watch them all.
30

30

00:01:12.330  -->  00:01:14.130
Hopefully you understand my decision
31

31

00:01:14.130  -->  00:01:16.140
to wanted to include basic knowledge,
32

32

00:01:16.140  -->  00:01:18.270
as well as exam-specific knowledge
33

33

00:01:18.270  -->  00:01:20.370
for the security specialty.
34

34

00:01:20.370  -->  00:01:21.540
So just something about me.
35

35

00:01:21.540  -->  00:01:22.920
Well, I'm Stephane
36

36

00:01:22.920  -->  00:01:25.260
and I've been teaching AWS for a long time now.
37

37

00:01:25.260  -->  00:01:28.530
I have 10 AWS certifications so far.
38

38

00:01:28.530  -->  00:01:29.880
I've worked with AWS for many years.
39

39

00:01:29.880  -->  00:01:32.910
I've built websites, applications, streaming platforms
40

40

00:01:32.910  -->  00:01:35.040
and I've been teaching about certifications
41

41

00:01:35.040  -->  00:01:36.900
on Udemy for such a long time.
42

42

00:01:36.900  -->  00:01:39.857
I have close to 2 million students that followed my courses
43

43

00:01:39.857  -->  00:01:42.090
so I'm so happy to be your teacher today.
44

44

00:01:42.090  -->  00:01:43.890
I'm very glad for the trust.
45

45

00:01:43.890  -->  00:01:45.690
You can find me on LinkedIn.
46

46

00:01:45.690  -->  00:01:46.950
You can find me on Instagram.
47

47

00:01:46.950  -->  00:01:50.010
This is where I meet my students in real life.
48

48

00:01:50.010  -->  00:01:52.410
This is Twitter for some updates as well.
49

49

00:01:52.410  -->  00:01:55.620
GitHub, and finally, Medium for some blogs.
50

50

00:01:55.620  -->  00:01:56.453
All right, that's it.
51

51

00:01:56.453  -->  00:01:57.780
I'm so happy you're here.
52

52

00:01:57.780  -->  00:01:59.530
Let's get started with this course.
