00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:01,080
<v Instructor>So let's explore</v>
2

2

00:00:01,080  -->  00:00:05,520
a couple of VPC traffic mirroring architectures.
3

3

00:00:05,520  -->  00:00:08,820
So in the first case, we can have the traffic distributed
4

4

00:00:08,820  -->  00:00:11,430
across EC2 instances in an ASG
5

5

00:00:11,430  -->  00:00:13,440
and that will be the same security appliance.
6

6

00:00:13,440  -->  00:00:18,180
So we have our VPC with a public subnet, a private subnet,
7

7

00:00:18,180  -->  00:00:20,520
and then we've created another private subnet
8

8

00:00:20,520  -->  00:00:23,550
with an autoscaling group of EC2 instances
9

9

00:00:23,550  -->  00:00:26,130
that are security monitoring appliances.
10

10

00:00:26,130  -->  00:00:28,560
We put a network level balancer in front of them
11

11

00:00:28,560  -->  00:00:30,900
so that we can receive any kind of traffic.
12

12

00:00:30,900  -->  00:00:32,790
And then we're going to enable traffic mirroring
13

13

00:00:32,790  -->  00:00:35,520
from the EC2 instance in my public subnet
14

14

00:00:35,520  -->  00:00:37,170
and my private subnet.
15

15

00:00:37,170  -->  00:00:40,110
And all that traffic is going to flow and scale
16

16

00:00:40,110  -->  00:00:42,090
because we're using an autoscaling group.
17

17

00:00:42,090  -->  00:00:43,170
And this is going to go
18

18

00:00:43,170  -->  00:00:46,440
to the same kind of security appliance.
19

19

00:00:46,440  -->  00:00:49,680
We have another kind where we want to distribute traffic
20

20

00:00:49,680  -->  00:00:51,720
to multiple EC2 instances
21

21

00:00:51,720  -->  00:00:53,850
that have different security appliances.
22

22

00:00:53,850  -->  00:00:55,080
So in this case,
23

23

00:00:55,080  -->  00:00:57,780
we have the same EC2 instances we want to monitor
24

24

00:00:57,780  -->  00:00:59,610
but then we're going to, in a private subnet,
25

25

00:00:59,610  -->  00:01:03,030
create different kind of EC2 instances
26

26

00:01:03,030  -->  00:01:04,080
based on their function.
27

27

00:01:04,080  -->  00:01:07,530
So different partner solutions for security.
28

28

00:01:07,530  -->  00:01:08,760
In this case, what we need to do
29

29

00:01:08,760  -->  00:01:10,350
is to do traffic mirroring
30

30

00:01:10,350  -->  00:01:13,680
into what we call a Cloud Packet Broker.
31

31

00:01:13,680  -->  00:01:15,420
It's a third party appliance.
32

32

00:01:15,420  -->  00:01:19,950
And this allows you to actually redirect the correct traffic
33

33

00:01:19,950  -->  00:01:22,380
to the correct security appliance.
34

34

00:01:22,380  -->  00:01:24,510
So that's a different architecture model.
35

35

00:01:24,510  -->  00:01:26,010
Now, if you want to go distributed
36

36

00:01:26,010  -->  00:01:28,320
you can have two VPCs,
37

37

00:01:28,320  -->  00:01:29,970
and in each VPC you'll have
38

38

00:01:29,970  -->  00:01:31,740
a different monitoring appliance.
39

39

00:01:31,740  -->  00:01:32,970
So in this instance,
40

40

00:01:32,970  -->  00:01:36,810
the EC2 instance A is monitored by the Appliance 1
41

41

00:01:36,810  -->  00:01:41,810
and the EC2 instance B is monitored by the Appliance 2.
42

42

00:01:42,360  -->  00:01:46,260
You can also go into a different kind of setup
43

43

00:01:46,260  -->  00:01:50,280
where you have one monitoring appliance in one VPC
44

44

00:01:50,280  -->  00:01:52,740
and then by establishing VPC peering,
45

45

00:01:52,740  -->  00:01:55,320
you can have instance D and instance E
46

46

00:01:55,320  -->  00:01:56,760
directly mirror traffic
47

47

00:01:56,760  -->  00:01:59,253
into the monitoring Appliance number 3.
48

48

00:02:00,420  -->  00:02:04,260
There's also a way to automate VPC traffic mirroring.
49

49

00:02:04,260  -->  00:02:06,087
So let's take an example of GuardDuty
50

50

00:02:06,087  -->  00:02:08,280
and GuardDuty has found an alert
51

51

00:02:08,280  -->  00:02:10,710
on one of our EC2 instances.
52

52

00:02:10,710  -->  00:02:13,890
It's going to pass on that finding to Amazon EventBridge,
53

53

00:02:13,890  -->  00:02:14,723
and from EventBridge,
54

54

00:02:14,723  -->  00:02:17,220
we're going to invoke a Lambda function.
55

55

00:02:17,220  -->  00:02:18,540
That Lambda function is going to look
56

56

00:02:18,540  -->  00:02:21,210
at the payload of the alerts,
57

57

00:02:21,210  -->  00:02:24,120
and it's going to identify the EC2 instance
58

58

00:02:24,120  -->  00:02:27,270
and the corresponding ENI attached to that instance
59

59

00:02:27,270  -->  00:02:31,110
that needs VPC network traffic mirroring.
60

60

00:02:31,110  -->  00:02:33,960
So that instance is in my VPC,
61

61

00:02:33,960  -->  00:02:36,090
but first we need to make sure from the Lambda function
62

62

00:02:36,090  -->  00:02:39,150
that we launch a virtual monitoring appliance
63

63

00:02:39,150  -->  00:02:41,010
to receive that mirror traffic.
64

64

00:02:41,010  -->  00:02:42,150
So we launch it
65

65

00:02:42,150  -->  00:02:46,500
and then we enable VPC traffic mirroring on my EC2 instance
66

66

00:02:46,500  -->  00:02:49,080
that was detected by GuardDuty.
67

67

00:02:49,080  -->  00:02:51,270
So automatically the packets of the network
68

68

00:02:51,270  -->  00:02:52,980
are going to be forwarded,
69

69

00:02:52,980  -->  00:02:56,370
and then we can send them directly into an S3 bucket
70

70

00:02:56,370  -->  00:03:00,030
so that the logs could be analyzed later on by Athena.
71

71

00:03:00,030  -->  00:03:01,710
And all of this is automated,
72

72

00:03:01,710  -->  00:03:04,050
so hopefully that opens up your mind.
73

73

00:03:04,050  -->  00:03:06,510
Finally, you can also have an architecture
74

74

00:03:06,510  -->  00:03:09,780
for VPC traffic mirroring that leverages a transit gateway
75

75

00:03:09,780  -->  00:03:12,750
between several accounts and several VPCs.
76

76

00:03:12,750  -->  00:03:15,780
But the idea is that you want to have a centralized VPC
77

77

00:03:15,780  -->  00:03:16,613
where you'll have
78

78

00:03:16,613  -->  00:03:19,710
all your security appliances and monitoring.
79

79

00:03:19,710  -->  00:03:20,543
So in that case,
80

80

00:03:20,543  -->  00:03:23,130
well, because we have set up a transit gateway,
81

81

00:03:23,130  -->  00:03:26,130
now any EC2 instance in any VPC
82

82

00:03:26,130  -->  00:03:27,720
can send their traffic directly
83

83

00:03:27,720  -->  00:03:31,170
into the network level balancer of the centralized VPC.
84

84

00:03:31,170  -->  00:03:33,690
And this works great and this scales great,
85

85

00:03:33,690  -->  00:03:35,940
but you will have higher data transfer cost
86

86

00:03:35,940  -->  00:03:38,820
because everything goes through a transit gateway.
87

87

00:03:38,820  -->  00:03:40,500
All right, that's it for this lecture.
88

88

00:03:40,500  -->  00:03:43,500
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
