1

00:00:00,450  -->  00:00:02,190
<v Narrator>So there are two versions of STS</v>
2

2

00:00:02,190  -->  00:00:03,120
you need to know about.
3

3

00:00:03,120  -->  00:00:06,210
You have STS Version 1 and STS Version 2.
4

4

00:00:06,210  -->  00:00:09,060
So by default, STS Version 1 is available
5

5

00:00:09,060  -->  00:00:12,420
as a global single endpoint at this URL.
6

6

00:00:12,420  -->  00:00:13,380
And so when you're a user,
7

7

00:00:13,380  -->  00:00:16,170
you're going to make an API call into STS.
8

8

00:00:16,170  -->  00:00:18,480
You're going to use it's global endpoint
9

9

00:00:18,480  -->  00:00:20,943
and you're going to get back an STS Token v1.
10

10

00:00:22,200  -->  00:00:24,750
And this global endpoint supports only
11

11

00:00:24,750  -->  00:00:26,160
the regions that are enabled
12

12

00:00:26,160  -->  00:00:28,140
by default in your accounts,
13

13

00:00:28,140  -->  00:00:30,150
but you can actually have a setting
14

14

00:00:30,150  -->  00:00:34,620
to change and enable "All Regions" for STS.
15

15

00:00:34,620  -->  00:00:37,380
The other option is to have STS Version 2.
16

16

00:00:37,380  -->  00:00:39,720
And the reason why we have STS Version 2
17

17

00:00:39,720  -->  00:00:42,060
is that the Version 1 tokens, as I said,
18

18

00:00:42,060  -->  00:00:44,700
they do not work with for the new AWS Regions.
19

19

00:00:44,700  -->  00:00:46,140
For example, if you consider
20

20

00:00:46,140  -->  00:00:48,480
the me-south-1 region,
21

21

00:00:48,480  -->  00:00:50,160
it's not enabled by default.
22

22

00:00:50,160  -->  00:00:52,500
And so to get a token for that region,
23

23

00:00:52,500  -->  00:00:55,710
you must use, instead, a Regional STS endpoint,
24

24

00:00:55,710  -->  00:00:57,810
and that's available in all regions.
25

25

00:00:57,810  -->  00:01:00,930
So here for the me-south-1 region,
26

26

00:01:00,930  -->  00:01:03,330
we have a STS Regional endpoint,
27

27

00:01:03,330  -->  00:01:05,490
and if we do a query onto it,
28

28

00:01:05,490  -->  00:01:07,470
we're going to get an STS token
29

29

00:01:07,470  -->  00:01:09,510
in the Version 2 format.
30

30

00:01:09,510  -->  00:01:11,790
So whether we have a global endpoint
31

31

00:01:11,790  -->  00:01:13,230
and a regional endpoint,
32

32

00:01:13,230  -->  00:01:15,840
well, if you're using a regional endpoint
33

33

00:01:15,840  -->  00:01:18,030
you're going to get reduced latency.
34

34

00:01:18,030  -->  00:01:20,070
You're going to get built-in redundancy.
35

35

00:01:20,070  -->  00:01:23,310
And you can increase the session token validity.
36

36

00:01:23,310  -->  00:01:24,420
So, by the way,
37

37

00:01:24,420  -->  00:01:26,340
the tokens you are going to obtain
38

38

00:01:26,340  -->  00:01:28,260
through a regional endpoint
39

39

00:01:28,260  -->  00:01:29,430
are still going to be valid
40

40

00:01:29,430  -->  00:01:32,280
for all the AWS Regions.
41

41

00:01:32,280  -->  00:01:33,810
So overall, it's much better for you
42

42

00:01:33,810  -->  00:01:37,020
to use token Version 2 than token Version 1.
43

43

00:01:37,020  -->  00:01:39,690
So if you have an error like this,
44

44

00:01:39,690  -->  00:01:41,130
which says, "Hey, you cannot, for example,
45

45

00:01:41,130  -->  00:01:44,250
describe your instances because AWS was not able
46

46

00:01:44,250  -->  00:01:47,010
to validate the provided access credentials."
47

47

00:01:47,010  -->  00:01:47,850
You have two options.
48

48

00:01:47,850  -->  00:01:49,590
This is an issue with STS.
49

49

00:01:49,590  -->  00:01:52,260
The first one is to use the Regional STS Endpoint
50

50

00:01:52,260  -->  00:01:53,400
in any region,
51

51

00:01:53,400  -->  00:01:56,130
which is going to return the STS Tokens Version 2.
52

52

00:01:56,130  -->  00:01:58,230
And then you use the closest regional endpoint
53

53

00:01:58,230  -->  00:02:00,120
for the lowest latency.
54

54

00:02:00,120  -->  00:02:03,840
The second one is to use the global endpoint,
55

55

00:02:03,840  -->  00:02:05,640
which is going to give you Version 1 Tokens,
56

56

00:02:05,640  -->  00:02:07,560
but you can actually change the setting
57

57

00:02:07,560  -->  00:02:08,850
on the global endpoint
58

58

00:02:08,850  -->  00:02:12,780
to start issuing you STS Tokens Version 2.
59

59

00:02:12,780  -->  00:02:14,430
So that's it for this lecture.
60

60

00:02:14,430  -->  00:02:15,690
It's an exam question.
61

61

00:02:15,690  -->  00:02:16,890
I hope you liked it,
62

62

00:02:16,890  -->  00:02:18,843
and I will see you in the next lecture.
