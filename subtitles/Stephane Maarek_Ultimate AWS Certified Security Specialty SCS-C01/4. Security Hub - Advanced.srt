1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:02,100
<v Instructor>So let's talk about some advanced concepts</v>
2

2

00:00:02,100  -->  00:00:03,930
on the AWS Security Hub.
3

3

00:00:03,930  -->  00:00:06,750
So first of all there's cross-Region aggregation
4

4

00:00:06,750  -->  00:00:08,850
that's possible for the Security Hub.
5

5

00:00:08,850  -->  00:00:10,410
That means that you can send data
6

6

00:00:10,410  -->  00:00:13,470
from different Regions in one central Region,
7

7

00:00:13,470  -->  00:00:18,470
which makes of course security administration a lot easier.
8

8

00:00:18,510  -->  00:00:20,910
On top of it, on top of cross-Region aggregation,
9

9

00:00:20,910  -->  00:00:24,000
we also have Organizations integration.
10

10

00:00:24,000  -->  00:00:26,340
So that means that you can manage all the accounts
11

11

00:00:26,340  -->  00:00:29,340
of Security Hub into one central accounts.
12

12

00:00:29,340  -->  00:00:30,270
So automatically,
13

13

00:00:30,270  -->  00:00:32,760
if new accounts are added into your Organization
14

14

00:00:32,760  -->  00:00:35,520
Security Hub will detect them and add them.
15

15

00:00:35,520  -->  00:00:38,820
And you can also have the management account by default
16

16

00:00:38,820  -->  00:00:40,260
as the Security Hub administrator.
17

17

00:00:40,260  -->  00:00:43,230
But you can also design one of the member accounts
18

18

00:00:43,230  -->  00:00:46,500
to be a designated delegated administrator
19

19

00:00:46,500  -->  00:00:48,450
for Security Hub.
20

20

00:00:48,450  -->  00:00:52,050
On top of it, you must enable AWS Config no matter what
21

21

00:00:52,050  -->  00:00:53,850
for Security Hub to work,
22

22

00:00:53,850  -->  00:00:58,350
because many of the security checks are using AWS Config.
23

23

00:00:58,350  -->  00:01:00,600
Also, you must make sure that Config
24

24

00:01:00,600  -->  00:01:03,060
is enabled on on all accounts, okay?
25

25

00:01:03,060  -->  00:01:06,240
And Security Hub does not manage your Config configuration.
26

26

00:01:06,240  -->  00:01:09,060
So make sure on your own that Config is enabled
27

27

00:01:09,060  -->  00:01:12,780
across all your member accounts in your Organizations.
28

28

00:01:12,780  -->  00:01:15,240
Now, Security Hub has a few security standards
29

29

00:01:15,240  -->  00:01:17,310
so it will just generate findings
30

30

00:01:17,310  -->  00:01:20,520
and continuous checks against all these standards.
31

31

00:01:20,520  -->  00:01:23,490
And for example, from the standard one that comes
32

32

00:01:23,490  -->  00:01:26,100
with your standard Security Hub
33

33

00:01:26,100  -->  00:01:30,480
we have the CIS AWS Foundations, PCI DSS,
34

34

00:01:30,480  -->  00:01:33,810
and the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices.
35

35

00:01:33,810  -->  00:01:36,210
And you could just enable it in the console,
36

36

00:01:36,210  -->  00:01:38,070
and it's possible for you to enable
37

37

00:01:38,070  -->  00:01:40,230
or disable a security standard.
38

38

00:01:40,230  -->  00:01:43,920
So let's have a look at the integrations with Security Hub.
39

39

00:01:43,920  -->  00:01:45,510
So of course you need to remember
40

40

00:01:45,510  -->  00:01:47,580
that GuardDuty generates findings,
41

41

00:01:47,580  -->  00:01:50,250
and these findings can be sent to Security Hub.
42

42

00:01:50,250  -->  00:01:52,080
So we just learned about GuardDuty.
43

43

00:01:52,080  -->  00:01:53,760
We saw some of these findings, for example,
44

44

00:01:53,760  -->  00:01:56,250
CloudTrail logging disabled, suspicious files,
45

45

00:01:56,250  -->  00:01:57,600
as I said, brute force.
46

46

00:01:57,600  -->  00:02:00,660
And these findings are going to be sent automatically
47

47

00:02:00,660  -->  00:02:04,350
for being dealt with in the Security Hub.
48

48

00:02:04,350  -->  00:02:06,000
So they're going to be converted to something
49

49

00:02:06,000  -->  00:02:08,250
called the ASFF format.
50

50

00:02:08,250  -->  00:02:10,500
The AWS Security Finding Format,
51

51

00:02:10,500  -->  00:02:12,450
just because this is what the Security Hub
52

52

00:02:12,450  -->  00:02:13,920
is using overall.
53

53

00:02:13,920  -->  00:02:16,260
Findings are usually sent within five minutes.
54

54

00:02:16,260  -->  00:02:19,170
And then if you archive a finding in GuardDuty,
55

55

00:02:19,170  -->  00:02:21,300
it doesn't mean that it will update the finding
56

56

00:02:21,300  -->  00:02:22,320
in Security Hub, okay?
57

57

00:02:22,320  -->  00:02:25,080
So make sure you manage the findings directly
58

58

00:02:25,080  -->  00:02:26,223
in Security Hub.
59

59

00:02:27,060  -->  00:02:28,590
Now for services integration.
60

60

00:02:28,590  -->  00:02:31,650
So not just GuardDuty can send data into the Security Hub,
61

61

00:02:31,650  -->  00:02:35,970
but a lot of them, so AWS Config, Firewall Manager,
62

62

00:02:35,970  -->  00:02:39,780
GuardDuty, Health, Access Analyzer for IAM,
63

63

00:02:39,780  -->  00:02:42,780
Inspector, IoT Device Defender, Macie,
64

64

00:02:42,780  -->  00:02:45,090
and the SSM Patch Manager, and maybe others
65

65

00:02:45,090  -->  00:02:48,720
in the future can send findings into the Security Hub.
66

66

00:02:48,720  -->  00:02:51,030
So it's really why it's called Security Hub.
67

67

00:02:51,030  -->  00:02:53,160
It's because it aggregates the security finding
68

68

00:02:53,160  -->  00:02:57,030
across all the different security services of AWS.
69

69

00:02:57,030  -->  00:02:59,250
And then to deal with these findings
70

70

00:02:59,250  -->  00:03:02,370
we have a couple of other services that receive them.
71

71

00:03:02,370  -->  00:03:04,260
So we have the Audit Manager,
72

72

00:03:04,260  -->  00:03:07,500
we have AWS Chatbot, we have Amazon Detective,
73

73

00:03:07,500  -->  00:03:11,763
we have Trusted Advisor, and SSM Explorer and OpsCenter.
74

74

00:03:13,380  -->  00:03:15,810
Next Security Hub can also receive data
75

75

00:03:15,810  -->  00:03:17,490
from third party integrations
76

76

00:03:17,490  -->  00:03:20,790
and actually also send data to other partners.
77

77

00:03:20,790  -->  00:03:22,890
So what is sending findings to Security Hub?
78

78

00:03:22,890  -->  00:03:27,810
Well, for example, these ones: 3CORESec, Alert Logic, Aqua.
79

79

00:03:27,810  -->  00:03:30,270
And to just enable these findings in Security Hub,
80

80

00:03:30,270  -->  00:03:33,150
you go in the console, you find the finding you want,
81

81

00:03:33,150  -->  00:03:34,860
and you find the partner you want,
82

82

00:03:34,860  -->  00:03:37,380
and you click on Accept Findings.
83

83

00:03:37,380  -->  00:03:40,200
And for example, for this one, is going to help you
84

84

00:03:40,200  -->  00:03:43,950
do intrusion detection systems and network forensics.
85

85

00:03:43,950  -->  00:03:45,540
You also have other services
86

86

00:03:45,540  -->  00:03:47,960
that can receive findings from Security Hub.
87

87

00:03:47,960  -->  00:03:49,800
So we aggregate data in Security Hub
88

88

00:03:49,800  -->  00:03:53,460
but then we send it to Atlassian, FireEye, or Fortinet
89

89

00:03:53,460  -->  00:03:56,610
because this is maybe where you manage your findings.
90

90

00:03:56,610  -->  00:04:00,390
And on top of it, some of these third party integrations
91

91

00:04:00,390  -->  00:04:02,310
can loop back into Security Hub
92

92

00:04:02,310  -->  00:04:05,190
and update the findings there so that they are archived.
93

93

00:04:05,190  -->  00:04:07,593
So for example, Atlassian or ServiceNow.
94

94

00:04:09,271  -->  00:04:11,280
Now for these findings, so they are always
95

95

00:04:11,280  -->  00:04:14,733
in the ASFF format, the security finding format of AWS,
96

96

00:04:15,600  -->  00:04:17,550
and automatically Security Hub
97

97

00:04:17,550  -->  00:04:19,620
is going to delete and update them.
98

98

00:04:19,620  -->  00:04:22,740
So if we look at these findings, so we,
99

99

00:04:22,740  -->  00:04:25,860
this is some of them that were being received in my console,
100

100

00:04:25,860  -->  00:04:29,490
for example, that I haven't rotated an IAM user access key
101

101

00:04:29,490  -->  00:04:33,720
in 90 days or that my password policy was not strong enough.
102

102

00:04:33,720  -->  00:04:36,630
And so therefore I can click on one of these findings
103

103

00:04:36,630  -->  00:04:39,480
and then I have a workflow and I can say it's new,
104

104

00:04:39,480  -->  00:04:41,610
I've been notified, it's been suppressed or resolved,
105

105

00:04:41,610  -->  00:04:43,620
so I can get more information
106

106

00:04:43,620  -->  00:04:46,140
and I can update my finding over time.
107

107

00:04:46,140  -->  00:04:49,740
If I don't deal with it, then automatically past 90 days
108

108

00:04:49,740  -->  00:04:51,960
the findings are going to be deleted.
109

109

00:04:51,960  -->  00:04:55,020
And in the console you can filter by Region, integration,
110

110

00:04:55,020  -->  00:04:57,930
security standards, and Insights.
111

111

00:04:57,930  -->  00:04:59,400
So what is an Insights?
112

112

00:04:59,400  -->  00:05:01,080
Well, we've seen that they are findings
113

113

00:05:01,080  -->  00:05:04,230
and they represent individual security issues,
114

114

00:05:04,230  -->  00:05:06,600
but there are Insights in Security Hub,
115

115

00:05:06,600  -->  00:05:08,760
and they are a collection of findings
116

116

00:05:08,760  -->  00:05:10,440
that identifies a security area
117

117

00:05:10,440  -->  00:05:13,470
that requires an attention and intervention.
118

118

00:05:13,470  -->  00:05:16,020
For example, if we find that many EC2 instances
119

119

00:05:16,020  -->  00:05:18,330
are having poor security practices,
120

120

00:05:18,330  -->  00:05:20,310
this can become an Insights.
121

121

00:05:20,310  -->  00:05:24,360
So Insights bring findings from across finding providers
122

122

00:05:24,360  -->  00:05:26,670
and each Insight is therefore defined by group
123

123

00:05:26,670  -->  00:05:28,950
by statements and optional filters.
124

124

00:05:28,950  -->  00:05:30,780
So you can define your own Insights.
125

125

00:05:30,780  -->  00:05:32,880
So you have the built-in managed Insights,
126

126

00:05:32,880  -->  00:05:35,580
and this is only giving you results
127

127

00:05:35,580  -->  00:05:38,310
for related product integration or security standards
128

128

00:05:38,310  -->  00:05:40,350
and you cannot edit or delete them.
129

129

00:05:40,350  -->  00:05:43,290
This comes as you enable security standards,
130

130

00:05:43,290  -->  00:05:45,930
but you can define your own custom Insight
131

131

00:05:45,930  -->  00:05:48,450
to track issues specific to your environment.
132

132

00:05:48,450  -->  00:05:50,370
For example, if you wanna track critical findings
133

133

00:05:50,370  -->  00:05:52,263
affecting member accounts.
134

134

00:05:53,730  -->  00:05:56,970
Security Hub also has some automation possible.
135

135

00:05:56,970  -->  00:05:59,160
So we can define custom actions,
136

136

00:05:59,160  -->  00:06:00,720
and thanks to custom actions,
137

137

00:06:00,720  -->  00:06:02,640
we can actually automate Security Hub
138

138

00:06:02,640  -->  00:06:04,530
with Amazon EventBridge.
139

139

00:06:04,530  -->  00:06:05,910
So we create a custom action
140

140

00:06:05,910  -->  00:06:08,430
and then we send it into EventBridge.
141

141

00:06:08,430  -->  00:06:10,890
And so this gives you possible response
142

142

00:06:10,890  -->  00:06:14,070
and remediation possibilities by using Amazon EventBridge.
143

143

00:06:14,070  -->  00:06:17,940
So you have in EventBridge, you have to define a event type
144

144

00:06:17,940  -->  00:06:20,940
of type Security Hub findings, custom action.
145

145

00:06:20,940  -->  00:06:22,590
So it's better to go through an architecture
146

146

00:06:22,590  -->  00:06:24,480
for you to understand what I mean.
147

147

00:06:24,480  -->  00:06:27,690
So in this example, we have the Security Hub administrator
148

148

00:06:27,690  -->  00:06:29,400
in a security account
149

149

00:06:29,400  -->  00:06:31,680
which could be the delegated administrator.
150

150

00:06:31,680  -->  00:06:33,360
And then we have our workloads accounts
151

151

00:06:33,360  -->  00:06:35,460
where we have member for Security Hub.
152

152

00:06:35,460  -->  00:06:39,120
So for example, say we have Amazon Macie that's enabled
153

153

00:06:39,120  -->  00:06:42,900
and it's monitoring an S3 bucket for PII data,
154

154

00:06:42,900  -->  00:06:44,130
and it detects some.
155

155

00:06:44,130  -->  00:06:45,690
So it's going to create a finding
156

156

00:06:45,690  -->  00:06:47,760
in the Security Hub and that finding
157

157

00:06:47,760  -->  00:06:49,230
is going to be aggregated back
158

158

00:06:49,230  -->  00:06:51,480
into the administrator accounts.
159

159

00:06:51,480  -->  00:06:54,660
From there, we can trigger a Security Hub custom action,
160

160

00:06:54,660  -->  00:06:56,430
which is going to pass down that event
161

161

00:06:56,430  -->  00:06:58,590
into Amazon EventBridge.
162

162

00:06:58,590  -->  00:07:01,350
From EventBridge, just have a Lambda function,
163

163

00:07:01,350  -->  00:07:03,420
and that Lambda function can, for example,
164

164

00:07:03,420  -->  00:07:07,470
remediate either the S3 buckets or the S3 objects
165

165

00:07:07,470  -->  00:07:08,670
based on the code you want
166

166

00:07:08,670  -->  00:07:11,460
and on the action you've defined and implemented.
167

167

00:07:11,460  -->  00:07:14,280
And then resolve the finding itself
168

168

00:07:14,280  -->  00:07:16,410
in the member Security Hub.
169

169

00:07:16,410  -->  00:07:17,243
And you're good.
170

170

00:07:17,243  -->  00:07:20,640
And you have automated the processing
171

171

00:07:20,640  -->  00:07:22,340
of the findings from Amazon Macie.
172

172

00:07:23,580  -->  00:07:27,390
Another option, and this is a bit more, you know, general,
173

173

00:07:27,390  -->  00:07:31,230
is we have again a workload account and a security accounts.
174

174

00:07:31,230  -->  00:07:33,660
The events are going to be aggregated.
175

175

00:07:33,660  -->  00:07:35,430
And then we have the detection phase
176

176

00:07:35,430  -->  00:07:37,830
where we are going to trigger stuff in Security Hub
177

177

00:07:37,830  -->  00:07:39,360
and custom actions.
178

178

00:07:39,360  -->  00:07:41,280
The ingestion phase where all these events
179

179

00:07:41,280  -->  00:07:43,830
are going to flow into Amazon EventBridge,
180

180

00:07:43,830  -->  00:07:46,230
the remediation phase where, for example,
181

181

00:07:46,230  -->  00:07:49,320
you have Lambda functions or Step Functions workflow
182

182

00:07:49,320  -->  00:07:52,380
that can be triggered from Amazon EventBridge.
183

183

00:07:52,380  -->  00:07:54,600
And then based, for example, on the Step Function,
184

184

00:07:54,600  -->  00:07:57,780
you can have any kind of way to remediate.
185

185

00:07:57,780  -->  00:08:00,510
So it could be, for example, using SSM automations,
186

186

00:08:00,510  -->  00:08:03,000
which at the end of the day will mark the findings
187

187

00:08:03,000  -->  00:08:04,890
as a result in the Security Hub.
188

188

00:08:04,890  -->  00:08:08,190
And then you need to log these actions.
189

189

00:08:08,190  -->  00:08:12,180
So SNS or CloudWatch logs are great locations for that.
190

190

00:08:12,180  -->  00:08:14,100
So this is just a general architecture,
191

191

00:08:14,100  -->  00:08:17,640
but remember, detect, ingest, remediate, and log.
192

192

00:08:17,640  -->  00:08:19,380
All right, that's it for Security Hub.
193

193

00:08:19,380  -->  00:08:22,383
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
