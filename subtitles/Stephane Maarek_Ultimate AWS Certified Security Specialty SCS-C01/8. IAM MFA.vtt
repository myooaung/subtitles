00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:01.560
<v Instructor>So, now, let's talk about MFA</v>
2

2

00:00:01.560  -->  00:00:03.900
or Multi-Factor Authentication.
3

3

00:00:03.900  -->  00:00:06.180
So users have access to your account
4

4

00:00:06.180  -->  00:00:07.920
and they can possibly change configurations
5

5

00:00:07.920  -->  00:00:09.390
or delete resources in your account.
6

6

00:00:09.390  -->  00:00:12.090
And so you want to make sure that you're going to protect
7

7

00:00:12.090  -->  00:00:15.360
your Root Accounts and your IAM users.
8

8

00:00:15.360  -->  00:00:18.270
So MFA implies that you have a password
9

9

00:00:18.270  -->  00:00:20.523
you know to log into AWS,
10

10

00:00:21.390  -->  00:00:23.670
and then a security device you own
11

11

00:00:23.670  -->  00:00:24.780
that's going to give you a code
12

12

00:00:24.780  -->  00:00:26.430
that allows you to do the login.
13

13

00:00:26.430  -->  00:00:27.720
So Alice has a Password
14

14

00:00:27.720  -->  00:00:30.330
and then, thanks to the device you own,
15

15

00:00:30.330  -->  00:00:33.360
for example, your phone or a security key or whatever,
16

16

00:00:33.360  -->  00:00:36.270
then you're going to get a Successful login.
17

17

00:00:36.270  -->  00:00:37.860
So the main benefit of MFA
18

18

00:00:37.860  -->  00:00:40.050
is that even if you lose your password,
19

19

00:00:40.050  -->  00:00:42.630
then the account is not compromised.
20

20

00:00:42.630  -->  00:00:44.310
The hacker will still need to be able to access
21

21

00:00:44.310  -->  00:00:46.680
your MFA device, which is very unlikely,
22

22

00:00:46.680  -->  00:00:48.270
to access your account.
23

23

00:00:48.270  -->  00:00:49.890
So you have different options in AWS,
24

24

00:00:49.890  -->  00:00:51.780
you have a Virtual MFA device,
25

25

00:00:51.780  -->  00:00:55.050
which is something like Google Authenticator or Authy,
26

26

00:00:55.050  -->  00:00:56.280
and you can have support
27

27

00:00:56.280  -->  00:00:58.200
for multiple tokens on a single device.
28

28

00:00:58.200  -->  00:01:01.230
So you just register a service and then it gives you a code,
29

29

00:01:01.230  -->  00:01:03.780
or you can use, for example, a security key,
30

30

00:01:03.780  -->  00:01:05.100
such as a YubiKey,
31

31

00:01:05.100  -->  00:01:06.750
which supports for multiple root
32

32

00:01:06.750  -->  00:01:10.260
and IAM users using a single security key.
33

33

00:01:10.260  -->  00:01:13.710
You also have the hardware type of MFA devices.
34

34

00:01:13.710  -->  00:01:16.350
So, for example, one by Gemalto which gives you a code,
35

35

00:01:16.350  -->  00:01:19.380
or you have the Hardware Key Fob MFA Device
36

36

00:01:19.380  -->  00:01:23.700
for AWS GovCloud which is provided by SurePassID,
37

37

00:01:23.700  -->  00:01:25.200
and again, gives you a code
38

38

00:01:25.200  -->  00:01:27.570
that you just enter while logging in.
39

39

00:01:27.570  -->  00:01:29.370
So, why do I talk about MFA?
40

40

00:01:29.370  -->  00:01:31.860
Well, because, thanks to MFA, we can have conditions,
41

41

00:01:31.860  -->  00:01:35.190
and the first one is around Amazon S3-MFA Delete.
42

42

00:01:35.190  -->  00:01:37.200
So if you enable MFA Delete,
43

43

00:01:37.200  -->  00:01:40.440
you force users to generate a code on a device
44

44

00:01:40.440  -->  00:01:43.860
before doing important operations on Amazon S3.
45

45

00:01:43.860  -->  00:01:46.290
So MFA can be required, for example,
46

46

00:01:46.290  -->  00:01:48.480
to permanently delete an object version,
47

47

00:01:48.480  -->  00:01:51.390
because this is a destructive type of operation,
48

48

00:01:51.390  -->  00:01:54.150
or suspend Versioning on the bucket.
49

49

00:01:54.150  -->  00:01:56.970
But MFA for MFA Delete is not going to be required
50

50

00:01:56.970  -->  00:02:00.090
for enabling Versioning or listing deleted version,
51

51

00:02:00.090  -->  00:02:04.770
so less dangerous API calls, let's say.
52

52

00:02:04.770  -->  00:02:06.420
So, to use MFA Delete,
53

53

00:02:06.420  -->  00:02:09.330
you must first enable Versioning on the bucket.
54

54

00:02:09.330  -->  00:02:12.510
And only the bucket owner, so the root account,
55

55

00:02:12.510  -->  00:02:15.810
can enable or disable MFA Delete.
56

56

00:02:15.810  -->  00:02:19.920
The other way to use MFA is around IAM Conditions
57

57

00:02:19.920  -->  00:02:22.980
with the condition MultiFactorAuthPresent.
58

58

00:02:22.980  -->  00:02:25.380
So here we have an IAM policy
59

59

00:02:25.380  -->  00:02:28.410
which allows everything on ec2.
60

60

00:02:28.410  -->  00:02:31.560
But then the second statement is quite interesting.
61

61

00:02:31.560  -->  00:02:33.930
So we're saying that we cannot stop
62

62

00:02:33.930  -->  00:02:36.090
or terminate the instances
63

63

00:02:36.090  -->  00:02:39.750
if we have MultiFactorAuthPresent: false.
64

64

00:02:39.750  -->  00:02:41.700
So that means that if we don't have MFA,
65

65

00:02:41.700  -->  00:02:43.980
we cannot stop or terminate instances.
66

66

00:02:43.980  -->  00:02:45.870
And that makes sense, it's very secure because,
67

67

00:02:45.870  -->  00:02:47.610
well, you want to make sure your users
68

68

00:02:47.610  -->  00:02:49.740
are authenticated using MFA.
69

69

00:02:49.740  -->  00:02:51.750
So we'll use this Boolean condition,
70

70

00:02:51.750  -->  00:02:54.330
and then we'll restrict very dangerous operations,
71

71

00:02:54.330  -->  00:02:57.390
such as stopping an instance or terminating an instance.
72

72

00:02:57.390  -->  00:02:59.610
And it's compatible with the Console,
73

73

00:02:59.610  -->  00:03:01.683
but also compatible with the CLI.
74

74

00:03:03.270  -->  00:03:08.220
You also have a very important edge case with MFA.
75

75

00:03:08.220  -->  00:03:11.107
You're going to get sometimes an error message saying,
76

76

00:03:11.107  -->  00:03:14.427
"Not Authorized to Perform the iam:DeleteVirtualMFADevice."
77

77

00:03:16.050  -->  00:03:18.840
So this happens even though the user
78

78

00:03:18.840  -->  00:03:20.640
has the correct permissions to delete
79

79

00:03:20.640  -->  00:03:22.590
this Virtual MFA Device.
80

80

00:03:22.590  -->  00:03:25.110
So you make an API Call to delete it
81

81

00:03:25.110  -->  00:03:27.300
and then you're not authorized.
82

82

00:03:27.300  -->  00:03:30.870
So this is a very small edge case in AWS,
83

83

00:03:30.870  -->  00:03:32.610
but you need to know about it for the exam.
84

84

00:03:32.610  -->  00:03:34.650
And this happens if someone began
85

85

00:03:34.650  -->  00:03:37.170
assigning a virtual MFA device to a user,
86

86

00:03:37.170  -->  00:03:39.240
but then canceled the process.
87

87

00:03:39.240  -->  00:03:42.330
So, for example, you created an MFA device for a user
88

88

00:03:42.330  -->  00:03:44.310
but you never activated it.
89

89

00:03:44.310  -->  00:03:45.630
Then what you need to do is, of course,
90

90

00:03:45.630  -->  00:03:47.880
delete the existing MFA device,
91

91

00:03:47.880  -->  00:03:50.670
and then associate a new device.
92

92

00:03:50.670  -->  00:03:53.160
And to prevent this thing,
93

93

00:03:53.160  -->  00:03:56.520
you can have a policy that allows a user
94

94

00:03:56.520  -->  00:03:58.410
to delete their own MFA device
95

95

00:03:58.410  -->  00:04:01.980
if they are already authenticated with MFA.
96

96

00:04:01.980  -->  00:04:04.980
So if you are getting into this kind of issue,
97

97

00:04:04.980  -->  00:04:06.630
then the only option out of it
98

98

00:04:06.630  -->  00:04:09.330
is to have the administrator to use the CLI
99

99

00:04:09.330  -->  00:04:12.480
or the APIs of AWS to remove the existing
100

100

00:04:12.480  -->  00:04:13.890
but deactivated device.
101

101

00:04:13.890  -->  00:04:16.230
So the administrator is the one to delete
102

102

00:04:16.230  -->  00:04:19.440
the virtual MFA device and then you're unstuck.
103

103

00:04:19.440  -->  00:04:21.780
So it's a weird one, I know,
104

104

00:04:21.780  -->  00:04:23.190
but something that can come up in the exam,
105

105

00:04:23.190  -->  00:04:24.240
and that's the answer.
106

106

00:04:24.240  -->  00:04:27.150
The admin has to delete the virtual MFA device.
107

107

00:04:27.150  -->  00:04:28.380
Alright, that's it for this lecture.
108

108

00:04:28.380  -->  00:04:31.380
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
