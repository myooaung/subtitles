00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:00,953
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about</v>
2

2

00:00:00,953  -->  00:00:02,880
Amazon WorkSpaces security.
3

3

00:00:02,880  -->  00:00:05,580
The first one is the IP Access Control Group.
4

4

00:00:05,580  -->  00:00:07,410
They're very similar to security groups
5

5

00:00:07,410  -->  00:00:09,540
but they are for WorkSpaces.
6

6

00:00:09,540  -->  00:00:12,990
So you list the IP addresses or the CIDR address ranges
7

7

00:00:12,990  -->  00:00:15,450
that users are authorized to connect from
8

8

00:00:15,450  -->  00:00:18,420
and then they will be accessing WorkSpaces.
9

9

00:00:18,420  -->  00:00:20,700
If the users are accessing WorkSpaces
10

10

00:00:20,700  -->  00:00:22,500
through a VPN or a NAT
11

11

00:00:22,500  -->  00:00:25,950
then you need to make sure that the IP Access Control Group
12

12

00:00:25,950  -->  00:00:29,460
authorize the public IP of your VPN or your NAT.
13

13

00:00:29,460  -->  00:00:31,410
So if you have a corporate data center,
14

14

00:00:31,410  -->  00:00:34,680
a user has a public IP from the CIDR that's owned
15

15

00:00:34,680  -->  00:00:36,000
by the data center
16

16

00:00:36,000  -->  00:00:39,600
and then we have WorkSpaces with an IP Access Control Group.
17

17

00:00:39,600  -->  00:00:42,660
We'll just authorize the CIDR of our data center
18

18

00:00:42,660  -->  00:00:44,520
and we're good to go.
19

19

00:00:44,520  -->  00:00:47,280
We also have access control options and trusted devices.
20

20

00:00:47,280  -->  00:00:51,420
So we manage which client devices can access WorkSpaces
21

21

00:00:51,420  -->  00:00:55,290
and we can use WorkSpaces certificates based authentication
22

22

00:00:55,290  -->  00:00:57,930
to limit access to only trusted devices
23

23

00:00:57,930  -->  00:00:59,820
using digital certificates
24

24

00:00:59,820  -->  00:01:03,960
and this works for Windows, MacOS and Android clients.
25

25

00:01:03,960  -->  00:01:08,040
So we have our user and we are issued a certificate
26

26

00:01:08,040  -->  00:01:10,140
by our administrator,
27

27

00:01:10,140  -->  00:01:13,530
and then we are going to authenticate with WorkSpaces
28

28

00:01:13,530  -->  00:01:16,620
using that certificate which prevents malicious users
29

29

00:01:16,620  -->  00:01:19,680
from accessing our WorkSpaces directory.
30

30

00:01:19,680  -->  00:01:21,660
That's it for WorkSpaces security.
31

31

00:01:21,660  -->  00:01:24,693
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
