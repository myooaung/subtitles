00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:01,710
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about</v>
2

2

00:00:02,610  -->  00:00:03,840
the EC2 serial console feature.
3

3

00:00:03,840  -->  00:00:06,480
So the serial console is a very special kind
4

4

00:00:06,480  -->  00:00:10,200
of terminal capability into your EC2 instances,
5

5

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:12,810
because it allows you to troubleshoot the boot,
6

6

00:00:12,810  -->  00:00:15,030
troubleshoot the network configuration,
7

7

00:00:15,030  -->  00:00:16,920
and analyze reboot issues.
8

8

00:00:16,920  -->  00:00:20,070
So it has a very specific use case, and the idea is,
9

9

00:00:20,070  -->  00:00:25,020
that we access the EC2 instance over its own serial port.
10

10

00:00:25,020  -->  00:00:27,450
So, a serial port is what you would have,
11

11

00:00:27,450  -->  00:00:29,550
if you wanted to hook up a monitor,
12

12

00:00:29,550  -->  00:00:32,820
or a keyboard, directly into the EC2 instance.
13

13

00:00:32,820  -->  00:00:34,350
So, that looks just like this.
14

14

00:00:34,350  -->  00:00:36,300
Obviously this, no one goes
15

15

00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:39,390
into the data centers of AWS and actually plugs it
16

16

00:00:39,390  -->  00:00:41,310
into the serial console, the serial port.
17

17

00:00:41,310  -->  00:00:44,280
But this is the kind of thing you need to think about.
18

18

00:00:44,280  -->  00:00:47,310
So, it does not require any network capability,
19

19

00:00:47,310  -->  00:00:51,360
because you access the instance through the serial port.
20

20

00:00:51,360  -->  00:00:54,930
So, it only works with the specific kind of EC2 instances.
21

21

00:00:54,930  -->  00:00:57,780
They're the Nitro-based EC2 instances.
22

22

00:00:57,780  -->  00:00:59,760
And for this to work, you're going to log into
23

23

00:00:59,760  -->  00:01:03,600
your EC2 instance, with a user and a password.
24

24

00:01:03,600  -->  00:01:05,340
So, you need to set a user and a password
25

25

00:01:05,340  -->  00:01:08,160
before you can use the serial console.
26

26

00:01:08,160  -->  00:01:12,030
Okay, next, because there is only one serial console part,
27

27

00:01:12,030  -->  00:01:14,550
you can only have one active session per EC2 instance.
28

28

00:01:14,550  -->  00:01:16,080
That may be an oversimplification,
29

29

00:01:16,080  -->  00:01:18,780
but you get the idea, and the serial console,
30

30

00:01:18,780  -->  00:01:22,230
because it has very strong and powerful capabilities,
31

31

00:01:22,230  -->  00:01:24,750
is disabled, by default, in your accounts,
32

32

00:01:24,750  -->  00:01:25,860
but you can enable it,
33

33

00:01:25,860  -->  00:01:29,040
by going into the accounts EC2 settings.
34

34

00:01:29,040  -->  00:01:30,630
So, this was a short explanation
35

35

00:01:30,630  -->  00:01:32,130
about the EC2 serial console.
36

36

00:01:32,130  -->  00:01:35,580
And just remember, it is meant to analyze boot issues,
37

37

00:01:35,580  -->  00:01:37,950
network configuration issues, and reboot issues,
38

38

00:01:37,950  -->  00:01:39,720
because if you reboot your EC2 instance,
39

39

00:01:39,720  -->  00:01:41,850
you will still have that, quote-unquote,
40

40

00:01:41,850  -->  00:01:44,040
term terminal console opened,
41

41

00:01:44,040  -->  00:01:47,340
which allows you to troubleshoot this kind of issues.
42

42

00:01:47,340  -->  00:01:48,450
All right, that's it.
43

43

00:01:48,450  -->  00:01:51,450
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
