00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:03.390
<v Instructor>So here is a quick lecture about Amazon SES</v>
2

2

00:00:03.390  -->  00:00:06.120
also called Simple Email Service.
3

3

00:00:06.120  -->  00:00:08.280
So it's a fully managed service as the name indicates
4

4

00:00:08.280  -->  00:00:10.860
that will allow you to send email securely,
5

5

00:00:10.860  -->  00:00:12.840
globally, and at scale.
6

6

00:00:12.840  -->  00:00:16.830
So the idea is that your application will use the SES API,
7

7

00:00:16.830  -->  00:00:21.030
or SMTP server, and Amazon SES will then send bulk emails
8

8

00:00:21.030  -->  00:00:22.050
to users.
9

9

00:00:22.050  -->  00:00:24.600
So this allows for outbound and inbound emails,
10

10

00:00:24.600  -->  00:00:26.280
so you can receive replies,
11

11

00:00:26.280  -->  00:00:27.990
and it gives you a reputation dashboard
12

12

00:00:27.990  -->  00:00:29.910
if your emails are open or not,
13

13

00:00:29.910  -->  00:00:32.880
performance insights, as well as anti-spam feedback,
14

14

00:00:32.880  -->  00:00:35.430
so if people write your emails as spam or not.
15

15

00:00:35.430  -->  00:00:39.150
It provides email statistics such as deliveries, bounces,
16

16

00:00:39.150  -->  00:00:40.830
feedback loop results, and whether or not
17

17

00:00:40.830  -->  00:00:42.300
the email was open.
18

18

00:00:42.300  -->  00:00:43.920
And it supports the standard security
19

19

00:00:43.920  -->  00:00:45.690
for email sending of today,
20

20

00:00:45.690  -->  00:00:49.053
so you have DKIAM and you have SPF.
21

21

00:00:50.160  -->  00:00:53.460
There is a flexible deployment, so you can use a shared IP
22

22

00:00:53.460  -->  00:00:56.640
a dedicated IP, or your own customer owned IP,
23

23

00:00:56.640  -->  00:01:00.180
this is to send emails from a specific IP address.
24

24

00:01:00.180  -->  00:01:03.900
And then the APIs are accessible from the console
25

25

00:01:03.900  -->  00:01:07.620
specific AWS APIs, or the SMTP protocol.
26

26

00:01:07.620  -->  00:01:10.080
So the use cases for Amazon SES
27

27

00:01:10.080  -->  00:01:12.630
will be transactional emails, marketing email,
28

28

00:01:12.630  -->  00:01:15.540
and bulk emails communications.
29

29

00:01:15.540  -->  00:01:18.060
The next feature you need to know about for Amazon SES
30

30

00:01:18.060  -->  00:01:19.950
is configuration sets.
31

31

00:01:19.950  -->  00:01:22.920
So it's a way for you to customize and analyze
32

32

00:01:22.920  -->  00:01:25.800
your email send events on Amazon SES.
33

33

00:01:25.800  -->  00:01:27.120
So there are two things you can set,
34

34

00:01:27.120  -->  00:01:30.060
you can set number one, the event destinations
35

35

00:01:30.060  -->  00:01:31.020
and you have two of them,
36

36

00:01:31.020  -->  00:01:33.360
you have Kinesis Data Firehose,
37

37

00:01:33.360  -->  00:01:34.920
so that Firehose receives metrics,
38

38

00:01:34.920  -->  00:01:37.830
such as the number of sends, deliveries, opens, clicks,
39

39

00:01:37.830  -->  00:01:40.710
bounces, and complaints for each email.
40

40

00:01:40.710  -->  00:01:43.110
Or SNS which gives you immediate feedback
41

41

00:01:43.110  -->  00:01:45.510
on bounce and complaint information.
42

42

00:01:45.510  -->  00:01:48.570
So the first part of configuration sets,
43

43

00:01:48.570  -->  00:01:51.690
and the second part if you want to is IP pool management
44

44

00:01:51.690  -->  00:01:55.080
to use IP pools to send particular types of emails,
45

45

00:01:55.080  -->  00:01:58.770
therefore, for example, that you have one IP set
46

46

00:01:58.770  -->  00:02:01.890
for the transactional emails,
47

47

00:02:01.890  -->  00:02:04.560
and one IP set for your marketing emails,
48

48

00:02:04.560  -->  00:02:07.740
therefore creating two types of email reputations.
49

49

00:02:07.740  -->  00:02:10.650
So Amazon and SES can have config sets, as I said,
50

50

00:02:10.650  -->  00:02:13.350
so when you send emails to users,
51

51

00:02:13.350  -->  00:02:16.170
then the analytics will be sent in real time
52

52

00:02:16.170  -->  00:02:18.480
or at least the data behind the analytics
53

53

00:02:18.480  -->  00:02:21.990
will be sent in near real time to Kinesis Data Firehose.
54

54

00:02:21.990  -->  00:02:24.360
And then you will have near real time analytics
55

55

00:02:24.360  -->  00:02:26.760
using Kinesis Data Analytics if you wanted to,
56

56

00:02:26.760  -->  00:02:28.890
or you can set it to Amazon S3,
57

57

00:02:28.890  -->  00:02:32.550
so that you can run queries on it with Amazon Athena.
58

58

00:02:32.550  -->  00:02:34.860
And finally, if you want to have immediate feedback
59

59

00:02:34.860  -->  00:02:36.630
on bounce and complaint information,
60

60

00:02:36.630  -->  00:02:39.360
you could set up an Amazon SNS topic
61

61

00:02:39.360  -->  00:02:42.090
to receive this kind of notifications.
62

62

00:02:42.090  -->  00:02:44.460
Okay, So that's it for Amazon SES,
63

63

00:02:44.460  -->  00:02:47.523
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
