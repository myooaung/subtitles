One thing that I think is really cool and worth doing is that if you're not a native English speaker
1

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,920
like me I'm French then you can request a special exam accommodation that will allow you to get an extra
2

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,630
30 minutes on your end of a certification exams.
3

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,710
So I'm going to click on request accommodation and for the request type I can say what I want and what
4

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,110
I want is ESL plus 30 minutes this is available only to non native English speakers.
5

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,410
While taking an exam in English.
6

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,030
Okay.
7

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,230
And you only need to apply once and it will apply for all future exam registrations.
8

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,210
So we have ESL plus 30 minutes.
9

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,140
This is great.
10

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,540
And then I click on Create and here we go.
11

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,050
I have requested my extra 30 minutes for my exams so it will go ahead and be approved directly.
12

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,820
So here we go.
13

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,000
And it doesn't expire.
14

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,670
And so this is only for future exams so if you have somehow booked an exam before applying for this
15

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,090
exam accommodation please make sure to cancel your request this is free and then rebook your exam afterwards
16

17
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,010
and this will get applied the 30 minutes extra to your exam as well.
17

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,360
All right.
18

19
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,750
So that's it for this lecture.
19

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,400
Hope you liked it.
20

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,670
And good luck for your exam.
21

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,030
I will see you in the next lecture.
