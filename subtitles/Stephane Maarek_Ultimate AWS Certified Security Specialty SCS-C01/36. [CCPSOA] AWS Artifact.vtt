00:00:00.130  -->  00:00:02.130
<v ->Now let's talk about AWS Artifact,</v>
2

2

00:00:02.130  -->  00:00:04.830
which is not really a service, but presented as one.
3

3

00:00:04.830  -->  00:00:06.862
So this is a portal that will provide you
4

4

00:00:06.862  -->  00:00:09.620
with on-demand access to compliance documentation
5

5

00:00:09.620  -->  00:00:12.710
from AWS, as well as AWS agreement.
6

6

00:00:12.710  -->  00:00:15.620
So these reports are allowing you to download
7

7

00:00:15.620  -->  00:00:17.140
security and compliance documents,
8

8

00:00:17.140  -->  00:00:20.088
such as the AWS ISO certifications,
9

9

00:00:20.088  -->  00:00:21.792
the PCI reports,
10

10

00:00:21.792  -->  00:00:24.610
and the SOC reports from AWS.
11

11

00:00:24.610  -->  00:00:26.090
Also, you can get agreements
12

12

00:00:26.090  -->  00:00:28.380
so you can get access such to agreements,
13

13

00:00:28.380  -->  00:00:30.560
such as the Business Associate Addendum,
14

14

00:00:30.560  -->  00:00:32.370
or BAA document.
15

15

00:00:32.370  -->  00:00:35.920 line:15% 
These documents can be helpful if you have an internal audit
16

16

00:00:35.920  -->  00:00:38.853 line:15% 
or need to show the compliance of your IT department.
17

17

00:00:40.240  -->  00:00:43.537
So if you go into Artifact for AWS.
18

18

00:00:46.480  -->  00:00:49.220
As we can see, this is a global service,
19

19

00:00:49.220  -->  00:00:51.100
and we can get started with Artifact.
20

20

00:00:51.100  -->  00:00:52.470
We can view the reports,
21

21

00:00:52.470  -->  00:00:54.260
or view the agreements.
22

22

00:00:54.260  -->  00:00:57.600
So if I click on reports, I can see 61 reports right now
23

23

00:00:57.600  -->  00:00:58.630
that I can download.
24

24

00:00:58.630  -->  00:00:59.827
For example, I can say,
25

25

00:00:59.827  -->  00:01:01.990
"Oh, I really want to get this report right now.
26

26

00:01:01.990  -->  00:01:03.470
I'm going to download it."
27

27

00:01:03.470  -->  00:01:06.320
And I say, "Okay, I accept the NDA,"
28

28

00:01:06.320  -->  00:01:08.120
and then I download this report.
29

29

00:01:08.120  -->  00:01:08.953
And here I am.
30

30

00:01:08.953  -->  00:01:11.880
I have a report that I can use for compliance internally.
31

31

00:01:11.880  -->  00:01:14.320
Or also, I can go into Agreements
32

32

00:01:14.320  -->  00:01:15.780
and find different agreements.
33

33

00:01:15.780  -->  00:01:17.353
For example, three account agreements,
34

34

00:01:17.353  -->  00:01:19.690
and we don't have any organization agreements.
35

35

00:01:19.690  -->  00:01:21.770
So I can take one of these agreement,
36

36

00:01:21.770  -->  00:01:22.610
for example, this one,
37

37

00:01:22.610  -->  00:01:23.860
the BAA agreement,
38

38

00:01:23.860  -->  00:01:25.300
accept the agreement,
39

39

00:01:25.300  -->  00:01:26.670
and then download it.
40

40

00:01:26.670  -->  00:01:27.630
I'll scroll down,
41

41

00:01:27.630  -->  00:01:28.660
I accept it,
42

42

00:01:28.660  -->  00:01:30.170
and then I download it.
43

43

00:01:30.170  -->  00:01:31.600
So it's very, very simple.
44

44

00:01:31.600  -->  00:01:32.710
It's not really a service,
45

45

00:01:32.710  -->  00:01:34.760
it's a way for you to download compliance document.
46

46

00:01:34.760  -->  00:01:35.950
I just wanted to show you once,
47

47

00:01:35.950  -->  00:01:37.240
then you have to remember it.
48

48

00:01:37.240  -->  00:01:38.520
And that will be it for this lecture.
49

49

00:01:38.520  -->  00:01:40.323
I will see you in the next lecture.
