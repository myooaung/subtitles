00:00:00.540  -->  00:00:03.240
<v Man>Now let's talk about the AWS Security Hub.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.240  -->  00:00:07.000
So this is a way for you to have a central security tool
3

3

00:00:07.000  -->  00:00:09.850
to manage security across different AWS accounts,
4

4

00:00:09.850  -->  00:00:11.960
so, several ones in their organization maybe,
5

5

00:00:11.960  -->  00:00:13.870
and automate security checks.
6

6

00:00:13.870  -->  00:00:15.490
It gives you an integrated dashboard
7

7

00:00:15.490  -->  00:00:17.300
that was going to show you the current security
8

8

00:00:17.300  -->  00:00:20.060
and compliance status to quickly take actions.
9

9

00:00:20.060  -->  00:00:22.430
The idea is that it's going to aggregate alerts
10

10

00:00:22.430  -->  00:00:24.930
in a bunch of different services and partner tools
11

11

00:00:24.930  -->  00:00:28.020
such as GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie,
12

12

00:00:28.020  -->  00:00:31.710
the IAM Access Analyzer, Systems Manager, Firewall Manager,
13

13

00:00:31.710  -->  00:00:33.580
and Partner Network Solutions.
14

14

00:00:33.580  -->  00:00:37.090
And across multiple accounts, and give you all these alerts
15

15

00:00:37.090  -->  00:00:39.940
into one central place called the Security Hub.
16

16

00:00:39.940  -->  00:00:42.450
There's really a need here to centralize all
17

17

00:00:42.450  -->  00:00:44.180
these security findings into one place
18

18

00:00:44.180  -->  00:00:46.710
so that your team can be way better organized
19

19

00:00:46.710  -->  00:00:49.710
and can take actions based on these security alerts.
20

20

00:00:49.710  -->  00:00:52.030
And for Security Hub to work in the first place,
21

21

00:00:52.030  -->  00:00:55.910
you need to first enable the AWS Config Service.
22

22

00:00:55.910  -->  00:00:57.790
So if we look at the Security Hub right here,
23

23

00:00:57.790  -->  00:00:58.970
as we can see in this diagram,
24

24

00:00:58.970  -->  00:01:00.180
it is made for multi accounts,
25

25

00:01:00.180  -->  00:01:03.460
so anytime in the exam you see security centralized place
26

26

00:01:03.460  -->  00:01:06.070
in multiple accounts, think about Security Hub.
27

27

00:01:06.070  -->  00:01:08.100
And it's going to analyze events from Macie,
28

28

00:01:08.100  -->  00:01:10.580
GuardDuty, Inspector, Firewall Manager,
29

29

00:01:10.580  -->  00:01:13.070
IAM Access Analyzer, Systems Manager,
30

30

00:01:13.070  -->  00:01:14.720
and it's going to look at all of those,
31

31

00:01:14.720  -->  00:01:16.950
collect potential issues and and findings,
32

32

00:01:16.950  -->  00:01:19.430
and summarize them in the Security Hub.
33

33

00:01:19.430  -->  00:01:21.590
Then the checks are going to be automated
34

34

00:01:21.590  -->  00:01:24.590
and they're going to appear in the Security Hub dashboards.
35

35

00:01:24.590  -->  00:01:27.290
But, also, events are going to be generated
36

36

00:01:27.290  -->  00:01:30.650
in the EventBridge service, so CloudWatch events.
37

37

00:01:30.650  -->  00:01:34.130
And finally, if you want to investigate these events,
38

38

00:01:34.130  -->  00:01:35.590
then as we'll see in the next lecture,
39

39

00:01:35.590  -->  00:01:37.750
we can use the Amazon Detective service
40

40

00:01:37.750  -->  00:01:40.670
to get down to the root cause of what happened.
41

41

00:01:40.670  -->  00:01:43.470
So the idea here is AWS gives you an integrated view
42

42

00:01:43.470  -->  00:01:45.560
and make it way simpler for users
43

43

00:01:45.560  -->  00:01:48.133
to find security issues and remediate them.
44

44

00:01:49.480  -->  00:01:51.640
In AWS we can see the Security Hub,
45

45

00:01:51.640  -->  00:01:54.060
we can see there's a pricing per check,
46

46

00:01:54.060  -->  00:01:58.030
so the first 1,000 checks cost you this much, and so on.
47

47

00:01:58.030  -->  00:01:59.200
The more checks you look,
48

48

00:01:59.200  -->  00:02:01.430
the more pricing you're going to have.
49

49

00:02:01.430  -->  00:02:02.750
Then there is ingestion of events.
50

50

00:02:02.750  -->  00:02:04.170
The first 10,000 events are free,
51

51

00:02:04.170  -->  00:02:06.510
but then you have to pay per finding.
52

52

00:02:06.510  -->  00:02:08.600
Or you get 30 day trial for Security Hub.
53

53

00:02:08.600  -->  00:02:09.433
I'm not going to enable it,
54

54

00:02:09.433  -->  00:02:10.750
but I just want to show you the options.
55

55

00:02:10.750  -->  00:02:11.810
And it really shows you here
56

56

00:02:11.810  -->  00:02:14.520
that we have these Automated security checks
57

57

00:02:14.520  -->  00:02:16.530
and the fact that it looks at different services
58

58

00:02:16.530  -->  00:02:18.610
such as GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie,
59

59

00:02:18.610  -->  00:02:22.270
and others to find these security issues,
60

60

00:02:22.270  -->  00:02:24.020
and then allow you to take actions.
61

61

00:02:24.919  -->  00:02:27.470
So if we go to Security Hub and enable the trial,
62

62

00:02:27.470  -->  00:02:30.230
we'll see that first we need to enable Config
63

63

00:02:30.230  -->  00:02:32.510
to make sure that Security Hub can work.
64

64

00:02:32.510  -->  00:02:34.450
And then we need to choose a Security standards
65

65

00:02:34.450  -->  00:02:35.380
we want to adhere to,
66

66

00:02:35.380  -->  00:02:37.840
so we can have three different options.
67

67

00:02:37.840  -->  00:02:40.011
And finally, the Integrations based on the services
68

68

00:02:40.011  -->  00:02:41.060
that we have enabled,
69

69

00:02:41.060  -->  00:02:42.740
and then you click on enable security hub,
70

70

00:02:42.740  -->  00:02:43.890
and you'll be good to go.
71

71

00:02:43.890  -->  00:02:45.080
But I'm not going to show you anything.
72

72

00:02:45.080  -->  00:02:47.540
I'm not gonna have security issues in my accounts
73

73

00:02:47.540  -->  00:02:48.740
because I don't really use it.
74

74

00:02:48.740  -->  00:02:50.110
But at least I showed you the option
75

75

00:02:50.110  -->  00:02:52.631
and you can see the kind of service that it is.
76

76

00:02:52.631  -->  00:02:53.770
I hope you liked it.
77

77

00:02:53.770  -->  00:02:55.720
And I will see you in the next lecture.
