00:00:00,030  -->  00:00:01,860
<v ->So you need to know the different types</v>
2

2

00:00:01,860  -->  00:00:05,431
of authentication you can have with the AWS Client VPN.
3

3

00:00:05,431  -->  00:00:08,100
So the first one is an active directory
4

4

00:00:08,100  -->  00:00:11,100
authentication where you as a user will authenticate
5

5

00:00:11,100  -->  00:00:12,870
against Microsoft Active Directory.
6

6

00:00:12,870  -->  00:00:14,040
It's user based
7

7

00:00:14,040  -->  00:00:16,110
and then you can use whatever directory you want
8

8

00:00:16,110  -->  00:00:18,870
or you can use a manage directory from AWS
9

9

00:00:18,870  -->  00:00:22,440
such as the AWS Manage Microsoft AD.
10

10

00:00:22,440  -->  00:00:23,993
Or if you wanted to use an on-premises AD
11

11

00:00:23,993  -->  00:00:26,520
then you have to use an AD connector.
12

12

00:00:26,520  -->  00:00:29,550
This supports multifactor authentication.
13

13

00:00:29,550  -->  00:00:32,250
The second way is to use mutual authentication.
14

14

00:00:32,250  -->  00:00:33,900
So this is where you have certificates
15

15

00:00:33,900  -->  00:00:36,240
and the user will use these certificates to
16

16

00:00:36,240  -->  00:00:39,420
perform the authentication to the client VPN service.
17

17

00:00:39,420  -->  00:00:42,330
To do so, you must first upload the service certificates
18

18

00:00:42,330  -->  00:00:43,641
to the certificate manager
19

19

00:00:43,641  -->  00:00:46,170
and you will have one client certificate
20

20

00:00:46,170  -->  00:00:50,040
for each user so that you can properly identify them.
21

21

00:00:50,040  -->  00:00:52,740
The last possibility is to use single sign on.
22

22

00:00:52,740  -->  00:00:55,110
So this supports IAM Identity Center
23

23

00:00:55,110  -->  00:00:58,007
which we use as the new name for AWS SSO.
24

24

00:00:58,007  -->  00:00:59,370
So you will authenticate
25

25

00:00:59,370  -->  00:01:02,130
against the SAML 2.0 based identity provider
26

26

00:01:02,130  -->  00:01:03,493
again based on username, password
27

27

00:01:03,493  -->  00:01:05,806
and then you establish a trust relationship
28

28

00:01:05,806  -->  00:01:08,940
between AWS and this identity provider.
29

29

00:01:08,940  -->  00:01:10,239
For the SSO to work
30

30

00:01:10,239  -->  00:01:12,830
you can only have one identity provider at a time.
31

31

00:01:12,830  -->  00:01:17,220
So in this example, the client is initiating a connection
32

32

00:01:17,220  -->  00:01:18,390
to the client VPN endpoint
33

33

00:01:18,390  -->  00:01:22,282
and we have defined SAML 2.0 idP in IAM
34

34

00:01:22,282  -->  00:01:24,720
such as the client VPN endpoint is going to
35

35

00:01:24,720  -->  00:01:26,872
check the configuration of this idP.
36

36

00:01:26,872  -->  00:01:29,040
Then it's going to return to the client
37

37

00:01:29,040  -->  00:01:30,733
the idP URL to do a login against.
38

38

00:01:30,733  -->  00:01:35,178
The client will do a login using the URL that was provided
39

39

00:01:35,178  -->  00:01:38,460
against the SAML 2.0 identity providers is where
40

40

00:01:38,460  -->  00:01:39,660
you use your username
41

41

00:01:39,660  -->  00:01:42,946
and password to get back a SAML token if you're successful.
42

42

00:01:42,946  -->  00:01:46,131
And then this SAML token is being passed
43

43

00:01:46,131  -->  00:01:48,570
to the client VPN endpoint
44

44

00:01:48,570  -->  00:01:50,610
which is going to validate the SAML token
45

45

00:01:50,610  -->  00:01:53,160
and therefore establish a secure connection
46

46

00:01:53,160  -->  00:01:56,310
between the clients and the client VPN endpoint.
47

47

00:01:56,310  -->  00:01:57,210
Alright, that's it.
48

48

00:01:57,210  -->  00:01:58,860
Just remember these three methods.
49

49

00:01:58,860  -->  00:02:01,810
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
