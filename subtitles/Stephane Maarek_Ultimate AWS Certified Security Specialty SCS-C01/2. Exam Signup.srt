00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,590
<v Instructor>So now is the time to sign up</v>
2

2

00:00:01,590  -->  00:00:03,030
for your certification.
3

3

00:00:03,030  -->  00:00:05,040
And for this you go to this website,
4

4

00:00:05,040  -->  00:00:07,050
aws.training/certification
5

5

00:00:07,050  -->  00:00:08,700
and then you click on sign in.
6

6

00:00:08,700  -->  00:00:09,900
You have to create an account
7

7

00:00:09,900  -->  00:00:11,430
for Amazon or sending user accounts
8

8

00:00:11,430  -->  00:00:13,620
but as you mentioned, it's not for AWS
9

9

00:00:13,620  -->  00:00:15,840
it is an Amazon account, so make sure you have one
10

10

00:00:15,840  -->  00:00:18,540
but you can just create one, it's fairly easy.
11

11

00:00:18,540  -->  00:00:20,940
After you sign in, you're redirected to the screen
12

12

00:00:20,940  -->  00:00:22,620
and then to get your certification
13

13

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:24,900
you click on go to your accounts.
14

14

00:00:24,900  -->  00:00:28,380
Okay, so I am now on the training and certification homepage
15

15

00:00:28,380  -->  00:00:30,960
and I want to register for an exam.
16

16

00:00:30,960  -->  00:00:33,600
So you click here to register for an exam
17

17

00:00:33,600  -->  00:00:35,790
and you'll have access to the exam list
18

18

00:00:35,790  -->  00:00:38,220
as well as a schedule option.
19

19

00:00:38,220  -->  00:00:40,110
Now just so you know, in the next video I go
20

20

00:00:40,110  -->  00:00:42,600
over the benefits tab, so watch the next video as well
21

21

00:00:42,600  -->  00:00:44,160
before you schedule your exam
22

22

00:00:44,160  -->  00:00:46,440
because I show you how to get 50% discount
23

23

00:00:46,440  -->  00:00:47,790
on your next exam.
24

24

00:00:47,790  -->  00:00:48,930
This is a benefit you get
25

25

00:00:48,930  -->  00:00:52,740
once you successfully complete an AWS certification.
26

26

00:00:52,740  -->  00:00:55,830
So back in here into registering your exam.
27

27

00:00:55,830  -->  00:00:59,130
So we can schedule any of these exams.
28

28

00:00:59,130  -->  00:01:01,770
For example, I can select developer associates.
29

29

00:01:01,770  -->  00:01:03,990
I will schedule it with Pearson VUE
30

30

00:01:03,990  -->  00:01:06,900
which is the only option now online.
31

31

00:01:06,900  -->  00:01:08,790
And then I have two options.
32

32

00:01:08,790  -->  00:01:12,840
So we have either the option to select a home office
33

33

00:01:12,840  -->  00:01:15,510
or to select a testing center.
34

34

00:01:15,510  -->  00:01:16,470
So let's have a look.
35

35

00:01:16,470  -->  00:01:19,620
So here we can, for example, take it at a test center
36

36

00:01:19,620  -->  00:01:22,530
in which case you need to bring your photo ID
37

37

00:01:22,530  -->  00:01:24,300
and you have like some expectations
38

38

00:01:24,300  -->  00:01:25,920
regarding your personal items.
39

39

00:01:25,920  -->  00:01:26,940
And then in that case,
40

40

00:01:26,940  -->  00:01:29,700
well you need to select the language you want
41

41

00:01:29,700  -->  00:01:33,000
and then you will find a map with the locations
42

42

00:01:33,000  -->  00:01:35,100
that you may want to select.
43

43

00:01:35,100  -->  00:01:38,850
So here we accept the terms
44

44

00:01:38,850  -->  00:01:41,190
and we can select some testing centers right here
45

45

00:01:41,190  -->  00:01:43,350
for example, here in Portugal.
46

46

00:01:43,350  -->  00:01:44,460
But that's one option.
47

47

00:01:44,460  -->  00:01:46,410
The other option is to do it online.
48

48

00:01:46,410  -->  00:01:50,100
So let's go back to exam registration,
49

49

00:01:50,100  -->  00:01:52,140
and then I'm going to schedule one,
50

50

00:01:52,140  -->  00:01:53,400
this one for example, online.
51

51

00:01:53,400  -->  00:01:55,800
So let's do it.
52

52

00:01:55,800  -->  00:01:58,710
I will do it online at my home or office.
53

53

00:01:58,710  -->  00:02:00,150
And you have a few things to do.
54

54

00:02:00,150  -->  00:02:02,490
So you need to run a system test
55

55

00:02:02,490  -->  00:02:05,010
and I strongly, strongly encourage you to do this
56

56

00:02:05,010  -->  00:02:06,780
to make sure your system is fine
57

57

00:02:06,780  -->  00:02:10,110
because I've been into cases where my computer was not fine,
58

58

00:02:10,110  -->  00:02:12,210
so it's something for you to do for sure.
59

59

00:02:12,210  -->  00:02:15,810
Then there is some guidelines where your testing space.
60

60

00:02:15,810  -->  00:02:17,250
You need your photo ID
61

61

00:02:17,250  -->  00:02:19,650
and it's recommended to arrive 30 minutes early
62

62

00:02:19,650  -->  00:02:22,350
to make sure you are set up just fine.
63

63

00:02:22,350  -->  00:02:24,270
So once we click on online,
64

64

00:02:24,270  -->  00:02:25,710
we can choose a language we want,
65

65

00:02:25,710  -->  00:02:27,543
so English for me is fine.
66

66

00:02:28,380  -->  00:02:33,380
We take all the conditions to accept the terms of service
67

67

00:02:34,650  -->  00:02:37,170
and then click on agree.
68

68

00:02:37,170  -->  00:02:38,370
Then we select the language again,
69

69

00:02:38,370  -->  00:02:39,783
so English for the proctor,
70

70

00:02:41,190  -->  00:02:42,780
your time zone if you wanted to.
71

71

00:02:42,780  -->  00:02:45,840
Finally you can find a date
72

72

00:02:45,840  -->  00:02:49,020
and a time, so I can choose for example
73

73

00:02:49,020  -->  00:02:54,020
tomorrow at this time, perfect, book this appointment.
74

74

00:02:55,980  -->  00:02:58,590
And next I'm ready to just pay for my exam
75

75

00:02:58,590  -->  00:03:00,510
and proceed to checkout.
76

76

00:03:00,510  -->  00:03:02,310
Also, before you book your exam
77

77

00:03:02,310  -->  00:03:04,500
please, if you are a non-English speaker,
78

78

00:03:04,500  -->  00:03:06,840
you can request an exam accommodation that I show you
79

79

00:03:06,840  -->  00:03:08,250
in the next lectures
80

80

00:03:08,250  -->  00:03:11,250
on how to get 30 minutes extra for your exam.
81

81

00:03:11,250  -->  00:03:14,940
Finally, once your exam is actually scheduled,
82

82

00:03:14,940  -->  00:03:16,530
the day of the exam itself,
83

83

00:03:16,530  -->  00:03:19,440
you click on manage Pearson VUE exam
84

84

00:03:19,440  -->  00:03:20,910
and this is actually going to take you
85

85

00:03:20,910  -->  00:03:22,950
into the Pearson VUE system,
86

86

00:03:22,950  -->  00:03:25,440
and from there you will be able, in here,
87

87

00:03:25,440  -->  00:03:26,970
to see the scheduled exam.
88

88

00:03:26,970  -->  00:03:30,210
You can click on it and access your exam from there.
89

89

00:03:30,210  -->  00:03:31,650
Alright, that's it.
90

90

00:03:31,650  -->  00:03:33,660
I wish you the best of luck for your exam
91

91

00:03:33,660  -->  00:03:35,610
and I will see you in the next lecture.
