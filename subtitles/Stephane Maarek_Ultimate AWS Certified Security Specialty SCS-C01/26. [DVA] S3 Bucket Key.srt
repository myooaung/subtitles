00:00:00,770  -->  00:00:03,300
<v ->So now let's talk about a cool new settings</v>
2

2

00:00:03,300  -->  00:00:07,430
for your S3 Buckets using it with SSE-KMS encryption.
3

3

00:00:07,430  -->  00:00:08,440
And this is a new setting
4

4

00:00:08,440  -->  00:00:11,070
which will allow you to decrease and wait for it.
5

5

00:00:11,070  -->  00:00:15,070
The number of API calls made to KMS from Amazon S3
6

6

00:00:15,070  -->  00:00:20,070
when you use the SSE-KMS type of encryption by 99%.
7

7

00:00:20,140  -->  00:00:24,240
Which will reduce the cost of your overall KMS encryption
8

8

00:00:24,240  -->  00:00:27,750
used by Amazon S3 by also 99%.
9

9

00:00:27,750  -->  00:00:28,930
And how does this work?
10

10

00:00:28,930  -->  00:00:30,840
Well, this leverages data key
11

11

00:00:30,840  -->  00:00:32,160
and more importantly,
12

12

00:00:32,160  -->  00:00:35,390
this thing called an S3 bucket key.
13

13

00:00:35,390  -->  00:00:36,600
So how does that work?
14

14

00:00:36,600  -->  00:00:39,470
Well, a customer master key and KMS
15

15

00:00:39,470  -->  00:00:41,480
is going to be used to generate
16

16

00:00:41,480  -->  00:00:44,400
a data key for your Amazon S3 Bucket once in a while
17

17

00:00:44,400  -->  00:00:45,580
and this key will rotates.
18

18

00:00:45,580  -->  00:00:47,570
But, once in a while and this key's called
19

19

00:00:47,570  -->  00:00:49,920
an Amazon S3 Bucket key.
20

20

00:00:49,920  -->  00:00:54,460
And this key is what's going to be used to encrypt objects
21

21

00:00:54,460  -->  00:00:57,720
in your Amazon S3 Buckets with KMS encryption.
22

22

00:00:57,720  -->  00:01:00,840
So this extra bucket key is going to generate
23

23

00:01:00,840  -->  00:01:04,050
a lot of data keys using envelope encryption
24

24

00:01:04,050  -->  00:01:08,140
which is going to go into encrypting your S3 Buckets.
25

25

00:01:08,140  -->  00:01:10,350
But by adding an S3 Bucket key
26

26

00:01:10,350  -->  00:01:12,010
and not using KMS directly
27

27

00:01:12,010  -->  00:01:13,800
to generate these data keys,
28

28

00:01:13,800  -->  00:01:15,370
we are reducing the number
29

29

00:01:15,370  -->  00:01:17,660
of API calls we are making into KMS.
30

30

00:01:17,660  -->  00:01:21,830
And therefore, we are reducing our costs by a lot.
31

31

00:01:21,830  -->  00:01:23,580
And so this is an optimization
32

32

00:01:23,580  -->  00:01:26,320
of using SSE-KMS to decrease the number
33

33

00:01:26,320  -->  00:01:28,520
of KMS API calls in order,
34

34

00:01:28,520  -->  00:01:30,520
for example, not to have a high bill
35

35

00:01:30,520  -->  00:01:32,830
or not to go over the limits of encryption
36

36

00:01:32,830  -->  00:01:34,630
within your Amazon S3 Buckets
37

37

00:01:34,630  -->  00:01:37,360
but without compromising on security.
38

38

00:01:37,360  -->  00:01:39,280
The result of that is that you will see
39

39

00:01:39,280  -->  00:01:43,470
less CloudTrail events regarding KMS in CloudTrail.
40

40

00:01:43,470  -->  00:01:45,390
And also, you will have
41

41

00:01:45,390  -->  00:01:48,410
a way way lower costs as I said in KMS.
42

42

00:01:48,410  -->  00:01:49,990
So that's it for this lecture.
43

43

00:01:49,990  -->  00:01:51,680
A very good setting to know,
44

44

00:01:51,680  -->  00:01:54,350
especially if you use SSE-KMS at Scale
45

45

00:01:54,350  -->  00:01:55,770
were very high for both.
46

46

00:01:55,770  -->  00:01:57,290
Now let me show you where you can find
47

47

00:01:57,290  -->  00:02:00,360
that setting in the S3 Console.
48

48

00:02:00,360  -->  00:02:02,110
So let's go into the S3 Console
49

49

00:02:03,330  -->  00:02:05,520
and I'm going to create a new buckets.
50

50

00:02:05,520  -->  00:02:07,550
So I'm going to create a buckets
51

51

00:02:07,550  -->  00:02:08,736
and I'll call it,
52

52

00:02:08,736  -->  00:02:13,410
(keyboard typing)
Demo S3 Buckets key.
53

53

00:02:13,410  -->  00:02:14,350
Okay?
54

54

00:02:14,350  -->  00:02:15,790
Then we'll block, public settings.
55

55

00:02:15,790  -->  00:02:17,540
We'll disable, versioning.
56

56

00:02:17,540  -->  00:02:19,680
We'll enable, encryption.
57

57

00:02:19,680  -->  00:02:22,490
And it's going to be SSE-KMS,
58

58

00:02:22,490  -->  00:02:24,273
and it's going to be managed key.
59

59

00:02:24,273  -->  00:02:25,106
(mouse clicking)
60

60

00:02:25,106  -->  00:02:26,700
And we are going to enable, bucket keys.
61

61

00:02:26,700  -->  00:02:28,070
So by default, it is enabled now,
62

62

00:02:28,070  -->  00:02:28,903
but we could disable it
63

63

00:02:28,903  -->  00:02:32,020
if we wanted to get every single upload to talk to KMS.
64

64

00:02:32,020  -->  00:02:33,050
But, if you want to enable it
65

65

00:02:33,050  -->  00:02:34,540
we'll just click on enable.
66

66

00:02:34,540  -->  00:02:37,550
And this will use the bucket key to decrease the cost
67

67

00:02:37,550  -->  00:02:39,570
and the number of calls made to KMS
68

68

00:02:39,570  -->  00:02:41,870
without losing any security.
69

69

00:02:41,870  -->  00:02:42,870
So fairly easy,
70

70

00:02:42,870  -->  00:02:44,520
then we create the buckets
71

71

00:02:44,520  -->  00:02:45,710
and we're good to go.
72

72

00:02:45,710  -->  00:02:48,190
And we're now using the bucket key
73

73

00:02:48,190  -->  00:02:51,020
for encryption into our S3 Buckets.
74

74

00:02:51,020  -->  00:02:53,393
So that's it, I will see you in the next lecture.
