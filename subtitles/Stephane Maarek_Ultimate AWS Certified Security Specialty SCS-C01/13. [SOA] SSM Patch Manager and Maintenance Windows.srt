00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:01,730
<v Instructor>So now let's see an overview</v>
2

2

00:00:01,730  -->  00:00:03,720
of the SSM Patch Manager.
3

3

00:00:03,720  -->  00:00:06,130
So we use the Patch Manager to automate the process
4

4

00:00:06,130  -->  00:00:08,260
of patching our managed instances.
5

5

00:00:08,260  -->  00:00:10,810
This includes OS updates, applications updates,
6

6

00:00:10,810  -->  00:00:12,200
and security updates.
7

7

00:00:12,200  -->  00:00:14,410
Of course, it supports both EC2 instances
8

8

00:00:14,410  -->  00:00:15,810
and on-premises server
9

9

00:00:15,810  -->  00:00:18,150
and Linux, macOS, and Windows.
10

10

00:00:18,150  -->  00:00:19,740
You're going to patch on-demand
11

11

00:00:19,740  -->  00:00:22,150
so you can run the Patch Manager as you want
12

12

00:00:22,150  -->  00:00:25,800
or on the schedule if you want to use a Maintenance Window.
13

13

00:00:25,800  -->  00:00:27,270
What's going to happen is that the Patch Manager
14

14

00:00:27,270  -->  00:00:28,810
will scan the instances
15

15

00:00:28,810  -->  00:00:30,810
and will generate a patch compliance report,
16

16

00:00:30,810  -->  00:00:33,170
which is a list of all the missing patches,
17

17

00:00:33,170  -->  00:00:35,670
and then this report can be sent to S3.
18

18

00:00:35,670  -->  00:00:37,740
And then we can act upon this report.
19

19

00:00:37,740  -->  00:00:40,920
So Patch Manager has two components we need to know about,
20

20

00:00:40,920  -->  00:00:42,990
which is the number one is the Patch Baseline,
21

21

00:00:42,990  -->  00:00:45,100
and the number two is Patch Groups.
22

22

00:00:45,100  -->  00:00:46,620
So Patch Baseline defines
23

23

00:00:46,620  -->  00:00:49,160
which patches should and shouldn't be installed
24

24

00:00:49,160  -->  00:00:52,560
on your EC2 instances and the ability
25

25

00:00:52,560  -->  00:00:55,040
to create custom Patch Baseline is up to you
26

26

00:00:55,040  -->  00:00:58,370
if you want to specify approved or rejected patches
27

27

00:00:58,370  -->  00:00:59,450
on your instance.
28

28

00:00:59,450  -->  00:01:01,240
The patches can also be auto-approved
29

29

00:01:01,240  -->  00:01:02,630
within days of their release
30

30

00:01:02,630  -->  00:01:04,970
in case someone is not there to approve them.
31

31

00:01:04,970  -->  00:01:05,940
By default,
32

32

00:01:05,940  -->  00:01:08,720
the patch baseline is to install only critical patches
33

33

00:01:08,720  -->  00:01:10,610
and patches related to security
34

34

00:01:10,610  -->  00:01:13,400
onto your SSM managed instances.
35

35

00:01:13,400  -->  00:01:14,470
Now for Patch Group,
36

36

00:01:14,470  -->  00:01:17,130
this is to associate a set of instances
37

37

00:01:17,130  -->  00:01:18,580
with a specific Patch Baseline.
38

38

00:01:18,580  -->  00:01:20,660
So if you define custom patch baselines,
39

39

00:01:20,660  -->  00:01:23,530
then you can create Patch Groups to associate them together.
40

40

00:01:23,530  -->  00:01:24,440
And for example,
41

41

00:01:24,440  -->  00:01:27,530
you can have a Patch Group for dev, test, and prod.
42

42

00:01:27,530  -->  00:01:29,220
Now instances when using patch groups
43

43

00:01:29,220  -->  00:01:32,040
should be defined with the tag key Patch Group
44

44

00:01:32,040  -->  00:01:35,100
and an instance at any time therefore can only be part
45

45

00:01:35,100  -->  00:01:37,360
of one Patch Group.
46

46

00:01:37,360  -->  00:01:39,310
And the Patch Group can only be registered
47

47

00:01:39,310  -->  00:01:41,060
with one Patch Baseline.
48

48

00:01:41,060  -->  00:01:42,240
So hopefully that makes sense,
49

49

00:01:42,240  -->  00:01:43,780
but I made this diagram for you.
50

50

00:01:43,780  -->  00:01:47,330
So we have three types of EC2 instances, okay,
51

51

00:01:47,330  -->  00:01:48,920
all running the SSM agents.
52

52

00:01:48,920  -->  00:01:50,520
The number ones are going to be tagged
53

53

00:01:50,520  -->  00:01:52,480
with OS, Windows; Patch Group, Dev.
54

54

00:01:52,480  -->  00:01:53,810
Number two is OS, Windows.
55

55

00:01:53,810  -->  00:01:56,810
Number three is OS, Windows; Patch Group, Prod, okay.
56

56

00:01:56,810  -->  00:02:00,780
And in Patch Manager, we're going to define Patch Baselines.
57

57

00:02:00,780  -->  00:02:02,540
So the first Patch Baseline is attached
58

58

00:02:02,540  -->  00:02:03,610
to the default Patch Group,
59

59

00:02:03,610  -->  00:02:07,020
which is when a Patch Group is not defined by default, okay.
60

60

00:02:07,020  -->  00:02:08,090
And this is default yes,
61

61

00:02:08,090  -->  00:02:09,270
so any instance
62

62

00:02:09,270  -->  00:02:11,620
that doesn't have a specific Patch Group is going
63

63

00:02:11,620  -->  00:02:14,400
to get the first Patch Baseline ID.
64

64

00:02:14,400  -->  00:02:17,810
And the second one is running the Patch Group Dev,
65

65

00:02:17,810  -->  00:02:20,160
which is not a default Patch Baseline,
66

66

00:02:20,160  -->  00:02:22,640
and we have a specific Patch Baseline ID.
67

67

00:02:22,640  -->  00:02:24,840
So thanks to this tagging, the first instance,
68

68

00:02:24,840  -->  00:02:27,000
which is under Patch Group Dev is going
69

69

00:02:27,000  -->  00:02:30,860
to have the PB nine, eight, whatever Patch Baseline ID.
70

70

00:02:30,860  -->  00:02:31,930
And the other two are going
71

71

00:02:31,930  -->  00:02:35,280
to have the PB zero, one, two, three Patch Baseline ID
72

72

00:02:35,280  -->  00:02:37,803
because they are not patched,
73

73

00:02:37,803  -->  00:02:40,660
tagged with the Patch Group Dev, okay.
74

74

00:02:40,660  -->  00:02:43,210
So here we are going to run a command
75

75

00:02:43,210  -->  00:02:44,540
and this command is going to be
76

76

00:02:44,540  -->  00:02:49,540
running a documents called AWS-RunPatchBaseline, okay.
77

77

00:02:49,770  -->  00:02:52,090
And this can be initiated from the console,
78

78

00:02:52,090  -->  00:02:54,560
the SDK or the Maintenance Window.
79

79

00:02:54,560  -->  00:02:57,470
And then the run command itself will be applied
80

80

00:02:57,470  -->  00:02:59,640
to all these EC2 instances
81

81

00:02:59,640  -->  00:03:03,120
from within, obviously, to install the patches.
82

82

00:03:03,120  -->  00:03:06,700
Now the SSN agents on these instances will query
83

83

00:03:06,700  -->  00:03:09,300
to the Patch Manager service to get an idea
84

84

00:03:09,300  -->  00:03:11,760
of which patches to include and to run
85

85

00:03:11,760  -->  00:03:13,200
thanks to the Patch Baseline.
86

86

00:03:13,200  -->  00:03:14,420
So this may seem complicated,
87

87

00:03:14,420  -->  00:03:16,130
but hopefully it's something you understand.
88

88

00:03:16,130  -->  00:03:18,030
And then obviously you can have rate control
89

89

00:03:18,030  -->  00:03:22,020
just like anything in SSM using a Maintenance Window.
90

90

00:03:22,020  -->  00:03:23,450
So talking about Maintenance Windows,
91

91

00:03:23,450  -->  00:03:24,980
this is when you want to define a schedule
92

92

00:03:24,980  -->  00:03:27,010
for when to perform actions on your instances.
93

93

00:03:27,010  -->  00:03:29,540
For example, OS patching, updating drivers
94

94

00:03:29,540  -->  00:03:30,440
and installing software.
95

95

00:03:30,440  -->  00:03:31,670
For example, this could be done
96

96

00:03:31,670  -->  00:03:34,440
at night between 3:00 and 5:00 AM
97

97

00:03:34,440  -->  00:03:36,650
and a Maintenance Window contains a schedule,
98

98

00:03:36,650  -->  00:03:39,200
a duration and a set of registered instances,
99

99

00:03:39,200  -->  00:03:41,120
as well as a set of tasks
100

100

00:03:41,120  -->  00:03:43,910
that can be run during that Maintenance Window.
101

101

00:03:43,910  -->  00:03:44,850
So hopefully that makes sense.
102

102

00:03:44,850  -->  00:03:46,880
From an exam perspective,
103

103

00:03:46,880  -->  00:03:49,410
what you need to know is that Patch Manager is used
104

104

00:03:49,410  -->  00:03:50,600
to patch your instances,
105

105

00:03:50,600  -->  00:03:52,510
but that comes, I guess, naturally.
106

106

00:03:52,510  -->  00:03:54,210
And these patches can be run
107

107

00:03:54,210  -->  00:03:56,220
within a specific maintenance window
108

108

00:03:56,220  -->  00:03:58,570
with a specific rate control if you need to.
109

109

00:03:58,570  -->  00:03:59,403
Okay, that's it.
110

110

00:03:59,403  -->  00:04:00,910
I will see you in the next lecture.
