00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:01,170
<v Stephane>So this lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01,170  -->  00:00:03,420
is going to be a little bit complicated,
3

3

00:00:03,420  -->  00:00:05,100
can be quite heavy.
4

4

00:00:05,100  -->  00:00:07,050
It almost seems very complicated.
5

5

00:00:07,050  -->  00:00:08,430
You don't have to remember everything.
6

6

00:00:08,430  -->  00:00:10,980
You just need to remember the main idea behind it.
7

7

00:00:10,980  -->  00:00:11,880
Just a little disclaimer
8

8

00:00:11,880  -->  00:00:14,610
because this next diagram can be a little intense.
9

9

00:00:14,610  -->  00:00:18,240
But I want to show you the KMS Key Authorization Process,
10

10

00:00:18,240  -->  00:00:22,680
how is a KMS Key usage evaluated for yes or no.
11

11

00:00:22,680  -->  00:00:23,910
So get ready.
12

12

00:00:23,910  -->  00:00:26,790
First, the theory, then a few examples.
13

13

00:00:26,790  -->  00:00:28,380
So we start and we look at
14

14

00:00:28,380  -->  00:00:30,000
whether or not there's a DENY statement
15

15

00:00:30,000  -->  00:00:32,160
in the KMS Key Policy or anywhere.
16

16

00:00:32,160  -->  00:00:35,430
If there is, this is the same as anywhere in AWS,
17

17

00:00:35,430  -->  00:00:37,650
the request is just going to be denied.
18

18

00:00:37,650  -->  00:00:40,260
If no, then we look at whether or not
19

19

00:00:40,260  -->  00:00:43,590
the SCP of your organization ALLOW the access.
20

20

00:00:43,590  -->  00:00:45,150
Again, if it doesn't, DENY.
21

21

00:00:45,150  -->  00:00:48,000
Or if it doesn't exist, it's going to be ignored.
22

22

00:00:48,000  -->  00:00:50,400
Then is there a VPC Endpoint Policy
23

23

00:00:50,400  -->  00:00:51,840
that allows access to KMS?
24

24

00:00:51,840  -->  00:00:54,480
So if you're accessing the KMS service privately.
25

25

00:00:54,480  -->  00:00:56,100
Again, no, DENY.
26

26

00:00:56,100  -->  00:00:56,933
Yes, move on.
27

27

00:00:56,933  -->  00:00:58,500
And, of course, if it doesn't exist,
28

28

00:00:58,500  -->  00:01:00,600
you just pass that step.
29

29

00:01:00,600  -->  00:01:02,670
Next, we are go into the KMS specific stuff.
30

30

00:01:02,670  -->  00:01:04,890
So is the Key Policy
31

31

00:01:04,890  -->  00:01:08,160
allowing the caller to perform the action?
32

32

00:01:08,160  -->  00:01:10,560
No, then we look at a Grant.
33

33

00:01:10,560  -->  00:01:12,750
So remember, we have the Key Policy.
34

34

00:01:12,750  -->  00:01:14,790
But even if the Key Policy doesn't contain things,
35

35

00:01:14,790  -->  00:01:18,780
a Grant may still allow the caller to perform the action.
36

36

00:01:18,780  -->  00:01:22,710
And then we look at the Key Policy.
37

37

00:01:22,710  -->  00:01:24,450
And then we look at whether or not,
38

38

00:01:24,450  -->  00:01:26,820
so before it was authorizing the caller itself,
39

39

00:01:26,820  -->  00:01:29,340
so the user or the AIM role directly.
40

40

00:01:29,340  -->  00:01:30,930
But then we look at the Key Policy
41

41

00:01:30,930  -->  00:01:33,360
and we say, "Well, do we allow the accounts
42

42

00:01:33,360  -->  00:01:35,790
to use IAM policies to control Key access?"
43

43

00:01:35,790  -->  00:01:40,140
which is the default KMS Key Policy that we saw before.
44

44

00:01:40,140  -->  00:01:43,890
So here, we would delegate access to IAM.
45

45

00:01:43,890  -->  00:01:44,723
If it doesn't exist,
46

46

00:01:44,723  -->  00:01:46,680
we look at whether there's a Grant
47

47

00:01:46,680  -->  00:01:49,410
that allows the caller's accounts to use IAM policies
48

48

00:01:49,410  -->  00:01:51,180
to control Key access.
49

49

00:01:51,180  -->  00:01:52,830
And if it doesn't exist, no.
50

50

00:01:52,830  -->  00:01:56,730
But if we do have the default KMS Policy, for example,
51

51

00:01:56,730  -->  00:01:58,050
then we look at IAM.
52

52

00:01:58,050  -->  00:02:01,170
And is IAM allowing the action, yes or no?
53

53

00:02:01,170  -->  00:02:03,600
Then, of course, if we have a Grant allowing this,
54

54

00:02:03,600  -->  00:02:05,490
again we look at IAM.
55

55

00:02:05,490  -->  00:02:07,080
Then we look at whether or not
56

56

00:02:07,080  -->  00:02:09,330
the Key is in the same account as the caller.
57

57

00:02:09,330  -->  00:02:11,550
So because we have cross account concerns.
58

58

00:02:11,550  -->  00:02:14,280
If it is in the same accounts, we're good to go.
59

59

00:02:14,280  -->  00:02:18,420
And again, we can draw this yes lines
60

60

00:02:18,420  -->  00:02:20,190
from the two from before.
61

61

00:02:20,190  -->  00:02:24,180
But if the Key is not in the same accounts as the caller,
62

62

00:02:24,180  -->  00:02:27,390
then we look at whether or not there was a Grant
63

63

00:02:27,390  -->  00:02:29,070
created by the caller's accounts
64

64

00:02:29,070  -->  00:02:32,040
to allow the caller's action to perform the action.
65

65

00:02:32,040  -->  00:02:32,970
If yes, we're good.
66

66

00:02:32,970  -->  00:02:36,210
If not, we look at the IAM Policy in the cross accounts,
67

67

00:02:36,210  -->  00:02:38,130
and then we are good.
68

68

00:02:38,130  -->  00:02:41,130
So this is a complicated schema, but hopefully,
69

69

00:02:41,130  -->  00:02:43,320
because I've covered all the concepts of these before,
70

70

00:02:43,320  -->  00:02:46,080
you should feel somewhat familiar with it.
71

71

00:02:46,080  -->  00:02:48,030
But I wouldn't blame you if you don't remember this.
72

72

00:02:48,030  -->  00:02:52,200
Again, just remember the concepts of Grants, Key Policies,
73

73

00:02:52,200  -->  00:02:55,530
Default Key Policies that would delegate actions to IAM.
74

74

00:02:55,530  -->  00:02:56,970
And for cross account access,
75

75

00:02:56,970  -->  00:02:59,250
I'll have a simplified slide in the next lecture,
76

76

00:02:59,250  -->  00:03:01,140
so don't worry too much.
77

77

00:03:01,140  -->  00:03:05,460
So, okay, just remember Key, Key Grants, IAM Policies,
78

78

00:03:05,460  -->  00:03:08,430
SCPs, and VPC Endpoint Policies are included.
79

79

00:03:08,430  -->  00:03:10,140
So let's take this example.
80

80

00:03:10,140  -->  00:03:12,600
We have the default KMS Key Policy
81

81

00:03:12,600  -->  00:03:14,130
to grant access to an accounts.
82

82

00:03:14,130  -->  00:03:17,790
And Alice makes API calls within the same accounts.
83

83

00:03:17,790  -->  00:03:21,390
So here, we have all this path that could be relevant
84

84

00:03:21,390  -->  00:03:24,030
and so we go one by one for all the steps.
85

85

00:03:24,030  -->  00:03:26,250
Those the same boxes have just been reordered.
86

86

00:03:26,250  -->  00:03:28,477
First is you categorize it for the use authorization
87

87

00:03:28,477  -->  00:03:30,270
and then the Key trust.
88

88

00:03:30,270  -->  00:03:31,590
So is there a denying statement?
89

89

00:03:31,590  -->  00:03:32,423
No.
90

90

00:03:32,423  -->  00:03:33,690
Then is the Key Policy
91

91

00:03:33,690  -->  00:03:36,210
allowing the action for the caller?
92

92

00:03:36,210  -->  00:03:38,730
No, because we use the default KMS Key Policy.
93

93

00:03:38,730  -->  00:03:40,800
So there's no Key Policy, there's no Grant.
94

94

00:03:40,800  -->  00:03:44,520
Then we use the Key Policy and it's the Default Key Policy.
95

95

00:03:44,520  -->  00:03:47,220
Therefore, yes, this one is a box for yes.
96

96

00:03:47,220  -->  00:03:49,200
Then we look at the IAM Policy
97

97

00:03:49,200  -->  00:03:52,470
and is Alice having the proper IAM permissions?
98

98

00:03:52,470  -->  00:03:53,970
Well, yes or no?
99

99

00:03:53,970  -->  00:03:57,600
If it doesn't have it, then it's gonna be denied.
100

100

00:03:57,600  -->  00:04:00,780
But if it has it, then you go into the Key trust,
101

101

00:04:00,780  -->  00:04:02,880
it's in the same account, and it would be allowed.
102

102

00:04:02,880  -->  00:04:04,650
So hopefully this path makes sense.
103

103

00:04:04,650  -->  00:04:07,920
It's the most common one you see when you use AWS.
104

104

00:04:07,920  -->  00:04:09,600
So let's take a look at another example.
105

105

00:04:09,600  -->  00:04:12,210
This time is for cross account access.
106

106

00:04:12,210  -->  00:04:14,130
So let's look at the Key Authorization Process.
107

107

00:04:14,130  -->  00:04:16,890
So we have a KMS Key Policy in Account 2
108

108

00:04:16,890  -->  00:04:19,890
that allows for all the Principals in Accounts 1.
109

109

00:04:19,890  -->  00:04:21,660
And then because it's cross accounts,
110

110

00:04:21,660  -->  00:04:24,030
we must make sure we have also an IAM Policy
111

111

00:04:24,030  -->  00:04:25,440
in Account 1 authorizing things.
112

112

00:04:25,440  -->  00:04:27,660
So let's go through this diagram again.
113

113

00:04:27,660  -->  00:04:28,830
Is there a DENY statement?
114

114

00:04:28,830  -->  00:04:29,663
No.
115

115

00:04:29,663  -->  00:04:32,280
Is the Key Policy allowing the caller to perform the action?
116

116

00:04:32,280  -->  00:04:34,800
No, because we authorize an entire accounts.
117

117

00:04:34,800  -->  00:04:36,750
So no Key Policy, no Grants.
118

118

00:04:36,750  -->  00:04:38,130
Then we have this.
119

119

00:04:38,130  -->  00:04:40,590
Does the Key Policy allow the caller's accounts
120

120

00:04:40,590  -->  00:04:42,390
to use IAM policy to control Key access?
121

121

00:04:42,390  -->  00:04:44,730
Yes. So we are going in here.
122

122

00:04:44,730  -->  00:04:46,890
And then does the IAM Policy ALLOW
123

123

00:04:46,890  -->  00:04:48,210
the caller to perform the action?
124

124

00:04:48,210  -->  00:04:49,770
The answer is yes.
125

125

00:04:49,770  -->  00:04:52,050
Is the same Key in the same account as well as the caller?
126

126

00:04:52,050  -->  00:04:53,910
No, because we're doing cross accounts.
127

127

00:04:53,910  -->  00:04:54,743
Is there a Grant?
128

128

00:04:54,743  -->  00:04:55,890
No, there is no Grants.
129

129

00:04:55,890  -->  00:04:57,840
So then we look at the IAM Policy
130

130

00:04:57,840  -->  00:04:59,700
of the caller to perform the action.
131

131

00:04:59,700  -->  00:05:03,120
And if the caller has the proper policy in this account,
132

132

00:05:03,120  -->  00:05:06,030
then, yes, we're good to go and we have an ALLOW.
133

133

00:05:06,030  -->  00:05:07,350
So that's it for this lecture.
134

134

00:05:07,350  -->  00:05:09,270
Hopefully that makes sense.
135

135

00:05:09,270  -->  00:05:10,140
I hope you liked it.
136

136

00:05:10,140  -->  00:05:12,183
And I will see you in the next lecture.
