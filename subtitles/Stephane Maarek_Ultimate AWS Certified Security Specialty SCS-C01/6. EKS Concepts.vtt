00:00:00.300  -->  00:00:02.430
<v Instructor>So Amazon EKS is to manage</v>
2

2

00:00:02.430  -->  00:00:05.190
Kubernetes clusters on AWS
3

3

00:00:05.190  -->  00:00:08.340
and you can log stuff that's happening within your cluster.
4

4

00:00:08.340  -->  00:00:09.900
So you can log what's happening with your pods,
5

5

00:00:09.900  -->  00:00:11.520
your pods are your containers,
6

6

00:00:11.520  -->  00:00:12.900
or you can log what's happening with your nodes,
7

7

00:00:12.900  -->  00:00:15.810
and your nodes is the underlying infrastructure
8

8

00:00:15.810  -->  00:00:18.360
of your EKS, your Kubernetes cluster.
9

9

00:00:18.360  -->  00:00:19.740
So to give you an idea,
10

10

00:00:19.740  -->  00:00:21.960
any event that happens within Amazon EKS
11

11

00:00:21.960  -->  00:00:24.270
will have a TTL of 60 minutes.
12

12

00:00:24.270  -->  00:00:26.040
It cannot be changed, and then it will be lost.
13

13

00:00:26.040  -->  00:00:28.830
So to keep history beyond these 60 minutes,
14

14

00:00:28.830  -->  00:00:31.680
you must send all these events into CloudWatch Logs,
15

15

00:00:31.680  -->  00:00:32.820
and that is possible.
16

16

00:00:32.820  -->  00:00:35.970
So anything such as the EKS control plane logs
17

17

00:00:35.970  -->  00:00:37.350
can be sent to CloudWatch Logs,
18

18

00:00:37.350  -->  00:00:39.780
as well as any events within your pods
19

19

00:00:39.780  -->  00:00:41.820
can be sent to CloudWatch Logs as well.
20

20

00:00:41.820  -->  00:00:43.770
So for the control plane logging,
21

21

00:00:43.770  -->  00:00:45.330
you're going to get your audit logs,
22

22

00:00:45.330  -->  00:00:46.980
you're going to get your diagnostic logs,
23

23

00:00:46.980  -->  00:00:48.840
you're going to get your controller logs,
24

24

00:00:48.840  -->  00:00:50.064
and you can define which log types
25

25

00:00:50.064  -->  00:00:53.160
you want to send to CloudWatch Logs as well.
26

26

00:00:53.160  -->  00:00:55.830
So that's it, just this little bit of information.
27

27

00:00:55.830  -->  00:00:57.000
I hope you liked it.
28

28

00:00:57.000  -->  00:00:59.013
And I will see you in the next lecture.
