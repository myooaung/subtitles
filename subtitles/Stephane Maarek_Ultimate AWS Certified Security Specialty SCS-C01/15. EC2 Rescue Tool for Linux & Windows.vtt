00:00:00.072  -->  00:00:01.380
<v Instructor>So let's do a deep dive</v>
2

2

00:00:01.380  -->  00:00:03.060
into the EC2Rescue tool.
3

3

00:00:03.060  -->  00:00:03.960
We have two flavors.
4

4

00:00:03.960  -->  00:00:06.780
We have the one for Linux and the one for Windows.
5

5

00:00:06.780  -->  00:00:08.040
So this allows you to diagnose
6

6

00:00:08.040  -->  00:00:11.070
and troubleshoot common issues with your EC2 instances.
7

7

00:00:11.070  -->  00:00:12.900
It can gather syslog logs.
8

8

00:00:12.900  -->  00:00:15.300
It can diagnose problematic kernel parameters.
9

9

00:00:15.300  -->  00:00:18.420
It can diagnose common OpenSSH issues and so on.
10

10

00:00:18.420  -->  00:00:20.610
You are, you have over 100 modules,
11

11

00:00:20.610  -->  00:00:21.840
so quite a lot.
12

12

00:00:21.840  -->  00:00:23.640
This works with Amazon Linux 2,
13

13

00:00:23.640  -->  00:00:25.650
Ubuntu, Red Hats,
14

14

00:00:25.650  -->  00:00:26.610
and other kind
15

15

00:00:26.610  -->  00:00:28.170
of Linux distribution.
16

16

00:00:28.170  -->  00:00:29.700
For this, you can install it manually,
17

17

00:00:29.700  -->  00:00:32.670
or you can run an SSM automation document,
18

18

00:00:32.670  -->  00:00:33.503
to just go ahead
19

19

00:00:33.503  -->  00:00:35.850
and install the EC2Rescue tool.
20

20

00:00:35.850  -->  00:00:37.050
And if you run, for example,
21

21

00:00:37.050  -->  00:00:39.360
the TroubleshootSSL automation out of it,
22

22

00:00:39.360  -->  00:00:41.730
then it's going to try to fix SSH issues,
23

23

00:00:41.730  -->  00:00:43.620
going into the instance.
24

24

00:00:43.620  -->  00:00:46.560
Now, the EC2Rescue tool, when it does output things,
25

25

00:00:46.560  -->  00:00:49.830
it can send directly data into the supports engine.
26

26

00:00:49.830  -->  00:00:52.061
So this gives data to the support of
27

27

00:00:52.061  -->  00:00:54.090
AWS, if you ever need that.
28

28

00:00:54.090  -->  00:00:57.990
Or you can upload the results directly into an S3 buckets.
29

29

00:00:57.990  -->  00:00:59.280
So what could be use cases
30

30

00:00:59.280  -->  00:01:01.470
for the EC2Rescue tool for Linux?
31

31

00:01:01.470  -->  00:01:02.303
Well, number one,
32

32

00:01:02.303  -->  00:01:05.220
is to collect system utilization reports such as,
33

33

00:01:05.220  -->  00:01:07.233
vmstate, iostat, mpstats.
34

34

00:01:07.233  -->  00:01:09.570
You can collect logs and details,
35

35

00:01:09.570  -->  00:01:11.910
such as syslog, dmesg,
36

36

00:01:11.910  -->  00:01:14.910
application error logs, and SSM logs.
37

37

00:01:14.910  -->  00:01:17.100
You can detect system problems such as,
38

38

00:01:17.100  -->  00:01:20.850
asymmetric routing or duplicate root device labels.
39

39

00:01:20.850  -->  00:01:23.400
You can remediate system problems such as,
40

40

00:01:23.400  -->  00:01:25.450
OpenSSH file permissions or
41

41

00:01:25.450  -->  00:01:28.770
disabling non-problematic kernel problems.
42

42

00:01:28.770  -->  00:01:29.730
And on top of it,
43

43

00:01:29.730  -->  00:01:32.103
you could create your own custom module.
44

44

00:01:32.940  -->  00:01:35.490
So the flavor for Windows server is good as well.
45

45

00:01:35.490  -->  00:01:38.280
So you diagnose and troubleshoot common issues.
46

46

00:01:38.280  -->  00:01:39.270
So all these things before,
47

47

00:01:39.270  -->  00:01:40.530
you can collect log files,
48

48

00:01:40.530  -->  00:01:42.690
troubleshoot issues, provide suggestions.
49

49

00:01:42.690  -->  00:01:43.680
There are two modules.
50

50

00:01:43.680  -->  00:01:46.470
There is the data collector and the analyzer.
51

51

00:01:46.470  -->  00:01:50.070
This supports Windows Server 2008 and later.
52

52

00:01:50.070  -->  00:01:52.770
And so when we want to have EC2Rescue
53

53

00:01:52.770  -->  00:01:54.360
onto our EC2 instance,
54

54

00:01:54.360  -->  00:01:57.390
all we have to do is to run command from SSM,
55

55

00:01:57.390  -->  00:01:58.380
which will install it.
56

56

00:01:58.380  -->  00:01:59.213
For example,
57

57

00:01:59.213  -->  00:02:02.100
the run EC2Rescue tool for Windows.
58

58

00:02:02.100  -->  00:02:03.773
The commands are CollectLogs,
59

59

00:02:03.773  -->  00:02:04.740
to collect all the logs,
60

60

00:02:04.740  -->  00:02:05.910
FixAll to fix things,
61

61

00:02:05.910  -->  00:02:07.140
or ResetAccess, for example,
62

62

00:02:07.140  -->  00:02:08.220
as we saw before,
63

63

00:02:08.220  -->  00:02:10.050
to reset passwords.
64

64

00:02:10.050  -->  00:02:12.720
Then if you wanted to troubleshoot connectivity issues,
65

65

00:02:12.720  -->  00:02:13.553
for example,
66

66

00:02:13.553  -->  00:02:15.616
we can just execute the EC2Rescue,
67

67

00:02:15.616  -->  00:02:20.610
and the results can be uploaded directly into an S3 bucket.
68

68

00:02:20.610  -->  00:02:24.000
So use cases for the rescue tool for Windows server
69

69

00:02:24.000  -->  00:02:26.430
is around instance connectivity issues.
70

70

00:02:26.430  -->  00:02:30.480
So firewall, RDP, or network interface configuration.
71

71

00:02:30.480  -->  00:02:32.670
Any operating system boot issue such as,
72

72

00:02:32.670  -->  00:02:34.110
a blue screen of death,
73

73

00:02:34.110  -->  00:02:35.880
or a stop error,
74

74

00:02:35.880  -->  00:02:36.798
or a boot loop,
75

75

00:02:36.798  -->  00:02:39.330
or a corrupted registry.
76

76

00:02:39.330  -->  00:02:42.120
It can gather OS logs and configuration files.
77

77

00:02:42.120  -->  00:02:43.920
So, if you need more advanced
78

78

00:02:43.920  -->  00:02:45.930
log analysis and troubleshooting.
79

79

00:02:45.930  -->  00:02:48.900
And you can troubleshoot common OS issues such as,
80

80

00:02:48.900  -->  00:02:50.730
disk signature collision,
81

81

00:02:50.730  -->  00:02:53.070
and you can perform a restore.
82

82

00:02:53.070  -->  00:02:53.903
Alright, that's it.
83

83

00:02:53.903  -->  00:02:55.170
So just remember at a high level,
84

84

00:02:55.170  -->  00:02:56.003
what this tool is,
85

85

00:02:56.003  -->  00:02:57.780
but it should give you a bit more information
86

86

00:02:57.780  -->  00:02:59.340
so you can understand it better.
87

87

00:02:59.340  -->  00:03:00.330
So I hope you liked it,
88

88

00:03:00.330  -->  00:03:02.403
and I will see you in the next lecture.
