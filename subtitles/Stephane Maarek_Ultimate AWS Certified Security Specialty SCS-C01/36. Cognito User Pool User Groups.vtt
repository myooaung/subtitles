00:00:00.510  -->  00:00:01.500
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about</v>
2

2

00:00:01.500  -->  00:00:03.363
Cognito User Pool Groups.
3

3

00:00:04.888  -->  00:00:07.445
So it's a logical collection of users
4

4

00:00:07.445  -->  00:00:09.510
in a Cognito User Pool.
5

5

00:00:09.510  -->  00:00:11.640
So it's similar to what we see in IAM,
6

6

00:00:11.640  -->  00:00:12.870
and the concepts are similar,
7

7

00:00:12.870  -->  00:00:15.030
we just need to know that it exists in Cognito as well.
8

8

00:00:15.030  -->  00:00:18.990
So we have a group, for example, made of Alice and Bob,
9

9

00:00:18.990  -->  00:00:22.500
and we attach an IAM role to this group.
10

10

00:00:22.500  -->  00:00:24.990
So the ReadersIAMRole, for example,
11

11

00:00:24.990  -->  00:00:28.110
and then they can read DynamoDB with the correct policy.
12

12

00:00:28.110  -->  00:00:30.180
And we create another group, the editors,
13

13

00:00:30.180  -->  00:00:32.310
and we attach an IAM role to be able to edit
14

14

00:00:32.310  -->  00:00:34.350
and they can write to DynamoDB.
15

15

00:00:34.350  -->  00:00:36.690
So these groups allow us to define permissions
16

16

00:00:36.690  -->  00:00:37.980
for the users in the groups
17

17

00:00:37.980  -->  00:00:39.870
by assigning an IAM role to the group,
18

18

00:00:39.870  -->  00:00:43.020
and the users can be in multiple groups at a time.
19

19

00:00:43.020  -->  00:00:46.380
Now, there is a different concept than IAM with Cognito
20

20

00:00:46.380  -->  00:00:49.320
is that we have a precedent's value for each group.
21

21

00:00:49.320  -->  00:00:52.170
So you assign a number, and then the lowest number
22

22

00:00:52.170  -->  00:00:54.960
will be chosen, and then the IAM role will be applied.
23

23

00:00:54.960  -->  00:00:59.760
So, if Bob is in the readers group and the editors group,
24

24

00:00:59.760  -->  00:01:02.220
then you will have by default
25

25

00:01:02.220  -->  00:01:04.320
the one with the lowest precedence.
26

26

00:01:04.320  -->  00:01:06.900
But you can still choose amongst different IAM roles
27

27

00:01:06.900  -->  00:01:10.680
by specifying the IAM role ARN that you want to assume.
28

28

00:01:10.680  -->  00:01:12.777
So here we have two groups, one is precedence zero,
29

29

00:01:12.777  -->  00:01:15.330
one is precedence one, but Bob can assume both.
30

30

00:01:15.330  -->  00:01:18.210
But just by default, it will assume the one
31

31

00:01:18.210  -->  00:01:20.580
of the lowest precedence.
32

32

00:01:20.580  -->  00:01:21.990
You cannot create nested groups,
33

33

00:01:21.990  -->  00:01:25.200
you cannot have groups of groups, and concept of groups
34

34

00:01:25.200  -->  00:01:29.970
just serve the concept of simplifying security in Cognito.
35

35

00:01:29.970  -->  00:01:31.320
Alright, that's it for this lecture.
36

36

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:34.320
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
