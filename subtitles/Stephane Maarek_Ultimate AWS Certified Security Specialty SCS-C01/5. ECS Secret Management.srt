00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,290
<v Lecturer>So just a short lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01,290  -->  00:00:04,350
on the ECS Integration with the SSM Parameter Store
3

3

00:00:04,350  -->  00:00:05,610
and Secrets Manager
4

4

00:00:05,610  -->  00:00:07,830
but we've seen this from before so just a reminder.
5

5

00:00:07,830  -->  00:00:10,230
So ECS can inject sensitive data
6

6

00:00:10,230  -->  00:00:12,810
for your containers as environment variables
7

7

00:00:12,810  -->  00:00:14,880
which is very helpful for your secrets
8

8

00:00:14,880  -->  00:00:16,200
to get them at runtime.
9

9

00:00:16,200  -->  00:00:18,420
So these secrets can be stored securely
10

10

00:00:18,420  -->  00:00:21,600
in the SSM Parameter Store or Secrets Manager
11

11

00:00:21,600  -->  00:00:23,670
and what we do is that we reference sensitive data
12

12

00:00:23,670  -->  00:00:25,500
in the container definition.
13

13

00:00:25,500  -->  00:00:27,180
So either you have, for example,
14

14

00:00:27,180  -->  00:00:30,930
a secret such as the database password in Secrets Manager
15

15

00:00:30,930  -->  00:00:35,040
and a parameter such as an API key in the Parameter Store,
16

16

00:00:35,040  -->  00:00:36,270
they can both be referenced
17

17

00:00:36,270  -->  00:00:38,550
from your ECS container definition
18

18

00:00:38,550  -->  00:00:41,370
and then your ECS task at boot time
19

19

00:00:41,370  -->  00:00:43,410
will be pulling these secrets
20

20

00:00:43,410  -->  00:00:45,660
and inject them as environment variables.
21

21

00:00:45,660  -->  00:00:48,570
Of course, it must have the correct IAM permissions
22

22

00:00:48,570  -->  00:00:51,120
to Secrets Manager, to the Parameter Store,
23

23

00:00:51,120  -->  00:00:53,850
and also to the underlying KMS key
24

24

00:00:53,850  -->  00:00:56,670
that allowed these secrets to be encrypted.
25

25

00:00:56,670  -->  00:00:59,160
So then from this we can connect to an RDS database
26

26

00:00:59,160  -->  00:01:02,160
or access an API with a proper API key.
27

27

00:01:02,160  -->  00:01:02,993
So that's it.
28

28

00:01:02,993  -->  00:01:05,130
Something you've seen but one last reminder.
29

29

00:01:05,130  -->  00:01:06,270
I hope you liked it
30

30

00:01:06,270  -->  00:01:08,220
and I will see you in the next lecture.
