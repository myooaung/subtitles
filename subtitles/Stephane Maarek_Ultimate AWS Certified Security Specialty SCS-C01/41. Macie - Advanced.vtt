00:00:00.450  -->  00:00:01.560
<v Stephane>So now let's talk about</v>
2

2

00:00:01.560  -->  00:00:02.730
Macie Advanced Concepts.
3

3

00:00:02.730  -->  00:00:05.010
The first one is around data identifiers.
4

4

00:00:05.010  -->  00:00:07.830
So this is the structure that allows you to analyze
5

5

00:00:07.830  -->  00:00:10.830
and identify sensitive data in your S3 buckets.
6

6

00:00:10.830  -->  00:00:13.320
So there are some managed data identifiers that you can get
7

7

00:00:13.320  -->  00:00:16.110
from AWS, and they're designed to detect
8

8

00:00:16.110  -->  00:00:18.270
specific types of sensitive data.
9

9

00:00:18.270  -->  00:00:21.660
For example, AWS has already created some data identifiers
10

10

00:00:21.660  -->  00:00:25.620
for credit card numbers, AWS credentials, and bank accounts.
11

11

00:00:25.620  -->  00:00:27.180
But, of course, you can define
12

12

00:00:27.180  -->  00:00:30.150
your own custom data identifiers in AWS.
13

13

00:00:30.150  -->  00:00:32.250
So you'll refine what you want,
14

14

00:00:32.250  -->  00:00:35.640
and then you can specify using a regular expression,
15

15

00:00:35.640  -->  00:00:38.430
or some keywords, or some proximity rules.
16

16

00:00:38.430  -->  00:00:41.400
For example, you want to say that the employee's ID
17

17

00:00:41.400  -->  00:00:44.940
internally of your company should be detected by Macie
18

18

00:00:44.940  -->  00:00:47.490
in your S3 buckets or your customer account numbers.
19

19

00:00:47.490  -->  00:00:48.323
And so, how does that work?
20

20

00:00:48.323  -->  00:00:50.400
Well, in Macie you're going to create
21

21

00:00:50.400  -->  00:00:54.240
a custom data identifier for your employee ID, for example,
22

22

00:00:54.240  -->  00:00:56.400
and this is the Regex I have for it.
23

23

00:00:56.400  -->  00:00:58.650
And then, using Macie, you're going to analyze
24

24

00:00:58.650  -->  00:01:00.720
that data on your S3 buckets,
25

25

00:01:00.720  -->  00:01:03.420
and then Macie will return any sensitive data
26

26

00:01:03.420  -->  00:01:07.050
that has been detected based on your custom data identifier.
27

27

00:01:07.050  -->  00:01:09.510
And these two IDs are shown on the diagram
28

28

00:01:09.510  -->  00:01:10.560
on the right-hand side.
29

29

00:01:10.560  -->  00:01:14.280
Do match the Regex I have provided in the blue box.
30

30

00:01:14.280  -->  00:01:16.200
So, also, you can use Allow List
31

31

00:01:16.200  -->  00:01:18.240
to define a text patterns to ignore.
32

32

00:01:18.240  -->  00:01:21.240
So, for example, if there are some public phone numbers
33

33

00:01:21.240  -->  00:01:23.670
and you don't want them to be detected by Macie,
34

34

00:01:23.670  -->  00:01:26.313
you can define them as an Allow List.
35

35

00:01:27.360  -->  00:01:30.390
So Macie has findings, and findings are a report
36

36

00:01:30.390  -->  00:01:32.820
of a potential issue or a sensitive data
37

37

00:01:32.820  -->  00:01:34.230
that Macie has found.
38

38

00:01:34.230  -->  00:01:37.230
And you have severity rating, effective resources,
39

39

00:01:37.230  -->  00:01:39.270
as well as a timestamp.
40

40

00:01:39.270  -->  00:01:42.180
Out of this, you get the sensitive data discovery results,
41

41

00:01:42.180  -->  00:01:44.640
which is a record that logs the details
42

42

00:01:44.640  -->  00:01:47.730
about the analysis of a specific S3 object.
43

43

00:01:47.730  -->  00:01:50.670
And you can configure Macie to store all these results
44

44

00:01:50.670  -->  00:01:55.670
in S3, and then you can query them in bulk using Athena.
45

45

00:01:55.710  -->  00:01:58.680
Next, you can define suppression rules to, basically,
46

46

00:01:58.680  -->  00:02:02.430
archive findings automatically based on some filter.
47

47

00:02:02.430  -->  00:02:05.100
All the findings in Macie are stored for 90 days,
48

48

00:02:05.100  -->  00:02:08.580
and you can review them using the AWS Console,
49

49

00:02:08.580  -->  00:02:09.810
the EventBridge service,
50

50

00:02:09.810  -->  00:02:13.860
or they will be sent directly into the Security Hub.
51

51

00:02:13.860  -->  00:02:15.990
So finding types can be related to policies.
52

52

00:02:15.990  -->  00:02:18.540
For example, there is a policy evaluation
53

53

00:02:18.540  -->  00:02:21.090
regarding the security of your S3 buckets.
54

54

00:02:21.090  -->  00:02:23.610
For example, the default encryption is disabled
55

55

00:02:23.610  -->  00:02:24.690
or your bucket is public.
56

56

00:02:24.690  -->  00:02:27.510
So this is the kind of findings that could come up.
57

57

00:02:27.510  -->  00:02:31.650
And these changes are detected only after you enable Macie.
58

58

00:02:31.650  -->  00:02:33.780
You can also have sensitive data findings.
59

59

00:02:33.780  -->  00:02:36.210
So this is where sensitive data has been found
60

60

00:02:36.210  -->  00:02:38.790
on your S3 buckets based on your data identifiers.
61

61

00:02:38.790  -->  00:02:40.860
So it could be credentials, private keys,
62

62

00:02:40.860  -->  00:02:42.840
financials, such as credit card numbers.
63

63

00:02:42.840  -->  00:02:45.600
And this is the kind of finding that would be created.
64

64

00:02:45.600  -->  00:02:48.420
And if you have created a custom data identifier,
65

65

00:02:48.420  -->  00:02:52.890
it will have a custom identifier in the finding itself.
66

66

00:02:52.890  -->  00:02:55.950
Finally, Macie is compatible with multi-account strategy.
67

67

00:02:55.950  -->  00:02:59.130
So you can manage multiple accounts through an organization.
68

68

00:02:59.130  -->  00:03:01.920
You'll have administrator accounts and then member accounts.
69

69

00:03:01.920  -->  00:03:04.230
And then this is the same as other services.
70

70

00:03:04.230  -->  00:03:07.200
So you invite through Macie, and it supports
71

71

00:03:07.200  -->  00:03:10.740
the delegated administrative feature of an organization.
72

72

00:03:10.740  -->  00:03:13.680
Now admin accounts can add and remove member accounts,
73

73

00:03:13.680  -->  00:03:16.050
and they will have access to S3-sensitive data
74

74

00:03:16.050  -->  00:03:18.810
and settings for all accounts, so it's quite powerful.
75

75

00:03:18.810  -->  00:03:21.240
And you can also manage the Automated Sensitive
76

76

00:03:21.240  -->  00:03:24.570
Data Discovery and you can run Data Discovery jobs.
77

77

00:03:24.570  -->  00:03:26.970
It can manage, also, data identifiers at scale
78

78

00:03:26.970  -->  00:03:28.590
as well as findings.
79

79

00:03:28.590  -->  00:03:30.960
So this is the same kind of graph. You've seen it before.
80

80

00:03:30.960  -->  00:03:33.630
Just remember that Macie has the possibility
81

81

00:03:33.630  -->  00:03:36.240
to have a delegated administrator account
82

82

00:03:36.240  -->  00:03:37.500
in your organization.
83

83

00:03:37.500  -->  00:03:41.370
That is not the main account of your organization.
84

84

00:03:41.370  -->  00:03:43.080
Alright, that's it for this lecture.
85

85

00:03:43.080  -->  00:03:46.080
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
