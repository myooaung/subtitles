00:00:00.090  -->  00:00:02.220
<v Instructor>So, congratulations on making it</v>
2

2

00:00:02.220  -->  00:00:03.360
all the way to here.
3

3

00:00:03.360  -->  00:00:07.080
Now, let's prepare for your security specialty exam.
4

4

00:00:07.080  -->  00:00:09.600
So, the course covers all the services
5

5

00:00:09.600  -->  00:00:11.100
that I think will go in the exam,
6

6

00:00:11.100  -->  00:00:14.520
but it's possible you will see a service in the exam
7

7

00:00:14.520  -->  00:00:16.830
that is not an answer to the question,
8

8

00:00:16.830  -->  00:00:18.300
I call this a distractor.
9

9

00:00:18.300  -->  00:00:21.060
Because there are over 200 AWS services,
10

10

00:00:21.060  -->  00:00:22.080
we can't cover them all,
11

11

00:00:22.080  -->  00:00:24.090
but if you know Cloud Practitioner,
12

12

00:00:24.090  -->  00:00:25.890
if you know Solution Architect Associates,
13

13

00:00:25.890  -->  00:00:27.300
you already have a really good coverage
14

14

00:00:27.300  -->  00:00:28.620
on what could be a good answer,
15

15

00:00:28.620  -->  00:00:31.200
and then this course gives you specialized knowledge
16

16

00:00:31.200  -->  00:00:34.470
on the services that I think are at the exam.
17

17

00:00:34.470  -->  00:00:36.420
So, this is from my research and my experience,
18

18

00:00:36.420  -->  00:00:39.120
and the feedback that I get from students.
19

19

00:00:39.120  -->  00:00:42.120
So if you see a practice exam that is not mine,
20

20

00:00:42.120  -->  00:00:44.550
but that is covering a service that I don't cover
21

21

00:00:44.550  -->  00:00:46.410
in this course, don't panic,
22

22

00:00:46.410  -->  00:00:49.770
I must have intentionally left it out in my course.
23

23

00:00:49.770  -->  00:00:51.870
Now if you do go to the exam,
24

24

00:00:51.870  -->  00:00:54.960
and you do find a service that you think is an answer
25

25

00:00:54.960  -->  00:00:57.570
to the question you have, and I don't cover it,
26

26

00:00:57.570  -->  00:01:00.000
or a service feature that I don't cover,
27

27

00:01:00.000  -->  00:01:02.760
I would love if you can please let me know at this link,
28

28

00:01:02.760  -->  00:01:04.290
I will show you right now.
29

29

00:01:04.290  -->  00:01:06.030
So, fairly simple, you open the link.
30

30

00:01:06.030  -->  00:01:09.090
You scroll down, you choose Security Specialty.
31

31

00:01:09.090  -->  00:01:10.950
And then you say it's Your Exam Experience.
32

32

00:01:10.950  -->  00:01:12.780
And here, you write your feedback
33

33

00:01:12.780  -->  00:01:14.670
around the type of questions you had, and so on,
34

34

00:01:14.670  -->  00:01:15.870
this is anonymous.
35

35

00:01:15.870  -->  00:01:17.550
If you will allow me
36

36

00:01:17.550  -->  00:01:19.320
to reach back to you in case I have questions,
37

37

00:01:19.320  -->  00:01:21.630
you can leave your email here, but this is optional.
38

38

00:01:21.630  -->  00:01:24.420
And because you leave an answer, that doesn't mean
39

39

00:01:24.420  -->  00:01:25.530
I'm going to send you an email.
40

40

00:01:25.530  -->  00:01:28.380
Okay? Just in case if I need some clarification.
41

41

00:01:28.380  -->  00:01:29.790
But I really appreciate you doing this
42

42

00:01:29.790  -->  00:01:31.650
because you will help the next students
43

43

00:01:31.650  -->  00:01:34.980
get the best knowledge they have for their exam.
44

44

00:01:34.980  -->  00:01:36.780
So, how will the exam work?
45

45

00:01:36.780  -->  00:01:40.770
Well, you have to register online at aws.training.
46

46

00:01:40.770  -->  00:01:43.470
The fee for the exam is 300 US dollars.
47

47

00:01:43.470  -->  00:01:45.150
Although if you've passed an exam before,
48

48

00:01:45.150  -->  00:01:46.470
you can get 50% discount,
49

49

00:01:46.470  -->  00:01:48.510
you'll have a video on this in this course.
50

50

00:01:48.510  -->  00:01:52.290
No notes are allowed, no pen is allowed, no speaking.
51

51

00:01:52.290  -->  00:01:54.330
And in the exam, you will have 65 questions
52

52

00:01:54.330  -->  00:01:57.300
to answer in 170 minutes.
53

53

00:01:57.300  -->  00:01:58.680
But you can get some minutes extra
54

54

00:01:58.680  -->  00:02:01.350
if you're a non-native English speaker.
55

55

00:02:01.350  -->  00:02:03.630
And at the end, you can optionally review
56

56

00:02:03.630  -->  00:02:06.600
all the questions and answers you have replied to,
57

57

00:02:06.600  -->  00:02:07.890
you can even flag them to know
58

58

00:02:07.890  -->  00:02:09.600
which ones you want to review.
59

59

00:02:09.600  -->  00:02:10.890
You will know a few days later
60

60

00:02:10.890  -->  00:02:12.930
if you passed or failed the exam,
61

61

00:02:12.930  -->  00:02:16.920
and you will know your overall score at the very same time.
62

62

00:02:16.920  -->  00:02:19.380
You will never know which answers were right or wrong,
63

63

00:02:19.380  -->  00:02:20.610
you can only guess.
64

64

00:02:20.610  -->  00:02:25.560
And to pass, you need a score of at least 750 out of 1,000.
65

65

00:02:25.560  -->  00:02:28.650
So, you have some margin for error, but not too much.
66

66

00:02:28.650  -->  00:02:30.180
In case you fail, no problem,
67

67

00:02:30.180  -->  00:02:32.790
you can retake the exam 14 days later,
68

68

00:02:32.790  -->  00:02:34.860
and of course you have to pay again.
69

69

00:02:34.860  -->  00:02:37.590
Now, let's have a look at the exam guide to see
70

70

00:02:37.590  -->  00:02:39.360
if we are ready for the exam.
71

71

00:02:39.360  -->  00:02:43.020
So, here I am on the certifications page, and we can have
72

72

00:02:43.020  -->  00:02:46.590
a look at the exam guide and the sample questions.
73

73

00:02:46.590  -->  00:02:48.870
So, the sample questions you can do in your own time,
74

74

00:02:48.870  -->  00:02:51.060
and you should feel that the course covers
75

75

00:02:51.060  -->  00:02:53.400
everything in there, and that if you want
76

76

00:02:53.400  -->  00:02:55.410
to check your answers at the very bottom,
77

77

00:02:55.410  -->  00:02:58.320
you will have the answers to every single question.
78

78

00:02:58.320  -->  00:02:59.640
So, you're good to go.
79

79

00:02:59.640  -->  00:03:01.380
Now for the exam guide, let's have a look,
80

80

00:03:01.380  -->  00:03:04.770
so let's look at the important part within.
81

81

00:03:04.770  -->  00:03:07.410
So, we have multiple choice, where one correct response
82

82

00:03:07.410  -->  00:03:10.050
and three incorrect responses exist,
83

83

00:03:10.050  -->  00:03:12.000
and multiple response when you have two or more
84

84

00:03:12.000  -->  00:03:15.330
correct responses out of five or more options.
85

85

00:03:15.330  -->  00:03:18.540
So, they say that there is 15 questions are unscored.
86

86

00:03:18.540  -->  00:03:21.570
So sometimes, AWS is testing new questions.
87

87

00:03:21.570  -->  00:03:24.090
And so, you will have these test questions,
88

88

00:03:24.090  -->  00:03:26.160
but it turns out that even if you answer them
89

89

00:03:26.160  -->  00:03:28.890
right or wrong, they will not count towards your score,
90

90

00:03:28.890  -->  00:03:31.290
and only 50 questions affect your score.
91

91

00:03:31.290  -->  00:03:33.000
But of course, you do not know which ones.
92

92

00:03:33.000  -->  00:03:35.730
This is just a way for AWS to test new questions
93

93

00:03:35.730  -->  00:03:37.860
and introduce them in the exam to make sure
94

94

00:03:37.860  -->  00:03:39.660
they are the proper difficulty,
95

95

00:03:39.660  -->  00:03:42.270
and that students pass them on average at,
96

96

00:03:42.270  -->  00:03:43.890
I don't know how many percent.
97

97

00:03:43.890  -->  00:03:46.440
So, the exam result is going to be communicated
98

98

00:03:46.440  -->  00:03:48.540
after the exam, after a few days.
99

99

00:03:48.540  -->  00:03:51.420
You have the five domains as outlined in this course.
100

100

00:03:51.420  -->  00:03:53.190
As you can see, most of it is going
101

101

00:03:53.190  -->  00:03:55.260
to be around infrastructure security,
102

102

00:03:55.260  -->  00:03:56.760
identity and access management,
103

103

00:03:56.760  -->  00:03:59.400
data protection, and logging and monitoring.
104

104

00:03:59.400  -->  00:04:02.910
So here, the domains are described at a pretty high level,
105

105

00:04:02.910  -->  00:04:05.520
I would say, which is around like more job functions
106

106

00:04:05.520  -->  00:04:07.680
than actual services and features.
107

107

00:04:07.680  -->  00:04:10.260
Yet it is still very important for you to read them
108

108

00:04:10.260  -->  00:04:12.660
and see how you feel about those.
109

109

00:04:12.660  -->  00:04:15.960
But this is high level overview, I would say.
110

110

00:04:15.960  -->  00:04:18.810
And more importantly, well, the appendix is telling you
111

111

00:04:18.810  -->  00:04:22.110
which tools are going to be covered in the exam.
112

112

00:04:22.110  -->  00:04:23.850
And here, you have a list of the services
113

113

00:04:23.850  -->  00:04:25.800
that may be covered in the exam,
114

114

00:04:25.800  -->  00:04:28.260
but they will not have all the services, because well,
115

115

00:04:28.260  -->  00:04:32.580
security is affecting every single AWS service, of course.
116

116

00:04:32.580  -->  00:04:35.250
So, you will not see, for example, Amazon S3 in here
117

117

00:04:35.250  -->  00:04:38.550
because well, Amazon S3, it just has a security module
118

118

00:04:38.550  -->  00:04:39.990
that we cover in this course.
119

119

00:04:39.990  -->  00:04:41.970
But in terms of management governance,
120

120

00:04:41.970  -->  00:04:43.290
you have all of these.
121

121

00:04:43.290  -->  00:04:44.760
Networking content delivery,
122

122

00:04:44.760  -->  00:04:47.490
you have all of these, and security and compliance,
123

123

00:04:47.490  -->  00:04:48.780
you have all of these.
124

124

00:04:48.780  -->  00:04:49.613
And then you have
125

125

00:04:49.613  -->  00:04:52.080
out of scope services that are not covered in this course.
126

126

00:04:52.080  -->  00:04:56.400
Now, if you see something in the course that is not covered
127

127

00:04:56.400  -->  00:04:58.650
in the course, but that appears at your exam, again,
128

128

00:04:58.650  -->  00:05:01.320
please submit this feedback form to me,
129

129

00:05:01.320  -->  00:05:04.470
and I will make sure to include the updates in the course,
130

130

00:05:04.470  -->  00:05:07.890
I usually, I'm very efficient at including that content,
131

131

00:05:07.890  -->  00:05:09.750
so that helps everyone.
132

132

00:05:09.750  -->  00:05:10.919
Okay?
133

133

00:05:10.919  -->  00:05:12.150
So, that's it for this lecture, I hope you liked it.
134

134

00:05:12.150  -->  00:05:14.853
Happy reading, and I will see you in the next lecture.
