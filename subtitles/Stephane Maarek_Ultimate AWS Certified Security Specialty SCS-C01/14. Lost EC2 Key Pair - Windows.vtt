00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:01.380
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about</v>
2

2

00:00:01.380  -->  00:00:03.990
how we can recover a Windows EC2 instance
3

3

00:00:03.990  -->  00:00:05.610
where we have a lost password.
4

4

00:00:05.610  -->  00:00:07.650
So again, it has an EBS root volume.
5

5

00:00:07.650  -->  00:00:09.000
So what can we do?
6

6

00:00:09.000  -->  00:00:14.000
Well if the Windows AMI is using the EC2Launch v2 service,
7

7

00:00:15.000  -->  00:00:18.540
then all we have to do is to detach the EBS root volume
8

8

00:00:18.540  -->  00:00:21.360
and attach it to a temporary EC2 instance
9

9

00:00:21.360  -->  00:00:22.290
running Windows as well.
10

10

00:00:22.290  -->  00:00:24.450
So similar method as before.
11

11

00:00:24.450  -->  00:00:27.030
And then on the secondary volume,
12

12

00:00:27.030  -->  00:00:30.750
we're going to delete a file called the run-once file.
13

13

00:00:30.750  -->  00:00:31.590
What's going to happen is
14

14

00:00:31.590  -->  00:00:34.620
that it's going to make the old EC2 instance
15

15

00:00:34.620  -->  00:00:37.830
believe this is the first time it's being run.
16

16

00:00:37.830  -->  00:00:38.700
So we delete that file,
17

17

00:00:38.700  -->  00:00:42.030
we reattach the volume onto the EC2 instance,
18

18

00:00:42.030  -->  00:00:42.960
we restart it,
19

19

00:00:42.960  -->  00:00:46.290
and then because the instance believes it is its first boot,
20

20

00:00:46.290  -->  00:00:48.810
it's going to say, "Please enter a new password"
21

21

00:00:48.810  -->  00:00:51.513
and we have recovered our EC2 instance.
22

22

00:00:52.470  -->  00:00:54.960
If we are using a older AMI,
23

23

00:00:54.960  -->  00:00:58.950
so Windows AMI before Windows server 2016,
24

24

00:00:58.950  -->  00:00:59.790
so this is an older AMI,
25

25

00:00:59.790  -->  00:01:02.340
it's called the EC2Config service.
26

26

00:01:02.340  -->  00:01:05.040
And we have a similar kind of methodology.
27

27

00:01:05.040  -->  00:01:08.310
So we again create a new EC2 instance
28

28

00:01:08.310  -->  00:01:10.650
but this time the file we have to modify
29

29

00:01:10.650  -->  00:01:11.610
is this file right here.
30

30

00:01:11.610  -->  00:01:13.650
You don't have to remember the files, okay,
31

31

00:01:13.650  -->  00:01:15.750
I'm just giving you the general idea
32

32

00:01:15.750  -->  00:01:17.310
and that should be enough for you.
33

33

00:01:17.310  -->  00:01:19.020
But in that XML file
34

34

00:01:19.020  -->  00:01:23.670
there is the EC2 set password variable.
35

35

00:01:23.670  -->  00:01:26.970
And if you set it to enabled,
36

36

00:01:26.970  -->  00:01:30.720
then it's actually going to allow you to set a new password.
37

37

00:01:30.720  -->  00:01:33.180
So you restart the previous instance
38

38

00:01:33.180  -->  00:01:34.740
and then you'll have to enter a new password
39

39

00:01:34.740  -->  00:01:38.790
and you are back into the EC2 instance.
40

40

00:01:38.790  -->  00:01:40.320
There's also a thing called EC2Launch.
41

41

00:01:40.320  -->  00:01:45.120
So this is for the Windows server 2016 and later AMIs,
42

42

00:01:45.120  -->  00:01:46.590
but they're not, again,
43

43

00:01:46.590  -->  00:01:47.423
they haven't been upgraded
44

44

00:01:47.423  -->  00:01:49.980
to the newer version EC2Launch v2.
45

45

00:01:49.980  -->  00:01:53.070
So the method is again very, very similar.
46

46

00:01:53.070  -->  00:01:55.290
But this time we're going to download and install
47

47

00:01:55.290  -->  00:01:58.470
what's called the EC2Rescue Tool for Windows Server.
48

48

00:01:58.470  -->  00:02:00.870
And then from this EC2Rescue Tool,
49

49

00:02:00.870  -->  00:02:02.610
you have a few steps to follow
50

50

00:02:02.610  -->  00:02:04.080
and by going into the options
51

51

00:02:04.080  -->  00:02:06.750
you have one called the Reset Administrator Password
52

52

00:02:06.750  -->  00:02:09.390
which does exactly what the name indicates.
53

53

00:02:09.390  -->  00:02:10.890
Then you attach the volume back
54

54

00:02:10.890  -->  00:02:12.840
to the previous EC2 instance, restart it,
55

55

00:02:12.840  -->  00:02:15.633
and then you will have a new admin password.
56

56

00:02:16.470  -->  00:02:19.770
Finally, you may have a method using Systems Manager.
57

57

00:02:19.770  -->  00:02:22.800
So for this, of course, the EC2 instance running Windows
58

58

00:02:22.800  -->  00:02:25.080
must have the SSM Agent installed.
59

59

00:02:25.080  -->  00:02:26.250
And we have three methods.
60

60

00:02:26.250  -->  00:02:29.820
The first one is to use this document called
61

61

00:02:29.820  -->  00:02:33.840
the AWSSupport-RunEC2RescueForWindows Tool
62

62

00:02:33.840  -->  00:02:36.510
which is going to install the EC2Rescue Tool
63

63

00:02:36.510  -->  00:02:38.670
and then you can reset the access.
64

64

00:02:38.670  -->  00:02:39.990
That's similar to what we saw before
65

65

00:02:39.990  -->  00:02:43.020
but it's automated using Systems Manager
66

66

00:02:43.020  -->  00:02:46.710
or there is an automation document again called ResetAccess
67

67

00:02:46.710  -->  00:02:48.750
or there is a run command document
68

68

00:02:48.750  -->  00:02:51.030
called RunPowerShellScript
69

69

00:02:51.030  -->  00:02:53.820
in which you can just set the password for the administrator
70

70

00:02:53.820  -->  00:02:57.270
to be Password@123 and then you are good.
71

71

00:02:57.270  -->  00:02:59.430
Alright, so hopefully that gives you lots of options
72

72

00:02:59.430  -->  00:03:01.620
to recover EC2 Windows instances
73

73

00:03:01.620  -->  00:03:03.210
when you have lost a password.
74

74

00:03:03.210  -->  00:03:06.243
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
