00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:01.980
<v Instructor>Now let's talk about CloudFront.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.980  -->  00:00:05.010
CloudFront is a content delivery network, or CDN,
3

3

00:00:05.010  -->  00:00:08.610
so anytime you see CDN at the exam, think CloudFront.
4

4

00:00:08.610  -->  00:00:10.440
It improves the read performance
5

5

00:00:10.440  -->  00:00:12.960
by caching the content of your website
6

6

00:00:12.960  -->  00:00:14.910
at the different edge locations.
7

7

00:00:14.910  -->  00:00:18.090
And because your content is cached all around the world,
8

8

00:00:18.090  -->  00:00:19.650
then your users all around the world
9

9

00:00:19.650  -->  00:00:21.180
will have a lower latency,
10

10

00:00:21.180  -->  00:00:23.640
and this will improve the user experience.
11

11

00:00:23.640  -->  00:00:27.900
CloudFront is made of 216 points of presence globally,
12

12

00:00:27.900  -->  00:00:32.010
which correspond to the AWS edge locations around the world.
13

13

00:00:32.010  -->  00:00:33.960
And AWS keeps on adding locations
14

14

00:00:33.960  -->  00:00:37.350
to improve user experience even further everywhere.
15

15

00:00:37.350  -->  00:00:40.770
On top of it, by having the content distributed globally
16

16

00:00:40.770  -->  00:00:42.810
we are getting DDoS protection.
17

17

00:00:42.810  -->  00:00:44.670
So DDoS is a sort of attack
18

18

00:00:44.670  -->  00:00:46.350
where all your servers around the world
19

19

00:00:46.350  -->  00:00:47.580
are getting attacked at the same time,
20

20

00:00:47.580  -->  00:00:49.500
we'll see this later on in this course,
21

21

00:00:49.500  -->  00:00:50.610
and the idea is that CloudFront
22

22

00:00:50.610  -->  00:00:52.740
because your application is worldwide,
23

23

00:00:52.740  -->  00:00:54.630
then you're protected against these attacks,
24

24

00:00:54.630  -->  00:00:56.520
also using something called Shield
25

25

00:00:56.520  -->  00:00:58.170
and Web Application Firewall,
26

26

00:00:58.170  -->  00:01:00.570
that we will be seeing in the security section.
27

27

00:01:00.570  -->  00:01:03.300
So if we wanted to look at a map of the world,
28

28

00:01:03.300  -->  00:01:06.330
these are the map and we see some edge locations
29

29

00:01:06.330  -->  00:01:07.800
as well at edge caches.
30

30

00:01:07.800  -->  00:01:10.590
And so say we had created an S3 bucket and a website
31

31

00:01:10.590  -->  00:01:13.020
on our S3 bucket in Australia,
32

32

00:01:13.020  -->  00:01:15.690
but we had a user maybe in America,
33

33

00:01:15.690  -->  00:01:16.830
then what the user will do
34

34

00:01:16.830  -->  00:01:18.600
is that it will request the content
35

35

00:01:18.600  -->  00:01:21.420
from an American edge location using CloudFront,
36

36

00:01:21.420  -->  00:01:22.410
and CloudFront will be able
37

37

00:01:22.410  -->  00:01:24.750
to fetch the content from Australia.
38

38

00:01:24.750  -->  00:01:26.370
Now, if another user in the US
39

39

00:01:26.370  -->  00:01:28.260
will be requesting the same content,
40

40

00:01:28.260  -->  00:01:30.300
then it will be served directly from the edge
41

41

00:01:30.300  -->  00:01:31.440
and it will not go all the way
42

42

00:01:31.440  -->  00:01:33.300
to Australia to serve that content.
43

43

00:01:33.300  -->  00:01:35.250
Same if a user is in China,
44

44

00:01:35.250  -->  00:01:38.160
then it will be talking to a Chinese point of presence
45

45

00:01:38.160  -->  00:01:40.680
and then redirected to the S3 bucket,
46

46

00:01:40.680  -->  00:01:43.620
and then the content will be cached at the edge.
47

47

00:01:43.620  -->  00:01:45.840
CloudFront has several type of origins.
48

48

00:01:45.840  -->  00:01:47.580
For example, you have S3 bucket,
49

49

00:01:47.580  -->  00:01:49.200
which is used to distribute files
50

50

00:01:49.200  -->  00:01:52.680
and cache them at the edge using CloudFront.
51

51

00:01:52.680  -->  00:01:54.540
And to guarantee that only CloudFront
52

52

00:01:54.540  -->  00:01:56.070
can access your S3 bucket,
53

53

00:01:56.070  -->  00:01:59.400
you can use something called the Origin Access Control, OAC,
54

54

00:01:59.400  -->  00:02:03.540
which is replacing the older Origin Access identity, OAI.
55

55

00:02:03.540  -->  00:02:05.430
CloudFront can also be used as a way
56

56

00:02:05.430  -->  00:02:07.230
to send data into an S3 bucket.
57

57

00:02:07.230  -->  00:02:09.090
So to upload data to file to S3,
58

58

00:02:09.090  -->  00:02:11.100
which is called an ingress.
59

59

00:02:11.100  -->  00:02:13.200
You can have CloudFront as well instead
60

60

00:02:13.200  -->  00:02:17.280
in front of any custom origin HTTP backend.
61

61

00:02:17.280  -->  00:02:19.320
So that could be an Application Load Balancer,
62

62

00:02:19.320  -->  00:02:21.090
that could be an EC2 instance,
63

63

00:02:21.090  -->  00:02:22.170
and the S3 website,
64

64

00:02:22.170  -->  00:02:26.280
but first you must enable the bucket as a static S3 website,
65

65

00:02:26.280  -->  00:02:29.790
or really any HTTP backend you want.
66

66

00:02:29.790  -->  00:02:31.860
So at a high level, how does CloudFront work?
67

67

00:02:31.860  -->  00:02:34.980
We have the edge location all around the world, okay?
68

68

00:02:34.980  -->  00:02:37.230
And then it will be connecting to your origin.
69

69

00:02:37.230  -->  00:02:41.010
So would it be an S3 bucket or an HTTP server?
70

70

00:02:41.010  -->  00:02:42.630
And when the client connects
71

71

00:02:42.630  -->  00:02:46.260
and does an HTTP request into your edge location,
72

72

00:02:46.260  -->  00:02:48.600
then the edge location will see
73

73

00:02:48.600  -->  00:02:51.000
if it has it in the cache.
74

74

00:02:51.000  -->  00:02:52.650
If it doesn't have it in the cache,
75

75

00:02:52.650  -->  00:02:56.520
then it will go to the origin to get the request results.
76

76

00:02:56.520  -->  00:02:58.320
And then once you retrieve the results,
77

77

00:02:58.320  -->  00:03:00.420
it will be caching it into a local cache
78

78

00:03:00.420  -->  00:03:03.000
so that if another client requests the same content
79

79

00:03:03.000  -->  00:03:04.620
from the same edge location,
80

80

00:03:04.620  -->  00:03:05.880
then the edge location does not
81

81

00:03:05.880  -->  00:03:08.280
need to go to the origin.
82

82

00:03:08.280  -->  00:03:10.350
So if we have S3 as an origin,
83

83

00:03:10.350  -->  00:03:11.640
then if we look at the cloud,
84

84

00:03:11.640  -->  00:03:14.280
your S3 bucket is your origin in some region,
85

85

00:03:14.280  -->  00:03:16.110
and then you have edge locations all around the world,
86

86

00:03:16.110  -->  00:03:18.480
for example, at Los Angeles.
87

87

00:03:18.480  -->  00:03:21.630
And your users accessing the edge location in Los Angeles
88

88

00:03:21.630  -->  00:03:24.120
will get their content directly served
89

89

00:03:24.120  -->  00:03:25.410
through the edge location,
90

90

00:03:25.410  -->  00:03:26.640
but first the edge location
91

91

00:03:26.640  -->  00:03:29.130
will get it from the origin S3 bucket
92

92

00:03:29.130  -->  00:03:31.020
through the private network.
93

93

00:03:31.020  -->  00:03:32.760
And the S3 bucket will be secured
94

94

00:03:32.760  -->  00:03:34.680
using an Origin Access Control
95

95

00:03:34.680  -->  00:03:38.610
and by modifying the S3 bucket policy on the S3 bucket.
96

96

00:03:38.610  -->  00:03:41.070
So this is the same when we have a user
97

97

00:03:41.070  -->  00:03:43.230
in Sao Paulo, for example, in Brazil.
98

98

00:03:43.230  -->  00:03:45.930
Again, this will be another edge location
99

99

00:03:45.930  -->  00:03:48.630
which will be serving users close to Brazil,
100

100

00:03:48.630  -->  00:03:50.610
and then it will be a private connection
101

101

00:03:50.610  -->  00:03:52.170
between your edge location
102

102

00:03:52.170  -->  00:03:54.540
and your S3 bucket, and so on.
103

103

00:03:54.540  -->  00:03:56.820
So using CloudFront and the edge locations,
104

104

00:03:56.820  -->  00:04:00.390
we can see that the content of our S3 bucket in one region
105

105

00:04:00.390  -->  00:04:02.880
can be distributed all around the world
106

106

00:04:02.880  -->  00:04:06.090
through the edge locations or points of presence.
107

107

00:04:06.090  -->  00:04:07.320
So one question that's common
108

108

00:04:07.320  -->  00:04:09.330
is what is the difference between CloudFront
109

109

00:04:09.330  -->  00:04:11.580
and something like S3 Replication?
110

110

00:04:11.580  -->  00:04:12.810
Well, if you have CloudFront,
111

111

00:04:12.810  -->  00:04:14.580
you're using the Global Edge network,
112

112

00:04:14.580  -->  00:04:17.760
so this is about 216 points of presence,
113

113

00:04:17.760  -->  00:04:19.545
and the files are going to be cached
114

114

00:04:19.545  -->  00:04:22.440
in each edge location, maybe for a day.
115

115

00:04:22.440  -->  00:04:24.690
So this is amazing if you have static content
116

116

00:04:24.690  -->  00:04:26.850
that must be able to be available
117

117

00:04:26.850  -->  00:04:28.890
everywhere around the world.
118

118

00:04:28.890  -->  00:04:31.110
S3 Cross-Region Replication is different,
119

119

00:04:31.110  -->  00:04:32.730
it must be set up for each region
120

120

00:04:32.730  -->  00:04:34.050
you want replication to happen,
121

121

00:04:34.050  -->  00:04:36.390
so this is not for every region in the world.
122

122

00:04:36.390  -->  00:04:38.850
And then files are going to be updated in near real-time,
123

123

00:04:38.850  -->  00:04:40.590
so there's no caching that happens.
124

124

00:04:40.590  -->  00:04:42.270
And it is only for read only,
125

125

00:04:42.270  -->  00:04:44.790
and so this is great if you have dynamic content
126

126

00:04:44.790  -->  00:04:46.020
that needs to change all the time
127

127

00:04:46.020  -->  00:04:49.260
and be available at low-latency in a few regions.
128

128

00:04:49.260  -->  00:04:50.940
So they serve very different purposes,
129

129

00:04:50.940  -->  00:04:53.130
CloudFront is a CDN,
130

130

00:04:53.130  -->  00:04:55.830
which is to cache content all around the world,
131

131

00:04:55.830  -->  00:04:57.900
whereas S3 Cross-Region Replication
132

132

00:04:57.900  -->  00:05:01.530
is to really replicate an entire bucket into another region.
133

133

00:05:01.530  -->  00:05:03.080
So hopefully that makes sense about CloudFront.
134

134

00:05:03.080  -->  00:05:04.830
In the next lecture, we'll have a play
135

135

00:05:04.830  -->  00:05:07.200
and see how we can set up a CloudFront distribution
136

136

00:05:07.200  -->  00:05:09.090
on the cloud for an S3 bucket.
137

137

00:05:09.090  -->  00:05:10.990
So I will see you in the next lecture.
