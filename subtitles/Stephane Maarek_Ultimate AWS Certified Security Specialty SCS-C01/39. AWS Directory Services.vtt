00:00:00.100  -->  00:00:03.160
<v Explainer>So the exam as a strong emphasis</v>
2

2

00:00:03.160  -->  00:00:07.460
on Microsoft Active Directory and AWS directory services.
3

3

00:00:07.460  -->  00:00:08.530
So I really wanna make sure
4

4

00:00:08.530  -->  00:00:11.000
that we both understand what this is
5

5

00:00:11.000  -->  00:00:12.090
'cause I think it's quite complicated
6

6

00:00:12.090  -->  00:00:14.160
especially if you're not from Microsoft background
7

7

00:00:14.160  -->  00:00:16.340
and I wanna make sure you choose the right answer
8

8

00:00:16.340  -->  00:00:20.170
at the exam when a question or two comes up on this topic.
9

9

00:00:20.170  -->  00:00:22.190
So, what is Microsoft AD?
10

10

00:00:22.190  -->  00:00:24.660
It's found on any windows server
11

11

00:00:24.660  -->  00:00:27.940
that has something called AD Domain Services.
12

12

00:00:27.940  -->  00:00:30.120
And it's going to a database of objects
13

13

00:00:30.120  -->  00:00:32.060
would it be user accounts, computers,
14

14

00:00:32.060  -->  00:00:34.790
printers, file shares, security groups
15

15

00:00:34.790  -->  00:00:38.280
and it's gonna be centralized way for security management,
16

16

00:00:38.280  -->  00:00:40.710
creating new accounts, assigning partitions all
17

17

00:00:40.710  -->  00:00:43.880
in your windows, in Microsoft environment.
18

18

00:00:43.880  -->  00:00:46.390
And the objects, the users, the accounts, the printers
19

19

00:00:46.390  -->  00:00:48.380
everything they're going to be grouped together
20

20

00:00:48.380  -->  00:00:51.120
and organized into something called a tree.
21

21

00:00:51.120  -->  00:00:53.070
And as the name indicates,(chuckles)
22

22

00:00:53.070  -->  00:00:56.100
a group of trees is called a forest.
23

23

00:00:56.100  -->  00:00:58.180
So, what do we have Microsoft AD?
24

24

00:00:58.180  -->  00:01:00.710
For example, we have a domain controller that knows
25

25

00:01:00.710  -->  00:01:03.460
that John is username and password is the password
26

26

00:01:03.460  -->  00:01:06.000
which is not a very strong password, but anyway
27

27

00:01:06.000  -->  00:01:08.540
and we have other machines
28

28

00:01:08.540  -->  00:01:12.450
Microsoft machines connected to this domain controller.
29

29

00:01:12.450  -->  00:01:15.360
The beautiful thing is that now one can use John password
30

30

00:01:15.360  -->  00:01:18.380
of on any of these machines to connect
31

31

00:01:18.380  -->  00:01:22.130
and the active directory will check the login itself.
32

32

00:01:22.130  -->  00:01:24.480
So that allows us to synchronize sort of
33

33

00:01:24.480  -->  00:01:27.070
all these logins across domain controller.
34

34

00:01:27.070  -->  00:01:30.100
That is something very, very simple simplified as well.
35

35

00:01:30.100  -->  00:01:31.080
Don't get at me
36

36

00:01:31.080  -->  00:01:34.220
if I don't do this exactly perfectly for the Microsoft AD
37

37

00:01:34.220  -->  00:01:36.390
but this is at a high level providing you an idea
38

38

00:01:36.390  -->  00:01:38.750
of how Microsoft AD works.
39

39

00:01:38.750  -->  00:01:40.350
So what is ADFS?
40

40

00:01:40.350  -->  00:01:42.200
Well, ADFS will provide Single-Sign On
41

41

00:01:42.200  -->  00:01:45.570
across applications and it has SAML innovation
42

42

00:01:45.570  -->  00:01:46.403
across third party.
43

43

00:01:46.403  -->  00:01:49.890
For example, the Console, Dropbox, Office 365 and so on.
44

44

00:01:49.890  -->  00:01:51.510
So we've seen how ADFS works.
45

45

00:01:51.510  -->  00:01:53.050
So remember the user
46

46

00:01:53.050  -->  00:01:54.380
will browse to URL
47

47

00:01:54.380  -->  00:01:56.840
in the Microsoft Active Directory Services
48

48

00:01:56.840  -->  00:01:59.840
which will authenticate the user against a Microsoft Active
49

49

00:01:59.840  -->  00:02:00.880
Directory.
50

50

00:02:00.880  -->  00:02:02.650
The SAML Token will be returned to the user
51

51

00:02:02.650  -->  00:02:06.840
and then the we'll exchange it with AWS to get a sign in URL
52

52

00:02:06.840  -->  00:02:08.060
for the console.
53

53

00:02:08.060  -->  00:02:10.320
So we'll see how this will be improved
54

54

00:02:10.320  -->  00:02:13.040
with the SSO service later on.
55

55

00:02:13.040  -->  00:02:16.740
Okay, so now let's get into AWS Directory Services.
56

56

00:02:16.740  -->  00:02:20.300
We have three flavors and this is a managed service by AWS.
57

57

00:02:20.300  -->  00:02:24.630
So the first coin is called AWS Managed Microsoft AD.
58

58

00:02:24.630  -->  00:02:27.020
As you can expect is going to be a Microsoft AD
59

59

00:02:27.020  -->  00:02:28.190
in the Cloud.
60

60

00:02:28.190  -->  00:02:31.580
So you're going to be able to create your own AD in AWS
61

61

00:02:31.580  -->  00:02:35.740
manage users locally, and it has support for MFA.
62

62

00:02:35.740  -->  00:02:38.247
You will have to establish a trust with your on-premise AD
63

63

00:02:38.247  -->  00:02:40.470
and we'll see what that trust looks like.
64

64

00:02:40.470  -->  00:02:43.440
If you want to have some kind of connection
65

65

00:02:43.440  -->  00:02:47.610
between your on-premise AD and your AWS Manage Microsoft AD.
66

66

00:02:47.610  -->  00:02:49.247
So let's have a look here in this diagram,
67

67

00:02:49.247  -->  00:02:52.010
you can see that the Manage AD is connected
68

68

00:02:52.010  -->  00:02:55.110
to the on-premise AD through a trust and it supports MFA
69

69

00:02:55.110  -->  00:02:56.620
and so the users can authenticate
70

70

00:02:56.620  -->  00:02:59.510
on the right hand side or on the left hand side.
71

71

00:02:59.510  -->  00:03:01.830
Then we have Microsoft AD.
72

72

00:03:01.830  -->  00:03:04.850
We have database directory services, AD Connector.
73

73

00:03:04.850  -->  00:03:07.230
So, I wish they name things differently, but anyway,
74

74

00:03:07.230  -->  00:03:09.280
so this is a proxy to make the link
75

75

00:03:09.280  -->  00:03:12.330
from your Cloud AD to your on-premises AD
76

76

00:03:12.330  -->  00:03:13.537
and it supports MFA.
77

77

00:03:13.537  -->  00:03:16.640
And the users are for the only managed in one place
78

78

00:03:16.640  -->  00:03:18.470
which is the on-premise AD.
79

79

00:03:18.470  -->  00:03:20.670
So in this case, the authentication goes
80

80

00:03:20.670  -->  00:03:23.010
to the AD connector, which is a proxy
81

81

00:03:23.010  -->  00:03:24.580
and it gets proxy back
82

82

00:03:24.580  -->  00:03:28.130
onto the on-premise AD to get the response.
83

83

00:03:28.130  -->  00:03:31.200
So in the first case with Microsoft Manage AD
84

84

00:03:31.200  -->  00:03:33.970
we had two places where the users were defined.
85

85

00:03:33.970  -->  00:03:36.890
There were defined on-premise and in the Cloud
86

86

00:03:36.890  -->  00:03:38.940
and there was some trust between the two
87

87

00:03:38.940  -->  00:03:40.080
but with the AD connector
88

88

00:03:40.080  -->  00:03:42.330
they're only defined on-premise
89

89

00:03:42.330  -->  00:03:44.560
and we've defined a proxy to access that
90

90

00:03:44.560  -->  00:03:47.070
on-premise AD directly from the Cloud.
91

91

00:03:47.070  -->  00:03:50.130
Finally, we have Simple AD, which is not Microsoft AD
92

92

00:03:50.130  -->  00:03:52.040
it's a AD-compatible API.
93

93

00:03:52.040  -->  00:03:55.030
It's called Samba and it's managed in AWS
94

94

00:03:55.030  -->  00:03:55.950
but it's standalone
95

95

00:03:55.950  -->  00:03:58.650
and it cannot be joined with an on-premise AD.
96

96

00:03:58.650  -->  00:04:02.140
So in this case with Simple AD, it's a cheaper alternative.
97

97

00:04:02.140  -->  00:04:03.920
It doesn't have as much capability.
98

98

00:04:03.920  -->  00:04:05.720
It doesn't support MFA, for example.
99

99

00:04:06.759  -->  00:04:08.750
It cannot be joined to AWS
100

100

00:04:08.750  -->  00:04:10.780
such as SQL server and so on
101

101

00:04:10.780  -->  00:04:13.290
but contribute simpler, cheaper
102

102

00:04:13.290  -->  00:04:16.050
and maybe a good solution based on the questions you get.
103

103

00:04:16.050  -->  00:04:18.640
So we have three kinds of directory services
104

104

00:04:18.640  -->  00:04:20.370
and I think they're quite clear the differences
105

105

00:04:20.370  -->  00:04:22.830
but I really want to go deep dive into each of
106

106

00:04:22.830  -->  00:04:24.540
those to make it very very clear
107

107

00:04:24.540  -->  00:04:26.010
as to how they're different.
108

108

00:04:26.010  -->  00:04:28.660
So, with AWS managed Microsoft AD,
109

109

00:04:28.660  -->  00:04:31.510
you're going to be deploying Microsoft active directory
110

110

00:04:31.510  -->  00:04:33.130
within your VPC.
111

111

00:04:33.130  -->  00:04:34.040
So here's what it looks like.
112

112

00:04:34.040  -->  00:04:37.738
We have two AZs and we'll have two AD Domain Controller or
113

113

00:04:37.738  -->  00:04:42.120
AD DC deployed in two different for high availability.
114

114

00:04:42.120  -->  00:04:44.140
And now we're going to be able to create easy
115

115

00:04:44.140  -->  00:04:45.890
two windows instances
116

116

00:04:45.890  -->  00:04:47.840
and we can deploy traditional applications
117

117

00:04:47.840  -->  00:04:50.410
on these instances, for example, SharePoint
118

118

00:04:50.410  -->  00:04:53.310
or we can do something called seamless domain join
119

119

00:04:53.310  -->  00:04:56.710
from your Amazon EC2 instances in Multiple Accounts
120

120

00:04:56.710  -->  00:04:59.620
and VPCs directly onto your domain controllers.
121

121

00:04:59.620  -->  00:05:01.550
This is a feature directly coming out of
122

122

00:05:01.550  -->  00:05:03.620
the managed Microsoft AD.
123

123

00:05:03.620  -->  00:05:05.420
And finally we have integrations.
124

124

00:05:05.420  -->  00:05:08.800
So if we deploy a Managed Microsoft AD in the Cloud
125

125

00:05:08.800  -->  00:05:11.470
we can use it seamlessly integrated
126

126

00:05:11.470  -->  00:05:15.470
with RDS for SQL Server, workspaces, Quick sites.
127

127

00:05:15.470  -->  00:05:18.340
And we can even create SSO to provide access
128

128

00:05:18.340  -->  00:05:19.590
to third party applications
129

129

00:05:19.590  -->  00:05:20.980
and have another diagram showing you this
130

130

00:05:20.980  -->  00:05:22.450
in a second.
131

131

00:05:22.450  -->  00:05:25.920
This directory, so the Managed Microsoft AD
132

132

00:05:25.920  -->  00:05:28.250
can be a standalone repository in AWS,
133

133

00:05:28.250  -->  00:05:30.670
or it can be joined to your on-premise AD
134

134

00:05:30.670  -->  00:05:32.720
and we'll see how to join it in a second.
135

135

00:05:33.850  -->  00:05:38.130
The Multi AZ deployment is going to be 2AZ at minimum
136

136

00:05:38.130  -->  00:05:40.430
but in case you want to increase your scaling
137

137

00:05:40.430  -->  00:05:41.610
and your availability
138

138

00:05:41.610  -->  00:05:44.500
you are able to add more Domain Controllers.
139

139

00:05:44.500  -->  00:05:46.980
So in this example, I'm adding two more Domain Controllers,
140

140

00:05:46.980  -->  00:05:51.240
that's 4 AD DC and we have increased availability.
141

141

00:05:51.240  -->  00:05:55.210
Finally, this looks like RDS for Microsoft AD.
142

142

00:05:55.210  -->  00:05:58.140
So you have automated backups if you need to.
143

143

00:05:58.140  -->  00:05:59.420
And another last feature is
144

144

00:05:59.420  -->  00:06:01.750
that you get Automated Multi-Region replication
145

145

00:06:01.750  -->  00:06:04.010
of your directory, if you need to.
146

146

00:06:04.010  -->  00:06:06.860
Now, let's have a look at the integrations in depth.
147

147

00:06:06.860  -->  00:06:10.140
So your managed Microsoft AA DC is in the middle
148

148

00:06:10.140  -->  00:06:12.160
and it can get integrated
149

149

00:06:12.160  -->  00:06:15.100
with your on-premise active directory
150

150

00:06:15.100  -->  00:06:17.730
using something called two-way Forest trust
151

151

00:06:17.730  -->  00:06:20.090
and we'll see this in a second in the next slide.
152

152

00:06:20.090  -->  00:06:22.640
It can also integrate with a bunch of database services.
153

153

00:06:22.640  -->  00:06:25.657
So most importantly is RDS for SQL server,
154

154

00:06:25.657  -->  00:06:28.330
Amazon Workspaces, Quick sites, Connect,
155

155

00:06:28.330  -->  00:06:30.620
WorkDocs and Single-Sign On.
156

156

00:06:30.620  -->  00:06:32.890
And with Single-Sign On that we'll see in the future lecture
157

157

00:06:32.890  -->  00:06:37.370
we have access to more SAML business applications
158

158

00:06:37.370  -->  00:06:42.370
such as GitHub, Box, Dropbox, Office 365 and so on.
159

159

00:06:42.460  -->  00:06:46.060
Finally, your traditional active directory applications
160

160

00:06:46.060  -->  00:06:48.220
such as your dot NET Apps, your SharePoint
161

161

00:06:48.220  -->  00:06:49.710
and your SQL server that you deploy
162

162

00:06:49.710  -->  00:06:52.660
on EC2 instances can obviously be integrated
163

163

00:06:52.660  -->  00:06:56.240
with that active directory that's managed by AWS.
164

164

00:06:56.240  -->  00:06:58.000
So, what do you remember out of it?
165

165

00:06:58.000  -->  00:07:00.830
That is the going to be the most integrated
166

166

00:07:00.830  -->  00:07:04.130
with AWS offering from directory services.
167

167

00:07:04.130  -->  00:07:06.970
Now, something I want to highlight is how to connect this
168

168

00:07:06.970  -->  00:07:09.090
to your on-premise active directory
169

169

00:07:09.090  -->  00:07:11.330
because that is going to be extremely important
170

170

00:07:11.330  -->  00:07:14.460
going to the exam to understand this subtlety.
171

171

00:07:14.460  -->  00:07:17.280
So you are able to connect your on-premise AD
172

172

00:07:17.280  -->  00:07:20.240
to AWS Manage Microsoft AD.
173

173

00:07:20.240  -->  00:07:22.720
And for this, you need to set up a Direct Connect
174

174

00:07:22.720  -->  00:07:25.270
and this will going to be DX in this course
175

175

00:07:25.270  -->  00:07:27.410
or a VPN connection between the two.
176

176

00:07:27.410  -->  00:07:29.170
So we have your on-premise and your VPC
177

177

00:07:29.170  -->  00:07:31.520
and we have set up a connection between these two.
178

178

00:07:31.520  -->  00:07:33.660
And so we have our on-premise Microsoft AD
179

179

00:07:33.660  -->  00:07:35.820
which manages its own user on-premise,
180

180

00:07:35.820  -->  00:07:38.273
and you have AWS Manage Microsoft AD
181

181

00:07:38.273  -->  00:07:42.290
this going to also be managing its own users on AWS.
182

182

00:07:42.290  -->  00:07:45.900
And so you can set up three kind of forest trust.
183

183

00:07:45.900  -->  00:07:50.090
The first one is one way when we have AWS trust on-premise
184

184

00:07:50.090  -->  00:07:51.870
the second one is the other one way
185

185

00:07:51.870  -->  00:07:54.490
which you have the on-premise trust AWS.
186

186

00:07:54.490  -->  00:07:56.820
And finally you have something called two-way forest trust
187

187

00:07:56.820  -->  00:07:59.550
where they both trust each other and means
188

188

00:07:59.550  -->  00:08:02.820
that you can access one from the other and vice versa.
189

189

00:08:02.820  -->  00:08:03.960
So let's have a look
190

190

00:08:03.960  -->  00:08:06.050
we have trust this way and trust that way.
191

191

00:08:06.050  -->  00:08:08.950
And so that means that we have a two-way forest trust.
192

192

00:08:08.950  -->  00:08:11.130
And the important thing to understand here
193

193

00:08:11.130  -->  00:08:14.090
is that this forest trust is going to be different
194

194

00:08:14.090  -->  00:08:15.920
than synchronization.
195

195

00:08:15.920  -->  00:08:18.560
So, replication is not something that is supported
196

196

00:08:18.560  -->  00:08:21.000
by AWS management Microsoft AD.
197

197

00:08:21.000  -->  00:08:25.030
So that means that their users are living independently
198

198

00:08:25.030  -->  00:08:28.120
on the two different Microsoft active directory.
199

199

00:08:28.120  -->  00:08:31.190
But thanks to this forest trust, they're able to talk
200

200

00:08:31.190  -->  00:08:33.000
to each other in case one user is missing
201

201

00:08:33.000  -->  00:08:35.580
from one and ask the other DC, Hey
202

202

00:08:35.580  -->  00:08:38.300
do you think you have that user because I trust you
203

203

00:08:38.300  -->  00:08:40.690
so very important to understand the distinction.
204

204

00:08:40.690  -->  00:08:42.910
So, your traditional active directory app
205

205

00:08:42.910  -->  00:08:44.780
can connect to on-premise.
206

206

00:08:44.780  -->  00:08:47.440
Your easy to instances can do seamless domain joint
207

207

00:08:47.440  -->  00:08:49.500
onto your Microsoft Manage AD.
208

208

00:08:49.500  -->  00:08:52.610
But now, because we have set up a two-way forest trust
209

209

00:08:52.610  -->  00:08:54.990
your traditional active directory app
210

210

00:08:54.990  -->  00:08:58.100
in case it is trying to request a domain that belongs
211

211

00:08:58.100  -->  00:08:59.130
to AWS.
212

212

00:08:59.130  -->  00:08:59.963
Thanks to the trust.
213

213

00:08:59.963  -->  00:09:01.740
It's able to go all the way
214

214

00:09:01.740  -->  00:09:03.770
and check the user on the right hand side.
215

215

00:09:03.770  -->  00:09:07.530
So this is the whole idea behind two-way forest trust.
216

216

00:09:07.530  -->  00:09:09.610
You don't need to know that level of detail in the exam
217

217

00:09:09.610  -->  00:09:11.580
but hopefully that gives you a much better idea
218

218

00:09:11.580  -->  00:09:14.070
of what is a trust between your on-premise
219

219

00:09:14.070  -->  00:09:17.870
and your online on AWS Microsoft AD.
220

220

00:09:17.870  -->  00:09:20.720
So, now let's talk about a bit more solution architecture
221

221

00:09:20.720  -->  00:09:22.470
because we have to get into those
222

222

00:09:22.470  -->  00:09:23.750
and they can be quite complicated
223

223

00:09:23.750  -->  00:09:28.200
but say you want to have your Microsoft AD that's
224

224

00:09:28.200  -->  00:09:32.650
on-premise replicated on AWS for minimizing latency.
225

225

00:09:32.650  -->  00:09:34.800
So, for example, we want to say, okay
226

226

00:09:34.800  -->  00:09:39.530
we want to have our replica of the on-premise AD on AWS
227

227

00:09:39.530  -->  00:09:43.770
because if somehow the direct connect or the VPN goes down
228

228

00:09:43.770  -->  00:09:46.170
then we still want our users to have connectivity
229

229

00:09:46.170  -->  00:09:47.710
and function correctly.
230

230

00:09:47.710  -->  00:09:51.780
So we also need to be establishing trust between these ADs.
231

231

00:09:51.780  -->  00:09:53.170
So what does it look like?
232

232

00:09:53.170  -->  00:09:56.150
Well, we have our on-premise Microsoft AD with one domain
233

233

00:09:56.150  -->  00:09:59.943
and we have the VPC AWS Managed Microsoft AD DC
234

234

00:09:59.943  -->  00:10:01.780
with another domain.
235

235

00:10:01.780  -->  00:10:04.660
The only way to set up some kind of replication
236

236

00:10:04.660  -->  00:10:07.210
is for you to deploy active directory
237

237

00:10:07.210  -->  00:10:09.750
on an easy two windows instance,
238

238

00:10:09.750  -->  00:10:12.380
and you will have to set up replication.
239

239

00:10:12.380  -->  00:10:13.320
And by setting up those replication
240

240

00:10:13.320  -->  00:10:17.150
we'll have a replica on-premise Microsoft AD onto our VPC
241

241

00:10:17.150  -->  00:10:19.240
which may help minimize latency
242

242

00:10:19.240  -->  00:10:22.300
and also have a disaster recovery strategy.
243

243

00:10:22.300  -->  00:10:25.420
And finally, we can set up a two-way forest trust
244

244

00:10:25.420  -->  00:10:27.010
between our EC2 instance
245

245

00:10:27.010  -->  00:10:32.010
and our AWS Manage Microsoft AD DC in this own VPC.
246

246

00:10:32.120  -->  00:10:33.840
So this is the kind
247

247

00:10:33.840  -->  00:10:35.710
of solution architecture that will be asked
248

248

00:10:35.710  -->  00:10:36.870
from you at the exam.
249

249

00:10:36.870  -->  00:10:38.180
So that's why it's really important to
250

250

00:10:38.180  -->  00:10:39.380
get the basics done first.
251

251

00:10:39.380  -->  00:10:42.570
And then talk about these little interesting twists
252

252

00:10:42.570  -->  00:10:44.590
on solution architecture.
253

253

00:10:44.590  -->  00:10:48.720
Okay, so that's all for AWS manage Microsoft AD.
254

254

00:10:48.720  -->  00:10:51.170
Now we have AD Connector, which is much simpler.
255

255

00:10:51.170  -->  00:10:52.930
So it's going to be a gateway.
256

256

00:10:52.930  -->  00:10:54.860
So a proxy to redirect your request
257

257

00:10:54.860  -->  00:10:57.510
your on-premise Microsoft Active Directory
258

258

00:10:57.510  -->  00:11:00.420
there's no caching capability.
259

259

00:11:00.420  -->  00:11:02.540
The users are solely managed on-premise,
260

260

00:11:02.540  -->  00:11:04.120
there is no trust being set up
261

261

00:11:04.120  -->  00:11:06.200
and need to have VPN or Direct Connect.
262

262

00:11:06.200  -->  00:11:09.320
And so it doesn't have this integration with SQL server.
263

263

00:11:09.320  -->  00:11:12.160
It doesn't do seamless joining it comes share directory.
264

264

00:11:12.160  -->  00:11:14.170
So this is something a bit more basic.
265

265

00:11:14.170  -->  00:11:16.340
And hopefully the example will be very clear
266

266

00:11:16.340  -->  00:11:20.350
if you need AD connector that some kind of directory proxy
267

267

00:11:20.350  -->  00:11:23.150
but AD Connector in case the connection goes down,
268

268

00:11:23.150  -->  00:11:25.040
well, it's basically useless.
269

269

00:11:25.040  -->  00:11:26.660
So how does that work?
270

270

00:11:26.660  -->  00:11:30.590
Well, we have our corporate office and the Database Cloud
271

271

00:11:30.590  -->  00:11:32.530
and there will be a VPN or Direct Connect
272

272

00:11:32.530  -->  00:11:35.060
connection between these two,
273

273

00:11:35.060  -->  00:11:37.930
and then therefore we can have our active directory directly
274

274

00:11:37.930  -->  00:11:39.700
within our corporate office
275

275

00:11:39.700  -->  00:11:41.510
but our users who wants to again
276

276

00:11:41.510  -->  00:11:43.080
will happen to do the following flow.
277

277

00:11:43.080  -->  00:11:45.710
So first they will use the credentials
278

278

00:11:45.710  -->  00:11:47.900
onto a custom signing page.
279

279

00:11:47.900  -->  00:11:50.930
This signing page will be connected to the AD Connector
280

280

00:11:50.930  -->  00:11:52.320
which may be multi AZ.
281

281

00:11:52.320  -->  00:11:54.860
So in one AZ, the AD Connector will be used.
282

282

00:11:54.860  -->  00:11:57.910
This AD Connector then will proxy the request
283

283

00:11:57.910  -->  00:12:01.030
all the way through to the active directory
284

284

00:12:01.030  -->  00:12:01.990
on the corporate office
285

285

00:12:01.990  -->  00:12:04.220
and will perform LDAP authentication.
286

286

00:12:04.220  -->  00:12:05.330
And if this is good
287

287

00:12:05.330  -->  00:12:09.950
then the AD Connector will perform the STS assumerole IAM
288

288

00:12:09.950  -->  00:12:11.400
which will get back temporary credentials.
289

289

00:12:11.400  -->  00:12:15.157
And then our user will be authenticated into AWS.
290

290

00:12:16.680  -->  00:12:18.090
Finally, you have Simple AD
291

291

00:12:18.090  -->  00:12:20.800
which is going to be very inexpensive Active Directory
292

292

00:12:20.800  -->  00:12:23.290
and it's going to have the most common directory features.
293

293

00:12:23.290  -->  00:12:25.220
It will support joining of EC2 instances,
294

294

00:12:25.220  -->  00:12:26.800
managing users and groups,
295

295

00:12:26.800  -->  00:12:29.010
but it won't support multifactor authentication.
296

296

00:12:29.010  -->  00:12:31.730
It will not support the integration with RDS SQL server.
297

297

00:12:31.730  -->  00:12:34.040
It will not support SSO
298

298

00:12:34.040  -->  00:12:36.580
and it's only for small amount of users.
299

299

00:12:36.580  -->  00:12:39.620
So, 500 users up to maybe 5,000 users
300

300

00:12:39.620  -->  00:12:41.750
depending on the tier you want to use.
301

301

00:12:41.750  -->  00:12:43.890
It's powered by Samba 4, and it's compatible
302

302

00:12:43.890  -->  00:12:46.170
with Microsoft AD in terms of the API
303

303

00:12:46.170  -->  00:12:48.150
but it's a lower cost, low scale.
304

304

00:12:48.150  -->  00:12:51.790
It's only has basic AD capability or LDAP compatibility
305

305

00:12:51.790  -->  00:12:54.650
and you cannot set up a trust with a on-premise
306

306

00:12:54.650  -->  00:12:56.220
Microsoft AD.

307

00:12:56.220  -->  00:12:57.053
So that's it.
308

308

00:12:57.053  -->  00:12:58.530
Obviously the most important one is going to be
309

309

00:12:58.530  -->  00:12:59.830
the first one described
310

310

00:12:59.830  -->  00:13:02.900
but now you have the three options of directory services
311

311

00:13:02.900  -->  00:13:05.270
and hopefully there's a bit more clear which one to choose
312

312

00:13:05.270  -->  00:13:07.710
based on which circumstances at the exam.
313

313

00:13:07.710  -->  00:13:08.640
All right, that's it.
314

314

00:13:08.640  -->  00:13:10.390
I will see you in the next lecture.
