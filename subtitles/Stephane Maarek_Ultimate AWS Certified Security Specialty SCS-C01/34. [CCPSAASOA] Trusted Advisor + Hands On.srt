00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:03,010
<v Instructor>So now let's discuss Trusted Advisor.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,010  -->  00:00:05,270
So Trusted Advisor is a service that just runs out of the
3

3

00:00:05,270  -->  00:00:07,300
bucks. You don't need to install anything,
4

4

00:00:07,300  -->  00:00:10,750
and it gives you a high level AWS account assessments.
5

5

00:00:10,750  -->  00:00:12,700
So it will just run a bunch of checks
6

6

00:00:12,700  -->  00:00:15,310
and tell you if the checks are passing or not passing.
7

7

00:00:15,310  -->  00:00:17,287
And here's an example of the checks does, for example,
8

8

00:00:17,287  -->  00:00:20,400
Amazon EBS public snapshots, zero found,
9

9

00:00:20,400  -->  00:00:23,020
okay good. The check is passing and so on.
10

10

00:00:23,020  -->  00:00:25,020
So it's going to analyze your accounts and provide
11

11

00:00:25,020  -->  00:00:26,790
recommendations on five categories.
12

12

00:00:26,790  -->  00:00:29,380
And you need to remember these five categories so please
13

13

00:00:29,380  -->  00:00:33,810
learn them. We have cost optimization performance, security,
14

14

00:00:33,810  -->  00:00:36,370
fault tolerance and service limits.
15

15

00:00:36,370  -->  00:00:38,330
Remember these five categories because the exam
16

16

00:00:38,330  -->  00:00:39,163
will ask you,
17

17

00:00:39,163  -->  00:00:42,890
"Hey, what are two of the Trusted Advisor categories?"
18

18

00:00:42,890  -->  00:00:45,540
So remember these five so that you can identify the ones
19

19

00:00:45,540  -->  00:00:47,930
that are going to be correct in the question.
20

20

00:00:47,930  -->  00:00:50,030
The second thing that the exam will ask you on for
21

21

00:00:50,030  -->  00:00:52,970
Trusted Advisor is around the support plans.
22

22

00:00:52,970  -->  00:00:57,390
So we have by default seven core checks available to us
23

23

00:00:57,390  -->  00:01:01,640
if we are on the basic and developer support plan. So again,
24

24

00:01:01,640  -->  00:01:03,850
something to remember seven core checks on the basic
25

25

00:01:03,850  -->  00:01:05,330
and developer support plan.
26

26

00:01:05,330  -->  00:01:07,790
And you need to remember them what these core checks are,
27

27

00:01:07,790  -->  00:01:09,377
because again, the exam will ask you,
28

28

00:01:09,377  -->  00:01:12,860
"Hey, what are some of the core checks of Trusted Advisor?"
29

29

00:01:12,860  -->  00:01:14,930
So we have seven, we have S3 bucket permissions,
30

30

00:01:14,930  -->  00:01:17,740
making sure bucket is not public. Security group,
31

31

00:01:17,740  -->  00:01:20,360
making sure that some ports are not unrestricted,
32

32

00:01:20,360  -->  00:01:21,800
such as SSH.
33

33

00:01:21,800  -->  00:01:24,300
IAM Use so making sure that we have at least one,
34

34

00:01:24,300  -->  00:01:27,440
IAM user in our accounts. MFA on root accounts
35

35

00:01:27,440  -->  00:01:29,390
so making sure that we have enabled
36

36

00:01:29,390  -->  00:01:30,950
multifactor authentication
37

37

00:01:30,950  -->  00:01:32,550
for the root accounts,
38

38

00:01:32,550  -->  00:01:33,870
ensuring we don't have any EBS
39

39

00:01:33,870  -->  00:01:36,850
public snapshots, ensuring we do not have any RDS
40

40

00:01:36,850  -->  00:01:37,720
public snapshots.
41

41

00:01:37,720  -->  00:01:41,780
And finally looking at service limits in AWS.
42

42

00:01:41,780  -->  00:01:44,630
These are the seven core checks. Please remember them.
43

43

00:01:44,630  -->  00:01:46,300
And the fact that it is for the basic
44

44

00:01:46,300  -->  00:01:48,430
and developers support plan.
45

45

00:01:48,430  -->  00:01:50,570
The other thing you need to know about Trusted Advisor is
46

46

00:01:50,570  -->  00:01:51,910
around the full checks.
47

47

00:01:51,910  -->  00:01:53,980
So this is available for your business
48

48

00:01:53,980  -->  00:01:55,620
and enterprise support plan.
49

49

00:01:55,620  -->  00:01:57,480
Yet nother thing to remember.
50

50

00:01:57,480  -->  00:01:59,160
And is going to give you access to
51

51

00:01:59,160  -->  00:02:01,930
all the checks in the five categories I showed you before
52

52

00:02:01,930  -->  00:02:03,200
you can set CloudWatch alarms
53

53

00:02:03,200  -->  00:02:06,060
when reaching these limits and you have very important
54

54

00:02:06,060  -->  00:02:07,720
as well from an exam perspective,
55

55

00:02:07,720  -->  00:02:12,070
you get programmatic access using the AWS support API.
56

56

00:02:12,070  -->  00:02:15,260
You do not have access to the API if you are on the basic
57

57

00:02:15,260  -->  00:02:17,780
and developer support plan. Okay?
58

58

00:02:17,780  -->  00:02:20,663
So let's have a look at Trusted Advisor now in the console.
59

59

00:02:21,500  -->  00:02:25,020
So let me go into the Trusted Advisor service.
60

60

00:02:25,020  -->  00:02:27,940
Here we go. So currently there's zero actions,
61

61

00:02:27,940  -->  00:02:30,200
zero investigations and zero excluded items,
62

62

00:02:30,200  -->  00:02:31,470
and you can refresh all checks
63

63

00:02:31,470  -->  00:02:33,840
if you want to have a run of all the checks
64

64

00:02:33,840  -->  00:02:35,310
of Trusted Advisor.
65

65

00:02:35,310  -->  00:02:37,330
And as we can see, there's a recommended action.
66

66

00:02:37,330  -->  00:02:40,090
It says you need to upgrade your support plan to get access
67

67

00:02:40,090  -->  00:02:41,700
to all Trusted Advisor checks.
68

68

00:02:41,700  -->  00:02:44,950
Because right now I am just on the basic support plan.
69

69

00:02:44,950  -->  00:02:47,169
So let's go into cost optimization. As you can see,
70

70

00:02:47,169  -->  00:02:50,310
we have none because we don't have the support plan needed
71

71

00:02:50,310  -->  00:02:53,860
for that. Same for performance, same for security.
72

72

00:02:53,860  -->  00:02:55,340
I'm sorry, same for fault tolerance.
73

73

00:02:55,340  -->  00:02:58,640
And for security, we have access to six checks.
74

74

00:02:58,640  -->  00:03:02,850
So we have EBS public snapshots, RDS public snapshots,
75

75

00:03:02,850  -->  00:03:05,590
IAM Use, S3 bucket permissions,
76

76

00:03:05,590  -->  00:03:07,944
MFA on root accounts and security groups
77

77

00:03:07,944  -->  00:03:10,070
specific ports unrestricted.
78

78

00:03:10,070  -->  00:03:13,810
So this is six free core checks available to me.
79

79

00:03:13,810  -->  00:03:15,730
And then on service limits,
80

80

00:03:15,730  -->  00:03:18,500
we have access to a bunch of service limits in here to check
81

81

00:03:18,500  -->  00:03:20,810
for example, whether or not we're using the limits
82

82

00:03:20,810  -->  00:03:23,890
of EC2 on-demand instances and so on.
83

83

00:03:23,890  -->  00:03:24,760
And for tolerance as well
84

84

00:03:24,760  -->  00:03:26,380
we don't have access with the checks.
85

85

00:03:26,380  -->  00:03:27,310
So what I want you to see
86

86

00:03:27,310  -->  00:03:29,290
is that if you go to cost optimization,
87

87

00:03:29,290  -->  00:03:30,730
we can have a look at, for example,
88

88

00:03:30,730  -->  00:03:33,550
this is a low utilization. Amazon is two instances check,
89

89

00:03:33,550  -->  00:03:36,020
but we don't have access to this check unless we upgrade our
90

90

00:03:36,020  -->  00:03:37,550
support plan. Okay?
91

91

00:03:37,550  -->  00:03:39,140
So you've seen everything you need to see
92

92

00:03:39,140  -->  00:03:40,520
from the exam perspective.
93

93

00:03:40,520  -->  00:03:42,840
It's not very interesting to look at Trusted Advisor on
94

94

00:03:42,840  -->  00:03:44,910
the core checks when nothing's running on my accounts,
95

95

00:03:44,910  -->  00:03:48,000
obviously. But I find it very, very good, for example,
96

96

00:03:48,000  -->  00:03:50,099
to have a check for EBS public snapshots
97

97

00:03:50,099  -->  00:03:51,860
or RDS public snapshots,
98

98

00:03:51,860  -->  00:03:55,530
because this could be a data leak or your Amazon S3 bucket
99

99

00:03:55,530  -->  00:03:59,020
permissions that are too open to the public. Okay?
100

100

00:03:59,020  -->  00:04:00,180
So that's it for this lecture.
101

101

00:04:00,180  -->  00:04:02,853
I hope you liked it and it will see you in the next lecture.
