00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:02.010
<v Instructor>So let's talk about troubleshooting</v>
2

2

00:00:02.010  -->  00:00:05.371
especially when QuickSight is trying to use Athena
3

3

00:00:05.371  -->  00:00:08.220
but there are insufficient permissions.
4

4

00:00:08.220  -->  00:00:09.870
So what could be happening?
5

5

00:00:09.870  -->  00:00:12.720
Number one is that QuickSight must be able
6

6

00:00:12.720  -->  00:00:16.110
to access your S3 buckets that are used by Athena.
7

7

00:00:16.110  -->  00:00:17.640
So please make sure that QuickSight
8

8

00:00:17.640  -->  00:00:21.930
has the GetObject permission onto your S3 buckets.
9

9

00:00:21.930  -->  00:00:24.560
The second thing is that if the data in the S3 bucket
10

10

00:00:24.560  -->  00:00:27.300
is encrypted using a KMS key,
11

11

00:00:27.300  -->  00:00:30.510
so using the SSE-KMS type of encryption,
12

12

00:00:30.510  -->  00:00:33.420
then you make sure the QuickSight IAM role
13

13

00:00:33.420  -->  00:00:35.100
must be granted access
14

14

00:00:35.100  -->  00:00:39.090
to decrypt with the key, to do a kms:Decrypt.
15

15

00:00:39.090  -->  00:00:41.970
And we'll see how to create a grant
16

16

00:00:41.970  -->  00:00:44.419
when we go into the last section, the last domain,
17

17

00:00:44.419  -->  00:00:48.720
to talk about KMS, we talk about KMS grants in details.
18

18

00:00:48.720  -->  00:00:50.580
But you need to do a grant on what's called
19

19

00:00:50.580  -->  00:00:52.350
the IAM role of QuickSight
20

20

00:00:52.350  -->  00:00:55.149
to grant the role access to the underlying
21

21

00:00:55.149  -->  00:00:58.080
KMS key of the S3 buckets.
22

22

00:00:58.080  -->  00:00:59.580
And so there are two kinds of roles
23

23

00:00:59.580  -->  00:01:01.080
that QuickSight can be using.
24

24

00:01:01.080  -->  00:01:02.700
It doesn't really matter, you don't need to know them, okay?
25

25

00:01:02.700  -->  00:01:06.000
But there is a service role and there is a consumer's role.
26

26

00:01:06.000  -->  00:01:08.070
And whatever role QuickSight is using
27

27

00:01:08.070  -->  00:01:11.370
should be the one you grant access to the KMS key.
28

28

00:01:11.370  -->  00:01:12.690
And after granting access
29

29

00:01:12.690  -->  00:01:14.806
then these roles can do a kms:Decrypt
30

30

00:01:14.806  -->  00:01:16.410
and you will have solved
31

31

00:01:16.410  -->  00:01:18.608
your insufficient permissions problem
32

32

00:01:18.608  -->  00:01:21.180
between QuickSight and Athena.
33

33

00:01:21.180  -->  00:01:22.013
Okay? That's it.
34

34

00:01:22.013  -->  00:01:24.993
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
