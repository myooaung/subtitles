<v Instructor>Okay, Another short lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01,500  -->  00:00:04,710
around how to encrypt many objects at a time
3

3

00:00:04,710  -->  00:00:05,850
in the S3 bucket.
4

4

00:00:05,850  -->  00:00:08,940
To do so, we must use the S3 Batch service,
5

5

00:00:08,940  -->  00:00:12,420
which allows you to do bulk operations on existing objects
6

6

00:00:12,420  -->  00:00:15,120
such as encryption or de-encryption.
7

7

00:00:15,120  -->  00:00:17,640
And then we need to use also S3 inventory.
8

8

00:00:17,640  -->  00:00:19,110
This is going to give us a list
9

9

00:00:19,110  -->  00:00:21,300
of all the objects and their metadata,
10

10

00:00:21,300  -->  00:00:22,260
and then we can find
11

11

00:00:22,260  -->  00:00:24,750
whether or not objects are encrypted properly.
12

12

00:00:24,750  -->  00:00:27,180
And then we have S3 Select or Athena
13

13

00:00:27,180  -->  00:00:30,570
to filter or list only these un-encrypted objects.
14

14

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:32,760
So to combine it all together,
15

15

00:00:32,760  -->  00:00:35,010
using S3 Inventory we get an object list
16

16

00:00:35,010  -->  00:00:37,290
that we can filter using S3 Select.
17

17

00:00:37,290  -->  00:00:41,010
Then we have the list of all the unencrypted objects.
18

18

00:00:41,010  -->  00:00:45,240
We use S3 Batch then to reference a KMS key ID,
19

19

00:00:45,240  -->  00:00:47,760
and then we're going to process all the objects
20

20

00:00:47,760  -->  00:00:49,110
and encrypt them.
21

21

00:00:49,110  -->  00:00:51,270
Super simple, but you need to make sure
22

22

00:00:51,270  -->  00:00:53,820
that the S3 Batch operation has access
23

23

00:00:53,820  -->  00:00:56,850
to the S3 bucket and the KMS key.
24

24

00:00:56,850  -->  00:00:58,830
So that's it for this lecture, I hope you liked it.
25

25

00:00:58,830  -->  00:01:00,780
And I will see you in the next lecture.
