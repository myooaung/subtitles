00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.980
I'm so glad that you made it all the way through the end.

5
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.540
You stuck with the tutorials, it was maybe challenging and hopefully very rewarding but you made it and
5

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.900
now hopefully you've learned a lot.. so much that you can apply it at your next job and grow with your career.

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.820
And so on. Now I have a small ask before you go.
7

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.260
I would love that you could take the time to leave a review or some feedback from me.
8

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.090
Reviews and feedback really help me as a great encouragement to produce more content and hopefully know
9

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.330
how you're doing with this course.
10

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.880
But also they help other students from all around the world make the right purchasing decision when
11

12
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.480
it comes to choosing a course and assessing its quality.
12

13
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.330
So as such I would love if you could take a minute or two of your time today to leave a review for this course.
13

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.310
If you don't know how to leave a review it's super simple.
14

15
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.470
A pop-up will show up at the end of this course and will ask you for a star rating
15

16
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.620
5 being the highest rating. You can optionally leave a comment and then you can optionally answer a
16

17
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.870
few questions and when you're ready.
17

18
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.250
Just save and exit.
18

19
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.900
If you don't see the pop-up appearing next you can click on the top right corner of the course dashboard
19

20
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.390
on Udemy.com to add edit or delete a rating.

21
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.360
Finally in the last lecture of this course the bonus lecture you'll find the list of all my other courses
21

22
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.700
with coupons included in them. I want you to have access to affordable education and I want to be able
22

23
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.880
to learn the next big thing without thinking about it.
23

24
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.910
So hopefully in this list of course as you will find what you like and learn with me next.
24

25
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.300
All right.
25

26
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.960
That's it.
26

27
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.100
I will see you in the next course.
