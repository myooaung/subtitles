1

00:00:00,390  -->  00:00:01,530
<v Instructor>So here is a lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01,530  -->  00:00:04,530
that is more focused on solution architecture,
3

3

00:00:04,530  -->  00:00:08,100
and this is around DDoS protection and best practices.
4

4

00:00:08,100  -->  00:00:10,440
So let's assume that you have this kind of architecture,
5

5

00:00:10,440  -->  00:00:13,410
we have an Auto Scaling Group with EC2 instances.
6

6

00:00:13,410  -->  00:00:16,050
It's fronted by an Elastic Load Balancer,
7

7

00:00:16,050  -->  00:00:18,364
and then your load balancer can be either exposed
8

8

00:00:18,364  -->  00:00:22,050
by a global accelerator, as fixed IPs,
9

9

00:00:22,050  -->  00:00:25,140
or it can be fronted, for example, by CloudFront.
10

10

00:00:25,140  -->  00:00:28,933
CloudFront can be linked to a WAF,
11

11

00:00:28,933  -->  00:00:31,500
a Web Application Firewall, and so on.
12

12

00:00:31,500  -->  00:00:36,000
You can have Route 53 for DNS routing.
13

13

00:00:36,000  -->  00:00:38,280
And finally, you could also have another architecture
14

14

00:00:38,280  -->  00:00:41,190
where you have CloudFront and the API Gateway.
15

15

00:00:41,190  -->  00:00:42,690
So this is just to represent
16

16

00:00:42,690  -->  00:00:44,100
the kind of combinations you can do.
17

17

00:00:44,100  -->  00:00:45,750
Obviously, there are more than one.
18

18

00:00:45,750  -->  00:00:47,490
But the idea is that we're going to discuss,
19

19

00:00:47,490  -->  00:00:49,230
thanks to the letter BP1,
20

20

00:00:49,230  -->  00:00:51,510
Best Practice 1, Best Practice 2, et cetera.
21

21

00:00:51,510  -->  00:00:52,740
what the implications are
22

22

00:00:52,740  -->  00:00:55,470
in terms of DDoS resiliency, okay?
23

23

00:00:55,470  -->  00:00:59,190
So by using CloudFront, we are actually at the edge.
24

24

00:00:59,190  -->  00:01:02,250
So this slide is all about edge location mitigation.
25

25

00:01:02,250  -->  00:01:03,960
That means that your web application delivery
26

26

00:01:03,960  -->  00:01:05,100
is at the edge,
27

27

00:01:05,100  -->  00:01:06,720
and so you're going to be protected
28

28

00:01:06,720  -->  00:01:09,840
against DDoS Common Attacks by using Shield,
29

29

00:01:09,840  -->  00:01:11,850
just a normal setup of Shield,
30

30

00:01:11,850  -->  00:01:14,190
so SYN floods and UDP reflection.
31

31

00:01:14,190  -->  00:01:16,710
If you use the Global Accelerator,
32

32

00:01:16,710  -->  00:01:20,280
it's going to be able to access your application
33

33

00:01:20,280  -->  00:01:22,860
around the world, again, at the edge.
34

34

00:01:22,860  -->  00:01:24,690
And again, it's fully integrated with Shield
35

35

00:01:24,690  -->  00:01:26,280
for DDoS protection.
36

36

00:01:26,280  -->  00:01:28,740
So it's very helpful if your backend
37

37

00:01:28,740  -->  00:01:31,320
is somehow not compatible with CloudFront.
38

38

00:01:31,320  -->  00:01:34,080
In this case, you would have Global Accelerator
39

39

00:01:34,080  -->  00:01:35,010
in front of it.
40

40

00:01:35,010  -->  00:01:37,530
And so that means that no matter what backend you have,
41

41

00:01:37,530  -->  00:01:40,740
you're either using CloudFront or Global Accelerator,
42

42

00:01:40,740  -->  00:01:44,040
you will be fully distributed at the edge of AWS
43

43

00:01:44,040  -->  00:01:48,150
and the edge location will be DDoS protected.
44

44

00:01:48,150  -->  00:01:50,760
Also, if you use Route 53,
45

45

00:01:50,760  -->  00:01:53,310
then the Domain Name Resolution is global.
46

46

00:01:53,310  -->  00:01:54,270
It's at the edge,
47

47

00:01:54,270  -->  00:01:58,140
and you also have a DDoS Protection mechanism on your DNS.
48

48

00:01:58,140  -->  00:02:00,240
So we understand that if we're at the edge,
49

49

00:02:00,240  -->  00:02:02,133
we can have a better DDoS protection.
50

50

00:02:03,180  -->  00:02:07,980
Next, we can have the best practices for DDoS mitigation.
51

51

00:02:07,980  -->  00:02:10,830
So first let's look at the infrastructure layer defense.
52

52

00:02:10,830  -->  00:02:13,890
This is BP1, BP3, and BP6.
53

53

00:02:13,890  -->  00:02:17,430
So the idea is that by using CloudFront, Global Accelerator,
54

54

00:02:17,430  -->  00:02:20,460
Route 53, and the Elastic Load Balancing,
55

55

00:02:20,460  -->  00:02:24,870
we protect our Amazon EC2 instances against high traffic.
56

56

00:02:24,870  -->  00:02:28,710
And this is the idea that by using all these services,
57

57

00:02:28,710  -->  00:02:30,990
the traffic is going to be handled by most of them
58

58

00:02:30,990  -->  00:02:34,590
before ever reaching our EC2 instances.
59

59

00:02:34,590  -->  00:02:38,130
Now if we enable our EC2 instances with Auto Scaling,
60

60

00:02:38,130  -->  00:02:39,750
that means that in case the traffic
61

61

00:02:39,750  -->  00:02:42,570
does indeed reach our Auto Scaling group,
62

62

00:02:42,570  -->  00:02:44,340
we can scale automatically
63

63

00:02:44,340  -->  00:02:48,990
to accommodate for a greater load on our application.
64

64

00:02:48,990  -->  00:02:51,060
And if we use Elastic Load Balancing,
65

65

00:02:51,060  -->  00:02:54,780
then the ELB is going to automatically spread the traffic
66

66

00:02:54,780  -->  00:02:56,760
across many EC2 instances.
67

67

00:02:56,760  -->  00:02:58,470
So that means that EC2 instances
68

68

00:02:58,470  -->  00:03:03,090
will have a manageable amount of traffic onto them
69

69

00:03:03,090  -->  00:03:05,430
provided the fact that the Auto Scaling Group, of course,
70

70

00:03:05,430  -->  00:03:06,663
has scaled as well.
71

71

00:03:07,800  -->  00:03:10,170
Now at the Application Layer Defense,
72

72

00:03:10,170  -->  00:03:15,090
we can detect and filter malicious requests at BP1 and BP2.
73

73

00:03:15,090  -->  00:03:16,320
So the idea is that CloudFront
74

74

00:03:16,320  -->  00:03:18,300
is going to serve static content
75

75

00:03:18,300  -->  00:03:19,980
and serve it from edge locations,
76

76

00:03:19,980  -->  00:03:22,560
therefore protecting your backend.
77

77

00:03:22,560  -->  00:03:25,320
And then you can use WAF on top of CloudFront
78

78

00:03:25,320  -->  00:03:27,270
or your Application Load Balancers
79

79

00:03:27,270  -->  00:03:30,180
to filter and block requests based on request signatures.
80

80

00:03:30,180  -->  00:03:32,850
For example, you can block specific IPs,
81

81

00:03:32,850  -->  00:03:35,340
specific request types, and so on.
82

82

00:03:35,340  -->  00:03:37,860
And if you use the WAF rate-based rules,
83

83

00:03:37,860  -->  00:03:41,100
you can automatically block the IPs of bad actors.
84

84

00:03:41,100  -->  00:03:44,100
So you can use a bunch of managed rules on WAF
85

85

00:03:44,100  -->  00:03:48,210
to block IPs based on reputation or block anonymous IPs
86

86

00:03:48,210  -->  00:03:49,110
and so on.
87

87

00:03:49,110  -->  00:03:52,290
And using CloudFront, you can block specific geographies.
88

88

00:03:52,290  -->  00:03:55,500
The idea is that CloudFront and WAF are managed services,
89

89

00:03:55,500  -->  00:03:56,520
and so they will take care
90

90

00:03:56,520  -->  00:03:58,800
of filtering some requests for you
91

91

00:03:58,800  -->  00:04:02,280
so you can be protected against DDoS attack.
92

92

00:04:02,280  -->  00:04:04,200
And, of course, using Shield Advanced,
93

93

00:04:04,200  -->  00:04:05,820
so in case you enable it,
94

94

00:04:05,820  -->  00:04:09,360
then it will automatically create WAF rules for you
95

95

00:04:09,360  -->  00:04:11,160
to mitigate layer 7 attacks.
96

96

00:04:11,160  -->  00:04:13,740
So this is good for the Application Layer Defense,
97

97

00:04:13,740  -->  00:04:16,650
again, to protect your EC2 instances
98

98

00:04:16,650  -->  00:04:18,600
from getting any bad requests
99

99

00:04:18,600  -->  00:04:19,923
or at least minimize them.
100

100

00:04:20,760  -->  00:04:24,510
And also, how do we reduce our attack surface?
101

101

00:04:24,510  -->  00:04:26,040
So the idea with this architecture
102

102

00:04:26,040  -->  00:04:29,850
is that the backend AWS resources
103

103

00:04:29,850  -->  00:04:33,210
that are used to serve our application are hidden.
104

104

00:04:33,210  -->  00:04:36,090
So we have BP1, BP4, and BP6.
105

105

00:04:36,090  -->  00:04:38,940
So if you use CloudFront, the API Gateway,
106

106

00:04:38,940  -->  00:04:40,500
or Elastic Load Balancing,
107

107

00:04:40,500  -->  00:04:42,570
we can hide our backend resources.
108

108

00:04:42,570  -->  00:04:43,840
The attacker will never know
109

109

00:04:43,840  -->  00:04:47,880
if it's a Lambda function or EC2 instances or ECS tasks
110

110

00:04:47,880  -->  00:04:48,750
and so on,
111

111

00:04:48,750  -->  00:04:52,020
because we have used other things in front of them.
112

112

00:04:52,020  -->  00:04:54,930
Also, we can set up security groups and Network ACLs
113

113

00:04:54,930  -->  00:04:58,200
to filter traffic based on specific IPs.
114

114

00:04:58,200  -->  00:05:00,270
And Elastic IPs, if we use them,
115

115

00:05:00,270  -->  00:05:04,470
they can be protected by AWS Shield Advanced as well.
116

116

00:05:04,470  -->  00:05:06,630
And then you can protect API endpoints themselves.
117

117

00:05:06,630  -->  00:05:08,610
So if you use the API Gateway,
118

118

00:05:08,610  -->  00:05:10,320
then you can hide whatever backend it is,
119

119

00:05:10,320  -->  00:05:13,410
whether it be EC2, Lambda, or something else.
120

120

00:05:13,410  -->  00:05:15,750
And if you use the edge-optimized mode,
121

121

00:05:15,750  -->  00:05:16,800
you're already global.
122

122

00:05:16,800  -->  00:05:19,440
Otherwise, you can use CloudFront plus the regional mode
123

123

00:05:19,440  -->  00:05:22,200
which gives you more control for DDoS protection.
124

124

00:05:22,200  -->  00:05:25,230
And if you use WAF on top of the API Gateway,
125

125

00:05:25,230  -->  00:05:29,070
then you can get filtering of any HTTP request.
126

126

00:05:29,070  -->  00:05:31,530
And if you set up the API Gateway correctly,
127

127

00:05:31,530  -->  00:05:32,850
you can have burst limits,
128

128

00:05:32,850  -->  00:05:33,990
you can do headers filtering,
129

129

00:05:33,990  -->  00:05:37,110
and you can use and force API keys for your users,
130

130

00:05:37,110  -->  00:05:39,960
therefore protecting yourself from a DDoS attack.
131

131

00:05:39,960  -->  00:05:42,390
So hopefully, this kind of architecture makes sense
132

132

00:05:42,390  -->  00:05:44,100
and you understand the different ways
133

133

00:05:44,100  -->  00:05:45,540
you can protect against DDoS,
134

134

00:05:45,540  -->  00:05:48,960
because the exam will ask you to think just like that, okay?
135

135

00:05:48,960  -->  00:05:50,310
So that's it for this lecture.
136

136

00:05:50,310  -->  00:05:51,330
I hope you liked it,
137

137

00:05:51,330  -->  00:05:53,280
and I will see you in the next lecture.
