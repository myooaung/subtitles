00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:01.470
<v Instructor>So now, let's talk about</v>
2

2

00:00:01.470  -->  00:00:04.407
the AWS IAM Identity Center.
3

3

00:00:04.407  -->  00:00:06.510
And this service is the successor
4

4

00:00:06.510  -->  00:00:08.760
to something that you used to know probably
5

5

00:00:08.760  -->  00:00:12.540
which is called the AWS Single Sign-On Service.
6

6

00:00:12.540  -->  00:00:14.250
So, the idea is that it's the same service
7

7

00:00:14.250  -->  00:00:15.300
that's been renamed,
8

8

00:00:15.300  -->  00:00:16.680
and it gives you one login.
9

9

00:00:16.680  -->  00:00:18.360
Therefore, it's called single sign-on
10

10

00:00:18.360  -->  00:00:23.010
for all your AWS accounts in the AWS organizations,
11

11

00:00:23.010  -->  00:00:25.200
but also your business cloud applications.
12

12

00:00:25.200  -->  00:00:27.540
So you can connect to Salesforce, to Box,
13

13

00:00:27.540  -->  00:00:29.970
to Microsoft 365 and so on,
14

14

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:31.530
or any application you want
15

15

00:00:31.530  -->  00:00:35.730
as long as you have a SAML2.0 integration.
16

16

00:00:35.730  -->  00:00:39.090
And finally, it gives you a single login
17

17

00:00:39.090  -->  00:00:42.180
into your EC2 Windows Instances.
18

18

00:00:42.180  -->  00:00:44.310
So, one login access to everything
19

19

00:00:44.310  -->  00:00:45.630
which is really, really good.
20

20

00:00:45.630  -->  00:00:47.550
And the exam most likely will ask you
21

21

00:00:47.550  -->  00:00:51.690
about one login into multiple AWS accounts.
22

22

00:00:51.690  -->  00:00:53.130
Now, the identity provider,
23

23

00:00:53.130  -->  00:00:56.400
so where your users are stored for this login
24

24

00:00:56.400  -->  00:00:57.270
can be twofold.
25

25

00:00:57.270  -->  00:00:59.790
It could be a built-in identity store
26

26

00:00:59.790  -->  00:01:02.250
in the IAM Identity Center,
27

27

00:01:02.250  -->  00:01:05.340
or you can connect to a 3rd party identity provider.
28

28

00:01:05.340  -->  00:01:07.950
It can be Active Directory AD,
29

29

00:01:07.950  -->  00:01:10.710
or OneLogin, or Okta and so on.
30

30

00:01:10.710  -->  00:01:15.000
So, just to make it very visible and visual for you,
31

31

00:01:15.000  -->  00:01:17.730
we have the login flow such as this.
32

32

00:01:17.730  -->  00:01:20.220
You go onto the login page,
33

33

00:01:20.220  -->  00:01:22.980
you enter your username and your password,
34

34

00:01:22.980  -->  00:01:27.000
and then you go directly into the AWS IAM Identity Center.
35

35

00:01:27.000  -->  00:01:28.680
And this is actually a screenshot
36

36

00:01:28.680  -->  00:01:31.500
from my own Identity Center page.
37

37

00:01:31.500  -->  00:01:33.000
And as you can see from there,
38

38

00:01:33.000  -->  00:01:35.187
I have enabled it for my AWS account
39

39

00:01:35.187  -->  00:01:37.890
and so I can click on the account I want
40

40

00:01:37.890  -->  00:01:39.660
and connect directly for example
41

41

00:01:39.660  -->  00:01:41.730
in the management console
42

42

00:01:41.730  -->  00:01:43.080
And then if I do this,
43

43

00:01:43.080  -->  00:01:45.030
then I'm taken directly from this
44

44

00:01:45.030  -->  00:01:48.570
into the home page of your console.
45

45

00:01:48.570  -->  00:01:51.930
But I'm logged in in that specific console.
46

46

00:01:51.930  -->  00:01:54.030
So, the idea is that I don't need to know
47

47

00:01:54.030  -->  00:01:55.770
how to log in into that specific console.
48

48

00:01:55.770  -->  00:01:59.730
I can just log in into my IAM Identity Center portal.
49

49

00:01:59.730  -->  00:02:01.440
And from there, I have SSO.
50

50

00:02:01.440  -->  00:02:03.000
So, no need to enter your password
51

51

00:02:03.000  -->  00:02:04.320
once you have single sign-on
52

52

00:02:04.320  -->  00:02:07.350
have SSO access to accounts, business applications,
53

53

00:02:07.350  -->  00:02:08.790
and so on.
54

54

00:02:08.790  -->  00:02:11.970
So, if in the real world you have multiple AWS accounts,
55

55

00:02:11.970  -->  00:02:15.510
I would recommend 100% to use this service.
56

56

00:02:15.510  -->  00:02:17.700
Okay, so now let's talk about how this works.
57

57

00:02:17.700  -->  00:02:20.610
So, the browser interface is going to connect
58

58

00:02:20.610  -->  00:02:24.930
to the login page of your AWS IAM Identity Center.
59

59

00:02:24.930  -->  00:02:26.970
And then you have to integrate it as I said,
60

60

00:02:26.970  -->  00:02:28.470
with different user stores.
61

61

00:02:28.470  -->  00:02:30.270
So, it could be an Active Directory,
62

62

00:02:30.270  -->  00:02:32.610
it could be on the cloud or On-premises.
63

63

00:02:32.610  -->  00:02:34.620
And this is where you would use Active Directory
64

64

00:02:34.620  -->  00:02:36.750
to manage your users and your groups.
65

65

00:02:36.750  -->  00:02:39.420
Or you can use the IAM Identity Center.
66

66

00:02:39.420  -->  00:02:41.550
This is the built-in identity store.
67

67

00:02:41.550  -->  00:02:42.480
And this is where, for example,
68

68

00:02:42.480  -->  00:02:43.950
you would define your users and your groups
69

69

00:02:43.950  -->  00:02:46.440
as you are used to in IAM.
70

70

00:02:46.440  -->  00:02:49.290
Then you integrate Identity Center with SSO
71

71

00:02:49.290  -->  00:02:51.060
for your organization,
72

72

00:02:51.060  -->  00:02:53.130
or your Windows EC2 Instances,
73

73

00:02:53.130  -->  00:02:55.260
your Business Cloud Applications,
74

74

00:02:55.260  -->  00:02:59.070
or your custom SAML2.0 enabled applications.
75

75

00:02:59.070  -->  00:03:01.290
Again, the cool thing is that you have one login
76

76

00:03:01.290  -->  00:03:02.250
for all of this,
77

77

00:03:02.250  -->  00:03:04.650
and that simplifies a lot your flow.
78

78

00:03:04.650  -->  00:03:05.610
Now, of course, when you log in,
79

79

00:03:05.610  -->  00:03:07.260
you don't have access to everything.
80

80

00:03:07.260  -->  00:03:09.630
You define something called permission sets
81

81

00:03:09.630  -->  00:03:13.050
in the Identity Center to define which users
82

82

00:03:13.050  -->  00:03:15.300
have access to what.
83

83

00:03:15.300  -->  00:03:18.750
So, how does everything relate in IAM Identity Center
84

84

00:03:18.750  -->  00:03:21.120
for permissions, and users, and groups?
85

85

00:03:21.120  -->  00:03:22.350
So, we have an organization
86

86

00:03:22.350  -->  00:03:24.390
and we set up IAM Identity Center
87

87

00:03:24.390  -->  00:03:25.920
in the management accounts.
88

88

00:03:25.920  -->  00:03:27.780
We have two OUs, a development,
89

89

00:03:27.780  -->  00:03:30.780
and a production OU each with our own accounts.
90

90

00:03:30.780  -->  00:03:32.520
Now, we have two developers in our company.
91

91

00:03:32.520  -->  00:03:34.170
We have Bob and Alice.
92

92

00:03:34.170  -->  00:03:36.480
So first of all, we're going to do just like we do in IAM,
93

93

00:03:36.480  -->  00:03:38.670
we're going to create a group of developers
94

94

00:03:38.670  -->  00:03:40.110
for Bob and Alice.
95

95

00:03:40.110  -->  00:03:42.000
Now, we want to make sure that Bob and Alice
96

96

00:03:42.000  -->  00:03:47.000
both have access to full access of the OU for development.
97

97

00:03:47.760  -->  00:03:50.220
So, we're going to create what's called the permission sets
98

98

00:03:50.220  -->  00:03:53.100
and we're going to allow admin access on it.
99

99

00:03:53.100  -->  00:03:55.890
And then we have to associate this permission sets
100

100

00:03:55.890  -->  00:03:57.600
with a specific OU.
101

101

00:03:57.600  -->  00:04:00.360
So, we associate the purchase with the development OU
102

102

00:04:00.360  -->  00:04:03.000
and then we assign these permission sets
103

103

00:04:03.000  -->  00:04:04.860
to our group of developers,
104

104

00:04:04.860  -->  00:04:08.310
which will allow Bob and Alice to assume a role
105

105

00:04:08.310  -->  00:04:12.120
on any development accounts that gives them full access
106

106

00:04:12.120  -->  00:04:13.320
to that account.
107

107

00:04:13.320  -->  00:04:16.050
Similarly, we could create another permission set
108

108

00:04:16.050  -->  00:04:19.110
called ReadOnlyAccess for Production OU.
109

109

00:04:19.110  -->  00:04:20.040
So, we associate it,
110

110

00:04:20.040  -->  00:04:22.320
and again, we assign these permissions
111

111

00:04:22.320  -->  00:04:24.450
with a group of developers.
112

112

00:04:24.450  -->  00:04:27.390
So, this is how you relate users to groups,
113

113

00:04:27.390  -->  00:04:31.530
to permission sets, to assignments of specific accounts
114

114

00:04:31.530  -->  00:04:33.333
on IAM Identity Center.
115

115

00:04:34.200  -->  00:04:37.140
So, now let's talk about the fine grained permissions
116

116

00:04:37.140  -->  00:04:38.490
and assignments.
117

117

00:04:38.490  -->  00:04:41.070
And the first one is Multi-Account permission.
118

118

00:04:41.070  -->  00:04:42.900
So of course, using the service,
119

119

00:04:42.900  -->  00:04:45.360
you can manage access across multiple accounts
120

120

00:04:45.360  -->  00:04:46.710
in your organization.
121

121

00:04:46.710  -->  00:04:48.300
And using permission sets,
122

122

00:04:48.300  -->  00:04:51.090
you define one or more IAM Policies
123

123

00:04:51.090  -->  00:04:52.980
that you assign to users and to groups
124

124

00:04:52.980  -->  00:04:56.610
to define what they can access in AWS.
125

125

00:04:56.610  -->  00:04:58.350
So, here is the IAM Identity Center,
126

126

00:04:58.350  -->  00:05:00.900
and it's integrated with your organization
127

127

00:05:00.900  -->  00:05:04.140
and you define a permission sets for database admins.
128

128

00:05:04.140  -->  00:05:06.330
So, it's a collection of IAM policies.
129

129

00:05:06.330  -->  00:05:07.260
And you say for example,
130

130

00:05:07.260  -->  00:05:10.980
that you have access to RDS and Aurora in your Dev account
131

131

00:05:10.980  -->  00:05:14.340
as well as RDS and Aurora in the Prod account.
132

132

00:05:14.340  -->  00:05:15.870
And this will automatically create
133

133

00:05:15.870  -->  00:05:19.230
a corresponding IAM role for your users.
134

134

00:05:19.230  -->  00:05:21.090
And therefore, when you have your database admins,
135

135

00:05:21.090  -->  00:05:22.410
it could be a group for example,
136

136

00:05:22.410  -->  00:05:23.940
and your users are in this group,
137

137

00:05:23.940  -->  00:05:27.600
you will assign it the permission sets of database admins.
138

138

00:05:27.600  -->  00:05:31.410
And whenever users log in through the IAM Identity Center
139

139

00:05:31.410  -->  00:05:33.690
and access the console of your Dev accounts
140

140

00:05:33.690  -->  00:05:34.800
or your Prod accounts,
141

141

00:05:34.800  -->  00:05:37.170
they will be automatically assuming an IAM role
142

142

00:05:37.170  -->  00:05:38.610
in that specific accounts.
143

143

00:05:38.610  -->  00:05:41.970
They will give them the permissions they're supposed to get
144

144

00:05:41.970  -->  00:05:43.530
which is pretty good.
145

145

00:05:43.530  -->  00:05:44.730
So, it works the same way.
146

146

00:05:44.730  -->  00:05:46.050
So, you have application assignments
147

147

00:05:46.050  -->  00:05:48.510
and you can define which users or groups
148

148

00:05:48.510  -->  00:05:51.030
can access which applications.
149

149

00:05:51.030  -->  00:05:52.470
And it gives them the required URL,
150

150

00:05:52.470  -->  00:05:53.640
the certificates and metadata.
151

151

00:05:53.640  -->  00:05:56.100
So all of this is supported out of the box.
152

152

00:05:56.100  -->  00:05:58.080
And something that enables
153

153

00:05:58.080  -->  00:06:01.080
is called Attribute-Based Access Control.
154

154

00:06:01.080  -->  00:06:01.913
So, the idea
155

155

00:06:01.913  -->  00:06:04.170
is that you're going to have fine-grained permissions
156

156

00:06:04.170  -->  00:06:06.000
based on the user's attributes
157

157

00:06:06.000  -->  00:06:08.330
stored in the IAM Identity Center Store.
158

158

00:06:08.330  -->  00:06:11.070
So, that means that you can have tags and so on.
159

159

00:06:11.070  -->  00:06:12.060
And using this,
160

160

00:06:12.060  -->  00:06:14.790
you can, for example assign a user to a cost center,
161

161

00:06:14.790  -->  00:06:15.840
or give them a title.
162

162

00:06:15.840  -->  00:06:18.600
So, like junior, senior, or a locale, whatever.
163

163

00:06:18.600  -->  00:06:21.330
So, don't only have access to a specific region.
164

164

00:06:21.330  -->  00:06:22.440
And the use case of this
165

165

00:06:22.440  -->  00:06:25.740
is that you actually define the IAM permission sets once,
166

166

00:06:25.740  -->  00:06:27.750
and they leverage these attributes
167

167

00:06:27.750  -->  00:06:31.820
and you only modify the access to AWS of your users
168

168

00:06:31.820  -->  00:06:32.790
on your groups,
169

169

00:06:32.790  -->  00:06:35.520
but it's just changing these underlying attributes.
170

170

00:06:35.520  -->  00:06:37.500
So, this is a use case that is advanced
171

171

00:06:37.500  -->  00:06:42.060
but that is enabled by using the AWS IAM Identity Center.
172

172

00:06:42.060  -->  00:06:43.470
So, that's it for this lecture.
173

173

00:06:43.470  -->  00:06:46.470
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
