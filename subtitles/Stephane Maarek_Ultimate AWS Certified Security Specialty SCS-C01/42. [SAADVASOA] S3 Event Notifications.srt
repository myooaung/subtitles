00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,280
<v Tutor>So now let's talk about S3 Event Notifications.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,280  -->  00:00:04,950
And the idea is that your events
3

3

00:00:04,950  -->  00:00:07,280
are going to happen in Amazon S3.
4

4

00:00:07,280  -->  00:00:08,260
What are events?
5

5

00:00:08,260  -->  00:00:12,110
Well, events are things such as an object is created
6

6

00:00:12,110  -->  00:00:15,470
or an object is removed or an object is restored,
7

7

00:00:15,470  -->  00:00:17,800
or there is replication happening.
8

8

00:00:17,800  -->  00:00:19,150
And you can filter these events.
9

9

00:00:19,150  -->  00:00:22,070
So you can say I only wanna consider the objects
10

10

00:00:22,070  -->  00:00:23,820
that end with JPEG.
11

11

00:00:23,820  -->  00:00:26,620
So the use case for event notification would be for example,
12

12

00:00:26,620  -->  00:00:28,930
to automatically react to certain events
13

13

00:00:28,930  -->  00:00:30,570
happening in Amazon S3.
14

14

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:32,860
For example, you want to generate thumbnails
15

15

00:00:32,860  -->  00:00:36,150
of all the images upload to Amazon S3.
16

16

00:00:36,150  -->  00:00:39,020
Therefore you're going to create your event notification
17

17

00:00:39,020  -->  00:00:41,460
and then you can send it to a couple of destination.
18

18

00:00:41,460  -->  00:00:43,330
It could be an SNS topic,
19

19

00:00:43,330  -->  00:00:46,920
it could be an SQSQ, and a Lambda function.
20

20

00:00:46,920  -->  00:00:48,850
And don't worry if you don't know this by now.
21

21

00:00:48,850  -->  00:00:52,420
We will learn about these features in the next lectures.
22

22

00:00:52,420  -->  00:00:55,760
So you can create as many S3 events as desired
23

23

00:00:55,760  -->  00:00:59,010
and you can send them to whatever target you want.
24

24

00:00:59,010  -->  00:01:02,410
So the idea is that these events are typically delivered
25

25

00:01:02,410  -->  00:01:04,430
within seconds to these destinations
26

26

00:01:04,430  -->  00:01:07,350
but sometimes it can take a minute or longer.
27

27

00:01:07,350  -->  00:01:10,490
And those are the main three destinations yet to remember.
28

28

00:01:10,490  -->  00:01:13,370
But now there is a fourth one, and this is a new feature
29

29

00:01:13,370  -->  00:01:16,290
of S3 event notifications that has an integration
30

30

00:01:16,290  -->  00:01:18,350
with Amazon EventBridge.
31

31

00:01:18,350  -->  00:01:20,840
So your events are going into your Amazon S3 buckets
32

32

00:01:20,840  -->  00:01:24,100
and all the events end up in Amazon EventBridge,
33

33

00:01:24,100  -->  00:01:24,933
no matter what.
34

34

00:01:24,933  -->  00:01:26,310
So all of them, okay?
35

35

00:01:26,310  -->  00:01:29,120
And then from EventBridge that you don't know yet,
36

36

00:01:29,120  -->  00:01:31,900
but you can set up rules and from EventBridge you can,
37

37

00:01:31,900  -->  00:01:33,890
thanks to these rules, send these events
38

38

00:01:33,890  -->  00:01:38,130
to over 18 different AWS services as destinations.
39

39

00:01:38,130  -->  00:01:40,540
So it really enhances the capability
40

40

00:01:40,540  -->  00:01:42,700
of S3 event notification.
41

41

00:01:42,700  -->  00:01:45,370
And again, we'll see EventBridge later on this course.
42

42

00:01:45,370  -->  00:01:46,770
But with EventBridge,
43

43

00:01:46,770  -->  00:01:48,760
you get advanced filtering options
44

44

00:01:48,760  -->  00:01:50,820
a lot more than what we had from before.
45

45

00:01:50,820  -->  00:01:53,700
So you can filter by metadata, object size and name.
46

46

00:01:53,700  -->  00:01:55,710
You can send to multiple destinations at a time.
47

47

00:01:55,710  -->  00:01:57,590
You can set, for example, to step functions,
48

48

00:01:57,590  -->  00:01:59,400
you can see data streams or fire hoses,
49

49

00:01:59,400  -->  00:02:01,600
or you even get the features coming
50

50

00:02:01,600  -->  00:02:03,210
straight from Amazon EventBridge.
51

51

00:02:03,210  -->  00:02:05,600
So you can archive events, replay events,
52

52

00:02:05,600  -->  00:02:08,270
and you get more reliable delivery.
53

53

00:02:08,270  -->  00:02:11,700
Okay, there's a lot don't know in this lecture
54

54

00:02:11,700  -->  00:02:13,050
around the new services
55

55

00:02:13,050  -->  00:02:16,430
but let's just focus on Amazon S3 event notifications.
56

56

00:02:16,430  -->  00:02:18,890
The idea is that you can react to events
57

57

00:02:18,890  -->  00:02:20,770
happening in Amazon S3.
58

58

00:02:20,770  -->  00:02:23,820
Thanks to sending it to SQS, SNS, Lambda
59

59

00:02:23,820  -->  00:02:25,550
or Amazon EventBridge.
60

60

00:02:25,550  -->  00:02:26,383
Okay, that's it.
61

61

00:02:26,383  -->  00:02:28,000
I will see you in the next lecture.
