00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:01,980
<v Instructor>So here is a quick lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01,980  -->  00:00:04,830
on EC2 Image Builder troubleshooting.
3

3

00:00:04,830  -->  00:00:07,110
So in case you have a EC2 Image Builder
4

4

00:00:07,110  -->  00:00:11,700
but then you get Access Denied Status 403 on an S3 bucket,
5

5

00:00:11,700  -->  00:00:14,550
then the reasons may be that the Instance Profile attached
6

6

00:00:14,550  -->  00:00:17,070
to your EC2 Image Builder doesn't have
7

7

00:00:17,070  -->  00:00:20,700
the required permission or that it's missing the permissions
8

8

00:00:20,700  -->  00:00:23,850
to actually perform logging into Amazon S3.
9

9

00:00:23,850  -->  00:00:24,990
So the resolution of this
10

10

00:00:24,990  -->  00:00:27,510
is to make sure you have the proper IAM role
11

11

00:00:27,510  -->  00:00:29,430
and you have some managed policies
12

12

00:00:29,430  -->  00:00:32,070
that you can come up within IAM,
13

13

00:00:32,070  -->  00:00:35,610
such as the Amazon SSM Manage Instance Core,
14

14

00:00:35,610  -->  00:00:38,880
the EC2 Instance Profile for Image Builder,
15

15

00:00:38,880  -->  00:00:41,490
and the one that's the EC2 instance profile
16

16

00:00:41,490  -->  00:00:44,160
for Image Builder with ECR Container Builds
17

17

00:00:44,160  -->  00:00:47,640
in case you decide to create containers.
18

18

00:00:47,640  -->  00:00:49,170
Then you can also make sure
19

19

00:00:49,170  -->  00:00:52,260
that you can add a policy to your Instance Profile Role
20

20

00:00:52,260  -->  00:00:54,450
that grants put object permissions to write
21

21

00:00:54,450  -->  00:00:57,000
to your S3 bucket because this is where all the logs
22

22

00:00:57,000  -->  00:00:59,280
are going to be included and that's necessary
23

23

00:00:59,280  -->  00:01:02,100
for EC2 Image Builder to work properly.
24

24

00:01:02,100  -->  00:01:03,480
Okay, that's it for this lecture.
25

25

00:01:03,480  -->  00:01:06,573
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
