00:00:00.240  -->  00:00:01.500
<v Instructor>Another very short lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01.500  -->  00:00:04.980
on the Block Public Access settings for your buckets.
3

3

00:00:04.980  -->  00:00:05.910
So when you create a bucket,
4

4

00:00:05.910  -->  00:00:08.850
you will see these on and off type of setting.
5

5

00:00:08.850  -->  00:00:11.130
And these settings really basically block
6

6

00:00:11.130  -->  00:00:12.840
public access for your buckets.
7

7

00:00:12.840  -->  00:00:15.480
And so it turns out a lot of different processes
8

8

00:00:15.480  -->  00:00:18.330
that will allow you to make your buckets public.
9

9

00:00:18.330  -->  00:00:22.860
So this was created in order to prevent company data leaks,
10

10

00:00:22.860  -->  00:00:26.130
because while companies used to set their buckets as public
11

11

00:00:26.130  -->  00:00:29.160
and now we have restrictions that if you know
12

12

00:00:29.160  -->  00:00:31.410
that your bucket should never be public no matter what,
13

13

00:00:31.410  -->  00:00:34.350
we'll leave these on, and even if you set a bucket policy
14

14

00:00:34.350  -->  00:00:35.700
that allows your bucket to be public,
15

15

00:00:35.700  -->  00:00:37.470
it's going to be blocked.
16

16

00:00:37.470  -->  00:00:40.170
On top of it, you can set this on the bucket level,
17

17

00:00:40.170  -->  00:00:42.210
but you can also add on the account level
18

18

00:00:42.210  -->  00:00:43.800
to really make sure that all your buckets
19

19

00:00:43.800  -->  00:00:46.260
within your accounts can never be made public,
20

20

00:00:46.260  -->  00:00:50.640
and that is a good enough setting for 99% of the cases.
21

21

00:00:50.640  -->  00:00:51.473
Alright, that's it.
22

22

00:00:51.473  -->  00:00:54.400
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
