<v Instructor>Just a short lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01,350  -->  00:00:03,570
around CloudFront's geo restriction.
3

3

00:00:03,570  -->  00:00:06,240
So you can restrict who can access your distribution
4

4

00:00:06,240  -->  00:00:08,280
based on the country where they try
5

5

00:00:08,280  -->  00:00:10,170
to access the distribution from.
6

6

00:00:10,170  -->  00:00:12,450
So you can set up an allow list to define
7

7

00:00:12,450  -->  00:00:16,920
a list of approved countries or you can set up a block list
8

8

00:00:16,920  -->  00:00:19,980
to set up a list of banned countries.
9

9

00:00:19,980  -->  00:00:21,720
Now, the country is determined
10

10

00:00:21,720  -->  00:00:23,790
by using a third party geo-IP database
11

11

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:27,600
to match the IP of the user to the country it belongs to.
12

12

00:00:27,600  -->  00:00:29,940
So the use case for using geo restriction
13

13

00:00:29,940  -->  00:00:33,990
would be copyright laws to control access to content.
14

14

00:00:33,990  -->  00:00:36,870
So if we have a look in the geographic restriction
15

15

00:00:36,870  -->  00:00:39,000
in CloudFront, you can edit them
16

16

00:00:39,000  -->  00:00:41,700
and you can set up an allow list or a block list,
17

17

00:00:41,700  -->  00:00:46,410
and then say for example that only people from United States
18

18

00:00:46,410  -->  00:00:50,970
and then India are allowed in my distribution,
19

19

00:00:50,970  -->  00:00:53,790
and else not, and then you save the changes.
20

20

00:00:53,790  -->  00:00:55,020
So that's it for this lecture.
21

21

00:00:55,020  -->  00:00:57,970
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
