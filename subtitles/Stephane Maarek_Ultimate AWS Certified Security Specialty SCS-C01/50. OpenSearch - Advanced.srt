00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:02,850
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about OpenSearch security.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,850  -->  00:00:03,990
We have two deployment modes
3

3

00:00:03,990  -->  00:00:06,330
and the first one is public access,
4

4

00:00:06,330  -->  00:00:08,760
so this makes your OpenSearch cluster accessible
5

5

00:00:08,760  -->  00:00:11,640
from the internet with a public endpoint.
6

6

00:00:11,640  -->  00:00:13,200
So that means you can restrict access
7

7

00:00:13,200  -->  00:00:15,780
to OpenSearch using access policies
8

8

00:00:15,780  -->  00:00:20,550
identity-based policies, and IP-based policies.
9

9

00:00:20,550  -->  00:00:25,140
So this is a kind of diagram of the authorization flow.
10

10

00:00:25,140  -->  00:00:27,480
So the client will send a public request
11

11

00:00:27,480  -->  00:00:29,790
with HTTP basic credentials.
12

12

00:00:29,790  -->  00:00:31,710
They will check whether or not
13

13

00:00:31,710  -->  00:00:34,380
we require IAM signing of these credentials.
14

14

00:00:34,380  -->  00:00:36,450
Then the signing, the credentials themselves
15

15

00:00:36,450  -->  00:00:39,450
are going to be verified whether or not they're valid.
16

16

00:00:39,450  -->  00:00:42,600
And then if true, then the fine-grained access control
17

17

00:00:42,600  -->  00:00:44,640
will see if the user is allowed
18

18

00:00:44,640  -->  00:00:46,410
to perform the action or not.
19

19

00:00:46,410  -->  00:00:48,660
And then OpenSearch will actually return full
20

20

00:00:48,660  -->  00:00:50,250
or partial data.
21

21

00:00:50,250  -->  00:00:52,770
So what you have to remember out of public access
22

22

00:00:52,770  -->  00:00:55,260
is that if you want to restrict by IP, for example,
23

23

00:00:55,260  -->  00:00:57,753
this is based on public IP, of course.
24

24

00:00:58,710  -->  00:01:01,980
For VPC access, we need to specify the VPC,
25

25

00:01:01,980  -->  00:01:04,590
the subnets, security groups, and IAM role
26

26

00:01:04,590  -->  00:01:08,280
into which we deploy our OpenSearch cluster,
27

27

00:01:08,280  -->  00:01:11,460
we need to define VPC endpoints, absolutely,
28

28

00:01:11,460  -->  00:01:14,280
and ENIs will be created.
29

29

00:01:14,280  -->  00:01:17,010
And because now your OpenSearch cluster is deployed
30

30

00:01:17,010  -->  00:01:19,590
within your VPC, if you wanted to access it
31

31

00:01:19,590  -->  00:01:21,540
from within your own machine,
32

32

00:01:21,540  -->  00:01:24,960
you will need to be connected to the local network of AWS,
33

33

00:01:24,960  -->  00:01:28,350
so either using a VPN or transit gateway or managed network
34

34

00:01:28,350  -->  00:01:31,830
or a side-to-side VPN or proxy server, whatever you want,
35

35

00:01:31,830  -->  00:01:34,800
but you would need to be connected through the VPC.
36

36

00:01:34,800  -->  00:01:38,064
You can then restrict the VPC access using access policies
37

37

00:01:38,064  -->  00:01:40,260
and identity-based policies
38

38

00:01:40,260  -->  00:01:42,300
and as well your security groups.
39

39

00:01:42,300  -->  00:01:44,310
So the authorization flow is a little bit
40

40

00:01:44,310  -->  00:01:45,720
more complicated here,
41

41

00:01:45,720  -->  00:01:48,780
but the client will be using IAM credentials
42

42

00:01:48,780  -->  00:01:50,880
to connect to OpenSearch,
43

43

00:01:50,880  -->  00:01:52,890
so whether or not it will connect
44

44

00:01:52,890  -->  00:01:55,890
to the VPC first and then go through the security group,
45

45

00:01:55,890  -->  00:01:59,070
so is everything authorized true, true perfect?
46

46

00:01:59,070  -->  00:02:00,750
Then we'll check whether or not
47

47

00:02:00,750  -->  00:02:02,670
the IAM credentials are valid
48

48

00:02:02,670  -->  00:02:05,130
and then whether or not the access policy
49

49

00:02:05,130  -->  00:02:08,190
allows the client to access our OpenSearch cluster.
50

50

00:02:08,190  -->  00:02:11,100
Then the fine-grained access control will take action
51

51

00:02:11,100  -->  00:02:13,260
and then finally, OpenSearch will return
52

52

00:02:13,260  -->  00:02:15,450
the full or partial data.
53

53

00:02:15,450  -->  00:02:17,880
So what are these policies that we can create?
54

54

00:02:17,880  -->  00:02:20,550
Well, we have something called the domain access policy
55

55

00:02:20,550  -->  00:02:23,070
which we're going to specify only in VPC
56

56

00:02:23,070  -->  00:02:25,200
which actions the principal can can perform
57

57

00:02:25,200  -->  00:02:27,720
on the domain sub-resources,
58

58

00:02:27,720  -->  00:02:30,690
so the indexes or the specific APIs.
59

59

00:02:30,690  -->  00:02:34,440
For example, this policy grants the IAM user full access
60

60

00:02:34,440  -->  00:02:37,500
on all the OpenSearch domain sub-resources
61

61

00:02:37,500  -->  00:02:41,550
because we have action es star for a specific principal
62

62

00:02:41,550  -->  00:02:44,610
for a user on the domain test domain,
63

63

00:02:44,610  -->  00:02:48,210
which is our test domain for OpenSearch slash star,
64

64

00:02:48,210  -->  00:02:50,190
so any resources there.
65

65

00:02:50,190  -->  00:02:54,570
And this policy right here only allows HTTP GET
66

66

00:02:54,570  -->  00:02:59,370
and HTTP PUT on the commerce data within the test domain.
67

67

00:02:59,370  -->  00:03:01,590
So we can go very fine grained
68

68

00:03:01,590  -->  00:03:03,930
based on the domain access policy
69

69

00:03:03,930  -->  00:03:07,200
and that's how you manage security in OpenSearch.
70

70

00:03:07,200  -->  00:03:09,210
All right, that's it, I hope you liked it
71

71

00:03:09,210  -->  00:03:11,160
and I will see you in the next lecture.
