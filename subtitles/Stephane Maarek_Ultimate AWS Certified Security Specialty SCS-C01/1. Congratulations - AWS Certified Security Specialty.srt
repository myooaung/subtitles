2

00:00:03,060  -->  00:00:04,740
I'm super happy for you.
3

3

00:00:04,740  -->  00:00:07,500
I'm so glad you went all the way through with it.
4

4

00:00:07,500  -->  00:00:10,620
I hope that you will pass the exam without a hitch,
5

5

00:00:10,620  -->  00:00:13,110
but again, I'm pretty sure that if you follow this course
6

6

00:00:13,110  -->  00:00:14,100
with attention,
7

7

00:00:14,100  -->  00:00:16,050
and you will practice with the practice exams,
8

8

00:00:16,050  -->  00:00:17,340
you should be good to go.
9

9

00:00:17,340  -->  00:00:20,220
If you haven't done so yet, I would love a review from you.
10

10

00:00:20,220  -->  00:00:22,410
They help future students find the course,
11

11

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:24,420
and they'll help me get popular
12

12

00:00:24,420  -->  00:00:26,430
in this topic and help people.
13

13

00:00:26,430  -->  00:00:29,670
If you passed, I would love to know that you passed as well.
14

14

00:00:29,670  -->  00:00:33,060
So post it in the Q&amp;A to help motivate other students,
15

15

00:00:33,060  -->  00:00:36,840
share your tips, or post it on LinkedIn and tag me,
16

16

00:00:36,840  -->  00:00:40,123
and I'll do my best to say congratulations to you.
17

17

00:00:40,123  -->  00:00:42,150
Overall, I hope that you learned
18

18

00:00:42,150  -->  00:00:44,490
how to use AWS security in-depth
19

19

00:00:44,490  -->  00:00:47,700
and that you will be a tremendous Security Specialist.
20

20

00:00:47,700  -->  00:00:50,130
It is really a fascinating topic,
21

21

00:00:50,130  -->  00:00:52,830
and something that can really differentiate you
22

22

00:00:52,830  -->  00:00:55,470
in the job market on AWS.
23

23

00:00:55,470  -->  00:00:56,610
Okay, that's it from me.
24

24

00:00:56,610  -->  00:00:59,973
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next course.
