00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:01.530
<v Instructor>So let's see, the first service</v>
2

2

00:00:01.530  -->  00:00:03.540
that will allow us to be more elastic
3

3

00:00:03.540  -->  00:00:07.200
on AWS, this is called elastic load balancing.
4

4

00:00:07.200  -->  00:00:10.380
So a load balancer is a server that will forward
5

5

00:00:10.380  -->  00:00:14.070
the internet traffic down to multiple servers downstream.
6

6

00:00:14.070  -->  00:00:16.740
And for then there will be EC2 instances.
7

7

00:00:16.740  -->  00:00:19.560
They're also called the backend EC2 instances.
8

8

00:00:19.560  -->  00:00:21.570
So elastic load balancing is something
9

9

00:00:21.570  -->  00:00:23.580
that is managed by AWS.
10

10

00:00:23.580  -->  00:00:24.750
So we have a load balancer
11

11

00:00:24.750  -->  00:00:28.950
and this is what we will be publicly exposing for our users.
12

12

00:00:28.950  -->  00:00:30.930
And behind that load balancer,
13

13

00:00:30.930  -->  00:00:33.600
we will have multiple EC2 instances,
14

14

00:00:33.600  -->  00:00:35.580
maybe three in that case.
15

15

00:00:35.580  -->  00:00:38.490
And then we have our first user talking
16

16

00:00:38.490  -->  00:00:40.560
to our load balancer, okay?
17

17

00:00:40.560  -->  00:00:43.500
And the load balancer will be directing the traffic
18

18

00:00:43.500  -->  00:00:46.110
to one of these EC2 instances.
19

19

00:00:46.110  -->  00:00:48.030
And the EC2 instance will reply back
20

20

00:00:48.030  -->  00:00:51.120
with something and the user will get the response.
21

21

00:00:51.120  -->  00:00:53.460
But now if a second user comes in,
22

22

00:00:53.460  -->  00:00:57.660
then they will get the reply from another EC2 instance.
23

23

00:00:57.660  -->  00:00:59.100
And if a third user comes in
24

24

00:00:59.100  -->  00:01:01.290
as you can expect, it will be replying
25

25

00:01:01.290  -->  00:01:02.850
from another EC2 instance.
26

26

00:01:02.850  -->  00:01:05.490
And so the load balancer, the more users we have,
27

27

00:01:05.490  -->  00:01:07.080
the more it will balance the load
28

28

00:01:07.080  -->  00:01:09.390
across multiple EC2 instances
29

29

00:01:09.390  -->  00:01:13.110
and that will allow us to scale better our backend.
30

30

00:01:13.110  -->  00:01:14.280
So why would you use one?
31

31

00:01:14.280  -->  00:01:15.300
I think it's clear.
32

32

00:01:15.300  -->  00:01:16.620
You can spread the load
33

33

00:01:16.620  -->  00:01:19.080
across multiple downstream instances.
34

34

00:01:19.080  -->  00:01:21.300
You can expose a single point of access,
35

35

00:01:21.300  -->  00:01:24.300
DNS host name, for your application.
36

36

00:01:24.300  -->  00:01:26.040
You can seamlessly handle the failures
37

37

00:01:26.040  -->  00:01:27.270
of downstream instances.
38

38

00:01:27.270  -->  00:01:29.310
So we do regular health checks
39

39

00:01:29.310  -->  00:01:31.860
on them and if one of them is failing,
40

40

00:01:31.860  -->  00:01:33.870
then the load balancer will not direct
41

41

00:01:33.870  -->  00:01:35.400
traffic to that instance.
42

42

00:01:35.400  -->  00:01:37.080
So we can hide the failure
43

43

00:01:37.080  -->  00:01:39.450
of an instance using a load balancer.
44

44

00:01:39.450  -->  00:01:41.760
We can also provide SSL termination,
45

45

00:01:41.760  -->  00:01:45.300
so HTTPS for your websites very easily.
46

46

00:01:45.300  -->  00:01:47.400
And you are able to use a load balancer
47

47

00:01:47.400  -->  00:01:49.800
across multiple availability zones
48

48

00:01:49.800  -->  00:01:53.550
which was making your application highly available.
49

49

00:01:53.550  -->  00:01:55.020
Okay, let's keep on going.
50

50

00:01:55.020  -->  00:01:57.660
So the ELB is a manager load balancer,
51

51

00:01:57.660  -->  00:02:00.150
so you don't need to be provisioning servers.
52

52

00:02:00.150  -->  00:02:01.470
AWS will do it for you
53

53

00:02:01.470  -->  00:02:04.462
and AWS will guarantee that it will be working.
54

54

00:02:04.462  -->  00:02:07.590
AWS will take care of all the upgrades, maintenance,
55

55

00:02:07.590  -->  00:02:11.250
and high availability of that elastic load balancer.
56

56

00:02:11.250  -->  00:02:13.620
And the only thing we have to do is to configure
57

57

00:02:13.620  -->  00:02:17.580
a few things for the behavior of that load balancer.
58

58

00:02:17.580  -->  00:02:19.590
It's obviously less expensive
59

59

00:02:19.590  -->  00:02:22.890
if you want to set up your own load balancer on EC2.
60

60

00:02:22.890  -->  00:02:25.470
It is definitely possible, but in the end,
61

61

00:02:25.470  -->  00:02:27.660
there will be a lot more effort on your end
62

62

00:02:27.660  -->  00:02:31.290
for maintenance, integration, maintaining and taking care
63

63

00:02:31.290  -->  00:02:35.130
of the operating system, upgrades, et cetera, et cetera.
64

64

00:02:35.130  -->  00:02:38.370
So there are four kinds of load balancers offered
65

65

00:02:38.370  -->  00:02:41.370
by AWS and I need you to know the differences between them.
66

66

00:02:41.370  -->  00:02:44.310
So the first one is the application load balancer,
67

67

00:02:44.310  -->  00:02:48.060
which is for HTTP or HTTPS-only traffic
68

68

00:02:48.060  -->  00:02:50.280
which is called a Layer 7 type
69

69

00:02:50.280  -->  00:02:54.180
of load balancer because it's HTTP and HTTPS.
70

70

00:02:54.180  -->  00:02:56.400
Next, we have the network load balancer.
71

71

00:02:56.400  -->  00:02:58.080
It's ultra high performance.
72

72

00:02:58.080  -->  00:02:59.280
So look for that keyword.
73

73

00:02:59.280  -->  00:03:02.310
It allows for TCP and UDP actually.
74

74

00:03:02.310  -->  00:03:04.140
And it's Layer 4.
75

75

00:03:04.140  -->  00:03:08.580
So it's Layer 4 because it's lower level, so TCP and UDP.
76

76

00:03:08.580  -->  00:03:11.160
Then we have the gateway load balancer.
77

77

00:03:11.160  -->  00:03:12.030
It's Layer 3.
78

78

00:03:12.030  -->  00:03:14.670
I will show you the differences in the next slide.
79

79

00:03:14.670  -->  00:03:17.940
And then finally, we have the classic load balancer
80

80

00:03:17.940  -->  00:03:20.730
but it's being retired in 2023,
81

81

00:03:20.730  -->  00:03:23.730
so it's not going to appear at the exam anymore I feel.
82

82

00:03:23.730  -->  00:03:26.310
But if you wanna know, it was a Layer 4
83

83

00:03:26.310  -->  00:03:29.940
and Layer 7 type of load balancer of older generation.
84

84

00:03:29.940  -->  00:03:31.890
And it's been replaced by the ALB,
85

85

00:03:31.890  -->  00:03:33.510
the application balancer
86

86

00:03:33.510  -->  00:03:37.530
and the NLB, the network load balancer.
87

87

00:03:37.530  -->  00:03:41.247
So if you have a look at the differences between the ALB,
88

88

00:03:41.247  -->  00:03:46.247
the NLB, and the gateway load balancer, also GWLB,
89

89

00:03:46.620  -->  00:03:48.120
then what you'll need to look
90

90

00:03:48.120  -->  00:03:50.700
at for the exam are these kind of keywords.
91

91

00:03:50.700  -->  00:03:55.470
So if you see HTTP, HTTPS or gRPC protocol,
92

92

00:03:55.470  -->  00:03:58.530
it means it's Layer 7 and it's the ALB.
93

93

00:03:58.530  -->  00:04:01.800
Also, anytime you need HTTP routing features,
94

94

00:04:01.800  -->  00:04:03.870
this will be requested.
95

95

00:04:03.870  -->  00:04:05.940
For a static DNS as well,
96

96

00:04:05.940  -->  00:04:09.210
this would be very helpful if you wanna have a static URL.
97

97

00:04:09.210  -->  00:04:11.040
So the architecture is very simple.
98

98

00:04:11.040  -->  00:04:13.050
The users access your load balancers
99

99

00:04:13.050  -->  00:04:15.210
on one of the protocols I just mentioned
100

100

00:04:15.210  -->  00:04:17.670
and then the load balancer routes traffic
101

101

00:04:17.670  -->  00:04:20.070
to the downstream EC2 instances.
102

102

00:04:20.070  -->  00:04:21.960
For example, if you've chosen the targets
103

103

00:04:21.960  -->  00:04:24.330
to be EC2 instances.
104

104

00:04:24.330  -->  00:04:25.590
For the network load balancer,
105

105

00:04:25.590  -->  00:04:26.910
it is Layer 4.
106

106

00:04:26.910  -->  00:04:31.440
So TCP and UDP protocol, and it's very high performance.
107

107

00:04:31.440  -->  00:04:34.950
We're talking millions of requests per second.
108

108

00:04:34.950  -->  00:04:38.550
It gives you a static IP this time, so not a static URL,
109

109

00:04:38.550  -->  00:04:41.850
but a static IP through the use of elastic IP
110

110

00:04:41.850  -->  00:04:44.940
which are IPs that you own that you can move around.
111

111

00:04:44.940  -->  00:04:47.610
So this NLB gives you a static IP
112

112

00:04:47.610  -->  00:04:51.180
and the architecture is the exact same as the ALB.
113

113

00:04:51.180  -->  00:04:52.800
The traffic is being sent
114

114

00:04:52.800  -->  00:04:57.800
to the NLB on the TCP and UDP protocol, and then sent,
115

115

00:04:57.900  -->  00:05:00.180
forwarded to downstream targets.
116

116

00:05:00.180  -->  00:05:02.580
For example, E2 instances.
117

117

00:05:02.580  -->  00:05:07.350
Now, the gateway load balancer is using the GENEVE protocol
118

118

00:05:07.350  -->  00:05:09.210
on the IP packets themselves.
119

119

00:05:09.210  -->  00:05:11.040
So it's Layer 3.
120

120

00:05:11.040  -->  00:05:13.200
And the use case you need to look
121

121

00:05:13.200  -->  00:05:15.930
at for the exam is to route traffic
122

122

00:05:15.930  -->  00:05:20.250
to firewalls that you manage on EC2 instances,
123

123

00:05:20.250  -->  00:05:22.950
so that you can do, for example, classic firewall
124

124

00:05:22.950  -->  00:05:27.480
or intrusion detection or deep packet inspection.
125

125

00:05:27.480  -->  00:05:30.510
And the architecture, it is a little bit more complicated.
126

126

00:05:30.510  -->  00:05:32.760
So the gateway load balancer doesn't balance
127

127

00:05:32.760  -->  00:05:34.680
the load to your application.
128

128

00:05:34.680  -->  00:05:37.530
It actually balances the load of the traffic
129

129

00:05:37.530  -->  00:05:40.230
to the virtual appliances that you run
130

130

00:05:40.230  -->  00:05:43.770
on EC2 instances so that you can analyze the traffic
131

131

00:05:43.770  -->  00:05:45.930
or perform firewall operations.
132

132

00:05:45.930  -->  00:05:46.860
That's why it's called
133

133

00:05:46.860  -->  00:05:49.500
third-party security virtual appliances.
134

134

00:05:49.500  -->  00:05:51.300
And they can be, many of them address
135

135

00:05:51.300  -->  00:05:53.310
represented one on this diagram.
136

136

00:05:53.310  -->  00:05:55.530
And so therefore, the traffic, when it goes
137

137

00:05:55.530  -->  00:05:58.710
to the gateway load balancer, first sends the traffic
138

138

00:05:58.710  -->  00:06:02.010
to these EC2 instances that will analyze the traffic.
139

139

00:06:02.010  -->  00:06:04.410
The traffic will be sent back afterwards
140

140

00:06:04.410  -->  00:06:06.240
to the gateway load balancer
141

141

00:06:06.240  -->  00:06:08.940
and then forwarded back to the applications.
142

142

00:06:08.940  -->  00:06:11.130
So the gateway load balancer here is
143

143

00:06:11.130  -->  00:06:16.050
in the middle to allow us to inspect the IP packets themself
144

144

00:06:16.050  -->  00:06:18.150
and to perform firewall features
145

145

00:06:18.150  -->  00:06:22.080
or intrusion detection or deep packet inspection.
146

146

00:06:22.080  -->  00:06:24.900
Okay, so if you understood this, you know the differences
147

147

00:06:24.900  -->  00:06:27.480
between the load balancers and you'll be good for the exam.
148

148

00:06:27.480  -->  00:06:30.330
And I will see you in the next lecture for some practice.
