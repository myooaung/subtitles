00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,130
<v Instructor>So just a short lecture on CloudShell</v>
2

2

00:00:02,130  -->  00:00:04,200
so you know one caveat for the exam.
3

3

00:00:04,200  -->  00:00:06,750
So CloudShell is a way for you to get a terminal
4

4

00:00:06,750  -->  00:00:10,260
from within the AWS console, which is very handy.
5

5

00:00:10,260  -->  00:00:12,000
So CloudShell is a browser-based shell
6

6

00:00:12,000  -->  00:00:13,950
to manage your AWS resources
7

7

00:00:13,950  -->  00:00:16,440
and you can run CLI commands, it's pre-configured,
8

8

00:00:16,440  -->  00:00:18,750
and you can run scripts without leaving your browser.
9

9

00:00:18,750  -->  00:00:20,490
It comes pre-installed with common libraries
10

10

00:00:20,490  -->  00:00:24,630
and common CLI tools such as the AWS CLI, the ECS CLI,
11

11

00:00:24,630  -->  00:00:28,380
the SAM CLI, and SDKs for Python and Node.js.
12

12

00:00:28,380  -->  00:00:31,710
It has Bash, PowerShell, zsh, et cetera, et cetera.
13

13

00:00:31,710  -->  00:00:34,530
It comes with preconfigured AWS credentials,
14

14

00:00:34,530  -->  00:00:37,020
which are inherited from the logged in user.
15

15

00:00:37,020  -->  00:00:38,760
So as soon as you go into CloudShell,
16

16

00:00:38,760  -->  00:00:40,470
you'll have the same permissions
17

17

00:00:40,470  -->  00:00:41,970
and you have persistent storage,
18

18

00:00:41,970  -->  00:00:43,560
up to one gigabyte per region,
19

19

00:00:43,560  -->  00:00:45,540
and it runs on Amazon Linux 2.
20

20

00:00:45,540  -->  00:00:46,920
So you may say, cool, that's perfect.
21

21

00:00:46,920  -->  00:00:51,360
From CloudShell, I can 100% SSH into my EC2 instance.
22

22

00:00:51,360  -->  00:00:52,890
Well, you cannot.
23

23

00:00:52,890  -->  00:00:57,240
You cannot access resources in a VPC from CloudShell.
24

24

00:00:57,240  -->  00:01:00,090
So EC2, RDS are not accessible from CloudShell
25

25

00:01:00,090  -->  00:01:01,770
and that's what I wanted you to remember.
26

26

00:01:01,770  -->  00:01:02,910
Okay, CloudShell is great
27

27

00:01:02,910  -->  00:01:06,150
for doing API calls using the AWS CLI
28

28

00:01:06,150  -->  00:01:08,850
but you cannot access resources within the VPC.
29

29

00:01:08,850  -->  00:01:10,710
For this, you would need to have something
30

30

00:01:10,710  -->  00:01:12,540
actually within your VPC,
31

31

00:01:12,540  -->  00:01:14,850
such as an EC2 instance, and then you would use something
32

32

00:01:14,850  -->  00:01:17,040
like EC2 Instance Connect.
33

33

00:01:17,040  -->  00:01:17,940
Okay, that's it.
34

34

00:01:17,940  -->  00:01:21,123
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
