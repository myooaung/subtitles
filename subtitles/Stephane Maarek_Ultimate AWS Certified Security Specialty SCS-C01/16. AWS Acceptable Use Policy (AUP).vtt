00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.290
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about</v>
2

2

00:00:01.290  -->  00:00:05.400
the AWS Acceptable Use Policy or AUP.
3

3

00:00:05.400  -->  00:00:08.940
So this governs your use of the AWS services
4

4

00:00:08.940  -->  00:00:11.340
and there's some things you cannot do with them.
5

5

00:00:11.340  -->  00:00:12.756
So you may not use your account
6

6

00:00:12.756  -->  00:00:15.990
to do any illegal or fraudulent activity.
7

7

00:00:15.990  -->  00:00:18.630
You may not violate the rights of others.
8

8

00:00:18.630  -->  00:00:21.270
You may not threaten, perform terrorism,
9

9

00:00:21.270  -->  00:00:24.750
violence, or do any serious harm to anyone.
10

10

00:00:24.750  -->  00:00:29.359
You cannot host any child sexual abuse content or activity.
11

11

00:00:29.359  -->  00:00:31.890
You cannot violate the security, integrity,
12

12

00:00:31.890  -->  00:00:34.410
and availability for other networks and computers.
13

13

00:00:34.410  -->  00:00:36.810
for example, by performing a DDoS.
14

14

00:00:36.810  -->  00:00:38.400
You may not distribute, publish,
15

15

00:00:38.400  -->  00:00:41.280
or facilitate any unsolicited mass emails,
16

16

00:00:41.280  -->  00:00:43.680
for example, by hosting spam servers.
17

17

00:00:43.680  -->  00:00:45.545
In case that is detected,
18

18

00:00:45.545  -->  00:00:48.780
AWS is going to remove or disable any content
19

19

00:00:48.780  -->  00:00:50.370
that violates this policy.
20

20

00:00:50.370  -->  00:00:52.530
And if you wanna read more, this is the link.
21

21

00:00:52.530  -->  00:00:53.370
So that's it.
22

22

00:00:53.370  -->  00:00:54.210
I hope you liked it,
23

23

00:00:54.210  -->  00:00:56.253
and I will see you in the next lecture.
