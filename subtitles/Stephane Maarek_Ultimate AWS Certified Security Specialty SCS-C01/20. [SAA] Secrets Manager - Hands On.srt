00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:01,230
<v Instructor>So, now let's talk about</v>
2

2

00:00:01,230  -->  00:00:02,970
the Secrets Manager service.
3

3

00:00:02,970  -->  00:00:03,930
So, as we can see,
4

4

00:00:03,930  -->  00:00:07,410
it's to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve secrets
5

5

00:00:07,410  -->  00:00:09,030
throughout their life cycle.
6

6

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:11,130
So, it's similar to the SSM parameter store
7

7

00:00:11,130  -->  00:00:13,020
because you can store secret things,
8

8

00:00:13,020  -->  00:00:14,430
but it's going to be different from it
9

9

00:00:14,430  -->  00:00:17,130
because while you have rotation, management,
10

10

00:00:17,130  -->  00:00:19,470
and tight integrations with databases
11

11

00:00:19,470  -->  00:00:22,200
such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Amazon Aurora,
12

12

00:00:22,200  -->  00:00:23,850
and RDS and so on.
13

13

00:00:23,850  -->  00:00:27,660
So, the pricing is you have a 30-day free trial available,
14

14

00:00:27,660  -->  00:00:30,450
and then you're going to pay $0.40 per secret, per month,
15

15

00:00:30,450  -->  00:00:32,850
and then $0.05 per 10,000 API calls.
16

16

00:00:32,850  -->  00:00:36,150
So, if you again expect to remain within the free tier,
17

17

00:00:36,150  -->  00:00:39,030
just create a secret and then delete it.
18

18

00:00:39,030  -->  00:00:40,830
So, let's go ahead and store a new secret,
19

19

00:00:40,830  -->  00:00:42,480
and we can choose a secret type.
20

20

00:00:42,480  -->  00:00:43,313
Now, over time,
21

21

00:00:43,313  -->  00:00:45,810
it's very possible that this gets increased
22

22

00:00:45,810  -->  00:00:48,150
in terms of the capability of integrations,
23

23

00:00:48,150  -->  00:00:51,690
but we have Amazon RDS, we have Amazon DocumentDB,
24

24

00:00:51,690  -->  00:00:56,070
Amazon Redshift, other databases, or other type of secrets.
25

25

00:00:56,070  -->  00:00:59,100
So, if you are on Amazon RDS, as you can see,
26

26

00:00:59,100  -->  00:01:02,010
it prompts you for username and password and so on.
27

27

00:01:02,010  -->  00:01:02,970
And if you go for example,
28

28

00:01:02,970  -->  00:01:04,440
for other type of secrets,
29

29

00:01:04,440  -->  00:01:06,780
here we can store anything we want.
30

30

00:01:06,780  -->  00:01:09,493
So for example, I can say MySecretKey,
31

31

00:01:11,797  -->  00:01:14,837
and then MyVerySecretValue,
32

32

00:01:14,837  -->  00:01:17,850
and this would be a secret stored in here.
33

33

00:01:17,850  -->  00:01:20,760
And another one could be, for example, API_KEY,
34

34

00:01:20,760  -->  00:01:23,280
and then would be as well like a secret API key,
35

35

00:01:23,280  -->  00:01:25,590
so you would enter some text in here.
36

36

00:01:25,590  -->  00:01:27,240
So you can enter it through this UI,
37

37

00:01:27,240  -->  00:01:30,270
or you can go in plain text and you have adjacent document
38

38

00:01:30,270  -->  00:01:31,410
that you can edit it.
39

39

00:01:31,410  -->  00:01:33,240
To edit the key values,
40

40

00:01:33,240  -->  00:01:36,330
this is just a different way of specifying your secrets.
41

41

00:01:36,330  -->  00:01:39,960
So, this will be kept secret so that only person
42

42

00:01:39,960  -->  00:01:44,610
with the correct IAM permissions can access these secrets.
43

43

00:01:44,610  -->  00:01:46,290
Then we specify an encryption key.
44

44

00:01:46,290  -->  00:01:47,880
So, we have the default one,
45

45

00:01:47,880  -->  00:01:51,000
but you can use your own KMS key if you wanted to.
46

46

00:01:51,000  -->  00:01:52,320
I click on next.
47

47

00:01:52,320  -->  00:01:54,150
Then we need to name our secret.
48

48

00:01:54,150  -->  00:01:56,823
So prod/my-secret for example,
49

49

00:01:57,990  -->  00:02:00,180
and a description but I don't need it.
50

50

00:02:00,180  -->  00:02:01,013
Resource permission,
51

51

00:02:01,013  -->  00:02:02,910
so do we want to have a policy
52

52

00:02:02,910  -->  00:02:04,800
that restricts who can access the secret?
53

53

00:02:04,800  -->  00:02:06,990
And it could be across AWS accounts
54

54

00:02:06,990  -->  00:02:10,380
thanks to this resource policy right here,
55

55

00:02:10,380  -->  00:02:11,460
and you would've have it adjacent form.
56

56

00:02:11,460  -->  00:02:14,520
So, it's similar to an S3 bucket policy.
57

57

00:02:14,520  -->  00:02:16,110
And then you have the option
58

58

00:02:16,110  -->  00:02:18,702
to replicate the secret across regions.
59

59

00:02:18,702  -->  00:02:22,170
And this is good if you want to have multi-region setups
60

60

00:02:22,170  -->  00:02:25,530
which as multi-region apps or multi-region databases.
61

61

00:02:25,530  -->  00:02:26,363
And here we can say,
62

62

00:02:26,363  -->  00:02:28,050
"Okay, I want to replicate this
63

63

00:02:28,050  -->  00:02:31,530
into us-west-2 using this encryption key right here
64

64

00:02:31,530  -->  00:02:35,310
and also into AP Southeast-1 and so on.
65

65

00:02:35,310  -->  00:02:36,180
So, I'm not gonna do this,
66

66

00:02:36,180  -->  00:02:40,620
but this would be how you would replicate your secrets.
67

67

00:02:40,620  -->  00:02:43,020
So, then I click on Next.
68

68

00:02:43,020  -->  00:02:45,210
Then you want to automatically rotate our secrets,
69

69

00:02:45,210  -->  00:02:46,260
yes or no.
70

70

00:02:46,260  -->  00:02:48,120
And when do we want to rotate it,
71

71

00:02:48,120  -->  00:02:50,250
and if we do enable rotation,
72

72

00:02:50,250  -->  00:02:52,320
then we need to specify a rotation function.
73

73

00:02:52,320  -->  00:02:53,700
This is a Lambda function
74

74

00:02:53,700  -->  00:02:56,340
that will be performing this rotation.
75

75

00:02:56,340  -->  00:02:58,020
So for now, disable it.
76

76

00:02:58,020  -->  00:02:59,250
And then we have a look.
77

77

00:02:59,250  -->  00:03:00,900
So, we have a secret right here.
78

78

00:03:00,900  -->  00:03:03,870
It's replicated into us-west-2.
79

79

00:03:03,870  -->  00:03:07,020
And here's some code if we wanted to invoke
80

80

00:03:07,020  -->  00:03:09,780
and get that secrets from our clients.
81

81

00:03:09,780  -->  00:03:11,190
So, I'm not gonna go ahead with creating this,
82

82

00:03:11,190  -->  00:03:13,170
but as you can see, this would store a secret
83

83

00:03:13,170  -->  00:03:15,000
and then use this code
84

84

00:03:15,000  -->  00:03:18,120
to retrieve in your code the correct secrets.
85

85

00:03:18,120  -->  00:03:19,800
So, we'll cancel this.
86

86

00:03:19,800  -->  00:03:21,270
Another kind of secret you can have
87

87

00:03:21,270  -->  00:03:24,210
is a credential for an Amazon RDS database.
88

88

00:03:24,210  -->  00:03:27,270
So, you would create a username and a password
89

89

00:03:27,270  -->  00:03:30,120
and then you would specify a database.
90

90

00:03:30,120  -->  00:03:31,020
And the cool thing about it
91

91

00:03:31,020  -->  00:03:32,400
is that thanks to the integration
92

92

00:03:32,400  -->  00:03:34,980
between RDS and Secrets Manager,
93

93

00:03:34,980  -->  00:03:36,450
then this username and this password
94

94

00:03:36,450  -->  00:03:39,780
would be used to be able to login into the database.
95

95

00:03:39,780  -->  00:03:41,370
And if you wanted to rotate it,
96

96

00:03:41,370  -->  00:03:44,610
then automatically the database also gets updated.
97

97

00:03:44,610  -->  00:03:46,350
So, here you would enter it.
98

98

00:03:46,350  -->  00:03:47,910
Then you would configure the secrets
99

99

00:03:47,910  -->  00:03:49,320
as well if you wanted to have for example
100

100

00:03:49,320  -->  00:03:52,620
some kind of multi-region replication.
101

101

00:03:52,620  -->  00:03:56,130
Rotation as well if you wanted to review it and you're done.
102

102

00:03:56,130  -->  00:03:57,390
So, that's it for this lecture.
103

103

00:03:57,390  -->  00:04:00,390
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
