00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:00,833
<v Instructor>So now, let's talk</v>
2

2

00:00:00,833  -->  00:00:03,990
about AWS Certificate Manager or ACM.
3

3

00:00:03,990  -->  00:00:06,970
So, in case you wanna host public SSL certificates in AWS,
4

4

00:00:06,970  -->  00:00:08,370
you can have two ways.
5

5

00:00:08,370  -->  00:00:12,120
You can buy your own and upload them to ACM using the CLI,
6

6

00:00:12,120  -->  00:00:14,860
or you can have ACM provision the certificates itself,
7

7

00:00:14,860  -->  00:00:16,930
and renew it for you for free,
8

8

00:00:16,930  -->  00:00:19,130
free of cost and automatically.
9

9

00:00:19,130  -->  00:00:20,920
So, ACM will load SSL certificates
10

10

00:00:20,920  -->  00:00:23,260
onto some following integrations.
11

11

00:00:23,260  -->  00:00:24,900
Number one is load balancers,
12

12

00:00:24,900  -->  00:00:26,160
including the one you can,
13

13

00:00:26,160  -->  00:00:29,470
that you would create using Elastic Beanstalk,
14

14

00:00:29,470  -->  00:00:33,060
CloudFront distributions, APIs on API's Gateways.
15

15

00:00:33,060  -->  00:00:34,700
So, anywhere, really, there is a need
16

16

00:00:34,700  -->  00:00:35,970
for SSL certificates,
17

17

00:00:35,970  -->  00:00:39,140
there is going to be an integration with ACM for it.
18

18

00:00:39,140  -->  00:00:40,270
So, how does it work?
19

19

00:00:40,270  -->  00:00:42,317
We have our user, and he's going to talk to you
20

20

00:00:42,317  -->  00:00:44,010
in ALB for this instance,
21

21

00:00:44,010  -->  00:00:46,300
and he will go through HTTPS,
22

22

00:00:46,300  -->  00:00:48,460
and the ALB would provide SSL termination.
23

23

00:00:48,460  -->  00:00:50,370
That means that the connection will be terminated,
24

24

00:00:50,370  -->  00:00:53,530
and a new one will be opened to the backend instances.
25

25

00:00:53,530  -->  00:00:56,290
So, ACM will be on the left-hand side
26

26

00:00:56,290  -->  00:00:58,960
to provision and maintain the SSL certificates
27

27

00:00:58,960  -->  00:01:01,460
on to the ALB, so we don't have to worry
28

28

00:01:01,460  -->  00:01:03,200
about that part any more.
29

29

00:01:03,200  -->  00:01:06,480
And then, finally, the ALB will be forwarding
30

30

00:01:06,480  -->  00:01:09,490
private, HTTP requests to your EC2 instance,
31

31

00:01:09,490  -->  00:01:11,540
if you set up HTP integration,
32

32

00:01:11,540  -->  00:01:13,360
and your EC2 instance will not
33

33

00:01:13,360  -->  00:01:15,780
have to perform SSL encryption or decryption,
34

34

00:01:15,780  -->  00:01:17,660
so that means that you have less CPU cost
35

35

00:01:17,660  -->  00:01:19,060
on your EC2 instance,
36

36

00:01:19,060  -->  00:01:21,456
thanks to the SSL termination
37

37

00:01:21,456  -->  00:01:23,950
that happens at the load-balancer level.
38

38

00:01:23,950  -->  00:01:26,120
So, overall, ACM is amazing,
39

39

00:01:26,120  -->  00:01:28,040
because, from my personal experience,
40

40

00:01:28,040  -->  00:01:31,610
SSL certificates are very difficult to maintain manually,
41

41

00:01:31,610  -->  00:01:33,770
and so, having this integration with ACM,
42

42

00:01:33,770  -->  00:01:36,100
this automated provisioning, and this integration
43

43

00:01:36,100  -->  00:01:38,230
with AWS services, makes it really, really easy
44

44

00:01:38,230  -->  00:01:40,660
to deal with SSL certificates in AWS,
45

45

00:01:40,660  -->  00:01:43,560
and so, you have no reason not to use them nowadays.
46

46

00:01:43,560  -->  00:01:44,540
Okay.
47

47

00:01:44,540  -->  00:01:47,280
So, good to know going into the exam.
48

48

00:01:47,280  -->  00:01:49,417
First of all, you can create your own public certificates,
49

49

00:01:49,417  -->  00:01:52,113
and you need to verify the public DNS,
50

50

00:01:52,113  -->  00:01:53,920
and you must be issued
51

51

00:01:53,920  -->  00:01:57,020
by a trusted public certificate authority.
52

52

00:01:57,020  -->  00:01:59,050
You can create some private certificates.
53

53

00:01:59,050  -->  00:02:00,520
That's for your internal applications,
54

54

00:02:00,520  -->  00:02:02,870
so you can have your own private CA,
55

55

00:02:02,870  -->  00:02:04,970
and your applications must be set up
56

56

00:02:04,970  -->  00:02:06,860
to trust your private CA.
57

57

00:02:06,860  -->  00:02:09,190
So, the definition of a private CA is that it's not public.
58

58

00:02:09,190  -->  00:02:11,572
So it's yours, it's not widely known.
59

59

00:02:11,572  -->  00:02:15,387
And so, for your application to trust any SSL certificates
60

60

00:02:15,387  -->  00:02:17,082
that is created outside of your,
61

61

00:02:17,082  -->  00:02:19,750
from your private CA,
62

62

00:02:19,750  -->  00:02:21,750
that means that your application need to trust
63

63

00:02:21,750  -->  00:02:24,680
the certificate of the CA itself.
64

64

00:02:24,680  -->  00:02:26,150
For the certificate renewal,
65

65

00:02:26,150  -->  00:02:29,940
in case you provision the certificate using ACM,
66

66

00:02:29,940  -->  00:02:32,580
it's automatically done by ACM,
67

67

00:02:32,580  -->  00:02:36,210
or, if you have manually uploaded a certificate into ACM,
68

68

00:02:36,210  -->  00:02:38,310
you will need to be performing the renewal
69

69

00:02:38,310  -->  00:02:39,340
of that certificates manually,
70

70

00:02:39,340  -->  00:02:41,660
so a bit more maintenance on your side.
71

71

00:02:41,660  -->  00:02:45,070
Finally, very, very, very, very important,
72

72

00:02:45,070  -->  00:02:47,610
ACM is a regional service.
73

73

00:02:47,610  -->  00:02:49,770
That means that if you have a global application,
74

74

00:02:49,770  -->  00:02:52,070
with multiple ALB all around the world
75

75

00:02:52,070  -->  00:02:53,740
in different AWS regions,
76

76

00:02:53,740  -->  00:02:57,561
you will need to issue an SSL certificate in each region
77

77

00:02:57,561  -->  00:03:00,340
where your application is deployed.
78

78

00:03:00,340  -->  00:03:03,210
So, you cannot use ACM as a global service.
79

79

00:03:03,210  -->  00:03:04,460
It's a regional service.
80

80

00:03:04,460  -->  00:03:07,330
And you cannot copy certificates across regions.
81

81

00:03:07,330  -->  00:03:10,530
So, you will have to have ACM provision a certificate
82

82

00:03:10,530  -->  00:03:13,620
in every single region where you have load-balancers,
83

83

00:03:13,620  -->  00:03:15,740
for example, for this to work.
84

84

00:03:15,740  -->  00:03:17,433
Obviously, if you use CloudFront,
85

85

00:03:17,433  -->  00:03:18,740
CloudFront is a global distribution,
86

86

00:03:18,740  -->  00:03:20,430
so you don't need to do this, right?
87

87

00:03:20,430  -->  00:03:22,820
But if you have an ALB deployed in multiple regions,
88

88

00:03:22,820  -->  00:03:25,800
then you need to remember that ACM is a regional service
89

89

00:03:25,800  -->  00:03:27,910
and so, you need to have multiple SSL certificates,
90

90

00:03:27,910  -->  00:03:30,300
all around the globe, for this to work.
91

91

00:03:30,300  -->  00:03:31,610
All right, that's it for ACM.
92

92

00:03:31,610  -->  00:03:33,360
I will see you in the next lecture.
