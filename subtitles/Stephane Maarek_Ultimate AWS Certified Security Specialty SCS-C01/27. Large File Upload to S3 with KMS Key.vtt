00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:02.220
<v ->So here is a tricky use case</v>
2

2

00:00:02.220  -->  00:00:05.610
for an exam question, and that is quite unintuitive
3

3

00:00:05.610  -->  00:00:07.080
but makes sense when I explain it.
4

4

00:00:07.080  -->  00:00:09.330
So how do you upload a large file
5

5

00:00:09.330  -->  00:00:12.870
to Amazon S3 that is KMS encrypted?
6

6

00:00:12.870  -->  00:00:14.010
So when you upload a large file,
7

7

00:00:14.010  -->  00:00:16.830
of course you must use a multi-part upload.
8

8

00:00:16.830  -->  00:00:18.930
And then what permissions do we need
9

9

00:00:18.930  -->  00:00:20.370
for that multi-part upload?
10

10

00:00:20.370  -->  00:00:22.710
Well, number one, we want to generate a data key,
11

11

00:00:22.710  -->  00:00:25.650
because while we want to make sure we can encrypt the file
12

12

00:00:25.650  -->  00:00:29.640
and encrypt each specific part,
13

13

00:00:29.640  -->  00:00:33.180
but then we also need the KMS decrypt permission
14

14

00:00:33.180  -->  00:00:34.890
to be able to decrypt these parts
15

15

00:00:34.890  -->  00:00:37.950
before they can be reassembled, and then re-encrypt it.
16

16

00:00:37.950  -->  00:00:38.880
And that's the trick.
17

17

00:00:38.880  -->  00:00:40.710
We're missing the decrypt option.
18

18

00:00:40.710  -->  00:00:42.360
So, let's take an example.
19

19

00:00:42.360  -->  00:00:44.160
With a user with the proper permissions,
20

20

00:00:44.160  -->  00:00:45.330
there is a large file.
21

21

00:00:45.330  -->  00:00:48.150
It does get split up into multiple parts.
22

22

00:00:48.150  -->  00:00:51.960
Each part is going to be encrypted with its own data key.
23

23

00:00:51.960  -->  00:00:53.160
Each key is going to be...
24

24

00:00:53.160  -->  00:00:56.550
each file encrypted is going to be uploaded into Amazon S3.
25

25

00:00:56.550  -->  00:00:59.910
Amazon S3 will use the decrypt operation
26

26

00:00:59.910  -->  00:01:02.490
to decrypt each file into plain text
27

27

00:01:02.490  -->  00:01:05.190
and then recombine them into an S3 object.
28

28

00:01:05.190  -->  00:01:08.640
And this S3 object is going to be again encrypted
29

29

00:01:08.640  -->  00:01:10.560
into the final object.
30

30

00:01:10.560  -->  00:01:11.550
Funky, right?
31

31

00:01:11.550  -->  00:01:12.780
But what you have to remember is
32

32

00:01:12.780  -->  00:01:16.170
that you need two kind of permissions, including decrypt,
33

33

00:01:16.170  -->  00:01:17.850
for doing a large file upload
34

34

00:01:17.850  -->  00:01:20.430
to Amazon S3 with KMS encryption.
35

35

00:01:20.430  -->  00:01:21.630
Okay, that's it for this lecture.
36

36

00:01:21.630  -->  00:01:22.650
I hope you liked it.
37

37

00:01:22.650  -->  00:01:24.600
And I will see you in the next lecture.
