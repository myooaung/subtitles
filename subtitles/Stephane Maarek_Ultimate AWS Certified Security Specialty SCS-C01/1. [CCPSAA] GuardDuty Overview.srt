00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:02,648
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about Amazon GuardDuty.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,648  -->  00:00:05,970
Duty GuardDuty helps you do intelligent threat discovery
3

3

00:00:05,970  -->  00:00:08,580
to protect your AWS accounts.
4

4

00:00:08,580  -->  00:00:09,660
How does it do it?
5

5

00:00:09,660  -->  00:00:11,610
Well, it has machine learning algorithm,
6

6

00:00:11,610  -->  00:00:13,080
performs anomaly detection,
7

7

00:00:13,080  -->  00:00:16,470
and uses third-party data to find these threats.
8

8

00:00:16,470  -->  00:00:18,240
So to enable it, it's just one click.
9

9

00:00:18,240  -->  00:00:19,860
Then you have a 30-day trial.
10

10

00:00:19,860  -->  00:00:22,020
You don't need to install any software.
11

11

00:00:22,020  -->  00:00:24,600
So GuardDuty is going to look at a lot of input data,
12

12

00:00:24,600  -->  00:00:26,670
such as your CloudTrail Event Logs to look
13

13

00:00:26,670  -->  00:00:30,210
for unusual API calls or unauthorized deployments.
14

14

00:00:30,210  -->  00:00:31,043
It's going to look
15

15

00:00:31,043  -->  00:00:34,050
at your management events and your data events.
16

16

00:00:34,050  -->  00:00:36,330
So for example, on the management side,
17

17

00:00:36,330  -->  00:00:39,060
the create VPC subnet event and so on,
18

18

00:00:39,060  -->  00:00:41,850
whereas on the S3 data events, for example,
19

19

00:00:41,850  -->  00:00:45,060
get object, list objects, delete objects, and so on.
20

20

00:00:45,060  -->  00:00:47,160
And then for VPC Flow Logs, it's going to look
21

21

00:00:47,160  -->  00:00:49,020
at unusual internet traffic,
22

22

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:52,650
it's going to look at unusual IP addresses.
23

23

00:00:52,650  -->  00:00:56,610
DNS logs to look at EC2 instances sending encoded data
24

24

00:00:56,610  -->  00:01:00,300
within DNS queries, which would mean they're compromised
25

25

00:01:00,300  -->  00:01:03,810
and Kubernetes Audit Logs to find suspicious activities
26

26

00:01:03,810  -->  00:01:07,890
on your EKS, your Kubernetes cluster compromises.
27

27

00:01:07,890  -->  00:01:10,800
So we can also set up EventBridge rules
28

28

00:01:10,800  -->  00:01:13,860
to be notified automatically in case you have findings.
29

29

00:01:13,860  -->  00:01:15,030
And then these rules can target
30

30

00:01:15,030  -->  00:01:17,070
whatever EventBridge can target,
31

31

00:01:17,070  -->  00:01:20,610
such as AWS Lambda, or SNS topics.
32

32

00:01:20,610  -->  00:01:22,860
Also, this can come up in the exam,
33

33

00:01:22,860  -->  00:01:25,680
GuardDuty is a very good tool to protect you
34

34

00:01:25,680  -->  00:01:27,540
against cryptocurrency attacks
35

35

00:01:27,540  -->  00:01:29,520
because there is a dedicated finding for it.
36

36

00:01:29,520  -->  00:01:32,190
So it knows how to analyze all these input data
37

37

00:01:32,190  -->  00:01:35,580
and find that there is a cryptocurrency attack.
38

38

00:01:35,580  -->  00:01:37,770
So to summarize, we have input data,
39

39

00:01:37,770  -->  00:01:41,820
such as VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail logs, DNS Logs
40

40

00:01:41,820  -->  00:01:44,250
and the EKS Audit Logs that will go
41

41

00:01:44,250  -->  00:01:47,910
into GuardDuty and will generate findings automatically.
42

42

00:01:47,910  -->  00:01:51,150
These findings can trigger automatically EventBridge events,
43

43

00:01:51,150  -->  00:01:55,350
which, thanks to rules, can end up in Lambda and SNS.
44

44

00:01:55,350  -->  00:01:56,340
So that's it for this lecture.
45

45

00:01:56,340  -->  00:01:59,313
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
