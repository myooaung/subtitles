00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.500
<v Instructor>So let's have a deeper look</v>
2

2

00:00:01.500  -->  00:00:05.100
at the integration between KMS and EBS.
3

3

00:00:05.100  -->  00:00:07.140
So you cannot change the encryption keys
4

4

00:00:07.140  -->  00:00:10.050
used by an EBS volume, but you can create a snapshot
5

5

00:00:10.050  -->  00:00:11.250
and you create a new EBS volume
6

6

00:00:11.250  -->  00:00:13.740
and then you can specify a new KMS key.
7

7

00:00:13.740  -->  00:00:15.930
So the process is we create a snapshot,
8

8

00:00:15.930  -->  00:00:17.160
and then we create a new volume,
9

9

00:00:17.160  -->  00:00:20.730
and this is when the key is going to change.
10

10

00:00:20.730  -->  00:00:22.557
So we can also automate cross-account
11

11

00:00:22.557  -->  00:00:25.110
EBS KMS-encrypted snapshot copies.
12

12

00:00:25.110  -->  00:00:26.940
This was very complicated to say.
13

13

00:00:26.940  -->  00:00:30.840
So we have account A and we have an EBS snapshot in here
14

14

00:00:30.840  -->  00:00:32.490
encrypted with the KMS key.
15

15

00:00:32.490  -->  00:00:34.230
What's going to do is that we're going to share
16

16

00:00:34.230  -->  00:00:36.300
this with a target accounts,
17

17

00:00:36.300  -->  00:00:39.390
and we need to make sure from an IAM permissions perspective
18

18

00:00:39.390  -->  00:00:41.970
that we have anything for grants, okay?
19

19

00:00:41.970  -->  00:00:43.770
Because we're going to share this
20

20

00:00:43.770  -->  00:00:45.630
and it's going to be used by a service.
21

21

00:00:45.630  -->  00:00:49.320
So then once this is done, we can copy to us-east-1.
22

22

00:00:49.320  -->  00:00:51.480
So it's going to be to the new account.
23

23

00:00:51.480  -->  00:00:54.027
So it's going to be decrypted by the first KMS key
24

24

00:00:54.027  -->  00:00:58.830
and it's going to be re-encrypt by the second KMS key.
25

25

00:00:58.830  -->  00:01:03.360
The KMS key policy in the target accounts is a bit special.
26

26

00:01:03.360  -->  00:01:06.097
So you'll have this one, and we're saying,
27

27

00:01:06.097  -->  00:01:09.570
"Hey, we allow to create grants
28

28

00:01:09.570  -->  00:01:12.330
for both these keys, for AWS resources."
29

29

00:01:12.330  -->  00:01:15.300
That's the left part of this slide.
30

30

00:01:15.300  -->  00:01:16.477
And on the right-hand side, we're saying,
31

31

00:01:16.477  -->  00:01:18.270
"Hey, we can encrypt, decrypt,
32

32

00:01:18.270  -->  00:01:21.960
re-encrypt using the first data key,
33

33

00:01:21.960  -->  00:01:24.150
the first KMS key in the first account,
34

34

00:01:24.150  -->  00:01:27.210
and the second KMS key in the second account."
35

35

00:01:27.210  -->  00:01:29.160
So it should make sense by now,
36

36

00:01:29.160  -->  00:01:30.690
but I would like to repeat myself
37

37

00:01:30.690  -->  00:01:32.490
just to make things very clear.
38

38

00:01:32.490  -->  00:01:34.380
So also for EBS encryption,
39

39

00:01:34.380  -->  00:01:37.050
there's an account level setting so that you make sure
40

40

00:01:37.050  -->  00:01:40.290
that every single EBS volume is going to be encrypted.
41

41

00:01:40.290  -->  00:01:42.060
So if you enable this volume, but if you don't,
42

42

00:01:42.060  -->  00:01:44.250
of course, they're not encrypted by default.
43

43

00:01:44.250  -->  00:01:47.550
So you need to enable this on the per-region setting.
44

44

00:01:47.550  -->  00:01:49.710
You go to your EC2 Console, Settings
45

45

00:01:49.710  -->  00:01:51.450
and then you have EBS encryption.
46

46

00:01:51.450  -->  00:01:55.320
And here you can define a default EBS key
47

47

00:01:55.320  -->  00:01:57.540
to encrypt your volumes with.
48

48

00:01:57.540  -->  00:02:01.320
So that's it for what you need to know between EBS and KMS.
49

49

00:02:01.320  -->  00:02:02.400
I hope you liked it
50

50

00:02:02.400  -->  00:02:04.443
and I will see you in the next lecture.
