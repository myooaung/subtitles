00:00:00.450  -->  00:00:03.180
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about AWS Organizations.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.180  -->  00:00:05.219
So it's a global service and it allows you
3

3

00:00:05.219  -->  00:00:09.330
to manage multiple AWS accounts at the same time.
4

4

00:00:09.330  -->  00:00:12.330
So you create an organization and the main account
5

5

00:00:12.330  -->  00:00:15.600
in your organization is called the management account,
6

6

00:00:15.600  -->  00:00:18.930
while the other accounts that join the organization
7

7

00:00:18.930  -->  00:00:21.120
or that are created from the organizations
8

8

00:00:21.120  -->  00:00:23.190
are called member accounts.
9

9

00:00:23.190  -->  00:00:27.120
And member accounts can only be part of one organization.
10

10

00:00:27.120  -->  00:00:29.880
The cool thing about organization is that the billing
11

11

00:00:29.880  -->  00:00:32.790
is consolidated across all the accounts,
12

12

00:00:32.790  -->  00:00:34.620
so you have a single payment method
13

13

00:00:34.620  -->  00:00:36.390
on the management accounts
14

14

00:00:36.390  -->  00:00:39.930
and then it will be paying for all the organization's cost.
15

15

00:00:39.930  -->  00:00:41.610
But because you have an organization
16

16

00:00:41.610  -->  00:00:43.950
and it's all part of one big family
17

17

00:00:43.950  -->  00:00:47.460
then you get pricing benefits from aggregated usage.
18

18

00:00:47.460  -->  00:00:50.640
So if you use a lot of EC2 or if you use a lot Amazon S3
19

19

00:00:50.640  -->  00:00:53.640
across all your accounts, then you will get big discounts
20

20

00:00:53.640  -->  00:00:56.010
because it will summarize and sum up
21

21

00:00:56.010  -->  00:00:58.113
all the usage across all the accounts.
22

22

00:00:59.520  -->  00:01:01.920
You can also share reserved instances
23

23

00:01:01.920  -->  00:01:04.620
and savings plans discounts across accounts.
24

24

00:01:04.620  -->  00:01:08.100
So if a reserved instance is unused in one accounts
25

25

00:01:08.100  -->  00:01:09.660
another account can benefit from it
26

26

00:01:09.660  -->  00:01:11.850
and therefore the discounts apply
27

27

00:01:11.850  -->  00:01:13.410
across the entire organization
28

28

00:01:13.410  -->  00:01:15.600
which is really good for cost savings.
29

29

00:01:15.600  -->  00:01:19.110
Now there's also an API to automate the account creation
30

30

00:01:19.110  -->  00:01:20.550
from within the organization.
31

31

00:01:20.550  -->  00:01:22.380
So you can create accounts very easily
32

32

00:01:22.380  -->  00:01:24.360
using an organization.
33

33

00:01:24.360  -->  00:01:25.193
So how does that work?
34

34

00:01:25.193  -->  00:01:29.580
So we have what's called a Root Organizational Unit or OU
35

35

00:01:29.580  -->  00:01:33.720
and this is the outermost OU of your accounts.
36

36

00:01:33.720  -->  00:01:36.810
And then within it sits the management accounts.
37

37

00:01:36.810  -->  00:01:38.700
Then you can create sub OUs,
38

38

00:01:38.700  -->  00:01:42.180
so you can create, for example an OU for the dev accounts
39

39

00:01:42.180  -->  00:01:45.360
and then you can create member accounts within the dev OU
40

40

00:01:45.360  -->  00:01:47.700
or you can create OU for a prod account
41

41

00:01:47.700  -->  00:01:49.530
and also add member accounts there
42

42

00:01:49.530  -->  00:01:51.240
but you can be as free as you want.
43

43

00:01:51.240  -->  00:01:55.380
You can create within the prod OU an OU for your HR
44

44

00:01:55.380  -->  00:01:58.860
member accounts and an OU for your finance member accounts.
45

45

00:01:58.860  -->  00:02:01.170
So you can organize it the way you want.
46

46

00:02:01.170  -->  00:02:04.890
So you have different examples for your business,
47

47

00:02:04.890  -->  00:02:05.723
for your OU.
48

48

00:02:05.723  -->  00:02:07.500
So you can organize by business units,
49

49

00:02:07.500  -->  00:02:09.960
so you have, for example, the management accounts
50

50

00:02:09.960  -->  00:02:12.570
and then the sales, retail, and finance OU,
51

51

00:02:12.570  -->  00:02:15.480
and then different accounts within each OU,
52

52

00:02:15.480  -->  00:02:17.970
or you can have an OU by environment.
53

53

00:02:17.970  -->  00:02:21.240
So for example, one OU for prod, one OU for test,
54

54

00:02:21.240  -->  00:02:24.034
one OU for dev, and within each OU some accounts,
55

55

00:02:24.034  -->  00:02:27.570
or project based, so you can have an OU per project within,
56

56

00:02:27.570  -->  00:02:29.220
and accounts within each project, so,
57

57

00:02:29.220  -->  00:02:30.053
and you can mix and match,
58

58

00:02:30.053  -->  00:02:32.490
you're really free to do whatever you want.
59

59

00:02:32.490  -->  00:02:35.790
So what are the advantages of using organizations?
60

60

00:02:35.790  -->  00:02:38.790
Well, thanks to having multiple accounts,
61

61

00:02:38.790  -->  00:02:41.430
you can have better security versus having
62

62

00:02:41.430  -->  00:02:43.380
one account with multiple VPC,
63

63

00:02:43.380  -->  00:02:46.110
because accounts are more separated than VPCs.
64

64

00:02:46.110  -->  00:02:49.590
You can also enforce tagging standards for billing purposes
65

65

00:02:49.590  -->  00:02:52.200
and you can in one go enable CloudTrail
66

66

00:02:52.200  -->  00:02:53.670
for all your accounts
67

67

00:02:53.670  -->  00:02:57.510
and send all the logs into a central S3 account
68

68

00:02:57.510  -->  00:02:59.520
or we can also send CloudWatch Logs
69

69

00:02:59.520  -->  00:03:01.170
to central logging accounts.
70

70

00:03:01.170  -->  00:03:03.090
And we can establish cross account roles
71

71

00:03:03.090  -->  00:03:04.950
for admin purposes automatically,
72

72

00:03:04.950  -->  00:03:07.020
so we can administer all the member accounts
73

73

00:03:07.020  -->  00:03:09.420
from the management accounts.
74

74

00:03:09.420  -->  00:03:11.190
So these are big advantages.
75

75

00:03:11.190  -->  00:03:13.950
Also, there's a big security advantage,
76

76

00:03:13.950  -->  00:03:17.880
we can define Service Control Policies or SCP
77

77

00:03:17.880  -->  00:03:22.260
and it's an IAM policy applied to specific OUs or accounts
78

78

00:03:22.260  -->  00:03:25.500
and this allows you to restrict what the users and roles,
79

79

00:03:25.500  -->  00:03:28.200
all of them can do within the accounts.
80

80

00:03:28.200  -->  00:03:33.150
The SCPs apply to everything but to the management accounts
81

81

00:03:33.150  -->  00:03:35.460
which will forever have full admin power,
82

82

00:03:35.460  -->  00:03:38.700
otherwise you could do a mistake
83

83

00:03:38.700  -->  00:03:40.170
and never come back from it.
84

84

00:03:40.170  -->  00:03:42.000
So the SCPs by default,
85

85

00:03:42.000  -->  00:03:44.070
they don't allow anything just like IAM.
86

86

00:03:44.070  -->  00:03:47.100
You need to have an explicit allow for things to work.
87

87

00:03:47.100  -->  00:03:50.310
So let's go through an example to understand how that works.
88

88

00:03:50.310  -->  00:03:54.210
So let's take, for example, this organization.
89

89

00:03:54.210  -->  00:03:55.887
We have the Root OU and the Management Account
90

90

00:03:55.887  -->  00:03:59.100
and then we have a Prod OU and we have an Account A in it
91

91

00:03:59.100  -->  00:04:00.977
and then we have two sub OUs, the HR OU,
92

92

00:04:00.977  -->  00:04:04.110
and the Finance OU with Account B and Account C.
93

93

00:04:04.110  -->  00:04:06.240
And let's have a look at how SCPs will affect
94

94

00:04:06.240  -->  00:04:08.070
the permissions of each accounts.
95

95

00:04:08.070  -->  00:04:11.970
So at the Root OU, it is very common to attach
96

96

00:04:11.970  -->  00:04:15.450
the full AWS access SCP
97

97

00:04:15.450  -->  00:04:19.740
and therefore any accounts within the Root OU
98

98

00:04:19.740  -->  00:04:21.840
will have full permissions on their accounts.
99

99

00:04:21.840  -->  00:04:24.360
That means the management accounts, the account AIM prod,
100

100

00:04:24.360  -->  00:04:27.600
the account B and account C, well can do anything they want.
101

101

00:04:27.600  -->  00:04:29.970
And then we would apply more SCPs.
102

102

00:04:29.970  -->  00:04:31.560
So that's one way of doing things, of course,
103

103

00:04:31.560  -->  00:04:33.840
and I'm going show you the most common way.
104

104

00:04:33.840  -->  00:04:36.630
So then let's apply a DenyAccessAthena SCP
105

105

00:04:36.630  -->  00:04:40.140
on the Management Account, we apply a DenyRedshift SCP
106

106

00:04:40.140  -->  00:04:43.950
on the OU in Prod and then more SCPs, and let's have a look
107

107

00:04:43.950  -->  00:04:47.490
at what it does for each account's perspective, okay?
108

108

00:04:47.490  -->  00:04:49.830
So for the Management Account,
109

109

00:04:49.830  -->  00:04:53.820
even though we have applied the DenyAccessAthena SCP
110

110

00:04:53.820  -->  00:04:56.250
to deny access to the Athena service,
111

111

00:04:56.250  -->  00:04:59.220
the management accounts can still do anything
112

112

00:04:59.220  -->  00:05:01.560
because no SCP applied to it.
113

113

00:05:01.560  -->  00:05:03.600
So the management account has full admin power
114

114

00:05:03.600  -->  00:05:05.280
over everything.
115

115

00:05:05.280  -->  00:05:08.250
Okay, now what about account A?
116

116

00:05:08.250  -->  00:05:10.920
So account A is in the Root OU,
117

117

00:05:10.920  -->  00:05:12.990
so it can do a lot of things
118

118

00:05:12.990  -->  00:05:17.040
and then it's also in the Prod OU and on the Prod OU
119

119

00:05:17.040  -->  00:05:18.693
there is the DenyRedshift SCP
120

120

00:05:18.693  -->  00:05:23.130
that has been attached to it and therefore the Account A
121

121

00:05:23.130  -->  00:05:26.490
does not have access to Redshift
122

122

00:05:26.490  -->  00:05:29.790
even though we have attached an SCP on top of the Account A
123

123

00:05:29.790  -->  00:05:33.600
saying authorized Redshift, because if there is one deny
124

124

00:05:33.600  -->  00:05:35.820
in your policy, an explicit deny,
125

125

00:05:35.820  -->  00:05:37.620
then by default it's denied.
126

126

00:05:37.620  -->  00:05:40.680
So account A, in this example can do anything
127

127

00:05:40.680  -->  00:05:43.680
but access the Redshift service.
128

128

00:05:43.680  -->  00:05:47.580
Now, if you look at Accounts B it's within the HR OU
129

129

00:05:47.580  -->  00:05:50.790
which is within the Prod OU, so it inherits everything.
130

130

00:05:50.790  -->  00:05:54.781
So Account B has full AWS access from the Root OU,
131

131

00:05:54.781  -->  00:05:57.980
DenyRedshift SCP from the Prod OU
132

132

00:05:57.980  -->  00:06:00.989
and DenyLambda SCP from the HR OU
133

133

00:06:00.989  -->  00:06:02.739
and therefore it can do anything
134

134

00:06:02.739  -->  00:06:05.906
but access Redshift and access Lambda.
135

135

00:06:08.141  -->  00:06:10.992
And now, Account C is within the Finance OU
136

136

00:06:10.992  -->  00:06:13.909
which is in the Prod OU, which is within the Root OU
137

137

00:06:13.909  -->  00:06:17.730
and therefore it can do anything except access Redshift.
138

138

00:06:17.730  -->  00:06:19.380
So we've seen a few examples of SCP
139

139

00:06:19.380  -->  00:06:21.810
and hopefully this is clear to you.
140

140

00:06:21.810  -->  00:06:24.750
So two strategies for SCP,
141

141

00:06:24.750  -->  00:06:26.910
you have a block list or an allow list.
142

142

00:06:26.910  -->  00:06:29.700
So a block list is saying, hey,
143

143

00:06:29.700  -->  00:06:32.940
here are the services that I don't want you to use.
144

144

00:06:32.940  -->  00:06:36.000
So usually we attach first an allow star
145

145

00:06:36.000  -->  00:06:38.580
to allow all actions on all services
146

146

00:06:38.580  -->  00:06:40.590
and then we attach a denied statement, for example,
147

147

00:06:40.590  -->  00:06:42.670
to deny access to DynamoDB
148

148

00:06:43.530  -->  00:06:47.070
or allow list is we don't allow elections, which only allow
149

149

00:06:47.070  -->  00:06:49.710
for example, in this example, EC2 and CloudWatch.
150

150

00:06:49.710  -->  00:06:52.260
And so only EC2 and CloudWatch are authorized
151

151

00:06:52.260  -->  00:06:55.860
on your account where this SCP has been attached
152

152

00:06:55.860  -->  00:06:57.780
and any other service is not usable
153

153

00:06:57.780  -->  00:07:00.990
because it would need an explicit allow to be used.
154

154

00:07:00.990  -->  00:07:02.580
So that's it for organizations,
155
