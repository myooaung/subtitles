00:00:00.300  -->  00:00:02.820
<v Instructor>So just a quick lecture about VPC Flow Logs.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.820  -->  00:00:05.160
Some traffic is not captured by it,
3

3

00:00:05.160  -->  00:00:07.290
and this can come up in one question on the exam,
4

4

00:00:07.290  -->  00:00:08.730
so watch out for it.
5

5

00:00:08.730  -->  00:00:12.300
So, you have the traffic to the Amazon DNS Server,
6

6

00:00:12.300  -->  00:00:15.810
so only the custom DNS Server traffic is logged.
7

7

00:00:15.810  -->  00:00:19.350
The traffic for Amazon Windows license activation,
8

8

00:00:19.350  -->  00:00:23.340
the traffic to the EC2 instance metadata service,
9

9

00:00:23.340  -->  00:00:28.110
and the Amazon Time Sync service, all DHCP traffic,
10

10

00:00:28.110  -->  00:00:30.600
all mirrored traffic, and the traffic
11

11

00:00:30.600  -->  00:00:32.790
to the VPC router reserved IP address,
12

12

00:00:32.790  -->  00:00:36.270
this is the first IP of your VPC,
13

13

00:00:36.270  -->  00:00:39.000
and the traffic between your VPC Endpoint ENI
14

14

00:00:39.000  -->  00:00:41.580
and the Network Load Balancer ENI.
15

15

00:00:41.580  -->  00:00:42.780
Alright, that's a short one.
16

16

00:00:42.780  -->  00:00:45.780
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
