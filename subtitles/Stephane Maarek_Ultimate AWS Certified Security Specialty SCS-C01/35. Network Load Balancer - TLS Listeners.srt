00:00:00,090  -->  00:00:02,400
<v Instructor>So here is a specific lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:02,400  -->  00:00:05,160
for TLS and your network balancer.
3

3

00:00:05,160  -->  00:00:07,740
So if you want to have a TLS listener,
4

4

00:00:07,740  -->  00:00:09,600
you can use it on your NLB.
5

5

00:00:09,600  -->  00:00:11,850
So it will use the server certificate
6

6

00:00:11,850  -->  00:00:14,160
to terminate the TLS traffic
7

7

00:00:14,160  -->  00:00:16,650
and then it will decrypt the front end connections
8

8

00:00:16,650  -->  00:00:20,250
and then they will send it to the targets unencrypted.
9

9

00:00:20,250  -->  00:00:21,780
If you wanna create a TLS listener,
10

10

00:00:21,780  -->  00:00:24,990
you must create a certificate in ACM
11

11

00:00:24,990  -->  00:00:27,240
and then you attach it on your NLB.
12

12

00:00:27,240  -->  00:00:29,970
And even if you have TLS termination
13

13

00:00:29,970  -->  00:00:34,350
on your NLB, with client IP preservation setting enabled,
14

14

00:00:34,350  -->  00:00:38,790
the target instances, we'll still see the source IP address
15

15

00:00:38,790  -->  00:00:41,880
and port as if it comes from your clients.
16

16

00:00:41,880  -->  00:00:43,440
So the diagram is like this.
17

17

00:00:43,440  -->  00:00:46,500
The client, for example, talks to the TLS listener
18

18

00:00:46,500  -->  00:00:49,230
on port 443 of your network load balancer,
19

19

00:00:49,230  -->  00:00:51,270
which has TLS termination enabled
20

20

00:00:51,270  -->  00:00:52,710
because it has a certificate.
21

21

00:00:52,710  -->  00:00:55,260
What's going to happen is that the EC2 instances
22

22

00:00:55,260  -->  00:00:56,220
in your target group
23

23

00:00:56,220  -->  00:00:59,760
are going to see HTTP unencrypted traffic
24

24

00:00:59,760  -->  00:01:02,790
from your network load balancer, and the source IP of that
25

25

00:01:02,790  -->  00:01:04,950
if client IP preservation is enabled
26

26

00:01:04,950  -->  00:01:07,980
is going to be the IP of your client.
27

27

00:01:07,980  -->  00:01:10,830
Now, with this kind of mechanism,
28

28

00:01:10,830  -->  00:01:13,170
because the traffic is terminated
29

29

00:01:13,170  -->  00:01:16,830
at the NLB level from an encryption perspective,
30

30

00:01:16,830  -->  00:01:21,000
then these networks do not support TLS renegotiation,
31

31

00:01:21,000  -->  00:01:24,120
or mutual TLS authentication, mTLS
32

32

00:01:24,120  -->  00:01:27,360
because it has to be done directly by the client
33

33

00:01:27,360  -->  00:01:31,290
with the EC2 instances and not by the NLB.
34

34

00:01:31,290  -->  00:01:32,760
So how do we do this?
35

35

00:01:32,760  -->  00:01:35,070
Well, the option to do this kind
36

36

00:01:35,070  -->  00:01:39,000
of end-to-end encryption is to use a TCP listener,
37

37

00:01:39,000  -->  00:01:40,560
so not an encrypted one
38

38

00:01:40,560  -->  00:01:45,330
but you define it on port 443, even though it's just TCP.
39

39

00:01:45,330  -->  00:01:48,450
And what's going to happen is that all this TCP traffic
40

40

00:01:48,450  -->  00:01:51,240
is going to be passed encrypted to the target
41

41

00:01:51,240  -->  00:01:54,360
without the NLB decrypting it or terminating it.
42

42

00:01:54,360  -->  00:01:58,602
So we don't use a TLS listener, and it is the responsibility
43

43

00:01:58,602  -->  00:02:02,370
of the target group to actually decrypt the traffic.
44

44

00:02:02,370  -->  00:02:03,203
So how does that work?
45

45

00:02:03,203  -->  00:02:06,240
The clients sends encrypted traffic through your NLB
46

46

00:02:06,240  -->  00:02:08,640
but we have a TCP listener this time.
47

47

00:02:08,640  -->  00:02:10,920
Then the same traffic is going to be passed
48

48

00:02:10,920  -->  00:02:13,830
in encrypted to your EC2 instances,
49

49

00:02:13,830  -->  00:02:18,000
which are the one that will be performing TLS termination.
50

50

00:02:18,000  -->  00:02:21,570
And when you have the setting, you support mutual TLS
51

51

00:02:21,570  -->  00:02:24,540
because well, the NLB will pass the traffic as is
52

52

00:02:24,540  -->  00:02:27,420
and then the mutual TLS authentication
53

53

00:02:27,420  -->  00:02:28,890
can be implemented directly
54

54

00:02:28,890  -->  00:02:31,980
on your EC2 instances as targets.
55

55

00:02:31,980  -->  00:02:34,950
So something to know that once you see it in the exam,
56

56

00:02:34,950  -->  00:02:36,090
it would make sense.
57

57

00:02:36,090  -->  00:02:36,923
So I hope you liked it
58

58

00:02:36,923  -->  00:02:39,183
and I will see you in the next lecture.
