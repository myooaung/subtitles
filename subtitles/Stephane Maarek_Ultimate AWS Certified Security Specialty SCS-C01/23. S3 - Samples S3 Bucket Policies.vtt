00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.950
<v Instructor>So here is a short lecture to show you</v>
2

2

00:00:01.950  -->  00:00:05.370
some simple S3 bucket policies that can come up in the exam.
3

3

00:00:05.370  -->  00:00:07.320
So the first one is to force HTTPS
4

4

00:00:07.320  -->  00:00:09.000
for encryption in flight.
5

5

00:00:09.000  -->  00:00:11.640
So in that case, we wanna have a bucket policy
6

6

00:00:11.640  -->  00:00:13.770
where we deny any request
7

7

00:00:13.770  -->  00:00:16.500
where the SecureTransport is false.
8

8

00:00:16.500  -->  00:00:18.990
That means that we're not using HTTPS.
9

9

00:00:18.990  -->  00:00:23.190
So HTTP will be denied and HTTPS is going to be allowed.
10

10

00:00:23.190  -->  00:00:24.150
It's something you've seen.
11

11

00:00:24.150  -->  00:00:26.580
Now you should know about this condition.
12

12

00:00:26.580  -->  00:00:29.250
The second one is to restrict by public IP address.
13

13

00:00:29.250  -->  00:00:31.650
So we take an S3 bucket
14

14

00:00:31.650  -->  00:00:34.950
and we access it by using the public API.
15

15

00:00:34.950  -->  00:00:36.600
So here we block traffic
16

16

00:00:36.600  -->  00:00:39.780
unless we have a specified source IP
17

17

00:00:39.780  -->  00:00:44.160
that is contained within a CIDR of IP addresses.
18

18

00:00:44.160  -->  00:00:47.460
So here, we deny users that don't have the correct IP
19

19

00:00:47.460  -->  00:00:49.290
and users that do have the correct IP,
20

20

00:00:49.290  -->  00:00:51.060
for example, from a corporate office,
21

21

00:00:51.060  -->  00:00:54.393
are able to do API calls against my S3 buckets.
22

22

00:00:55.260  -->  00:00:58.350
Lastly, it's possible for you to restrict by user id.
23

23

00:00:58.350  -->  00:01:01.170
So we have an S3 bucket and we want to restrict access
24

24

00:01:01.170  -->  00:01:02.580
only for specific users.
25

25

00:01:02.580  -->  00:01:04.110
So how do we do this?
26

26

00:01:04.110  -->  00:01:07.050
Well, we have a AWS userId tag.
27

27

00:01:07.050  -->  00:01:11.280
So we have the Role ID we can reference or the User ID
28

28

00:01:11.280  -->  00:01:14.400
or the Account ID, and that's how we restrict access
29

29

00:01:14.400  -->  00:01:16.860
for a bucket from specific id.
30

30

00:01:16.860  -->  00:01:19.500
So for example, this account cannot access it,
31

31

00:01:19.500  -->  00:01:21.870
but that account can access it.
32

32

00:01:21.870  -->  00:01:23.610
All right, that's it for the bucket policies.
33

33

00:01:23.610  -->  00:01:26.793
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
