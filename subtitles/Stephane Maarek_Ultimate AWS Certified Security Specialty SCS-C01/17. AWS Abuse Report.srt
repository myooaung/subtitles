00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:01,050
<v Instructor>So now, let's talk</v>
2

2

00:00:01,050  -->  00:00:03,390
about the AWS abuse reports.
3

3

00:00:03,390  -->  00:00:06,660
So, if you suspect that some AWS resources are used
4

4

00:00:06,660  -->  00:00:09,270
for abusive or illegal purposes,
5

5

00:00:09,270  -->  00:00:11,400
then you can create an abuse report.
6

6

00:00:11,400  -->  00:00:12,870
So, they could be for anything such
7

7

00:00:12,870  -->  00:00:16,950
as spam, port scanning, DDoS attacks, intrusion attempts,
8

8

00:00:16,950  -->  00:00:20,010
hosting prohibited content, or distributing malware.
9

9

00:00:20,010  -->  00:00:24,000
In that case, you just contact the AWS Trust and Safety Team
10

10

00:00:24,000  -->  00:00:26,250
with all the details and they will take care of it.
11

11

00:00:26,250  -->  00:00:28,740
So, for example, you notice that a hacker,
12

12

00:00:28,740  -->  00:00:32,160
as part of an account, is sending you spam emails
13

13

00:00:32,160  -->  00:00:33,270
and you detect it's coming
14

14

00:00:33,270  -->  00:00:37,620
from AWS because the IP range belongs to AWS,
15

15

00:00:37,620  -->  00:00:40,770
therefore, you can create an abuse report with the Trust
16

16

00:00:40,770  -->  00:00:43,770
and Safety Team, and then they will notify the accounts.
17

17

00:00:43,770  -->  00:00:46,800
So, if you're in the case of receiving an email
18

18

00:00:46,800  -->  00:00:48,870
from the Trust and Safety Team saying
19

19

00:00:48,870  -->  00:00:52,020
that some resources are used for illegal activities,
20

20

00:00:52,020  -->  00:00:53,580
then you must respond to the email
21

21

00:00:53,580  -->  00:00:56,910
and explain how you are preventing this kind of activity
22

22

00:00:56,910  -->  00:00:59,400
and if you don't respond within 24 hours,
23

23

00:00:59,400  -->  00:01:02,880
then AWS might suspend your AWS account.
24

24

00:01:02,880  -->  00:01:03,780
Alright, that's it.
25

25

00:01:03,780  -->  00:01:06,730
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
