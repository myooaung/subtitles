<v ->Now let's talk about the AWS client VPN.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,840  -->  00:00:05,760
So the idea is that you have your computer
3

3

00:00:05,760  -->  00:00:09,930
and you want to privately connect into your AWS VPC.
4

4

00:00:09,930  -->  00:00:12,300
Therefore you will leverage the client VPN
5

5

00:00:12,300  -->  00:00:15,150
to establish a connection using the open VPN
6

6

00:00:15,150  -->  00:00:18,030
to your private network in AWS or on premises.
7

7

00:00:18,030  -->  00:00:19,830
I will show you how in the second.
8

8

00:00:19,830  -->  00:00:21,240
Why would you want to do so?
9

9

00:00:21,240  -->  00:00:24,930
Well, for example say you have deployed EC2 instances
10

10

00:00:24,930  -->  00:00:28,350
in a private VPC and you want to access them
11

11

00:00:28,350  -->  00:00:29,880
using a private IP.
12

12

00:00:29,880  -->  00:00:32,280
Well, that's difficult if you don't have a VPN
13

13

00:00:32,280  -->  00:00:34,500
but if you have a VPN, then it's super easy.
14

14

00:00:34,500  -->  00:00:36,900
Once the VPN connection is established
15

15

00:00:36,900  -->  00:00:39,090
you will be able to access your EC2 instances
16

16

00:00:39,090  -->  00:00:40,770
using their private IP
17

17

00:00:40,770  -->  00:00:43,860
just as if you were in the VPC network yourself.
18

18

00:00:43,860  -->  00:00:45,660
So your VPC is right here
19

19

00:00:45,660  -->  00:00:50,070
and then your client's VPN is installed on your computer.
20

20

00:00:50,070  -->  00:00:53,220
You will establish the VPN connection over the internet.
21

21

00:00:53,220  -->  00:00:55,530
So this goes over the public internet, of course.
22

22

00:00:55,530  -->  00:00:58,500
And then you will be as if you are connected
23

23

00:00:58,500  -->  00:01:00,630
privately into your VPC.
24

24

00:01:00,630  -->  00:01:04,320
And if your VPC has established a site to site
25

25

00:01:04,320  -->  00:01:07,920
VPN connection to your on-premises data center
26

26

00:01:07,920  -->  00:01:11,610
then your computer will also be able to access,
27

27

00:01:11,610  -->  00:01:15,720
privately, your servers on your, on premises data center.
28

28

00:01:15,720  -->  00:01:17,580
And that's pretty magical, but it works.
29

29

00:01:17,580  -->  00:01:18,630
I hope you liked it.
30

30

00:01:18,630  -->  00:01:20,580
And I will see you in the next lecture.
