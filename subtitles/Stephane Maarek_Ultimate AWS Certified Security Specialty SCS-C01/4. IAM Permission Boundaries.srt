00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,983
<v Instructor>So, now let's talk</v>
2

2

00:00:00,983  -->  00:00:03,060
about IAM Permission Boundaries.
3

3

00:00:03,060  -->  00:00:05,430
So, permission boundaries are a concept
4

4

00:00:05,430  -->  00:00:07,860
that allows you to restrict an IAM policy,
5

5

00:00:07,860  -->  00:00:09,000
and they're supported only
6

6

00:00:09,000  -->  00:00:11,490
for users and roles, so not groups.
7

7

00:00:11,490  -->  00:00:12,600
And they are used
8

8

00:00:12,600  -->  00:00:16,380
to restrict the maximum permissions an IAM entity can get,
9

9

00:00:16,380  -->  00:00:18,360
so it's a bit complicated to understand.
10

10

00:00:18,360  -->  00:00:19,440
Let's go through an example.
11

11

00:00:19,440  -->  00:00:22,710
So, let's say here we have an IAM permission boundary
12

12

00:00:22,710  -->  00:00:25,320
where we say we allow s3:*, cloudwatch:*
13

13

00:00:25,320  -->  00:00:26,730
and ec2:*.
14

14

00:00:26,730  -->  00:00:28,620
That doesn't mean that we allow these things.
15

15

00:00:28,620  -->  00:00:30,000
That means that this is a boundary
16

16

00:00:30,000  -->  00:00:33,870
of what's possible to be allowed for your IAM policy.
17

17

00:00:33,870  -->  00:00:36,450
And then, if we have a permission right here
18

18

00:00:36,450  -->  00:00:38,880
that says Allow iam:CreateUser,
19

19

00:00:38,880  -->  00:00:42,150
that means that, the result, there is no permission.
20

20

00:00:42,150  -->  00:00:42,983
Why?
21

21

00:00:42,983  -->  00:00:44,460
Well, the right-hand side defines
22

22

00:00:44,460  -->  00:00:46,140
the actual permissions of the user,
23

23

00:00:46,140  -->  00:00:48,600
which is to allow iam:CreateUser,
24

24

00:00:48,600  -->  00:00:50,700
but the left-hand side restricted
25

25

00:00:50,700  -->  00:00:52,830
what the user can get permissions on,
26

26

00:00:52,830  -->  00:00:54,180
and the user is only allowed
27

27

00:00:54,180  -->  00:00:58,020
to have permissions on S3, CloudWatch and EC2.
28

28

00:00:58,020  -->  00:00:58,853
Therefore,
29

29

00:00:58,853  -->  00:01:02,190
the union of these two things represents no permissions.
30

30

00:01:02,190  -->  00:01:03,810
That's why it's called Permission Boundaries.
31

31

00:01:03,810  -->  00:01:06,420
You define the boundary of what's allowed
32

32

00:01:06,420  -->  00:01:09,450
for a policy to allow.
33

33

00:01:09,450  -->  00:01:10,710
So, these can be used
34

34

00:01:10,710  -->  00:01:14,730
in combination with AWS Organizations SCP.
35

35

00:01:14,730  -->  00:01:17,460
So, here we have the SCP, the permission boundary,
36

36

00:01:17,460  -->  00:01:19,380
and the identity-based policy,
37

37

00:01:19,380  -->  00:01:22,980
and the effective permissions are right in the center.
38

38

00:01:22,980  -->  00:01:24,060
So, permission boundaries,
39

39

00:01:24,060  -->  00:01:26,730
they operate a little bit like Organizations SCP.
40

40

00:01:26,730  -->  00:01:29,790
They just define what is the boundary of what's allowed,
41

41

00:01:29,790  -->  00:01:31,710
but then the identity-based policy defines
42

42

00:01:31,710  -->  00:01:33,270
what's actually allowed.
43

43

00:01:33,270  -->  00:01:34,230
So, the use cases
44

44

00:01:34,230  -->  00:01:36,930
for permission boundaries is to delegate responsibilities
45

45

00:01:36,930  -->  00:01:39,870
to non administrators within their permission boundaries,
46

46

00:01:39,870  -->  00:01:42,390
for example, to create new IAM users,
47

47

00:01:42,390  -->  00:01:45,480
or to allow developers to self-assign policies
48

48

00:01:45,480  -->  00:01:48,000
and manage their own permissions, while making sure
49

49

00:01:48,000  -->  00:01:51,000
they cannot elevate or escalate the privileges.
50

50

00:01:51,000  -->  00:01:52,440
For example, make themself admins
51

51

00:01:52,440  -->  00:01:54,420
because you have defined a boundary
52

52

00:01:54,420  -->  00:01:56,160
around their permissions.
53

53

00:01:56,160  -->  00:01:59,160
It's also very useful to restrict one specific user
54

54

00:01:59,160  -->  00:02:02,910
instead of a whole account using Organizations &amp; SCP,
55

55

00:02:02,910  -->  00:02:05,760
or to test out an SCP beforehand by just playing
56

56

00:02:05,760  -->  00:02:07,770
around with a permissions boundary.
57

57

00:02:07,770  -->  00:02:09,660
Okay, so I hope that helps you,
58

58

00:02:09,660  -->  00:02:11,703
and I will see you in the next lecture.
