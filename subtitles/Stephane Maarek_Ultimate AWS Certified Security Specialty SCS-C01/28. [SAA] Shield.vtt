00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:02.970
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about AWS Shields.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.970  -->  00:00:05.280
And Shield is a service to protect yourself
3

3

00:00:05.280  -->  00:00:06.720
from DDoS attacks.
4

4

00:00:06.720  -->  00:00:07.770
What is DDoS?
5

5

00:00:07.770  -->  00:00:10.800
Well, it's a distributed denial of service.
6

6

00:00:10.800  -->  00:00:13.590
And the idea is that your infrastructure
7

7

00:00:13.590  -->  00:00:16.470
is going to suddenly receive many, many requests
8

8

00:00:16.470  -->  00:00:17.430
at the same time
9

9

00:00:17.430  -->  00:00:20.940
from a lot of computers all around the world.
10

10

00:00:20.940  -->  00:00:23.100
And so the goal of it is to overwhelm
11

11

00:00:23.100  -->  00:00:25.740
and overload your infrastructure.
12

12

00:00:25.740  -->  00:00:28.260
And this way your infrastructure cannot serve
13

13

00:00:28.260  -->  00:00:29.370
your real users
14

14

00:00:29.370  -->  00:00:31.680
and this is what it's called a distributed denial
15

15

00:00:31.680  -->  00:00:32.940
of service.
16

16

00:00:32.940  -->  00:00:34.470
So we can protect against it,
17

17

00:00:34.470  -->  00:00:38.130
so we have the AWS Shield Standard service.
18

18

00:00:38.130  -->  00:00:39.030
It's a free service,
19

19

00:00:39.030  -->  00:00:42.330
it's already activated for every customer of AWS
20

20

00:00:42.330  -->  00:00:44.610
and is going to give you protection from attacks
21

21

00:00:44.610  -->  00:00:48.150
such as the SYN or UDP floods or any reflection attack
22

22

00:00:48.150  -->  00:00:51.720
or other layer 3, or layer 4 attacks.
23

23

00:00:51.720  -->  00:00:53.700
And if you want to get advanced protection,
24

24

00:00:53.700  -->  00:00:57.210
you can use the AWS Shield Advanced service.
25

25

00:00:57.210  -->  00:01:00.210
So this is an optional DDoS mitigation service.
26

26

00:01:00.210  -->  00:01:04.140
It costs around 3,000 per month per organization.
27

27

00:01:04.140  -->  00:01:06.210
And the idea is that you're going to get protected
28

28

00:01:06.210  -->  00:01:09.270
against more sophisticated DDoS attacks
29

29

00:01:09.270  -->  00:01:13.650
on Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront,
30

30

00:01:13.650  -->  00:01:17.190
the Global Accelerator and Route 53.
31

31

00:01:17.190  -->  00:01:20.070
It also gives you 24/7 access
32

32

00:01:20.070  -->  00:01:22.860
to the AWS DDoS response team.
33

33

00:01:22.860  -->  00:01:23.970
So in case you get attacked,
34

34

00:01:23.970  -->  00:01:25.260
you will have someone to help you
35

35

00:01:25.260  -->  00:01:27.240
and get you along the way.
36

36

00:01:27.240  -->  00:01:29.640
In case you are incurring higher fees
37

37

00:01:29.640  -->  00:01:31.500
because you are also being attacked,
38

38

00:01:31.500  -->  00:01:35.190
this Shield Advance protects you from these higher fees.
39

39

00:01:35.190  -->  00:01:39.240
And this Shield Advance has an automatic application layer,
40

40

00:01:39.240  -->  00:01:41.760
DDoS mitigation, and it's going to mean
41

41

00:01:41.760  -->  00:01:44.910
that it's automatically going to create and evaluate
42

42

00:01:44.910  -->  00:01:49.350
and deploy WAF rules to mitigate layer 7 attacks.
43

43

00:01:49.350  -->  00:01:52.080
So automatically your web application firewall
44

44

00:01:52.080  -->  00:01:56.010
will have rules to help you mitigate these attacks,
45

45

00:01:56.010  -->  00:02:00.090
DDoS attacks if they happen at the layer 7, which is great.
46

46

00:02:00.090  -->  00:02:02.400
So let's say for this lecture, I hope you liked it,
47

47

00:02:02.400  -->  00:02:04.350
and I will see you in the next lecture.
