00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:00.930
<v ->So let's get started</v>
2

2

00:00:00.930  -->  00:00:04.740
and really understand what IAM policies are made of.
3

3

00:00:04.740  -->  00:00:05.970
And we're going to do a deep dive
4

4

00:00:05.970  -->  00:00:08.190
in this section to really understand the structure
5

5

00:00:08.190  -->  00:00:10.214
of identity and access management.
6

6

00:00:10.214  -->  00:00:11.970
So we have an IAM policy
7

7

00:00:11.970  -->  00:00:15.185
and you've seen more than one I hope, in your AWS journey.
8

8

00:00:15.185  -->  00:00:18.747
The first line corresponds to the policy language version
9

9

00:00:18.747  -->  00:00:22.890
and you always include 2012-10-17.
10

10

00:00:22.890  -->  00:00:24.510
Then you have the policy identifier.
11

11

00:00:24.510  -->  00:00:26.565
This is optional just to name your policy.
12

12

00:00:26.565  -->  00:00:28.590
And then you have several statements
13

13

00:00:28.590  -->  00:00:30.600
in your policy, one or more.
14

14

00:00:30.600  -->  00:00:33.150
Each statement may also have a statement identifier.
15

15

00:00:33.150  -->  00:00:34.440
This is optional.
16

16

00:00:34.440  -->  00:00:35.280
And then it effects
17

17

00:00:35.280  -->  00:00:37.882
whether the statement is going to be allowed or denied.
18

18

00:00:37.882  -->  00:00:39.420
Then we have the principle
19

19

00:00:39.420  -->  00:00:41.790
and the principle represents the accounts, the user
20

20

00:00:41.790  -->  00:00:44.362
or the role to which this policy applies to.
21

21

00:00:44.362  -->  00:00:46.230
And then we have the list
22

22

00:00:46.230  -->  00:00:49.343
of the action that the policy will allow or deny.
23

23

00:00:49.343  -->  00:00:51.390
Then we have the resources
24

24

00:00:51.390  -->  00:00:53.410
that this policy is being applied to.
25

25

00:00:53.410  -->  00:00:55.783
And finally a condition that applies
26

26

00:00:55.783  -->  00:00:57.450
to the statement itself.
27

27

00:00:57.450  -->  00:00:59.310
And that's an optional block.
28

28

00:00:59.310  -->  00:01:00.143
So we are going to deconstruct all of this,
29

29

00:01:00.143  -->  00:01:02.931
see the different kind of options we have
30

30

00:01:02.931  -->  00:01:04.900
for pretty much everything in this.
31

31

00:01:04.900  -->  00:01:07.104
And by the end you should be very comfortable
32

32

00:01:07.104  -->  00:01:08.160
with IAM policy
33

33

00:01:08.160  -->  00:01:10.515
because they do come up quite a lot in the exam.
34

34

00:01:10.515  -->  00:01:13.770
So first of all, we've seen action and allow
35

35

00:01:13.770  -->  00:01:15.496
but there's something called NotAction.
36

36

00:01:15.496  -->  00:01:19.195
So when you have a NotAction, you provide access
37

37

00:01:19.195  -->  00:01:21.444
to all the actions in service except
38

38

00:01:21.444  -->  00:01:24.380
for the action specified in NotAction.
39

39

00:01:24.380  -->  00:01:26.941
So if we have this statement right here
40

40

00:01:26.941  -->  00:01:30.593
we have effect allow, NotAction, IAM star.
41

41

00:01:30.593  -->  00:01:35.340
That means that we allow everything but IAM.
42

42

00:01:35.340  -->  00:01:36.510
So we can allow S3,
43

43

00:01:36.510  -->  00:01:39.420
we can allow DynamoDB and so on because that's not IAM
44

44

00:01:39.420  -->  00:01:42.367
but IAM is not explicitly allowed in this.
45

45

00:01:42.367  -->  00:01:45.240
Just so you note, there is no deny statement.
46

46

00:01:45.240  -->  00:01:47.670
So we just allow everything but IAM.
47

47

00:01:47.670  -->  00:01:49.710
But it doesn't mean that we deny IAM.
48

48

00:01:49.710  -->  00:01:51.600
That means that in this one statement
49

49

00:01:51.600  -->  00:01:53.776
we don't authorize IAM.
50

50

00:01:53.776  -->  00:01:56.460
Next we can use also the resource element to
51

51

00:01:56.460  -->  00:01:58.065
provide a scope for the policy,
52

52

00:01:58.065  -->  00:02:01.920
therefore, limiting the actions to specific resources.
53

53

00:02:01.920  -->  00:02:06.193
So for example, here we have effect allow, NotAction
54

54

00:02:06.193  -->  00:02:10.530
delete bucket, resource the bucket itself.
55

55

00:02:10.530  -->  00:02:12.630
So that means that here we can do any kind
56

56

00:02:12.630  -->  00:02:17.630
of API calls on this bucket except the S3 delete bucket API.
57

57

00:02:18.390  -->  00:02:20.370
So it's very important for you to understand this kind
58

58

00:02:20.370  -->  00:02:23.540
of things because the NotAction does come up in the exam.
59

59

00:02:23.540  -->  00:02:25.860
Next we have the NotAction
60

60

00:02:25.860  -->  00:02:27.450
with deny and you use the NotAction
61

61

00:02:27.450  -->  00:02:31.280
with a deny statement to deny access to all the resources
62

62

00:02:31.280  -->  00:02:35.520
except the one that you've listed in the NotAction element.
63

63

00:02:35.520  -->  00:02:36.660
So this can be confusing
64

64

00:02:36.660  -->  00:02:39.000
and we'll have a look at this policy in a second.
65

65

00:02:39.000  -->  00:02:40.830
But what you do is that instead
66

66

00:02:40.830  -->  00:02:43.770
of explicitly allowing stuff, you explicitly
67

67

00:02:43.770  -->  00:02:47.585
deny all the actions that are not listed in this policy.
68

68

00:02:47.585  -->  00:02:50.580
But you must still allow explicitly the other
69

69

00:02:50.580  -->  00:02:53.300
actions you want to allow if an explicit allow is needed.
70

70

00:02:53.300  -->  00:02:56.280
So if we look at this policy right here,
71

71

00:02:56.280  -->  00:02:59.580
we have effect deny, NotAction IAM.
72

72

00:02:59.580  -->  00:03:04.273
So we deny everything that is not IAM, resource star
73

73

00:03:04.273  -->  00:03:08.010
when, so we deny everything that is not IAM
74

74

00:03:08.010  -->  00:03:11.700
when the multifactor is not present.
75

75

00:03:11.700  -->  00:03:14.280
So that means that we don't allow user to do anything
76

76

00:03:14.280  -->  00:03:17.693
on AWS if they're not using MFA.
77

77

00:03:17.693  -->  00:03:20.430
Except IAM because well to authenticate
78

78

00:03:20.430  -->  00:03:22.740
with IAM and get the MFA
79

79

00:03:22.740  -->  00:03:26.010
you need to have actually no MFA present
80

80

00:03:26.010  -->  00:03:27.810
because you're about to acquire it.
81

81

00:03:27.810  -->  00:03:30.957
So this policy itself is allowing the fact
82

82

00:03:30.957  -->  00:03:34.036
that we only want to allow the users
83

83

00:03:34.036  -->  00:03:37.860
to have MFA present when dealing with AWS.
84

84

00:03:37.860  -->  00:03:39.516
And if they don't connect with MFA
85

85

00:03:39.516  -->  00:03:42.030
then they cannot use AWS.
86

86

00:03:42.030  -->  00:03:43.860
Hopefully that makes sense.
87

87

00:03:43.860  -->  00:03:46.980
Now we have NotAction, too, also, for example,
88

88

00:03:46.980  -->  00:03:49.380
restrict to one specific region.
89

89

00:03:49.380  -->  00:03:52.456
So here we deny everything outside of EU Central One.
90

90

00:03:52.456  -->  00:03:56.796
The effect is deny and the NotAction is CloudFront.
91

91

00:03:56.796  -->  00:04:01.410
IAM, route53 support where the string is
92

92

00:04:01.410  -->  00:04:04.674
not equals to the requested region being EU central One.
93

93

00:04:04.674  -->  00:04:08.370
So that means that we deny anything outside of
94

94

00:04:08.370  -->  00:04:09.264
EU Central one.
95

95

00:04:09.264  -->  00:04:13.477
And the reason why we have CloudFront, IAM, route53,
96

96

00:04:13.477  -->  00:04:15.717
and support in the NotActions is that
97

97

00:04:15.717  -->  00:04:19.469
these services are in US East One
98

98

00:04:19.469  -->  00:04:21.977
because there are global services.
99

99

00:04:21.977  -->  00:04:25.620
Also, for example, we can deny everything outside
100

100

00:04:25.620  -->  00:04:26.460
of EU Central One
101

101

00:04:26.460  -->  00:04:31.460
except Amazon S3 by having effect deny NotAction S3 star.
102

102

00:04:31.980  -->  00:04:35.550
So we deny everything but S3 where the requested
103

103

00:04:35.550  -->  00:04:40.028
region is equal to, not equal to, sorry, EU Central one.
104

104

00:04:40.028  -->  00:04:42.690
So this can be confusing, but as you start reading
105

105

00:04:42.690  -->  00:04:45.196
these policies, hopefully that should make a lot more sense.
106

106

00:04:45.196  -->  00:04:47.940
So let's go into these things.
107

107

00:04:47.940  -->  00:04:49.714
So action and action allow deny.
108

108

00:04:49.714  -->  00:04:52.866
So we have this kind of board and it's good to see
109

109

00:04:52.866  -->  00:04:54.672
in the very simple case what's happening.
110

110

00:04:54.672  -->  00:04:59.368
So if we have allow IAM star, we allow IAM, simple.
111

111

00:04:59.368  -->  00:05:03.870
If we have allow NotAction IAM star, then we allow anything
112

112

00:05:03.870  -->  00:05:05.503
but IAM.
113

113

00:05:05.503  -->  00:05:08.346
We have deny IAM star.
114

114

00:05:08.346  -->  00:05:13.290
So that means that we deny IAM and if we have deny IAM star
115

115

00:05:13.290  -->  00:05:15.804
we deny anything that is not IAM.
116

116

00:05:15.804  -->  00:05:17.970
And it's very important for you to understand
117

117

00:05:17.970  -->  00:05:22.260
that an explicit deny and an explicit allow are different.
118

118

00:05:22.260  -->  00:05:25.328
So now let's talk about principle options in IAM policies.
119

119

00:05:25.328  -->  00:05:28.208
So we have the AWS account and the Root User
120

120

00:05:28.208  -->  00:05:30.030
and they have this form.
121

121

00:05:30.030  -->  00:05:34.880
So the principle is AWS this, or the principle is AWS this.
122

122

00:05:34.880  -->  00:05:37.710
They are equivalent, they just represent the account
123

123

00:05:37.710  -->  00:05:38.543
and the Root User.
124

124

00:05:38.543  -->  00:05:42.881
Now for IAM roles, you just have an arn that is equal
125

125

00:05:42.881  -->  00:05:44.310
to a role itself.
126

126

00:05:44.310  -->  00:05:45.660
That's pretty explicit.
127

127

00:05:45.660  -->  00:05:47.310
And then you have role sessions.
128

128

00:05:47.310  -->  00:05:50.910
So this is when you have assumed roles that come from IAM
129

129

00:05:50.910  -->  00:05:53.973
or Cognito identities or SAML providers.
130

130

00:05:54.960  -->  00:05:56.430
You also have IAM users.
131

131

00:05:56.430  -->  00:05:59.659
So IAM users represent an arn of a user.
132

132

00:05:59.659  -->  00:06:04.380
Federated User Sessions where the user says federated user
133

133

00:06:04.380  -->  00:06:06.664
and specific AWS Services.
134

134

00:06:06.664  -->  00:06:09.270
So you'll see principle and then service
135

135

00:06:09.270  -->  00:06:11.190
and then you'll have the name of the service.
136

136

00:06:11.190  -->  00:06:12.090
You usually see those
137

137

00:06:12.090  -->  00:06:14.872
in the trust policies of IAM, for example.
138

138

00:06:14.872  -->  00:06:18.030
And finally, to allow everything we've seen
139

139

00:06:18.030  -->  00:06:22.083
principle star or principle AWS star, these are equivalent.
140

140

00:06:22.083  -->  00:06:25.952
Okay. So that's it for this first part on IAM policies.
141

141

00:06:25.952  -->  00:06:29.373
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
