00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:01,343
<v Instructor>So now let's talk</v>
2

2

00:00:01,343  -->  00:00:04,110
about the AWS Firewall Manager.
3

3

00:00:04,110  -->  00:00:07,530
So this is a service to manage all the firewall rules
4

4

00:00:07,530  -->  00:00:10,680
in all accounts of an AWS organization.
5

5

00:00:10,680  -->  00:00:12,450
So the idea is that you can manage rules
6

6

00:00:12,450  -->  00:00:14,760
across many, many accounts at the same time.
7

7

00:00:14,760  -->  00:00:17,280
So you can set a security policy,
8

8

00:00:17,280  -->  00:00:20,640
and a security policy is a common set of security rules.
9

9

00:00:20,640  -->  00:00:23,370
And so this could be Web Application Firewall rules,
10

10

00:00:23,370  -->  00:00:26,487
so they apply it to the ALB, the API gateways, CloudFronts
11

11

00:00:26,487  -->  00:00:27,600
and so on.
12

12

00:00:27,600  -->  00:00:29,520
Or it could be Shield Advanced rules,
13

13

00:00:29,520  -->  00:00:33,930
so for your ALB, CLB, NLB, the Elastic IP, and CloudFront.
14

14

00:00:33,930  -->  00:00:37,440
It could be security policy to standardize security groups
15

15

00:00:37,440  -->  00:00:39,900
for EC2, your Application Load Balancer,
16

16

00:00:39,900  -->  00:00:42,150
and ENI resources in your VPC.
17

17

00:00:42,150  -->  00:00:43,740
And it could be, as well,
18

18

00:00:43,740  -->  00:00:47,520
rules for your AWS Network Firewall at the VPC level.
19

19

00:00:47,520  -->  00:00:49,290
So this is something we haven't seen yet
20

20

00:00:49,290  -->  00:00:53,010
or your Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall.
21

21

00:00:53,010  -->  00:00:55,560
So the idea is that Firewall Manager allows you
22

22

00:00:55,560  -->  00:00:58,260
to manage all your firewalls in one place.
23

23

00:00:58,260  -->  00:01:02,250
The policies are created at the region level, okay?
24

24

00:01:02,250  -->  00:01:04,890
And then they are applied to all the accounts
25

25

00:01:04,890  -->  00:01:06,870
of your organization.
26

26

00:01:06,870  -->  00:01:07,950
And on top of it,
27

27

00:01:07,950  -->  00:01:10,020
if somehow in your organization, for example,
28

28

00:01:10,020  -->  00:01:13,290
you create a WAF rule for an Application Load Balancer,
29

29

00:01:13,290  -->  00:01:15,330
and somehow there's a new Application Load Balancer
30

30

00:01:15,330  -->  00:01:16,500
being created,
31

31

00:01:16,500  -->  00:01:19,140
then automatically the Firewall Manager
32

32

00:01:19,140  -->  00:01:21,000
is going to apply the same rule
33

33

00:01:21,000  -->  00:01:23,070
to this newly created ALB.
34

34

00:01:23,070  -->  00:01:25,530
That's a feature of Firewall Manager.
35

35

00:01:25,530  -->  00:01:26,363
So you may ask yourself,
36

36

00:01:26,363  -->  00:01:27,810
"Well, what is the difference between WAF
37

37

00:01:27,810  -->  00:01:29,670
and Firewall Manager and Shield?"
38

38

00:01:29,670  -->  00:01:32,040
Well, WAF, Shield, and Firewall Manager
39

39

00:01:32,040  -->  00:01:34,590
are used together for comprehensive protection
40

40

00:01:34,590  -->  00:01:35,790
of your accounts.
41

41

00:01:35,790  -->  00:01:40,110
So first you define your Web ACL rules in WAF.
42

42

00:01:40,110  -->  00:01:44,340
And in case you need one-time protection,
43

43

00:01:44,340  -->  00:01:46,740
then WAF is going to be the right choice for you.
44

44

00:01:46,740  -->  00:01:50,610
But if you want to use WAF across multiple accounts
45

45

00:01:50,610  -->  00:01:52,950
and accelerate WAF configuration
46

46

00:01:52,950  -->  00:01:55,860
and automate the protection of new resources,
47

47

00:01:55,860  -->  00:01:57,870
then you would manage your WAF rules
48

48

00:01:57,870  -->  00:01:59,220
within Firewall Manager.
49

49

00:01:59,220  -->  00:02:01,470
And Firewall Manager will just apply
50

50

00:02:01,470  -->  00:02:03,180
all these rules to all your accounts
51

51

00:02:03,180  -->  00:02:05,850
and all your resources automatically.
52

52

00:02:05,850  -->  00:02:08,040
So now we also have Shield Advanced
53

53

00:02:08,040  -->  00:02:11,250
to help you get protected against DDoS attacks.
54

54

00:02:11,250  -->  00:02:14,460
And it has additional features on top of WAF
55

55

00:02:14,460  -->  00:02:16,380
such as a dedicated support
56

56

00:02:16,380  -->  00:02:18,780
from the Shield Response Team, SRT,
57

57

00:02:18,780  -->  00:02:20,190
advanced reporting,
58

58

00:02:20,190  -->  00:02:24,300
and also, it can automatically create WAF rules for you.
59

59

00:02:24,300  -->  00:02:26,610
And if you're prone to frequent DDoS attacks,
60

60

00:02:26,610  -->  00:02:27,990
then you should definitely consider
61

61

00:02:27,990  -->  00:02:30,600
purchasing Shield Advanced.
62

62

00:02:30,600  -->  00:02:32,310
And so Firewall Manager
63

63

00:02:32,310  -->  00:02:34,710
can also help you deploy Shield Advanced
64

64

00:02:34,710  -->  00:02:36,450
across all your accounts
65

65

00:02:36,450  -->  00:02:39,390
So hopefully the distinction is pretty clear for you now.
66

66

00:02:39,390  -->  00:02:40,380
I hope you liked this lecture,
67

67

00:02:40,380  -->  00:02:42,330
and I will see you in the next lecture.
