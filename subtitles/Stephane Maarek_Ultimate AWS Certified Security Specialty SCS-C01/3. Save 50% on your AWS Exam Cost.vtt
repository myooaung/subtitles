00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.260
So I want to show you a little trick that not many people know.
1

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.100
And that will allow you to save up to 50 percent on your exam cost.
2

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.820
If you have done an exam before.
3

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.500
So in case you have already passed an AWS certification and you go to the benefits tab you can
4

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.430
see a lot of benefits and in there at the very bottom there is an AWS exam discount benefits which gives
5

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.360
you 50 percent discounts on your next exam.
6

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.310
And to claim a benefit you just click on claim benefits.
7

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.230
And what this will do is it will create a code for you and that code you can use to get 50 percent
8

9
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.160
off your next exam.
9

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.220
So let me claim a benefit right now.
10

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.350
And as you can see now the code has been here.
11

12
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.510
So now I need to use this code.
12

13
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.780
So for this let me go back to my metrics and I'm going to schedule a new exam.
13

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.800
I'm going to use PSI and go directly to the exam and we'll just schedule and this works on any exam
14

15
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.940
as far as I can tell.
15

16
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.410
So for example I'll go ahead and book the dev ops exam.
16

17
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.580
So here is my exam.
17

18
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.300
And as you can see it's 270 euros for me.
18

19
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.410
So in the voucher discount coupon I'm going to enter the discount code I got from before.
19

20
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.440
So from the benefits and this token right here.
20

21
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.450
And as you can see now I get 50 percent off.
21

22
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.550
So it became one hundred and thirty five euros afterwards so I just saved one hundred thirty five euros
22

23
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.290
just by doing this little trick.
23

24
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.350
And so many people don't know about this.
24

25
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.900
And so they end up paying more for the exam that what they need.
25

26
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.180
So remember once you pass an exam successfully you will get access to these discount benefits and then
26

27
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.250
use them accordingly on the exam you want to save up to 50 percent on your exam cost.
27

28
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.450
So hopefully I just saved you a lot of money and hopefully that's helpful for you to do more.
28

29
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.590
AWS certifications.
29

30
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.420
So if you liked this tip just let me know and I will see you in the next lecture.
