00:00:00,130  -->  00:00:02,300
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about VPC peering.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,300  -->  00:00:03,960
So the idea is that we can create VPCs
3

3

00:00:03,960  -->  00:00:05,740
and in different regions, different accounts,
4

4

00:00:05,740  -->  00:00:09,500
and we want to connect them together using the AWS network.
5

5

00:00:09,500  -->  00:00:10,640
So to why do we do this?
6

6

00:00:10,640  -->  00:00:12,280
Well, we want to make them behave
7

7

00:00:12,280  -->  00:00:13,900
as if they were in the same network, okay?
8

8

00:00:13,900  -->  00:00:15,170
So it could be very specific.
9

9

00:00:15,170  -->  00:00:17,080
Maybe you could have a BC in other regions,
10

10

00:00:17,080  -->  00:00:17,913
in other accounts,
11

11

00:00:17,913  -->  00:00:19,220
or even within your same accounts
12

12

00:00:19,220  -->  00:00:20,160
and you wanted to connect them.
13

13

00:00:20,160  -->  00:00:22,670
So in order for them not to connect, remember I said,
14

14

00:00:22,670  -->  00:00:24,120
the VPC network CIDRs is,
15

15

00:00:24,120  -->  00:00:26,620
must be distinct from each other because when we connect
16

16

00:00:26,620  -->  00:00:28,680
them together, if they have overlapping centers,
17

17

00:00:28,680  -->  00:00:30,930
they will not be able to communicate.
18

18

00:00:30,930  -->  00:00:34,300
So VPC Peering can happen between two VPCs
19

19

00:00:34,300  -->  00:00:35,920
and they're not transitive.
20

20

00:00:35,920  -->  00:00:38,560
That means that each VPC that wants to communicate
21

21

00:00:38,560  -->  00:00:41,410
with one another must have VPC Peering enabled.
22

22

00:00:41,410  -->  00:00:44,570
So if you have a look at 3D PCs right now, A, B, and C,
23

23

00:00:44,570  -->  00:00:47,320
then we can create a peering connection between A and B
24

24

00:00:47,320  -->  00:00:51,020
and this is allowing you to connect them together.
25

25

00:00:51,020  -->  00:00:54,470
And we can create another peering connection between B and C
26

26

00:00:54,470  -->  00:00:57,050
and again, they can communicate together,
27

27

00:00:57,050  -->  00:01:01,390
but even though A and B and B and C are connected,
28

28

00:01:01,390  -->  00:01:04,480
you still need to enable a VPC Peering connection
29

29

00:01:04,480  -->  00:01:07,130
between A and C to have them communicate.
30

30

00:01:07,130  -->  00:01:09,450
This is very, very, very, very important.
31

31

00:01:09,450  -->  00:01:12,160
Also, when you have VPC Peering,
32

32

00:01:12,160  -->  00:01:14,103
you must enable share sure,
33

33

00:01:15,273  -->  00:01:16,880
but you also need to ability to update the root tables
34

34

00:01:16,880  -->  00:01:19,785
in VPC subnets to ensure that the EC2 instances
35

35

00:01:19,785  -->  00:01:22,140
can communicate with each other
36

36

00:01:22,140  -->  00:01:23,840
and we'll see this in the hands-on.
37

37

00:01:23,840  -->  00:01:26,110
So some good things to know about VPC Peering.
38

38

00:01:26,110  -->  00:01:28,140
They can happen within your own accounts,
39

39

00:01:28,140  -->  00:01:30,160
but they can cross account.
40

40

00:01:30,160  -->  00:01:33,200
So if you want to connect a VPC from one accounts
41

41

00:01:33,200  -->  00:01:35,660
A to account B, you could, and also cross regions.
42

42

00:01:35,660  -->  00:01:37,520
So this is very, very powerful.
43

43

00:01:37,520  -->  00:01:39,430
And you remember security groups.
44

44

00:01:39,430  -->  00:01:41,980
We can reference other security groups in it
45

45

00:01:41,980  -->  00:01:44,350
while it's possible to also reference a security group
46

46

00:01:44,350  -->  00:01:48,250
from appeared VBC across accounts in the same region.
47

47

00:01:48,250  -->  00:01:50,330
And this is very powerful because we don't need to have
48

48

00:01:50,330  -->  00:01:51,780
the source as a CIDR or an IP,
49

49

00:01:51,780  -->  00:01:53,840
we can also reference a security group.
50

50

00:01:53,840  -->  00:01:55,320
Extremely powerful.
51

51

00:01:55,320  -->  00:01:57,240
So back into our networking diagram,
52

52

00:01:57,240  -->  00:01:58,277
we're here and now we're going to add
53

53

00:01:58,277  -->  00:02:02,500
a VPC Peering connection to connect our VPC to other VPCs.
54

54

00:02:02,500  -->  00:02:04,950
So that's it, I will see you in the next lecture.
