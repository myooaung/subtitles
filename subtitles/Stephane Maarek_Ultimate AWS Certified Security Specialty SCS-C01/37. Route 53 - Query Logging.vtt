00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:02.160
<v Teacher>So, now let's talk about query logging</v>
2

2

00:00:02.160  -->  00:00:04.020
for Route 53.
3

3

00:00:04.020  -->  00:00:06.780
So, the first one is DNS query logging,
4

4

00:00:06.780  -->  00:00:08.880
which is going to give you information
5

5

00:00:08.880  -->  00:00:11.070
about public DNS queries
6

6

00:00:11.070  -->  00:00:13.800
that the Route 53 Resolver receives.
7

7

00:00:13.800  -->  00:00:16.920
So, this is applicable only to public hosted zones
8

8

00:00:16.920  -->  00:00:20.250
and then the logs are sent only to CloudWatch.
9

9

00:00:20.250  -->  00:00:23.850
So, this is the kind of request you will see in the logs.
10

10

00:00:23.850  -->  00:00:27.060
You have the log format version, the query timestamp,
11

11

00:00:27.060  -->  00:00:29.970
the hosted zone ID for your public hosted zone,
12

12

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:33.390
the query name, the query type, the response code,
13

13

00:00:33.390  -->  00:00:36.570
the query protocol, the edge locations are responded,
14

14

00:00:36.570  -->  00:00:41.570
the Resolver IP address, and the EDNS client subnets.
15

15

00:00:41.610  -->  00:00:43.620
The other kind of query logging you have
16

16

00:00:43.620  -->  00:00:45.630
is the Resolver query logging
17

17

00:00:45.630  -->  00:00:48.450
which is going to log all DNS queries made
18

18

00:00:48.450  -->  00:00:49.860
within your VPC.
19

19

00:00:49.860  -->  00:00:52.410
For example, by your EC2 instances,
20

20

00:00:52.410  -->  00:00:54.300
your Lambda functions, and so on.
21

21

00:00:54.300  -->  00:00:56.400
Also, from on-premise resources that are going
22

22

00:00:56.400  -->  00:00:59.790
to be leveraging the Resolver inbound endpoints,
23

23

00:00:59.790  -->  00:01:03.330
and also anything leveraging the Resolver outbound points.
24

24

00:01:03.330  -->  00:01:07.530
And finally, whatever is using the Resolver DNS firewall.
25

25

00:01:07.530  -->  00:01:08.910
So, let's take an example.
26

26

00:01:08.910  -->  00:01:13.140
We have the Route 53 Resolver and our VPC.
27

27

00:01:13.140  -->  00:01:16.680
We have an EC2 instance that makes a query to example.com.
28

28

00:01:16.680  -->  00:01:19.380
Then this is going to be automatically logged
29

29

00:01:19.380  -->  00:01:21.330
through the Resolver query logging,
30

30

00:01:21.330  -->  00:01:24.240
and then these logs can be sent to three destinations.
31

31

00:01:24.240  -->  00:01:26.790
It could be S3 buckets, CloudWatch Logs,
32

32

00:01:26.790  -->  00:01:29.190
and Kinesis Data Firehose.
33

33

00:01:29.190  -->  00:01:32.580
Now these configurations of query logging can be shared
34

34

00:01:32.580  -->  00:01:36.750
with other accounts using AWS Resource Access Manager,
35

35

00:01:36.750  -->  00:01:39.120
which is called AWS RAM.
36

36

00:01:39.120  -->  00:01:41.370
So, what does the Resolver query logging look like?
37

37

00:01:41.370  -->  00:01:43.200
Well, it's a JSON document
38

38

00:01:43.200  -->  00:01:45.240
which gives you a lot of information such as
39

39

00:01:45.240  -->  00:01:49.563
the VPC the request was made, the type of query, and so on.
40

40

00:01:50.580  -->  00:01:52.980
So, what kind of architectures can we build
41

41

00:01:52.980  -->  00:01:55.230
with the Resolver query logging?
42

42

00:01:55.230  -->  00:01:56.063
Well, for example
43

43

00:01:56.063  -->  00:01:59.130
all the DNS logs can be sent into CloudWatch Logs,
44

44

00:01:59.130  -->  00:02:01.320
from which we can use CloudWatch Logs insights
45

45

00:02:01.320  -->  00:02:03.060
to find specific data.
46

46

00:02:03.060  -->  00:02:05.790
Or we can use CloudWatch Contributor insights
47

47

00:02:05.790  -->  00:02:08.550
to find the most common DNS queries
48

48

00:02:08.550  -->  00:02:10.140
amongst our CloudWatch logs
49

49

00:02:10.140  -->  00:02:12.480
and try to understand whether or not we're being attacked,
50

50

00:02:12.480  -->  00:02:13.710
for example.
51

51

00:02:13.710  -->  00:02:15.150
Alright, that's it for this lecture.
52

52

00:02:15.150  -->  00:02:16.230
I hope you liked it,
53

53

00:02:16.230  -->  00:02:18.180
and I will see you in the next lecture.
