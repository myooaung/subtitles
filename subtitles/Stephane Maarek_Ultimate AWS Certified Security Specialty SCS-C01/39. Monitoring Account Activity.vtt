00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:02.610
<v Instructor>So let's take the example of monitoring</v>
2

2

00:00:02.610  -->  00:00:03.870
account activity
3

3

00:00:03.870  -->  00:00:07.140
and see how different services relate to that simple task.
4

4

00:00:07.140  -->  00:00:09.120
Because based on some requirements
5

5

00:00:09.120  -->  00:00:10.290
you may have different services.
6

6

00:00:10.290  -->  00:00:11.190
So first of all
7

7

00:00:11.190  -->  00:00:14.190
if you wanted to have the configuration history
8

8

00:00:14.190  -->  00:00:19.050
you must enable AWS config with a configuration recorder on
9

9

00:00:19.050  -->  00:00:21.180
and that gives you all the configuration
10

10

00:00:21.180  -->  00:00:23.400
of all your resources over time.
11

11

00:00:23.400  -->  00:00:26.160
Then if you look at API history
12

12

00:00:26.160  -->  00:00:28.800
you must look into CloudTrail and CloudTrail
13

13

00:00:28.800  -->  00:00:31.200
Event history is going to give you the API history
14

14

00:00:31.200  -->  00:00:33.930
for the past 90 days from which you can filter
15

15

00:00:33.930  -->  00:00:36.570
by resource name, resource type, event name
16

16

00:00:36.570  -->  00:00:38.580
or even by IAM user
17

17

00:00:38.580  -->  00:00:41.790
or assumed IAM role session name or access key
18

18

00:00:41.790  -->  00:00:42.843
if you needed to.
19

19

00:00:44.100  -->  00:00:46.440
Then using CloudWatch Logs insights
20

20

00:00:46.440  -->  00:00:49.860
you have the ability to stream all these API calls
21

21

00:00:49.860  -->  00:00:51.540
from CloudTrail into CloudWatch logs.
22

22

00:00:51.540  -->  00:00:52.373
You can store them
23

23

00:00:52.373  -->  00:00:54.900
for as long as you want in CloudWatch logs.
24

24

00:00:54.900  -->  00:00:57.858
And thanks to Logs Insights, you can search the API history
25

25

00:00:57.858  -->  00:00:59.970
beyond the past 90 days that the
26

26

00:00:59.970  -->  00:01:02.310
CloudTrail console provides.
27

27

00:01:02.310  -->  00:01:03.300
So for this, of course
28

28

00:01:03.300  -->  00:01:05.314
make sure your trail is sending actual data
29

29

00:01:05.314  -->  00:01:07.350
to CloudWatch logs.
30

30

00:01:07.350  -->  00:01:09.660
And finally, you can also use Athena.
31

31

00:01:09.660  -->  00:01:12.586
So Athena has the ability to also help you look
32

32

00:01:12.586  -->  00:01:15.780
at API history beyond the past 90 days
33

33

00:01:15.780  -->  00:01:19.020
but also perform more advanced queries, some statistics
34

34

00:01:19.020  -->  00:01:20.730
some sums and so on.
35

35

00:01:20.730  -->  00:01:22.020
So hopefully that makes sense.
36

36

00:01:22.020  -->  00:01:25.020
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
