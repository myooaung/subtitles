00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:01.530
<v Instructor>So here is a short lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01.530  -->  00:00:03.420
on the IAM credentials report.
3

3

00:00:03.420  -->  00:00:06.030
So this report gives you the IAM users
4

4

00:00:06.030  -->  00:00:08.940
and the status of their password, their access keys,
5

5

00:00:08.940  -->  00:00:10.290
and their MFA device.
6

6

00:00:10.290  -->  00:00:13.440
It's just a CSV document that you can download
7

7

00:00:13.440  -->  00:00:17.370
using the IAM Console, the API, the CLI, or the SDK,
8

8

00:00:17.370  -->  00:00:20.760
and it's going to help you in auditing and compliance.
9

9

00:00:20.760  -->  00:00:22.320
It's going to be generated as often
10

10

00:00:22.320  -->  00:00:25.560
as once every four hours, and you need to do an API call
11

11

00:00:25.560  -->  00:00:28.500
to actually retrieve the content of that file.
12

12

00:00:28.500  -->  00:00:30.540
So this is something you should know about,
13

13

00:00:30.540  -->  00:00:32.730
but there is a better way to do things
14

14

00:00:32.730  -->  00:00:35.880
if you want to manage aged access keys.
15

15

00:00:35.880  -->  00:00:38.469
So let's say, for example, that you want to detect
16

16

00:00:38.469  -->  00:00:41.370
whenever an access key is going to be old.
17

17

00:00:41.370  -->  00:00:44.550
What you can do is that you can set up AWS Config,
18

18

00:00:44.550  -->  00:00:48.450
with the access-key-rotated rule, to be triggered for keys
19

19

00:00:48.450  -->  00:00:51.180
that are over 90 days old.
20

20

00:00:51.180  -->  00:00:54.690
And then from this, you can trigger an SSM automation
21

21

00:00:54.690  -->  00:00:58.290
to actually rotate these access keys, for example,
22

22

00:00:58.290  -->  00:01:01.560
and then send a notification to Jira, Slack or API endpoints
23

23

00:01:01.560  -->  00:01:03.300
or notifications into an SNS topic
24

24

00:01:03.300  -->  00:01:05.880
for a master security account that you have.
25

25

00:01:05.880  -->  00:01:08.250
So the exam may ask you, "Do you prefer Config
26

26

00:01:08.250  -->  00:01:12.570
or do you prefer the IAM credentials report to automate,
27

27

00:01:12.570  -->  00:01:15.390
you know, rotating and alerting on old keys?"
28

28

00:01:15.390  -->  00:01:17.700
Well, the answer is absolutely use Config,
29

29

00:01:17.700  -->  00:01:21.420
but still you should know about the IAM credentials report.
30

30

00:01:21.420  -->  00:01:22.260
All right, that's it.
31

31

00:01:22.260  -->  00:01:25.383
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
