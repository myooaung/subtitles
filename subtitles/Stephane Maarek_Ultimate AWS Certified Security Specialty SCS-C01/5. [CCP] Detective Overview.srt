00:00:00,320  -->  00:00:01,940
<v Instructor>Okay, so very short lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01,940  -->  00:00:03,510
on Amazon Detective.
3

3

00:00:03,510  -->  00:00:05,880
So, when you have all these services
4

4

00:00:05,880  -->  00:00:08,670
such as GuardDuty, Macie, and Security Hub
5

5

00:00:08,670  -->  00:00:11,040
that are used to identify potential security issues
6

6

00:00:11,040  -->  00:00:14,580
or findings, you need to find how these happen
7

7

00:00:14,580  -->  00:00:15,770
and get to the root cause.
8

8

00:00:15,770  -->  00:00:18,630
And so, sometimes the deeper analysis to isolate
9

9

00:00:18,630  -->  00:00:20,930
the root cause can be long and complicated.
10

10

00:00:20,930  -->  00:00:23,130
It's a complex process to analyze data
11

11

00:00:23,130  -->  00:00:25,480
from different places and link it together.
12

12

00:00:25,480  -->  00:00:26,400
It could be quite long
13

13

00:00:26,400  -->  00:00:28,440
and when you're dealing with security,
14

14

00:00:28,440  -->  00:00:30,700
you want to get to the root cause as quickly as possible
15

15

00:00:30,700  -->  00:00:33,980
because there may be a security hole in your architecture.
16

16

00:00:33,980  -->  00:00:36,340
And so, this is the purpose of Amazon Detective.
17

17

00:00:36,340  -->  00:00:37,660
The name is quite explicit.
18

18

00:00:37,660  -->  00:00:40,070
Detective is going to analyze, investigate,
19

19

00:00:40,070  -->  00:00:43,010
and quickly identify the root cause of security issues
20

20

00:00:43,010  -->  00:00:46,470
or suspicious activities using machine learning
21

21

00:00:46,470  -->  00:00:48,720
and graphs in the backend to really allow you
22

22

00:00:48,720  -->  00:00:52,450
to quickly get down to where the issue is coming from.
23

23

00:00:52,450  -->  00:00:54,540
And to do so, it's going to automatically collect
24

24

00:00:54,540  -->  00:00:57,190
and process events from your VPC Flow Logs,
25

25

00:00:57,190  -->  00:00:59,450
your CloudTrail trails, and GuardDuty
26

26

00:00:59,450  -->  00:01:01,450
to create this unified view.
27

27

00:01:01,450  -->  00:01:03,500
And it will, in turn, give you visualizations
28

28

00:01:03,500  -->  00:01:06,520
with details and context, so you can get to the root cause.
29

29

00:01:06,520  -->  00:01:07,353
So that's it.
30

30

00:01:07,353  -->  00:01:09,863
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
