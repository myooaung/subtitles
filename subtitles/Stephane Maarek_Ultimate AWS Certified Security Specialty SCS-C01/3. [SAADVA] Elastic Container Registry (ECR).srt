00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,990
<v Narrator>Okay, so let's do a short intro</v>
2

2

00:00:01,990  -->  00:00:03,150
to Amazon ECR.
3

3

00:00:03,150  -->  00:00:04,590
So Amazon ECR stands
4

4

00:00:04,590  -->  00:00:06,880
for Elastic Container Registry,
5

5

00:00:06,880  -->  00:00:07,830
and it's used to store
6

6

00:00:07,830  -->  00:00:10,820
and manage Docker images on AWS.
7

7

00:00:10,820  -->  00:00:13,090
So so far, we've been using online repository
8

8

00:00:13,090  -->  00:00:14,120
such as Docker hub
9

9

00:00:14,120  -->  00:00:16,100
but we can also store our own images
10

10

00:00:16,100  -->  00:00:17,520
on Amazon ECR.
11

11

00:00:17,520  -->  00:00:19,360
And actually you have two options for ECR.
12

12

00:00:19,360  -->  00:00:21,110
We can store images privately,
13

13

00:00:21,110  -->  00:00:22,480
just for your account
14

14

00:00:22,480  -->  00:00:23,930
or your own accounts
15

15

00:00:23,930  -->  00:00:25,040
with an s
16

16

00:00:25,040  -->  00:00:28,020
or you can use a public repository and publish
17

17

00:00:28,020  -->  00:00:31,250
to the Amazon ECR public gallery.
18

18

00:00:31,250  -->  00:00:33,150
Now ECR is fully integrated
19

19

00:00:33,150  -->  00:00:33,983
with Amazon ECS,
20

20

00:00:33,983  -->  00:00:34,816
which is great.
21

21

00:00:34,816  -->  00:00:35,920
And your images
22

22

00:00:35,920  -->  00:00:37,380
are behind the scenes stored
23

23

00:00:37,380  -->  00:00:39,080
by Amazon S3.
24

24

00:00:39,080  -->  00:00:40,180
So your ECR repository
25

25

00:00:40,180  -->  00:00:42,120
may contain different Docker images
26

26

00:00:42,120  -->  00:00:43,530
and then your ECS cluster.
27

27

00:00:43,530  -->  00:00:44,363
And for example,
28

28

00:00:44,363  -->  00:00:45,370
an EC2 instance
29

29

00:00:45,370  -->  00:00:47,360
on your ECS cluster may want
30

30

00:00:47,360  -->  00:00:49,140
to pull these images.
31

31

00:00:49,140  -->  00:00:50,090
So to do so
32

32

00:00:50,090  -->  00:00:50,923
while we're going
33

33

00:00:50,923  -->  00:00:52,130
to sign an IAM role
34

34

00:00:52,130  -->  00:00:53,670
to our EC2 instance
35

35

00:00:53,670  -->  00:00:55,940
and this IAM role will allow our instance
36

36

00:00:55,940  -->  00:00:57,580
to pull Docker images.
37

37

00:00:57,580  -->  00:00:59,370
So of course, all access
38

38

00:00:59,370  -->  00:01:01,860
to ECR is protected by IAM.
39

39

00:01:01,860  -->  00:01:03,930
That includes that if you have a permission error
40

40

00:01:03,930  -->  00:01:05,530
on ECR have a look
41

41

00:01:05,530  -->  00:01:06,680
at your policies
42

42

00:01:06,680  -->  00:01:07,770
and then your
43

43

00:01:07,770  -->  00:01:08,603
containers are going
44

44

00:01:08,603  -->  00:01:09,436
to be started
45

45

00:01:09,436  -->  00:01:10,900
on your EC2 instance
46

46

00:01:10,900  -->  00:01:12,360
after they are pulled
47

47

00:01:12,360  -->  00:01:13,770
by your EC2 instance.
48

48

00:01:13,770  -->  00:01:15,480
And this is how ECS
49

49

00:01:15,480  -->  00:01:18,580
and ECR ECR work together.
50

50

00:01:18,580  -->  00:01:19,720
Now, Amazon ECR is great
51

51

00:01:19,720  -->  00:01:20,553
because on top
52

52

00:01:20,553  -->  00:01:22,080
of being a repository,
53

53

00:01:22,080  -->  00:01:24,080
it, supports image vulnerability
54

54

00:01:24,080  -->  00:01:26,730
scanning, versioning, image tags,
55

55

00:01:26,730  -->  00:01:28,830
and image lifecycle.
56

56

00:01:28,830  -->  00:01:29,951
So overall, anytime you see
57

57

00:01:29,951  -->  00:01:32,750
storing Docker images think ECR
58

58

00:01:32,750  -->  00:01:33,583
and that should be it
59

59

00:01:33,583  -->  00:01:34,940
for you at the exam.
60

60

00:01:34,940  -->  00:01:35,773
All right.
61

61

00:01:35,773  -->  00:01:36,606
I hope you liked it.
62

62

00:01:36,606  -->  00:01:37,439
And I will see you
63

63

00:01:37,439  -->  00:01:38,330
in the next lecture.
