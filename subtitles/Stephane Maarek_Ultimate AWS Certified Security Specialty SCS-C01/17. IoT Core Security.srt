00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:02,820
<v Lecturer>So now let's talk about IoT Core Security.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,820  -->  00:00:05,730
So say you have IoT Core and an IoT Thing.
3

3

00:00:05,730  -->  00:00:09,030
The IoT Thing is going to connect using the MQTT protocol
4

4

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:10,860
to your core control plane
5

5

00:00:10,860  -->  00:00:13,530
and it will pass in a client's ID.
6

6

00:00:13,530  -->  00:00:16,770
Now out of it we will have an IoT certificate,
7

7

00:00:16,770  -->  00:00:17,730
we'll have a thing name
8

8

00:00:17,730  -->  00:00:20,130
so we can identify which IoT device it is
9

9

00:00:20,130  -->  00:00:23,790
and we can attach an IoT Core Policy that looks like this.
10

10

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:27,570
And the core policy may allow our thing name to connect.
11

11

00:00:27,570  -->  00:00:31,110
So here we have to match everything together using variables
12

12

00:00:31,110  -->  00:00:32,760
and I'll talk about it right now.
13

13

00:00:33,600  -->  00:00:36,030
So first, the IoT Core Policy.
14

14

00:00:36,030  -->  00:00:37,620
So it's a JSON documents
15

15

00:00:37,620  -->  00:00:39,540
and this allows you to control access
16

16

00:00:39,540  -->  00:00:41,460
to the IoT Core control plane.
17

17

00:00:41,460  -->  00:00:44,400
So this is for your IoT Core message broker
18

18

00:00:44,400  -->  00:00:48,270
to receive and send MQTT messages and so on.
19

19

00:00:48,270  -->  00:00:50,550
And you attach it to the IoT certificates
20

20

00:00:50,550  -->  00:00:53,190
or according to identity of your IoT Thing.
21

21

00:00:53,190  -->  00:00:55,020
So the IoT Thing will have a certificates
22

22

00:00:55,020  -->  00:00:56,760
and then it will have a core policy
23

23

00:00:56,760  -->  00:00:58,500
attached to the certificates.
24

24

00:00:58,500  -->  00:01:00,270
So thanks to this the certificate
25

25

00:01:00,270  -->  00:01:02,790
we get authentication of the IoT Thing
26

26

00:01:02,790  -->  00:01:06,600
and the core policy defines authorization of the IoT Thing.
27

27

00:01:06,600  -->  00:01:07,770
And we can for example,
28

28

00:01:07,770  -->  00:01:09,300
say that we want to access,
29

29

00:01:09,300  -->  00:01:12,600
to allow our IoT Thing to access all MQTT topics
30

30

00:01:12,600  -->  00:01:15,420
or restrict access to a single topic.
31

31

00:01:15,420  -->  00:01:18,270
So once the IoT Thing is identified
32

32

00:01:18,270  -->  00:01:20,280
with IoT Core using the IoT Certificate
33

33

00:01:20,280  -->  00:01:23,460
and has authorization using the IoT Core policy,
34

34

00:01:23,460  -->  00:01:27,000
we can define it in a scalable way
35

35

00:01:27,000  -->  00:01:29,280
by using the IoT Thing policy variable.
36

36

00:01:29,280  -->  00:01:30,720
And that can come up in the exam.
37

37

00:01:30,720  -->  00:01:33,420
So the idea is that in your policy,
38

38

00:01:33,420  -->  00:01:35,910
and you can look at the bottom right of this slide,
39

39

00:01:35,910  -->  00:01:39,300
in this policy, you can include the thing name
40

40

00:01:39,300  -->  00:01:42,210
to have conditional policy variables.
41

41

00:01:42,210  -->  00:01:44,940
And this allows you to have permissions
42

42

00:01:44,940  -->  00:01:47,130
based on the IoT Thing properties
43

43

00:01:47,130  -->  00:01:49,110
such as its name, its type
44

44

00:01:49,110  -->  00:01:51,030
and some attribute value.
45

45

00:01:51,030  -->  00:01:53,430
And then at runtime is going to be replaced
46

46

00:01:53,430  -->  00:01:57,990
by when the IoT Thing connects to the AWS IoT Service.
47

47

00:01:57,990  -->  00:02:00,060
This seems complicated, but the idea is
48

48

00:02:00,060  -->  00:02:02,550
if a Thing connects to the IoT Core
49

49

00:02:02,550  -->  00:02:06,450
using a Core policy and IoT Thing policy variables,
50

50

00:02:06,450  -->  00:02:09,030
you can control what this thing has access to,
51

51

00:02:09,030  -->  00:02:11,970
based on its name or its type and so on.
52

52

00:02:11,970  -->  00:02:13,560
So hopefully that makes sense.
53

53

00:02:13,560  -->  00:02:15,930
This can come up in one question at the exam.
54

54

00:02:15,930  -->  00:02:17,370
It's a very easy one,
55

55

00:02:17,370  -->  00:02:18,360
once you know this.
56

56

00:02:18,360  -->  00:02:20,040
So hopefully you like this lecture
57

57

00:02:20,040  -->  00:02:22,143
and I will see you in the next lecture.
