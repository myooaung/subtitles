00:00:00.240  -->  00:00:02.010
<v Instructor>So let's talk about a few Use Cases</v>
2

2

00:00:02.010  -->  00:00:04.410
for Config that can appear in the exam.
3

3

00:00:04.410  -->  00:00:06.990
The first one is to audit IAM policies,
4

4

00:00:06.990  -->  00:00:09.720
and making sure that they are fully compliant,
5

5

00:00:09.720  -->  00:00:11.490
and that they don't give, for example,
6

6

00:00:11.490  -->  00:00:13.920
too much permissions to your users.
7

7

00:00:13.920  -->  00:00:15.420
The second one is to detect
8

8

00:00:15.420  -->  00:00:17.580
whether or not CloudTrail has been disabled,
9

9

00:00:17.580  -->  00:00:19.170
it's very important.
10

10

00:00:19.170  -->  00:00:21.870
You can also detect if EC2 instances are created
11

11

00:00:21.870  -->  00:00:23.820
with unapproved AMIs.
12

12

00:00:23.820  -->  00:00:27.060
You can detect if Security Groups are open to the public.
13

13

00:00:27.060  -->  00:00:29.520
You can detect if Internet Gateways are added
14

14

00:00:29.520  -->  00:00:32.700
to unauthorized VPC, so that your VPC that are
15

15

00:00:32.700  -->  00:00:35.580
supposed to remain private will remain private.
16

16

00:00:35.580  -->  00:00:39.270
You can detect if your EBS volumes are encrypted or not,
17

17

00:00:39.270  -->  00:00:42.420
and if your RDS databases are made public.
18

18

00:00:42.420  -->  00:00:45.360
So, let's talk about some automation for AWS Config.
19

19

00:00:45.360  -->  00:00:48.120
So, let's talk about expired IAM Keys.
20

20

00:00:48.120  -->  00:00:51.480
So with Config, for example, you can define a rule
21

21

00:00:51.480  -->  00:00:53.550
to detect whether or not IAM keys are expired,
22

22

00:00:53.550  -->  00:00:55.320
it's called Access-Keys-Rotated.
23

23

00:00:55.320  -->  00:00:57.870
And in case something is non-compliant,
24

24

00:00:57.870  -->  00:01:00.030
this will trigger Amazon EventBridge,
25

25

00:01:00.030  -->  00:01:02.130
which can in turn invoke a Lambda function
26

26

00:01:02.130  -->  00:01:04.680
to actually rotate these Access Keys,
27

27

00:01:04.680  -->  00:01:07.590
or an SNS topic to notify the users,
28

28

00:01:07.590  -->  00:01:10.260
or even to rotate Access Keys if you wanted to
29

29

00:01:10.260  -->  00:01:13.260
hook your Lambda function to that SNS topic.
30

30

00:01:13.260  -->  00:01:15.210
Another option, as you know for Config,
31

31

00:01:15.210  -->  00:01:19.710
is to use Automated Remediations through SSM Automation.
32

32

00:01:19.710  -->  00:01:22.830
So in case Config is detected to be non-compliant,
33

33

00:01:22.830  -->  00:01:25.770
we can automatically trigger an SSM Automation,
34

34

00:01:25.770  -->  00:01:29.310
which will, for example, rotate our Access Keys.
35

35

00:01:29.310  -->  00:01:31.800
Alright, that's it for Config, I hope you liked it.
36

36

00:01:31.800  -->  00:01:33.750
And I will see you in the next lecture.
