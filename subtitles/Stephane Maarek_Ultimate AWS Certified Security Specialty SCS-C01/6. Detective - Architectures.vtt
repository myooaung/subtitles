00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:02.280
<v ->So here is an example architecture</v>
2

2

00:00:02.280  -->  00:00:05.340
that can come up in the exam for Amazon Detective.
3

3

00:00:05.340  -->  00:00:08.640
So say for example, we have Detective and also GuardDuty
4

4

00:00:08.640  -->  00:00:11.160
and we want to be able to understand
5

5

00:00:11.160  -->  00:00:13.800
how and why CloudTrail would be disabled.
6

6

00:00:13.800  -->  00:00:17.070
So for example, someone goes in and disables CloudTrail.
7

7

00:00:17.070  -->  00:00:19.740
So GuardDuty can generate a finding for it
8

8

00:00:19.740  -->  00:00:21.900
and any findings of GuardDuty
9

9

00:00:21.900  -->  00:00:24.720
will end up into Amazon Detective.
10

10

00:00:24.720  -->  00:00:27.000
So from there, we can use Detective
11

11

00:00:27.000  -->  00:00:28.650
and its machine learning capability
12

12

00:00:28.650  -->  00:00:30.960
to figure out what happens and actually, you know,
13

13

00:00:30.960  -->  00:00:33.120
do triage to determine whether or not
14

14

00:00:33.120  -->  00:00:35.580
this is a true positive or a false positive.
15

15

00:00:35.580  -->  00:00:38.820
Then scoping to figure out what systems are compromised
16

16

00:00:38.820  -->  00:00:41.460
what users are compromised, where is attack from,
17

17

00:00:41.460  -->  00:00:43.800
so who disabled it and from where
18

18

00:00:43.800  -->  00:00:45.360
and how long has it been happening?
19

19

00:00:45.360  -->  00:00:47.730
And then do the response to stop the attack,
20

20

00:00:47.730  -->  00:00:51.390
so to re-enable CloudTrail to minimize the damage
21

21

00:00:51.390  -->  00:00:53.190
or to prevent similar attacks.
22

22

00:00:53.190  -->  00:00:55.140
So Detective is the place where you can do
23

23

00:00:55.140  -->  00:00:57.690
all this investigation in response
24

24

00:00:57.690  -->  00:01:01.800
to a finding being happening in GuardDuty.
25

25

00:01:01.800  -->  00:01:04.680
So that's it, it was a quick one, but I hope you liked it
26

26

00:01:04.680  -->  00:01:06.630
and I will see you in the next lecture.
