00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:01,260
<v Instructor>So I know you've just seen</v>
2

2

00:00:01,260  -->  00:00:02,940
S3 encryption in detail.
3

3

00:00:02,940  -->  00:00:04,890
I'm just going to give you a summary
4

4

00:00:04,890  -->  00:00:07,320
with one bit of information you need to know.
5

5

00:00:07,320  -->  00:00:10,260
So we've seen SSE-S3 is to encrypt S3 objects
6

6

00:00:10,260  -->  00:00:12,930
using keys handled and managed by AWS.
7

7

00:00:12,930  -->  00:00:15,750
We've seen SSE-KMS where we use KMS
8

8

00:00:15,750  -->  00:00:17,460
to manage encryption keys.
9

9

00:00:17,460  -->  00:00:21,210
So the benefits that the key usage appears in CloudTrail.
10

10

00:00:21,210  -->  00:00:22,470
But the thing I haven't told you
11

11

00:00:22,470  -->  00:00:24,690
in the previous lecture that I'm telling you right now
12

12

00:00:24,690  -->  00:00:28,020
is that the objects, even if you make them public,
13

13

00:00:28,020  -->  00:00:30,990
they can never be read by anonymous users
14

14

00:00:30,990  -->  00:00:34,890
because they do not have access to the underlying KMS keys.
15

15

00:00:34,890  -->  00:00:38,640
Whereas an objects encrypted with SSE-S3 made public
16

16

00:00:38,640  -->  00:00:41,670
can be accessed by anonymous user.
17

17

00:00:41,670  -->  00:00:44,430
So also, when you do s3:PutObject,
18

18

00:00:44,430  -->  00:00:45,480
you need to make sure you have
19

19

00:00:45,480  -->  00:00:47,940
the kms:GenerateDataKey permission
20

20

00:00:47,940  -->  00:00:50,310
because well, you need to generate a data key
21

21

00:00:50,310  -->  00:00:54,390
to encrypt a large file in Amazon S3.
22

22

00:00:54,390  -->  00:00:55,800
When you use SSE-C,
23

23

00:00:55,800  -->  00:00:58,830
this is when you want to manage your own encryption keys
24

24

00:00:58,830  -->  00:01:00,840
for server-side encryption.
25

25

00:01:00,840  -->  00:01:03,840
Then we have the option of client-side encryption.
26

26

00:01:03,840  -->  00:01:05,580
And finally, if you use Glacier,
27

27

00:01:05,580  -->  00:01:09,300
all data is going to be encrypted with AES-256
28

28

00:01:09,300  -->  00:01:12,330
and the key will be under AWS control.
29

29

00:01:12,330  -->  00:01:13,860
All right, that's it for this summary lecture.
30

30

00:01:13,860  -->  00:01:16,953
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
