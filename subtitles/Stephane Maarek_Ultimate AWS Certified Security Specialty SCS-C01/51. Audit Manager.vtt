00:00:00.300  -->  00:00:01.133
<v Instructor>So let's talk about</v>
2

2

00:00:01.133  -->  00:00:03.450
the AWS Audit Manager Service.
3

3

00:00:03.450  -->  00:00:06.660
So this is a service to help you assess risk and compliance
4

4

00:00:06.660  -->  00:00:10.410
of your AWS workloads and to continuously audit
5

5

00:00:10.410  -->  00:00:13.170
your service's usage and prepare for audits.
6

6

00:00:13.170  -->  00:00:17.100
So if your company is getting an audit
7

7

00:00:17.100  -->  00:00:20.460
because you are preparing for the framework
8

8

00:00:20.460  -->  00:00:24.600
such as the GDPR or the Health Insurance Portability
9

9

00:00:24.600  -->  00:00:28.260
and Accountability Act, HIPAA, or the PCI compliance
10

10

00:00:28.260  -->  00:00:31.230
or the SOC 2 Control and so on,
11

11

00:00:31.230  -->  00:00:33.360
you need to gather a lot of evidence,
12

12

00:00:33.360  -->  00:00:36.420
you need to gather a lot of compliance reports
13

13

00:00:36.420  -->  00:00:39.210
and provide this as evidence when you submit
14

14

00:00:39.210  -->  00:00:41.310
to get certified in these things.
15

15

00:00:41.310  -->  00:00:43.950
And this is where Audit Manager is going to help you.
16

16

00:00:43.950  -->  00:00:47.160
So it's going to look at the framework you want to include
17

17

00:00:47.160  -->  00:00:49.440
in your assessment, and then for it
18

18

00:00:49.440  -->  00:00:51.870
it's going to generate reports of compliance
19

19

00:00:51.870  -->  00:00:55.470
for all your resources alongside evidence folders.
20

20

00:00:55.470  -->  00:00:57.660
And of course, if something is not compliant,
21

21

00:00:57.660  -->  00:00:59.160
then you will tell you
22

22

00:00:59.160  -->  00:01:01.680
and you will have action items to resolve them.
23

23

00:01:01.680  -->  00:01:03.750
So this is continuous and that's the power of it.
24

24

00:01:03.750  -->  00:01:08.490
As your organization grows and your activity continues,
25

25

00:01:08.490  -->  00:01:11.730
you will know whether or not you are still auditable
26

26

00:01:11.730  -->  00:01:14.880
and you are still compliant with some frameworks.
27

27

00:01:14.880  -->  00:01:17.940
So this has deep integration with Security Hub,
28

28

00:01:17.940  -->  00:01:22.440
Config, Control Tower, CloudTrail, and License Manager.
29

29

00:01:22.440  -->  00:01:24.870
And this can be run over multi-accounts
30

30

00:01:24.870  -->  00:01:28.650
via the integration with AWS organizations.
31

31

00:01:28.650  -->  00:01:30.840
So to summarize, for Audit Manager,
32

32

00:01:30.840  -->  00:01:33.390
this helps you continuously audit your usage
33

33

00:01:33.390  -->  00:01:35.880
to simplify how you assess risk and compliance
34

34

00:01:35.880  -->  00:01:38.160
and make sure you can get past some frameworks.
35

35

00:01:38.160  -->  00:01:40.500
So you select the frameworks you want,
36

36

00:01:40.500  -->  00:01:41.670
then you define the scope,
37

37

00:01:41.670  -->  00:01:45.300
so which accounts and regions and services you want,
38

38

00:01:45.300  -->  00:01:47.910
then you're going to get automated evidence collection.
39

39

00:01:47.910  -->  00:01:50.010
So continuously gathering evidence
40

40

00:01:50.010  -->  00:01:51.570
across all your resources
41

41

00:01:51.570  -->  00:01:53.910
and then you can look at control reviews
42

42

00:01:53.910  -->  00:01:55.530
or you can delegate your resource orders
43

43

00:01:55.530  -->  00:01:58.500
to validate the audits that was done.
44

44

00:01:58.500  -->  00:02:01.860
Then in case of issues, you can identify root causes
45

45

00:02:01.860  -->  00:02:03.540
and then you can generate reports
46

46

00:02:03.540  -->  00:02:06.000
that can be ready for audits.
47

47

00:02:06.000  -->  00:02:06.900
All right, that's it.
48

48

00:02:06.900  -->  00:02:09.993
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
