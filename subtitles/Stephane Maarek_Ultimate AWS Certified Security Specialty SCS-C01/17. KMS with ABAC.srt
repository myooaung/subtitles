00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:00,833
<v Instructor>So just something</v>
2

2

00:00:00,833  -->  00:00:02,130
that can come up in the exam.
3

3

00:00:02,130  -->  00:00:04,440
It's around attribute-based access control,
4

4

00:00:04,440  -->  00:00:06,720
so ABAC with KMS.
5

5

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:09,510
So with this, you control access to your KMS keys,
6

6

00:00:09,510  -->  00:00:11,250
not based on IAM policies and so on,
7

7

00:00:11,250  -->  00:00:13,770
but based on tags and aliases.
8

8

00:00:13,770  -->  00:00:14,940
So how does that work?
9

9

00:00:14,940  -->  00:00:18,060
Well, a user will have an IAM policy, but we say
10

10

00:00:18,060  -->  00:00:22,140
that we can access any key for decrypt, encrypt and so on
11

11

00:00:22,140  -->  00:00:26,190
as long as the resource tag on that key is environment prod,
12

12

00:00:26,190  -->  00:00:28,950
meaning we have access to all the prod keys.
13

13

00:00:28,950  -->  00:00:30,300
And in this KMS key,
14

14

00:00:30,300  -->  00:00:33,480
we'll just have a tag environment equals prod.
15

15

00:00:33,480  -->  00:00:36,240
And this way our user will have allowed access
16

16

00:00:36,240  -->  00:00:37,590
into this KMS key.
17

17

00:00:37,590  -->  00:00:39,570
This is one way to have security
18

18

00:00:39,570  -->  00:00:42,270
at scale and one example that can come up in the exam.
19

19

00:00:42,270  -->  00:00:43,860
So this was a very short lecture.
20

20

00:00:43,860  -->  00:00:46,983
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
