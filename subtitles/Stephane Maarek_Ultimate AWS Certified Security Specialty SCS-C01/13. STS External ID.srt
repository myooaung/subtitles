00:00:00,240  -->  00:00:01,980
<v Instructor>So we're still talking about STS</v>
2

2

00:00:01,980  -->  00:00:05,700
and now we're talking about security of the AssumeRole API.
3

3

00:00:05,700  -->  00:00:08,400
So when you're using the AssumeRole API,
4

4

00:00:08,400  -->  00:00:12,600
you have the option to pass in what's called an external ID.
5

5

00:00:12,600  -->  00:00:14,880
And this external ID has a purpose.
6

6

00:00:14,880  -->  00:00:17,161
It's a security mechanism.
7

7

00:00:17,161  -->  00:00:22,161
When you have a external ID in the AssumeRole IAM policy,
8

8

00:00:22,260  -->  00:00:25,740
then the role can only be assumed if the API call
9

9

00:00:25,740  -->  00:00:29,460
made it to assume that role also contains the external id
10

10

00:00:29,460  -->  00:00:33,990
you have defined, for example, in this example 56789.
11

11

00:00:33,990  -->  00:00:37,470
It solves what's called the Confused Deputy problem.
12

12

00:00:37,470  -->  00:00:39,480
And this problem I'm going to explain you
13

13

00:00:39,480  -->  00:00:40,650
in the next slide.
14

14

00:00:40,650  -->  00:00:43,830
This prevents you from having any other customer
15

15

00:00:43,830  -->  00:00:46,170
from tricking, for example, a 3rd party
16

16

00:00:46,170  -->  00:00:49,020
into accessing your resources.
17

17

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:53,070
So it's quite confusing, I know, but hear me out.
18

18

00:00:53,070  -->  00:00:54,120
So let's say, for example,
19

19

00:00:54,120  -->  00:00:57,750
that you have a deputy and it's a 3rd party account
20

20

00:00:57,750  -->  00:01:00,510
and you give access to the deputy to your account.
21

21

00:01:00,510  -->  00:01:03,150
For example, it needs to be able to manage resources
22

22

00:01:03,150  -->  00:01:04,410
in your accounts.
23

23

00:01:04,410  -->  00:01:08,250
So your accounts may have an IAM role and use this IAM role
24

24

00:01:08,250  -->  00:01:11,310
trust the 3rd party to assume that role.
25

25

00:01:11,310  -->  00:01:14,250
Now, an IAM user that's, for example, we're not
26

26

00:01:14,250  -->  00:01:17,310
using external ID for now, we does not pass external id.
27

27

00:01:17,310  -->  00:01:18,870
You're going to tell the deputy, "Hey,
28

28

00:01:18,870  -->  00:01:22,260
please assume my role here is the role ARN."
29

29

00:01:22,260  -->  00:01:24,540
And then the deputy is going to assume the role
30

30

00:01:24,540  -->  00:01:26,340
and then access the role and your resources
31

31

00:01:26,340  -->  00:01:27,390
within your account.
32

32

00:01:27,390  -->  00:01:29,160
And we're very happy, right?
33

33

00:01:29,160  -->  00:01:30,960
But there's a catch with this.
34

34

00:01:30,960  -->  00:01:32,490
If you have another account,
35

35

00:01:32,490  -->  00:01:35,730
another AWS account, that is going to tell the deputy,
36

36

00:01:35,730  -->  00:01:39,930
hey, can you access my ARN role,
37

37

00:01:39,930  -->  00:01:43,050
but this time the ARN is not coming from its own accounts
38

38

00:01:43,050  -->  00:01:46,770
coming from our accounts, the example ARN,
39

39

00:01:46,770  -->  00:01:50,700
then the deputy is going to assume the role
40

40

00:01:50,700  -->  00:01:53,100
and access the resources.
41

41

00:01:53,100  -->  00:01:56,130
And so you may say in which type of use case
42

42

00:01:56,130  -->  00:01:57,810
can this be exploited?
43

43

00:01:57,810  -->  00:01:59,730
Well, imagine that the deputy, for example,
44

44

00:01:59,730  -->  00:02:02,400
is a software as a service company
45

45

00:02:02,400  -->  00:02:05,340
and the software's service company has access
46

46

00:02:05,340  -->  00:02:08,340
to many different accounts to perform its roles
47

47

00:02:08,340  -->  00:02:10,530
and its job functions.
48

48

00:02:10,530  -->  00:02:12,330
And let's say I am a user.
49

49

00:02:12,330  -->  00:02:15,840
And I guess what is your IAM role in your accounts?
50

50

00:02:15,840  -->  00:02:18,870
Because I know your account ID and I know your role name.
51

51

00:02:18,870  -->  00:02:21,360
Then I will connect to this software as a service
52

52

00:02:21,360  -->  00:02:25,230
and I will pass in your ARN, and click on connect.
53

53

00:02:25,230  -->  00:02:28,080
And then the SAS will give me access to your account.
54

54

00:02:28,080  -->  00:02:30,390
This is obviously not something you want, right?
55

55

00:02:30,390  -->  00:02:33,750
So this is what's called the confused deputy.
56

56

00:02:33,750  -->  00:02:36,120
And so what's going to happen is that we're going
57

57

00:02:36,120  -->  00:02:39,270
to use external ID to fix that problem.
58

58

00:02:39,270  -->  00:02:42,990
So here the deputy is also going to generate an external id,
59

59

00:02:42,990  -->  00:02:45,870
for example, 5678 for our accounts.
60

60

00:02:45,870  -->  00:02:48,180
And so the IAM role is going to be edited
61

61

00:02:48,180  -->  00:02:51,030
so that the IAM role trusts the third-party
62

62

00:02:51,030  -->  00:02:55,200
only if the external ID is equal to 56789.
63

63

00:02:55,200  -->  00:02:58,200
So in the use case of what we did before,
64

64

00:02:58,200  -->  00:03:00,600
we're going to also use our own external ID
65

65

00:03:00,600  -->  00:03:01,433
because we know it.
66

66

00:03:01,433  -->  00:03:05,070
So we can do the AssumeRole with the proper external ID
67

67

00:03:05,070  -->  00:03:06,660
and then we're good to go.
68

68

00:03:06,660  -->  00:03:10,170
But if the other account, which has its own external ID,
69

69

00:03:10,170  -->  00:03:13,320
by the way, is trying to guess our ARN,
70

70

00:03:13,320  -->  00:03:15,300
it doesn't know our external id
71

71

00:03:15,300  -->  00:03:19,050
so it's going to pass a random external ID or its own
72

72

00:03:19,050  -->  00:03:22,050
and then we're not going to be able to assume that role.
73

73

00:03:22,050  -->  00:03:24,300
So this external ID is going to be generated
74

74

00:03:24,300  -->  00:03:27,000
by the deputy and then you add it in your trust policy
75

75

00:03:27,000  -->  00:03:28,920
of the IAM role and it will solve
76

76

00:03:28,920  -->  00:03:31,170
this confused deputy problem.
77

77

00:03:31,170  -->  00:03:32,400
So hopefully that makes sense
78

78

00:03:32,400  -->  00:03:35,460
and this will allow you to answer maybe one exam question.
79

79

00:03:35,460  -->  00:03:37,530
So I hope you liked it and I will see you
80

80

00:03:37,530  -->  00:03:38,553
in the next lecture.
