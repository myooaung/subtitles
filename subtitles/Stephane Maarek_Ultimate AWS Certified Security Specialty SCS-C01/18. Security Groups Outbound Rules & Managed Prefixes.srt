00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,860
<v Instructor>So let's talk about security groups,</v>
2

2

00:00:01,860  -->  00:00:03,480
outbound rules for a second.
3

3

00:00:03,480  -->  00:00:07,860
By default the outbound rules allow anywhere with this CIDR,
4

4

00:00:07,860  -->  00:00:11,580
but we can remove and just allow specific prefixes.
5

5

00:00:11,580  -->  00:00:13,710
So here is an example of an outbound rule,
6

6

00:00:13,710  -->  00:00:17,910
and as you can see, it authorizes the port 443
7

7

00:00:17,910  -->  00:00:22,080
of a destination to be Amazon S3 in the US East 1.
8

8

00:00:22,080  -->  00:00:26,250
So it looks like from this we have used a prefix destination
9

9

00:00:26,250  -->  00:00:29,310
so that the only amount authorized is to S3.
10

10

00:00:29,310  -->  00:00:31,110
And so as such, we can introduce the concept
11

11

00:00:31,110  -->  00:00:32,940
of managed prefix lists.
12

12

00:00:32,940  -->  00:00:36,210
So it's one or more CIDR blocks and it makes it easier
13

13

00:00:36,210  -->  00:00:38,070
for you to configure your security groups
14

14

00:00:38,070  -->  00:00:39,840
and your route tables.
15

15

00:00:39,840  -->  00:00:41,190
So in your account, for example,
16

16

00:00:41,190  -->  00:00:43,680
you can define your custom prefix list.
17

17

00:00:43,680  -->  00:00:47,670
For example, this CIDR 1, CIDR 2, and CIDR 3.
18

18

00:00:47,670  -->  00:00:49,920
You can share them to another account
19

19

00:00:49,920  -->  00:00:52,380
such as in the security group, inbound rules.
20

20

00:00:52,380  -->  00:00:54,810
You can actually reference the prefix list
21

21

00:00:54,810  -->  00:00:56,940
that you've defined in Account A.
22

22

00:00:56,940  -->  00:01:00,000
So these customer manage prefix lists are a set
23

23

00:01:00,000  -->  00:01:02,400
of CIDR that you define and that you manage yourself,
24

24

00:01:02,400  -->  00:01:04,230
and they can be shared with other accounts
25

25

00:01:04,230  -->  00:01:06,270
or within your organization.
26

26

00:01:06,270  -->  00:01:08,520
This allows you, for example, that if the Account A
27

27

00:01:08,520  -->  00:01:11,520
wants to modify the prefix list once,
28

28

00:01:11,520  -->  00:01:15,120
it will be applied to many security groups at once.
29

29

00:01:15,120  -->  00:01:19,170
The other option is to use the AWS managed prefix list.
30

30

00:01:19,170  -->  00:01:22,470
So it's a set of CIDR for AWS services,
31

31

00:01:22,470  -->  00:01:25,620
but you can't create, modify, share, or delete them.
32

32

00:01:25,620  -->  00:01:27,000
You can only use them.
33

33

00:01:27,000  -->  00:01:29,670
And some of the services that may be important
34

34

00:01:29,670  -->  00:01:32,040
that you can already reference using this managed
35

35

00:01:32,040  -->  00:01:36,000
prefix list are Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront,
36

36

00:01:36,000  -->  00:01:39,030
DynamoDB, and Ground Station, and they may be others,
37

37

00:01:39,030  -->  00:01:40,920
but those are the most important.
38

38

00:01:40,920  -->  00:01:42,270
All right, that's it for this lecture.
39

39

00:01:42,270  -->  00:01:45,220
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
